Nutrition guidelines for young children,https://www.babycenter.com/0_nutrition-guidelines-for-young-children_9245.bc,"Toddlers develop curiosity about food and master new eating skills as they grow. Certain foods are more appropriate at certain ages, and every child has unique dietary needs (and preferences). To make sure your child gets enough of all the right stuff, see these tips for healthy snacks and meals, and follow the guidelines below.Nutrition for toddlersWhere should those building-block calories come from? Ideally from a diet rich in grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy products, and lean meat. (A few calories may sneak in as fats and sweets too.)Here's a quick overview of what your child needs every day from each food group. Keep in mind that these are estimates, and your child may need more or less depending on how active she is or whether she's still breastfeeding. Your child's doctor can answer any questions you have about your child's diet.GrainsGrains come in two types  whole grains and refined grains. Products made from whole grains contain the entire grain kernel and have more fiber, iron, and B vitamins than refined grains. Examples of whole grains are whole wheat flour and bread, bulgur, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, brown rice, and whole wheat pasta.Refined grains have been processed to give them a finer texture and a longer shelf life. Refined grain products include white flour and bread, white rice, and most kinds of pasta.Some foods are made from both whole grains and refined grains.The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) recommends getting at least half of your grains from whole grains.How much toddlers need daily: At least 1 1/2 ounce equivalents of grain.How much is in an ounce of grains: An ounce of grains equals one slice of bread, 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal, or 1/2 cup of cooked pasta or cooked cereal.Examples of the daily requirement:1/2 cup of cereal for breakfast, one slice of bread for lunch.1/2 cup (one packet instant) oatmeal for breakfast, three whole wheat crackers for snack.One 3-inch pancake for breakfast, one slice of bread for lunch.VegetablesOver the course of a week, try to serve your child lots of different-colored vegetables  dark green broccoli, light green beans, orange carrots, red tomatoes, and so on. That way you'll be sure he's getting all the nutrients each vegetable has to offer.How much toddlers need daily: 2 to 3 tablespoons.Examples of the daily requirement:1 tablespoon cooked chopped broccoli trees for lunch, 1 or 2 tablespoons cooked beets mashed or chopped into small pieces for dinner.1/4 cup carrot juice for lunch or snack, 1 tablespoon mashed potato for dinner.Two or three sweet potato fries for lunch, 1 tablespoon mashed peas for dinner.FruitFrozen and canned fruit is just as healthy as fresh fruit as long as it's packed in water or juice with no added sugar or syrup. Choose fruit over fruit juice because it contains fiber that juice doesn't have. Plus, juice often has added sugar.How much toddlers need daily: 1/2 to 3/4 cup.How much is in a cup of fruit: A cup of fruit equals 1 cup of fresh, frozen, or canned fruit; 1/2 cup dried fruit; 1/2 of a large apple; one 8- or 9-inch banana; and one medium (4-inch diameter) grapefruit.Examples of the daily requirement:1/4 cup applesauce for snack, half a banana (cut up or mashed) for lunch.1/4 cup grapes (cut in quarters) for a snack and four large strawberries (cut into 1/2-inch pieces) for dessert1/4 cup chopped apple for breakfast, one 4-ounce snack container of drained, chopped peaches (in water or juice) for snack or dessert.DairyIf your child is no longer breastfeeding after her first birthday, she'll need cow's milk or other dairy products to help get enough calcium and protein. Children younger than 2 need to stick to full-fat dairy products. After their second birthday, children can begin switching to low-fat or fat-free dairy products.How much toddlers need daily: About 1 to 1 1/2 cups.How much is in a cup of dairy: A cup of dairy can be 1 cup milk, yogurt, or soy milk; 1 1/2 ounces, two slices, or 1/3 cup shredded hard cheese such as cheddar, mozzarella, Swiss, or Parmesan; 2 ounces processed (American) cheese; 1/2 cup ricotta cheese; 2 cups cottage cheese; 1 cup pudding made with milk; or 1 1/2 cups ice cream.Examples of the daily requirement:1/2 cup whole milk for breakfast, one slice of cheddar cheese for lunch, 1/2 cup whole milk for dinner.1/2 cup whole milk for breakfast, 1/2 cup yogurt for lunch or snack, 1/2 cup whole milk for dinner.1/2 cup whole milk for breakfast, 1/2 cup yogurt for lunch, 1/2 cup ice cream for dessert.ProteinMeat, poultry, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, soy products, and nuts and seeds are all protein foods. (Beans and peas are also part of the vegetable food group.) Unless you're raising a vegetarian child, try to serve seafood at least twice a week.How much toddlers need daily: About two ounce equivalents.How much is in an ounce of protein: An ounce of meat, fish, or poultry; one egg; 1 tablespoon of nut butter; 1/4 cup of cooked beans; and 1/8 cup of tofu all equal one ounce equivalent of protein.Examples of the daily requirement:One egg for breakfast, 1/4 cup cooked, mashed black beans for dinner.1 tablespoon peanut butter (spread thinly on bread or crackers) for lunch, 1 ounce tuna for dinner.One slice turkey for lunch, 1/4 cup cooked lentils for dinner.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2016a.

Pregnant with multiples: Nutrition and fitness needs,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pregnant-with-multiples-nutrition-and-fitness-needs_3580.bc,"Do I need to eat more if I'm pregnant with multiples?Yes. If you're pregnant with multiples, you need more calories than a woman who's carrying just one baby.A general guideline is to add 300 calories a day for each baby. So if you're carrying twins, you'd add roughly 600 calories to your usual diet. This amount may be different if you were overweight or underweight before you got pregnant, so talk with your provider to come up with an eating plan that has the number of calories that's appropriate for you.Whether you're carrying twins, triplets, or more, plan to eatat least five times a day(three meals and two substantial snacks), even if you don't feel especially hungry.Of course,not all calories are created equal. Make each one count by limiting sugar and eating a variety of foodspacked with the nutrients you need, including protein, carbohydrates, andfats. Cheese, milk, meat, eggs, nuts, and healthy oils all fuel your babies' growth. Round out your diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.How much weight should I gain if I'm pregnant with multiples?Gaining the right amount of weight is necessary to nourish your growing babies. Try to put on pounds starting early in the pregnancy  when your babies are developing rapidly and you still have room to fill your stomach. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends the following weight gain ranges for women carrying twins based on their pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI):37 to 54 pounds if you started at a normal weight (BMI of 18.5 to 24.9)31 to 50 pounds if you were overweight (BMI of 25 to 29.9)25 to 42 pounds if you were obese (BMI of 30 or higher)According to the IOM, there isn't enough data to make weight gain recommendations for women pregnant with triplets or more. If you're expecting three or more babies, ask your provider for a weight gain target that's right for you.If you were underweight before pregnancy, you'll have to put on extra weight quickly to catch up. Your provider can help you set healthy weight goals throughout your pregnancy. Live birth: TwinsFollow one woman through her pregnancy with twins and watch her give birth.Will I need to take a special kind of prenatal vitamin?Prenatal vitamins are important, but you don't need a special formula for twins and triplets. A standardprenatal supplementwill do just fine.A supplement is the best way to ensure that you get vital nutrients such as folic acid,iron, andcalcium. Your provider can recommend specific brands and doses.Women carrying more than one baby are at a higher risk foriron-deficiency anemiaduring pregnancy. Your provider will monitor your iron level to make sure you're getting enough. If you're not, she may recommend that you take an iron supplement.High doses of iron can sometimes lead to constipation andnausea, so talk to your provider about ways to avoid these problems.How much water do I need if I'm pregnant with multiples?Even if you're the type of person who never goes anywhere without a water bottle, pay extra attention to how much water you're drinking now that you're carrying multiples. Women who are pregnant with one baby are advised to drink 10 8-ounce cups of water (or other hydrating beverages) each day, so that's probably a good starting point for you too.But every woman is different  you may need a little more or less water than someone else. Ask your provider for specific advice on fluid intake.Of course, drinking extra fluids means you'll be making extra trips to the bathroom (especially as your babies grow larger), but you can use this as a chance to check if you're hydrated. Aim to drink enough water to keep your urine clear or pale yellow. If it's cloudy or dark yellow, drink more.It's especially important to prevent dehydration in the second half of pregnancy because having multiples can raise the risk ofpremature labor and early delivery.Can I exercise if I'm pregnant with multiples?If you're a healthy, active woman with multiples on the way, you can probably continue to exercise during your pregnancy, as long as your provider gives you the go-ahead.Keep it slow, relaxed, and gentle. Your body  and your babies  may not be able to handle intense workouts. Good options includeswimming,walking, andprenatal yoga.Be sure you're hydrated before, during, and after your workout. And no matter what exercise you enjoy, stop immediately if you develop signs of overheating, such as nausea, dizziness, or a racing heart.That said, carrying more than one baby is a workout in itself, and some women may need to commit to extra rest or avoid doing certain types of exercise. For example, aerobic exercise may be off-limits if you're at risk of delivering your baby early.Discuss your workout routine with your provider to make sure you and your baby stay healthy during your pregnancy, and be sure to tell your provider if you develop signs of preterm labor, such as abdominal pain or bleeding. Preterm labor is a reason for you to stop exercising altogether.Learn more:Pregnant with multiples: Prenatal careTwins fetal development month by monthNational Organization of Mothers of Twins ClubsShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

But eating well when you're pregnant doesn't need to be difficult: A few simple, online tools can help you make sure you're getting the nutrients you and your baby need.Here's a look at general nutrition guidelines and how you can use them to plan meals during your pregnancy.MyPlateYou may remember the Food Guide Pyramid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which outlined how many daily servings you should eat from different categories of food. That pyramid has been adapted to become MyPlate, a system for choosing healthy food based on the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans.The site even has a section onhealth and nutrition for pregnant and breastfeeding women, featuring a personalized tracking system that suggests meal plans based on your age, height, pre-pregnancy weight, activity level, and trimester.MyPlate divides food into five main groups  grains, fruit, vegetables, protein, and dairy  plus oils. To get an individualized meal plan with general guidelines on what to choose from each group, enter your information at ChooseMyPlate.gov.A sample MyPlate planHere's a quick look at the MyPlate food groups and what a customized plan might recommend.This sample plan is designed for a 32-year-old woman who is 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighed 130 pounds before she got pregnant, is in her second trimester, and gets less than 30 minutes of daily physical activity. (Of course, your plan may be very different.)Grains: 7 ounces a dayGenerally, an ounce of grains equals one slice of bread, one small corn or flour tortilla, 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal, or 1/2 cup of cooked cereal, rice, or pasta. Get at least half of your daily grains from whole grains (like whole wheat bread or brown rice). Whole grains contain the most fiber, vitamins, and nutrients.Fruits: 2 cups a dayVary the color of the fruit you eat, and choose fresh over frozen or canned whenever possible. Many packaged varieties are preserved in sugary liquid, so choose products without added sugar.Bonus: The fiber in fruit helps prevent hemorrhoidsandconstipation, two common side effects of pregnancy.Vegetables: 3 cups a dayFresh vegetables taste better than canned or frozen, and they're also a better choice if you want to limit sodium and avoid preservatives. But when it comes to fiber and vitamins, plain canned and frozen veggies are just as nutritious as fresh. For maximum nutrition, vary the color of the vegetables you choose. Broccoli, for example, is packed with folate, calcium, and B vitamins. Sweet potatoes provide vitamin A, vitamin C, and fiber.Meat and beans: 6 ounces a dayThis equals about two servings that are each about the size of a deck of cards. Choose lean meat and limitfishto 12 ounces per week. (More than that may expose your baby to potentially harmful levels of mercury.)Dairy: 3 cups a dayIn the MyPlate plan, 1 cup of dairy equals 1 cup of milk or yogurt, 1 1/2 ounces of natural cheese, and 2 ounces of processed cheese. In general, dairy products are a great source of calcium and protein.Fats and oils: 6 teaspoons a dayThe best sources include canola oil, olive oil, safflower oil, fatty fish, avocados, nuts, seeds, and olives. Note: An avocado is a fruit, but it's included in the oils category because most of its calories come from fat.Discretionary calories: 266 a dayThis MyPlate sample plan budgets 266 ""extra"" calories that you use how you like, but you must include them in your daily calorie budget. In other words, you could have a scoop of ice cream or put some sugar in your decaf iced tea, but these discretionary calories count toward your daily total (2,200 in this case). How it all adds upOnce you've created your daily food plan, don't try to hit exact numbers in each category. Instead, shoot for an average that's in the desired range over the course of a week or so.As your pregnancy progresses, you'll need to eat a little more because your nutrition needs changeduring the different stages of pregnancy.If you eat roughly the amount recommended for each food group, take a prenatal vitamin daily, and consistently gain a reasonable amount of weight (about a pound per week in the second and third trimesters), you and your baby will be well nourished.The Harvard Healthy Eating PlateNot everyone agrees that the USDA's MyPlate is the best model for good nutrition. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have created their own eating guide, called theHealthy Eating Plate, which they believe better reflects current research on a balanced diet.The Harvard Healthy Eating Plate puts greater emphasis on whole grain foods, recommends healthy vegetable oils, and encourages limiting milk and dairy products to one or two servings a day. It also suggests limiting red meat (and avoiding processed meat altogether) and refined grains, such as white bread and white rice.The Healthy Eating Plate also encourages drinking plenty of water and skipping sugary drinks, and highlights the importance of daily exercise.Harvard's plan encourages you to eat more vegetables because most Americans don't eat enough from this important food group. One exception: Unlike the USDA's MyPlate, the Healthy Eating Plate does not include potatoes in its list of recommended vegetables. That's because potatoes are full of rapidly digested starch and have the same effect on blood sugar as sweets.Which model is best to follow during pregnancy?You can't go wrong with either version. Because experts don't completely agree, you can expect to find slight variations in their recommendations, but the two plans have plenty in common.Even if you can't follow either program to the letter, each gives you something to strive for, says Alan R. Fleischman, neonatologist and medical director of the March of Dimes. Eating nutritiously during pregnancy can pay huge dividends for the rest of your baby's life.""We know that some simple dietary changes can greatly improve the chances of having a healthy baby. For example, consuming 400 micrograms of the B vitaminfolic acidevery day before pregnancy begins and during early pregnancy significantly reduces the risk of a serious birth defect of the brain and spine,"" says Fleischman. ""Poor nutrition during pregnancy has lifelong effects on the growth and development of your baby. It's more important to eat wisely during pregnancy than practically any other time in life.""Do these food guidelines always apply?There are five exceptions to the guidelines. If any of these apply to you, or if you have other concerns, talk to your healthcare provider about your personal nutritional needs.If you're significantlyoverweight, you might do better with fewer calories, but talk to your provider to make sure you're getting the nutrients your baby needs.If you're significantlyunderweight, you'll need to get more calories.If you're a teenager, you'll also need more.If you're expectingmultiples, you'll have additional nutrition needs.If you developgestational diabetesor have pre-existing diabetes, a registered dietitian can help you plan your diet. It will emphasize eating whole foods and getting a consistent amount of carbohydrates at each meal. You'll also need to monitor your blood sugar levels closely and communicate regularly with your team of healthcare providers.Sample menu for a pregnant womanHere's an example of a daily menu specifically designed for our ""sample mom,"" with a few extra snack suggestions.

Moms Get Serious About Health and Fitness in 2007,https://www.babycenter.com/0_moms-get-serious-about-health-and-fitness-in-2007_10415046.bc,"Press contact:BabyCenter Public Relations Staffpublic_relations@babycenter.comNew Survey Highlights the Importance of Health and Fitness During Preconception and Pregnancy(San Francisco, CA) - February 22, 2007 - According to BabyCenter, LLC, (""BabyCenter"") the leading online resource for new and expectant parents, a majority of women increase their focus on health, fitness and nutrition once they become a mother, than before they planned to conceive and/or had a child. New research shows approximately 65 percent of women exercise more or try to exercise more since becoming mothers, and 82 percent reported eating healthier since becoming a mom.""We found that becoming a mom is a catalyst for getting healthy. Women begin making diet and exercise changes during pregnancy and those changes stay with them long after the baby is born. In our survey, three out of four women say they change their eating habits during pregnancy and after their kids are born, and more than half say they exercise more since becoming moms,"" said Linda Murray, editor in chief, BabyCenter. ""Motherhood is good for your health.""BabyCenter recently surveyed approximately 600 members looking for greater insight on the role of health and nutrition in women in the preconception and pregnancy stages. The research, conducted in partnership with AVEENO Baby, a Johnson & Johnson Consumer Products Company brand and leader in ACTIVE NATURALS technology, found of the 40 percent of members planning to begin or expand their family in 2007, there was an overall commitment to healthier lifestyles whether trying to conceive, while pregnant, or while caring for a baby or toddler.Exercise and FitnessMore than 75 percent of the women in the survey reported that being physically fit is somewhat or very important. Most moms, 57 percent, exercise on a weekly basis, with the majority walking to stay in shape. Nearly a quarter of pregnant moms say they plan to take yoga.""Walking is one of the best exercises for moms-to-be. It's safe throughout pregnancy and easy to start doing even if you've never exercised before. Regular strolls are also a great stress reliever,"" said Murray.Since becoming pregnant, 14 percent of moms increased their amount of exercise, while 43 percent exercised less often. At least 55 percent of pregnant moms exercised on their own while their child was occupied or in the care of others, while 41 percent exercised with their child in or out of the home. Only eight percent belonged to parent/child interactive exercise groups.""AVEENO Baby supports the active lifestyle of healthy moms,"" said Colleen Sellers, Product Director, AVEENO Brand. ""From our own research, we know that our consumers are women who enjoy the outdoors and exercise like walking and yoga. So, we are pleased to learn BabyCenter moms are committed to raising healthy children and understand and embrace the very important role of fitness during pregnancy and while trying to conceive.""Nutrition and DietJust as important as fitness and exercise, the survey results illustrated the value placed on healthy eating habits and a proper diet. At least 66 percent of respondents feel they have moderately healthy eating habits, while 13 percent feel they have very healthy eating habits. More than half of moms feel their eating habits have changed slightly since becoming pregnant, while 27 percent feel they have changed significantly. Approximately 34 percent of respondents feel eating organic or natural food is important.""Eating healthy during pregnancy is not only important for mom, but the future of her child's health"" said Murray. ""The days when pregnant women indulged their every craving and happily ate for two are over. Today, moms are embracing everything from natural ingredients in their favorite foods, to choosing organic foods for both themselves and their families.""Learn more information on nutrition during pregnancy in the BabyCenter pregnancy nutrition guide.Additionally, the BabyCenter Is It Safe Guide is a comprehensive resource for women interested in learning more about safe alternatives to diet and exercise during pregnancy.###About BabyCenter LLCBabyCenter is the worlds partner in parenting.

Seven facts about pregnancy after weight-loss surgery,https://www.babycenter.com/0_seven-facts-about-pregnancy-after-weight-loss-surgery_1504874.bc,"Weight-loss surgery (also called bariatric or gastric bypass surgery) is becoming ever more common  according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of people getting gastric bypass surgery increased ninefold from 1996 to 2004. But how do these kinds of surgeries affect getting pregnant and pregnancy itself? Here are seven facts you should know about it.1. You may get a boost in fertilityBariatric surgery can produce a sudden positive change in your fertility. A report in a November 2005 issue of the Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing found that women with fertility problems linked to obesity who have the surgery can start ovulating regularly for the first time in years.And if you have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), your fertility should also get a boost after surgery. A study published in the December 2005 issue of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that post-surgery weight loss for women with PCOS resolved their metabolic and reproductive abnormalities.Important caveat: This newfound fertility can raise your chances of getting pregnant by accident if you haven't been using birth control  a problem if you're in the initial 18-month post-surgery period (see below). Read about your birth control options.2. You should wait 18 months before getting pregnantIt's safe to get pregnant after bariatric surgery  after your weight stabilizes. After surgery, your body goes through potentially stressful changes and significant nutritional upheaval, which can pose problems for a growing baby.""Pregnancy after weight-loss surgery isn't an issue. The only concern is [getting pregnant] in the period of rapid weight loss,"" says Philip Schauer, director of advanced laparoscopic and bariatric surgery at the Cleveland Clinic's Bariatric and Metabolic Institute.To protect women and their babies from potential malnutrition, doctors recommend that women not get pregnant until 18 months after surgery. A report in a November 2005 issue of the Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing explained that getting pregnant at least 18 months after surgery reduces the ""potential for maternal and fetal malnutrition and small-for-gestational-age infants."" By then, Schauer says, a woman should have reached a stable weight and be able to provide her baby with enough nutrition. 3. You'll need to monitor your nutrient intake closelyEven past the initial post-surgery period, many women have nutritional deficiencies that can be problematic during pregnancy. A study in the April 2006 issue of the American Journal of Medical Science found that the most common nutritional complications associated with bariatric surgery are deficiencies in B12, iron, calcium, and vitamin D. In some cases, post-surgery patients can experience protein-calorie malnutrition and fat malabsorption. After surgery, many women eat as few as 500 calories a day and often have to take extra vitamins to compensate for the ways in which their bodies no longer metabolize nutrients.It may be extra difficult to get the nutrients you need during pregnancy because of nausea  a common post-surgery complication that morning sickness can exacerbate. If nausea has killed your appetite or you can't keep food down, talk to your healthcare provider about antinausea drugs that you can safely take during pregnancy.To make sure you and your baby are getting enough nutrients, see a nutritionist who's knowledgeable about weight-loss surgery. You can find a nutritionist (also called a dietitian) on the American Dietetic Association website  just click on Find a Nutrition Professional. Tell her what kind of surgery you had, how much weight you've gained during pregnancy so far, and your nutritional likes or dislikes. She may recommend that you eat several small meals throughout the day, which improves nutrient absorption.You should also have your provider check your vitamin levels regularly. She may suggest that you take additional vitamin supplements.4. You may need to educate your ob-gynSince the weight-loss surgery boom is relatively recent, many ob-gyns don't know how to treat women who've had it. Moms who have had the surgery say they've been put in the awkward position of educating their obstetricians.""I'm their guinea pig,"" joked Kimberly Jensen, a stay-at-home mom to Ethan in Cheyenne, Wyoming, when she was pregnant after weight-loss surgery. ""They're learning how to treat women who've had weight-loss surgery through me. I'm only their first or second patient who's had the surgery.""If you've had weight-loss surgery and you recently got pregnant or want to get pregnant, start the ball rolling by talking to all your healthcare providers early, recommends Phelan. This will give them a chance to do some research and have the most up-to-date facts at hand when caring for your health. 5. Your risk of complications drops, but doesn't go awayA 2005 study in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology found that women who had weight-loss surgery developed pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes at rates similar to those of healthy-weight women who'd never been obese or had weight-loss surgery.But since many women who get weight-loss surgery are still plus-size to some degree when they become pregnant, moms-to-be can expect their doctors to keep a closer watch on their pregnancies, says Sharon Phelan, an obstetrician in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who has treated many plus-size women during pregnancy, including women who have had weight-loss surgery.""You're still at risk for gestational diabetes [if you're plus-size but have had weight-loss surgery], but the risk is far less than before surgery,"" says Phelan.For example, Celeste Olivares, a 41-year-old nurse and mother of two, lost more than 150 pounds from gastric banding and was 237 pounds when she became pregnant with her first child in 2005. Her diabetes and cardiomyopathy (a form of heart inflammation) had gone away completely after the weight loss, but she continued to monitor her blood sugar during pregnancy. At 30 weeks, her blood sugar rose slightly and her doctor put her on insulin as a protective measure.6. You may face a body-image battleOne of the biggest emotional effects of pregnancy for post-surgery women, says Phelan, arises from body image. Not only does a woman have to get used to the idea that her belly will grow again, but she may also have some scars from the surgery that don't stretch very well as she grows.""Psychologically, a lot of women who've had surgery to lose weight have a very hard time accepting that they have to gain weight,"" says Phelan. ""They have to get comfortable with the fact that 'Yes, now is the time to gain weight.' Another emotional part of pregnancy is that it's stressful and people tend to eat when they're stressed.""So women run the risk of going to extremes  either dieting while pregnant, which can have serious nutritional consequences for the baby, or gaining back some of the weight they lost because they're eating more food. There's also the problem of food pushers, Phelan notes. These are the people who, seeing you're pregnant, say, ""Go ahead, have another slice of cake!""Kimberly Jensen says she did worry about gaining weight during her pregnancy. ""Everyone told me not to worry about weight gain,"" she says. ""But that was my biggest fear, gaining weight. It's tricky because you can be dieting even though you don't think you're dieting. The key is to think about the baby before you eat, so you're thinking about what's best for him.""7. You're more likely to have a cesareanPregnant women who've had bariatric surgery are more likely to end up with a c-section, according to a 2004 study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. It's not clear exactly why this is the case and what factors are involved, but it helps to talk to your healthcare provider.Does your provider consider you at high risk for a c-section, and if so, why? Ask about your provider's c-section rate and philosophy about c-sections in general. If you have no serious health problems, is the provider fine with trying vaginal delivery? During a vaginal delivery, what might cause your provider to order a c-section intervention?Also, you may be able reduce your odds of having a c-section by following your doctor's weight-gain recommendations, exercising during pregnancy, and taking childbirth preparation classes.Learn more about c-sections and what the recovery is like."

How to get your preschooler to eat more healthy food,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-get-your-preschooler-to-eat-more-healthy-food_64318.bc,"Eating well gives your preschooler the energy he needs to learn and grow. And it'll help him stay healthy, maintain a healthy weight, and establish good lifelong eating habits. Here are some ways to make nutritious food the most appealing choice:Get your preschooler involvedA great way to get your preschooler excited about eating a range of healthy foods is to involve him in the family's meal-planning decisions. Let him help you make out menus and a grocery list. Have him check to see whether you're out of grapes and suggest favorite suppers or breakfasts.When you take him food shopping, ask him to hold the grocery list for you as you shop. Give him a few choices to make along the way: Peaches or mangoes? Peas or carrots? Graham crackers or fig bars?Show your child how you check for specific ingredients on the nutrition labels of the foods you choose  and those you put back on the shelf.Make a habit of selecting one new fruit or vegetable to try each week, keeping in mind that your child may not be interested in trying something unfamiliar until it's been offered numerous times.To encourage your child to take some responsibility for his own nutrition, you could help him create his own daily food chart, with boxes for each category: fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy, and meat/protein. (Check out the United States Department of Agriculture's ready-made chart to get started.)Show your child how to color in or check off the appropriate boxes when he finishes a meal or snack. Then look at the chart together at the end of each day to tally how well he did in meeting his nutritional goals.Encourage his involvement in the kitchenInvite your preschooler to help you in the kitchen. Enlist his help putting toppings on the pizza or vegetables on kabobs. Show him how to wash lettuce and toss a salad. Once he can handle it, help him measure ingredients  an excellent foundation for learning fractions! Make meals and snacks funArrange carrot sticks, cherry tomatoes, and bell peppers to look like a face on your preschooler's plate. Make pancakes in the shape of his initials and cut toast into a heart shape. Offer yogurt or low-fat salad dressing for him to dip pretzels, vegetables, or fruit slices in, and outfit him with a lively placemat and dinnerware. Go to the sourceTake your preschooler on an outing to an orchard, berry farm, or dairy so he can see where the food on his plate comes from. The novelty just might inspire him to try something he wouldn't otherwise be interested in.There's nothing like seeing your own food grow to motivate kids to eat their fruits and veggies. Think about planting your own. Even if you don't have much space, you can grow tomatoes or strawberries in a container on a balcony or patio. A study published in 2007 in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association shows that preschoolers in rural areas are more likely to eat more fruits and veggies if they're grown at home.Be picky about juicesFruit juices count toward your preschooler's daily fruit intake, but be careful about the kind and amount of juice you offer. Serve your preschooler only 100 percent fruit juice or fruit-vegetable juice combinations. (These are full of nutrients and contain less natural sugar than many fruit juices.) Some kids even enjoy vegetable juices straight up!If your preschooler won't drink milk, you may want to find juices that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D, but don't offer fruit ""drinks"" because they may contain as little as 10 percent juice and an array of flavorings and sweeteners.Keep in mind that even the healthiest fruit juices can easily become too much of a good thing. Juice can contribute to childhood obesity and malnourishment because a child who drinks a great deal of juice gets extra calories and, at the same time, not all the nutrients he needs. It can also lead to tooth decay, especially if your child carries around a sippy cup all day long.So limit your child to 4 to 6 ounces of fruit juice per day, and use fresh fruit to meet the rest of his requirement. When he's thirsty, offer him water. (You can also water down your child's juice, half and half, for the flavor of juice with fewer extra calories.)Shake and bakeSmoothies are an easy way to get fruit and other nutritious foods into your child's diet. All you need is a blender and a few simple ingredients. You can use your choice of fresh fruit, frozen fruit such as berries or bananas (peel before freezing), or even canned pineapple or peaches (strain the syrup first).You might want to include tofu or hard-cooked egg whites  they add protein without changing the taste or texture  and a bit of ground flax seed for extra fiber and omega 3s. Blend with fruit juice or add milk, yogurt, or frozen yogurt for a creamier drink and a dose of calcium.Whole wheat and bran muffins and quick breads are a good source of grains and fiber, and they can also be a vehicle for fruits and vegetables. Make or buy them with bananas, blueberries, carrots, pineapple, or zucchini. Fortify but don't foolYou might try incorporating healthy foods into dishes you know your preschooler likes, but don't be sneaky about it. (Even if he falls for it now, he may later feel betrayed when he figures out what's up.)Tell him that you're giving him some special pasta spirals tonight  with spinach mixed in or with broccoli and cheese on top. Better to be up-front and encourage an adventurous approach to eating.Make it countBe aware of your child's nutritional needs, but don't worry about them. It's not hard to meet a preschooler's daily requirements. Here are some easy ways to serve up good nutrition:One tablespoon of peanut butter on one slice of whole wheat bread and an 8-ounce glass of low-fat milk provides plenty of nutrition. Before the age of 4, this menu will fulfill all of your preschooler's protein requirement, one third of his grain recommendation, 50 percent of his daily dairy, 65 percent of his need for zinc, 32 percent of vitamin E, 18 percent of iron, and 65 percent of his calcium needs. For a 4-year-old, it will fulfill 77 percent of his protein needs, 20 percent of his grain recommendation, 50 percent of his dairy, 39 percent of zinc, 28 percent of vitamin E, 13 percent of iron, and 41 percent of his calcium needs.A bowl of bran cereal with raisins (three-quarters cup cereal with three-quarters cup low-fat milk) and half a cup of orange juice will provide an excellent start to a preschooler's day. Before age 4, this menu will fulfill half of your preschooler's fruit recommendation and almost half of his dairy needs, a third of his grain recommendation, 81 percent of protein, 51 percent of iron, 63 percent of zinc, and over 100 percent of his daily need for vitamin C. Once he's 4 years old, it will fulfill a third of his fruit and almost half his dairy requirements, 20 percent of his grain, 56 percent of his protein, 36 percent of his iron, 38 percent of zinc, and over 100 percent of his daily vitamin C needs.If your preschooler is younger than 4, one slice of cheese pizza will provide 89 percent of his protein, 28 percent of his calcium, 35 percent of his iron, and 22 percent of his vitamin A needs for the day. Once he's 4 years old, a slice of cheese pizza will fulfill 61 percent of his protein needs, 18 percent of his calcium, 24 percent of his iron, and 16 percent of his daily need for vitamin A. Find fast-food alternativesMost fast food is full of fat, sugar, salt, and excess calories. An occasional fast-food burger and fries won't cause any harm, but if you have an alternative, take it. Teach your child to select from the healthy options on the menu  yes to the grilled chicken sandwich, no to the fried onion rings, and forget about super-sizing the meal!Or pick and choose: Have the burger but choose apple slices or carrot sticks instead of fries. Do your best to limit these kinds of meals to no more than once a week.Be a good role modelAs you consider all the ways of getting your preschooler to eat well, remember to practice what you preach. If your child sees you eating lots of junk food or skipping meals, you can't expect him to eat properly. Make an effort to eat whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and you and your child will both be better off.Be upbeatForget the food fights. Let your child decide how much he wants to eat. And don't use a sweet treat as a bribe or withhold it as a punishment.Try to make mealtime together  at the table, not in front of the television  as enjoyable as possible, so that your child can establish a good, healthy relationship with food."
7 sources of financial help for you and your preemie,https://www.babycenter.com/0_7-sources-of-financial-help-for-you-and-your-preemie_10371026.bc,"Parents of preemies often qualify for help from the government and private agencies. Your NICU's social worker can help you find the right program for you and help you apply (as early as possible).SSI (Supplemental Security Income)Social Security provides SSI disability benefits to certain infants of low birth weight, whether or not they were born prematurely. A child weighing less than 1,200 grams (about 2 pounds, 10 ounces) at birth or a child weighing between 1,200 and 2,000 grams (about 4 pounds, 6 ounces) at birth and considered small for his gestational age will generally qualify. Qualifying for this federal program also depends on your income and resources.To get benefits, you'll have to have an interview at your local Social Security Administration office. Your NICU social worker can help you navigate this process and tell you what to bring with you to the interview. Before you begin, read the Child Disability Starter Kit on the SSA website. This SSA page will help you find other assistance.If you qualify for SSI, you may also be able to get help from your state or county. For example, in most states, people who get SSI automatically qualify for Medicaid (see below).MedicaidThis joint federal and state program administered by your state can help with health care costs, even if you have health insurance. If you are enrolled in Medicaid and have private insurance, for instance, Medicaid may cover services that your private plan does not.Your eligibility for Medicaid will depend on family income, family size, and other factors (such as citizenship or immigration status). If you were receiving Medicaid when your baby was born, your baby will automatically be eligible for Medicaid, too. As the parent of a baby who's receiving Medicaid, you will be eligible for 60 days after the birth (or longer, if you continue to qualify).Visit the Medicaid website to find out whether you or your child qualify for Medicaid as well as other programs offered by your state.Another program your child may qualify for is the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP provides health coverage to children in families who can't afford private health insurance but who have incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid.For more information about Medicaid and CHIP, visit InsureKidsNow.gov.WICWIC, the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children, is federally funded and run by the states. It provides food, healthcare referrals, nutrition education, and breastfeeding support to low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women and to infants and children up to age 5.To qualify, you or your child needs to meet financial eligibility requirements and be deemed at nutritional risk. To find out more about how to apply, check out the WIC prescreening tool or contact your state agency. The toll-free numbers and website links for WIC state agencies are listed on the WIC website.Ronald McDonald HousesThe Ronald McDonald Houses act as a home away from home for families so they can stay together near their hospitalized child. Families either stay at no cost or are asked to make a donation of up to $25 per day, depending on the location. (The actual cost to operate the rooms is between $50 and $100 per night.)Some NICUs also have Ronald McDonald Family Rooms for families to rest and regroup. In some Family Rooms, you can sign up to take a nap, have a shower, or drink a fresh cup of coffee while you're only a few steps away from your baby.Hospital-grade breast pumpsYou'll likely need a good pump to get  and keep  a steady milk supply for your baby. If you participate in the WIC program or Medicaid, your state agency may cover the purchase or rental of a pump. (Hospitals sometimes rent high-quality pumps.) Your private insurance may also cover the cost of a pump.Be sure to investigate your options as early as possible. There may be a time limit on requests for breast pump coverage (say, within so many weeks of your baby's birth), and you may need a prescription from your doctor in order to be eligible.Tax-deductible expensesSave all your receipts for out-of-pocket medical expenses during your child's hospital stay. You may be able to deduct them on your taxes.Free parkingNICU social workers may be able to distribute free or discounted parking passes to parents who are spending a lot of time at the NICU, which can be a big help at hospitals with scarce or expensive parking. Be sure to ask your social worker whether there's any free or discounted parking at your hospital.Show sources Hide sources HHS. 2012. Medicaid coverage of lactation services.

"Leftovers transformed: Six days, six different ways",https://www.babycenter.com/0_leftovers-transformed-six-days-six-different-ways_10381504.bc,"There's no way around it: Cooking takes time. If you love to cook, perhaps you don't mind all the chopping, simmering, and stirring to get a hot meal on the table for you and your family. But it's hard to fit it all in every day.That's why my best friend in the kitchen is my freezer. I always cook in bulk and intentionally make lots of leftovers. It's an easy way to reap more from my efforts throughout the week, or in a few months when I can savor my favorite summer soup in the middle of winter.But you probably don't want to eat the same thing every night for a week, which is why I like to make one ""base"" recipe on Sunday afternoon and use the extra during the week in a variety of ways.Tomato sauce is a great place to start. It's loaded with nutrition and has many uses beyond pasta. One big batch creates the foundation for soup, pasta, seafood, vegetables  and even the kid-friendliest of foods, pizza. Read on for ways to put your sauce to use for six days in six ways.Sunday: Tomato SauceMake tomato sauce. Here's my favorite recipe, which uses summer tomatoes fresh from the farmers market. But canned tomatoes are fine too they're often even more nutritious than fresh. Serve with your pasta of choice, ideally a whole grain variety that's better for you than white.Monday: Tomato SoupNothing beats homemade tomato soup, and many kids love it. Start with your tomato sauce base and add tomato or vegetable juice, vegetable stock, and a bit of cream (optional) for a heart-warming soup. Here's a cooking video that shows you how to make it.Tuesday: ChiliChili uses many of the same ingredients as a basic tomato sauce but adds Tex-Mex spices and flavors to give it a kick. Add a protein of choice, a few cans of beans, and other ingredients you like to make your chili your own. Tasting the final result, you'd never guess it started out as a pasta topping. Here's the how-to.Wednesday: ParmigianaA great tomato sauce is critical for a stellar parmigiana, whether eggplant, chicken, or whatever. You'll need a few extra ingredients and some cheese, but putting it together is a snap, especially if you use chicken breasts. If you want to spend a bit more time, my favorite parmigiana recipe uses a mix of grilled and roasted vegetables, which have far fewer calories than fried. In a fancier recipe, individual eggplant terrines still use the same basic sauce and are pretty enough for company. No matter which recipe you prefer, toss the extra into the freezer for a future meal, stretching Sunday's sauce even further.Thursday: Puttanesca (Or, Just Add Fish)Tomato sauce has great flavors that complement fish just as well as pasta or other proteins. Few things are simpler than roasting a piece of fish and placing it atop a bed of homemade sauce. Not sure your child will like it? Try putting the fish underneath the sauce. Accompany the dish with a green salad or vegetable and you're good to go.If you're feeling adventurous, give pasta puttanesca a try. It's a classic Italian recipe that delivers healthful omega-3 fatty acids. Start with your basic tomato sauce but add olives, capers, and canned tuna and serve with pasta or polenta. (Here's an upscale version of this dish.) If you think these flavors are too big for your child, try using just the tuna.Friday: PizzaFriday is pizza night in lots of homes. If you want to be technical about it, pizza sauce is actually not the same thing as pasta sauce. (Pizza sauce is even quicker and easier to make. Here's a recipe for pizza sauce.) However, no one will know or care if you continue putting Sunday's classic tomato sauce to use.Buy good quality pizza dough (or make your own if you're up for it), add sauce, cheese, and toppings, and you've got dinner in about 20 minutes. One of my favorite pizza recipes is for pizza margherita. But whatever kind you like, I encourage you to use a whole grain crust. It may be an adjustment at first, but over time you'll appreciate the taste and so will your child.P. K. Newby, ScD, MPH, M.S., is a nutrition scientist, food writer, and BabyCenter expert.

Healthy foods on the go (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_healthy-foods-on-the-go-ages-5-to-8_1436238.bc,"Kids take in their daily nutrition from snacks as well as meals. That's why it's a good idea to take along healthy snacks when you're on the go.Variety is the key to good nutrition, so offer your child a range of healthy options. Let your child choose and he'll be more likely to eat what you give him.Consider these nutritious foods to grab and go:Fresh fruit. Fruit is easy to pack and carry, and it also has lots of vitamins and fiber to boost your child's energy and stave off hunger.Bananas and apricots are high in potassium and help regulate blood pressure. Oranges and kiwis are high in vitamin C and help with growth.Papaya, strawberries, and cantaloupe are good sources of folate, which helps produce red blood cells. Apples are sweet, filling, and high in fiber, which reduces cholesterol and prevents constipation.Trail mix. Varied textures and flavors make this snack fun to eat. Be sure to choose items that are easy to eat with your fingers.Tailor the blend to your child's tastes.Combine whole grain cereals and pretzels for fiber, chopped or slivered nuts for protein, and chopped dried fruits for vitamins and energy. If your child likes chocolate, add a little dark chocolate, which has antioxidants.Flavored popcorn. Popcorn is a satisfying whole grain snack that's packed with fiber and polyphenols. Polyphenols are good for the heart and may help prevent cancer and other diseases, including diabetes.For a light version, air pop your popcorn or make your own on the stove top. Either way is as easy as microwaving and puts you in charge of flavor and nutrition. Store popcorn in a resealable bag.Quick stove top recipe: Pour 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large, deep saucepan (a stock pot works well) over medium heat. Add 3 corn kernels and cover. When the kernels pop, add 1/2 cup of kernels and cover the pot. Cook, shaking the pan occasionally, until the popping stops  it should take less than 5 minutes. Remove the pan from the heat, uncover it, then drizzle popped corn with a little butter or olive oil and whatever seasonings you like. Some good flavors to try: grated Parmesan cheese, smoked paprika, nutritional yeast, a little garlic salt, cinnamon, five-spice powder, chili powder, dried herbs, or salt. (A light spritz of water first helps seasonings stick.) Peanut butter fruit spirals. Combine chopped dates, raisins, or bananas with reduced fat peanut butter (about 1/4 cup peanut butter and 1/4 cup fruit).First, spread the peanut butter mixture over two 8-inch tortillas or whole wheat wraps and arrange the fruit on top. Sprinkle each tortilla or wrap with a heaping tablespoon of honey-crunch wheat germ and a pinch of ground cinnamon. Roll up the tortillas or wraps and slice each roll into about 6 pieces.Makes 3 servings (about 4 pieces each).Muffins. Add a few tablespoons of wheat germ or a handful of oats to any batter to increase the fiber content. Add chopped nuts for protein and other nutrients. Package carrot or fruit muffins in individual plastic bags.Granola bars. Check the label carefully and avoid unwanted sugar and fat. They're also easy to make on your own, just search online for ""healthy granola bar recipes."" Make a batch on the weekend and you'll have a supply that will last you all week.Rice cakes. Try spreading two mini apple-cinnamon rice cakes with a little peanut butter and putting a banana slice or raisins between them for a mini-sandwich.String cheese or cubed cheese. If you have a cooler or won't be away long, cheese provides calcium and protein. Add some whole grain crackers and thinly sliced apple for a satisfying mini-meal.Raisins. Sweetness, fiber, iron, and quick energy in each handful. What more could you want? Single-serving boxes are easy to pack.(If you're going to be out for a while, and you'll be near a restroom where your child can brush afterward, take along a travel toothbrush and toothpaste to get that sticky raisin residue off your child's teeth.)Raw veggies such as baby carrots or edamame. Serve them solo or with a yogurt dip or hummus. Package in a plastic container with separate compartments for the veggies and dip. Store in a cooler or an insulated bag with an ice pack.Cups of applesauce or fruit. Applesauce comes in different flavors and blends for a satisfying low-fat source of fiber that tastes pleasantly sweet.Prepackaged cups of fruit  like berries, peaches, grapefruit, and pineapple  are packed with vitamin C. Look for brands with no sugar added.Something to drink. A reusable bottle of tap water is your best choice. You can also buy milk in small, individual cartons that don't need refrigeration. If you want to give your child juice, choose a brand without added sugar and limit it to no more than three-quarters of a cup daily.For more healthy big-kids snacks, see BabyCenter's list of quick and healthy snacks for kids.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Nestlé Nido Partners with Babycenter for Brand’s First-Ever Digital Campaign Targeted to Bicultural Hispanic Moms in the U.S.,https://www.babycenter.com/0_nestl-233-nido-partners-with-babycenter-for-brand-8217-s-fir_10407708.bc,"BabyCenter Media Contacts:Laura Goldberg  lauragoldberg@gmail.comLaurie Jakobsen  laurie@jaybirdcom.com Marketing Program Also Extends Into BabyCenter Hispanic Site to Reach Primarily Spanish-Speaking Latina Moms in the United States(San Francisco, CA)  September 1, 2015  BabyCenter, the #1 pregnancy and parenting web and mobile destination worldwide, and Nestl NIDO, the popular early childhood powdered milk brand, are working together to introduce the nutritional drink product to bicultural Hispanic moms in the United States on the U.S. site (www.babycenter.com). In tandem, NIDO is being promoted on BabyCenter Espanol (www.espanol.babycenter.com) to reach its longtime core audience of primarily Spanish-speaking Latina moms in the U.S.Today marks the launch of two key elements of the program:Sponsorship of a special Hispanic Families Resource Center on BabyCenter U.S., showcasing editorial content that focuses on a range of Hispanic parenting concerns, from a portrait of a bicultural marriage to myths about raising a bilingual child.A Blog de BabyCenter series of sponsored posts on BabyCenter Espanol about picky eating during early childhood, featuring well-known Latina bloggers such as Mayra Elisa Buitrn of Te Cuento un Pokis, Danielly Lara de Acevedo of Un Dulce Hogar, and Victoria Infante of SerMamLatina.com, as well as NIDOs own nutritional expert Emily Dauer, MS, RD.Other aspects of the digital campaign began to roll out earlier, including sponsorship of both the BabyCenter U.S. and Hispanic desktop and mobile sites Toddler Feeding and Concerns Resource Center, native advertising, email promotions targeted to moms of toddler-age children, and pre-roll advertising across BabyCenters video library.As the Hispanic population grows in the U.S., a new generation of Latina moms is emerging, said Priscila Stanton, Marketing Manager, Nestl NIDO. Our nutritional milk drink has long been embraced by Hispanic mothers the world over, but we recognize that this new bicultural Latina American mom might need to be introduced to the health benefits that come with feeding your young one NIDO. BabyCenter has been a driving force in helping parents navigate through the stages of their childs development, and we are confident that their trusted voice will help not only increase our brand awareness among our core audience, but expand it to a new, dynamic set of Hispanic moms.While the digital world is important for all moms in the coveted millennial age group, our research has shown that it is particularly so for those who are Hispanic, said Julie Michaelson, Head of Global Sales, BabyCenter. Acculturated Latina millennial moms in the U.S. and their Spanish-preferred counterparts are more likely than the average mom to notice ads on desktop and mobile screens. That fact, combined with our strong audience of mothers with toddler-age children, makes BabyCenters U.S. and Hispanic sites an ideal environment for NIDO to reach Latina moms at the right place and time.The partnership between Nestl NIDO and BabyCenter was initiated by the brands media agency, Metavision.The partnership between NIDO and BabyCenter evolved very naturally, said Leyda M. Reyes-Rodriguez, Partner, Multicultural Director, Metavision. For years, BabyCenter has been an authority on parenting, and their credibility will give NIDO the right platform in which to connect with todays Hispanic mom who is balancing a cultural duality. BabyCenter is one of the few digital environments where you can actually do that, with their ability to reach Hispanic moms in both English and Spanish. This allows NIDO the flexibility to continue speaking to its core Spanish-speaking consumer, while attracting a new audience of bicultural moms.About BabyCenter LLCBabyCenter is the world's partner in parenting.

What eating for two really means,https://www.babycenter.com/eating-for-two,"Can I really eat twice as much now that I'm pregnant?No. You may sometimes be tempted to eat twice as much, but that's not what the doctor ordered.Your body becomes more efficient during pregnancy and is able to absorb more of the nutrients you eat. So consuming twice as much doesn't double your chances of having a healthy baby  instead, it's likely to mean excessive weight gain for you, which can put you at risk for pregnancy complications.While guidelines vary, the Institute of Medicine says if you're a healthy weight, you need no additional calories in the first trimester, 340 extra calories a day in the second trimester, and about 450 extra calories a day in the third trimester. If you're overweight or underweight, you'll need more or less than this depending on your weight gain goal.It takes only a couple of glasses of low-fat milk and a handful of sunflower seeds or a tuna sandwich to add enough calories for that last trimester. (But you'll need to eat more if you're having more than one baby.)Pregnancy Safety QuestionsOur experts answer your most pressing questions about what is and isn't safe during pregnancy.How can I get all the nutrients I need without eating a lot more calories?Here are some tips for maximizing nutrition during pregnancy:Plan meals and snacks based on the requirements outlined in the USDA Choose My Plate site for pregnant woman or another reliable source, like the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate. Learn more about meal planning for pregnancy.To meet your daily needs for protein, calories, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and key vitamins and minerals during pregnancy, eat a variety of foods. Even within a category of foods (like vegetables), look for different colors, types, and textures, for example.Try to minimize ""extra"" foods that have calories but few nutrients  sugary beverages, fried foods, foods with extra fat and sugar. Instead, choose meals and snacks that pack the most nutrition per calorie. Adding a few nutrition-packed snacks  like yogurt, nuts, a hard-boiled egg, some fresh fruits or vegetables  to your daily intake is a great way to get the healthy calories your baby needs.Choose foods that are as close to their natural state as possible. Pick whole-grain bread or brown rice over refined white bread or white rice, and fresh fruits or frozen unsweetened fruit over canned fruits in sugar syrup, for example.Eat fats, oils, and sweets sparingly. And be sure to choose healthy fats. Can't overcome your cravings for junk food? Discover some healthy  and delicious  alternatives.How is the food I eat divided between my needs and my baby's?Doctors don't understand exactly how you and your growing baby divvy up nutrients. Sustenance for your child comes from your diet and from the nutrients already stored in your bones and tissues.In the past, a developing fetus was thought of as a ""perfect parasite,"" taking all the necessary nourishment from the mother, regardless of her diet. This myth maintained that if your diet was deficient in, say, vitamin C, it didn't matter as far as the baby was concerned, because he could simply siphon the nutrient from you.Experts now believe that it's the growing baby who suffers if the mother's diet is lacking. Inadequate nutrition during pregnancy is thought to have lifelong effects on a baby's health.In a nutshell: Your baby's health and growth are directly related to what you eat before and during your pregnancy.What you eat is important. And when you're tempted to overdo it, remember that you're eating for a baby, not another full-size adult. Choose quality over quantity!Show sources Hide sources IOM. 2009.

How to get your grade-schooler to eat more healthy food,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-get-your-grade-schooler-to-eat-more-healthy-food_1383895.bc,"Eating well gives your child the energy he needs to learn and grow. And it'll help him stay healthy, maintain a healthy weight, and establish good lifelong eating habits. Here are some ways to make nutritious food the most appealing choice:Get your grade-schooler involvedA great way to get your child excited about eating a range of healthy foods is to involve him in the family's meal-planning decisions. Let him help you make out menus and a grocery list. Have him check to see whether you're out of grapes and suggest favorite suppers and what to pack for his lunchbox.When you take him food shopping, ask him to check items off the grocery list for you as you shop. Give him a few choices to make along the way: Peaches or mangoes? Peas or carrots? Graham crackers or fig bars?You can even have your child look for specific ingredients, like sugar, on the nutrition labels of the foods you choose  and those you put back on the shelf.Make a habit of selecting one new fruit or vegetable to try each week, keeping in mind that your child may not be interested in trying something unfamiliar until it's been offered numerous times.To encourage your child to take some responsibility for his own nutrition, you could help him create his own daily food chart, with boxes for each category: fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy, and meat/protein. (Check out the United States Department of Agriculture's ready-made chart to get started.)Have your child color in or check off the appropriate boxes when he finishes a meal or snack. Then look at the chart together at the end of each day to tally how well he did in meeting his nutritional goals.Encourage involvement in the kitchenTeach your grade-schooler to follow a simple recipe and measure ingredients. (This is excellent hands-on practice for learning fractions!)Have your child wash the lettuce and toss the salad, grease the baking pans and fill the muffin tins. Let him have some fun pouring pancakes in the shape of his initials or cutting toast into a heart shape.Once he's old enough to handle it, have him grate cheese and even chop fruits and vegetables. (Always supervise your child with knives and electric appliances, of course.) Go to the sourceTake your grade-schooler on an outing to an orchard, berry farm, or dairy so he can see where the food on his plate comes from. The novelty just might inspire him to try something he wouldn't otherwise be interested in.There's nothing like seeing your own food grow to motivate kids to eat their fruits and veggies. Think about planting your own. Even if you don't have much space, you can grow tomatoes or strawberries in a container on a balcony or patio.Be picky about juicesFruit juices count toward your child's daily fruit intake, but be careful about the kind and amount of juice you offer. Serve your grade-schooler only 100 percent fruit juice or fruit-vegetable juice combinations. (These are full of nutrients and contain less natural sugar than many fruit juices.) Some kids even enjoy vegetable juices straight up!If your child won't drink milk, you may want to find juices that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D, but don't offer fruit ""drinks"" because they may contain as little as 10 percent juice and an array of flavorings and sweeteners.Keep in mind that even the healthiest fruit juices can easily become too much of a good thing. Juice can contribute to childhood obesity and malnourishment because a child who drinks a great deal of juice gets extra calories and, at the same time, not all the nutrients he needs. Constantly sipping juice can also lead to tooth decay.So limit your child to 4 to 6 ounces of fruit juice per day through age 6, and keep it under 8 to 12 ounces per day starting at age 7. Then use fresh fruit to meet the rest of his daily requirement. When he's thirsty, encourage him to drink water. (You can also water down your child's juice, half and half, for the flavor of juice with fewer extra calories.)Shake and bakeSmoothies are an easy way to get fruit and other nutritious foods into your child's diet. All you need is a blender and a few simple ingredients. You can use your choice of fresh fruit, frozen fruit such as berries or bananas (peel before freezing), or even canned pineapple or peaches (strain the syrup first).You might want to include tofu or hard-cooked egg whites  they add protein without changing the taste or texture  and a bit of ground flax seed for extra fiber and omega 3s. Blend with fruit juice or add milk, yogurt, or frozen yogurt for a creamier drink and a dose of calcium.Whole wheat and bran muffins and quick breads are a good source of grains and fiber, and they can also be a vehicle for fruits and vegetables. Make or buy them with bananas, blueberries, carrots, pineapple, or zucchini. Fortify but don't foolYou might try incorporating healthy foods into dishes you know your grade-schooler likes, but don't be sneaky about it. (Even if he falls for it now, he may later feel betrayed when he figures out what's up.)Tell him that you're giving him some special pasta spirals tonight  with spinach mixed in or with broccoli and cheese on top. Better to be up-front and encourage an adventurous approach to eating.Make it countBe aware of your grade-schooler's nutritional needs, but remember that eating right isn't all about fruits and vegetables. Calcium is especially important during adolescence, when bones are growing rapidly. Three servings of calcium-rich foods per day are needed. Here are some easy ways to serve up good nutrition:A peanut butter sandwich (1 1/2 tablespoons on two slices of whole wheat bread) and one cup of low-fat milk will take care of about a third of your child's recommended daily intake of grain and half of his dairy requirements. It will also provide all of his protein for the day, as well as important nutrients like zinc, vitamin E, magnesium, and essential fatty acids.One and a half cups of bran cereal with raisins with one cup of low-fat milk and a 4-ounce glass of orange juice will satisfy about a third of his fruit, half of his dairy, and a third of his grains for the day. It'll also provide fiber, iron, calcium, and vitamin C.Even a slice of cheese pizza equals almost a third of the day's dairy, providing over half of the day's protein and healthy doses of vitamin A, zinc, and iron.Find fast-food alternativesMost fast food is full of fat, sugar, salt, and excess calories. An occasional fast-food burger and fries won't cause any harm, but if you have an alternative, take it. Teach your child to select from the healthy options on the menu  yes to the grilled chicken sandwich, no to the fried onion rings, and forget about super-sizing the meal!Or pick and choose: Have the burger, but choose fruit or low-fat granola instead of fries. Do your best to limit these kinds of meals to no more than once a week.Be a good role modelAs you consider all the ways of getting your grade-schooler to eat well, remember to practice what you preach. If your child sees you eating lots of junk food or skipping meals, you can't expect him to eat properly. Make an effort to eat whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and you and your child will both be better off.Be upbeatForget the food fights. Let your child decide how much he wants to eat. And don't use a sweet treat as a bribe or withhold it as a punishment.Try to make mealtime together  at the table, not in front of the television  as enjoyable as possible, so that your child can establish a good, healthy relationship with food.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2001.

Baby food revolution: New rules for feeding your baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-food-revolution-new-rules-for-feeding-your-baby_10320504.bc,"Many babies areready for solid foodsby the time they're 4 to 6 months old, and parents often turn to such traditional first foods as infant cereals and otherbland fare. Plain food isn't necessarily bad for babies, but too much of it can deprive them of important nutrients and may make them less likely to accept different textures and flavors.So how do you get your baby to eat a variety of food from an early age? Here's the exciting new thinking on what to feed your baby.Rethink what you've heard about food allergiesExperts used to recommend waiting to introducecommonly allergenic foods, including eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, and shellfish, until after your baby's first birthday. But recent research suggests that introducing them when your baby is between 4 and 6 months old may actually help prevent food allergies.If your baby is at least 4 months old and shows signs of readiness for solids, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology recommends starting with a few nonallergenic foods  such as pureed veggies, fruits, meats, or infant cereal  to see if they cause any reactions. If they don't, you can move on to more allergenic foods, such as eggs and fish. Be sure to wait three to five days before introducing the next new food.7 signs your baby is ready for solid foods Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:57Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:57Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Watch for these signs that usually indicate when babies are ready to try their first food. See all videosYou may also need to take extra precautions in some situations. If your baby has a sibling or a parent with an allergic condition (including hay fever, eczema, allergic asthma, or food allergy), he's more likely to have a food allergy. In this case, consult with your baby's doctor or an allergist before starting solids.Also check with the doctor before starting solids or introducing new foods if your baby has any of these risk factors:A sibling with a peanut allergyModerate to severe eczema despite following a doctor's treatment planA diagnosed food allergy or a previous immediate allergic reaction to a foodA positive result on an allergy blood test for a food that your baby has not yet tried (Blood tests for food allergies are usually done only for children with a history of an allergic reaction.)Read our article on food allergies to find out more.No need to avoid spices and seasoningsWhile babies throughout the world are dining on complex, flavorful cuisine, many babies in the United States are gumming plain, tasteless mush. The reasons we continue to serve babies bland food are open to debate, but one thing is certain  they're not based on research.""The idea that babies should eat only bland food is a myth that has somehow become our cultural norm,"" says Seattle pediatrician Susanna Block. ""There's absolutely no science behind it.""In other words, a culinary walk on the wild side won't hurt your baby in the slightest.5 tips to develop healthy eating habits Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:05Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:05Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosAnd breastfed babies have actually walked that way already: Breast milk takes on the flavors of the food the mother eats, Block explains. So if you dine at your favorite Indian restaurant and then nurse, your baby will also enjoy the taste of an Indian meal. ""To go from diverse, flavorful breast milk to bland, processed foods seems like a step backward,"" she says.So toss some rosemary in with that squash, liven up that chicken with a dash of cumin, and give those mashed potatoes a kick with a blend of paprika and parsley. You may be surprised by your baby's reaction.Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to banish hot spices from the highchair tray either. ""I know of no evidence that spicy food has a negative impact on babies. The degree of spiciness is a cultural thing,"" says pediatrician Frank Greer of the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Of course you'll want to steer clear of anything that could irritate your baby's skin or mouth (so no habaneros yet), but there's no harm in letting your baby try mildly or moderately spicy food. For example, milder chiles, such as Anaheims and poblanos, add flavor without causing pain. If anyone raises an eyebrow, just say that babies in other parts of the world thrive on spicy food.""Spicy chickpea curry with lots of ginger was one of my son's favorite finger foods,"" says Jennifer Pinarski of Winnipeg, Manitoba.Cooking with herbs and spices is a great way to expand your baby's palate, but skip the sugar and salt when preparing food for your little one. Not only are they unhealthy for her, but they can also lead to poor eating habits and health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease in childhood and later in life.Give your little one homemade food for babies and for grown-ups""Homemade baby food"" sounds daunting, but it's surprisingly easy and doesn't require a nutrition degree, gourmet cooking skills, or fancy equipment. Making baby food can be as simple as mashing up a banana or avocado with a fork, squashing canned beans together with some garlic, or pureeing veggies steamed with spices.And as long as you're making something healthy, your baby can eat the same food you do  no need to make separate meals! Just use a blender, food processor, or hand grinder to make food the right consistency for your baby.Make your own informed decisions about organics""There's a lot of confusion when it comes to organics because there's no conclusive evidence that they're healthier than conventional foods,"" says dietitian and mom Jodi Greebel of New York. And there's conflicting evidence about whether pesticides andhormonesin conventional foods are harmful.""But the general feeling is that anything harmful will have a stronger effect on babies because of their small size  bad substances won't be as diluted as they are in an adult.""Some studies suggest a link between pesticide exposure and cancer as well as developmental problems in children, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and poor intellectual development. But the short-term and long-term effects of pesticide exposure are still poorly understood, and experts disagree on just how concerned parents should be. In deciding whether to feed your baby all, some, or no organic food, consider what works for your family andyourbudget.The organic factor also matters more with some foods than others. For example, apples, spinach, and strawberries have the highest pesticide residue levels. On the other hand, sweet corn, cabbage, and avocados tend to have relatively low levels. The nonprofitEnvironmental Working Groupranks 48 fruits and vegetables from best to worst in terms of pesticide residue.Greebel and Block also recommend buying organic meat and poultry when possible.""Both come from animals that were not treated with antibiotics."" says Greebel.Keep in mind that conventional meat and poultry can still be free of antibiotics and hormones. The federal government prohibits the use of hormones when raising hogs and poultry, so just check packages of beef for a label like ""no hormones administered,"" and check meat and poultry products for labels indicating that no antibiotics were added. Visit the United States Department of Agriculture's website for more information about meat and poultry labeling terms.Whatever you decide, remember that general good nutrition trumps organics. ""The most important thing is to provide your baby with a wide variety of healthy foods,"" says Greebel.Expand your baby's tastesAlthough consistency in everything from bedtime to discipline is a hallmark of sound parenting advice, a little inconsistency at mealtime can be a wonderful thing. Changing up the menu broadens your baby's palate and helps to ensure good nutrition, especially when it comes to produce. (For ideas to get you started, check out these experts' suggestions foradventurous first foods.)Often this means heaving ourselves out of a well-worn food rut. Stuck on sweet potatoes? Shake things up with some steamed beets. Smashed peas and carrots every night? Consider pureed brussels sprouts instead. Oat cereal overload? Try quinoa.""I gave my baby quinoa cooked in vegetable broth,"" says dietitian Karin Hosenfeld of North Dallas Nutrition. ""It's loaded with heart healthy protein.""Or instead of chicken, chicken, and more chicken, consider serving your baby pureed duck leg. ""It's easy to cook and tastes great,"" says food writer Matthew Amster-Burton.Find out which rules for feeding solids still applyIdeas about what to feed your baby may be changing, but many recommendations for introducing solids and encouraging your baby to eat well still stand.

12 worst foods for pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_12-worst-foods-for-pregnancy_10395224.bc,"Find out which foods you'll definitely want to avoid to keep you and your baby safe and healthy, from high-sodium snacks to non-dairy creamer.Here's a handy guide to the 12 worst pregnancy foods. And for positive encouragement, check out our 10 best foods for pregnancy and tips on eating well, too.1. High-mercury seafoodHere are the four to avoid: shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish.The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) advise pregnant women, those who may become pregnant, and those who are breastfeeding to abstain from these fish completely due to their high levels of mercury. Mercury can impair a baby's developing brain and nervous system.Other experts are more cautious, offering a longer list of fish to avoid. And the FDA cautions that pregnant women should eat no more than 6 ounces a week of canned ""solid white"" or albacore tuna due to mercury risks.However, there are plenty of types of seafood with low levels of mercury that should be included in your pregnancy diet. The fatty acids in seafood (DHA and EPA, both forms of omega-3) play a key role in baby brain development.In fact, the FDA and EPA recommend that pregnant women eat up to 12 ounces of low-mercury fish and shellfish a week. Find out more about which fish  and how much of it  is safe during pregnancy.2. Unpasteurized (raw) milk and juicesWhile there are plenty of people who tout the benefits of raw milk and raw juices, there are serious health risks to drinking these during pregnancy. The main concern is listeriosis, a bacterial infection that can be very dangerous to your baby. You're especially at risk during pregnancy because your immune system is suppressed.The bacterium Listeria monocytogenes can lurk in unpasteurized milk and dairy products, unpasteurized juice, and other foods, and it can continue to grow, even in the refrigerator. That's why it's best to avoid these beverages completely.3. Refrigerated meats and deli salads (unless steaming hot)Listeria contamination is also a threat with refrigerated deli meats like turkey, ham, bologna, roast beef, and hot dogs. These aren't safe unless you heat them to steaming hot (165 degrees Fahrenheit) before you eat them.Same goes for refrigerated smoked seafood, meat spreads, and deli salads such as coleslaw, potato salad, ham salad, and seafood salad. Unless you don't mind eating these steaming hot, you'll want to avoid them. (Smoked seafood, like lox and whitefish, is fine if it's in a casserole or quiche that has been cooked to 165 degrees F.)Canned, shelf-stable meats and seafood are safe to eat, but these products contain high amounts of sodium, so they're not the best nutritional choice during pregnancy.4. Raw or undercooked meat, poultry, fish, shellfish, and eggsThe main risks in eating raw and undercooked food are the bacteria Salmonella and the parasite Toxoplasma, both of which can infect your unborn baby and cause serious health problems.To eliminate the risk, use a food thermometer and cook beef, veal, pork, and lamb to 145 degrees F. Make sure all ground meats reach 160 degrees F, and poultry reaches 165 degrees F. Cook eggs until the yolks are firm, and make sure dishes containing eggs  such as frittatas, stratas, quiche, and bread pudding  reach 160 degrees F.Avoid sauces made with raw eggs, which can include homemade Caesar salad dressing, barnaise and hollandaise sauces, and mayonnaise. If you're making food that calls for raw eggs and won't be cooked, like a sauce or spread, use a pasteurized egg product. And if you're making cookie dough or cake batter with raw eggs, resist the urge to lick the spoon or eat the uncooked goods.When dining out, order your meat well done, your eggs and seafood fully cooked through, and avoid the sauces and dressings listed above.5. Raw sprouts and unwashed raw produceRaw sprouts seem like a health ""do,"" but during pregnancy they're definitely a ""don't."" Before the sprouts are even grown, bacteria can get into the sprout seeds through cracks in the shell. And since sprouts generally aren't cooked before eating, there's no way to kill the bacteria. So avoid raw alfalfa, clover, radish, and mung bean sprouts, which can be found in some sandwiches and salads.Toxoplasma is also a concern in unwashed fruits and vegetables. Make sure to rinse produce thoroughly under running water before using it. And avoid eating bruised fruit or vegetables, as bacteria can thrive in areas where the produce has been damaged.6. Unpasteurized cheeseLike raw milk, unpasteurized soft cheese carries the risk of Listeria contamination. The cheeses that are typically of concern include feta, Brie, Camembert, fresh mozzarella, blue cheese like gorgonzola, Limburger, queso blanco, and queso fresco.As long as the label says that the cheese is pasteurized, it's safe to eat. In restaurants, ask if the cheeses listed are pasteurized. If they don't know, it's smart to skip it.7. Energy drinks and excessive coffeeUp to 200 milligrams a day of caffeine is considered safe during pregnancy. That amounts to about 12 ounces of drip coffee, which sounds like a lot until you consider your consumption throughout the day. The stimulant can lurk in many other drinks and some foods, pushing you over the maximum. For guidance, see a list of how much caffeine is in common foods and beverages.Skip the energy drinks during pregnancy. While some contain less caffeine overall than a cup of coffee, they've been linked to increased blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythms.And avoid drinks with ""natural"" energy boosters such as guarana, ginseng, yerba mate, and green tea extract, all of which are stimulants that have not been proven safe to use during pregnancy. 8. Unripe papayaUnripe (green) papaya contains a latex substance that can trigger uterine contractions. The latex found in unripe papaya acts like the hormones oxytocin and prostaglandin, which are involved in the start of labor. So it's wise to avoid unripe papaya, which is often found on menus in Thai restaurants.9. Foods with trans fatsEven though the health dangers of trans fats have been known since the early 1990s, they weren't called out on nutrition labels until 2006. Many consumers assume they're not being used anymore, but some products still include this unhealthy fat. (Learn more about ""good"" and ""bad"" fats in your pregnancy diet.)Trans fat is a concern because it not only increases LDL cholesterol, it also lowers levels of heart-protective HDL cholesterol. And studies have linked trans fats to higher rates of endometriosis and infertility. There's even some evidence linking trans fats to lower birth weights and a higher risk of having a small for gestational age (SGA) baby.So which products do you still need to watch out for?Fried foods: While most fast food chains switched to oils that are not hydrogenated, some still use partially hydrogenated (and trans fat producing) oils to fry foods like hash browns, mozzarella sticks, and French fries. While you can always ask what type of oil your local restaurant uses, it's smart to limit your intake of high-calorie (and often high-sodium) fried foods anyway.Margarine, frosting, and non-dairy creamer: Several companies have eliminated trans fat from their soft spreads, but some include it, so be sure to check the nutrition facts. Also, since companies technically don't need to list trans fat if the product contains less than 1 g per serving, it's possible that your creamer or margarine may still contain some even if it's not listed. Be sure to scan the ingredient list for ""partially hydrogenated"" oils.Biscuit and pancake mixes: Trans fat in your waffle mix? Yup. Companies include it to give the product a light, fluffy texture. Again, be sure to check the nutrition facts to make sure you see a big fat zero listed for trans fat, and check the ingredient list for ""partially hydrogenated"" oils.10. Foods with sneaky sugarsCookies, cakes, candy, and ice cream obviously have lots of sugar, but the sweet stuff can also lurk in some unlikely places. Not only is added sugar contributing to the obesity and diabetes epidemics, it doesn't provide any nutritional benefits. And if you're predisposed to gestational diabetes (which is on the rise), your body may not be able to produce enough insulin to handle all the extra sugar in your blood.Americans consume a whopping 22 teaspoons (or 88 grams) of added sugar each day. We're not talking about naturally occurring sugars in fruit and dairy products, but the sugars and syrups that are added to food products to make them taste better.Here's where added sugar might be hiding:Bread and rolls: Look out for molasses, high fructose corn syrup, and other sweeteners in these bakery items. While the total grams of sugar are probably no more than 5 g, wouldn't you rather spend your sugars on something like a bowl of ice cream?Frozen meals: Frozen pizzas, diet meals, and especially Asian-inspired convenience meals can pack up to 20 g of sugar per serving. If a meal has more than 10 g of sugar per serving, skip it.Salad dressing: There's nothing wrong with dressing up your salad to make it tastier, but take a good look at what you're pouring on top of your healthy greens. Some bottled dressings rack up 8 g of sugar per 2 tablespoons. The fat-free varieties can be the worst because they replace the fat with sugar or corn syrup to make the dressing taste good.Snacks (crackers, popcorn, snack bars, etc.): Even products that don't taste particularly sweet may be packed with sugar. Cereal bars can be major offenders, especially if they have a jam-like filling. And graham crackers can contain a gram of sugar per cracker.Cereal: You know you should avoid frosted kids' cereals and the like, but even some grown-up, whole-grain cereals have 14 to 16 g of sugar per serving, which is about half of what you're supposed to get in a day! Always look at the ingredient list and if the first ingredient listed is sugar, put the box back on the shelf.11. Soda and sweetened beveragesIt's not just the caffeine that puts cola and other sodas on the no-no list for pregnancy, it's also the high level of processed sugar in each can. A 12-ounce can of cola contains 27 g of added sugar. That's nearly 7 teaspoons. And other bottled beverages aren't much better. Sweetened iced tea, juice drinks, lemonade  they all have between 20 and 35 g of sugar per bottle, and don't provide many nutritional perks. So quench your thirst with water, milk, and pure (100-percent) fruit or vegetable juice. And if water is getting boring, make your own ""spa"" water by adding a few (washed) sprigs of rosemary and some cucumber and lemon slices to a pitcher of water  very refreshing!12. High-sodium foodsWhile we often crave salty foods when we're expecting (especially during the first trimester), sodium is not a pregnant woman's friend. Pregnancy already makes you prone to swelling and water retention, and too much sodium only makes those conditions worse. In addition to avoiding processed and fast food, look out for these sodium culprits and keep sodium to 2,300 mg per day.Frozen meals: Salt is a natural preservative, so these meals are usually packed with sodium. Some of them reach nearly 1,000 mg  yikes! There are definitely healthier options out there these days, so be sure to scan the package and look for meals with less than 500 mg sodium.Bread and rolls: Bread doesn't usually taste salty, but salt is almost always added to provide flavor. One roll can top more than 400 mg of sodium, and cheese rolls can have over 800 mg.Shelf-stable lunches and snacks: Usually made up of crackers, processed meat, cheese, and a fruit cup, these products are loaded with sodium (over 800 mg), nitrates, and sugar. You're much better off bringing your own snacks or sandwiches when you're at work or on the go.Soup: Canned soup is a known offender, often containing 900 mg of sodium per serving (even more per can). But also watch out for soups at national chain restaurants, which can have just as much. And packaged ramen noodles have tons of salt and fat.Bottom line: Stick to fresh, unprocessed foods as much as possible and you'll go a long way toward cutting down on excess sugar, sodium, and other bad stuff.

How to buy baby formula,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-buy-baby-formula_1334669.bc,"I'm bottle-feeding my baby. Which formula is best?It's easy to feel overwhelmed in the formula aisle. Choosing the right nourishment for your baby is a pretty weighty decision, and there are lots of options.When choosing formula, consider the form it comes in, the type of protein and carbohydrate it provides, and what other ingredients are included. In the end, you'll be able to choose the formula that is best for your baby and your family's lifestyle.What are the different forms of formula?Formulas come in three forms: Ready-to-use, liquid concentrate, and powdered.Ready-to-use formula is undoubtedly the most convenient  no mixing or measuring required, just open and serve. It's the kind of formula that hospitals often give to newborns. It's hygienic and especially helpful when you don't know whether you'll have access to safe water.The convenience of ready-to-use formula comes at a price  this kind costs about 20 percent more per ounce than powdered formula. The containers also take up more storage space in your cupboard and more space in the landfill (unless you can recycle the containers).Once opened, ready-to-use formula has a short lifespan  it must be used within 48 hours. Also, because liquid formula is often darker than powdered formula, many moms complain that it's more likely to stain clothes.Liquid concentrate formula requires mixing equal parts of water and formula. Compared to ready-to-use formula, concentrate is less expensive and takes up less storage space. Compared to powdered formula, it's a little easier to prepare but more expensive.Powdered formula is the most economical and the most environmentally friendly formula option. It takes up the least amount of space in transport, in your pantry, and in your trash can.Powdered formula takes more time to prepare than other types of formula, and you must follow the directions exactly, but it has a one-month shelf life after the container has been opened. As with liquid concentrate formula, you can mix up just the right amount  as much or as little as you want  whenever you need it. This is especially helpful if you're a breastfeeding mom who may only need a supplemental bottle occasionally. What are the different types of formula?There's a formula to suit every baby's needs. But it's best to stick with one type and resist the urge to switch, even if your baby seems like he's not digesting the formula well at first.Common problems  like spitting up, gas, and colic  are usually unrelated to your baby's diet. Most of the time, these problems have to do with your baby's immature gastrointestinal tract, not what he's eating.So try out a particular type of formula for at least a couple weeks. After that, if your baby's still having trouble, talk to his doctor about switching.Cow's-milk-based formula: Most formula available today has cow's milk as the main ingredient. The overwhelming majority of formula-fed and formula-supplemented babies do best with this type of formula because it has just the right balance of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. The milk protein in formula is significantly altered to make it easier to digest. Your baby won't be able to digest regular cow's milk until after his first birthday.Partially and extensively hydrolyzed formulas: In these formulas, the protein is broken down into small parts (partially hydrolyzed) or even smaller parts (extensively hydrolyzed) that are easier for your baby to digest than larger protein molecules. Your baby may need a hydrolyzed formula if he has a milk protein allergy or trouble absorbing nutrients (a common problem for preemies). The doctor may also suggest trying a hydrolyzed formula if your baby has a skin condition such as eczema.Soy-based formula: These formulas are made with a plant protein that, like the protein in cow's milk, is modified for easy digestion. Although soy-based formulas are a good option for vegan families, there are only a few medical reasons for using them. These include:Transient lactose deficiency: a temporary lactose intolerance caused by a gastrointestional infectionImmunoglobulin E (IgE)-associated allergy to cow's milk: an allergy to cow's milk protein that causes immediate symptoms, including wheezing, runny nose, hives, and rashes. Many babies with IgE-associated milk allergy are also allergic to soy protein, so don't give soy formulas to your child unless your doctor recommends it.Galactosemia: a rare inherited disorder in which the body is unable to break down a milk sugar (galactose) to produce energyCongenital lactase deficiency: an extremely rare inherited disorder in which a baby is born with very little or none of the enzyme that breaks down the sugar lactose found in milk, causing life-threatening lactose intolerance symptomsLactose-free formula: A case of lactose intolerance or an inability to digest lactose  the sugar naturally found in milk  is rare. If your baby is lactose intolerant, his doctor may recommend a soy formula or another formula in which the lactose is replaced with a different sugar, such as corn syrup.Formula for premature and low-birth-weight babies: These formulas often contain more calories and protein, as well as a more easily absorbed type of fat called medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). How much MCT is in these formulas varies by brand. Your baby's doctor will help you select the one that will help your baby gain just the right amount of weight.Human milk fortifier: This product is used to enrich the nutrition of breastfed babies who have special needs. Some are designed to be mixed with breast milk, and some are meant to be fed alternately with breast milk.Metabolic formula: If your baby has a disease that requires very specific nutrition, he may need one of these specially developed formulas.Organic formula: According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), no research to date has proven organic milk to be healthier for children than regular milk. Since standard formula is based on milk, parents may want to consider whether organic formula is worth the higher price.Other specialty formula: New formulas come out all the time and are marketed to moms to help babies with digestion to relieve problems such as colic or acid reflux. These formulas have a protein ratio similar to breast milk and vary slightly in composition from regular formula  but some experts say they may not be any better.""More often than not, specialty formulas are substantially more expensive and not significantly different in key nutritional value, says KT Park, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Stanford's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. ""Babies undergo tremendous adaptation of their gastrointestinal tract during the first six months of life, which is normal. There are very few scenarios in which infants would require the more expensive formulas.""If you think your child might benefit from a specialty formula, ask your child's doctor about it before you stock up. How do formulas differ?There are five main components to formula: Carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals, plus other nutrients in smaller quantities. What makes one brand of formula different from the next are the specific carbohydrates and proteins as well as any additional ingredients. For example, casein and whey are two kinds of cow's milk proteins found in various proportions in different brands of cow's-milk-based formula.It's very easy to get confused by all of the items listed on the ingredient label. Below is a guide through the maze of ingredients and a comparison to the ones found in breast milk.Carbohydrate: Lactose is the main carbohydrate in both breast milk and formulas made from cow's-milk. Corn maltodextrin is sometimes used as a secondary source of carbohydrate in formula. Lactose-free, soy, and special formulas contain one or more of the following carbohydrates: Sucrose, corn maltodextrin, modified cornstarch, or corn syrup solids.Protein: Breast milk contains about 60 percent whey and 40 percent casein. Most formulas have similar protein content. Others contain 100 percent whey.Partially hydrolyzed formulas are not hypoallergenic  don't use one if your baby has a protein allergy, or even if you suspect she may have one. However, compared to standard cow's-milk formula, partially hydrolyzed whey formulas have been shown in studies to reduce eczema.Extensively hydrolyzed formulas contain proteins that are completely broken down into their building blocks (amino acids), which allow them to be easily absorbed. These formulas are considered hypoallergenic and are used for babies who have a protein allergy.Soy formulas contain soy protein isolate  a processed soybean ingredient that is almost pure protein (at least 90 percent). Some brands use partially hydrolyzed soy protein (protein is partially broken down) to allow easier digestion.Fat: Breast milk contains a blend of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated fat. Formulas use a variety of oils to match the fat makeup of breast milk. They include soy oil, coconut oil, palm or palm olein oil, and high oleic sunflower oil.Although palm and palm olein oil is widely used, research has shown that these fats can reduce absorption of fat and calcium. This would mean that your baby would not absorb as much fat and calcium as she would from a formula that doesn't contain this oil.Medium-chain triglycerides require less effort to digest and are more easily absorbed. They're used in special formulas for premature infants and for infants who have trouble digesting or absorbing nutrients.The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the addition of two long-chain fatty acids to formula: DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and ARA (arachidonic acid), which are now standard ingredients in formula. Both of these substances are found in breast milk when the mother's diet is adequate, and both are important for brain and vision development. Babies get DHA and ARA from their mother during the third trimester, but the transfer is cut short when a baby is born prematurely. All babies need a steady supply of both substances throughout their first year.Numerous studies support the supplementation of formula with DHA and ARA. One, a report published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed that full-term infants fed DHA- and ARA-supplemented formula had significantly clearer vision than infants who did not receive the supplements. And a study published in The Journal of Pediatrics states that DHA and ARA enhanced both cognitive and physical growth in preterm infants.There aren't any long-term studies confirming the safety of these substances, although there's no evidence suggesting that these additives are harmful to babies, either. The AAP hasn't taken a position on whether these fatty acids should be added to formula, but the organization does point out that they're believed to be important in brain and eye development.Vitamins and minerals: Most words on the ingredient label describe vitamins and minerals. These words can be hard to figure out  ferrous sulfate is iron, for example. Sodium ascorbate is vitamin C, and calcium pantothenate is vitamin B5.The AAP recommends that all healthy babies who aren't breastfed exclusively be given iron-fortified formula until their first birthday. It's important that babies receive the minimum recommended amount of iron (0.27 milligrams [mg] daily for infants 0 to 6 months; 11 mg daily for babies 7 to 12 months) to prevent iron-deficiency anemia.Iron is vital to the blood's ability to circulate oxygen, which all of the body's cells need to function properly. Studies have shown that getting enough iron in the first year of life is important for brain development. A baby's iron stores are established in the third trimester, so premature babies need extra help in getting plenty of iron.Most formulas contain at least 4 mg of iron per liter, although ""low-iron"" formulas are still on the shelves. These were developed years ago in response to the misconception that iron causes constipation. The AAP would like these low-iron formulas to be discontinued or labeled as nutritionally inadequate.Nucleotides: These are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, naturally present in breast milk. They have several functions and may aid in immune system development. Different brands of formula have different amounts of nucleotides added.Rice starch: Rice starch is added to ""anti-regurgitation"" formulas. Your doctor may recommend this type of formula to alleviate your baby's acid reflux.Dietary fiber: Soy fiber is added to soy formula for the temporary treatment of diarrhea. The only formula containing fiber is Similac Expert Care for Diarrhea, which is clinically shown to reduce the duration of diarrhea.Amino acids: Amino acids such as taurine, methionine, and carnitine are added to soy formulas, and sometimes to cow's-milk formulas, to match the amino acids in breast milk.Probiotics and prebiotics: Probiotics are a type of live bacteria that may help prevent intestinal infections and inflammation. Prebiotics boost the numbers of probiotic bacteria in the gut.The AAP says some studies show probiotics and prebiotics can play a role in keeping your child's digestive system healthy but they can also be unsafe for babies with compromised immune systems and certain other medical conditions, so it's best to check with your baby's doctor before using these formulas. Any benefit from probiotics and prebiotics goes away once your baby stops using them. Are generic brands nutritionally adequate?Generic brands of formula must meet the FDA's requirements for nutrients in formula, so in many instances, the only difference between generic and brand name is the price.Whether you're buying generic or name brand, take a minute to look at the label before you purchase the formula. Specific ingredients do vary from brand to brand, and this can make a difference to your baby.Can I make my own formula?Doctors strongly advise against it. If you made your own formula, it would be impossible to include all the ingredients in the right amounts for your baby. Homemade formula could lead to failure to gain weight, malnourishment, or even death.What about adding cereal or milk to my baby's formula?Never add any ingredients  including vitamins, cereal, fatty acids, olive oil, regular cow's milk, or anything else  to your baby's formula unless your doctor recommends it. Formula is a carefully developed substance with precise amounts of dozens of nutrients. Adding anything to formula could jeopardize your baby's health.Olive oil, for example, can lead to permanent lung damage and even death, because of the danger of inhaling the oil into the lungs when spitting up. Because cow's milk is so hard for babies to digest, never mix cow's milk with formula or give it to your baby straight until he's at least 1 year old. And adding breast milk to formula is a waste of breast milk if your baby doesn't drink the entire bottle.What if I'm still not sure which formula is right for my baby?If you've decided to feed your baby formula and you're still baffled by the many options available, or you're considering switching formulas, talk with your baby's doctor. He'll consider your baby's health, age, and nutritional needs and make an appropriate recommendation.He can also monitor your baby's reactions and investigate any symptoms. Don't try to diagnose an allergy or sensitivity on your own. You could miss a serious underlying condition or prevent your baby from getting adequate nutrition.If you'd like to learn more, visit the FDA pages on infant formula.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Food cravings and what they mean,https://www.babycenter.com/0_food-cravings-and-what-they-mean_1313971.bc,"What do pregnant women crave? We surveyed BabyCenter moms, and almost 40 percent said, ""Give me something sweet."" Slightly fewer (33 percent) chose salty snacks. Fans of Mexican food and other spicy cuisine came in third (17 percent). Trailing (at 10 percent) were those who craved citrus fruit, green apples, and other lip-puckering tart or sour foods.What does it all mean? Here's what the experts say:Food jags: Cheez Whiz sandwiches, anyone?About half of women in the United States report at least one food craving during pregnancy, says Judith Brown, author ofWhat to Eat Before, During, and After Pregnancy. And those cravings aren't all for pickles and ice cream.

See all pregnancy videosMany of these cravings seem to come out of nowhere, and they can feel overpowering. What causes them? Hormones, right?Maybe in part, says Elizabeth Somer, author ofNutrition for a Healthy Pregnancy. The extreme hormonal changes women go through during pregnancy can have a huge impact on taste and smell. (This would help explain why women going through menopause may also experience strong food cravings and aversions.) But the bottom line, says Somer, is that no one knows for sure.One thing we do know is that aversions and food cravings go hand in hand. In an Ethiopian study, women who experienced food aversions were more than twice as likely to crave food compared with those who didn't. And in studies at the University of Minnesota, Judith Brown found that pregnant women  like those we asked  prefer sweet tastes to salty ones.Pregnancy weight gain trackerSee your target weight range for pregnancy and whether your weight gain is on track.What do food cravings mean?Some nutritionists and healthcare providers believe that certain cravings are meaningful. For example, some experts think that craving large amounts of ice and nonfood substances, such as laundry starch and dirt or clay (a condition calledpica), are linked to an iron or zinc deficiency, though there's not enough research to support a cause and effect relationship.San Francisco midwife and herbalist Cynthia Belew says some food cravings may be worth paying attention to. For example, alternative medicine practitioners believe that a shortage ofmagnesium can trigger a craving for chocolate. Foods that contain magnesium include whole grains, beans, nuts, seeds, and green vegetables such as spinach.Belew has also found that many of her patients need moreessential fatty acidsin their diet. When they start taking fish oil or flax oil, their food cravings disappear.Similarly, a craving for red meat seems like a transparent cry for protein. And the mom in our survey who said she consumed great quantities of peaches may have been responding to her body's need for beta carotene.Brown agrees that in some cases there might be a biological cause for cravings. She points to pregnant women who develop an aversion to certain foods or drinks that might be harmful (like diet soda, coffee, or alcohol).Somer, on the other hand, doesn't see much of a link between a pregnant woman's cravings and what her body needs.""People think their cravings are significant, but studies show no link between cravings and nutritional requirements,"" she says. ""If people craved what the body needs, we would all eat more broccoli and less chocolate.""And at this point the evidence  while hard to ignore  is anecdotal.""There's no scientific explanation for food cravings. There's no data saying that what a woman craves is related to something her body or her baby needs, and there's no data to support that typical pregnancy food cravings are harmful, either,"" explains Brown. What to do about your cravingsIn the end, the experts we consulted agreed that you should pay attention to your pregnancy cravings  indulging the healthy ones and coming up withalternatives for less healthy cravings.""Most cravings and aversions are more interesting than serious and, for the most part, can be indulged in moderation,"" Somer says. ""A healthful diet is one that meets your nutritional and your emotional needs as well as your preferences.""She recommends that pregnant women humor their cravings rather than fight them by substituting low-fat frozen yogurt for ice cream, for example. Craving sweets is sometimes the result of a drop in blood sugar, so eating small, frequent meals may also help curb that desire to indulge in desserts.Other ways to curb unhealthy cravings: Eat breakfast every day (skipping breakfast can make cravings worse), get plenty of exercise, and make sure you have lots of emotional support.If you find yourself craving nonfood items, such as starch, chalk, flour, dirt, or large amounts of ice, mention it to your healthcare provider. Some studies estimate that more than a third of pregnant women have similar cravings. Because some nonfood cravings can affect your health, it's especially important to mention them to your provider.Learn more:Seven principles of eating well during pregnancy10 healthy snacks for pregnancyWhat nutritionists wish you'd do during pregnancyShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2014.

How to handle a picky eater,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-handle-a-picky-eater_9199.bc,"Why is my toddler such a picky eater?Eating solid food is still a new experience for your toddler. He may need time to get used to the various textures, colors, and tastes of new food. While young children crave consistency and familiarity with many things, from playtime routines to sleep habits, they're notoriously unpredictable when it comes to food  even familiar food.It's common for toddlers to vary their eating habits from day to day, and it's also common not to try new foods until you've served them numerous times. This may be partly due to the change in your toddler's nutrition requirements. He's not growing as much now as he was in his first year, so he's less interested in food and not eating as much.He's also becoming more independent and learning to make choices on his own  an important skill he'll need to develop over the years, especially when it comes to food.As frustrating as a finicky eater may be, this is a great time to teach your child to try new things, before he gets too set in his ways and begins to reject new foods as a way of asserting his independence (a distinct possibility as he nears his second birthday!). Offer a variety of healthy foods often, so he has the opportunity to dig in when he's ready  if not at lunch, then maybe during an afternoon snack.Picky eaters (Mom Confidential) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:18Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:18Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosTips for introducing new foods to a picky eaterYour child has an innate sense of how much food her body needs to grow and be healthy, and it's up to her to decide what she's going to eat. The best thing you can do is to provide plenty of healthy choices in a positive, relaxed environment so that mealtimes will be enjoyable for everyone. Here are some specific tips on how to handle a picky eater:Structure your child's eating so that she has three regular meals a day and two healthy snacks in between meals. Doctors say that most often picky eaters are ""grazers""  that is, kids who eat small amounts of food throughout the day. Making sure your child has set meal and snack times will help ensure she's eating when she's hungry and lessen the chance she'll snack too much.Serve a variety of good foods for your toddler to eat at each meal. When you offer a new food, simply place it on your child's highchair tray without making a big deal about it. Make sure the food you choose isage-appropriate.Introduce new foods one at a time and in small amounts. Instead of an entire meal of unfamiliar foods, for example, offer standard fare or favorites along with something new. Always include at least one thing you know your toddler likes at each meal.Try to schedule a new food when you know your child is hungry  a snack of mango slices when she has the afternoon munchies, for example.Use toddler-size portions. A serving size for a toddler is about 1/4 of a single portion for an adult. A serving of meat for a 1-year-old is about the size of the palm of her hand, and a serving of vegetables is only about 1 or 2 tablespoons.Understand that some children's palates are more sensitive than others. Some simply won't like the texture, color, or taste of certain foods. That's why a child might claim to dislike a food she has never even tried. Likewise, some children may reject a food because it reminds them of a time when they were sick or because they have some other negative association with it.Look for ways to boost the nutritional value of the dishes your toddler enjoys. Add some wheat germ or diced chicken to her macaroni casserole, pureed vegetables like carrots or spinach to pasta sauce, and little chunks of fruit to her favorite cereal, for example.Resist the urge to offer sugary foods in an effort to get your toddler to eat more. You want to develop her sense of culinary adventure, not her sweet tooth!Minimize distractions at the table. If a sibling is running around nearby or a cartoon beckons from across the room, your toddler may lose interest in the food being served. Try to make meals relaxed and quiet. How can I get my toddler to eat a wider variety of foods?It's not realistic to expect a toddler to embrace a wide range of foods. In the long run, the example you set by serving and enjoying all sorts of healthy foods  at home and on the go  is one of the best ways to help your child learn to eat well. But for now, your toddler's decision to eat only a few things is his choice, and it's important to let him learn to make his own decisions about food from the get-go.""A child needs to be in control of what he eats,"" says Nancy Hudson, a registered dietitian at the University of California, Berkeley. That's because forcing a toddler to eat a food he doesn't like or a quantity he can't handle may set him up for problems later on: Children who aren't allowed to make food decisions themselves (such as deciding when they're full) are at a greater risk for becoming obese later in life. Forcing your toddler to try new foods will only make him more stubborn and less open to trying new things in the future.If your toddler seems to be eating nothing but cheese and crackers for days on end, don't worry. Start keeping a record of what he eats and you'll probably find that he's hitting all the major food groups and getting the necessary nutrients over the course of a week. Studies from the American Dietetic Association show that children  even those whose parents consider them picky eaters  generally consume a wide enough variety of foods to meet their nutritional requirements.If you still don't think your toddler is eating well, ask your doctor whether it makes sense to give him a dailymultivitamin.How can I tell whether my child is really getting enough to eat if she's not growing?Don't panic if it seems like your toddler isn't growing fast enough. Children don't always grow at a steady pace and there will be times when your child doesn't seem to be growing at all. Your toddler won't grow at nearly the same rate she did in her first year of life.Keep in touch with your doctor if you're worried that your child isn't gaining enough weight, but don't convey your concerns to your child. If you're constantly hovering at mealtime, or wheedling, cajoling, and counting calories, she's likely to become even more resistant to eating.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011a.

Dealing with a sweet tooth (ages 2 to 4),https://www.babycenter.com/0_dealing-with-a-sweet-tooth-ages-2-to-4_64291.bc,"If your child pleads for sweets every chance she gets, you may be going crazy trying to figure out how to set limits without making sugary stuff forbidden food. But it's important to figure out how to teach your child moderation when she's young so she doesn't get into bad habits that will be harder to break later.How much is too much?Sweet treats are fine to give your child every now and then  just not every day. Reserve sweets for special occasions and dole them out in child-size portions. Generally, a portion size for a preschooler is a quarter to a half of an adult portion.Here are some examples of reasonable portion sizes for a young child: A mini candy bar, one or two small cookies, or a kid-size ice cream cone. If she whines for more, be firm and be consistent about the rules.How should I handle dessert?Most of the time, make dessert a healthy alternative: A baked apple with a small dollop of low-fat whipped cream and a few chopped nuts, a frozen fruit bar made with 100-percent juice, or low-fat, sugar-free pudding.And don't make dessert contingent on how much your child eats or use it as a reward or punishment. That only elevates it to a higher level, making it more important than a meal in his eyes and encouraging him to eat when he's full.Of course, it's important for your child to eat a nutritious meal first before having dessert. The sugar in a sweet treat releases insulin, which signals the brain to eat even more. To help your child get the nutrition he needs without overindulging, make it a family rule to always eat dinner before dessert.Treat dessert matter-of-factly. Tell him in advance ""This is it."" If he asks for more, simply say no.How do I handle incidental or after-school snacks?If you're headed to the market with your child in tow, be prepared to buy a snack if she asks for it, but make it something reasonably healthy. Try to shop after a meal, so she's not starving, and let her know she can pick only one item. When you get to the checkout lane, go to the one without a candy aisle.Young children are too little to choose from an entire aisle of food. It helps if you pick out two to three items that you find acceptable and that you know she likes, such as animal crackers or graham crackers. Then let her choose which one she wants.In general, limit the number of treats that you keep at home  one or two types of cookies and one flavor of ice cream, for example. And stock up on different healthy snacks. (But be aware that some snacks that seem healthy are actually loaded with sugar, like granola bars laced with chocolate chips and fruit drinks.) What are some healthy alternatives to sweets?Fresh or dried fruits, such as apricots, apples, or pears.Unsweetened yogurt mixed with a spoonful of jam, fresh fruit, or honey.Smoothies made with low-fat milk or yogurt and frozen fruit. (If you use juice in your smoothies, buy 100 percent fruit juice with no added sugar and give your child no more than 1/2 to 3/4 cup of juice a day.)Whole grain cinnamon toast. Spread wheat bread lightly with margarine, sprinkle with cinnamon and a dash of sugar, and toast it in a toaster oven.Graham crackers or rice cakes spread with peanut butter, dark chocolate, or low-fat cream cheese.A bowl of hot cereal with brown sugar or maple syrup on top.Frozen yogurt with fresh berries or roasted, low-salt nuts.Where can I find out more?To learn more about healthy eating and to ask questions about nutrition, visit the website of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics."

The worst foods for babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-worst-foods-for-babies_10320507.bc,"Babies don't need many calories, but they do need lots of nutrients. Yet some foods commonly offered to babies are essentially junk food  high in calories, sugar, or salt, and low in nutrients.Because babies are so small, it's easy for them to fill up quickly on the empty calories in junk food, leaving no room for nutrient-rich healthy foods. This nutritional deficit can even hinder development, says doctor and Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics spokesperson Christine Gerbstadt.That's why it's important to know which foods are best for babies and which ones to avoid, including junk food and potential choking hazards. Here's our list of the worst food choices for babies.Hot dogs and other dangerous foodsHard, sticky, slippery, chunky, and round foods are unsafe for young children because they can easily choke on them. So don't give your baby hot dogs, sausages, large pieces of meat or cheese, whole grapes, popcorn, chunky raw vegetables, and whole nuts and seeds.And once you start serving your baby finger foods, be sure to cut food into pieces no larger than half an inch.SodaSome babies are served soft drinks daily as early as 9 months of age, according to a 2008 survey of infant and toddler feeding habits. The same survey found that by 24 months, more than 10 percent of toddlers were drinking soda every day.Whether regular or diet, soda provides absolutely no nutrients, and filling up on either type means babies eat and drink less of the nutritious food their bodies really need. Regular soda also contains loads of sugar, which can cause tooth decay.How to care for your baby's teeth and gums Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 5:07Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -5:07Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosFrench friesAnother major 2008 study found that about 14 percent of 9-month-olds eat fries at least once a week. That figure goes up to more than 40 percent by 12 months of age, making french fries among the top vegetables consumed by toddlers  and marking the start of an unhealthy habit.It's a good idea to minimize all fast food because it's loaded with fat, sugar, salt, and calories but low in healthy nutrients. If you do need to grab a bite on the go, look for baby-friendly options. Many chains now offer healthier choices, including yogurt and applesauce.Processed foodsPeople define 'processed' in different ways, but in general, the more the food is modified from what was originally caught, raised, or grown  and the longer the list of ingredients  the more processed it is.""The more processed the food, the more nutritional value tends to go down, and the more the sugar, salt, and fat content goes up,"" says Kate Geagan, dietitian and author ofGo Green, Get Lean.Meals made specifically for babies can be healthy and appropriate. The best prepared baby foods have few ingredients and no added salt, sugar, or modified food starch.But ready-to-eat foods meant for older children and adults are definitely not good for babies. ""They often contain way too much sodium,"" says dietitian Eileen Behan, author ofThe Baby Food Bible.For example, instead of serving canned pasta entrees, it's better to boil some noodles and sprinkle some cheese on top. And instead of serving deli meats, which are often high in sodium and carry a risk of food poisoning, cut up small bits of roast chicken or hamburger.Gelatin dessertsMost varieties are nearly all sugar, artificial color, and artificial flavor with a small amount of gelatin to make it wiggly. Homemade gelatin made with fruit juice and sugar eliminates the artificial additives, but it's still essentially just fruit juice and sweetener.True, gelatin is easy to swallow, but so is Gerbstadt's suggestion for a healthy, baby-friendly dessert: a baked, mashed apple with a sprinkle of cinnamon. ""It's naturally sweet and has good fiber, vitamins, and a yummy, smooth texture,"" she says.Juice and fruit drinksSure, these beverages contain fruit, but that doesn't mean they're healthy. The fiber in fresh fruit is largely lost in the juicing process, and what's left is a whole lot of sugar. Juice can also cause diarrhea in some babies.""Juice is basically a waste of calories,"" says pediatrician Ari Brown, coauthor of Baby 411: Clear Answers and Smart Advice for Your Baby's First Year. Using juice to sweeten your baby's food isn't a good idea either: The sugars in juice can make food pass through the digestive tract more quickly, interfering with the body's ability to absorb nutrients.And don't be fooled by advertisers' claims that juice provides babies with necessary vitamin C. ""Babies can easily get their vitamin C from one small serving of fruit,"" says Brown.5 tips to develop healthy eating habits Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:05Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:05Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosIf your baby is younger than 6 months, don't give her any juice. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies younger than 6 months drink only breast milk or formula.If your baby is 6 months or older and you decide to give her juice, do it sparingly. The AAP recommends offering your baby no more than 4 to 6 ounces of 100 percent fruit juice a day. (Don't serve anything labeled fruit ""drink,"" ""cocktail,"" or ""beverage"" because these often contain only a tiny amount of juice and a lot of water, sweetener, and food coloring.)Babies 6 to 12 months old can have small amounts of water, but breast milk or formula should still be their main beverage. After your baby's first birthday,cow's milkis recommended (though your toddler can continue breastfeeding as long as you both enjoy it).Learn more:Age-by-age guide to feeding your babyBaby food revolution: New rules for feeding your babyHow to make your own baby foodShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a.

Picky eaters: The Texture Tyrant,https://www.babycenter.com/0_picky-eaters-the-texture-tyrant_10331646.bc,"When faced with a picky eater, how do you ensure your child gets the nutrients she needs - without a fight.? Our food experts offer strategies and recipes for your texture tyrant.See all eight picky eaters here.The Texture TyrantThe dilemma: Your child will only eat smooth foods, or she shies away from eating meat because of its texture.The nutritional concern: Avoiding certain textures can limit the amount of protein, fiber, and vitamins your child gets, depending on her specific quirk.Missy Chase Lapine, mother of two and author of The Sneaky Chef: To this day, my younger daughter prefers her food pureed to a smooth consistency. For some kids, texture is as important as taste and looks, and we have to respect that. We've made a lot of smoothies in our house. I sneak an avocado in strawberry smoothies to boost its nutrition profile.Ellyn Satter, mother of three, grandmother of six, and author of Secrets of Feeding a Healthy Family: A lot of young children don't like the texture of meat. For some, it's hard to chew and swallow. So find other protein sources, such as eggs, tofu, or black beans. And don't forget milk  a lot of children today don't drink enough milk.Jennifer Iserloh, private chef and author of Secrets of a Skinny Chef: Cooking techniques can help. Make sure there's enough liquid in meatloaf or meatballs. They'll probably prefer the softer texture. Here's a godsend: buttermilk.

See all videosRecipesHealthy Buttermilk Chicken FingersBy Jennifer IserlohThis is one of my most popular recipes  with adults and children alike! I love the taste of crispy chicken but prefer this version for a healthy everyday meal.I soak my chicken in low-fat buttermilk to tenderize it, giving it the same tender texture as the deep-fried version. If you have a busy schedule, you can soak the chicken overnight and purchase seasoned bread crumbs instead of making them.Little folk love to eat with their fingers, and this chicken is moist and tender enough for small mouths.Ingredients:2 skinless, boneless chicken breasts, cut into 1-inch strips (about 1 pound total)1 pint low-fat buttermilk3 sprigs fresh thyme or rosemary2 cloves garlic, peeled, slightly crushed with the palm of your hand1 large resealable bag1 egg2 cups whole wheat bread crumbs2 tablespoons sesame seeds1 teaspoon garlic powder1 teaspoon onion powder1 tablespoon dried parsley, or 1 tablespoon minced fresh1/4 cup finely grated Parmesan cheese1/2 teaspoon salt, divided1/8 teaspoon pepperInstructions:Place the chicken, buttermilk, thyme or rosemary, and garlic into a large resealable bag. Place in refrigerator for 4 hours or overnight up to 10 hours.On a piece of wax paper or aluminum foil, mix bread crumbs, sesame seeds, onion and garlic powder, parsley, and Parmesan cheese.Once chicken has finished marinating, remove from bag and pat dry with a paper towel. Discard buttermilk.Beat the egg well and place it in a shallow dish.Sprinkle both sides of the chicken with half the salt and black pepper, dip into egg, and press into the bread crumb mixture.Place cutlets into the fridge (to help the bread crumbs stick to the meat) while you preheat the oven to 400 degrees F.Place a wire rack on top of a cookie sheet so that both sides of the cutlet will crisp.Spray both sides of the cutlets with nonfat cooking spray. Place the cutlets on the rack and bake for 15 to 20 minutes, turning once, until meat is no longer pink inside.Remove from rack, sprinkle with additional 1/4 teaspoon of salt and serve.Makes 8 servings.HummusBy Ann Cooper, nutrition expert who revamps school cafeterias around the country and coauthor of Lunch LessonsAlthough hummus is widely available in the supermarket, many packaged varieties are loaded with salt. Try making hummus at home so you can carefully control your seasonings. Serve the dip with whole wheat pita bread. Hummus also makes a flavorful sandwich spread in place of mayonnaise.Ingredients:1 cup dried garbanzo beans2 cups extra virgin olive oil1 1/2 tablespoons lemon juice3 cloves garlic3 tablespoons tahini1/4 teaspoon salt1/8 teaspoon pepperInstructions:In at least 4 cups of water, bring the garbanzo beans to a boil. Reduce to a simmer and cook until tender. Reserve some of the cooking liquid.Combine all ingredients in a food processor until very smooth. If the consistency is too thick, add some of the reserved cooking liquid and process again until smooth.Makes 24 servings.Orange SherbetBy Jennifer IserlohThis healthy version of orange sherbet reminds me of the Push-Up pops I used to have as a kid. Just like those nostalgic treats, these are refreshingly cool during the hot summer months. Ingredients:1 1/2 tablespoons grated orange zest2/3 cup granulated sugar1 cup frozen orange juice concentrate2 cups nonfat milk2 cups nonfat plain yogurtInstructions:Mix all ingredients in a blender or food processor until smooth. Pour into ice pop molds or freeze in an airtight container for 3 to 4 hours or until firm.Makes 8 servings.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011. Unsafe foods for toddlers.

Trying to conceive? Five changes to make to your diet now,https://www.babycenter.com/0_trying-to-conceive-five-changes-to-make-to-your-diet-now_3558.bc,"Don't wait until you're pregnant to improve your eating habits. Set the stage now with healthy diet changes to ensure your baby gets off to a strong start.Pay attention to your dietFor both men and women, food and fertility are linked. Stick to a balanced diet to boost your chances of a healthy baby.Eat several servings of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and calcium-rich foods such as yogurt, cheese, and milk every day. Not getting enough nutrients can affect your periods, making it difficult to predict when you ovulate. And you may not ovulate at all if you're significantly underweight or obese.Your partner should also pay attention to his diet since certain vitamins and nutrients  such as zinc and vitamins C and E, and folic acid  are important for making healthy sperm.How can I get pregnant quickly?

See all videosFish is a nutritional powerhouse for a growing baby, offering low-fat protein with omega-3 fatty acids, but you need to take care to avoid types that are high in mercury, which can be dangerous to your unborn baby. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration urges women to eat 8 to 12 ounces of a variety of fish each week.Because mercury can accumulate in your body and linger there for more than a year, avoid high-mercury fish such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish. Instead, eat lower-mercury fish such as salmon and canned light tuna (not albacore, which is higher in mercury) once or twice a week. Read more oneating fish while trying to conceive.Processed meats can be particularly dangerous for pregnant women and should be consumed in small amounts, and smoked or raw meats should be avoided entirely during pregnancy. Even hot dogs or deli meats should be heated until they are steaming before you eat them if you are pregnant.Practice good habits for pregnancyFor many moms-to-be, pregnancy prompts an abrupt change in eating and drinking habits  but some habits are hard to break. Make it easier on yourself by changing habits now, and help ensure your baby gets off to a good start from the moment you conceive.Some solid advice: The occasional bottle of beer or glass of wine probably won't affect your chances of getting pregnant, but alcohol can harm a developing baby. And since you may not know exactly when you ovulate or conceive, you may want to play it safe and cut out alcohol completely. (For non-alcoholic alternatives, see our list of the best virgin drinks).On a related note, if you use any recreational drugs or smoke, quit now. All of these substances and habits can harm a developing fetus.You may also want to cut back on caffeine. The research on whether caffeine can affect fertility is mixed. Experts generally agree that low to moderate caffeine consumption, less than 300 mg a day or about the equivalent of two 8-ounce cups of coffee, won't affect your fertility, but your healthcare provider may recommend that you cut caffeine out entirely to play it safe. Learn more aboutcaffeine and fertility.And once you're pregnant, experts recommend limiting yourself to less than 200 milligrams a day of caffeine  that's a little less than a 12-ounce cup of coffee  because higher amounts have been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage. If you have a strong coffee or soda habit, you might want to start weaning yourself off caffeine now.Take prenatal vitaminsAlthough you can meet almost all of your nutritional needs through a balanced diet, many experts believe that even the healthiest eaters can use extra help. Taking a prenatal vitamin ensures that you're getting enough folic acid and other essential nutrients to boost your chances of conceiving a healthy baby.Remember that a supplement is a safeguard, not a substitute for a sound diet. And since regular over-the-counter multivitamins may contain megadoses of vitamins and minerals that could be harmful to a developing baby, choose a pill formulated specifically for pregnant women. If you have a vegetarian diet, you may also need vitamin D and B-12 supplements, along with extra protein. Talk with your healthcare provider about the right prenatal supplement for you.Get enough folic acidFolic acid has been proven to reduce a baby's risk of neural-tube birth defects such as spina bifida, and it is linked to a lower incidence of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and diabetes.Most women of child-bearing age should take a supplement with 400 micrograms (mcg) daily for at least a month before pregnancy, and 600 micrograms during pregnancy. If you have a family history of neural-tube birth defects or take medication for seizures, your healthcare provider may suggest that you boost your daily intake to 4,000 mcg, or 4 mg, starting at least a month before you conceive and continuing throughout your first trimester.A good over-the-counter prenatal vitamin should contain more than the minimum recommendation of folic acid, between 600 and 800 mcg  what you'll need during pregnancy. In addition, you can eat folate-rich foods, such as dark green leafy vegetables like spinach or kale, citrus fruits, nuts, legumes, whole grains, and fortified breads and cereals.Folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, so your body will flush out the excess if you consume too much. But there's a downside to being water-soluble, too: You can lose a lot of this vitamin in cooking water, so steam or cook vegetables in a small amount of water to preserve the folate.Be aware that getting too much folate may hide a vitamin B-12 deficiency, which is sometimes a problem for vegetarians. Ask your doctor or midwife if you think you may be at risk.Maintain a healthy weightIt might be a good idea to shed some pounds, or gain a few if you're underweight, while you're trying to get pregnant, since you want to be as close as possible to your recommended weight when you conceive. Being over- or underweight can make it harder to get pregnant. Also, obese women have more pregnancy and birth complications, and underweight women are more likely to have a low-birth-weight baby.In addition to following a smart eating plan with low-fat, high-fiber foods, get regular exercise. If you're overweight, aim to lose one to two pounds a week, a safe rate of weight loss. Extreme weight loss from crash dieting can deplete your body's nutritional stores, which isn't a good way to start a pregnancy.Show sources Hide sources Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Undated.

How to handle a picky eater (ages 2 to 4),https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-handle-a-picky-eater-ages-2-to-4_64302.bc,"Why is my child such a picky eater?It's perfectly normal for preschoolers to object to the shape, color, or texture of a food  or to suddenly decide that they hate everything, even foods they loved yesterday. It's also common for them to have what experts call food jags. That is, they insist on eating the same few foods at every meal.""It's a fear of new things,"" says Nancy Hudson, a registered dietitian at the University of California, Berkeley. ""We think it's one of those quirks that humans probably developed to protect themselves as mankind evolved. You don't try new things because you don't know if they're safe.""This fear of new things usually tapers off by age 4 or 5, but for some children it continues into adulthood. At any rate, whether it's his bedtime routine or his peanut butter sandwich cut on the diagonal, your child probably likes things to be consistent and familiar, and he may not be willing to try new foods until you've served them numerous times.Picky eating can also be a preschooler's way of declaring his independence (""You can't make me eat that""). It may have less to do with the actual food than a need to test the limits of your authority and assert some control over his life.Finally, because preschoolers are a wiggly lot, it may seem as though your child can't sit still long enough to eat very much at one sitting. You can try to keep your child interested in his food longer by making mealtime as calm and uneventful as possible, without distractions from toys, television, or pets.Tips for introducing new foods to a picky eaterYour child has an innate sense of how much food her body needs to grow and be healthy, and it's up to her to decide what she's going to eat. The best thing you can do is provide a wide variety of healthy food in a positive, relaxed environment so mealtimes are enjoyable for everyone. Here are some specific tips on how to handle a picky eater:Offer your preschooler a variety of food at each meal. And be patient  you may have to serve a new food many times before your child is ready to try it. When you do introduce something new, simply place it on the table with everything else, and don't make a big deal about it. Putting it right on your child's plate may seem threatening or cause her to rebel. Eventually, after she's seen you eat the food a few times, she may feel more open to trying it.Serve child-size portions. A child's portion is about half the size of an adult's portion. For many foods, that's a portion about the size of your child's palm. Examples of other child-size servings are 1/2 a cup of cereal or yogurt, 2 ounces of meat, 4 tablespoons of vegetables, and one slice of bread.Don't give your preschooler too many options. ""If you say 'It's dinnertime. What do you want to eat?' your child will probably choose something familiar, and she'll seem like a picky eater,"" says Hudson. However, if you say ""Here's dinner,"" she'll have to choose from the food you're offering. Of course, you won't want to offer an entire meal of unfamiliar foods because your child simply won't eat any of them. Instead, always include at least one thing you know your child likes.Introduce small amounts of new foods. When your preschooler is interested in trying a new food, give her just a taste and let her ask for more. That way she'll feel more in control and you won't feel like you're wasting food if she doesn't eat it. When you can, give her a new food to try when you know she's hungry  slices of mango as an afternoon snack, for example.Keep in mind that children can have a sensitive palate. Many kids simply don't like the texture, color, or taste of some foods. That's why a child might claim to dislike a food she has never even tried. Likewise, some children may reject a food because it reminds them of a time when they were sick, or because they have some other negative association. If your preschooler complains that a particular food will make her sick, stop offering that food for a while. You can try again when she's a bit older.Whenever possible, involve your preschooler in food preparation. This can include shopping and making meals and snacks. And if she can help you grow some of the family's produce in the yard, so much the better! This gives her a sense of control over her diet. And she just may be more likely to eat something that she's chosen or prepared. This works best if you let your child choose from a small selection of foods you've already chosen, rather than just asking her to pick her supper. Make fun, healthful treats together  like yogurt-and-fruit banana splits or ants on a log (raisins placed on top of peanut-butter-filled celery sticks).Look for ways to boost the nutritional value of the foods your preschooler enjoys. Put some tuna or ham on her grilled cheese, and meat or tofu in her spaghetti sauce, for example.Teach your child (without lecturing) about good nutrition. Hang a food chart in the kitchen and have her color in the requirements as she meets them each day. Nonchalantly mention that eating her oatmeal will help her run and jump better this morning.Be a good role model and eat the kinds of food that you want your child to eat. Family mealtimes are a great way to connect with your child and share enjoyable and nourishing food together.Don't cater to your preschooler's pickiness. While it was fine to indulge your toddler's desire to have his cheese sandwiches cut into star or moon shapes, your preschooler is getting old enough to eat without special gimmicks.As your child's world expands and she begins attending preschool, her taste in foods might broaden as well. It's not uncommon for children to be more open to new foods when they're away from home. Give your picky eater healthy choicesIt's unrealistic to expect a preschooler to eat a wide range of foods. In the long run, the example you set by serving and enjoying all sorts of healthy foods  at home and on the go  is one of the best ways to help your child learn to eat well. But for now, try to remember that your child's choice to eat only a few foods is just that  his choice, and it's important to let him learn to make his own decisions about food.""A child needs to be in control of what he eats,"" says Hudson. If you force your preschooler to eat a food he doesn't like (""You'll sit at the table until you finish your peas""), or more than he wants, you could be setting him up for problems later:Children who are never allowed to make food decisions for themselves (such as deciding when they're full) are at a greater risk for developing eating disorders or becoming obese later in life. What's more, this strategy almost always backfires because forcing your child to try new foods may only make him more stubborn and less open to trying new things in the future.If your preschooler seems to eat nothing but cheese and crackers for days on end, don't worry. Start keeping a record of what your child eats  you'll probably find that he's hitting all the major food groups and getting the necessary nutrients over the course of a week. Studies from the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics show that children  even those whose parents consider them ""picky eaters""  generally consume a wide enough variety of food to meet their nutritional requirements. If you really don't think your preschooler is eating well, ask your doctor whether it makes sense to give him a daily multivitamin.Don't panic if your picky eater isn't growing fastDon't panic if it seems like your preschooler isn't growing fast enough. Children don't always grow at a steady pace, and there will be times when your child doesn't seem to be growing at all.Check in with your doctor if you're concerned, but don't convey your fears to your child. If you're constantly hovering at mealtime, wheedling, cajoling, and counting bites, she's likely to become even more resistant to eating. Also keep in mind that your child's appetite will vary, depending on things like her activity level and whether she's having a growth spurt.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011a.

Many parents aren't sure how to cook fish and this recipe not only makes it easy, but it's a big hit with kids. I noticed that frozen fish sticks are usually loaded with trans fats and unwanted preservatives  things that don't help little bodies grow strong.Ingredients:1 pound fish fillet (wild salmon or tilapia), skinless, boneless, cut into 3- to 4-inch-long strips1 cup bread crumbs, whole wheat or white1/4 cup yellow cornmeal2 egg whites1 tablespoon grated Parmesan1/4 teaspoon paprika1/2 teaspoon garlic powder1/2 teaspoon onion powder1/4 teaspoon salt1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper1 tablespoon olive oilNonfat cooking sprayInstructions:On a piece of wax paper or aluminum foil, stir together bread crumbs, cornmeal, Parmesan cheese, paprika, and garlic and onion powder.Spread out the fish out on a piece of wax paper or aluminum foil. Sprinkle both sides with salt and pepper.In a shallow dish, beat egg whites. Dip the fish into the egg, and then coat with the bread crumb mixture.Coat a large skillet with cooking spray. Heat the olive oil over medium-high heat. Brown the fish nuggets on the first side, cooking 3 to 4 minutes, until bread crumb coating is crispy and golden.Turn fish sticks and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes until fish is no longer translucent and is cooked through.Serve immediately or cool completely before packing in an airtight container.Makes 4 servings.Roasted Garbanzo BeansBy Jennifer IserlohWe all know kids love potato chips, but the next time they're begging for a bag, try giving them these roasted garbanzo beans. Flavored with garlic and chili powder (reduce the amount if you don't like spice), these high-fiber, high-protein snacks will satisfy your kids' salt cravings (and your own).Ingredients:2 15-ounce cans garbanzo beans, drained and rinsed1 tablespoon olive oil1 teaspoon sweet chili powder1/2 teaspoon garlic powder1/8 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper1/4 teaspoon sea saltInstructions:Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.

I tested these out on my 'big kid' (my husband), as well as my friend Chad's 7-year-old son, Luke.""Ingredients:2 pounds chicken tenders or skinless boneless breasts, thinly sliced1/2 teaspoon salt1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper1/4 teaspoon paprika2 egg whites1 1/2 cups cooked red or white quinoa1/2 cup whole-wheat bread crumbs2 tablespoons olive oilInstructions:Spread the cooked quinoa on a piece of wax paper or aluminum foil.Sprinkle the bread crumbs over the quinoa. With your fingertips, squeeze the quinoa and bread crumbs together until the moisture of the quinoa is absorbed. Sprinkle the chicken with salt, garlic powder, pepper, and paprika.Place the egg whites in a shallow bowl. Dip the chicken in the egg and then into the quinoa mixture. Place on a plate.Warm a large skillet over high heat. Add the oil. When the oil is hot, add the chicken and lower heat to medium. Cook each side 4 to 5 minutes, turning once, until the crust begins to brown and the chicken is no longer translucent.Transfer chicken to a plate and serve immediately.Serves 4 kids or 2 hungry adults.Oven-Fried ChickenBy Ann CooperFried chicken is an American institution. It's everywhere  and let's face it, it's good. This healthy version was developed by chefs from the Ross School, and it's even better than some of the deep-fried versions. And the best part? No oily mess in the kitchen afterward. You will need to plan ahead, because the chicken should be marinated overnight to allow the buttermilk enough time to tenderize the meat. Make it for dinner and send it to school cold the next day for lunch.Ingredients:1 1/2 cups buttermilk1 teaspoon kosher salt1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper3 pounds chicken, cut into eight pieces1 1/2 cups bread crumbs3/4 cup flour3/4 cup cornmeal3/4 teaspoon chili powder1/4 teaspoon paprika1 teaspoon kosher salt1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepperInstructions:The night before: Mix buttermilk, salt, and pepper. Marinate chicken in the buttermilk mixture in the refrigerator overnight.The next day: Combine the bread crumbs, flour, cornmeal, chili powder, paprika, salt, and pepper in a large bowl. Mix well.Remove chicken from the marinade and roll in the bread crumb mixture. If it's very wet, let it dry in the refrigerator for 1 to 3 hours.Before removing the chicken from the refrigerator, preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Bake chicken for 45 to 50 minutes or to an internal temperature of at least 165 degrees.Note: If you allow the bread crumb coating to dry in the refrigerator, be careful that it doesn't get overly dry. If it does, just spray with water before putting it in the oven.Makes 8 servings.Show sources Hide sources USDA. Undated. Is it done yet?

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),https://www.babycenter.com/0_inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd_1389867.bc,"My child may have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). What is IBD?IBD is a disease in which parts of the intestines become inflamed and may develop ulcers, or sores. Experts don't know what causes this disease, but most likely it's at least partially inherited.Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation, as well as weight loss, fever, exhaustion, and the urge to have a bowel movement even when the bowels are empty. Because IBD causes ulcers in the intestines, there may also be blood in the stools.There are two kinds of IBD: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). UC affects the inner lining of the large intestine; CD affects deeper layers of tissue, usually in the small intestine and the colon. But Crohn's can appear in any or all parts of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus.Current treatments can put these conditions into remission, but children with IBD may have flare-ups throughout life. That said, in general children with IBD can attend school regularly, participate in sports and activities, and lead healthy, happy lives.About a million people in the United States have IBD, and while the peak incidence is between the ages of 15 and 25 years, it can strike at any time. In fact, 25 to 30 percent of patients with CD and 20 percent of patients with UC are under the age of 20. And the number of early childhood cases has been increasing.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.How is IBD diagnosed?Your child's doctor will order some initial tests, such as stool studies and blood work. If those test results point to IBD  or if the symptoms persist  you'll be referred to a gastroenterologist.The gastroenterologist may order more blood and stool tests, and will perform an endoscopy, a colonoscopy, or both.For those procedures, a tiny tube with a camera on it (an endoscope) is passed through the mouth (for the upper gastrointestinal tract), through the anus (for the lower gastrointestinal tract) into your child's colon, or both. The doctor may also take a tissue sample from the intestines to look for signs of inflammation under a microscope. The procedure isn't painful, but kids are typically sedated.To help confirm the diagnosis and make sure no other conditions are involved, the doctor may also order imaging studies, such as X-rays, a CT scan, or an MRI of your child's abdomen.What's the treatment for IBD?Inflammatory bowel disease is often treated with a combination of medications. Steroids and drugs that suppress the immune system both reduce inflammation. Antibiotics can help heal any infections in the gastrointestinal tract.Once the inflammation and other symptoms (such as diarrhea) are gone and the intestinal lining has healed, the disease is in remission. Your child may be kept on some medications to prevent a relapse.Although no dietary change has been clearly shown to help IBD, most kids with IBD need to pay attention to their diet to help control their symptoms and maintain good nutrition. The best diet for a child depends on whether he has CD or UC, and it may involve keeping track of what he eats to identify foods that cause increased symptoms.He may also need to eat specific nutrient-rich foods and take supplements to make up for any deficiencies caused by the disease. For some children with CD, a liquid formula diet for a period of four to six weeks can help improve symptoms, maintain remission, and reverse poor weight gain and growth.The only way to ""cure"" UC is by surgically removing the entire colon. (Of course, this is considered only for severe and persistent cases. Your child may have a mild or manageable case.) There is no permanent cure for CD.The goal for both conditions is to get them into remission and keep them there.Does IBD cause other health problems?IBD can cause liver disease, gallstones, or kidney stones. It can also cause anemia because someone with intestinal ulcers can lose a lot of blood.Areas of the body outside the gastrointestinal tract (such as the joints, skin, or eyes) can develop problems. CD can also cause fistulas: tunnels of tissue that develop between sections of intestine or between the intestine and the skin, anus, or vagina. They're dangerous because they can become infected.CD can leave scars in the small intestine, creating blockages. These can interfere with the ability of your child's small intestine to absorb nutrients. For as many as 30 percent of kids with CD, this delays development and stunts their growth.UC increases the risk for colon cancer later on in life. In rare cases, a bad bout of colitis or CD can lead to a serious condition called toxic megacolon, in which the colon becomes paralyzed and can't function normally. If this happens, medications can often correct it, but if not, part of the colon has to be surgically removed.Article reviewed by Maria Olivia-Hemker, M.D., Chief of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Stermer Family Professor of Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and co-editor of Your Child With Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Johns Hopkins Press).Show sources Hide sources Johns Hopkins Children's Center. 2011.

What to expect at your prenatal visits,https://www.babycenter.com/0_what-to-expect-at-your-prenatal-visits_9252.bc,"How many prenatal visits will I have?You'll see a lot of your healthcare practitioner during your pregnancy  that's why it's so important to choose someone you like and trust. Most pregnant women have between ten and 15 prenatal visits.If you have a partner or labor coach, you may want that person to come to some of these appointments with you.Typically, a mom-to-be will visit her doctor or midwife every four weeks during the first and second trimesters. In the third trimester, you'll be seen more often, typically once every two weeks until 36 weeks, then weekly until the baby is born.For more information on what happens at these visits, see:Your first prenatal visitSecond trimester prenatal visits (14 weeks to 27 weeks)Third trimester prenatal visits (28 weeks through the end of pregnancy)But the number of scheduled appointments you'll have depends on your medical history and whether you have any complications or conditions such as high blood pressure that warrant more frequent checkups. If you've had any medical problems in the past or develop any new problems during this pregnancy, you may need more prenatal visits than average.Is there anything I need to do to prepare for my prenatal visits?During the weeks before each visit, jot down any questions or concerns in a notebook so you'll remember to ask your practitioner about them at your next appointment. You may be surprised by how many questions you have, so don't miss the opportunity to get some answers in person.For example, before you drink an herbal tea or take a supplement or an over-the-counter medication, bring it with you to your next appointment so your doctor or midwife can read the label and let you know whether it's okay to ingest.Of course, if you have any pressing questions or worries, or develop any unusual symptoms, don't wait for your appointment  call your practitioner right away.Pregnancy swelling (edema) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:50Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:50Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Get tips for prevention and when to call your doctor. See all pregnancy videosWhat happens during these appointments?Your practitioner will start by asking how you're feeling physically and emotionally, whether you have any complaints or worries, and what questions you may have. Your practitioner will have other questions as well, which will vary depending on how far along you are and whether there are specific concerns.The goal of prenatal visits is to see how your pregnancy is proceeding and to provide you with information to help keep you and your baby healthy. It's important that you go to all of your prenatal appointments, even if you're feeling just fine and believe that everything is progressing perfectly.Your midwife or doctor will check your weight, blood pressure, and urine; measure your abdomen; check the position of your baby; listen to your baby's heartbeat; perform other exams and order tests, as appropriate; and closely monitor any complications you have or that you develop, and intervene if necessary.At the end of the visit, your practitioner will review the findings with you, explain the normal changes to expect before your next visit and the warning signs to watch for, counsel you about lifestyle issues (such as the importance of good nutrition and avoiding tobacco, alcohol, and drugs), and discuss the pros and cons of optional tests you may want to consider. It seems like my prenatal visits are over before they even start. How can I make the most of my appointments?Many women look forward to their prenatal appointments but are disappointed to find that, with the exception of the first visit, they're in and out of the office in ten minutes. A quick visit is usually a sign that everything is progressing normally. Still, you want to make sure that your concerns are addressed  and that you and your baby are being well taken care of.Here are some things you can do to insure that your prenatal visits are satisfying:Speak up. Your practitioner isn't a mind reader and won't be able to tell what you're thinking just by performing a physical examination. So if anything is bothering you, speak up. Consult the notebook of questions you've been compiling. In addition to any physical complaints you may have, let your practitioner know if you have any emotional concerns or fitness or nutrition questions.Ask the staff about the administrative stuff. Save your questions about things like insurance and directions to the hospital for the office staff so your practitioner has more time to answer your important questions.Be open-minded. When talking with your doctor or midwife, you should feel comfortable speaking freely, but remember to listen, too. Take notes, if you find it helpful.And keep in mind that some days are busier than others. That doesn't mean your practitioner doesn't have to answer your questions, but sometimes a discussion can be continued at the next visit if it's a really busy day or if your practitioner needs to head to the hospital to deliver a baby.At the same time, don't tolerate a healthcare practitioner who won't give you thorough answers, doesn't show reasonable compassion, or barely looks up from your chart. You and your baby deserve more than that."
Gas pain (ages 3 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_gas-pain-ages-3-to-8_66306.bc,"How can I help relieve my child's indigestion or tell if it's something more serious?Intestinal gas is a perfectly normal occurrence in children and in adults. (We grown-ups pass, on average, 2 liters of gas a day.) In most cases, it isn't a cause for concern, unless your child is experiencing more than minor discomfort and complaining a lot. The best thing you can do is to try to eliminate or manage the offending food or habit that's triggering your child's gas. When your child does have uncomfortable gas pain, you can give him an ant-acid (such as Mylanta Supreme) as well as an anti-gas agent (such as Mylicon) to reduce upper and lower gastrointestinal discomfort. But if you find yourself treating your child several times a day for more than three consecutive days, or his gas coincides with other symptoms, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or fever, call your doctor. Your child might have a more serious condition such as a food allergy or lactose intolerance.How can I tell what's causing my child's gas?There could be several factors causing your child to have more gas or indigestion than usual:Roaming around during mealsMany time-crunched parents today find that we'll do anything to get our kids to eat right, including letting them meander around house, watch television, or even roughhouse during meals. Not a good idea. ""When kids roam and play while they eat, they can get excited and trap air in their intestinal tracts,"" says Michael Hart, director of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition at Carilion Medical Center for Children in Roanoke, Virginia.Odds are, if your child is a roamer, he eats fast or gulps so his chewing doesn't impede his playing, which also increases air consumption and isn't good for digestion. (It can also increase his risk of choking.) And if he has meals while watching television, he might ignore his body's signals that he's full and overeat. Encourage your child to sit at the table with you during meals, chew his food well, and take his time when he eats. Reassure him that when he's done, he can play as long as he wants to.Eating a lot of high-fiber foods, like cereal, or fatty foods, like French friesSome children's guts may be sensitive to fiber or fat. Take note of which types of foods bring on your child's bouts of gastrointestinal distress and try limiting them. You might also discuss his diet with your pediatrician, who could have other suggestions.Chewing gumThe artificial sweeteners in sugar-free gum are difficult for some children to digest. They get trapped in the colon and are fermented into intestinal gas. Chewing gum also increases the odds of swallowing excess air. Try your best to limit your child's gum chewing.Eating certain vegetablesLike adults, children can experience additional gas when they eat vegetables like beans, broccoli, and cauliflower. If your child eats these healthy foods, that's a good thing. Just make sure you don't overload him with too many gas-inducing veggies at consecutive meals.Drinking a lot of juiceIn general, parents misunderstand the benefits of giving kids juice. If your child is drinking more than a glass a day, it might be causing him to have a little extra gas. Some children have a difficult time digesting the fructose and sucrose in juice. As a result, it can bring on gas, even diarrhea, and make a child feel too full come mealtime. Plus, it bathes the teeth in sugar. Ideally, a child over the age of 3 shouldn't be drinking more than one 6- to 8-oz. glass of juice a day.Drinking a lot of sodaCarbonated drinks like soda contain phosphoric acid, which can cause excessive gas and indigestion. Soda also tends to make children feel full, so they don't drink the necessary milk and water they should or get all the nutrients they need throughout the day. Try to discourage your child from drinking soda at all or at least limit it to special occasions or birthday parties.Not drinking enough waterDrinking water won't eliminate your child's gas problem, but it will help improve any constipation or difficulty he might have passing stools (constipation often coincides with gas and abdominal discomfort). Make sure your child has several glasses of water each day in addition to the milk or juice you give him.Source: Dr. Michael Hart, director of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition at Carilion medical Center for Children in Roanoke, Virginia"
Staff in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU),https://www.babycenter.com/0_staff-in-the-neonatal-intensive-care-unit-nicu_10300038.bc,"Babies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) need constant monitoring and 24-hour care from different healthcare professionals. You'll want to get to know the doctors, nurses, and other staff members who care for your baby.There are also staff members whose role is to help you with specific concerns. They'll be valuable sources of information in the days and weeks to come.These health professionals are all part of a team that's working to help your baby get stronger and to help youcope with this difficult time. (You're also an important member of the team of people who care for your baby. You should never hesitate toask questions about how your baby's doingor tolearn ways you can help.)Here are the staff members you're likely to meet in the NICU:Clinical nurse specialist (CNS)This type of nurse has special training in the care of children. The CNS provides support and teaches parents about what is going on with their baby.NeonatologistA neonatologist is a children's doctor (pediatrician) with advanced training in the care of sick newborns. The neonatologist in charge of the NICU is sometimescalled the ""attending"" doctor. There may be several neonatologists in the NICU.Neonatology fellowThis is a fully trained pediatrician who is receiving advanced training in the care of sick newborns.Neonatal nurse practitioner (NNP)A NNP has special nursing and medical training in caring for sick and premature babies. The neonatal nurse practitioner works with the neonatologist and medical team and canperform medical procedures, prescribe medicines, and help direct your baby's care.

Healthy food swaps,https://www.babycenter.com/0_healthy-food-swaps_10381493.bc,"You know your family should be eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes  they're nutrient-rich, heart-healthy, planet-friendly foods.But it's not always easy, especially when you're feeding picky eaters. Try these stealthy switch-ups and fun presentations to deliver more nutrition without alerting the finicky folks in your family grown-ups too!Blend in veggiesUsing a hand blender or food processor, puree a mix of vegetables and stir it into tomato-based dishes like pasta sauce or chili. This is an easy way to add vitamins, nutrients, and fiber while avoiding recognizable chunks of vegetables your child might otherwise reject. You can use this trick with soups and casseroles too.Choose whole grain tortillasA lot of people don't like whole-grain bread and pasta if they're used to white-flour versions. It can take time for your palate to adjust, like changing from whole milk to low-fat or skim. But whole grains have a delicious, nutty flavor that you may come to prefer  and so might your child, given enough exposure.Tortillas can be a good place to start. Burritos, enchiladas, or tacos  especially when smothered in a zesty tomato sauce  are a great way to sneak in some whole grains. Thanks to bold flavors, your child probably won't notice that healthy wrapper.Pick fruit instead of fruit juiceKids love fruit juices, but most drink too much. It's better to eat whole fruit, which has more fiber and fewer calories. If you do give your child juice, make sure it's 100 percent juice to avoid added sugar, and try diluting it so it's at least half water.Also, keep in mind the American Academy of Pediatrics' advice when it comes to juice: No juice for babies younger than 6 months, limit daily servings of juice to 4 to 6 ounces for children 6 and younger, and no more than 8 to 12 ounces for kids 7 and older.Vary your proteins with tofuIt's smart to consume a variety of proteins, and tofu is a great source that doesn't call attention to itself when mixed with other ingredients. Try adding chopped tofu to a bean-and-corn burrito, for example. (""This chicken is delicious!"" said one of my unwitting friends when served refried-bean-and-tofu enchiladas one evening.)Tofu also works great chopped up and scrambled like eggs in a breakfast burrito or mixed in with sliced vegetables for a quick stir-fry. Use silken tofu in fruit smoothies for a healthy treat.Make things tastier with nut buttersNuts are nutrient powerhouses, rich in heart-healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. The tried-and-true trick of slathering peanut butter onto celery sticks or apples is a winner (as long as your child doesn't have a nut allergy, of course).Adding raisins or dried cranberries is a yummy way to increase fruit consumption  though you'll want to watch the portions, as dried fruits and nut butters are energy dense. Peanut butter is classic, but there are lots of other nut butters to try. Diversity is key to a healthy diet.Add veggies to tuna saladAdding finely diced carrots, celery, onions, peppers, and even radishes to tuna sandwiches is a good way to tuck in extra veggies. It might take some trial and error to see what your child will accept, but you'll probably be able to include at least a few of these vegetables with success.How about adding a drizzle of olive oil too? He won't taste it next to the mayo, but olive oil will add valuable phytonutrients and monounsaturated fat for a heart-healthier sandwich filling.Try whole grain pastaSame approach here as with tortillas  the whole-grain version is healthier and can be easier to introduce when served with a hearty sauce. Start with a little whole-grain pasta mixed in with your regular brand to help your child adjust to the taste, and in a couple of months you can make the full swap. You can try the same thing when switching from white to brown rice.Substitute white whole-wheat flourWhite whole-wheat flour is one of the best things to hit the market in recent years. It doesn't work for all baked goods, but you can use it in many items (or use half white flour and half white whole-wheat flour) and no one will be able to tell. You can make healthier chocolate chip cookies and brownies, but these are still once-in-a-while treats, not health foods.Learn more:Find ideas for quick and healthy snacksSeven strategies for feeding a picky eaterCooking with kidsP.

Choosing to formula-feed,https://www.babycenter.com/0_choosing-to-formula-feed_471.bc,"I want to formula-feed my baby, but everybody says it's better to breastfeed. Is this true?Both formula feeding and breastfeeding are valid, healthy choices for your baby. The decision to do one or the other  or a combination of both  is purely personal and depends on what's right for your family and circumstances.Breast milk gives your baby the best possible nutrition, protects against infection, and even adjusts to meet your infant's nutritional needs (something formula can't do). You benefit too: Breastfeeding helps you bond with your baby, and research suggests it may even lower your risk of ovarian and breast cancers.If possible, you may want to try nursing, at least for the first month, so your natural immunities can be passed to your child.Or, consider a combination of breastfeeding and formula feeding. If you're nursing, it's okay to give your baby formula once a day as long as your breast milk supply is well established, which usually happens within a month of giving birth. Some women supplement this way because formula feeding gives them a break (especially in the middle of the night) and lets their partner help feed the baby.That said, exclusive formula feeding  either right from the start or after a period of nursing  is also a healthy way to feed your baby. Formula even has some vitamins and other nutrients that breastfed babies have to get from supplements, like vitamin D.If you're concerned about your choice, try to separate the medical facts from the political and cultural rhetoric. Your child's doctor will work with you to make sure your baby is getting all the nutrients she needs and chart her growth to make sure she's growing well. In the end, the most important thing you can do for your baby is love and nurture her  and that includes feeding her whichever way you choose.There are plenty of reasons women choose to formula-feed. Among them are having a baby with a poor sucking reflex (common in premature babies), prolonged mother-infant separation, painful nursing, the fear that your baby isn't getting enough milk, the need to return to work, a health problem that requires medication that's not safe for a nursing infant, and a desire to let other family members help feed the baby.Which type of formula should I use?Most formulas are made from cow's milk or soybeans. There are also specialized formulas for babies who are allergic to milk or soy proteins, and for babies who are premature or have a low birth weight. Any formula you choose should be iron-fortified to prevent anemia. To find out more about choosing the right formula for your baby, see our article and talk to your baby's doctor.Why can't I just feed my baby cow's milk?Never feed your infant cow's milk. It's just not recommended until after your baby's first birthday because it doesn't have the proper nutrients in the right proportions for a growing infant. It can also cause digestive trouble.Find out more about when to transition your child to regular cow's milk and how to make the switch.What are follow-up formulas, and should I switch to one?Follow-up formulas are specifically designed for babies 4 to 12 months old who are already eating some solids. Follow-up formulas contain more calcium, iron, protein, and calories than infant formulas.Most babies don't need follow-up formula. Doctors encourage parents to introduce solid food (baby cereal, pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables) to their babies at 4 to 6 months, rather than fill them up with formula.Still, it depends on the individual child. Babies with food allergies, those who are very sensitive to different foods, and those with a history of poor growth may benefit from follow-up formula. Talk to your doctor about what's best for your baby.I'd like to supplement breast milk with formula. How should I do it?Lactation consultants suggest waiting to introduce a bottle until the baby is 4 weeks old. By then, breastfeeding is usually well established, but your baby's not yet likely to resist a new kind of nipple. (Nursing and taking a bottle require different types of sucking.)It's best to have someone else give the first bottle because your baby can smell you and your milk and may refuse to take a bottle if you're nearby.If you plan to use formula for occasional feedings, don't offer more than one bottle every 24 hours. Otherwise, your milk production could slow down. If you're returning to work soon and plan to have your caregiver give your baby formula while you're away and nurse when you're home, ease into it by replacing one feeding with a bottle every three to four days.Get more tips on supplementing with formula.Show sources Hide sources AAP.

10 ways to make your pregnancy pounds pay off,https://www.babycenter.com/0_10-ways-to-make-your-pregnancy-pounds-pay-off_10396238.bc,"Pregnancy gives you a very important reason to gain weight: To nourish a baby and keep yourself healthy, you'll need additional calories, nutrients, vitamins, and minerals.(You can find out how much food you need every day in our article on meal planning during pregnancy.)But what's the healthiest way to do that, while maximizing nutrition and avoiding the bad stuff?1. Dont cut out fatsThe key is to choose nutritious ones. After all, the fat in a doughnut and the fat in an avocado are not created equal. As much as you can, pick healthy fats; the avocado's monounsaturated fats are a lot better than the saturated or trans fats found in a doughnut or pastryand it has vitamins C and K, as well.Eating healthy fats will have a positive impact that lasts beyond pregnancy, says Bridget Swinney, a registered dietitian in Texas and author ofEating Expectantly: Practical Advice for Healthy Eating Before, During, and After Pregnancy.""Your body will store some of the fat you eat to use in your breast milk. For the healthiest breast milk, limit saturated and trans fats now and while you're breastfeeding,"" Swinney says. Find out more about healthy fats pregnant women need and where to get them.2. Choose foods that pack a nutritional punchEat foods that give you more for every bite, like yogurt, which contains calcium, potassium, and protein, and is also a powerful source of probioticsthe good bacteria that helps keep digestion healthy.Other great picks are berries like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and cranberries. These are rich in vitamin C and fiber, but they're also packed with antioxidants, which help fight inflammation.Mushrooms are another nutritional star, says Swinney.""Mushrooms are a good source of minerals like selenium and copper, and they're also the only natural vegetarian source of vitamin D,"" Swinney says. ""Some contain the daily value in one serving.""Find out more about the best foods for pregnant women.3. Eat the whole spectrumTo make sure you're getting a broad range of nutrients, try to load up on colorful fruits and vegetables as often as possible.Try dark green kale, ruby red strawberries, and orange squash. Swinney encourages pregnant women to aim for three cups of vegetables and two cups of fruit each day.In fact, fruits and veggies should fill half your plate at every meal, according to new guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).(Want more info? The USDA offers a customized eating plan for moms-to-be that corresponds to your stage of pregnancy.)And while it's often true that the deeper the color, the more nutritious the veggie, that's not always the case. Vegetables such as cauliflower and cabbage are full of nutrients.So are white potatoes, which often get a bad rap. A medium potato has only 110 calories and provides more than a third of the daily vitamin C needed during pregnancy, plus 2 grams of fiber. (Sweet potatoes are extremely rich in beta carotene but boast less vitamin C.) All the more reason to bake one up, add toppings, and call it lunch or dinner.The dietary danger lurks in the serving size and the preparation: its news to no one that French fries  whether they're made from sweet or white potatoes  are high in fat and saltnot too mention temptingly easy to overindulge in.Nutty brown also counts; try whole wheat breads or pasta to maximize your nutrients. If youre already used to brown rice and whole-grain oatmeal, consider trying some new grains like bulgur and millet.4. Pair foods to maximize their goodnessSome foods are even better together. No, we're not talking about peanut butter and jelly (though that can be a tasty, healthy snack), but rather about foods that enhance each other's nutritional benefits.For example, foods rich in vitamin C  like citrus fruit, melon, berries, broccoli, cabbage, and tomatoes help your body absorb the iron from beans, grains, and eggs. So spoon salsa on your scrambled eggs or black bean tacos, or serve them with a side of melon or steamed broccoli.Or try pairing a prebiotic food with a probiotic food to boost the effects of both. Prebiotics (such as bananas, artichokes, asparagus, onions, and whole grains) encourage the growth of healthy bacteria in your gut, while probiotics like yogurt, kefir, aged cheese, sauerkraut, miso, and tempeh contain gut-healthy bacteria alreadyso one supports the other. Some winning combinations: yogurt with banana, artichoke hearts drizzled with a Greek yogurt sauce, or diced asparagus in miso soup.5. Cook from scratch when you canBy making meals at home, you can control the ingredients, and you'll wind up with better quality, often for less money. For example, many store-bought salad dressings use less expensive  and less healthy  oils than those you'd use at home.One idea: Make your own olive oil-based salad dressing to pour over a spinach or kale salad, then add avocado. Olive oil and avocado help your body absorb more lutein, which is important for eye and brain health, and beta carotene, important for the immune system.Many people are intimidated by cooking fish, but it can be a snap. Cover a slab of salmon with some pesto sauce or olive oil, salt, and pepper, and cook in the microwave for about 3 to 5 minutes or the oven for 12 to 15 minutes at 450 degrees. Salmon has omega-3 fats that help build your baby's brain and eyes.You can also make sweets like quick breads or cookies at home using healthier fats (canola oil or mashed avocado) and less sugar. (You can usually cut the sugar in a recipe by a third without noticing.) Try replacing some of the oil with high-fiber foods like black beans or prunes. And sneak in some extra nutrients by adding dried fruits and nuts.6. Rethink your drinksIt's important to stay hydrated during pregnancy, but how you do it can make a big difference. Steer clear of soda, sweet tea, and sugary fruit drinks and juices  they're full of empty calories. Water, milk, or vegetable juice are better choices.Drinking one-hundred100 percent juice (without added sweeteners) can be a great way to get one serving of fruit. Juice has a lot of natural sugars and calories, though, so limit your intake to one cup a day.Pick juices with powerful nutrients. Cranberry juice may help prevent urinary tract infections; apple juice contains phytochemicals linked to improved respiratory health; and orange juice is rich in vitamin C, potassium, and folic acid, which are important for your babys development.If plain water doesn't appeal, try a spritzer: Pour sparkling water into a glass and add a splash of fruit juice or pureed fruit (watermelon and mint tastes great).7. Embrace eggsThey're cheap, easy to prepare, and great for your baby. A large egg is roughly 80 calories, over half of which comes from the yolk. Speaking of which, if you've been an egg-white omelet aficionada until now, pregnancy is a time to rethink that. Both the egg yolk and the white contain healthy lean protein.And yolks are packed with vitamins such as choline, which is important for your baby's developing brain  and may help your memory, too.""When I was pregnant, I added a hard-boiled egg a day as a snack,"" says Jessica Corwin, a registered dietitian and community nutrition educator for Spectrum Health in Michigan. ""Eggs might contain a little cholesterol, but they're full of nutrients and an easy, affordable way to get choline into your diet.""8. Break out the beansPacked with protein and dirt cheap, beans can be a meal unto themselves. To make a big pot, soak dried beans overnight in water; drain the next day; add water to cover; and toss in garlic, onion, and spices; then cook until tender. Add them to a salad, combine them with rice, or team with a portion of meat for a well-balanced meal.""Beans have protein, fiber, carbs, and no fat unless it's added,"" says Eleana Kaidanian, a New York registered dietitian who counsels pregnant women. ""They have great iron content and they're really filling.""Legumes include beans, peas, and lentils, and there are so many varieties, you can't get tired of them,"" says Kaidanian.9. Choose treats that add valueBreak out the dark chocolate. Though it does contain sugar and fat, it shouldn't be on your ""unhealthy"" list, says nutritionist Bridget Swinney. ""Chocolate, especially dark chocolate, contains antioxidants that may actually help blood pressure,"" she says.Still, Swinney advises sticking to small amounts. She recommends 1 to 2 tablespoons of cocoa or half an ounce of dark chocolate a day. (That's about what you'd get in a cup of hot cocoa, three dark Hershey Kisses, or one and a half Dove Promises.)Another healthy splurge: dark chocolate-covered almonds. Just 11 contain 25 percent of your vitamin E for the day.Or go for frozen yogurt or low-fat ice cream, which contains protein and calcium. Punch up the nutrition by topping it with sliced banana and slivered almonds.10. Snack smartSnacking and pregnancy are a good fit: Having smaller, more-frequent meals or snacks can help ward off morning sickness, indigestion, and heartburn. And healthy snacking provides a steady stream of nutrients to your developing baby.But don't let regular snacking morph into all-day eating. Brush up on how much extra you need to be eating, which may be a lot less than you think.""To stick to a well-balanced weight, pregnant women don't have to eat much more,"" says Ashley Roman, director of the NYU Maternal Fetal Care Center.You can often get the extra calories you need in one healthy snack  yogurt with fruit, cheese and crackers, apples and peanut butter. ""Not a hot fudge sundae,"" Roman says.Bonnie Rochman is a health writer who is at work on a book about how genetics is reshaping childhood."
Baby-led weaning: An alternative approach to starting your baby on solids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-led-weaning-an-alternative-approach-to-starting-your-ba_10419206.bc,"What is baby-led weaning?Baby-led weaning (BLW) is an alternative method for starting your baby on solids. Instead of spoon-feeding him mushy cereals and purees, you put large chunks of soft food directly on the highchair tray or table, and let your baby grasp the food and feed himself. It's called ""baby-led"" because you let your baby pick up the food and eat at his own pace, instead of controlling how much and how quickly he eats.This technique first gained popularity when public health nurse Gill Rapley coined the term ""baby-led weaning"" in the United Kingdom about a decade ago. (There, weaning means starting your baby on solid food. It has nothing to do with stopping breastfeeding, as it does in the United States.)Just as with traditional spoon-feeding, your baby will continue to get most of his nutrition from breast milk or formula until he gets used to eating solid food (usually around his first birthday).Check out our videos to see how it's done:Baby-led weaning: Signs your baby is readyBaby-led weaning: Getting startedBaby-led weaning: 9 great finger foodsBaby-led weaning: Is gagging normal?What are the advantages of baby-led weaning?Proponents say BLW has numerous benefits, including:Healthy eating: BLW may produce healthier eaters than spoon-feeding because babies get to choose how much to eat. Learning to regulate their food intake may help prevent obesity. And allowing babies to explore different food flavors and textures may make them more adventurous eaters, meaning they're more likely to try new foods and eat a broad range of foods as they grow up.Skill development: By trying to grasp and eat chunks of food, infants practice eye-hand coordination. BLW allows older babies to practice picking up small pieces of food using their index finger and thumb, using a fine motor skill known as the ""pincer grip."" They also may learn how to feed themselves and chew and swallow more quickly than spoon-fed babies.Less stress for parents: BLW can be less time-consuming if you're making your own baby food because you don't have the extra step of pureeing the food, and you don't have to sit and spoon-feed your baby. It also makes it easier for babies to participate in family mealtimes because they can eat many of the same foods as the rest of the family.More enjoyable for babies: When babies get to select which piece of food they want to eat from a variety in front of them, and eat it at their own pace, they may enjoy eating more than if they are spoon-fed by an adult.Is there evidence to support these claims?Very few scientific studies have been done on BLW so far, but existing research suggests BLW may help prevent obesity and encourage babies' participation in family mealtimes.For example, one small study in the United Kingdom found that children who started solids using BLW tended to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than spoon-fed kids. Spoon-fed children had a greater chance of being overweight and were more likely to favor sweet food.Another small study done in New Zealand found babies introduced to solid foods using BLW were more likely than spoon-fed babies to share mealtimes with their families, which may help kids develop healthy eating habits. The BLW babies also tended to eat food the rest of the family ate, while spoon-fed babies were more likely to eat commercially prepared baby food. Eating the same food as other family members may encourage healthier long-term eating patterns, the authors said.Are there downsides to baby-led weaning?Potentially, yes. Researchers note BLW could result in nutritional deficiencies for some babies. For example, the BLW babies in the United Kingdom study mentioned above were more likely than spoon-fed babies to be significantly underweight.This could be because BLW babies may not ingest much food in the first weeks or months. (And it may be more of a problem for babies whose manual dexterity is developing more slowly than average.) Parents also tend to offer mostly fruits and vegetables, which are easy to grasp but don't contain many calories.BLW babies may also end up deficient in iron, especially if they don't drink formula, because they don't get the iron-fortified cereal that most spoon-fed babies are given.One small study suggested that parents using BLW who offer at least one iron-rich food (such as beef, chicken, or hummus) at each meal could increase their baby's iron intake.Another small study raised other nutritional questions. It found BLW infants ate more fat and saturated fat, and less iron, zinc, and vitamin b12 than spoon-fed babies. The authors concluded that if families decide to follow BLW, they should make sure they give infants healthy, nutrient-rich foods.Can baby-led weaning increase my baby's risk of choking?One big concern about giving babies whole food to eat is whether 6-month-old babies are developmentally ready to chew and swallow chunks of food and whether these chunks  even when they're soft  are choking hazards.The American Academy of Pediatricians (AAP) doesn't have an official opinion on BLW. But the organization warns that choking is a leading cause of death among young children and recommends serving babies only mashed, pureed, or ground-up food when they're first starting solids.According to the AAP, your baby is ready for finger foods once she can sit up and bring her hands or other objects to her mouth. To avoid choking, the AAP says you should make sure any food you give your baby is soft, easy to swallow, and cut into small pieces. This is unlike BLW, in which babies are given large chunks of food.A recent study compared a modified version of BLW (designed to reduce choking risk) to traditional spoon-feeding, and the results showed BLW is no more likely to cause choking than traditional spoon-feeding. In this study, 206 moms were randomly assigned to either the modified baby-led weaning technique or spoon-feeding group.Although neither feeding approach demonstrated a greater choking risk, 35 percent of infants in both groups choked on food at least once during the study. The authors believe this shows that all parents need to watch their children carefully at mealtimes and know what to do if they start to choke.What about gagging?Whether they're being spoon-fed or trying BLW, many babies gag when they first start solids, and this can be disconcerting or even frightening.Experts say gagging is a normal reflex babies have as they learn to eat solids. Gagging brings food forward into your baby's mouth so he can chew it some more first or try to swallow a smaller amount. Your baby should gag less often as he develops and learns to regulate the amount of food he swallows.If your baby gags a lot, try to remember it's a temporary stage that your baby will get through.How can you tell if your baby is choking? Choking means your child's airway is partially or completely blocked, which prevents breathing. Here's how to recognize the difference between gagging and choking:A child who is gagging may push his tongue forward or out of his mouth and do a retching movement to try to bring food forward. His eyes may water. He may cough or even vomit. Let your child continue to cough because that's the most effective way to resolve the problem.

See what normal gagging looks like and find tips to prevent choking. See all videosA child who is choking is unable to cry, cough, or gasp. He may make odd noises or no sound at all while opening his mouth. You may need to do back blows or chest thrusts to dislodge the blockage.When can I start baby-led weaning?Most babies are ready to start BLW when they're about 6 months old, though some may need more time.It's likely that your baby is ready to start BLW if she can sit up without support and shows signs of readiness, such as being interested in your food (or even reaching for it), grabbing and putting objects in her mouth, and making chewing motions while watching you eat.Keep in mind that BLW may not be right for babies with special needs or who are unable to pick up and chew food on their own. Talk with your baby's doctor before trying BLW, especially if:Your baby has special needs and can't chew very well.Your baby has difficulty picking up food and moving it to her mouth.Your baby was born prematurely.How do I start baby-led weaning?If your baby shows signs of readiness, and his doctor says it's okay for your baby to try BLW, start by taking an infant first aid class to make sure you know what to do in case your baby starts choking. (This is important no matter what method you use to feed your baby. A baby can choke on any small item.)Here are some tips for getting started with BLW:For the first couple of months, schedule BLW sessions when your baby isn't hungry. In the beginning, the focus should be on play and exploration. It will take your baby time to learn to eat solids, and in the meantime, he'll still be getting his nutrition primarily from breast milk or formula.BLW is messy. Protect your baby's clothes with a large bib or smock. You may also want to protect your own clothes by putting a mat or newspaper under your baby's highchair for easy cleanup.Make sure you or another adult is watching your baby carefully during meals and knows what to do if your baby starts choking.Make sure your baby is sitting upright in his highchair, not leaning back.Offer your baby soft or well-cooked food cut into sticks or strips that are at least as long as his fist, not bite-size pieces. He will likely try to clasp the food in his fists and smash it into his mouth at first. Over time, he'll learn to grip the food between his thumb and forefinger.Don't offer your baby foods that can pose choking hazards, such as nuts, grapes, popcorn, and foods cut into coins, including sausages and hot dogs.Make sure your baby's food passes the ""squish test"" by checking whether you can squish it on the roof of your mouth with your tongue. That means no raw vegetables and no hard raw fruit (such as apples) or citrus fruit (unless each segment is peeled). The exception is pieces of food that are large and fibrous enough that small pieces don't break off when sucked or chewed. So for example, soft-cooked meat is okay, but cheese sticks are not.Put food directly on the highchair tray or table in front of your baby. (Bowls and plates will just end up on the floor.)Introduce new foods one at a time. Just as with spoon-feeding, it's a good idea to wait two or three days after introducing a new food before trying the next one. That way, if your baby has an allergic reaction, you'll know which food probably caused it.Eat as a family whenever possible. Babies learn to eat by observing and imitating other family members. Family mealtimes also make your baby to feel like part of the group.As with many other parenting approaches, what works for some families won't necessarily work for yours. Some families strictly follow the BLW approach, while others do a combination of BLW and spoon-feeding. For example, you could spoon-feed your baby purees and mashed food sometimes, but allow him to eat finger foods (like the ones listed below) by himself at other times.What are some good foods for BLW?Some foods that are good to use with BLW include:Well-cooked vegetable sticks, including steamed carrots, zucchini, sweet potatoes, and beetsFood with interesting shapes and textures, such as steamed broccoli and cauliflower florets, and chunks of soft avocadoSoft, ripe fruits, including banana, papaya, pear, kiwi, melon, and soft-cooked appleSoft meatballs or large strips of poached chickenPasta in a shape that's easy to grab, like fusilli or penne. Try whole grain or vegetable varieties.Rice rolled into ballsLentil pattiesSalt-free rice cakesAs your baby progresses, she can start learning to dip her food chunks into hummus, yogurt, and guacamole.How can I be sure my baby is getting enough food?It takes babies a while to get used to solid food, so to make sure he gets adequate nutrition, it's important to continue breastfeeding or bottle-feeding your baby during his first year, even after he starts eating solid food. (Your baby's main source of nutrients should be breast milk or formula until about 1 year of age, no matter what else he eats.) As he learns to eat solid food, he'll need less breast milk or formula.Your child's doctor will keep track of your baby's growth at well-child visits, so talk with her if you're concerned about how much your baby eats or weighs.What experts say about baby-led weaningTamara Melton, MS, RDN, LD, Spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Atlanta, GAI generally feel positive about BLW. I think it's fine for parents to try it as long as the baby continues to receive breast milk or formula until at least 1 year of age.My older daughter did very well with BLW. She loved eating all kinds of foods and had no problem feeding herself soft-cooked fruits, veggies, and yogurt. My younger daughter refused to consume anything but breast milk. She had (and continues to have, at 3 years old) strong preferences about textures and a huge aversion to getting her hands dirty or wet. So BLW didn't work so well for her.BLW saved me time with one daughter, since I didn't have to take the extra step to pure the food. But for the other one, it was stressful and confusing. It was hard for me to figure out what was causing my younger daughter's aversions. So I would say parents should be flexible and be willing to go with whatever works best for each child.Jatinder Bhatia, MD, FAAP, Past chair of the AAP Committee on Nutrition, Chiefof the division of neonatology, Georgia Health Sciences University, Augusta, GAWe have lots of cultural myths about the best way to feed babies, and we're starting to discover that they're myths. There's no scientific rationale for a particular method of feeding.There's no problem with BLW, although there are some cautions. Make sure the food is developmentally appropriate for your child. Stay nearby and watch your child eat. Food for 6-month-olds doesn't need to be pureed, but it should be the texture, consistency, and size that the child can handle.For example, don't give a baby sticky foods like peanut butter or hard foods like raw carrot. (A very soft cooked carrot would be fine.) Soft finger foods are good. Even if a baby doesn't have many teeth, she can still gum foods.Also, it's still a good idea to introduce only one new food at a time for five to seven days to make sure child isn't allergic. And offer a food multiple times before determining that the baby doesn't like that food.What parents say about baby-led weaningIt worked for us""[Baby-led weaning was] one of the best decisions we made with our daughter. She is a fantastic eater and eats a great variety of food. I also believe it made her a great restaurant eater. We always got compliments on how well-behaved she was, and people were always shocked to see a 7-month-old feeding herself in a restaurant."" Michele""BLW worked great for us. I have never felt that because of BLW my son wasn't eating healthy foods. In fact, I thought the opposite because he wasn't getting anything processed. As far as controlled amounts, my son definitely got less food by feeding himself than if I were feeding him, and he didn't know how to say 'no more.'"" Heather""We started baby-led weaning with my little guy when he was 6 months old, and we have never looked back. We were really nervous at first about him choking, but in the four months we've been doing this, he hasn't choked once! I'm a huge advocate for BLW. My son will eat anything that I put in front of him and is so excited to try new foods."" Mandy""I love baby-led weaning, but I agree that it's probably not a magic bullet. I like it because it has freed up a lot of time for me. (I don't have to sit and spoon-feed at every meal.) And it allowed my son to be independent in choosing and eating food. It worked for us because my son was developmentally normal, at a normal weight, and had good manual dexterity, and also because I was able to nurse him quite a lot well past one year."" LauraIt didn't work for us""I couldn't do BLW with my son because he has special needs, and at 13 months only started feeding himself Cheerios with pincer grasp. He also doesn't register being hungry, so if I waited for him to feed himself something he would wither away."" Aly""My oldest had an aversion to getting her hands messy, and never, ever put things in her mouth. If we had chosen to do baby-led weaning, she wouldn't have eaten anything solid until she was almost 3.""

How to eat when you're trying to conceive,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-eat-when-youre-trying-to-conceive_1460692.bc,"If you're trying to get pregnant, practicing good eating habits now can help you have a healthy pregnancy once you conceive.""What you eat affects everything from your blood to your cells to your hormones,"" says Cynthia Stadd, a nutrition specialist at the Berkley Center for Reproductive Wellness in New York City.But no matter how balanced your diet is, it's still important to take prenatal vitamins to reduce the risk of having a baby with neural tube defects. Most experts recommend that all women start taking folic acid at least a month before trying to get pregnant.Read on for more tips about eating a healthy diet while trying to conceive.Curb caffeineIt's unclear whether caffeine can affect fertility. There's some evidence that very high consumption  more than 500 milligrams a day, or about three to four 8-ounce cups of coffee depending on the strength of the brew  might interfere with fertility. But experts generally agree that low to moderate caffeine consumption (less than 300 milligrams a day, or about two 8-ounce cups of coffee) shouldn't make it harder for you to get pregnant.What does your OB-GYN want you to know before getting pregnant?

See all videosBecause no one knows for sure how caffeine impacts fertility, some experts suggest lowering your caffeine intake even more or giving it up entirely, especially if you're having difficulty conceiving or if you're undergoing in vitro fertilization.Once you're pregnant, experts recommend getting no more than 200 milligrams of caffeine a day (a little less than a 12-ounce cup of coffee) because higher amounts have been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage.Read more aboutcaffeine and fertility, including the amount in other beverages and tips for cutting backOvulation CalculatorFind out when you're likely to ovulate  and boost your chances of conceiving.Eat lots of fruits and vegetablesThink of produce as Mother Nature's multivitamin. Fruits and vegetables deliver a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, and getting enough of certain nutrients is especially important before you conceive.For example, veggies like spinach, romaine lettuce, asparagus, and broccoli are high in the B vitamin folate. (Folic acid is the synthetic form.) Eating foods rich in folate during preconception and pregnancy can help prevent neural tube birth defects, such as spina bifida. Produce that's high in vitamin C  such as citrus fruit, strawberries, broccoli, and tomatoes  can help your body absorb iron more easily, and iron is an important mineral for women who become pregnant. (See ""Pump up your iron intake"" below.)In general, choose fruits and vegetables in a range of colors to get the most nutritional bang for your buck. (Eating a produce ""rainbow"" gives you a wider variety of nutrients.) Choose fishSeafood is the best source of omega-3 fatty acids, and according to some scientists, these essential fats may have a positive effect on fertility. Research suggests that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids may help regulate ovulation, improve egg quality, and even delay aging of the ovaries.Omega-3s are also important for a baby's brain and eye development and could have many other pregnancy-related benefits. These include lowering your risk ofpreterm birth, reducing your chance of preeclampsia, and easingdepression.On the other hand, you've probably also heard that some types of fish contain contaminants such as mercury. In high doses, this metal is harmful to a baby's developing brain and nervous system.The good news is that not all fish contain a lot of mercury. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that women trying to conceive can safely eat up to 12 ounces (roughly two or three servings) a week of fish like canned light tuna, salmon, shrimp, cod, tilapia, and catfish.However, the FDA advises limiting white (albacore) tuna and completely avoiding fresh or frozen swordfish, tilefish, king mackerel, and shark because these have the highest mercury levels.You can take fish oil supplements if you don't like seafood, but first talk to your doctor about which brand to buy and how much you should take.Read our article oneating fish when you're trying to conceivefor more advice on mercury and omega-3s.Pump up your iron intakeFill your body's iron reserves before you get pregnant, especially if your periods are heavy. According to Sam Thatcher, a reproductive endocrinologist and author ofMaking a Baby: Everything You Need to Know to Get Pregnant, ""Bleeding every month is a constant source of iron depletion.""Make sure to get enough iron now  once you're expecting, it's difficult for your body to maintain its iron level because your developing baby uses up your stores of the mineral. (Pregnant women need double the amount of iron they needed before pregnancy.)Too little iron at conception not only can affect your baby, it can also put you at risk for iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy and after you give birth (especially if you lose a lot of blood during delivery). Anemia causes your red blood cells to fall below normal and saps your energy.If you don't eat much red meat, or if you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, your healthcare provider may recommend that you take a prenatal vitamin containing extra iron. And to be on the safe side, ask your healthcare provider to test you for anemia at your preconception checkup. Eat whole grainsA woman trying to conceive should eat as many nutrient-rich foods as possible, and whole grains are a great place to start, says nutrition specialist Stadd.The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food guidelines recommend that you make at least half of the grains you eat each day whole grains (such as bran cereal, oatmeal, brown rice, or whole wheat bread). Refined carbohydrates (like white bread, pasta, and white rice) won't directly lower your chance of getting pregnant, but they do shortchange your body because the refining process strips grains of key nutrients such as fiber, some B vitamins, and iron.Note: If you havepolycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS), the most common cause of infertility in women, pay extra attention to the types of carbs you eat. PCOS is a hormonal imbalance that can get worse when insulin levels in the bloodstream surge, and refined carbohydrates are a main cause of insulin spikes.Mark Leondires, fertility specialist and medical director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of Connecticut, explains that when women with PCOS eat too many refined carbohydrates, insulin flows into the blood, feeds back to the ovaries, and can lead to irregular ovulation.Avoid alcoholAn occasional beer or glass of wine probably won't hurt your odds of conceiving, but having two or more drinks a day can. Moderate drinking can also increase your risk of miscarriage. You may want to skip alcohol completely when you're trying to conceive because it can be hard to tell exactly when you get pregnant, and alcohol can harm a developing baby.For nonalcoholic alternatives, see our list of thebest ""virgin"" drinks.Be aware of listeriaListeriais a bacterium that can contaminate lunchmeats, soft cheeses, and unpasteurized dairy products. Pregnant women are more likely than other healthy adults to get sick from eating contaminated food, and the infection caused by listeria (listeriosis)can cause amiscarriageearly in the first trimester  possibly before you even know you're pregnant.To kill listeria, heat high-risk foods in the microwave until they're steaming hot. To reduce bacteria growth on leftovers, set the refrigerator's temperature to 40 degrees or less. Toss any food that's been at room temperature for more than two hours.Do not eat these foods:raw fish and sushi, refrigerated smoked seafood (like lox), soft cheesemade from unpasteurized (raw) milk, other unpasteurized dairy products, and refrigerated pt or meat spreads. (Canned or shelf-stable spreads are safe to eat.) Choose other proteinsProtein is a critical part of a healthy diet, but according to the USDA, many Americans rely too heavily on beef, pork, and chicken to get their daily amount. In a study of 18,555 women, experts at Harvard Medical School found that those who included one daily serving of vegetable protein  such as nuts, beans, peas, soybeans or tofu  were less likely to have infertility due to ovulation problems.More research is needed on the link to fertility, but because vegetable proteins are usually lower in fat and calories than steak or fried chicken, including them in your meal plans is both good for you and a great way to maintain a healthy weight.To get a personalized nutrition plan that includes the amount of protein, grains, and produce you should eat daily, try the USDA's SuperTracker tool.What about hisdiet?When it comes to fertility and diet, men don't get a free pass. Lisa Mazzullo, an ob-gyn and assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, recommends that fathers-to-be take a daily multivitamin that contains zinc and selenium for at least three months before conception. Studies suggest these minerals aid in healthy sperm development.Why start so early? The sperm your partner ejaculates today was actually created more than two months ago. It takes about 74 days for sperm to fully develop and benefit from the supplementation.""Genetic preparation is going on during sperm development, so that's pretty heavy stuff,"" says Amy Ogle, a registered dietitian in San Diego, California, and coauthor ofBefore Your Pregnancy: A 90-Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception.Learn more:Dietary changes men can make to boost fertilityFolic acid: Why you need it before and during pregnancyPrenatal vitamins: Why they're so importantEating fish when you're trying to conceive: How to avoid mercury and still get your omega-3sUSDA SuperTracker tool: Get your personalized nutrition planShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

Chase Lapine thought her child's adventurous palate was the result of good parenting. Then her second daughter entered the picture and the term picky eater entered her vocabulary.Childhood food memory: ""I spent many a night in front of a cold bowl of spinach. That scarred me for life. To this day, I despise spinach. I can only eat it if it's hidden in something else.""Food lessons: The challenges of feeding her own picky eater, youngest daughter Samantha, prompted Chase Lapine to develop the recipes for her best-selling book, which sings the praises of concealing nutrition-packed, so-called superfoods like spinach, sweet potatoes, and blueberries  in foods lots of kids love, like brownies, French toast, and spaghetti sauce. ""I started sneaking as a last resort,"" admits Chase Lapine, former publisher of Eating Well magazine. ""But it gives me peace of mind.""Visit Missy's website: thesneakychef.comThe Renegade Lunch LadyAnn Cooper doesn't have kids of her own, but she feeds thousands of school-age children every day as the Director of Food Services for the Boulder Valley School District in Colorado.

""If you turn your nose up at certain foods, like broccoli, you can't expect your child to try it either.""Childhood food memory: ""In the summer, I used to go with my grandfather to catch flounder and lobster  I grew up on the East Coast  and then we'd pick his home-grown tomatoes. It wasn't high cuisine, but we ate local, fresh, healthy real food.""Food lessons: Cooper hasn't always served school food  she's also cooked for the likes of Hillary Clinton and the Grateful Dead. Cooper firmly believes that processed, trans-fat and sugar-filled foods have no place on a school lunch menu. So when she took over the Berkeley public school cafeterias three years ago, she nixed junky chicken nuggets, burgers, and fries. Instead, she serves meals made from scratch, brimming with seasonal, local, and organic fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Perhaps her biggest hit? The self-serve salad bar.

How to handle a picky eater (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-handle-a-picky-eater-ages-5-to-8_66873.bc,"Why is my child such a picky eater?By school age, most children are getting over their fear of trying new foods and their need to constantly assert their independence. Still, an occasional food jag  when your child insists on eating the same foods at every meal while turning up his nose at anything new  is no cause for alarm.Keep in mind that this age group still appreciates the familiar, whether it's a regular bedtime routine or their peanut butter sandwich cut on the diagonal. And while your child probably isn't still saying ""No!"" just to assert himself, he still appreciates having some control over his life, including what foods he eats. Your child probably doesn't like having much attention paid to his eating habits, so keep your approach low key. Whatever you do, don't pressure or bribe your child to eat because you'll only run into resistance.Tips for introducing new foods to a picky eaterYour child has an innate sense of how much food his body needs to grow and be healthy, and it's up to him to decide what he's going to eat. The best thing you can do is to provide a wide variety of healthy foods in a positive, relaxed environment so that mealtimes will be enjoyable for everyone. Here are some specific tips on how to handle a picky eater:Provide a variety of good foods for your child to eat at each meal. Your grade-schooler may be happy to try new things, or it may take numerous exposures to a new food before he's willing to give it a go. So be patient. When you do offer a new food, simply place it on the dinner table with everything else, and don't make a big deal about it. Don't put it right on your child's plate; let him choose it for himself. He might dig right in, or he may warm up to it eventually, after seeing you eat it a few times.Don't give your grade-schooler too many options at mealtime. If you say ""It's dinnertime. What would you like to eat?"" your child will probably choose something familiar, and he'll seem like a picky eater, says Hudson. However, if you say, ""Here's dinner,"" he'll have to choose from among the foods you're offering. Of course, you won't want to offer an entire meal of unfamiliar foods because your child simply won't eat them. Instead, always offer a meal that includes at least one thing you know your child likes.When presenting new foods, don't offer them in large quantities. If by some miracle your child is willing to try a new food, give him just a taste and let him ask for more before putting a whole serving on his plate. This way he won't feel overwhelmed, and it won't seem like a waste of food to you if he doesn't eat it. And try to present new foods when he's hungry  like slices of mango when he has the afternoon munchies.Keep in mind that some children's palates are more sensitive than others', and they simply won't like the texture, color, or taste of some foods. That's why a child might claim to dislike a food he has never even tried. Likewise, some children may reject a food because it reminds them of a time when they were sick, or because it has some other negative association. If your grade-schooler complains that a particular food will make him sick, stop serving that food for a while. You can always try again when he's a little older.If you send a packed lunch to school, give your child some choices about what goes in it, but also include a fun surprise now and then. An exciting lunch is more likely to be eaten.Whenever possible, involve your grade-schooler in food decisions and preparations, including shopping and making meals and snacks. (And if he can help you grow some of the family's produce in the yard, so much the better!) This will give him a sense of control over his diet. And he'll be more likely to eat something that he's chosen or helped make for himself. (This works best if you let your child choose from a small selection of foods you've already picked out rather than just asking what he wants for dinner.) Make fun, healthful treats together, like yogurt-and-fruit banana splits or smoothiesLook for ways to boost the nutritional value of the foods your grade-schooler enjoys. Put some tuna or ham on his grilled cheese, or meat or tofu in his spaghetti sauce, for example.Teach your grade-schooler (without lecturing) about good nutrition. Put a food chart on the refrigerator and have him color in the requirements as he meets them each day, and mention nonchalantly that his oatmeal will help him run and jump better at school today.Keep in mind that many children are less picky eaters when they're away from home. So as your child's world expands and he begins attending school, his palate may broaden as well.An extra word about breakfast: Research shows that kids who eat breakfast do better academically and socially at school. So it's worth putting some effort into finding healthy foods that your child will eat before heading out the door in the morning. Be open to foods that aren't traditional breakfast foods  like a peanut butter and jelly sandwich and a glass of milk or an egg taco  if that's what your child prefers. How can I get my child to eat a wider variety of foods?It's unrealistic to expect a grade-schooler to eat a wide range of foods. In the long run, the example you set by serving and enjoying all sorts of healthy foods  at home and on the go  is one of the best ways to help your child learn to eat well. But for now, try to remember that your child's choice to eat only a few foods is just that  his choice, and it's important to let him learn to make his own decisions about food.""A child needs to be in control of what he eats,"" says Nancy Hudson, a registered dietitian at the University of California, Berkeley. If you force a child to eat a food he doesn't like (""You'll sit at the table until you finish your peas""), or more than he wants, you could be setting him up for problems later: Children who are never allowed to make food decisions for themselves (such as deciding when they're full) are at a greater risk for developing eating disorders or becoming obese later in life. What's more, your strategy will almost always backfire because forcing your child to try new foods will only make him more stubborn and less open to trying new things in the future.If your grade-schooler seems to be eating nothing but macaroni and cheese for days on end, don't worry. Start keeping a record of what your child eats  you'll probably find that he's hitting all the major food groups and getting the nutrients he needs over the course of a week. Studies from the American Dietetic Association show that children  even those whose parents consider them ""picky eaters""  generally consume a wide enough variety of foods to meet their nutritional requirements. If you really don't think your child is eating well, you could give your grade-schooler a daily multivitamin.How can I tell whether my child is really getting enough to eat if he's not growing?Don't panic if it seems like your grade-schooler isn't growing fast enough. Children don't always grow at a steady pace, and there will be times when your child doesn't seem to be growing at all. Keep in touch with your doctor if you're concerned, but don't convey your fears to your child. If you're constantly hovering at mealtime, wheedling, cajoling, and counting calories, he's likely to become even more resistant to eating."

Pesticides in your child's food: What you need to know,https://www.babycenter.com/pesticides-in-your-child's-food,"Should I be concerned about pesticides in the food my child eats?Yes. Pesticide residues are often found on produce, and fruits and vegetables are an important part of your child's diet.Pesticides protect crops from damage, which helps keep groceries affordable. But research shows that pesticides also contribute to a wide range of health problems, including cancer, lung disease, reproductive problems, and possibly disorders of the endocrine and immune systems.Animal testing indicates that pesticides can cause permanent changes in brain chemistry that may lead to behavioral disorders, learning disabilities, and even long-term damage to the brain and nervous system.Pesticide exposure can affect your child's health today and in the future. In fact, some effects may not become apparent until later in life.Are children more vulnerable to pesticides than adults are?Yes. Children tend to eat a limited number of foods, which can increase their exposure to specific pesticides. They also eat more food relative to their body weight than adults do.Children may also absorb pesticides more easily. And because their gastrointestinal tract is still developing, their bodies may be less capable of breaking down toxins. Finally, pesticides can block absorption of the nutrients that are vital to healthy growth and development.Keep in mind that eating food isn't the only way your child can come in contact with pesticides: They can also get into drinking water.And if you use pesticides in your home or yard, that's another way your child will be exposed. You can even track pesticides into your home on the soles of your shoes. Then your child can ingest the chemicals if he plays on the floor or puts something from the floor into his mouth, for example.(Pesticides can also cross the placenta, so pregnant women need to take care to minimize exposure.)Aren't there regulations to protect my child from pesticides in food?In the United States, existing regulations are intended to do just that. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets limits on the amount of pesticides that may be used on crops. The limit is based on how toxic a particular pesticide is, how much residue will remain on the crop, and how much of the crop a consumer is likely to eat.The Food Quality Protection Act, passed in 1996, requires that the residue levels of pesticides be safe for babies and children, taking into account children's special sensitivity to pesticides. However, under certain circumstances  like in the case of economic hardship to the farmer  the EPA can authorize the use of pesticides that don't meet safety standards.Some consumer advocacy groups believe that limits on pesticides should be stricter to protect children.While federal regulations have been gradually prohibiting the most dangerous pesticides, more remain in use. In addition, tests have found that some produce contains high levels of pesticides that have long been banned in the United States because these chemicals are still in the soil. And when farmers plant in contaminated soils, they often end up with contaminated produce.The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Pesticide Data Program tests foods for pesticide residues. According to the program's annual report, 64 percent of the fruits and vegetables  both fresh and processed (including baby food)  tested in 2010 had detectable pesticide residues. Low levels were found in eggs, oats, catfish, and drinking water.The USDA emphasizes that these foods are safe to eat. Pesticide residues were largely within the limit deemed acceptable by the EPA. Why do fresh fruits and vegetables have higher residue levels than canned?Foods grown for processing don't need to look appealing, so they normally aren't sprayed as much before harvest. And when foods are processed, they're often peeled, washed, or heated, which removes many pesticide residues.Should I cut down on the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables I feed my toddler?No. Don't let a fear of pesticides make you serve less produce. Fruits and vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet for every child.TheAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)points out that the negative impact of not including fruits and vegetables in your child's diet is far greater than any potential risk from pesticides at the levels found in produce. And there are things you can do to reduce the amount of pesticides your child consumes without restricting produce in his diet.What can I do to protect my child from pesticides in food?These simple steps can greatly reduce the amount of pesticides in your family's food:Peel fruits and vegetables, and remove the outer leaves of vegetables like lettuce and cabbage.Scrub (under running water) all fruits and vegetables that you don't peel. Cleaning products specifically designed to wash produce may also help.Some foods  like strawberries, grapes, broccoli, lettuce, and spinach  are more difficult to wash. Soak these briefly, then rinse.Choose produce without mold, bruising, and decay. These are likely to harbor more pesticides.Trim the fat off meat and remove the skin from poultry. Pesticides (and other environmental chemicals) are often concentrated in the fat and skin of poultry, meat, and fish.Consider buying organic produce, especially foods your child eats a lot of or items on the ""Dirty Dozen"" list (below).Look for locally grown produce. Fruits and vegetables that are grown far away require after-harvest pesticides and waxes to help them survive the long trip. And produce that has to travel is often picked before ripening, which reduces flavor as well as nutrients.Buy produce in season. Although it seems like a treat to buy juicy, red strawberries or tomatoes in the dead of winter, keep in mind that food grown out of season usually comes from another hemisphere. Again, this produce will be picked earlier and probably contain more pesticides.Serve a wide variety of food, especially produce. A varied diet limits repeated consumption of the same pesticide.Avoid the ""Dirty Dozen""When purchasing and preparing produce, keep in mind the Environmental Working Group's ""Dirty Dozen"". This list of the fruits and vegetables with the highest  and lowest  levels of pesticide residue is based on the results from 60,700 tests collected by the USDA and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.As of 2012, these are the 12 fruits and vegetables with thehighestlevels of pesticide residue: apples, celery, sweet bell peppers, peaches, strawberries, imported nectarines, grapes, spinach, lettuce, cucumbers, domestic blueberries, and potatoes.These had thelowestlevels of pesticide residue: onions, sweet corn, pineapple, avocado, cabbage, sweet peas, asparagus, mangoes, eggplant, kiwi, domestic cantaloupe, sweet potatoes, grapefruit, watermelon, and mushrooms.This doesn't mean that you need to ban apples from your shopping cart, but you may not want to rely on them solely to meet your child's fruit requirements. Introduce your child to many different kinds of fruit, including those with low pesticide residue, like kiwi and mangoes. And when you do serve apples that aren't organic, wash them thoroughly or peel them.Is organic produce worth the additional cost?That's up to you. Two recent research reviews found no compelling evidence that organic foods were nutritionally better than nonorganic foods. Eating organically grown foods may reduce your exposure to pesticides, but they have the same nutritional value as their conventionally grown counterparts. Also, some organic meat (like pork) doesn't have the antibacterial properties that make it less likely for bacteria to grow.But a study done in 2008 found that when children switched to a diet of organic food, the amount of pesticides in their urine dropped to nearly undetectable levels. And some studies also show that organic fruits and vegetables actually are more nutritious because they contain more vitamin C and antioxidants, which may help prevent heart disease, than nonorganic fruits and vegetables. For example, one study found that organic strawberries have 8.5 percent more antioxidants than nonorganic fruit.If you choose to buy organic produce, try to buy it directly from the producer  there's a good chance it'll be cheaper. Look for organic growers at your local farmer's market, farm stand, or food cooperative.And if you have the outdoor space, consider growing some of your own organic fruits and vegetables. Gardening is also a great way to teach your child about nutrition."
MyPlate food guide for children,https://www.babycenter.com/0_myplate-food-guide-for-children_72257.bc,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) developed the website ChooseMyPlate.gov to help you plan a healthy diet. MyPlate uses a place setting to illustrate the five food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy products. The website has recipes and sample menus, tips for vegetarians, and suggestions for healthy eating at restaurants. Below are some of the key recommendations.FruitsBuy fruits that are fresh, dried, frozen, and canned (in water or 100 percent juice).Limit fruit juice to no more than 3/4 cup per day. (Juice doesn't contain fiber like fruit does.)Buy fresh fruit in season when it's less expensive and more flavorful.VegetablesEat a variety of colorful vegetables to get the most nutrients.Frozen vegetables are just as nutritious as fresh, so stock up and always have plenty of choices on hand.When using canned vegetables, choose ones labeled ""reduced sodium,"" ""low sodium,"" or ""no salt added.""GrainsChoose whole grains at least half the time.Check the label for the fiber content of whole grain foods and choose the ones that contain at least 10 percent of the daily value.Don't rely on the color of a food to determine whether it's a whole grain  look for ingredients like whole wheat, brown rice, buckwheat, or oatmeal, to be listed first on the label.ProteinsHave seafood as your main protein at least twice a week.Eat beans, peas, or soy products often.Choose the leanest cuts of meat and trim away visible fat.DairySwitch to fat-free or low-fat (1 percent) milk.Cheese can be high in saturated fat, so choose products labeled ""reduced fat"" or ""low-fat.""Regular cream cheese, cream, and butter are not considered part of the dairy food group. They're high in saturated fat and have little or no calcium.Adapted from materials provided by the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion.Read BabyCenter's nutrition guidelines for 2- to 4-year-olds or older kids to learn more about your child's eating habits.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Dealing with a sweet tooth,https://www.babycenter.com/0_dealing-with-a-sweet-tooth_1186683.bc,"If your child pleads for sweets every chance she gets, you may be going crazy trying to figure out how to set limits without making the sugary stuff the forbidden food she will always want. But it's important to figure out how to do this when she's young so she doesn't get into bad habits that will be harder to break later. Try these suggestions from registered dietitian Mindy Hermann.How much is too much?I suggest letting your child have one sweet treat a day  preferably after lunch or as an afternoon snack. Here are some examples of reasonable portion sizes for a young child: One or two pieces of candy, two packaged cookies, or a kid-size ice cream cone. If she whines for more, be firm and be consistent.How should I handle dessert?The best approach is to try not to make it contingent upon what your child eats or use it as a reward or punishment. That only elevates it to a higher level, making it more important than a meal in her eyes. Rather, let it be a normal part of your child's day, and treat it matter-of-factly.What you allow your child to have for dessert might depend on how your child ate at mealtime. If she eats only two bites of chicken and pushes aside the peas, then dessert should be something healthy like fruit. If she eats everything on her plate, then it's okay for her to have a cookie or a piece of cake. If your child asks for more sweets after she's had her dessert, explain that if she's really still hungry, she can have a sandwich, but no more treats.How do I handle incidental or after-school snacks?If you're headed to the market with your toddler in tow, be prepared to buy an on-the-spot snack, but make it something reasonably healthy. Try to shop after a meal, so she's not actually hungry and let her know she can pick out one item only. Since toddlers are too little to choose from an entire aisle of food, pick out two to three items that you find acceptable and that you know she likes, such as animal crackers or graham crackers, and let her choose which one she wants. If she insists on both, explain that she can have one today and the other tomorrow.In general, try to limit the number of treats that you keep at home to one or two types of cookies and one flavor of ice cream, for example. And stock up on different healthy snacks. (Be aware, though, that some healthy-sounding snacks are loaded with sugars, like granola bars laced with chocolate chips and artificially sweetened fruit drinks.)What are some healthy alternatives to sweets?Fresh or dried fruits such as apricots, apples, or pears.Yogurt. Buy it unflavored and mix it with fruit or a spoonful of jam.Smoothies made with real fruit juice, milk or yogurt, and fruit.Cinnamon toast. Spread wheat bread lightly with butter or margarine, sprinkle with cinnamon and a dash of sugar, and toast itGraham crackers or rice cakes, spread with peanut butter or cream cheese. (You may want to wait until your child is three to introduce peanut butter, since peanuts can cause allergic reactions in young children in rare cases.)A bowl of hot cereal with brown sugar or maple syrup on top.

How to get your toddler to eat more healthy food,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-get-your-toddler-to-eat-more-healthy-food_1186688.bc,"Eating well gives your toddler the energy he needs to learn and grow. And it'll help him stay healthy, maintain a healthy weight, and establish good lifelong eating habits. Here are some ways to make nutritious food the most appealing choice:Get your toddler involvedA great way to get your toddler excited about eating well is to get him involved in the family's food decisions. He's too young to help you develop menus, of course, but he'd probably love an excursion to the grocery store.As soon as your child's old enough to manage it, ask him to hold the grocery list for you as you shop. Give him a few choices along the way: Peaches or mangoes? Peas or carrots? Graham crackers or fig bars?Make a habit of selecting one new fruit or vegetable to try each week, keeping in mind that it may take a few tries before your child will actually eat it. Some doctors suggest that parents offer children new foods at least ten times before moving on to other healthy options.Make meals and snacks funEnlist your toddler's help in putting toppings on a pizza or grated cheese on a casserole. Arrange carrot sticks, cherry tomatoes, and bell peppers to look like a face on his plate. Make pancakes in the shape of his initials and cut toast into a heart shape. Offer yogurt for him to dip graham crackers or fruit slices in, and outfit him with a lively placemat and dinnerware.Go to the sourceTake your toddler on an outing to an orchard, community garden, or berry farm so he can see where the food on his plate comes from. At this age he may not make the connection, but the experience might inspire him to try something he wouldn't otherwise be interested in.Be picky about juicesFruit juices count toward your toddler's daily fruit intake, but be particular about the kind and amount of juice you offer. Serve your toddler only 100 percent fruit juice or fruit-vegetable juice combinations. (These are full of nutrients and contain less natural sugar than many fruit juices.) Some kids even enjoy vegetable juice straight up!If your toddler won't drink milk, you may want to try juices fortified with calcium and vitamin D. Don't offer fruit ""drinks"" because they may contain as little as 10 percent juice and have an array of artificial flavorings and sweeteners.Keep in mind that even the healthiest fruit juices can easily become too much of a good thing. Juice can contribute to childhood obesity and malnourishment because a child who drinks a great deal of juice gets extra calories but not all the nutrients he needs. It can also lead to tooth decay, especially if your toddler carries around a bottle or sippy cup throughout the day.So limit your toddler to  to  of a cup of fruit juice each day, and use fresh fruit to meet the rest of his requirement. When he's thirsty, offer him water. Shake and bakeSmoothies are an easy way to get fruit and other nutritious foods into your child's diet. All you need is a blender and a few simple ingredients. You can use your choice of fresh fruit, frozen fruit (such as berries or bananas), or even canned pineapple or peaches. (Strain the syrup firstor better yet, buy the kind packed in 100 percent fruit juice.)You might want to include tofu or hard-cooked egg whitesthey add protein without changing the taste or textureand a bit of ground flax seed for extra fiber and omega 3s. Blend with fruit juice or add milk, yogurt, or frozen yogurt for a creamier drink and a dose of calcium.Whole wheat and bran muffins are good sources of grains and fiber, and they can also be a vehicle for fruits and vegetables. Make or buy them with bananas, blueberries, carrots, pineapple, or zucchini.Fortify but don't foolYou might try incorporating healthy foods into dishes you know your toddler likes, but don't be sneaky about it. (Even if he falls for it now, he may later feel betrayed when he figures out what's up.)Tell him you're giving him some special pasta spirals tonightwith spinach mixed in or with broccoli and cheese on top. Better to be up-front and encourage an adventurous approach to eating from the get-go.Make it countBe aware of your child's nutritional needs, but don't worryit's not hard to meet a toddler's daily requirements. A toddler only needs about 1,000 calories a day. That means a serving of vegetables is 1 to 2 tablespoons and a serving of meat is about the size of the palm of his hand. Here are some easy ways to serve up good nutrition:A tablespoon of peanut butter spread thinly (large dollops can cause choking) on a slice of whole wheat bread and half a cup of whole milk supply your toddler with lots of protein, magnesium, zinc, fiber, and calcium.And just one banana, half an apple, and half a cup of strawberries meet most toddlers' suggested intake of fruit for the day.Be a good role modelAs you consider all the ways of getting your toddler to eat well, remember to practice what you preach. If your child sees you eating lots of junk food or skipping meals, you can't expect him to eat properly. Make an effort to eat whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and you and your child will both be better off.Be upbeatForget the food fights. Let your toddler decide how much to eat. And don't use a sweet treat as a bribe or withhold it as a punishment.Try to make mealtime togetherat the table, not in front of the television as enjoyable as possible, so that your child can establish a good, healthy relationship with food.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Lactose intolerance,https://www.babycenter.com/0_lactose-intolerance_1201464.bc,"What is lactose intolerance?When you're lactose intolerant, it means your body can't produce enough lactase, the enzyme needed to digest lactose, the primary sugar in cow's milk and other dairy products. As a result, the undigested lactose stays in the intestine and causes gastrointestinal problems. These problems tend to be uncomfortable but not dangerous.Babies who are born prematurely sometimes can't produce adequate amounts of lactase for a while. A baby's level normally increases during the end of the last trimester of pregnancy.True lactose intolerance usually shows up in the grade-school or teen years. While it's possible for symptoms to appear earlier, it's very unlikely that your baby is lactose intolerant.What causes lactose intolerance?We don't know why some people are lactose intolerant and others aren't, but it's not rare. Between 30 and 50 million people in the United States are lactose intolerant.Genetics play a role: About 90 percent of Asian Americans  and as many as 75 percent of African American, Hispanic American, Jewish, and Native American adults  are lactose intolerant. About 15 percent of people of northern European descent have the condition.Very rarely, a baby is born with lactose intolerance. (Both parents would have to pass the gene for this type of lactose intolerance to the baby.) From birth, the baby would have severe diarrhea and be unable to tolerate the lactose in his mother's breast milk or in formula made from cow's milk. He'd need a special, lactose-free infant formula.If your baby has had a severe case of diarrhea, his body may temporarily have trouble producing lactase, and he may have symptoms of lactose intolerance for a week or two.Some medications can also cause the body to produce lower levels of lactase, causing temporary lactose intolerance. People with long-term conditions that affect the intestines (like celiac disease or Crohn's disease) sometimes suffer from lactose intolerance as well.What are the symptoms of lactose intolerance?If your baby is lactose intolerant, he may have diarrhea, abdominal cramping, bloating, or gas about 30 minutes to two hours after drinking breast milk or eating dairy products, like cheese or yogurt, once he starts eating solids. (Babies should not drink cow's milk until their first birthday.)Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.Some lactose-intolerant people can consume a small amount of dairy without symptoms. Others will be uncomfortable every time they have food containing even a small amount of lactose.Is lactose intolerance the same as a milk allergy?No. An allergy is an immune response, while lactose intolerance is a digestive condition. The symptoms can be similar, however. Abdominal pain or diarrhea after consuming milk products could be caused by a milk allergy or by lactose intolerance, for example.If your baby develops a dry, itchy rash or itching and swelling of the face, lips, or mouth whenever he has dairy products  or symptoms such as hives, watery eyes, or a runny nose  he may be allergic to one of the proteins in cow's milk.How will I know for sure if my baby is lactose intolerant?Again, it's very unlikely that your baby is showing signs of lactose intolerance at this age, but talk with his doctor. She'll ask about your baby's symptoms to help determine whether it's a possibility. She may suggest that you eliminate all sources of lactose from your baby's diet for a couple of weeks to see whether his symptoms subside.Can lactose intolerance be treated or prevented?No, but there are things you can do to help your baby if he's lactose intolerant.Read labels. You'll want to avoid dairy products and all other foods that contain lactose. Some seemingly innocuous foods contain milk products: pancake and cookie mixes, breakfast cereals, instant potatoes and soups, margarine, salad dressings, breads, and lunch meats. Check food labels for ingredients such as whey, curds, milk byproducts, dry milk solids, and nonfat dry milk powder.Thanks to recent legislation, products containing milk ingredients (or other common allergens) must be clearly labeled as such. This should make your task much easier.Watch how your baby reacts. Some people who are lactose intolerant can digest small amounts of lactose, while others are very sensitive to the tiniest quantities. You'll probably learn through trial and error how much of which dairy foods your baby can handle.Some cheeses have less lactose than others, for example, so they may be easier to digest. And live-culture yogurt is generally easier to digest than milk and other dairy products because the healthy bacteria in it helps produce lactase.If your baby is very sensitive, you'll want to avoid all sources of lactose. If not, you may be able to give him small amounts of selected dairy foods. He may find it easier to tolerate dairy products if he eats them along with other foods.Make sure all of your baby's nutritional needs are being met. If you find that you need to eliminate dairy products from your baby's diet as he grows, you'll want to be sure that he has other sources of calcium, which helps bones and teeth grow strong. Nondairy sources of calcium include leafy greens, fortified juices and soy milk, tofu, broccoli, canned salmon, oranges, and fortified breads.Other nutrients to be concerned about are vitamins A and D, riboflavin, and phosphorus. See our article on food sources of various nutrients for suggestions on how your child can get the nutrients he needs from nondairy sources. You might also find it helpful to consult a dietitian.Lactose-free dairy products are now available in many grocery stores. They have all the nutrients of regular dairy products without the lactose.And finally, if you find that it's difficult to get your baby all the nutrition he needs without dairy products, talk with his doctor about whether your baby might benefit from taking supplements.Show sources Hide sources AAP.

Gas pain in toddlers,https://www.babycenter.com/0_gas-pain-in-toddlers_1201487.bc,"Is it normal for children to have intestinal gas?Intestinal gas is a perfectly normal occurrence in children and in adults. (We grown-ups pass, on average, 2 liters of gas a day, and it can be as high as 8 liters a day.) In most cases, it isn't a cause for concern, unless your child is experiencing more than minor discomfort and complaining a lot.How can my child get relief from gas pain?Typically, a child with gas has bloating, pain, or burning in his belly, and frequent burping or flatulence. He may also feel a bit of nausea. It most likely only happens once in a while  for example, after he's overindulged at a birthday party.But it's also possible that particular foods or eating habits are to blame. The best thing you can do in that case is to try to eliminate or manage the offending food or habit that's triggering your child's gas.When your child does have uncomfortable gas pain, you can give him an over-the-counter ant-gas medicine (such as a simethicone product). These are safe for children of all ages.Heartburn and indigestion often accompany gas and cause abdominal pain. If your child is dealing with these, and your child is at least 6 months old, you can try an antacid (which neutralizes stomach acid). Look for an antacid that doesn't contain aluminum, as antacids with aluminum aren't recommended for children.Ask your pharmacist to help you find an anti-gas medication or antacid that's appropriate for your child.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.What could be causing my child's gas?Several factors could cause your child to have more gas or indigestion than usual:Roaming around during mealsMany time-crunched parents find themselves doing anything they can think of to get their kids to eat right  including letting them meander around house, watch television, or even roughhouse during meals.""When kids roam and play while they eat, they can get excited and trap air in their intestinal tracts during mealtime,"" says Michael Hart, director of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition at Carilion Clinic Children's Hospital in Roanoke, Virginia, and a professor of pediatrics at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine.If your child is a roamer, she probably eats fast or gulps so that chewing won't impede her playing. That also increases air consumption and isn't good for digestion. And if she has meals while watching television, she might ignore her body's signals that she's full and overeat.Encourage your child to sit at the table with you during meals, chew her food well, and take her time when eating. Reassure her that she'll have time to play after the meal.Eating a lot of high-fiber foods, like cereal, or fatty foods, like French friesSome children's guts are sensitive to fiber or fat. Take note of which types of foods bring on your child's bouts of gastrointestinal distress and try limiting them. You might also discuss his diet with his doctor, who may have other suggestions.Ingesting a particular protein in formula or breast milkIf your baby is breastfeeding and having gas pains, she may have an intolerance to a protein in Mom's diet  meaning she has trouble digesting it, resulting in gas and bloating. Elimination of the offending food (such as dairy products) may help.If your baby is formula-fed and seems to be having gas pains, it's possible that she has an intolerance to the cow's milk protein in the formula. If that's the case, her doctor can recommend a hypoallergenic option.Eating certain vegetablesLike adults, children can develop additional gas when they eat foods like beans, broccoli, and cauliflower. If your child eats these healthy foods, that's a good thing. Just make sure you don't overload him with too many gas-inducing veggies at consecutive meals.Drinking a lot of juiceIn general, parents misunderstand the benefits of giving kids juice. If your child is drinking more than a glass a day, it might be causing him to have a little extra gas.Some children have a hard time digesting the fructose and sucrose in juice. As a result, it can bring on gas, even diarrhea. Drinking too much juice can also make a child feel too full to eat nutritious foods at mealtime. Plus, it bathes the teeth in sugar.Ideally, a child under the age of 3 won't drink any juice or soda, says Hart. At most, he should drink no more than one 4-ounce glass of juice a day. Once he's 3 years and older, limit him to one 6- to 8-ounce glass a day.To avoid cavities and obesity, Hart explains, it's preferable to for children to drink only water and milk.For more help choosing healthy beverages for your child, see our slideshow on the best and worst drinks for thirsty kids.Drinking a lot of sodaCarbonated drinks like soda contain phosphoric acid, which can cause excessive gas and indigestion. Soda also tends to make children feel full, so they don't drink the necessary milk and water they should or get all the nutrients they need throughout the day. Try to eliminate soda from your child's diet or at least limit it to special occasions.Not drinking enough waterDrinking water won't eliminate your child's gas problem, but it will help improve any constipation or difficulty she might have passing stools. (Constipation often coincides with gas and abdominal discomfort.)Make sure your child has several glasses of water each day in addition to the milk or juice you give her.Could it be something more serious?If you find yourself treating your child several times a day for more than three consecutive days, or his gas is severe or coincides with other symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, or fever, call your doctor.Your child might have a more serious condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, appendicitis, a food allergy, or lactose intolerance. An illness such as gastroenteritis, strep throat, or a urinary tract infection can also cause abdominal pain, as can constipation.Source: Michael Hart, M.D., director of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition at Carilion Clinic Children's Hospital and professor of pediatrics at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine in Roanoke, Virginia"
Eating a vegetarian diet during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_eating-a-vegetarian-diet-during-pregnancy_1313874.bc,"Is it safe to eat a vegetarian diet in pregnancy?Yes. As long as you eat a variety of healthy vegetarian foods and plan your diet to include key nutrients, you can get all the nourishment you and your baby need, whether you're vegetarian or vegan. (Vegans do not eat any animal products including meat, fish, fowl, eggs, dairy, and honey.)If you're vegan, see our article on whether it's safe to eat a vegan diet during pregnancy.In some cases, you'll need to rely on fortified foods or supplements to make sure you're getting enough of what you need. Let your healthcare provider know about your diet at your preconception visit or your first prenatal visit. And always consult your doctor, midwife, or a dietitian before taking any supplements while you're pregnant.Along with a variety of fruit and vegetables (fresh, frozen, or canned) and whole grain products, you'll want to make sure you eat foods or take supplements that provide the following nutrients important for a healthy pregnancy.ProteinEat several servings of protein-rich foods each day. Good sources of vegetarian protein include eggs, dairy products, legumes, soy foods, nuts, seeds, and nut butters.Here are some ideas on how to work these foods into your diet:Add beans (such as kidney, black, or white), chickpeas, lentils, or tofu cubes to a saladHave a bean burritoSnack on a handful of almonds, walnuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, or roasted chickpeasSpread peanut or almond butter on whole grain bread or sliced applesSnack on yogurt or cottage cheeseSlice up a hard-boiled eggIronYour prenatal vitamin will likely provide some iron. But you'll also need to eat several servings of a variety of iron-rich foods every day. Good sources include:Iron-fortified breakfast cerealWhole grain or enriched foods, such as bread and pastaBeans and other legumesTofu, tempeh, and other soy-based foodsLeafy greens, such as spinach, kale, and chardAvoid having tea or coffee with your meals because these drinks contain tannins and polyphenols, which make it harder for your body to absorb iron from vegetables. Instead, have something that's rich in vitamin C, such as orange juice, tomato sauce, or broccoli, to help your body absorb the iron.You'll have a blood test early in your pregnancy to check your iron level. If yours is low, your healthcare provider may recommend that you take an iron supplement.ZincTry to get several servings of zinc-rich foods every day. Many foods that provide iron  such as fortified breakfast cereals, beans, soy foods, and whole grains  also provide zinc. Other good sources of zinc for vegetarians include nuts, seeds, wheat germ, and cheese.CalciumHave several servings of a variety of calcium-rich foods every day. Good sources include:Milk, cheese, and yogurtCalcium-fortified almond or soy milk, fruit juice, and breakfast cerealsWhite beans, blackstrap molasses, tahini, and calcium-set tofu. (To see if the tofu is calcium-set, check the list of ingredients for a calcium salt, such as calcium chloride or calcium sulfate.)Almonds or sesame seedsCertain green vegetables, including kale, collards, turnip greens, napa cabbage, broccoli, and bok choy. (Others, such as spinach, beet greens, and chard, contain calcium, but your body doesn't absorb the calcium from these vegetables as well.)Vitamin DThis vitamin helps your body absorb calcium. Cow's milk and some types of orange juice, cereal, and plant milk are fortified with vitamin D. Many prenatal supplements include vitamin D. If yours doesn't, you may want to consider taking a supplement.B12Vitamin B12 plays an important role in your baby's brain development. Eating several servings of dairy foods every day should provide you with enough, but if you are a vegetarian who limits or avoids dairy, you'll need to eat foods fortified with vitamin B12. These may include soy and other plant milks, breakfast cereals, and nutritional yeast. (Check for fortification on the product label.)If you don't eat dairy or fortified foods every day, and your prenatal supplement doesn't contain B12, you'll need to take a separate vitamin B12 supplement.IodineIodine is also important for your baby's brain development. Iodized salt, dried seaweed, cow's milk, and yogurt are good vegetarian sources of iodine. If you don't get a lot of these, check to make sure your prenatal vitamin contains iodine.DHADHA is an omega-3 fatty acid that promotes the development of your unborn baby's eyes and brain. It's found in fish, fish oil, and algae. Because it can be very difficult to obtain DHA from non-fish sources, you may want to take an omega-3 supplement derived from algae and suitable for vegetarians.NOTE: This article was reviewed by Reed Mangels, PhD, RD, LDN, adjunct associate professor in the nutrition department of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.Show sources Hide sources Foster M et al. 2015.

Stocking a healthy pantry,https://www.babycenter.com/0_stocking-a-healthy-pantry_1436250.bc,"If you stock a wide variety of pantry basics, you'll always be able to put together a healthy meal quickly. In addition to pantry items, pick up plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and good sources of protein (like lean meats and tofu). Keep these staples in good supply for quick, nutritious snacks and meals.Barley: Add to soups and stews for extra fiber.Beans: Stock either canned or dried to use in soups, casseroles, stews, and salads.Bread and tortillas: Choose whole grain varieties.Broths: Choose low-sodium varieties for soups, sauces, stews, and gravies.Canned vegetables: Keep on hand for quick meals. Look for brands low in sodium.Canned light tuna or salmon: Choose water-packed varieties for salads and casseroles.Cereal: Choose whole grain, high-fiber, unsweetened varieties, and top with fruit before serving.Crackers and pretzels: Choose whole grain varieties for snacks. (Check fat and sodium content.)Dried fruits: Good choices include apricots, raisins, dates, cranberries, and prunes. Eat for a snack or chop up and add to bread recipes, cereal, or stuffing.Canned or prepackaged fruit: Choose low-sugar varieties of applesauce, pears, and mandarin oranges.Evaporated milk: Choose low-fat varieties for use in baking, macaroni and cheese, and smoothies.Grains: Have wheat berries, couscous, polenta, millet, bulgur, or quinoa as an alternative to rice.Honey: Substitute for sugar in baked goods. (Do not serve uncooked honey to children younger than 1.)Nuts: Good choices include unsalted almonds, pecans, walnuts, pine nuts, and peanuts  whole, chopped, sliced, or ground. Eat for snacks or add to recipes.Oils: Canola oil works best for baking and stir-frying (it has a mild flavor and can withstand high heat). Olive oil is good for dressings.Pasta: Eat as a main or side dish. Can also be added to casseroles or soups to make these dishes heartier. Stock a variety of shapes and include some whole grain varieties.Pasta sauce: For a nutritional boost, choose varieties with vegetables  or add your own.Nut butter: Peanut, almond, cashew, or sunflower butter is great for sandwiches, curries, smoothies, and cookie recipes. Stock both smooth and chunky varieties.Rice: Stock a variety, including basmati, brown, wild, and risotto as well as instant rice for fast meals.Rolled oats: Old-fashioned or steel cut oats are high in fiber and come in slow-cooking or microwavable varieties.Salsa: Serve with low-fat tortilla chips or vegetables for dipping.Seeds: Good choices include unsalted pumpkin, sunflower, and sesame seeds for snacks and to add to breads, salads, and recipes.Soups: Look for low-sodium and fat-free choices for lunches or to mix into casseroles.Spices and herbs: Boost flavor with herbs and spices instead of butter and salt. Even kids may enjoy the taste of tarragon, oregano, curry, rosemary, and garlic.Sun-dried tomatoes: These are a healthy way to flavor salads, casseroles, sauces, and grilled vegetables.Tomatoes, tomato paste, and tomato sauce: Your body absorbs more lycopene (an antioxidant) from canned tomatoes than from fresh ones.Vegetable oil cooking spray: Use these for a nonfat way to prevent foods from sticking.Vinegars: Cider, red or white wine, and balsamic for dressings, sauces, and flavoring.Wheat germ: Sprinkle on cereal to add a nutty taste and fiber.Whole wheat flour: Add fiber by substituting for a portion of white flour in recipes. If your child doesn't like the taste of wheat bread, you can get the same nutritional benefits by using white whole wheat flour.Long-storing vegetables: Winter squash (such as spaghetti, butternut, and acorn squash), potatoes, and sweet potatoes keep well, as do onions and garlic.Snacks: Look for brown rice cakes, low-fat tortilla chips, and plain jarred or low-fat microwave popcorn.Learn more:The basics of eating well during pregnancyHealthy eating for kidsFederal dietary guidelines: ChooseMyPlate.govShow sources Hide sources ACS. 2014.

Plus-size and pregnant: Eating well,https://www.babycenter.com/0_plus-size-and-pregnant-eating-well_1504864.bc,"When you're pregnant, it's important to focus on eating well: You need to make sure your baby's getting enough nutrients to grow  and you're getting enough nutritional support to grow a baby!This isn't the time to diet or cut back on calories. Instead, take a close look at how and what you eat and figure out what's best for you and your baby. Keep in mind how much weight to gain during pregnancy as you make healthy food choices.Top tips for eating wellEat a good breakfast. It's true that the first meal of the day is the most important one: A breakfast with protein, fat, carbohydrates, and fiber will make you feel better the rest of the day.Eat small meals with snacks in between, rather than three big meals.Include protein at every meal and snack, and avoid foods with refined sugar or processed white flour. This helps stabilize your blood sugar levels and keeps hunger at bay.Work fruits and veggies into your meals in creative ways: Toss assorted chopped vegetables into your breakfast eggs, or sprinkle shredded zucchini or carrots into low-fat quick breads. Apple and cucumber slices make great additions to sandwiches. Add apple chunks, dried cranberries or currants, or chopped dried apricots to salads.Focus on folate: Pregnant women are advised to get 600 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily to help prevent neural tube defects. Many prenatal vitamins contain at least that much. (This is in addition to the folate from food, which your body doesn't absorb as well as the synthetic kind.)Some studies have found that plus-size women have lower blood folate levels than smaller women. Check with your doctor to see if you might need more than 600 mcg of folic acid during your pregnancy.Choose unsaturated good fats (olive, canola, peanut oils) over saturated fats (animal fats, whole-fat dairy, palm oil) and trans fats (shortening, margarine).Use a pregnancy food diary to keep track of your food and nutrient intake to make sure you're getting enough good stuff. It's also useful for tracking your mood and hunger levels so you can spot patterns you may need to change.Follow the seven principles to eating well during pregnancy.Discover 10 ""fast"" foods a pregnant woman could love  and five to avoid.Snack and drink ideasHere are some healthy ways to satisfy hunger pangs in between meals:An apple and a handful of almonds or walnutsA slice of whole grain toast spread with 1 tablespoon of almond butterA 6-ounce glass of skim milk and a banana1/2 cup of plain yogurt, sweetened with a touch of honeySix whole grain crackers with an ounce or two of low-fat cheeseA hard-boiled egg and some snackable veggies, such as celery, carrots, and peppersWatch what you drink  anything with refined sugar (juice drinks, lattes, and sodas) can make your blood sugar levels fluctuate and contribute to hunger and headaches. Even sugar-free soda can lead to weight gain, according to the American Diabetes Association, though experts don't know exactly why. Try these choices instead:Low-sodium vegetable juice (Drink only pasteurized juices  unpasteurized juices aren't safe for pregnant women. Make your own juice at home or stick to canned or bottled juices that have been pasteurized.)Sparkling water with a splash of pomegranate juice and a few sprigs of mintCarrot juice with a splash of orange juiceVanilla- or chocolate-flavored sugar-free soy milk over iceSkim milk over ice with a splash of sugar-free flavoring, like vanilla or hazelnut.(Note: Artificial sweeteners are fine in moderation, though it's probably a good idea to avoid saccharin, which crosses the barrier in your placenta that protects your baby.)If you have eating problemsCheck in with your healthcare provider, who can suggest modifications to your food routine and provide referrals to specialists who can support you and help you stay on track. A nutritionist can help you figure out how to feel satisfied while eating a diet that's healthier for both you and your baby.

Extended breastfeeding: Is it for you?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_extended-breastfeeding-is-it-for-you_8496.bc,"Nursing past your baby's first birthday is known as extended breastfeeding. In many countries, it's considered normal, healthy, and common.However, some people in the United States frown on the practice for cultural reasons. So if you choose extended breastfeeding for your baby, be prepared for rude comments or curious stares.However, there are significant benefits to extended breastfeeding, so don't let others pressure you to stop. Instead, consider the pros and cons, then do what feels right for you.What are the pros of extended breastfeeding?Even though your child now gets most of his nutrition from solid food, breast milk still provides calories, growth hormones, valuable immunities, vitamins, and enzymes. Studies show that breastfeeding toddlers are sick less often than their peers.When a child gets sick, breast milk may be the only thing he'll consume. This helps him stay hydrated and boosts his immune system.Breastfeeding is good for your health too. When compared to women who never breastfed, nursing women have lower rates of diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and high blood pressure.As your child becomes more self-reliant, breastfeeding can be an important source of reassurance and emotional support. The strong connection your child feels with you while nursing will foster independence, not make him overly dependent or clingy, as some may have you believe.Sometimes people think weaning a child sooner helps him develop a strong sense of self-worth and independence, says Kathleen Huggins, author of The Nursing Mother's Companion. But forcing a child to stop nursing before he's developmentally ready won't necessarily create a more confident child  it could even make him more clingy.If you travel and stay overnight in unfamiliar places, the comfort of your breast may be the best way to ease your child's fears and make him feel more secure.You may be able to delay getting your period for a year or more  an advantage for anyone who dreads the thought of dealing with cramps and bloating again. (But remember that nursing isn't an effective form of birth control, especially after you introduce solids and are probably breastfeeding less often.)Continued breastfeeding may help to keep your weight in check. Some research shows that breastfeeding combined with a healthy diet and exercise may keep you trimmer for years to come.Weaning your child when he's ready feels more natural and less abrupt than picking an arbitrary end point.What are the cons of extended breastfeeding?People who think nursing an older child is strange may make rude comments or criticize. You may prefer to be more cautious about breastfeeding in public if you want to avoid the remarks. This can be difficult if your toddler habitually lifts up your shirt in public and asks for a quick snack.Some people say it's harder to wean a child after the first year. Many mothers are nervous about trying to wean a stubborn 2-year-old or allowing a toddler to wean on her own timetable. You can wean your child any time, of course, but if you take the lead, you might have to work to distract your child with other food, drink, and activities when she wants to nurse.Your child may start to rely on the breast when she's bored or feels like it's the only way to get your attention.Nursing a toddler when you have another baby on the way is possible and safe, but some women find the very idea overwhelming.How can I make extended breastfeeding work for me?If you're bothered by unsolicited comments and stares, nurse your child at home before heading out to the store or the park. Some moms prefer nursing at set times during the day  like in the morning, before naps, or before bed  and have their toddlers drink from a cup during meals and snacks.If you don't care what people think or say, then have some snappy responses ready when someone asks you the inevitable question: ""Is he still nursing?"" Sometimes a simple ""yes"" is the best conversation stopper. Or, the next time you're nursing in public and someone asks, ""Are you ever going to stop breastfeeding?"" you could say, ""Yes, in about 10 minutes.""If your child seems to be nursing out of boredom or to get your attention, engage him in other ways. Toddlers are eager to explore the world and need stimulation to fuel their rapid development.Teach your child a code word to use when he wants to nurse, so that when he wants to feed in the middle of a restaurant, no one will pay any attention.Take care of yourself. Eat a diet that includes lots of fresh fruits and vegetables, protein, whole grains, and calcium-rich foods. To stay hydrated, drink a glass of water every time you breastfeed. And if you're not sure you're getting all the nutrition you need, talk to your healthcare provider or a dietitian.When breastfeeding beyond the first year, be sure your toddler is also eating nutritious, well-balanced meals so that he continues to grow at a healthy rate. And if your toddler goes through a picky phase with food, don't worry  he'll get lots of valuable nutrients from your breast milk.If you're pregnant and want to keep nursing, be prepared for your milk supply to ebb as your hormone levels change. You might produce less milk as your body starts redirecting resources toward the developing fetus, and the taste of your milk may change. But many women succeed in nursing an infant and a toddler when pregnant  it just takes extra time and energy, so you'll need to be doubly sure you're eating the right foods and drinking enough fluids.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012.

MyPlate food guide for young children,https://www.babycenter.com/0_myplate-food-guide-for-young-children_9296.bc,"The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) developed the website ChooseMyPlate.gov to help you plan a healthy diet. MyPlate uses a place setting to illustrate the five food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy products. The website has recipes and sample menus, tips for vegetarians, and suggestions for healthy eating at restaurants. Below are some of the key recommendations.FruitsBuy fruits that are fresh, dried, frozen, and canned (in water or 100 percent juice).Limit fruit juice to no more than 3/4 cup per day. (Juice doesn't contain fiber like fruit does.)Buy fresh fruit in season when it's less expensive and more flavorful.VegetablesEat a variety of colorful vegetables to get the most nutrients.Frozen vegetables are just as nutritious as fresh, so stock up and always have plenty of choices on hand.When using canned vegetables, choose ones labeled ""reduced sodium,"" ""low sodium,"" or ""no salt added.""GrainsChoose whole grains at least half the time.Check the label for the fiber content of whole grain foods and choose the ones that contain at least 10 percent of the daily value.Don't rely on the color of a food to determine whether it's a whole grain  look for ingredients like whole wheat, brown rice, buckwheat, or oatmeal, to be listed first on the label.ProteinsHave seafood as your main protein at least twice a week.Eat beans, peas, or soy products often.Choose the leanest cuts of meat and trim away visible fat.DairySwitch to fat-free or low-fat (1 percent) milk.Cheese can be high in saturated fat, so choose products labeled ""reduced fat"" or ""low-fat.""Regular cream cheese, cream, and butter are not considered part of the dairy food group. They're high in saturated fat and have little or no calcium.Adapted from materials provided by the USDA's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion.Go to BabyCenter's nutrition guidelines article for young children for more information about your child's eating habits."
Cystic fibrosis in children,https://www.babycenter.com/0_cystic-fibrosis-in-children_11422.bc,"What is cystic fibrosis?Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disease. A child with CF has a faulty gene that affects the movement of sodium chloride (salt) in and out of certain cells.The result is thick, heavy, sticky mucus; salty sweat; and thickened digestive juices. The thick mucus secretions can clog the lungs, making a child with CF very prone to breathing difficulties, lung infections (the mucus provides a rich environment for bacteria), and, eventually, severe lung damage. And when thickened digestive fluids from the child's pancreas can't get to the small intestine to break down and absorb nutrients from the food he eats, he may also have digestive and growth problems.What are the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis in children?Poor growth is one of the first signs of CF. Parents may also notice a nagging cough and wheezing. Coughing and wheezing are hardly unique to children with CF, of course. These symptoms could be caused by viral bronchiolitis (an inflammation of the small breathing tubes), asthma, or even a dusty, smoky environment. Each of these conditions is far more common than any genetic disease.Still, cystic fibrosis is the most common life-shortening genetic disease among people of Northern European descent. Other symptoms include salty skin, a big appetite with no weight gain, and large, greasy stools.Sometimes the condition doesn't become apparent until a child has had a series of repeated lung infections or severe growth problems. If your child has any of these symptoms, talk with her doctor.Cystic fibrosis can't be cured, but there are new treatments that can not only prolong a child's life but may also help make that life more normal. And the earlier cystic fibrosis is diagnosed, the more effective those therapies will be.How common is cystic fibrosis?The chances of your child having CF are about 1 in 3,000 if your child is Caucasian, 1 in 9,000 if he's Hispanic, 1 in 11,000 if he's Native American, 1 in 15,000 if he's of African heritage, and 1 in 30,000 if he's Asian American.Children get cystic fibrosis when they inherit one defective CF gene from their mother and another from their father. (More than 10 million Americans carry the CF gene  most without knowing it.) Children with the disease are usually diagnosed before the age of 2, but about 10 percent of cases go undetected until adulthood.How can I find out whether my child has CF?The definitive test for CF is something called a sweat test. This test is quick and painless: A drug called pilocarpine stimulates a spot on the arm to sweat. The doctor places a piece of filter paper on the area to absorb the sweat and then tests its sodium and chloride content. Higher than normal levels strongly suggest cystic fibrosis. A family history of CF and other tests, such as a chest X-ray and blood or saliva genetic tests, may add to the evidence.How is the disease treated?Children with cystic fibrosis need ongoing medical care. This is best provided at a specialized CF center with a team of doctors, nurses, and others who have expertise with the disease. Symptoms vary greatly from child to child, even when they are siblings with the same genetic defect. Often symptoms come and go  they may be relatively mild or frighteningly severe.The vast majority of young children with CF can be treated as outpatients, but they need to be seen frequently to make sure the disease is being treated properly. At each visit a sputum (saliva or mucus) sample is taken to help determine which germs are causing lung infections. Occasionally, if symptoms flare up, the child has to be admitted to the hospital to get intravenous antibiotics.If your child has cystic fibrosis, he should receive routine childhood vaccines against such common illnesses as Hib and pertussis and an annual flu shot.Most children with CF are given prescription medications, including antibiotics to treat infection, medicines that help break up mucus in the lungs, and drugs that reduce the inflammation that causes lung destruction. Each child responds best to a different combination of physical and drug therapies, and it's the job of the doctors and the parents to find the right mix. Parents play an important role by watching how their children respond to different drugs.Researchers are working to develop other treatment options as well, including gene therapy (to replace the gene that causes the disease), drugs that help move salt in and out of the cells properly, and new drugs to prevent and treat infections.To loosen mucus in your child's lungs, his doctor will probably show you how to thump your child's chest with a cupped hand. You may need to do this a couple of times each day for about 30 minutes each time. There are also electric devices  like a chest clapper and a vibrating vest  that can perform this task.Because the disease usually gums up the pancreas, your child will need help with his digestion as well. Without easy access to pancreatic enzymes, the small intestine has trouble breaking down food, especially fat, leaving children with CF undernourished and hungry. Much of what they eat passes through their body without being absorbed.The doctor may decide that your child needs to take a pancreatic enzyme supplement with every meal to help his body absorb the food he eats. (You'll need to open the capsule and mix the tiny beads with a little food.) You'll want to encourage your child to eat as frequently as possible and give him any nutritional supplements the doctor recommends.Proper nutrition is vital because a child who is otherwise strong, healthy, and well nourished gives all the CF therapies a better chance to provide some relief. Your child's doctor will determine exactly which supplements  and how much of them  your child needs to take.The good news is that, in many cases, children with CF can lead nearly normal lives, going to school with everyone else, playing on the playground, and being a kid, even if the adults around him are being more vigilant. The prospects for children with cystic fibrosis keep getting better: Several decades ago most children with CF died by their teens. Today, the life expectancy of a child born with cystic fibrosis is about 37 years. Where can I find more information about cystic fibrosis?The universe of people with cystic fibrosis and their loved ones is large, well informed, and supportive. Here are some of the best websites to explore:Visit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a central clearinghouse for information, advocacy, and support.For a weekly summary of research information, go to Cystic Fibrosis Research.See an excellent source for new drugs now under investigation for CF therapy.Share your concerns about your child's condition and trade tips with other parents at the Children With Cystic Fibrosis BabyCenter Community Group.Show sources Hide sources Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

Top 5 things doctors wish you'd do for your toddler,https://www.babycenter.com/0_top-5-things-doctors-wish-youd-do-for-your-toddler_10319216.bc,"1. Don't turn the car seat around on your child's first birthdayMany parents eagerly do, since some kids like the car better once they're facing forward and it's easier to see the child that way. But it's safer to hold off. ""The longer the baby sits rear-facing, the better,"" says pediatrician Jennifer Shu. ""Studies show it's safer for kids all the way up to 4 years old to sit rear-facing, but we just don't have very many rear-facing car seats that size available.""Safe Kids USA recommends keeping toddlers facing backward until at least their first birthday, until they weigh 20 pounds, or until they outgrow the height and weight limits of their convertible car seat.2. Know this life-saving numberMake sure everyone who cares for your toddler knows this number: 1-800-222-1222.That's the nationwide number for Poison Control, and once you have a mobile, curious toddler, it's important to display it someplace prominent. ""Everyone caring for your child should have easy access to this number, including grandparents and babysitters,"" says pediatrician Alanna Levine. Program it into your cell phone, too, in case your toddler swallows something while you're out of the house.3. Go easy on the juiceMany kids are getting way too much of it. ""It's leading to weight problems and cavities, among other nutrition and health issues,"" says pediatrician Sindhu Philip.Your toddler doesn't necessarily need juice at all, but if you do offer it, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends no more than 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup a day for kids age 1 to 6 so it doesn't replace other foods. Philip says juice can be a real problem for toddlers. ""A lot of toddlers start to fill up on liquids  they drink mostly milk or juice  and they have no appetite for meals,"" she says. ""One year of age is when we commonly see anemia, and it's usually because they're drinking rather than eating."" To prevent tooth decay, don't let your toddler wander around with a sippy cup of juice for too long, and don't serve it at bedtime.4. Stay strong during food battles""I wish parents would have the confidence to be the ones in charge during food standoffs,"" says Nancy Krebs, a pediatrician and nutrition specialist. ""Just continue offering healthy foods rather than just catering to your child's preferences."" Food jags are normal, but that doesn't mean you should cave in and start serving, say, only white foods. If kids are hungry, they'll eventually eat at least some of what you serve.And remember, at this age, one day they'll love zucchini and one day they won't. Just because they reject it once doesn't mean they won't eat it the next time.Although parents hate the thought of their kids going hungry, Krebs says learning to recognize hunger cues is an important skill. And kids need less food than many of us think, anyway. ""Remember, a toddler's portion size is only one-fourth of an adult's,"" says Philip. ""We tend to want to force-feed our kids.""5. Model behavior you want to seeToddlers watch every little thing you do, so if you're not already modeling healthy habits, now's the time to start. Your requests to buckle the seat belt, try new foods , turn off the TV , and drink milk won't get you very far if your child doesn't see you doing the same thing.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012.

Iron in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-in-your-childs-diet_10324691.bc,"Iron is crucial for children's health and development. Read on to find out how much iron your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for childrenWhy iron is importantIron is important for making hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying red pigment in blood, and myoglobin, a pigment that stores oxygen in muscles. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in the United States, and a lack of iron can causeanemia, resulting in fatigue and weakness.Iron also affects brain development, so anemia can also cause long-lasting problems with cognitive development. A severe iron deficiency can be life-threatening.How much iron does your child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 7 milligrams (mg) per dayAges 4 to 8 years: 10 mg dailyIf your child eats a vegetarian diet, aim for twice as much iron because iron from nonanimal sources is harder for the body to absorb.Your child doesn't have to get enough iron every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Child Height PredictorFind out how tall your child is likely to be at age 18.Animal sources and plant sources of iron: What's the difference?Heme iron  the kind you get from animal sources such as meat, seafood, and poultry  is easily absorbed by the body. The body needs help to absorb nonheme iron, which is the kind found in nonanimal sources like dark green leafy vegetables, legumes, fortified bread and grains, and dried fruit. (Egg yolks contain mostly nonheme iron.)You can increase the amount of nonheme iron the body absorbs by serving it with foods that contain heme iron or with foods rich in vitamin C, such as orange juice, oranges, strawberries, red and green bell peppers, papaya, broccoli, grapefruit, cantaloupe, tomatoes, broccoli, mangoes, and sweet potatoes.This is especially important for children eating vegetarian diets: They need to focus on eating plenty of iron-rich foods with foods high in vitamin C to boost absorption.Good sources of ironIron can be found in a variety of foods. Here are some good sources:1/2 cup fortified, ready-to-eat cereal: 12 mg1/2 cup fortified oatmeal, prepared with water: 5 mg1/4 cup raw tofu: 2.22 mg (The iron content of tofu varies by type, so check the label.)1/4 cup soybeans: 2 mg1/4 cup boiled lentils: 2 mg1/4 cup baked beans with pork and tomato sauce: 2 mg1/4 cup navy beans: 1 mg1/4 cup kidney beans: 1 mg1 ounce braised lean beef, chuck: 1 mg1 teaspoon blackstrap molasses: 1 mg1/2 medium broiled hamburger (1.5 oz.), 95 percent lean: 1 mg1/4 cup garbanzo beans: 1 mg1/4 cup cooked frozen spinach: 0.9 mg1/4 cup black beans: 0.9 mg1/4 cup pinto beans: 0.9 mgOne slice whole wheat bread: 0.9 mg1/4 cup raisins: 0.7 mgThe amount of iron in a food varies somewhat, depending on brand of the product or the cut of the meat. Note that raisins and other chunky foods (like beans) are choking hazards for very young children. Mash or cut these foods into small pieces.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts of food shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can your child get too much iron?Yes. Although it's essentially impossible to get too much iron from food, supplements are another matter. Excessive iron from supplements can be toxic to children, causing serious health problems or even death. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) for iron is 40 mg per day for children age 13 and younger. That's the maximum amount considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine.If you're concerned that your child isn't getting enough iron, talk to his doctor before giving your child a supplement.And always keep iron supplements locked up and out of sight  it's easy for curious little hands to get into medicine and supplements when you're not looking. And never encourage kids to take chewable vitamins as a ""treat,"" or they may take them when you're not looking.Show sources Hide sources IOM. 2001.

Legumes in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_legumes-in-your-pregnancy-diet_10325923.bc,"Why legumes are so importantLegumes are nutritional powerhouses. Which foods are legumes? From a botanical perspective, legumes are plants with a seedpod that splits in half. This includes beans, peas, soybeans, peanuts, and lentils. They're an excellent source offolate,potassium,iron, andmagnesium, and essential fatty acids.Legumes also contain compounds called phytochemicals. Researchers are studying phytochemicals for their ability to prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.Legumes also provide soluble fiber, which has been linked with lower levels of total cholesterol and LDL (""bad"") cholesterol and possibly a reduced risk of colon cancer. Fiber can also help preventconstipation andhemorrhoids common problems during pregnancy.Most legumes are a good source ofprotein, so they fall into the same category as meat when it comes to meal planning. But they contain no cholesterol and are generally low in fat  and they're inexpensive too!Good legume choicesHere are some good options for legumes, along with the grams of protein in each serving. Aim for about six servings (or 3 cups) of legumes in your diet each week.1/4 cup soybeans, dry roasted: 10 g1/2 cup cooked soybeans: 8 g1/2 cup raw regular tofu, prepared with calcium sulfate: 10 g1/4 cup peanuts, dry roasted without salt: 9 g1/2 cup cooked edamame: 9 g1/4 cup (2 ounces) tempeh: 8 g1/2 cup cooked split peas: 8 g1/2 cup cooked lentils: 9 g1/2 cup cooked black beans: 8 g1/2 cup cooked kidney beans: 8 g1 cup plain soy milk: 7 g1/2 cup cooked garbanzo beans (chickpeas): 8 g1/2 cup cooked lima beans: 7 g1/2 cup cooked peas: 4 gAlthough sugar snap peas and snow peas are legumes, they're not high in protein. That's why they're counted as vegetables for food planning purposes.Easy ways to add legumes to your daily dietExperiment with new and different kinds of legumes: Try adzuki beans, anasazi beans, black-eyed peas, edamame, or fava beans, for example.If time is short, choose quick-cooking legumes, like lentils, or buy canned or frozen legumes. (The nutritional content is about the same.)Add legumes to soups, stews, casseroles, and stir fries.Pure beans to make spreads and dips.Add your favorite types of beans to salads.Snack on small amounts of soy nuts, almonds, or peanuts.Try a recipe for tofu loaf instead of meatloaf.Add tempeh to tomato sauce, stir fries, and casseroles.Show sources Hide sources AHA. 2015.

Picky eaters: The One-Color Kid,https://www.babycenter.com/0_picky-eaters-the-one-color-kid_10331625.bc,"When faced with a picky eater, how do you ensure your child gets the nutrients he needs - without a fight. Our food experts offer strategies and recipes for your one-color kid.See all eight picky eaters here.The One-Color KidThe dilemma: Typically, only beige or white food passes muster. Your child's eating world centers around bread, cheese, pasta, milk, rice, potatoes  and not much else.The nutritional concern: Chances are, if your child is on a one-color kick, he's probably not including pale veggies such as cauliflower in his repertoire so he's missing the same nutrients as the Veggie Hater. Plus, those colorless foods he favors often consist of refined grains or simple starches, which lack the fiber that regulates digestion, prevents constipation, stabilizes blood sugar, and staves off hunger.Vicki Lansky, mother of two, grandmother of three, and author of Feed Me I'm Yours: If your child is on a color-specific food jag, find ways to enhance what he'll eat. Make beige carbohydrates more nutritious by adding wheat germ, soy powder, or eggs for protein. If it's white  like mashed potatoes  try adding in a little mashed cottage cheese.Jessica Seinfeld, mother of three and author of Deceptively Delicious: To get veggies in the mix, add some cauliflower puree to potatoes or a little butternut squash puree to macaroni and cheese. Start slowly. Some kids are more likely to notice hidden additions than others. Try a tablespoon or two of puree at first and then taste and check the color and texture as you go. Add more gradually  you know what your kid will eat  to make sure the flavor of, say, the squash doesn't overpower the cheese.Ann Cooper, nutrition expert who revamps school cafeterias around the country and coauthor of Lunch Lessons: Find a healthier way to do it. In our schools, we serve whole grain bread and buns that have some white flour. Or we mix white and brown rice together. Most kids don't even notice.Ellyn Satter, mother of three, grandmother of six, and author of Secrets of Feeding a Healthy Family: Put the beige foods alongside colorful foods that your child may be skeptical of. Match familiar and unfamiliar favorites with foods that are less so, then leave it up to the child. You can accommodate your child's preferences without catering to his demands. That means no making separate meals or acting like a short-order cook.Jennifer Iserloh, private chef and author of Secrets of a Skinny Chef: Offer just a little of something with color. Parents often make the mistake of filling a plate with something children are wary of  it can be too much for some kids. Or serve it on a small dish so it doesn't overwhelm your child.Pumpkin MuffinsBy Vicki LanskyThese autumn-inspired treats  full of nutritious pumpkin, chewy raisins, and fragrant spices  are sure to please your pickiest eater. Serve them for breakfast along with eggs or cottage cheese and fruit.For an easy dessert, top muffins with vanilla ice cream or yogurt and maybe a drizzle of caramel sauce if you're feeling decadent. You may want to cut these muffins in half before serving to your kids.Ingredients:1 1/2 cups flour1/2 cup sugar2 teaspoons baking powder1 teaspoon cinnamon1/2 teaspoon ginger1/4 teaspoon cloves1/2 cup raisins1 egg, slightly beaten1/2 cup milk1/2 cup canned pumpkin (solid pack)1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted2 1/2 teaspoons sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon cinnamonInstructions:Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a 12-cup muffin pan or line with paper liners. In a large bowl, sift together the first six ingredients. Stir in raisins.In a separate bowl, combine the egg, milk, pumpkin, and melted butter or margarine.Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and mix until just blended.Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full. Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.Makes 12 muffins. Cottage Cheese PancakesBy Vicki LanskyOn a lazy weekend morning, nothing is better than a stack of pancakes piled high. Unfortunately, most pancakes aren't very nutritious, and by the time you load them with maple syrup and butter, they're very high in fat and sugar. Your kids will love these high-protein, low-fat cottage cheese pancakes. Top them with fresh berries or low-sugar jam to make them extra special.Ingredients:3 eggs1 cup cottage cheese2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted2 tablespoons flour or cornmeal*Instructions:Beat eggs with a small mixer (or whisk). Add cottage cheese and mix until fairly smooth. Add butter or margarine. Stir in flour or cornmeal until just blended.Drop small amounts of batter onto a hot griddle or frying pan. Cook pancakes on one side until bubbles start to form around the edges. Turn pancakes over and cook on the other side until firm to the touch.Serve immediately.Serving amount varies with the size of pancakes.*Note from the Editor: For a heartier and less eggy pancake, add 1/3 cup of flour or cornmeal to the wet mixture.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Our food experts offer strategies for your separatist.See all eight picky eaters here.The SeparatistThe dilemma: If the mashed potatoes gently graze the salmon, or the rice dares to mingle with the beans, there's a good chance neither item will find its way onto your kid's fork. In your child's compartmentalized view of eating, foods are not allowed to mix or even touch.The nutritional concern: You run the risk of compromising variety  and leaving wholesome foods out of the mix  to spare yourself the wrath (or the waste) of the separate food purist.Picky eaters (Mom Confidential) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:18Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:18Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

BabyCenter, the number 1 pregnancy and parenting web and mobile destination worldwide, conducted the study, which found that 55 percent of moms surveyed say they cant think of a reason not to track their health or their children's health  however, the majority of moms find the current options on their smartphones too time consuming and therefore too difficult to use.BabyCenters findings indicate that moms have a growing appetite for health and fitness tracking that is not yet served by the mobile apps that are currently available to them. When asked, Which of the following do you currently track and which would you track on your smartphone if there was an easy way to transfer the information to your phone, the survey found a significant gap in every category:CategoryCurrently TrackWould Track If It Was EasierMoms Activity/Fitness:31%45%Moms Weight:30%45%Moms Nutrition:23%45%Moms Sleep Pattern:8%32%Childs Development:30%40%Childs Nutrition:10%27%Childs Activity:12%26%BabyCenter also found that moms are willing to invest in new devices that give insight into their health and that of their children. Of the moms surveyed, 19 percent already had a fitness tracker, up 36 percent from 2013, and a whopping 80 percent indicated interest in a device. Moms also expressed interest in a number of new health/safety products and wearable technology.The percent somewhat or very interested:Wearable baby monitor that tracks your babys movements and warns you if something is wrong: 70 percentActivity tracker for their child: 67 percentFitness tracker integrated into clothing: 64 percentGoogle Glass: 46 percentBeyond fitness and health tracking, moms also demonstrated their reliance on their smartphones when shopping for over-the-counter medications. The results show the importance of the mobile web even for physical retail purchases. Among moms who used their phone when shopping for over-the-counter medicines (14 percent), two out of three (63 percent) responded that they had researched an over-the-counter medicine on their phone, and 52 percent said they had read product reviews and recommendations. Nearly a third (29 percent) purchased over-the-counter medicinal products online, and 37 percent used their device to find a local drugstore or similar retail outlet. Price comparison app use appears to be less popular when shopping for over-the-counter medicines, with 25 percent reporting they had used them to buy these products, with online mobile coupons higher at 30 percent.There is more pressure on moms than ever before to make the right choices for their health and that of their children, so their interest and use of their smartphones for this purpose is not surprising, said Julie Michaelson, Vice President of Sales, BabyCenter. Mom is mobile first, and she expects that the health products and services that she uses show a similar approach, whether an over-the-counter medication or fitness support.Moms want more information about their health and that of their kids, but are finding their current options for mobile devices too frustrating to use, Michaelson continued. This is a tremendous window of opportunity for mobile app and device companies to create options that integrate more easily into Moms daily life, and to better communicate their availability to moms via mobile.To review further findings from the BabyCenter U.S. Mobile Mom 2014 Report: Health & Fitness Go Mobile for Moms, please visit: http://www.babycentersolutions.com/docs/BabyCenter_2014_US_Health_and_Fitness_Go_Mobile_For _Moms.pdfMethodology:Fielded in July 2014, the U.S. Mobile Mom 2014 Report polled 1,118 U.S. women ages 18 to 49, with a mean age of 32.

Weaning: When and how to stop breastfeeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_weaning-when-and-how-to-stop-breastfeeding_3272.bc,"What does it mean to have weaned a child?Your baby is considered weaned when he stops nursing and gets all his nutrition from sources other than the breast. Although babies are also weaned from the bottle, the term usually refers to when a baby stops breastfeeding.Weaning doesn't necessarily signal the end of the intimate bond you and your child created through nursing. It just means you're nourishing and nurturing him in different ways.For example, if you often nursed your child for comfort, you'll have to find other ways to make him feel better. Read a book, sing a song together, or play outside instead. If your child protests, try to stay calm and be firm. If you need to, hand him to your partner for a cuddle.When should I start weaning?You're the best judge of when it's time to wean, and you don't have to set a deadline until you and your child are ready. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that mothers breastfeed for at least a year  and encourages women to breastfeed even longer if both you and your baby want to.Despite what friends, relatives, or even strangers may say, there's no right or wrong way to wean. You can choose a time that feels right to you, or let your child wean naturally when she's older.Baby-led weaning: Weaning is easiest when your child begins to lose interest in nursing, and that can happen any time after she starts eating solids (around 4 to 6 months). Some babies are more interested in solid food than breast milk by 12 months, after they've tried a variety of foods and can drink from a cup.Toddlers may become less interested in nursing when they grow more active and aren't inclined to sit still long enough to nurse. If your child is fussy and impatient while nursing or is easily distracted, she may be giving you signs that she's ready.Mother-led weaning: You may decide to start weaning because you're returning to work. Or maybe it just feels like the right time. If you're ready but your child isn't showing signs she wants to stop nursing, you can wean her off the breast gradually.When it's the mother's idea, weaning can take a lot of time and patience. It also depends on your child's age and how she adjusts to change.It's a good idea to avoid the 'cold turkey' approach to weaning. For example, a weekend away from your baby or toddler is not a good way to end the breastfeeding relationship. Experts say that abruptly withholding your breast can be traumatic for your baby and could cause plugged ducts or a breast infection for you.How do I wean?Go slowly, and expect to see signs of frustration from your baby at first. Ease the transition by using these methods:Skip a feeding. See what happens if you offer a bottle or cup of milk instead of nursing. You can substitute pumped breast milk, formula, or whole cow's milk (if your child is at least a year old).Reducing feedings one at a time over a period of weeks gives your child time to adjust. Your milk supply also diminishes gradually this way, without leaving your breasts engorged or causing mastitis.Shorten nursing time. Start by limiting how long your child is on the breast. If he usually nurses for ten minutes, try five.Depending on his age, follow the feeding with a healthy snack, such as unsweetened applesauce or a cup of milk or formula. (Some babies younger than 6 months may not be ready for solids.) Solid food is complementary to breast milk until your baby is a year old.Bedtime feedings may be harder to shorten because they're usually the last to go.Postpone and distract. Try postponing feedings if you're only nursing a couple of times a day.This method works well if you have an older child you can reason with. If your child asks to nurse, reassure him that you will soon and distract him with a different activity. If he wants to nurse in the early evening, explain that he has to wait until bedtime.To ease your baby's transition to a bottle, try putting a few drops of breast milk on his lips or tongue before slipping the bottle's nipple into his mouth. You can also try giving him a small amount of breast milk in a bottle a couple of hours after breastfeeding but before he's so hungry that he's impatient and frustrated.Will my child get enough nutrients?Even exclusively breastfed infants need extra nutrients that breast milk can't provide, like vitamin D. If you wean your baby before she reaches her first birthday, she'll need to continue to drink breast milk or iron-fortified formula until she's a year old. Then once your child reaches toddlerhood, it'll be necessary to give her a wider variety of foods that offer the range of nutrients she needs to help her grow.What to do when weaning becomes a struggleIf you've tried everything to wean your child and nothing is working, maybe the time isn't right.Have you recently gone back to work? Your child may still be adjusting to the new routine.Is your child sick? Babies often want to nurse more frequently when they don't feel well. And breastfeeding a sick child is not only comforting, but also a good source of nutrition.Is your household going through a major life change? Events such as a move or divorce can also make weaning more difficult. Even going through a new developmental stage can make it hard to wean.Try again in another month. Sooner or later, it'll happen.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015. Weaning your baby.

Picky eaters: The Carbo Loader,https://www.babycenter.com/0_picky-eaters-the-carbo-loader_10331648.bc,"When faced with a picky eater, how do you ensure your child gets the nutrients she needs - without a fight. Our food experts offer strategies and recipes for your carbo loader.See all eight picky eaters here.The Carbo LoaderThe dilemma: You offer your kids a balanced diet, but they only go for the bread, pasta, crackers, and chips.The nutritional concern: Without a doubt, kids need carbohydrates for energy. But not all carbs are created equal. Complex carbs, such as cereal, whole grain bread, and some fruits and vegetables, provide fiber and take a while to break down in the body so you don't feel hungry right away. But refined or simple carbs, including foods like white bread, cakes, and cookies, have added sugars and fewer nutrients. They can make blood sugar spike and drop sharply.Missy Chase Lapine, mother of two and author of The Sneaky Chef: Simple Strategies for Hiding Healthy Foods in Kids' Favorite Meals: The carbo loader describes a lot of picky eaters and most of those carbohydrates are white and refined. You can do better. For example, you can now buy whole wheat ""white"" bread made from white wheat (instead of the red wheat that's used to make brown whole wheat bread).Ann Cooper, nutrition expert who revamps school cafeterias around the country and coauthor of Lunch Lessons: Changing the Way We Feed Our Children: Our kids are not allowed to load up on just carbs. We see our role as educators, so we explain why they need to have a balanced meal. And we mix our carbs  semolina and whole grain pasta together  to enhance the nutritional content. Don't forget other whole grains, such as bulgur and whole-wheat couscous, to mix it up a little.Jessica Seinfeld, mother of three and author of Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food: Courses, courses, courses. If your child is hungry, she'll eat what you serve first. That's why I often start with a plate of raw veggies and dip and save the carbs for last.Vicki Lansky, mother of two, grandmother of three, and author of Feed Me I'm Yours: Find ways to make the carbohydrates more nutritious. Add a thin smear of peanut butter to that bread. Serve fried rice with egg and little pieces of vegetables. Hide vegetables in baked goods  like zucchini in muffins  or carrots, squash, and tomatoes in pasta sauce. Thank goodness for blenders.Ellyn Satter, mother of three, grandmother of six, and author of Secrets of Feeding a Healthy Family: One of those preferred foods should be served at each meal, along with others, without comment.Jennifer Iserloh, private chef and author of Secrets of a Skinny Chef: Think about portion control. I see kids eating giant white bagels. Instead, find child-size mini bagels and pitas. (If a certain food can't fit in the palm of a kid's hand, it's probably too much.) Go for whole grains over refined, and get a little low-fat cream cheese on top to boost its nutritional value. Likewise, mix some Parmesan cheese and pureed vegetables into that pasta, and make it whole grain.Vegetable Lo MeinBy Ann CooperPasta is always a hit with kids, and lo mein is no different. If you want to make this dish a main course, add protein in the form of tofu, chicken, or pork. This dish is an excellent choice for the lunch box because it can be eaten warm or at room temperature, and extra marinating makes the noodles more flavorful.Ingredients:3/4 pound lo mein noodles1 to 2 tablespoons sesame oil, as needed2 tablespoons plus 3/4 teaspoon cup hoisin sauce2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce2 tablespoons canola oil1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic1/3 cup sliced scallions1 cup julienned carrots1 cup thinly sliced celery1 cup thinly sliced red onion3/4 cup bean sprouts3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantroInstructions:Cook lo mein noodles in salted water according to package directions. Let cool and toss lightly with enough sesame oil to prevent the noodles from sticking together.In a separate bowl, combine the hoisin and soy sauces and mix well.In a wok or a large frying pan, heat some canola oil and quickly saute the ginger, garlic, and scallions until they release aroma. Then add the carrots, celery, and red onions and briefly saute before adding the bean sprouts.In a smaller frying pan, heat some more canola oil and saute the noodles. When they are hot and look lightly browned, combine them with the other sauteed ingredients.Add the soy sauce mixture to evenly coat the stir-fry.Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve.Makes 8 servings. Chicken and RiceBy Ellyn SatterThere is no easier way to cook for a family than to make an oven meal. A well-constructed oven meal does most of the last-minute work for you. You just take it out of the oven and put it on the table. You can also use the hot oven to prepare other foods, like garlic bread or a baked dessert. This chicken and rice oven meal was one of my standbys when my children were growing up. They have all, in turn, made it in their own kitchens.Ingredients:1 1/2 cups uncooked enriched white rice10-ounce can cream of mushroom soup1 packet onion soup mix1 3/4 cups water2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, or 2 teaspoons dried1 chicken, cut in pieces, or 6 boneless chicken breast halves or boneless thighs, or some combination, about 1 1/2 pounds totalSprinkle of paprika1/4 teaspoon black pepperInstructions:Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish, mix the rice, mushroom soup, dry soup mix, and water. Sprinkle fresh or dried parsley evenly over the top. Place the chicken on top of the rice and soup mixture. Sprinkle with paprika and pepper for added flavor and color.Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake until the chicken is tender, approximately 1 hour. Remove the foil during the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking so that the chicken will brown. (If you bake uncovered for too long, the rice will dry out.)Makes approximately 6 servings.Sneaky Chef Unbelievable Chocolate Chip CookiesBy Missy Chase LapineOats and white beans make a decent chocolate chip cookie? And I want to throw in wheat germ and whole-wheat flour? Well, tasting is believing. Watch your kids devour these seemingly sinful yet incredibly nutritious cookies. I also managed to cut back on the sugar by a third, resulting in a mere 1/2 teaspoon of sugar per cookie. Then I added fiber from nutrient-packed wheat germ, whole wheat flour, oats, almonds, and white beans, all of which help to slow down the release of sugar and avoid the usual 'crash and burn' that often happens after kids eat cookies.Ingredients:1 cup Flour Blend (equal parts white flour, whole wheat flour, and wheat germ)1/2 teaspoon baking soda1/2 teaspoon salt1/4 cup rolled oats, finely ground in a food processor2 tablespoons blanched, slivered almonds, finely ground in a food processor (omit if allergic)8 tablespoons unsalted butter1/4 cup sugar1/4 cup brown sugar1 large egg1 teaspoon vanilla extract1/4 cup White Bean Puree (recipe below)1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips1 cup chopped walnuts or dried fruit such as blueberries or raisins (optional)Instructions:Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove butter from refrigerator to soften.In a large bowl, whisk together Flour Blend, baking soda, salt, ground oats, and ground almonds, if using. Set aside.In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter and both sugars until creamy. Beat in egg, vanilla, and White Bean Puree.Add dry ingredients and mix on low speed, then stir in chocolate chips (and walnuts or dried fruit, if using).Drop rounded 1/2 teaspoons of dough, spaced 2 inches apart, onto nonstick or parchment-lined baking sheets.Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool on a metal rack.Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature.Makes about 50 cookies.White Bean PureeBy Missy Chase LapineIngredients:15-ounce can white beans (great northern, navy, butter, or cannellini), or 1 cup dry beans (If you're starting with dry beans, soak for an hour, then cook according to instructions.)1 to 2 tablespoons waterInstructions:Rinse and drain the beans and put in the bowl of your food processor. Pulsing, puree the beans with 1 tablespoon of water until smooth, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. The goal is a smooth, but not wet, puree. (Aim for the consistency of peanut butter.) If necessary, thin with a little more water by adding 1 teaspoon at a time until there are no flecks of whole beans visible.Makes 1 cup.The puree can be stored in the refrigerator for up to three days, or you can freeze 1/4-cup portions in sealed plastic bags or small plastic containers.Note: Double the recipe if you'd like to make extra puree to store for later use. Cocoa BatsBy Jennifer IserlohYou will need a bat-shaped cookie cutter to makes these crisp and crunchy chocolate bats  perfect for a healthy Halloween! The kids will love them because they're chocolate sugar-cookie dough, but I like them because they have whole wheat flour and are lower in fat than a traditional sugar cookie.Ingredients:3/4 cup margarine, chilled1 cup granulated sugar2 egg whites1 teaspoon vanilla extract1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1 container of cookie sprinklesInstructions:Place the margarine and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Beat until combined. Mix in the egg whites and vanilla.Add the flour and mix until a soft dough begins to form.Press the dough between two 18-inch sheets of wax paper. Keeping the dough inside the two sheets of wax paper, roll out to a 1-inch thickness. Fold the sheet of dough in half (still in the wax paper) and refrigerate 1 hour until the dough starts to become firm.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the dough from the fridge, unfold, and peel off the top piece of wax paper. Roll out dough to a1/4-inch thickness. Use the cookie cutter to press out the bat shapes. Transfer them to the cookie sheets and use sprinkles to make the eyes.Bake 9 to 10 minutes until the bats are firm to the touch. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely before storing in an airtight container for up to three days. These bats stay crispy even when stored!Show sources Hide sources CDC. 2011.

10 ways to avoid gaining too much pregnancy weight,https://www.babycenter.com/0_10-ways-to-avoid-gaining-too-much-pregnancy-weight_10396224.bc,"It can be challenging to stick to the guidelines forpregnancy weight gain, especially if you've never craved carbohydrates so much in your life and it seems like everywhere you turn, people encourage you toeat for two.But gaining too much weight while pregnant can raise your risk for birth complications likec-section deliveryand premature birth. And even if you start pregnancy overweight or obese  like more than half of American women  sticking to the recommended range of weight gain can significantly reduce your risk of health problems likegestational diabetes andpreeclampsia.Below, doctors and nutritionists offer 10 important  and achievable  tips for healthy pregnancy weight gain.1. Start pregnancy at a healthy weight if possible""The most important thing you can do before getting pregnant, in addition to takingprenatal vitamins, is to start your pregnancy at a healthy weight,"" says Lauren Hyman, an ob-gyn in West Hills, California.If you're at the ""thinking about it"" stage of pregnancy, or trying to conceive, consider making apreconception appointment. Your healthcare provider can help you figure out your currentbody mass index(BMI) and suggest ways to lose weight if necessary.How to stay fit and healthy during pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:11Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:11Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videos2. Eat moderately and oftenYou don't need that many extra calories per day to nourish your growing baby. Currentguidelinescall for 340 extra calories per day in your second trimester and 450 extra calories per day in your third trimester if you're starting pregnancy at a healthy weight. (If you're underweight or overweight, these numbers will differ based on your weight gain goal.)That's not a lot of extra to play around with, so choose foods that pack a big nutritional punch and help you feel satisfied.""Focus on small, frequent meals that are high in lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables,"" says Hyman. Learn more aboutmeal planning during pregnancy.Then choose healthy snacks between meals.""Eating a healthy snack every three hours should help you avoid overdoing it at mealtimes,"" advises dietitian Frances Largeman-Roth, author ofFeed the Belly: The Pregnant Mom's Healthy Eating Guide. Not only will you be providing good nutrition for your baby, but your blood sugar will stay level throughout the day so you're less likely to feel starving at dinnertime.Choose meals and snacks that include protein, fiber, and some healthy fat, says Largeman-Roth. Examples include an apple with two tablespoons of peanut butter, an English muffin with a scrambled egg and spinach, protein-enriched pasta and tomato sauce, or Greek yogurt with a palmful of nuts or granola sprinkled on top.Fruit with lots of fiber and high water content  like grapefruit, oranges, apples, berries, pears, and plums  can also help you feel full and keep constipation at bay.3. Drink up (water, that is)It's important to avoid dehydration during pregnancy  and drinking enough water has the added benefit of helping you feel satisfied between meals and snacks.The Institute of Medicine advises pregnant women to drink 10 8-ounce glasses of water or other beverages each day. Some nutritionists suggest adding morefor each hour of light activity. Largeman-Roth recommends three liters of water daily, or 101 fluid ounces.Other experts suggest monitoring urine color: If it's dark yellow or cloudy, your body needs more fluids. Sip throughout the day to keep your urine color pale yellow or clear  a sign of proper hydration.Drinking water also easesconstipation, one of the less happy side effects of growing a person inside of you. When you're pregnant, your digestive system slows down, which ensures that you wring every possible bit of nutrition from your food. Getting enough fluids will help keep things moving along and prevent uncomfortable bloating.Largeman-Roth, who recently gave birth to her third child, ups her water intake by keeping a pretty glass or water bottle with her at all times and chilling pitchers of water with sliced lemon, lime, or cucumber to make it more appealing. ""You drink more when your water tastes good,"" she says.4. Make your cravings constructiveNo one expects you to avoid french fries and ice cream completely when you're pregnant. After all, cravings come with the territory.The key is to satisfy your urges while getting theproteinandhealthy fats that you and your baby need (and that will help you feel full).""A little trick I use is to combine something healthy with one of my less-healthy cravings,"" says Largeman-Roth. ""For example, I mix a high-fiber cereal with some really yummy granola on top. You get the fiber you need to help prevent constipation, plus the sweet crunch you're craving.""When Largeman-Roth was pregnant and craved the salty satisfaction of chips and salsa, she toasted a tortilla, then topped it with a fried egg and a pile of shredded cheese, salsa, and diced avocado.""It has more calories than just the chips,"" says Largeman-Roth, ""but it packs in a lot more nutrients."" The added protein from the cheese and egg will help you feel full longer.5. Make starches work harderCarbohydrates can be a pregnant woman's best friend, especially if you're battling the nausea and vomiting ofmorning sickness. But simple starchy food such as white bread, rice, and pasta raise your blood sugar without giving you the nutrition that comes with whole grains.Better to reach for complex carbohydrates  such as brown rice, quinoa, andwhole grainbreads and pastas  which not only provide you and your baby with more nutrients, but will help you feel full for longer and make you less likely to give in to unhealthy cravings later in the day.6. Start a simple walking regime""The most valuable thing any pregnant woman can do is walk,"" says Jeanne Conry, past president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. For expecting moms who are new to exercise, Conry recommends a program she calls ""10 Minutes for Me."" She has her patients walk 10 minutes a day and keep track of when they do it. Every 30 days, she has them add another 10 minutes, so that by the end of the first trimester they're walking 30 minutes daily, which they can continue to do for the rest of pregnancy.Boston ob-gyn Laura Riley, who is medical director of labor and delivery at Massachusetts General Hospital, suggests that her patients purchase pedometers and shoot for 10,000 steps a day. It may sound daunting, but remember that steps done while running errands and walking around the office still count.""It's not just important for managing weight gain,"" says Riley. ""You'll have a lot fewer aches and pains as you get to the end of pregnancy if you stay active.""7. If you're already moving, don't stopUnless your workout routine includes competitive kickboxing or other risky activities for expecting moms, there's no reason you can't keep it up during pregnancy.With the exception of contact sports, Riley tells her patients to ""do whatever they normally do  running, walking, aerobics, whatever. There are very few things you cannot do during pregnancy.""You may have to modify your movements as your girth grows and your center of gravity changes, but otherwise, says Riley, there's no reason you can't stick to your usual activity.Learn thebest kinds of exercise during pregnancyand find outwhen it's not safe to work out.8. Have the occasional indulgenceLargeman-Roth satisfied her pregnancy sweet tooth with a half-cup serving of full-fat ice cream (about the size of a tennis ball) served in a small bowl to make it look bigger.Hyman, the California ob-gyn, agrees that her patients shouldn't deprive themselves of a favorite treat. Instead of making that indulgence a daily habit, though, she advises enjoying it once a week.9. Make weight a regular discussionHaving a conversation about weight gain with your doctor or midwife at every prenatal visit will help you stay on track and make changes if you need to.Conry calculates her patients' body mass index (BMI) at the first visit, then gives guidance onpregnancy weight gain.""I tell them what their goals are and what will happen during the different trimesters,"" Conry says.Calvin J. Hobel, a maternal-fetal medicine expert at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, studies the health of women during and after pregnancy. He recommends that doctors show women how they are gaining on a curve to help them stay on track.""Seeing where you are at the beginning and then watching your trajectory is very important,"" says Hobel.To see where you land on the weight-gain curve, and learn how much you should gain based on your height and pre-pregnancy weight, try BabyCenter's pregnancy weight gain estimator.10. Breastfeed if you canWhile this tip won't help during pregnancy, it's worth knowing that breastfeedingcan help you meet your goals for healthy weight loss afterward.""Breastfeeding is the best fix for losing the extra weight you've gained during pregnancy,"" says Hobel.When breastfeeding goes well, it burns 500 calories daily. Also, birth and the body changes that happen in the first six weeks postpartum should help you drop your first 20 pounds (just from the baby, placenta, and water weight leaving your body). It's a great jump start to losing your pregnancy weight.Kate Ropeis a freelance writer and editor and coauthor ofThe Complete Guide to Medications During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015a.

The thick mucus secretions can clog the lungs, making a child with CF very prone to breathing difficulties, lung infections (the mucus provides a rich environment for bacteria), and, eventually, severe lung damage. And when thickened digestive fluids from the child's pancreas can't get to the small intestine to break down and absorb nutrients from the food she eats, she may also have digestive and growth problems.What are the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis in babies?Fifteen to 20 percent of newborn babies with cystic fibrosis have something called meconium ileus at birth. This means their small intestine is obstructed with meconium, the seaweed-green substance that comes out in a baby's first poop. Sometimes the intestine will become twisted or not develop properly as a result. The meconium can also obstruct the large intestine, in which case the baby won't have a bowel movement for one or two days after birth.Other babies with CF are fine at birth but then develop problems breathing or can't seem to put on weight in their first four to six weeks. Poor growth is one of the first signs of CF. Parents may also notice a nagging cough and wheezing.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.Coughing and wheezing are hardly unique to children with CF, of course. These symptoms could be caused by viral bronchiolitis (an inflammation of the small breathing tubes), asthma, pneumonia, or even a dusty, smoky environment. Each of these conditions is far more common than any genetic disease.Still, cystic fibrosis is the most common life-shortening genetic disease among people of Northern European descent. Other symptoms include salty skin, a big appetite with no weight gain, and large, greasy stools.Sometimes the condition doesn't become apparent until a child has had a series of repeated lung infections or severe growth problems. If your baby has any of these symptoms, talk with his doctor.Cystic fibrosis can't be cured. But there are new treatments that can not only prolong a child's life but may also help make that life more normal. And the earlier CF is diagnosed, the more effective those therapies will be. How common is cystic fibrosis?The chances of your baby having CF are about 1 in 3,000 if your baby is Caucasian, 1 in 9,000 if she's Hispanic, 1 in 11,000 if she's Native American, 1 in 15,000 if she's of African heritage, and 1 in 30,000 if she's Asian American.Babies get cystic fibrosis when they inherit one defective CF gene from their mother and another from their father. (More than 10 million Americans carry the CF gene  most without knowing it.) Children with the disease are usually diagnosed before the age of 2, but about 10 percent of cases go undetected until adulthood.How can I find out whether my baby has CF?Newborn babies in the United States (and in many countries worldwide) are routinely tested for CF. A small spot of blood is taken from the baby's heel and tested for a protein that is higher in babies with CF. If the result is too high, a further test is done to look for the most common mutations that cause CF.Newborn screening isn't 100 percent accurate. Rarely, a baby who has CF will be missed by this test. But more commonly a baby who does not have CF will be referred for a more definitive test (a sweat test) to make sure he doesn't have the disease.If there's any reason to suspect that your baby might have CF  because of symptoms, a newborn screening test, or because you know it runs in the family  the doctor will perform a sweat test.The sweat test is quick and painless: A drug called pilocarpine stimulates a spot on the arm to sweat. The doctor places a piece of filter paper on the area to absorb the sweat and then tests its sodium and chloride content. Higher-than-normal levels strongly suggest cystic fibrosis. A family history of CF and other tests, such as a chest X-ray and blood or saliva genetic tests, may add to the evidence.Genetic testing can determine whether a couple planning a pregnancy needs to be concerned about cystic fibrosis. Both parents would have to be carriers of the CF gene for the baby to have a risk of being born with the disease. Most ob-gyns offer this testing to expectant parents. If the test comes back positive, the couple would be referred to a genetic counselor. However, there are several thousand DNA mutations that can cause CF, and most ob-gyns test for only the most common 30 or 40 of these. So it's possible to be told you aren't a CF carrier when in fact you are.How is the disease treated?Babies and children with cystic fibrosis need ongoing medical care. This is best provided at a specialized CF center with a team of doctors, nurses, and others who have expertise in the disease. Symptoms vary greatly from child to child, even when they are siblings with the same genetic defect. Often symptoms come and go  they may be relatively mild or frighteningly severe.The vast majority of young children with CF can be treated as outpatients, but they need to be seen frequently to make sure the disease is being treated properly. At each visit a sputum (saliva or mucus) sample is taken to help determine which germs are causing lung infections. Occasionally, if symptoms flare up, the child has to be admitted to the hospital to get intravenous antibiotics.If your baby has CF, she should receive routine childhood vaccines against such common illnesses as Hib and pertussis, as well as an annual flu shot (once she's six months old).Most kids with CF are also given prescription medications, including antibiotics to treat infection, medicines that help break up mucus in the lungs, and drugs that reduce the inflammation that causes lung destruction. Each child responds best to a different combination of physical and drug therapies, and it's the job of the doctors and the parents to find the right mix. Parents play an important role by watching how their child responds to different drugs.Researchers are working on other treatment options as well, including gene therapy (to replace the gene that causes the disease), drugs that help move salt in and out of the cells properly, and new drugs to prevent and treat infections.To loosen mucus in your baby's lungs, the doctor will probably show you how to thump your baby's chest with a cupped hand. You may need to do this a couple of times each day for about 30 minutes each time. There are also electric devices  like a chest clapper and a vibrating vest  that can perform this task.Because the disease usually gums up the pancreas, your baby will need help with her digestion as well. Without easy access to pancreatic enzymes, the small intestine has trouble breaking down food, especially fat, leaving children with CF undernourished and hungry. Much of what they eat passes through their body without being absorbed.The doctor may decide that your baby needs to take a pancreatic enzyme supplement with every meal to help her body absorb the food she eats. (You'll need to open the capsule and mix the tiny beads with a little baby food.) You'll also want to encourage your baby to eat as frequently as possible and give her any nutritional supplements the doctor recommends.Proper nutrition is vital because a child who is otherwise strong, healthy, and well nourished gives all the CF therapies a better chance to provide some relief. Your baby's doctor will determine exactly which supplements  and how much of them  your baby needs to take.The good news is that, in many cases, babies with CF can grow to lead nearly normal lives, going to school with everyone else, playing on the playground, and being a kid, even if the adults around her are being more vigilant. The prospects for children with cystic fibrosis keep getting better: Several decades ago most babies with CF died by their teens. Today, the life expectancy of a child born with cystic fibrosis is about 37 years.Where can I find more information about cystic fibrosis?The universe of people with cystic fibrosis and their loved ones is large, well informed, and supportive.

Asian bodywork for fertility,https://www.babycenter.com/0_asian-bodywork-for-fertility_10317212.bc,"From ConceiveOnline.comWhile the methods used in the Asian bodywork techniques of chi nei tsang (pronounced chee-nayt-song), shiatsu (shee-aht-su), and tui na (tway-na) may differ somewhat, they share a common theme of trying to bring the body into balance for maximum health and fertility. All focus on finding the balance between yin and yang, says Gonzalo Flores, L.Ac., M.Ac.OM, co-founder of GroundSpring Healing Center in Portland, Oregon.A simple way to understand yin and yang is to think about muscles. According to Flores, everything in your body thats overused, overextended, or pulled is yang; conversely, anything thats sore, fatigued, or weak is yin. If you apply that to fertility, Flores explains, a practitioner will ask questions such as whether a woman has pain and whether shes ovulating. The practitioner will try to determine whats causing chior energyto be blocked.Asian approaches to healing, such as Traditional Chinese Medicine, always emphasize the whole personbody, mind, and spiritand treatment focuses on how these three elements affect one another. The practitioners goal is to bring your body back into its natural state of balance so you can conceive, carry, and deliver a healthy baby.To that end, its not uncommon for acupuncture, herbs, supplements, and nutritional and lifestyle changes to be part of a months-long protocol youll be asked to follow in addition to regular visits for bodywork. Because few of these techniques have been scientifically studied in the West, be sure to talk to your doctor before trying them, especially if youre undergoing any kind of fertility treatments.Chi nei tsangWhat it isChi nei tsang is a Taoist approach brought to the U.S. by a Thai man named Mantak Chia, says Linda Becker, C.M.T., L.M.T., a certified Asian bodywork therapist in Phoenix, Arizona. The approach is based on the belief that organs in the abdominal area become congested. Stagnation from what we eat, from pollution, and emotions are a part of a weakening process, especially if were constantly engaging in negative emotions, explains Becker. According to Taoist tradition, each of the organs has both a positive and negative emotion related to it, which is part of the balance. The abdomen has to be open for the body to be healthy and optimally fertile.How it works to promote fertilityA chi nei tsang practitioner uses the belly button as a guide to making an assessment. The navel should be completely symmetrical, but if there are pulls, ridges, or lines of tension, then that tells me what organ in the system is having an issue and what emotion might be attached to that, explains Becker. During a treatment, the practitioner uses the pads of several fingers to apply gentle but firm pressure to various points in the abdominal area to release tension, tightness, and congestion, trying to get energy, or chi (pronounced chee) moving freely again.The chi nei tsang techniques help to work out emotional charges from the past that can interfere with a healthy pregnancy, says Gilles Marin, director of the Chi Nei Tsang Institute in Berkeley, California. These often manifest as low sperm count and prostate problems for a man, and endometriosis and other gynecological problems for a woman. Even when no physical symptom for infertility can be found, chi nei tsang treatments can allow deep-seated patterns of tension to leave the body, he asserts. Stress reduction and dietary modifications are also important components of the treatment.What it costsA treatment lasts 30 to 60 minutes and costs about $50 to $150 per hour.For more informationFor a list of certified practitioners, contact the Chi Nei Tsang Institute (www.chineitsang.com; 510-848-9558); the American Organization for Bodywork Therapies of Asia (www.aobta.org; 856-782-1616); or use the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicines database at www.nccaom.org (go to the Find a Practitioner tab and then look for the Asian Bodywork Therapy designation).ShiatsuWhat it isShiatsu uses hands-on manipulation to counteract poor nutritional choices, too little exercise and sleep, environmental sensitivities, genetics, and too much work, worry, and stressall the things that cause the bodys chi (or ki in Japanese) to get stuck and throw you out of balance.How it works to promote fertilityAs with chi nei tsang, many shiatsu therapists will spend some time evaluating your abdomen through palpation to make an assessment. During the massage, the practitioner will focus on 12 or 24 specific meridians, or lines of chi that run throughout the body. For fertility treatments, special attention will be paid to the chong mai (pronounced chawng my), or central channel, which connects all the meridians to the uterus.Shiatsu, like tui na, encompasses a wide range of stylesit can take the form of hard, forceful pressure with manipulation, or gentler, subtle pressure with the stretching of limbs. But every practitioner should be working on that central channel, whether along the spine or arms or legs, says Flores. Youll be clothed during a shiatsu treatment.What it costsA treatment lasts about an hour and costs roughly $50 to $150. Youll likely come in for a session once a week to twice monthly.For more informationContact the American Organization for Bodywork Therapies of Asia (www.aobta.org; 856-782-1616).Tui naWhat it isTui na bodywork (also called tuina) is part of Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), an age-old holistic approach to wellness and healing. It may be used in conjunction with other aspects of TCM, including Chinese herbs and acupuncture.How it works to promote fertilityDuring a tui na session you remain clothed, and your therapist applies gentle or forceful pressure (depending on his or her preferred stylesome dont even touch the body) to move the muscles, joints, and torso. Tui na is more of an osteopathic or orthopedic style of manipulation, to try to mobilize the joints, Flores notes.But like all holistic Asian bodywork, it also takes into account the emotional and mental sides of a persons life. As with chi nei tsang and shiatsu, the belly is also important in tui na in diagnosing and treating fertility issues. Says Flores, In Chinese medicine, the lower abdomen is the center of a persons body. It is home to ming men, or the 'gate of life.' Tui na practitioners may also use the pulse and the appearance of the tongue in making their assessment.What it costsTreatments last from 30 to 90 minutes and cost from $50 to $150.For more informationContact the American Organization for Bodywork Therapies of Asia (www.aobta.org; 856-782-1616).This article originally appeared in the Summer 2007 issue of Conceive Magazine."
Should your kids eat fish: How they can avoid mercury and still get their omega-3s,https://www.babycenter.com/0_should-your-kids-eat-fish-how-they-can-avoid-mercury-and-sti_10319857.bc,"Should my child eat fish?Many parents struggle with this question. The answer is yes, but you'll want to choose their fish carefully.Studies show that fish provide an array of nutrients that are important for your child's development. Most experts agree that the key nutrients are two omega-3 fatty acids  DHA and EPA  that are difficult to find in other foods. Fish is also low in saturated fat and high in protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients.On the other hand, you've probably heard that fish contain contaminants such as mercury, which can harm a child's developing brain and nervous system.Most experts agree that children should eat some fish. In fact, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that children 2 to 8 years old eat 3 to 6 ounces of fish per week, and that children 9 years old and older eat 8 to 10 ounces per week. But it can be hard to figure out which fish are best.Here are some guidelines to help you limit your child's exposure to mercury while making sure she gets the nutrients she needs.How does mercury get into fish?Mercury is everywhere, even in the air we breathe.Some of the sources (such as volcanoes and forest fires) are natural. It's also released into the air by power plants, cement plants, and certain chemical and industrial manufacturers.And mercury has been used for decades in making thermometers, thermostats, fluorescent lights, and many other products. When these items end up in a landfill, the mercury may be released.When mercury settles into water, bacteria convert it into a form called methylmercury. Fish absorb methylmercury from the water they swim in and the organisms they eat. Methylmercury binds tightly to the proteins in fish muscle and remains there even after the fish is cooked.What could happen if my child eats fish that's high in mercury?The body easily absorbs methylmercury from fish.Studies show that exposure to even low doses of methylmercury can affect the brain and nervous system. Babies (including those in utero) and young children are most vulnerable to high levels of methylmercury because their brains and nervous systems are still developing.Why not just take fish off my child's menu?Fish is too good a nutritional choice  especially during early childhood. Studies have shown that getting enough omega-3s during infancy (either through breastfeeding or supplemented formula) has a positive effect on a child's vision and cognitive development.Which fish are best to eat?Good choices include salmon, trout, anchovies, herring, sardines, and shad.Purdue University publishes a handy wallet card that tells you where most commercial fish falls on the mercury contamination scale and how much of each it's okay to eat.Purdue also has free iPhone/iPod apps that can help you track your seafood consumption and estimate your intake of omega-3s, mercury, and PCBs, a group of industrial pollutants that can harm your baby's nervous system.Which fish should I avoid altogether?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EPA advise women of childbearing age and young children not to eat four high-mercury species: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico.Other experts and advocacy groups would like to expand this list. Purdue University toxicologist Charles Santerre recommends that you also avoid eating all fresh or frozen tuna, striped bass, bluefish, Chilean sea bass, golden snapper, marlin, orange roughy, amberjack, Crevalle jack, Spanish mackerel from the Gulf of Mexico, and walleye from the Great Lakes.He also recommends not eating striped bass and bluefish, which can be high in mercury and PCBs.What about canned tuna?There's some disagreement when it comes to canned tuna.The FDA recommends that children eat no more than two servings a week of canned ""chunk light"" tuna and no more than one serving a week of canned ""solid white"" or albacore tuna. That's because albacore tuna comes from large fish that tend to contain more mercury.Other experts, like Edward Groth, an independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, recommend that you avoid serving canned tuna entirely. Groth points out that canned tuna is by far the largest source of methylmercury in the American diet.What about fish caught in local waters?Check advisories from your state or local health and environmental agencies to figure out which fish to avoid and how much of each type it's safe to eat.These advisories are usually indicated on signposts in fishing areas. You can also access your state's advisories on this map, which is kept up-to-date by Purdue University.If you don't find an advisory for local fish, the EPA recommends limiting your child to one serving per week and not serving her any other fish that week.What can my child eat, other than fish, to get omega-3s?It's not easy to find DHA and EPA in other foods.Many foods  such as eggs, milk, soy beverages, juice, yogurt, bread, and cereal  are now fortified with omega-3s, but most of these contain only ALA. ALA is an omega-3 that provides some health benefits, but not the same ones you get from DHA and EPA. (Most food labels don't specify the type of omega-3.)You may have heard that flaxseed is a good source of omega 3s, but it does not provide DHA or EPA. The only omega-3 fatty acid in plant foods is ALA.What about omega-3 supplements?""In general, it's better to get specific nutrients from food than supplements,"" says Keli Hawthorne, a registered dietitian in the pediatrics department at the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at Austin. That way your child will benefit from other nutrients in the foods at the same time. Also, we don't have conclusive evidence that these supplements provide the same significant benefits as eating fish.Still, if you find that your child isn't eating enough foods that contain omega-3s, you might want to talk with her healthcare provider about giving her a supplement.Omega-3 supplements provide EPA and DHA and are mercury-free. Many contain fish oil, but mercury is not stored in fatty tissue, so it's not in the oil, although PCBs may be.These supplements come in liquid, soft chews, and soft gel form, and some are flavored to mask the fishy taste. If you give your child a flavored variety, be sure to store the container out of reach (so she doesn't eat them like candy).How much omega-3s should my child get each day?The Food and Nutrition Board (the group that sets the recommended daily intake levels for nutrients) has not set recommended levels for DHA or EPA.Your child's healthcare provider can recommend specific amounts (based on your child's diet and any other supplements she may be taking) and perhaps brands.How can I find out how much mercury my child has in her body?It's simple to test for mercury in your child's blood or in a hair sample, but testing is not routinely recommended. Following the guidelines above for amounts and types of fish to eat should help keep your child's mercury levels in a safe range.If your child eats fish more often than recommended and you're concerned, talk with your healthcare provider about having a test done. If your child's levels indicate that she's getting too much mercury, your provider or a dietitian can help you change her diet accordingly.This article was reviewed by:Edward Groth, Ph.D., independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazineKeli Hawthorne, M.S., R.D., L.D., director for clinical research for the Department of Pediatrics at the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at AustinCharles R.

Eating fish when you're breastfeeding: How to avoid mercury and still get your omega-3s,https://www.babycenter.com/0_eating-fish-when-youre-breastfeeding-how-to-avoid-mercury-an_10319858.bc,"Should I eat fish if I'm breastfeeding?Many nursing moms struggle with this question. The answer is yes  even if you don't normally eat seafood, consider adding it to your pregnancy diet. But you'll need to choose your fish carefully.Studies show that fish provide an array of nutrients that are important for your baby's development. Most experts agree that the key nutrients are two omega-3 fatty acids  DHA and EPA  that are difficult to find in other foods. Fish is also low in saturated fat and high in protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients that are crucial for a baby's health.On the other hand, you've probably heard that fish contain contaminants such as mercury, which can harm a baby's developing brain and nervous system.Because omega-3s are passed to a baby in breast milk, most experts agree that it's a good idea for nursing women to eat some fish. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that women who are pregnant or nursing eat 8 to 12 ounces a week of a variety of seafood that is low in mercury. But it's hard to figure out which fish are best.Below, we offer some guidelines to help you limit your baby's exposure to mercury while getting the nutrients you and your baby need.How does mercury get into fish?Mercury is everywhere, even in the air we breathe.Some of the sources (such as volcanoes and forest fires) are natural. It's also released into the air by power plants, cement plants, and certain chemical and industrial manufacturers.And mercury has been used for decades in making thermometers, thermostats, fluorescent lights, and many other products.

Fish absorb methylmercury from the water they swim in and the organisms they eat. Methylmercury binds tightly to the proteins in fish muscle and remains there even after the fish is cooked.What are the risks of getting too much mercury while I'm breastfeeding?Your body easily absorbs methylmercury from fish. While the metal doesn't typically enter breast milk in large amounts, the mercury that does make its way into your milk is absorbed by your nursing baby's body at a time when she's especially susceptible to its effects.Many studies have shown that exposure to even low doses of methylmercury can impair a baby's growing brain and nervous system. The results can range from mild to severe. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cognitive skills (like memory and attention), language, motor skills, and vision may be affected.Babies (including those in utero) and young children are generally thought to be most vulnerable to damage from methylmercury. That's why women who are pregnant, thinking of becoming pregnant, or nursing need to pay particular attention to the kind of fish they're eating.Why not just stop eating fish?Fish is too good a nutritional choice. Studies have shown that getting enough omega-3s in utero and during infancy (either through breastfeeding or supplemented formula) has a positive effect on a child's vision and cognitive development.Which fish are best to eat?Good choices include salmon, trout, anchovies, herring, sardines, and shad. For example, 8 ounces of salmon, 12 ounces of rainbow trout, or 16 sardines a week should give you a good dose of omega-3s with minimal mercury.Purdue University publishes a handy wallet card that tells you where most commercial fish falls on the mercury contamination scale and how much of each it's okay to eat.Purdue also has free iPhone/iPod apps that can help you track your seafood consumption and estimate your intake of omega-3s, mercury, and PCBs, a group of industrial pollutants that can harm your baby's nervous system.Which fish should I avoid altogether?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EPA advise women of childbearing age and young children not to eat four high-mercury species: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico.Other experts and advocacy groups would like to expand this list.

Pan-fried salmon with baby leaf saladSeared salmon served over a bed of ripe tomatoes and baby leaf salad.What about canned tuna?There's some disagreement when it comes to canned tuna.The FDA says it's okay to eat canned light tuna but suggests limiting your intake of albacore (white) tuna, which is higher in methylmercury, to 6 ounces per week.Purdue University guidelines say it's okay to eat up to 12 ounces a week of canned light tuna but recommend limiting your consumption of canned white tuna to 4 ounces per week.Other experts, like Edward Groth, an independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, recommend avoiding canned tuna entirely. Groth points out that canned tuna is by far the largest source of methylmercury in the American diet.Consumer Reports magazine also recommends avoiding all forms of canned tuna. They've found that white tuna has consistently high levels of methylmercury and some light tuna has high levels as well, so it's not worth the risk.What about fish caught in local waters?Check advisories from your state or local health and environmental agencies to figure out which fish to avoid and how much of each type it's safe to eat.These advisories are usually indicated on signposts in fishing areas. You can also access your state's advisories on this map, which is kept up-to-date by Purdue University.If you don't find an advisory for local fish, the EPA recommends limiting your intake of it to 6 ounces per week and not eating any other fish that week.What can I eat, other than fish, to get my omega-3s?It's not easy to find DHA and EPA in other foods.Many foods  such as eggs, milk, soy beverages, juice, yogurt, bread, and cereal  are now fortified with omega-3s, but most of these contain only ALA.

The only omega-3 fatty acid in plant foods is ALA.What about omega-3 supplements?If you don't eat fish, you might choose to take an omega-3 supplement. A few studies have shown small benefits in child cognitive development when pregnant or nursing women take omega-3 supplements, but most have shown no significant benefits from these supplements.Omega-3 supplements provide EPA and DHA and are mercury-free. Many contain fish oil, but mercury is not stored in fatty tissue, so it's not in the oil, although PCBs may be.Note: Some women turn to cod liver oil as a source of omega-3s. This is risky. Cod liver oil is very high in vitamin A, which can be toxic at high doses. Another concern is that it's impossible to verify whether the oil has been filtered to eliminate toxins such as PCBs.How much omega-3s should I get each day?The 2015 U.S. Dietary Guidelines suggest that pregnant and breastfeeding women get 250 milligrams of EPA and/or DHA a day by eating 8 ounces of fish that are rich in omega-3s each week.The Food and Nutrition Board (the group that sets the recommended daily intake levels for nutrients) has not set recommended levels for DHA or EPA.How can I find out how much mercury is in my body?It's simple to test for mercury in your blood or in a hair sample, but testing is not routinely recommended. Following the guidelines above for amounts and types of fish to eat should help keep your mercury levels in a safe range.If you eat fish more often than recommended and are concerned, talk with your healthcare provider about having a test done.

Eating fish when you're trying to conceive: How to avoid mercury and still get your omega-3s,https://www.babycenter.com/0_eating-fish-when-youre-trying-to-conceive-how-to-avoid-mercu_10319859.bc,"Should I eat fish while trying to conceive?Many women who are planning a pregnancy wonder about this. The answer is yes  even if you don't normally eat seafood, consider adding it to your pregnancy diet. But you'll need to choose your fish carefully.Studies show that fish provide an array of nutrients that are important for your baby's early development. Most experts agree that the key nutrients are two omega-3 fatty acids  DHA and EPA  that are difficult to find in other foods. Fish is also low in saturated fat and high in protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients that are crucial for a developing baby and a healthy pregnancy.Your body will store omega-3s for several weeks, so it's a good idea to make sure you're getting enough now so you'll have adequate levels when you become pregnant.On the other hand, you've probably heard that fish contain contaminants such as mercury, which can harm a baby's developing brain and nervous system. Mercury accumulates in the body  and takes time to go away once you reduce your intake  so you're right to be concerned about your exposure before becoming pregnant.Most experts agree that women in their childbearing years should eat some fish. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults consume about 8 ounces a week of a variety of seafood that is low in mercury. (For pregnant or nursing women, they recommend 8 to 12 ounces a week.) But it can be hard to figure out which ones are best.Here are some guidelines to help you limit your exposure to mercury while getting the nutrients you and your baby will need.How does mercury get into fish?Mercury is everywhere, even in the air we breathe.Some of the sources (such as volcanoes and forest fires) are natural. It's also released into the air by power plants, cement plants, and certain chemical and industrial manufacturers.And mercury has been used for decades in making thermometers, thermostats, fluorescent lights, and many other products. When these items end up in a landfill, the mercury may be released.When mercury settles into water, bacteria convert it into a form called methylmercury. Fish absorb methylmercury from the water they swim in and the organisms they eat. Methylmercury binds tightly to the proteins in fish muscle and remains there even after the fish is cooked.What are the risks of getting too much mercury?Your body easily absorbs methylmercury from fish and stores it for months. Once you become pregnant, the mercury in your body will cross the placenta, too.Many studies have shown that exposure even to low doses of methylmercury during pregnancy can impair a baby's growing brain and nervous system. The results can range from mild to severe. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cognitive skills (like memory and attention), language, motor skills, and vision may be affected.Babies in utero, infants, and young children are generally thought to be most vulnerable to damage from methylmercury. That's why women who are pregnant, thinking of becoming pregnant, or nursing need to pay particular attention to the kind of fish they're eating.Why not just stop eating fish?Fish is too good a nutritional choice.For example, in one large Danish study, children whose mothers ate the most fish during pregnancy (an average of 14 ounces a week) had better motor and cognitive skills at 6 months and at 18 months than those whose mothers ate little fish. And those whose mothers ate the least fish had the lowest developmental scores.Some studies also show that eating fish during pregnancy may help prevent preterm birth and low birth weight. So you'll want to keep eating fish once you become pregnant, too.Which fish are best to eat?Good choices include salmon, trout, anchovies, herring, sardines, and shad. For example, 8 ounces of salmon, 12 ounces of rainbow trout, or 16 sardines a week should give you a good dose of omega-3s with minimal mercury.Purdue University publishes a handy wallet card that tells you where most commercial fish falls on the mercury contamination scale and how much of each it's okay to eat.Purdue also has free iPhone/iPod apps that can help you track your seafood consumption and estimate your intake of omega-3s, mercury, and PCBs, a group of industrial pollutants that can harm your baby's nervous system.Which fish should I avoid altogether?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EPA advise women of childbearing age and young children not to eat four high-mercury species: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico.Other experts and advocacy groups would like to expand this list. Purdue University toxicologist Charles Santerre recommends that you also avoid eating all fresh or frozen tuna, striped bass, bluefish, Chilean sea bass, golden snapper, marlin, orange roughy, amberjack, Crevalle jack, Spanish mackerel from the Gulf of Mexico, and walleye from the Great Lakes.He also recommends not eating striped bass and bluefish, which can be high in mercury and PCBs.What about canned tuna?There's some disagreement when it comes to canned tuna.The FDA says it's okay to eat canned light tuna but suggests limiting your intake of albacore (white) tuna, which is higher in methylmercury, to 6 ounces per week.Purdue University guidelines say it's okay to eat up to 12 ounces a week of canned light tuna but recommend limiting your consumption of canned white tuna to 4 ounces per week.Other experts, like Edward Groth, an independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, recommend avoiding canned tuna entirely. Groth points out that canned tuna is by far the largest source of methylmercury in the American diet.Consumer Reports magazine also recommends that pregnant women avoid all forms of canned tuna; you may want to take it off your menu in preparation for pregnancy. They've found that white tuna has consistently high levels of methylmercury and some light tuna has high levels as well, so it's not worth the risk.What about fish caught in local waters?Check advisories from your state or local health and environmental agencies to figure out which fish to avoid and how much of each type it's safe to eat.These advisories are usually indicated on signposts in fishing areas. You can also access your state's advisories on this map, which is kept up-to-date by Purdue University.If you don't find an advisory for local fish, the EPA recommends limiting your intake of it to 6 ounces per week and not eating any other fish that week.What can I eat, other than fish, to get my omega-3s?It's not easy to find DHA and EPA in other foods.Many foods  such as eggs, milk, soy beverages, juice, yogurt, bread, and cereal  are now fortified with omega-3s, but most of these contain only ALA. ALA is an omega-3 that provides some health benefits, but not the same ones you get from DHA and EPA. (Most food labels don't specify the type of omega-3.)You may have heard that flaxseed is a good source of omega 3s, but it does not provide DHA or EPA. The only omega-3 fatty acid in plant foods is ALA.What about omega-3 supplements?If you don't eat fish, you might choose to take an omega-3 supplement. A few studies have shown small benefits in child cognitive development when pregnant or nursing women take omega-3 supplements, but most have shown no significant benefits from these supplements.Omega-3 supplements provide EPA and DHA and are mercury-free. Many contain fish oil, but mercury is not stored in fatty tissue, so it's not in the oil, although PCBs may be.Note: Some women turn to cod liver oil as a source of omega-3s. This is risky. Cod liver oil is very high in vitamin A, which can be toxic at high doses. Another concern is that it's impossible to verify whether the oil has been filtered to eliminate toxins such as PCBs.How much omega-3s should I get each day?The 2015 U.S. Dietary Guidelines suggest that pregnant and breastfeeding women get 250 milligrams of EPA and/or DHA a day by eating 8 ounces of fish that are rich in omega-3s each week.The Food and Nutrition Board (the group that sets the recommended daily intake levels for nutrients) has not set recommended levels for DHA or EPA.How can I find out how much mercury is in my body?It's simple to test for mercury in your blood or in a hair sample, but testing is not routinely recommended. Following the guidelines above for amounts and types of fish to eat should help keep your mercury levels in a safe range.If you eat fish more often than recommended and are concerned, talk with your healthcare provider about having a test done. If your levels indicate that you're getting too much mercury, your provider or a dietitian can help you change your diet accordingly.Learn more:Is it safe to take omega-3 supplements when you're trying to conceive?Eating fish when you're pregnantThis article was reviewed by:Edward Groth Ph.D., independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazineKeli Hawthorne, M.S., R.D., L.D., director for clinical research for the Department of Pediatrics at the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at AustinCharles R.

Picky eaters: The No-Fruit Kid,https://www.babycenter.com/0_picky-eaters-the-no-fruit-kid_10331709.bc,"When faced with a picky eater, how do you ensure your child gets the nutrients he needs - without a fight. Our food experts offer strategies for your no-fruit kid.See all eight picky eaters here.The No-Fruit KidThe dilemma: Your little one regards snack staples such as apple slices, orange sections, and bananas with utter disdain.The nutritional concern: Like vegetables, fruits are chock full of vitamins, minerals, and fiber  all necessary nutrients for your child's developing body.Ann Cooper, nutrition expert who revamps school cafeterias around the country and coauthor of Lunch Lessons: If you want your children to try new fruits and veggies, cook, shop, and grow healthy food with them. When kids participate in the process, they're much more likely to try new things.Missy Chase Lapine, mother of two and author of The Sneaky Chef: What kid do you know who doesn't like Popsicles? Make your own with pomegranate or cherry juice to get all those great nutrients in an icy cold treat. I also add a purple puree full of blueberries to meat dishes  like taco filling  to get the benefits of this vitamin-rich fruit.Vicki Lansky, mother of two, grandmother of three, and author of Feed Me I'm Yours: Fruits and vegetables offer a lot of the same vitamins and minerals. So if your child dislikes fruit but does eat vegetables, then she's probably getting a lot of the nutrients she needs. If she eats red peppers instead of oranges, she's still getting vitamin C.Jennifer Iserloh, private chef and author of Secrets of a Skinny Chef: I have one word for you: Popsicles. Make your own using low-fat yogurt and berries. I also find that kids love things like bananas rolled in low-fat sour cream and coconut. Fruit is really versatile.Mango LassiBy Ann CooperLassis are a common Indian beverage and a great afternoon snack or breakfast beverage. Mangos are traditional in this drink, but berries, stone fruit, or any other fruit would be a delight.Ingredients:2 1/2 cups mangos, peeled, pitted, and diced2 1/2 cups nonfat yogurt8 ice cubes2 cups nonfat milk (use whole milk if your child is less than 2 years old)1 1/2 tablespoons honeyCombine all ingredients in a blender until smooth.Makes 8 servings. Sneaky Chef Brainy BrowniesBy Missy Chase LapineThese original brownies (with hidden spinach, blueberries, and wheat germ!) passed the sneaky taste test among unsuspecting kids on The Today Show.Ingredients:6 tablespoons unsalted butter3/4 cup semisweet chocolate chips2 large eggs2 teaspoons vanilla extract1/2 cup sugar1/2 cup Purple Puree (recipe below)1/4 cup plus 2 tablespoons Flour Blend (equal parts all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, and wheat germ)1/4 cup rolled oats, ground in a food processor1 tablespoon unsweetened cocoa powder1/4 teaspoon salt1 cup chopped walnuts (optional)Butter or nonstick cooking sprayInstructions:Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Butter or spray only the bottom, not the sides, of a 13-by-9-inch or a 9-inch-square baking pan.Melt the butter and chocolate chips together in a double boiler or metal bowl over simmering water (or in a microwave, checking every 15 seconds). Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool a bit.Meanwhile, in another bowl, stir together the eggs, vanilla, sugar, and Purple Puree. Combine this purple egg mixture with the cooled chocolate mixture.In a mixing bowl, stir together Flour Blend, cocoa powder, oats, and salt. Add this to the chocolate mixture and blend thoroughly. Mix in the chopped walnuts, if using, then pour the entire mixture into the baking pan.Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool completely in the pan before cutting the brownies. Dust with powdered sugar, if desired.Brownies will keep for a week in the refrigerator, covered tightly.Makes about 30 kid-size brownies.Note: Use a plastic knife for easier cutting if you're going to eat the brownies while warm.Purple PureeBy Missy Chase LapineIngredients:3 cups raw baby spinach leaves (or 1 cup frozen chopped spinach or frozen chopped collard greens)1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries (no syrup or sugar added)1/2 teaspoon lemon juice1 to 2 tablespoons waterInstructions:Wash raw spinach thoroughly, even if the package says ""prewashed."" Bring spinach or collards and water to a boil in a medium pot. Turn heat to low and let simmer for 10 minutes. If using frozen blueberries, quickly rinse them under cold water to thaw a little, and then drain.Fill the bowl of your food processor with the blueberries and cooked greens, along with the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of water. Puree on high until as smooth as possible. Stop occasionally to scrape sides. If necessary, use a second tablespoon of water to make a fairly smooth puree.The puree can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days, or you can freeze 1/4-cup portions in sealed plastic bags or small plastic containers.Makes 1 cup of puree.Note: Double the recipe if you'd like to make extra puree to store for later use. Banana Cream PieBy Jennifer IserlohThis low-fat, slightly sweetened banana cream pie is 50 percent lower in fat and calories than its sugary counterpart. It's also loaded with potassium, vitamin C, and fiber. Finally, a snack that is sweet and substantial.Ingredients:2 large bananas, sliced1 cup low-fat or nonfat sour cream2 tablespoons brown sugar1 tablespoon reduced fat margarine1 teaspoon lemon zest4 low-fat graham crackers, crumbledNonfat cooking sprayInstructions:In a large shallow dish or pie plate, combine sour cream, 1 tablespoon of the brown sugar, and lemon zest. Set aside.Coat a large nonstick skillet with cooking spray. Heat the margarine over medium-high heat. When it foams, add bananas and sprinkle with remaining brown sugar.Cook 3 to 4 minutes total until both sides are lightly browned. Spoon bananas onto sour cream and sprinkle with graham cracker crumbs. Serve immediately.Makes 4 servings.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012. Dietary fat and toddlers.

Picky eaters: The Stuck-in-a-Rut Child,https://www.babycenter.com/0_picky-eaters-the-stuck-in-a-rut-child_10331710.bc,"When faced with a picky eater, how do you ensure your child gets the nutrients he needs without a fight? Our food experts offer strategies for your stuck-in-a-rut child.See all eight picky eaters hereThe Stuck-in-a-Rut ChildThe dilemma: Your kid will only eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, every meal, every day. Or he's mainly subsisting on macaroni and cheese  three weeks and counting.The nutritional concern: Even if what your child is obsessing over is healthy, it's wise to offer a variety of foods to meet all of your child's dietary needs  and to encourage him to expand his horizons on the food front. Though chances are, his food obsession isn't a nutritious one.Missy Chase Lapine, mother of two and author of The Sneaky Chef: Look for a quick fix until it passes. My daughter went on a ranch dressing bender. But traditional ranch dressing is full of unhealthy fat and calories. So I slowly cut the salad dressing with plain yogurt  full of healthy calcium and probiotics (beneficial bacteria)  until her dressing was about half ranch, half plain yogurt. If it's the PB&J dilemma and your kid does crunchy peanut butter, add some wheat germ or ground flax seed. Or serve the same thing with a twist, like peanut butter and jelly muffins.Ann Cooper, nutrition expert who revamps school cafeterias around the country and coauthor of Lunch Lessons: It's all about the choices you give your child. If we have a kid who goes to the salad bar every day, we don't have a problem with that, because we offer local, whole, fresh food to choose from. If you offer a range of nutritious choices  and who's in charge here?  then this isn't an issue.Jessica Seinfeld, mother of three and author of Deceptively Delicious: Read Bread and Jam for Frances, by Russell Hoban, to your kids. It's about a badger who finally admits that there can indeed be too much of a good thing  namely bread and jam.Vicki Lansky, mother of two, grandmother of three, and author of Feed Me I'm Yours: As long as your kid is thriving  and the food jag is a reasonably healthy one  then relax. In some cultures, the diet is very limited. Variety is a relatively new thing.Jennifer Iserloh, private chef and author Secrets of a Skinny Chef: If your kid is a one-noter, just try to make it as healthy as it can be. Is that peanut butter low in fat and free of sugar and preservatives? Serve it on whole grain bread and find a fruit spread with no additives. It's okay if kids are a bit obsessed, as long as what they eat isn't loaded with fat, sugar, and additives  so read labels. You can also try doing a half-and-half combo: Something familiar and favorite with something new and different. Gently introduce new things. Sneaky Chef Bonus BurgersBy Missy Chase LapineIn this version of the traditional hamburger, we managed to sneak in a good amount of nutrient-packed pureed blueberries and spinach per ounce of beef. The familiar taste of ketchup helps override any detectable foreign flavors, and I have yet to find anyone who noticed anything unusual about this burger.Ingredients:1 large egg1/4 cup Purple Puree (recipe below)3 tablespoons ketchup1 teaspoon salt1/4 cup fresh whole wheat bread crumbs*1 pound lean ground beef8 to 10 cheese slices (optional)8 to 10 hamburger buns or English muffins (preferably whole grain)Pickle slices and ketchup to garnishInstructions:In a large bowl, mix egg, Purple Puree, ketchup, salt, and bread crumbs. Then add the ground beef, mixing with hands until well combined. If the mixture is too sticky, add a few more bread crumbs.With damp hands, shape mixture into 8 to 10 patties that are fairly thin. The burgers may be prepared a day ahead to this point and kept covered in the refrigerator. If you are not freezing for future use, proceed to next steps.Spray a large skillet or grill pan with nonstick cooking spray and set over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Cook the burgers for 3 minutes on each side, then flip and add cheese (optional) to melt over patties for another 3 minutes.Serve on soft hamburger buns or English muffins with ketchup and pickles.Makes 8 to 10 burgers.*Whole wheat bread crumbs can be found in natural and organic food stores, but you can easily make your own by pulsing whole grain bread in a food processor to achieve fine crumbs. It's that simple. Three slices of bread will yield about 1 cup of fresh crumbs. They keep for months in a sealed bag in the freezer.Purple PureeBy Missy Chase LapineIngredients:3 cups raw baby spinach leaves (or 1 cup frozen chopped spinach or frozen chopped collard greens)1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries (no syrup or sugar added)1/2 teaspoon lemon juice1 to 2 tablespoons waterInstructions:Wash raw spinach thoroughly, even if the package says ""prewashed."" Bring spinach or collards and water to a boil in a medium pot. Turn heat to low and let simmer for 10 minutes. If using frozen blueberries, quickly rinse them under cold water to thaw a little, and then drain.Fill the bowl of your food processor with the blueberries and cooked greens, along with the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of water, and puree on high until as smooth as possible. Stop occasionally to scrape sides. If necessary, use a second tablespoon of water to make a fairly smooth puree.The puree can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days, or you can freeze 1/4-cup portions in sealed plastic bags or small plastic containers.Makes 1 cup.Note: Double the recipe if you'd like to make extra puree to store for later use. Turkey MeatballsBy Jennifer IserlohI took this American classic to a healthier new level by adding turkey and whole wheat pasta. I haven't met a family yet who doesn't love spaghetti and meatballs, and this is an easy way to introduce your little ones to whole wheat products.Ingredients:1 cup whole wheat bread crumbs1/4 cup sweet red bell pepper, grated1 egg, beaten1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese1/2 teaspoon salt to taste1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper2 cloves garlic, minced1 pound ground turkey, preferably dark meat1 tablespoon olive oil2 26-ounce cans of chopped tomatoes1 sprig fresh basil16 ounces whole wheat pasta, cooked according to package directionsInstructions:Soak the bread crumbs in egg and grated red pepper, breaking up the mixture with your fingers until smooth. Add Parmesan, salt, and pepper, mixing until well combined.Add meat and garlic. Combine with bread mixture until the bread is well incorporated. Form 2-inch meatballs and place on a sheet of aluminum or waxed paper.Heat a large skillet on high heat and add olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the meatballs and cook 4 to 5 minutes, turning occasionally until the meatballs are golden brown on all sides.Add tomatoes and basil. Reduce to a simmer. Cook 10 to 15 minutes, covered, until the sauce thickens and the meatballs are cooked through.Serve with pasta.Makes 4 servings.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011. Unsafe foods for toddlers.

7 new strategies for feeding a picky eater,https://www.babycenter.com/0_7-new-strategies-for-feeding-a-picky-eater_10360322.bc,"1. Jazz up the presentationIt may not be logical, but kids think brussels sprouts taste better when they can pluck them off the stalk rather than pick them out of a pile. And they find fruit more flavorful when it's skewered like a kabob instead of heaped in a bowl.So think presentation as well as nutrition. You don't have to be a gourmet chef to put together a snazzy, kid-friendly plate. It can be as simple as arranging cut-up veggies on a colorful platter and sticking in some toothpicks, or serving a fruit smoothie in a pretty glass instead of in your child's regular old tooth-marked mug.Why it works: ""We eat with our eyes,"" say Liz Weiss and Janice Bissex, nutritionists and authors of No Whine With Dinner: 150 Healthy, Kid-Tested Recipes From the Meal Makeover Moms. If food looks good, our mouths water before we even taste it, lowering our resistance. For kids  who tend to be not only choosy but also sensitive to the way things look  this goes double.Picky eaters (Mom Confidential) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:18Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:18Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Go family-styleIt may be tempting to dish up your child's plate at the stove  that way you can make sure he gets the correct portions. But according to Emma Waverman, coauthor of Whining & Dining: Mealtime Survival for Picky Eaters and the Families Who Love Them, letting your child serve himself can help reduce his pickiness.Important: No short-order cooking! Instead, try to include in each meal at least one dish that even your choosiest eater will accept. And if he skips over the salmon and broccoli and serves himself only bread? Take a deep breath and resist the urge to whip him up a bowl of buttered noodles. Let him enjoy the family dining experience his own way, and try to keep your own worry about his nutrition out of it.Why it works: Letting your child be his own boss at dinner (without catering to him through short-order cooking) removes the fight factor. When meals are dominated by parental cajoling, forcing, or bribing, it makes for a tense environment  and kids balk at the pressure. On the other hand, when mealtime is pleasant and stress-free, kids begin to relax and are more likely to take risks by trying something new.As Waverman puts it, ""Try to make dinner time appealing on an emotional level as well as on a food level."" After days of sticking to carbs, your child may surprise you by venturing into protein-and-veggie land all on his own.If you don't see an improvement, discuss it with your child (but never at the dinner table). ""You can tell him you've noticed he only eats rice and bread at dinner, and you can give some gentle education on what a more balanced meal looks like,"" says Waverman. Finally, ask for his input  he may have an idea for a healthy side dish or two. Of course, if it's his idea, he'll be more likely to try it.3. Try using a food chainFeeding specialist Cheri Fraker, coauthor of Food Chaining: The Proven 6 Step Solution to Stop Picky Eating, Solve Feeding Problems, and Expand your Child's Diet, explains her food chain technique this way: Picky eaters are slowly and gradually offered foods that are very similar to ones they already accept. Gradually, they learn to expand their menus.For example, if your child likes a certain brand of French fries, offer her a similar brand. After she accepts different kinds of fries, move on to a food that's similar in taste and texture, such as baked potato puffs. Once she accepts this, move on to a baked potato. Follow this with mashed potatoes, then mashed potatoes with gravy, then potato pot pie, and finally, quiche.Why it works: Food chaining is customized to your child's preferences, and the pace is as slow as she needs it to be. This will help her feel comfortable with trying new foods. ""When it comes to eating, children balk at pressure,"" says Fraker. ""This technique adapts to them, rather than forcing them to adapt to a technique.""4. Let them get hungryKids have become grazers, expecting a near-constant supply of juice boxes and crackers. Dinner  where more nutritious food is served  can become an afterthought. ""Don't be afraid to let your kids get a little hungry before mealtime,"" says Betsy Hicks, coauthor of Picky Eating Solutions.This doesn't mean they shouldn't have any snacks. After all, with their rapid growth and small stomachs, children do need to eat between meals. But there's a difference between providing moderate snacks and letting food serve as your children's primary boredom-buster.If you find your kids demanding one snack after another, get them involved in an art project, take them out for a walk, or break out the sidewalk chalk. The likely result? Mealtime will become more satisfying. ""There's immense joy in sitting down to a table when you're hungry,"" says Hicks. ""I think a lot of today's children don't get to have that experience.""Why it works: Kids are more likely to eat different types of food if they're hungry, even foods that scare them a little. ""Think about what it would take for you to eat a worm, as they do in some parts of Asia,"" says Hicks. ""It would be scary to you  just as broccoli is scary to some kids  but you'd certainly be more likely to try it if your stomach was empty.""5. Lose the self-blameWhen you see your friend's kid wolfing down spinach and sushi, as your own slowly chews half a slice of bread, it's easy to judge yourself. But remember, pickiness is a trait like any other. ""It's so important not to blame yourself,"" says Emily Rosenbaum, author of Cooking on the Edge of Insanity and the mother of a picky eater. ""Picky eating is not the fault of the parents!""Why it works: Once you shed the self-blame, you can gently help your child stretch his tastes without infusing the process with your own stress. This will free you up to cook with your child's tastes in mind without catering to him completely. Most crucial, you can begin to celebrate and enjoy food with him, rather than viewing it as a measure of your inadequacy. He'll pick up on your attitude, which will help him relax.6. Start the day strongIf you've ever stuffed a granola bar into your child's hand or tossed her a toaster pastry as you both dive into the car in the mad morning rush, you know that breakfast can get short shrift. If this is the case in your home, try giving more priority to the first meal of the day. The options are endless  and not necessarily time consuming. Think fresh fruit, yogurt, low-sugar granola, eggs, and smoothies.Why it works: ""Children who eat a nutritious breakfast tend to make better food choices for the rest of the day,"" says Elizabeth Pantley, author of The No-Cry Picky Eater Solution: Gentle Ways to Encourage Your Child to Eat  and Eat Healthy. It's as if they kick-start themselves on a ""less picky"" path. Plus, kids who eat breakfast have better overall health than those who don't.7. Not working? Consider professional helpSome kids are picky eaters because of a developmental or medical issue, says Linda Piette, pediatric nutritionist and author of Just Two More Bites: Getting Picky Eaters to Say Yes to Food. If your child's picky eating is affecting his health, causing a lot of conflict in your home, or seems particularly severe (or if you're simply at your wit's end and want some professional backup), it's time to talk to your child's doctor. She can refer you to a feeding specialist or nutritionist.Why it works: A feeding therapist or nutritionist can provide an evaluation to help get to the root of the problem and will then develop a customized plan to address it. For example, some children have sensory issues that make them resistant to certain textures, and therapy can help them learn to ways to adapt. ""I have seen countless children get better with treatment,"" says Piette."
8 things nutritionists wish you'd do during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-food-diary,"Between exhaustion, ""morning"" sickness, and ravenous hunger, pregnancy can make it a challenge to eat right. But growing babies rely on their mom for sustenance, so you'll want to make good choices about what goes into your mouth  and into your womb. Read on to discover the eight most important things nutritionists recommend for healthy eating and weight gain during pregnancy.1. Find out how much you should gain""Know your numbers,"" says Jessica Corwin, a registered dietitian and community nutrition educator for Spectrum Health in Michigan. ""We should gain different amounts of weight based on our individual BMI. It's helpful to ask your doctor how much you should be gaining.""Guidelines call for women who begin pregnancy at a healthy weight to put on between 25 to 35 pounds. Women who are underweight or having twins or multiples are advised to gain more, while women who are overweight or obese should gain less. Get the details on how much weight you should gain during pregnancy and why.Those extra pounds are critical for your baby's growth and development. But with a typical baby weighing 7.5 pounds, what's all the rest of the weight for?Here's a breakdown: An expectant mom's breasts add up to 2 additional pounds as they swell in preparation to feed the baby. The placenta and growing uterus add another 4 pounds. Factor in the extra blood flowing through your body  up to 3.5 pounds, which explains why a pregnant woman's iron needs are so high  and 6 to 8 pounds of amniotic fluid and other fluids, and you're starting to feel heavy. Plus, your body will need up to 9 more pounds of fat to use as energy reserves during pregnancy and lactation.2. Exercise regularlyDon't assume that pregnancy is a good time to suspend your gym membership. It's important to remain physically active for your own health and that of your baby. Hitting the treadmill or attending pregnancy yoga keeps your body strong, can help prevent gestational diabetes, and can help you avoid gaining too much weight, which can lead to a too-big baby. Regular exercise also prepares you for the ultimate workout: labor and delivery.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women (who have received their provider's approval to work out) exercise moderately for at least 20 to 30 minutes on most, if not all, days of the week. Unfortunately, many moms-to-be aren't exercising this much.""A lot of my patients tell me they're not active at all,"" says Eleana Kaidanian, a New York registered dietitian who counsels pregnant women.Kaidanian recommends fitting in exercise whenever and however you can. ""Even if it's just 10 minutes of walking around your apartment after each meal, that's 30 minutes you weren't doing before.""3. Drink waterThe Institute of Medicine recommends that pregnant women drink 10 8-ounce glasses of water or other beverages each day. (If it's warm out or you're exercising, drink even more.)When Kaidanian asks her pregnant patients what they drink when they're thirsty, more often than not, they list soda, juice, or coffee. However, it's best to keep caffeine and sugar to a minimum during your pregnancy. (Even 100 percent fruit juice contains a lot of natural sugars.)""Water is the best source of hydration,"" says Kaidanian. If you're not tracking your fluid ounces, just tote a water bottle with you wherever you go and sip throughout the day until your urine is clear or pale yellow in color  a sign of proper hydration.If plain water isn't appealing  or is even nauseating  try sparkling water with various flavors (like lemon, orange, and berry) or water with a squeeze of lemon. Or make spa water: Keep a pitcher of tap water in the fridge and add cut oranges, apples, or other fruit to infuse it with subtle flavor.4. Be diligent about prenatal vitaminsI forgot. It's too big. I don't like it.Kaidanian hears a lot of reasons for skipping a daily prenatal vitamin and accepts none of them. Just take yours, she says, because prenatal vitamins are a nearly effortless way to ensure you and your baby are getting the nutrients you need. Many women's diets are deficient in vitamin D and iron as well as folic acid, which is critical in the prevention of neural tube defects such as spina bifida.""It's hard to meet your nutrient intake every day for every single nutrient unless you're planning out specifically what you need for your body, and most people are not doing that,"" says Kaidanian. ""They make so many kinds of prenatal vitamins now  chewables, gummies, and even mini vitamins for those who find them hard to swallow  there's really no excuse.""5. Avoid gaining too muchGaining too much weight during pregnancy increases your risk for gestational diabetes and birth complications such as c-section delivery and tearing.Excess weight gain can lead to a larger baby, which can make for a harder delivery, says Daniel Roshan, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in New York City and an assistant professor at New York University.""We try to keep our c-section rate down, so we really emphasize diet,"" says Roshan. If an expecting mom is eating unhealthily, he says, ""it's like the baby is sitting around having chocolate all day. He gets chubby. When it comes time for delivery, it's harder for him to come out, so there's a bigger chance of complications.""6. Eat small mealsWhen you're nauseated, the thought of a large meal can really turn your stomach. And later in pregnancy, as your baby crowds your stomach and other digestive organs, eating even a fairly modest amount of food at one time can be uncomfortable.Feel free to focus on eating frequent mini-meals. ""Eating small meals often helps because it constantly keeps a little bit of something in your stomach and keeps your blood sugar even,"" says Ashley Roman, director of the New York University Maternal Fetal Care Center.7. Snack smartStock your kitchen with healthy staples so you can easily grab good-for-you snacks. Wash fresh fruit ahead of time and keep portioned bags of trail mix in your desk at work. String cheese and whole grain crackers are satisfying too. Try whipping up a batch of smoothie over the weekend, then freezing it in individual jars.At night, stick a jar in the fridge to defrost. Come morning, add some wheat germ or flax seed and call it breakfast.""Every bite when you're pregnant is impacting your baby, so if you can include nutrition, you'll feel better about snacking,"" says dietitian Jessica Corwin.8. Learn to substituteIt's fine to give into your food cravings in moderation, but it's smart to give them healthier tweaks  especially if they're becoming frequent items on your menu.For example, if you regularly yearn for pizza, follow Ellie Krieger's lead and make pizza on a whole-grain English muffin with part-skim cheese, tomato sauce, and spinach. ""I craved pizza constantly,"" says Krieger, who hosted Food Network's Healthy Appetite and is the author of Weeknight Wonders. ""That hit the spot without going all out and having a big, greasy slice each day.""Craving chocolate? Krieger suggests stirring a tablespoon of cocoa powder and a bit of sugar into a glass of warm, low-fat milk. ""You get the antioxidant bonus from the cocoa and calcium from the milk, it's the perfect snack size  about 200 calories, and it's filling.""Bonnie Rochman is a health writer who is at work on a book about how genetics is reshaping childhood.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015a.

Failure to gain weight in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_failure-to-gain-weight-in-babies_1621.bc,"My baby isn't gaining weight as fast as he was. Should I be worried?Probably not, but it's a good idea to keep an eye on your baby's growth chart. Remember that while your baby should gain weight steadily  with the exception of her first few days, when she may even lose a bit before quickly catching up  it won't always be a perfectly smooth climb.Your baby's growth rate will speed up and slow down. It may even stop temporarily  when she's ill, for example. But overall you should see the ounces and pounds piling on.If you're at all concerned that your baby isn't gaining enough weight, talk with her doctor right away.What will the doctor do?The doctor will give your baby a physical exam and ask you a number of questions to help determine whether there's a problem, and, if so, what the underlying cause might be. She'll look at many factors in addition to your baby's growth rate to assess how he's doing.If your baby is hitting his developmental milestones pretty much on time, relating well to you, and looking otherwise happy and healthy, he's most likely doing fine.If the doctor finds that your baby isn't growing at a healthy rate, however, she may diagnose him with ""failure to gain weight"" or ""failure to thrive."" The criteria she'll use to make this diagnosis may include:falling below the third percentile for weight on his growth chartweighing 20 percent below the ideal weight for his heighta decrease of two or more major percentile lines on his growth chart since his last checkupBy the way, while failure to gain weight can happen to any baby, premature babies are at a higher risk than full-term babies.If your baby has failure to gain weight, it's very important to find out why. Proper nutrition  especially during the first three years  is crucial for a child's mental and physical development.Your baby's doctor may order blood, urine, or other tests and monitor your baby's caloric intake for a period of time. She may also watch you nurse or bottle-feed to see whether your baby's jaw is working correctly or whether he's having trouble sucking. Sometimes the answer is very simple, and sometimes it's quite complicated.The doctor may refer your baby to a pediatric gastroenterologist, a dietitian, or a feeding specialist for evaluation and treatment.This can be a worrisome and frustrating time. It can be difficult to hear that your baby isn't thriving, but it's important that you don't blame yourself or feel like you're not a good or nurturing parent. What could be causing my baby's failure to gain weight?There are so many potential causes that a doctor could spend months performing tests and studying a baby's diet, health history, activity level, and possible causes of stress before discovering the source of the problem.In general, if your baby isn't growing steadily, it means that she's either not eating well or not absorbing or using nutrients properly. Here are some reasons this might happen:Feeding problems:Your baby may be repeatedly getting tired and falling asleep before he gets enough milk.She may have a weak sucking reflex that leaves her unable to get enough milk from your breasts if you're nursing  or even from a bottle, although this occurs more commonly with breastfeeding.A cleft lip or palate would interfere with breastfeeding. These conditions are addressed with special bottles and nipples and the help of feeding specialists. (A cleft lip and palate are usually repaired over the course of a baby's first year.)Being tongue-tied could make it difficult for your baby to nurse well and get all the nourishment she needs. It can also affect bottle feeding, though that's less common.If you're feeding your baby formula, preparing the formula incorrectly can lead to failure to gain weight.If you're nursing and you've had trouble getting a breastfeeding routine going, your baby may not be getting enough to eat. It's possible that your breasts are not producing enough milk to sustain your baby or that your hindmilk isn't letting down.A third of your breast milk is known as foremilk, which is readily available for your baby. When you start to nurse, your body instinctively releases the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates the flow of the rest of your milk, the hindmilk. This is known as the letdown reflex, and you'll know it's happened if your nipples feel tingly or your breast milk spurts. Hindmilk has more calories than foremilk.If you're stressed out or in pain, the letdown reflex can fail to kick in, preventing your baby from getting hindmilk. When this is a chronic problem, it can result in failure to gain weight. To encourage the letdown reflex, try to find a relaxing place to nurse.Some babies who are fed on a strict schedule rather than on demand (whenever they indicate that they're hungry) can get less nutrition than they need. Most experts believe that it's best to let your baby nurse or bottle-feed for as long as he wants when he wants.Growth CalculatorSee how your baby compares to others in height, weight, and head size.Other common causes:If your baby has been ill, his body may need more calories and nutrients. An illness may also hurt your baby's appetite.He may have chronic gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea, reflux, celiac disease, or a milk intolerance.If you have postpartum depression or several other young children vying for your attention, you may be unable to give your baby the attention he needs to be sure he's getting enough calories.In rare cases, failure to gain weight can turn out to be a result of a lung problem, such as cystic fibrosis; a nervous system problem, such as cerebral palsy; a chromosome problem, such as Down syndrome; heart disease; anemia; or a metabolic or an endocrine disorder, such as growth hormone deficiency. If any of these is the cause, it's important to catch it early. How does a doctor treat failure to gain weight?Once you and your doctor figure out what's causing the problem, you can both set about correcting it by treating any medical issues and increasing your baby's caloric intake, if necessary.Getting your baby back up to a healthy weight may mean supplementing breastfeeding with formula or, for a baby who has started on solids, offering more high-calorie foods. Once she's old enough for them, good choices include whole milk products such as cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and pudding (but hold off on offering cows' milk until age 1), eggs, avocados, whole-wheat breads and pastas, pancakes, mashed potatoes, and hot cereals.In severe cases, a baby with failure to gain weight may need to be hospitalized so that she can receive intravenous feedings and be monitored closely.I'm new to nursing. How can I tell whether my baby is getting enough to eat?If your baby's younger than 3 months old and you're breastfeeding him exclusively, you'll know he's getting enough milk if:He wets six to eight cloth diapers, or five to six disposable diapers a day.He has several mustard-colored bowel movements a day for the first month. After the first month, he may have bowel movements less frequently or even skip a day or two in between.When he's nursing, you can see him moving his jaw and hear him sucking. You may even hear him swallowing, if the room is quiet.Your breasts feel softer after a feeding than they did before.He's gaining about an ounce each day for his first three months. (After that, doctors look for a gain of about 0.5 to 0.6 ounces a day until 6 months, 0.4 ounces a day for babies between 6 and 9 months, and 0.3 to 0.4 ounces a day for babies from 9 to 12 months.For other suggestions, read more about how to tell if your baby's getting enough milk.If your baby tends to get sleepy during feedings, keep him alert during feedings. You can try:gently tickling his feetundressing himchanging his diaper before or in the midst of a feedingengaging him in some quiet playsitting him upright to burp him when you're switching from one breast to the otherIf he doesn't finish nursing on both sides, empty your breasts by pumping so you can keep your milk production up.If you're concerned about your baby's weight or food consumption between regularly scheduled checkups, ask to bring your baby to the office to be weighed once a week. For accuracy, make sure you always use the same scale. You can also get a scale to use at home. Medela rents accurate baby scales for home use. Call (800) 435-8316 (option 3) for information.While breastfeeding doesn't always turn out to be the best option for all moms and babies, don't assume that you should switch to formula because you're having some problems. Ask your doctor for advice and perhaps a referral to a lactation consultant.There are things you can do to increase your milk supply, for example, and tips that may help you help your baby nurse more efficiently. You may well be able to resolve the issues without giving up breastfeeding before you intend to.Does failure to gain weight mean that my child will always be smaller than he should be?That depends on the underlying cause of her poor weight gain. If your baby has a long-term medical condition, for example, it's possible that she may always be smaller than average. On the other hand, if the problem is easily reversed, she may catch up by growing faster than usual for a period of time.Show sources Hide sources AHRQ. 2003.

Your pregnancy diet: The basics of eating well,https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-eating-well,"Fine-tune your diet  even if you already eat wellAlmost all pregnant women need to get more protein, more of certain vitamins and minerals (such as folic acid and iron), and more calories (for energy). If there's room for improvement in your diet, eating highly nutritious meals is one of the best things you can do for your baby's health.But eating better doesn't mean eating a lot. If you start off at a healthy weight, you don't need additional calories during the first trimester. In the second trimester, you need about 340 extra calories a day and about 450 extra calories a day in the third trimester. If you're underweight or overweight to start, you'll need more or less than this, depending on your weight gain goal.Learn more: Find out the best ways to eat for two and get the calories you need.Skip unsafe foodsSome foods can be dangerous when you're pregnant. Steer clear of these foods:Raw seafood (such as oysters or uncooked sushi)Unpasteurized milk (and cheese made from unpasteurized milk)Soft cheese (such as Brie or Camembert)Mexican cheese (like queso blanco and panela)PtRaw or undercooked meat and poultryAll of these are possible sources of bacteria that can be harmful to an unborn child.Learn more: Find out how to avoid listeriosis, a foodborne illness that's especially dangerous during pregnancy. Pregnancy weight gain trackerSee your target weight range for pregnancy and whether your weight gain is on track.Say no to alcoholYou'll need to give up cocktails, too. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause physical defects, learning disabilities, and emotional problems in children, so many experts recommend that you give up alcohol for your entire pregnancy.Learn more: Discover your favorite nonalcoholic alternative from our list of the best virgin drinks.Limit caffeineCaffeine is another consideration. Aim to get less than 200 milligrams (mg) per day (about 12 ounces of coffee). Some studies suggest a link between higher amounts of caffeine and miscarriage or lower birth weight, but this hasn't been confirmed. Just in case, stick to decaffeinated tea and sodas, or choose healthier drinks, such as skim milk, 100 percent fruit juice, or water with a squeeze of lemon.Learn more: Be informed about caffeine during pregnancy and see how much caffeine there is in common beverages and foods.Go easy on fishNearly all fish contain traces of methylmercury, a metal believed to be harmful in high doses to the growing brains of fetuses and young children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends limiting your consumption of fish to 12 ounces a week, which is the equivalent of about two servings.Learn more: Get the facts about eating fish during pregnancy and find answers to all your food safety questions.Take a prenatal vitaminEven without morning sickness or food aversions, it's difficult to meet your nutritional needs with just a well-balanced diet. A prenatal vitamin-mineral supplement helps you get the nutrients you and your baby need to thrive.Make sure the prenatal vitamin you choose contains folic acid. (You need 400 mcg daily before you become pregnant and in early pregnancy. Some groups, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health, suggest boosting your intake to at least 600 mcg once you're pregnant.) Not getting enough folic acid has been linked to neural tube birth defects (NTDs), such as spina bifida. Ask your healthcare provider if you need to take other supplementsCholine is another important nutrient that researchers now believe may help prevent NTDs. You need 450 mg of choline a day during pregnancy. Most prenatal vitamins don't contain it, so you'll have to get it from food or ask your healthcare provider about taking a choline supplement.Later in your pregnancy your provider may suggest that you take iron or calcium supplements to make sure you're getting enough of these key minerals. Some experts also recommend taking a vitamin D supplement throughout pregnancy.If you're a strict vegetarian, have a medical condition such as diabetes, gestational diabetes, or anemia, or have previously delivered a low-birth-weight baby, talk with your healthcare provider about other supplements you might need. A registered dietitian can also help with diet specifics.If you have trouble swallowing your vitamins or keeping them down, search for a chewable supplement or one in a powdered form that you can mix with water. And keep in mind that more isn't always better: Don't take megadoses of any vitamin, mineral, or herbal supplement without medical supervision  they could harm your developing baby.Learn more: See our chart of nutrients you need to help your baby grow.Don't diet while you're pregnantDieting during pregnancy could be harmful to you and your baby. Many eating plans designed for weight loss would leave you low not only on calories, but also on iron, folic acid, and other important vitamins and minerals.Weight gain is one of the most positive signs of a healthy pregnancy. Women who eat well and gain the& appropriate amount of weight are more likely to have healthy babies. If you're eating wholesome foods and slowly adding pounds, you can rest assured things are most likely on track.Keep in mind that when you put on your pregnancy weight may be as important as how much you gain. Healthcare providers recommend that you gain the least weight during the first trimester  roughly 1 to 5 pounds  and then gain roughly a pound a week in the second and third trimesters. (Talk with your provider if you're carrying twins or if you're underweight or overweight at the start of pregnancy  your recommended rate of weight gain might be different.)Learn more: Find out what eating for two really means. Eat small meals frequentlyIt's fine to get creative with your eating schedule during pregnancy. If nausea, food aversions, heartburn, or indigestion make eating full-size meals uncomfortable, try eating small, frequent meals throughout the day. As your pregnancy progresses and your baby increasingly crowds your stomach and other digestive organs, you'll have less space in your body for big meals anyway.If you're most hungry when it's not typically time to eat, go ahead and have your meal when the feeling strikes. Eating in a pattern that works for you will help you meet your nutritional needs during pregnancy.(Snacks in between meals are fine, but make healthy choices as often as you can  junk food offers little more than empty calories.)Learn more: Create a pregnancy meal plan you can live with.Treat yourself to something sweet on occasionAvoid making processed foods, packaged snacks, and sugary desserts the mainstay of your diet, but you don't have to give up all your favorite goodies just because you're pregnant. Try smart and tasty alternatives such as a banana smoothie, frozen all-fruit nonfat sorbet, or trail mix.And don't beat yourself up if you cave in to temptation now and again. The occasional cookie or piece of cake won't do any harm.11 foods to avoid during pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:23Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:23Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Bronchitis (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_bronchitis-ages-5-to-8_68489.bc,"What is bronchitis?Bronchitis is an infection or inflammation of the large air passages to the lungs. (These airways are called bronchi.) When your child has a cold, sore throat, flu, or sinus infection, the virus that caused the misery can spread to the bronchi. Once the germs take hold there, the airways become swollen, inflamed, and partly blocked with mucus.While bacterial infections and irritants such as cigarette smoke and dust can also trigger bronchitis, viruses are the most common culprits in children.What are the symptoms?Your child may first have cold symptoms, like a sore throat, fatigue, a runny nose, chills, aches, and a slight fever (100 to 101 degrees F). He'll develop a cough, which often starts out dry and unproductive but winds up producing greenish or yellowish mucus. He may gag or vomit while coughing.Your child's chest may hurt, he may feel short of breath, and he may wheeze. If the bronchitis is severe, his fever may climb for a few days, and his cough may linger for several weeks as the bronchi heal.Some people  almost always adults who smoke or children who live with smokers  suffer from bronchitis symptoms for months at a time. This is called chronic bronchitis (as opposed to infectious or acute bronchitis), and it's one excellent reason to keep cigarettes out of your house.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.When should I call the doctor?Because the condition is almost always viral, there really isn't much your doctor can do for a child with bronchitis, but call her if you'd like a diagnosis or some reassurance.Do let her know if your child's cough is getting worse after the first few days or so, or if he has a fever for more than a few days, or if his fever tops 103 degrees F. Also call if your child is wheezing in addition to coughing, or if he's coughing up blood.Of course, if your child is struggling to breathe, you should call 911.How is bronchitis treated?If your child's dealing with a bacterial infection, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics. But most of the time  because bronchitis is much more likely to be caused by a virus  antibiotics won't help. The condition should improve in a week to ten days. Here are some tips for alleviating symptoms in the meantime:Give your child plenty of fluids  about eight to ten glasses a day. This will both help relieve congestion and prevent dehydration.Run a cool-mist humidifier in your child's bedroom or play area during the day, especially if you live in a dry climate. Moistening the air may help him breathe easier. (Be sure to follow the manufacturer's directions for keeping it clean. When dirty, the device can spread germs through the air.)Try saline nasal drops to help with congestion. You can buy these over-the-counter. Simply put a drop or two in your child's nostril, then have him blow his nose.Encourage your child to get plenty of rest. Cold weather, dust, and smoke can irritate a child's airways, so provide a clean, warm, smoke-free room for him to recuperate in.Prop him up while he's resting and sleeping, to make breathing easier for him.To ease his fever and any discomfort, give your child the appropriate dose of children's acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Never give your child aspirin, which is associated with Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal condition. Don't give your child a cough suppressant, either. As much as you hate to hear him hacking away, coughing up the mucus helps him heal.To clear out the mucus, your child's doctor may prescribe cough medicine containing an expectorant or recommend an over-the-counter brand. If your child has asthma, the doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator medication to widen his airways or a corticosteroid medication to ease inflammation.Is there any way to prevent bronchitis?Frequent hand washing, good nutrition, adequate sleep, and avoiding others who are ill  all the things you routinely do to prevent illness  will help. If you think your child may be prone to bronchitis or prolonged or severe respiratory infections, ask his doctor whether she recommends a flu shot. And of course, no matter how healthy your child is, keep him away from secondhand smoke.Show sources Hide sources Boston Children's Hospital. 2007.

Common causes of fertility problems in men,https://www.babycenter.com/0_common-causes-of-fertility-problems-in-men_1228908.bc,"About 11 percent of reproductive-age couples in the United States have trouble conceiving or sustaining a pregnancy. About one-third of these cases are due to male fertility problems, about one-third are related to female fertility problems, and the rest are due to factors involving both partners or to unexplained causes.If you've had regular, unprotected sex for more than a year (or six months if you're older than 35) without conceiving, see your doctor. About 65 percent of couples that get treatment for a fertility problem are eventually able to have a successful pregnancy, according to Resolve, the national infertility association.A fertility specialist will usually give you and your partner an initial examination. If a semen analysis isn't normal, or if anything in your medical or reproductive history indicates you need a more thorough evaluation, you may be referred to a urologist or other male reproduction specialist who can recommend treatment and help you and your partner decide which assisted reproductive technology options to pursue.Sometimes, there's a genetic reason for male infertility that could be passed down to children. If your physician wants to rule out this possibility, he may order blood tests and refer you to a genetic counselor to help you understand the results. Read on to learn about the common causes of male infertility and available treatments.Lifestyle factors and medical historyCertain lifestyle choices as well as your medical history can affect your reproductive system and fertility. You may be more likely to have trouble conceiving if you:smoke tobacco or marijuanahave three or more alcoholic drinks per dayuse illegal drugstake anabolic steroidstake certain medications, including testosterone replacement therapy, or drugs used to treat arthritis, high blood pressure, depression, cancer, infection, or a digestive disorderhave a chronic illness, such as diabetes, cancer, or thyroid diseasehave poor nutritionare significantly overweightare exposed to toxins, such as pesticides or leadhad one or two undescended testicles when you were a baby or childhave a hernia in your groinhave had a sexually transmitted infection, such as chlamydia or gonorrheaIf you have any of these risk factors, tell your doctor and discuss what you can do to improve your chances of having a healthy pregnancy.VaricocelesVaricoceles are enlarged veins (like varicose veins) in the scrotum. Varicoceles raise the temperature in the testes, which may affect sperm production.Possible symptoms: Most men have no symptoms, but some may have scrotal pain that varies from dull to sharp, especially after sitting, standing, or exercising for a long period of time. (Your doctor can check you for varicoceles by doing a physical exam or ultrasound.)Possible solutions: Surgery to repair the varicocele, intrauterine insemination (IUI), or in vitro fertilization (IVF) with or without intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI).Ejaculation problemA small percentage of men have a blockage in their ejaculatory duct that prevents sperm from getting into ejaculate fluid. This happens when the epididymis (the organ carrying sperm from the testicles) or the vas deferens (the tube carrying sperm to the ejaculatory duct) are blocked or damaged.Other men experience retrograde ejaculation. Retrograde ejaculation is when the semen enters the bladder instead of being ejaculated out of the penis because the muscle at the neck of the bladder doesn't work properly.Infection, injury, diabetes, neurological issues, congenital defects, or a vasectomy can also cause ejaculation problems.Possible symptoms: There aren't usually any symptoms, though if you have retrograde ejaculation you may notice cloudy urine or little to no ejaculate after orgasm.Possible solutions: IUI or surgery to repair an obstruction, reverse the vasectomy, or remove sperm for IVF.Sperm count or motility problemIf you have little to no sperm, poor sperm motility (ability to move), or abnormally shaped sperm, your sperm may not be able to fertilize your partner's eggs. Problems with sperm production or quality can be caused by hormonal imbalances, disease or injury to the urinary or genital organs, fever or heat exposure, certain genetic disorders, and various drugs and toxins. Possible symptoms: None.Possible solutions: Fertility drugs, IUI with donor sperm (or with your own if your count, shape, and motility are sufficient), or IVF with ICSI.Anti-sperm antibodiesYour body can develop antibodies that lower motility or even destroy your own sperm. This happens most commonly after a vasectomy, testicular torsion (a testicle twisted inside the scrotum), infection, or trauma.Possible symptoms: None.Possible solutions: IVF with ICSI is the primary treatment. You may also take steroids, such as prednisone, to suppress sperm antibodies, but many doctors don't recommend these drugs because of side effects from prolonged use.Unknown problemYour doctor may diagnose you with ""unexplained infertility"" if he can't pinpoint the reason you're having trouble conceiving. Some experts think there may be various contributing factors, such as exposure to environmental toxins, subtle differences in sperm function or the fertilization process, being at the lower end of the normal range of sperm count and motility, or a combination of these or other factors. More research is needed to explore these theories.Possible symptoms: None.Possible solutions: Fertility drugs combined with IUI or IVF.Show sources Hide sources ASRM. 2012. IUI fact sheet.

To make sure, you may have to do some sleuthing. Some parents who suspect something's amiss rent nanny surveillance equipment. But it's often possible to tell whether something's wrong without going to that extreme.You may have trouble on your hands if:Your child seems afraid of the nanny or babysitter and has become anxious and withdrawn. Many times, kids need an adjustment period to get used to a new caregiver. They may cry, pout, or throw a tantrum at first. That's normal. But if your child seems fearful or continues to be unhappy, it's worth looking into.A regular caregiver can never replace Mom or Dad, but a child needs to feel comfortable with his nanny or babysitter. Perhaps your child and caregiver haven't bonded, or the nanny or babysitter just isn't providing the kind of warmth and comfort your child needs. As in every human relationship, having the right chemistry is important. (If you suspect something more serious is wrong, educate yourself about the signs of child abuse.)Your nanny or babysitter seems secretive about the daily routine. How your child and her caregiver spend their time shouldn't be a secret. When you come home, you're probably eager to hear about your child's day. If your caregiver isn't forthcoming about it, either she's not good at communicating with you or she has something to hide. Even a caregiver with limited English should be able to convey the ups and downs of your child's day and will understand why you want to know. Childcare that works for usGrandma? Daycare? Real parents discuss finding childcare that works.Your child has been in one too many easily avoidable accidents. A nanny must keep her eye on your child, and know what he's doing at all times to prevent injury. She may be leaving your child unattended as he plays.You notice she isn't following your requests. Both of you are working together to care for your child, so a caregiver shouldn't act as if she knows more about raising your child than you do.She seems critical of your parenting. Again, you're supposed to be a team. And you should welcome constructive suggestions from your child's caregiver, especially if she spends a lot of time with your ever-changing child. But if you get the sense that the two of you just aren't on the same page when it comes to basic issues like nutrition, sleep, and safety, the relationship might not work out in the long run.Your nanny or babysitter often shows up late. An undependable caregiver will leave you in a lurch time and time again. Find someone who you know is committed to the job and considerate of your needs. Tardiness and unexplained absences may mean she's unreliable in other ways as well.Your child often looks unusually unkempt and dirty. Kids are going to get messy when they play, but if your child consistently has jelly on his fingers from lunch at the end of the day or always needs changing when you pick him up, that's a problem. If your little one's caregiver can't take care of the basics, it may be a sign that she's not on the ball when it comes to meeting your child's needs.Her stories don't add up. Never tolerate someone who steals, lies, or deceives you in any way. You have to be able to trust your caregiver for the relationship to work.Your child is consistently hungry and tired. If your child eats like she hasn't had a bite all day or is so exhausted she can't keep her eyes open, that's a red flag. The caregiver may not be following regular mealtimes or nap times.You simply get a bad feeling about the caregiver. When in doubt, trust your gut. Your intuition is likely to be on target, so if a caregiver doesn't feel right to you, find another one.Show sources Hide sources Child Care Information Exchange. Undated.

Why Hispanic women may struggle with their weight,https://www.babycenter.com/0_why-hispanic-women-may-struggle-with-their-weight_3653760.bc,"What is obesity?When someone has more body fat than is desirable for her height and build, we say she's overweight. If she's overweight by 20 percent or more, she's considered obese.To measure obesity, we use a system known as body mass index, or BMI. Calculated with a formula that takes into consideration a person's height and weight, BMI tells us whether she is at her ideal weight, underweight, overweight, or obese. If the person's resulting BMI is between 25 and 30, she's overweight, and if her BMI is over 30, then she is obese. (Calculate your BMI.)Being overweight, which could lead to obesity, is the result of eating more calories than we burn. Obesity can cause many physical and psychological problems. It's one of the factors that contributes to a common illness among Latinos: diabetes.Obesity may also cause high blood pressure, high cholesterol, joint pain, and many other ailments. Psychologically, being overweight can trigger eating disorders and low self-esteem, especially in teenagers.Latinas and weight management.Among all women in the United States, Latinas rank first in being overweight and second  right behind African Americans  in obesity. Despite the Latino diet being a healthy eating style overall, various social, cultural, and genetic circumstances affect our population and favor our being overweight.First, Latinos are the ethnic group with the least medical insurance coverage. This means that many of us don't visit the doctor as much as we should, and we don't have frequent checkups that could help us prevent this type of problem. And in our culture, obesity isn't necessarily regarded as something negative.Many of us believe that un nio gordito, a chubby child, is a healthy child. And during pregnancy it's common to think that you must ""eat for two."" In addition, many Latinos have not made exercising a regular habit. The thrift geneAccording to many geneticists, excess pounds are not all due to fatty foods and a lack of exercise. Obesity is also influenced by the genes we've inherited. That is, if our mom or dad is overweight, we're more likely to be overweight than someone born of slim parents.Another theory suggests that the Hispanic population, like some others, has a tendency to accumulate fat called the thrift gene. In studies of the Pima Indians who live between the Mexican Sierra Madre and Arizona, certain differences between groups of Indians were noticed by the researchers.The Pimas who lived in Arizona didn't go through periods of scarcity and led a very Western lifestyle. They rarely exercised, and they ate refined products such as flour and sugar. Most of them  95 percent  were overweight or obese when the study was done, and most had diabetes.On the other hand, the Pimas who inhabited the Sierra Madre lived traditionally, fishing and hunting for food and experiencing periods of scarcity. None of them were obese when the study was carried out. That made researchers think there could be a gene that helps people of this ethnic origin store fat when they have enough food so they can use it during times of scarcity.That worked well for our ancestors, but it's not working well for us now, because these days we can obtain food in abundance at any time and don't need to store up for the scarce times. Plus, we don't have to run after our prey like the Sierra Madre Pima Indians, so we're not getting the kind of exercise our ancestors did.Obesity and pregnancyIt's ideal to begin pregnancy at a healthy weight, because the mom's weight affects the baby's weight, and obesity can cause a host of complications during pregnancy in both mother and baby. But if you're already pregnant, a healthy lifestyle and a balanced diet will benefit both your baby and you. It's important to check with your doctor to find out what the right weight gain is for you, in your particular circumstances. How to fight obesityPregnancy isn't the best time to go on a diet, because your baby depends on what you eat for his own nutrition. Still, you can maintain a healthy weight during this time by eating a balanced dietthat relies on ingredients commonly used in our culture, in the right portions, which will provide your baby with the nutrients he needs  and by doing exercise like swimming and walking.The fact that obesity is partly hereditary and that we may be at higher risk of being overweight doesn't mean we have to resign ourselves to being gordita.By Lourdes Alcaiz, author of Waiting for Beb: A Pregnancy Guide for LatinasMore articles for Latinas:How diabetes affects youImportant medical resources for you and your babyHerbs to avoid during pregnancy and breastfeedingIs it safe to use medicines from other countries?Traditional beliefs and myths about pregnancyBaby care tips and traditions"
When you just can't breastfeed,https://www.babycenter.com/0_when-you-just-cant-breastfeed_8485.bc,"When Bay Area parent Charlene Hedge gave birth to her son, she took it for granted that she would breastfeed him. But it was not to be. Hedge couldn't produce enough breast milk, and even though she fed her baby every hour in hopes of increasing her milk supply, her son still wasn't getting what he needed.""They always say breast milk is best,"" she says. ""That I couldn't provide for him bothered me for a bit.""Her son fussed constantly, frustrated and unhappy. And Hedge was exhausted by the hourly feedings. Three weeks later, after consulting her doctor, the nurses at the hospital, and her baby's doctor, she called it quits.""Nature just didn't work for me,"" says Hedge, whose son grew into a healthy, happy toddler. ""I could cry and get really depressed, but it wasn't going to change anything."" So she let the whole thing go.Whatever your reasons for not breastfeeding  health, intense discomfort, or unrelenting frustration  give yourself a break. ""Good parenting is more than breastfeeding,"" says Jan Barger, an international board certified lactation consultant (IBCLC).Did you try your best to nurse your baby? Did you turn to others  a lactation consultant, your midwife or doctor, your baby's doctor, your partner  for help? If so, chances are you've already exhausted all available resources and are doing what's best for you and your baby.What should I do now that I'm not breastfeeding?Give yourself a breakIf you've been dead set on breastfeeding since pregnancy, you're probably feeling disappointed. Just like moms who opt for natural childbirth but end up needing a cesarean, women who want to breastfeed but can't often feel a sense of failure and sometimes blame themselves.Try not to beat yourself up, but do take the time you need to feel sad, mad, or any other emotion you may be experiencing. ""Mourn your inability to breastfeed,"" says Barger. ""For some moms, this is a loss."" Avoid telling yourself that you should've tried for another day or another feeding. ""Some of us have a lot of stick-to-it-iveness,"" says Barger. ""But some just don't. And that's okay.""And even though experts say that breastfeeding is the best nutritional option for babies, it's not right  or possible  for every mother. In 2016, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reinforced the advice to breastfeed if at all possible, but said a woman's doctors should respect her opinion about whether breastfeeding is right for her.Today's commercially prepared formulas are nutritious and even contain some vitamins and nutrients that breastfed babies need to get from supplements, so if you can't breastfeed you can still feel confident that your baby is getting what she needs.Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.Talk about your feelingsIf you consulted a lactation expert through all your nursing troubles, talk to her. Be honest about your feelings. She'll likely offer soothing and consoling words that you should take to heart.Your spouse or partner, good friends, and family members can also be great sounding boards for your feelings. Take a chance and open up to them.Find out about donated breast milkIf your heart's set on feeding your baby breast milk and your child meets certain criteria  like being premature or ill  you may qualify for donated breast milk from a milk bank. Talk to your child's doctor about the possibilities.Can I still bond with my baby if I don't breastfeed?Absolutely. Breastfeeding is a wonderful way to strengthen your connection with your child, but it isn't the only way. At feeding time, hold your infant close to you and make eye contact.One client of Barger's who couldn't breastfeed ended up bottle-feeding her child as if she were nursing him. She held him in a breastfeeding position and had lots of skin-to-skin contact.Remember that your relationship with your child won't be based solely on your ability to nurse her. How you respond when she cries, how often you hold and play with her, and how you are as a parent matters more than how you feed her.Where can I turn for support?BabyCenter's Formula Feeding Mamas group is a great place to find other moms who are bottle-feeding, whether by choice or necessity. Get your questions answered or just meet other moms who know what you're going through.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a. Benefits of breastfeeding for mom.

Failure to gain weight in children,https://www.babycenter.com/0_failure-to-gain-weight-in-children_11429.bc,"My child isn't gaining weight. Should I be concerned?Maybe. If your child has recently been ill, he might have lost a little weight, which he should soon put back on. If he hasn't actually lost pounds but has slowed in how quickly he's gaining weight, it might just be a normal slowing of his growth rate.Overall, however, your child should be gaining weight, not losing it. A look at his growth chart will help you evaluate your child's rate of growth in relation to other children.Of course, children grow at different rates, but if your child has consistently been in the 80th percentile for weight and has just dropped into the 10th percentile, talk with his doctor about it right away. Discuss your child's weight if you think that he's gradually dropping to a lower percentile. In general, though, a gradual drop is less cause for concern.What will the doctor do?The doctor will give your child a physical exam and ask you a number of questions to help determine whether there's a problem, and, if so, what the underlying cause might be. He'll look at many factors in addition to your child's growth rate to assess how she's doing.If your child is hitting his developmental milestones pretty much on time, relating well to you, and looking otherwise happy and healthy, she's most likely doing fine.If the doctor finds that your child isn't growing at a healthy rate, however, he may diagnose her with ""failure to gain weight"" or ""failure to thrive."" The criteria he'll use to make this diagnosis will likely include:falling below the third percentile for weight on her growth chartweighing 20 percent below the ideal weight for her heighta decrease of two or more major percentile lines on her growth chart since her last checkupIf your child isn't gaining weight, it's very important to find out why. Proper nutrition  especially during the first three years  is crucial for a child's mental and physical development.Your child's doctor may order blood, urine, or other tests and monitor your child's caloric intake for a period of time. Sometimes the answer is very simple, and sometimes it's quite complicated. He may also refer your child to a pediatric gastroenterologist, a dietitian, or a feeding specialist for evaluation or treatment.This can be a worrisome and frustrating time. It can be difficult to hear that your child isn't thriving, but it's important that you don't blame yourself or feel like you're not a good or nurturing parent.What could be causing my child's failure to gain weight?There are so many potential causes that a doctor can spend months performing tests and studying a child's diet, health history, activity level, and possible causes of stress before discovering the source of the problem.Generally, if your child isn't growing at a healthy rate, it means that he's either not eating well or not absorbing or using nutrients properly. If your child has been ill, his body may need more calories. An illness may also hurt his appetite. A chronic gastrointestinal problem such as diarrhea, reflux, celiac disease, or a milk intolerance can also cause failure to gain weight.In rare cases, failure to gain weight can be a result of a lung problem, such as cystic fibrosis; a nervous system problem, such as cerebral palsy; a chromosome problem, such as Down syndrome; heart disease; anemia; or a metabolic or an endocrine disorder, such as growth hormone deficiency. If any of these is the cause, it's important to catch it early.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.How does a doctor treat failure to gain weight?Once you and your doctor figure out what's causing the problem, you can both set about correcting it by treating any medical issues and increasing your child's caloric intake, if necessary.Upping your child's caloric intake will mean encouraging her to eat healthful, high-calorie foods whenever possible. Good choices include whole milk products (milk, cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, pudding, soup made with milk), eggs, avocados, whole-wheat breads and pastas, pancakes, mashed potatoes, nut butters, and hot cereals.Read more about your child's nutrient needs.Does failure to gain weight mean that my child will always be smaller than he should be?That depends on the underlying cause of his poor weight gain. If your child has a long-term medical condition, for example, it's possible that he may always be smaller than average. On the other hand, if the problem is easily reversed, he may catch up by growing faster than usual for a period of time.Show sources Hide sources AHRQ. 2003.

Bronchitis (ages 3 and 4),https://www.babycenter.com/0_bronchitis-ages-3-and-4_66364.bc,"What is bronchitis?Bronchitis is an infection or inflammation of the large air passages to the lungs. (These airways are called bronchi.) When your child has a cold, sore throat, flu, or sinus infection, the virus that caused the misery can spread to the bronchi. Once the germs take hold there, the airways become swollen, inflamed, and partly blocked with mucus.While bacterial infections and irritants such as cigarette smoke, fumes, and dust can also trigger bronchitis, viruses are the most common culprits in children.What are the symptoms?Your preschooler may first have cold symptoms, like a sore throat, fatigue, runny nose, chills, aches, and a slight fever (100 to 101 degrees F). He'll develop a cough, which often starts out dry and unproductive but winds up producing greenish or yellowish mucus. He may gag or vomit while coughing.Your child's chest may hurt, he may feel short of breath, and he may wheeze. If the bronchitis is severe, his fever may climb for a few days, and his cough may linger for several weeks as the bronchi heal.Some people  almost always adults who smoke or children who live with smokers  suffer from bronchitis symptoms for months at a time. This is called chronic bronchitis (as opposed to infectious or acute bronchitis), and it's one excellent reason to keep cigarettes out of your house.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.When should I call the doctor?Because the condition is almost always viral, there really isn't much your doctor can do for a child with bronchitis, but call her if you'd like a diagnosis or some reassurance.Do let her know if your preschooler's cough is getting worse after the first few days or so, or if he has a fever for more than a few days, or if his fever tops 103 degrees F. Also call if your child is wheezing in addition to coughing or if he's coughing up blood.Of course, if your child is struggling to breathe, you should call 911. How is bronchitis treated?If your child's dealing with a bacterial infection, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics. But most of the time  because bronchitis is much more likely to be caused by a virus  antibiotics won't help. The condition should improve in a week to ten days. Here are some tips for alleviating symptoms in the meantime:Give your preschooler plenty of fluids  about eight to ten glasses a day. This will both help relieve congestion and prevent dehydration.Run a cool-mist humidifier in your child's bedroom or play area during the day, especially if you live in a dry climate. Moistening the air may help him breathe easier. (Be sure to follow the manufacturer's directions for keeping it clean. When dirty, the device can spread germs through the air.)Try saline nasal drops to help with congestion. You can buy these over-the-counter. Simply put a drop or two in your preschooler's nostril, then suction it out with a bulb syringe. (If your preschooler really fights away the syringe, you might want to wait to use this treatment until he's old enough to blow out the drops himself).Encourage your child to get plenty of rest. Cold weather, dust, and smoke can irritate a child's airways, so provide a clean, warm, smoke-free room for him to recuperate in.Prop him up while he's resting and sleeping to make breathing easier for him.To ease his fever and any discomfort, give your preschooler the appropriate dose of children's acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Never give your child aspirin, which is associated with Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal condition. Don't give your child a cough suppressant, either. As much as you hate to hear him hacking away, coughing up the mucus helps him heal.To clear out the mucus, your child's doctor may prescribe cough medicine containing an expectorant or recommend an over-the-counter brand. If your preschooler has asthma, the doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator medication to widen his airways or a corticosteroid medication to ease inflammation.Is there any way to prevent bronchitis?Frequent hand washings, good nutrition, adequate sleep, and avoiding others who are ill  all the things you routinely do to prevent illness  will help. If you think your child may be prone to bronchitis or prolonged or severe respiratory infections, ask his doctor whether she recommends a flu shot. And of course, no matter how healthy your child is, keep him away from secondhand smoke.Show sources Hide sources Boston Children's Hospital. 2007.

Dealing with a sweet tooth (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_dealing-with-a-sweet-tooth-ages-5-to-8_66886.bc,"If your child pleads for sweets every chance she gets, you may be going crazy trying to figure out how to set limits without making the sugary stuff the forbidden food she will always want. But it's important to figure out how to do this when she's young so she doesn't get into bad habits that will be harder to break later. Try these suggestions from registered dietitian Mindy Hermann.How much is too much?At this age, your child can have two sweet treats a day  one at school (depending on the school's policy) and one at home after school. Those may include two pieces of candy, two packaged cookies, a bakery-size cookie, or a kid-size ice cream cone. If your child insists on having more, be firm and be consistent.School-aged children should be encouraged to manage their own consumption. So if your child asks you for another piece of candy or treat, ask her how many servings she's had already. If she's hungry and keeps asking for sweets, offer her a more healthy snack and explain that eating too many sweets is not good for her because she won't be able to run as fast or play soccer as well, for example.How should I handle dessert?The best approach is to try not to make it contingent on what your child eats or use it as a reward or punishment. That only elevates it to a higher level, making it more important than a meal in her eyes. Rather, let it be a normal part of your child's day, and treat it matter-of-factly.What you allow your child to have for dessert might depend on how your child ate at mealtime. If she eats only two bites of chicken and pushes aside the peas, then dessert should be something healthy like fruit. If she eats everything on her plate, then it's okay for her to have a cookie or a piece of cake. If your child asks for more sweets after she's had her dessert, explain that if she's really still hungry, she can have a sandwich, but no more treats.How do I handle incidental or after-school snacks?If you're headed to the market with your child, be prepared to buy an on-the-spot snack. Try to shop after a meal, and let her know she can pick out one item for her after-school snack or for after dinner. A 5- or 6-year-old will be too young to choose from an entire aisle of food, so pick out two to three items that you find acceptable and that you know she likes, such as chocolate chip cookies and a box of animal crackers. Seven- and 8-year-olds, however, can probably handle a wider choice. When shopping for lunchbox snacks, you might try to buy ones that come in single servings, which makes it easier to ration them out one at a time.Ask your child what snacks she would like you to keep stocked at home, but limit the number of different items to one or two types of cookies and one flavor of ice cream, for example. And stock up on different healthy snacks that are easily accessible after school, especially if you're not there to supervise. (Be aware, however, that some healthy-sounding snacks are loaded with sugars, like granola bars laced with chocolate and artificially sweetened fruit drinks.) What are some healthy alternatives to sweets?Fresh or dried fruits such as raisins, apricots, apples, or pears.Yogurt. Buy it unflavored and mix it with fruit or a spoonful of jam.Smoothies made with real fruit juice, milk or yogurt, and fruit.Cinnamon toast. Spread wheat bread lightly with butter or margarine, sprinkle with cinnamon and a dash of sugar, and toast it in a toaster oven.Graham crackers or rice cakes, spread with peanut butter or cream cheese. (You may want to wait until your child is three to introduce peanut butter, since peanuts can cause allergic reactions in young children in rare cases.)Homemade trail mix made with an assortment of cereals, dried fruit, and nuts.A bowl of hot cereal with brown sugar, maple syrup, or raisins on top.Where can I find out more?To learn more about healthy eating and to ask questions about nutrition, visit the American Dietetic Association Web site."
Your child's feeding timeline,https://www.babycenter.com/0_your-childs-feeding-timeline_10356968.bc,"When do children graduate from a liquid diet to eating solid food? When can they feed themselves? And when, oh when, will they stop making such a mess?Here's an approximate idea of when to expect your child to be able to handle everything from eating solids and finger foods to using a spoon and cup.BabyBirth to 4 monthsEats only breast milk, formula, or a combination of the two. Has a natural ability to root, suck, swallow, and gag. (Not to mention burp!)Red flag: If you notice your baby has signs of trouble with feeding (not gaining weight as expected, for example), or if she frequently arches her back, seems irritable, and coughs or chokes during feedings, contact your baby's doctor.4 to 6 monthsCan start trying solid food once he shows these signs of readiness:Has doubled his birth weight and weighs at least 13 poundsShows interest in your food and may even try to reach for itCan sit upright in a highchair with good head and neck controlOpens his mouth when you offer a spoonful of foodUses his tongue to move food to the back of his mouth and swallow it (instead of pushing it out of his mouth)Tip: Although breast milk or formula provides your baby with adequate nutrition, starting certain solid foods before he's 6 months old could reduce his risk of food allergies.6 to 8 monthsShe still needs breast milk or formula until her first birthday, but now eats small amounts of solid food as well and gradually wants more. Can start practicing drinking skills and hand-to-mouth coordination  without spills  by using a sippy cup.Baby-led weaning: Getting started Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:44Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:44Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Gets better at eating food offered on a spoon.Drinking and chewing abilities improve. Begins rotary chewing (moving jaw diagonally to move food to the side or center of his mouth). Spontaneously starts consuming less liquid and more solid food.If your child can sit up on his own for an extended period of time, he may be able to join you at the table in a secure booster seat. (Though many parents prefer to keep their child in a highchair for now.)10 to 12 monthsHolds cup and spoon and starts self-feeding. Uses her lips to get food off spoon. Handles finger foods easily. Eats a wide variety of foods, including those with different textures.Points at or reaches for food when hungry.Toddler12 to 18 monthsCan use a spoon by himself (though not always very well). Can swallow from a cup. Closes mouth, shakes head, or uses other signs to let you know he's full.18 to 24 monthsMakes less of a mess when eating, but may play with or throw food when finished. Uses a spoon and fork increasingly well.

I have HIV. What happens after my baby is born?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_i-have-hiv-what-happens-after-my-baby-is-born_10415063.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWhat happens if I don't take my HIV medication?Like most new moms, you're likely to be very tired, so it's easy to forget to take your medication. But for any HIV-positive woman, stopping treatment can have long-term effects on health. Stopping HIV medication increases the risk of infections, cancer, and drug resistance.Although it might be hard, it's important to take HIV medication exactly as prescribed. Missing a dose or taking it at the wrong time means that your infection could get worse, leaving you with fewer treatment options in the future.It's also normal to get the baby blues in the first few days after giving birth, so don't be surprised if you feel emotional or weepy. But if those feelings don't pass, or if you feel overwhelmed by sadness, anxiety or despair, talk to your healthcare provider.Being HIV positive may put you at greater risk of getting postpartum depression (PPD). PPD is a serious illness that can affect how you care for your baby and yourself. PPD can also make it harder to remember to take your medication or attend appointments with your provider.What care will I receive after I give birth?You should get lots of support from your healthcare team after you have your baby.Your obstetrician (ob-gyn) and HIV doctor will manage your health and medication. They may also refer you to specialists in mental health or substance abuse, if necessary.Your healthcare provider may also connect you with a social worker or hospital program to help you get services such as:peer counseling (advice and support from another mom who's HIV positive)childcarehousing, food, and transportation supportlegal adviceYour baby also needs planned and coordinated pediatric care with a specialist to help ensure he doesn't get HIV.How soon after birth do I need to use contraception?It may seem too soon to think about birth control if you've just had a baby, but you may be fertile again sooner than you think  even before you've had a period. Use contraception as soon as you start having sex again after the birth of your baby.Most women resume sex 6 to 8 weeks after delivery. If you think you may become sexually active sooner than that, talk to your provider about contraception before leaving the hospital.Even if you hope to have more children in the future, leaving a gap of 18 months or more before becoming pregnant again is generally recommended for all women. This gives your body time to recover from the previous pregnancy and prepare for the next one.Planning a pregnancy also means that your care and medication can be adjusted before you conceive. This gives your baby the best chance of being healthy.What type of contraception works best?Condoms protect you from sexually transmitted infections and from passing HIV on to your partner, but they can be unreliable as a form of contraception. The safest approach is to use condoms in addition to another long-acting birth control method, such as an intrauterine device (IUD) or implant. The pill or an injection may also be good options for some women.What's the long-term outlook for my health?There's currently no cure for HIV. However, antiretroviral therapy (ART) can control the virus and delay the onset of AIDS.If you and your partner plan to have another child, you'll give your family and future baby the best possible start if you can:Stick to your HIV medications meticulously to suppress the virus and stop it from developing drug resistance.Follow safe sex practices and use appropriate contraception until you're completely prepared to have a pregnancy that's as healthy as possible.Get good nutrition and regular exercise.Talk to your provider about family planning and preconception care at your routine health visits.Remember that having unprotected sex risks transmitting HIV to your partner. Protect your partner by using assisted conception through insemination of his sperm at the time of ovulation.If he's also HIV positive, it's safest to use donated sperm, though other options may be available. To find out what's best for you, talk to a healthcare provider experienced in family planning for HIV-positive couples.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2012.

Getting the most from HIV medication,https://www.babycenter.com/0_getting-the-most-from-hiv-medication_10415064.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineHow can I stick to my HIV treatment plan?The most important thing to do is probably the simplest: Go to all your medical appointments. That way, your healthcare provider can help you monitor the medications you're taking, watch out for any side effects, and supervise your general condition.A treatment plan for HIV consists of medications that make up antiretroviral therapy (ART). There's a lot you can do to help yourself stay on track:Talk with your provider about your plan, so you can develop the one that works best for you. Ask for a written copy of the plan, and make sure it details each of your medications, including how and when to take them.Find out what side effects to expect and how to deal with them.Understand how the treatment plan protects you and your baby from infection and helps prevent the virus from becoming resistant to other medication. Knowing this may motivate you to stay on the plan.Talk to your provider about any challenges you face that could affect your ability to take HIV medication. Maintaining a treatment plan can be harder if you're also dealing with substance abuse or alcoholism, unstable housing, mental illness, relationship problems, or other issues.Use a seven-day pillbox to organize pills for each day. Fill it at the start of every week.Tell your provider about your daily schedule so you can plan your medication to fit in with your life, rather than organizing your life around medication.Take your pills at the same time as something else that you do regularly each day  watching the news, brushing your teeth, or arriving home from work.Use your phone to set reminders, either with the alarm or by using an app. The AIDSinfo HIV/AIDS Drug Database App bookmarks HIV medicines, allows you to add your own notes about a drug, and has a daily pill reminder feature.Ask your family members, friends, or co-workers to remind you to take your medicines.Always have access to your medication and keep a spare supply at work. If you're traveling, pack enough to last for the whole trip.Join a support group, either online or in your community. Getting advice and encouragement from others going through the same thing helps.How can I get the most out of HIV medication?Take HIV medication exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. That means taking it:at the right timewith food, or before or after meals, depending on the advice you've been givenevery day, including weekends, holidays, and even when you're in laborTaking medication consistently can be difficult. It helps to keep track of what you take and when on a computer, phone, or in a notebook. The important information to track includes:the name of each medicinethe dosethe number of pills to takewhen to take the medicationWith ART, you'll likely take several pills a day, each with its own requirements.Missing a dose, or taking it at the wrong time, can result in an increase in the amount of HIV in your body, putting your health at risk and increasing the chance of passing the virus on to your baby.Drug resistance is also a problem with regularly missed doses. Drug resistance means certain drugs no longer work to reduce HIV in the blood.What should I do if I forget to take my HIV medication?Don't panic. Call your healthcare provider. In most cases, your provider will say to take the medicine if you just missed it.Discuss medication at each appointment with your provider. Tell your provider if you're having difficulty following your medication regimen.Don't forget to mention any side effects you're having. Side effects from HIV medicines are a major reason why sticking to a treatment plan can be difficult.Let your provider know if your treatment plan is too complicated to follow. Your provider may simplify your regimen to include fewer HIV medicines or to reduce the number of times a day you need to take them.What else does my healthcare provider need to know?Tell your provider about any other medications you take. This includes other prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products. Other medicines or supplements may interact with HIV medication. A drug interaction can reduce or increase the effect of HIV medicine or cause side effects.Tell your health care provider about anything that makes it difficult to stick to your treatment plan. For example, lack of health insurance and alcohol or drug abuse can make it hard to follow HIV treatment. If needed, your healthcare provider can recommend resources to help you address any issues you have before you start treatment.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2012.

(Steam your broccoli lightly, then serve half with dinner and make a broccoli salad with the other half.)Enjoy with dip: Make a low-fat dressing or dip to serve with your fruits and vegetables. Or simply dip them in plain yogurt.Keep it handy: Some fruit  like bananas, citrus fruits, and stone fruits  can be kept in a bowl on the counter (as long as the fruit hasn't been cut into pieces). Fruits and vegetables such as berries, carrot and celery sticks, or broccoli can be kept fresh and ready to go in the refrigerator, stored in reusable produce bags or containers, or in plastic bags with air holes cut out.Top off breakfast: Add fruit to your morning cereal, pancakes, or waffles.Drink up: Make a smoothie with yogurt, fruit juice, and fruits like strawberries, bananas, blueberries, papaya, and mango.Be adventurous: Try a new fruit and a new vegetable the next time you shop for groceries.Learn more:Pregnancy nutrients you need to help your baby growHealthy pregnancy snacksEnergy-boosting foodsShow sources Hide sources AHA.

Best foods for new moms: Mood boosters,https://www.babycenter.com/0_best-foods-for-new-moms-mood-boosters_1458835.bc,"It's not uncommon to feel down for the first couple of weeks after childbirth. You're recovering physically from labor and delivery, dealing with postpartum hormonal swings, and adjusting to life with the newest  and most demanding  member of your family. All this can leave you feeling exhausted, cranky, and anxious.And while feeding yourself may be last on your to-do list, eating healthy food, having regular meals and snacks, and taking a few simple steps can boost yourenergy leveland your mood. Read on for our best nutrition tips.Editor's note: If you suspect you're suffering frompostpartum depression(PPD) rather than a temporary case of the""baby blues,"" tell your care provider right away.PPD is a serious condition that requires treatment. A healthy diet can improve your mood, but it can't substitute for professional help. Warning signs of PPD include insomnia, a change in appetite, weepiness or sadness that persists all day, and thoughts of harming yourself or your baby.Stock up on omega-3 fatty acidsExperts agree that omega-3s fatty acids  found mainly in fish and some nuts and seeds  are important to include in a healthy diet. They help your body function normally and protect against heart disease. And some studies show lower overall rates of depression (including a lower incidence of postpartum depression among new moms) in countries where people eat large amounts of fish.Pediatrician James Sears, coauthor ofThe Baby Book, advises new mothers to stock up on foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like wild salmon, flaxseed oil, and walnuts. He believes these enhance brain function and can help with depression. ""Omega-3 oils really help the brain work better,"" Sears says.The Institute of Medicine recommends women consume 1.1 grams (1,100 mg) of omega-3 fatty acids every day. Breastfeeding women should get slightly more, about 1.3 grams. The following foods each provide about 1 gram of omega-3 fatty acid:1 tablespoon walnut oil = 1.4 grams1 ounce black walnuts = 0.6 gram1 tablespoon canola oil = 1.3 grams1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds = 1.6 grams1 1/2 ounces herring = 1 gram2 1/2 ounces of Atlantic salmon = 1 gram4 ounces of canned white tuna = 1 gramOmega-3-fortified eggs are also an option. Two eggs provide about half the daily amount recommended above, depending on the brand.Consider taking a supplement if you don't like the taste of fish or if you're eating fish less often because ofmercury concerns. (Nursing moms should eat 8 to 12 ounces of cooked fish or canned ""light"" tuna and up to 6 ounces of canned albacore tuna a week, according to joint guidelines from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency.)Omega-3 supplements made from fish oils are considered safe for nursing moms. According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, they don't have detectable levels of mercury or toxins. But skip cod liver oil supplements if you're breastfeeding because they can contain excessive amounts of vitamins A and D.If you're taking a supplement, read the label to determine how much omega-3 fatty acid each capsule contains, and ask your doctor to recommend a dosage for you. Starting with a low dose and gradually increasing it or taking the pills with meals lessens the chance of having side effects like diarrhea, bloating, and nausea. Don't skimp on proteinIt's especially important to get enough protein in your diet now, says Shoshana Bennett, a psychologist on the advisory council of Postpartum Support International (PSI), an advocacy and support group for women with PPD.Bennett says that eating small amounts of protein throughout the day helps keep blood sugar levels even and moods stable. And consuming dairy products, poultry, meat, and fish  along with low-glycemic carbs like nuts, whole grains, and beans  can boost production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter which has a calming effect on the brain.To get more protein in your diet, try having scrambled eggs for breakfast, a turkey or roast beef sandwich for lunch, and yogurt or cheese and crackers for a snack.The total amount of protein you need daily depends on how much you weigh and whether you're nursing. The average range is 50 to 85 grams of protein a day for nursing moms, and 30 to 55 grams for moms who aren't nursing.If you're very petite or on the heavier side, your protein requirement might fall outside these ranges. Check the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food planning tool, MyPlate to find out how much protein you need.These are some good sources of protein:3 ounces chicken, turkey, or meat = 20 to 25 grams protein3 ounces fish = about 20 grams proteinTwo 8-ounce glasses milk = 16 grams proteinTwo 8-ounce glasses soy milk = 14 grams proteinTwo large eggs = 12 grams protein2 ounces Swiss cheese = 16 grams protein1/2 block firm tofu = 14 grams protein1 cup cottage cheese = 22 to 31 grams protein1 cup plain low-fat yogurt = 12 grams protein2 ounces dry-roasted peanuts = 14 grams protein1 cup cooked beans, such as chickpeas (garbanzo beans), kidney beans, baked beans, pinto beans, refried beans, or black beans = 12 to 19 grams protein1 cup cooked lentils = 18 grams proteinDrink plenty of liquidDehydration may make the blues worse. Fatigue and anxiety are actually symptoms of moderate dehydration. So drink at least nine 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day (about 13 glasses if you're breastfeeding). Choose water or noncaffeinated beverages that aren't sweetened with sugar.Also, don't wait to drink until you feel thirsty. (By the time you notice your thirst, mild dehydration may have already kicked in.) This is especially important if you're breastfeeding because nursing can make you extra thirsty. Grab a tall glass of water, juice, or even decaf iced tea every time you sit down to nurse your baby. Limit your alcohol intakeThough it may give you a quick buzz, alcohol is a depressant, so limit your drinking until you're on a more even keel. An occasional glass of wine in the evening to unwind isn't a problem, but regular heavy drinking may make your mood worse and disrupt your sleep. Depression and alcoholism often go hand in hand, so if you feel like your drinking is spiraling out of control, talk to your healthcare provider.There are other reasons to abstain from drinking during the postpartum period. Having more than an infrequent drink can affect yourability to nurseand take care of your child.Moderate your caffeine intakeA cup or two of coffee can get you going in the morning, but if you're guzzling caffeinated beverages all day long, you're more likely to end up jittery, frazzled, and unable to sleep at night. ""Caffeine is public enemy number one  it is horrible for anxiety,"" says Bennett. ""It makes people agitated, irritable, and restless,"" she says, noting that those are also symptoms of mood disorders.Plus, if you're breastfeeding, doctors recommend having no more than300 mg of caffeine a day (about what you'd get in two 8-ounce cups of coffee) to avoid affecting your baby.Abruptly giving up all caffeine can cause temporary headaches, lethargy, and crankiness. So if you drink a lot of the stuff, don't just quit cold turkey. Slowly cut back to a few caffeinated beverages a day  or none if you want to be caffeine-free.Go for dark chocolate when you're craving sweetsIt's easy to reach for junk food when you're tired and need some quick calories, but try to resist the urge. Junk food may give you a temporary lift, but that surge comes with an eventual crash. If you do indulge occasionally, don't beat yourself up about it. ""If you have to eat something with a lot of sugar, eat some chocolate,"" says registered dietitian Jo Ann Hattner.High-quality dark chocolate  at least 70 percent cocoa  can improve mood by increasing the serotonin level in your brain. And some studies indicate that chocolate consumption triggers the release of endorphins, brain chemicals responsible for euphoric feelings.Don't forget your vitaminsAlthough a supplement is no substitute for a healthy diet rich infruits and veggies, it can be difficult to cover all your nutritional bases during those first few busy weeks with a new baby. So keep taking yourprenatal vitaminfor a couple months postpartum.Prenatal vitamins generally contain more iron than regular multivitamins, which is important because your iron stores may be depleted after pregnancy and giving birth (especially if you had a cesarean section). Low iron levels can leave you feeling fatigued and down. Also, antioxidants  including vitamins A, C, and E  may improve overall brain function, according to Bennett.Pay attention to your appetiteIt's normal to skip meals and forget to eat on a regular schedule during the harried first weeks of caring for a newborn. But if you find that you're rarely hungry and eating is a chore, your loss of appetite may be a symptom of postpartum depression.Eating poorly can also contribute to mood problems. Your body needs regular, balanced meals and snacks to keep blood sugar levels stable. When they're not, it can affect your mood. If you consistently have to force yourself to eat, talk to your care provider.More informationThe USDA's MyPlate tool offers a customized daily food plan based on your age, gender, and activity level.Get recipes forquick, nutritious snacks for time-starved moms.See ourdiet for a healthy breastfeeding momanddiet for healthy postpartum weight loss.Visit ourMom's Nutrition: Postpartumindex page.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

Family mealtime struggles: Moms’ best solutions,https://www.babycenter.com/0_family-mealtime-struggles-moms-8217-best-solutions_10381452.bc,"In a perfect world, we would lovingly prepare a beautiful, healthful meal with fresh (but inexpensive) ingredients. Our grateful partner and children would gaze at the food appreciatively, share some words of thanks, then happily dig in. During dinner we'd peacefully share stories from our day. Afterward, we'd enjoy fresh fruit for dessert, and the kids would clear the table.Ha!According to more than 1,000 BabyCenter moms who took our Family Food: Dinnertime Dilemmas survey, mealtime realities are pretty far from that fantasy. Half of moms said dinner is a challenge, and nearly 3 in 5 are worried about their children's eating habits and overall nutrition. Giving kids a varied, nutritious diet and finding the time and money to make healthy meals top moms' list of food-related concerns.But it could be that moms are being too hard on themselves.. The majority said they're having family dinners most nights, making food that's nutritious and homemade, and teaching kids good table manners. Read on for more (and perhaps surprising) survey results.Moms are (still) in charge of mealtimesInvolved, hands-on dads are on the rise, but moms still run the kitchen. The vast majority of moms we askedmore than 80 percentsaid they do most of the meal preparation. Moms reported that their families shop for groceries once a week, and more than half spend $100 to $150 on each trip.Keeping everyone fed and healthy is a big responsibility, and one that moms take seriously. Food that's made from scratch is important to them, and almost 80 percent of moms said their dinners are all or mostly homemade. And whether the meal is made at home or brought in, 9 out of 10 moms told us their families sit down to eat together several nights a week at least.For some moms, family dinner is the highlight of the day. ""It's when we connect as a family,"" said one mom. ""After working all day, it's nice to sit down and have nowhere else to be but together,"" said another.Picky eaters and dinnertime dreadBut many moms said dinner in particular is an obstacle course. It starts in the kitchen, where the majority said they feel like short-order cooks, making different versions of the meal for different family members. Half of the moms said at least one of their kids is picky eater.It keeps going even when dinners served: Half of the moms said dinnertime is somewhat or very challenging. The major pain points are keeping distracted kids focused on eating, handling picky eating, and teaching healthy eating habits.If you have a child between 3 and 4, don't despair if your mealtimes feel particularly crazy-making. Moms said this is when picky eating and distracted dining are at their peak. Said one mom: ""Fun? No fun is had at dinner. Our almost-4-year-old son tries to get up and dance, makes silly noises at the baby, and takes forever to finish eating. Argh!""""I dread dinnertime!"" said another. ""It's the worst part of my day. My 10-month-old eats like a dream, as does my 6-year-old, but my 3-year-old is a constant battle. I do have hope, though, since my 6-year-old went through the same thing.""Moms of babies and toddlers reported fewer problems with picky eating but equal levels of distraction. They also worried more about their kids getting enough to eat.""My child is 17 months old, so dinnertime is always messy and entertaining,"" said one mom. Good manners are crucialA whopping 90 percent of moms said they teach table manners by setting and following mealtime rules. The most common are sitting down together, saying ""please"" and ""thank you,"" using utensils and napkins, waiting until everyone is ready before starting to eat, asking to be excused before leaving the table, and clearing your plate when the meal is over.Moms said they're getting an early start in teaching table manners. About half (52 percent) began when their child was between 1 and 2, and another 25 percent started even earlier, with babies under 1.""My rules are: Everyone tries everything one time. Do not feed the dog. You can always ask for more of something, but after you've tried everything once. After dinner, everyone has to eat fruit together,"" said one mom.Many moms start meals by saying a blessing or prayer. Some have traditions, like sharing the day's highs and lows.Other important table rules moms enforce: no cell phones or other electronics at the table, no toys at the table, and no complaining about the food. Some said their kids must take one ""polite bite"" or a few bites of a food before rejecting it. Others emphasize classic good-manners guidelines like sitting up straight, chewing with your mouth closed, not talking with your mouth full, and staying at the table until everyone is done eating.And while many moms we asked said their babies get a pass on bad behavior, at least one mom said, ""If you throw food, you're done.""Bribing kids to eat vegetablesMoms are tuned in to the message that healthy eating habits start young. In fact, the majority (nearly 3 in 5) are worried about their children's eating habits and nutrition. Moms' main concerns are that their kids aren't eating enough veggies (53 percent), aren't eating a varied diet (41 percent), are eating too much sugar (34 percent), or aren't getting enough protein (28 percent).Asked what they're doing to eat healthier as a family, 75 percent of moms said they're preparing homemade food, 75 percent are trying to serve more vegetables, and 71 percent are serving water instead of soda.In addition, many moms (3 out of 5) said they're buying organic foods, especially fruits, veggies, milk, eggs, and meat. Others are choosing whole grains and locally grown produce or avoiding refined sugar and packaged foods.""I know I can't go wrong feeding my family lots of fresh produce and unprocessed food,"" said one mom.""There's no soda in the house, and I started making smoothies and juicing fresh fruits and vegetables,"" said another.A little more than half of moms said they've cut down on the amount of sweets they serve. But while mothers are concerned about the overall amount of sugar their kids get, 80 percent believe in an ""everything in moderation"" approach to sugary sweets rather than an outright ban.When it comes to information about feeding kids right, many moms said they get enoughand even too muchguidance. Some feel overwhelmed by the sheer amount of nutrition advice they get from doctors, experts, websites, and blogs, especially when it's conflicting.""Sometimes it's too much information. Most of it is common sense, like 'eat your veggies.' There are too many contradicting articles. You'll see one that says juice isn't so bad and one the next day says the opposite,"" said one mom.Another mom said that she knows plenty about what to feed her kids  but that getting them to eat it is another story. ""It's about having the time, energy, and persistence to act on the information,"" she said.Many moms shared this frustration  in fact, one third of moms said they bribe their kids to get them to eat healthy food. That's up 5 percent since we asked in 2009. Parents told us bribing peaks when kids are 5 to 7.Ironically, 4 out of 5 bribing moms promise dessert or sweets to get their children to eat healthy food, as in ""finish three more bites of your chicken and you can have a treat!""But some moms get creative with their bribes, offering extra stories at bedtime, more playtime, a park trip, or games on the phone or tablet as a reward for good eating. Others use fruit as a treat after dinner rather than sugary desserts.When asked which healthy foods their kids refuse, moms most often named cabbage, tofu, spinach, tomatoes, salad, and broccoli. Their kids' favorite healthy foods are bananas, yogurt, apples, applesauce, berries, and whole grain crackers and cereal. Weighty issuesIt's no secret that America has some major food issues. The majority of U.S. adults now qualify as overweight or obese. A shocking number of American children are obese too: 18 percent of 6- to 11-year-olds and 12 percent of 2- to 5-year-olds.Half of the moms we asked said one or more adult in their family is overweight, and 3 percent said that one of their kids is overweight.Moms are seriously concerned about many aspects of eating in America: 77 percent said food portions are too large, 76 percent said junk food is cheaper than good food, 74 percent said too many children are overweight, and 72 percent said that prepared foods contain too much sugar.""It's hard to prepare meals that everyone will eat while making sure it's healthy. Not to mention trying to keep a budget when a lot of times junk food is cheaper,"" said one mom.Moms are divided on whether their kids are eating better than they did as youngsters. About half (53 percent) said yes, while 47 percent said no.But while moms say they're trying to do the best for their families food-wise, they admitted that it's hard to live by these rules themselves. Only 1 out of 5 moms (18%) said they always follow the same guidelines they impose on their children when it comes to eating. And 3 out of 5 moms admitted to sneaking treats for themselves when their kids aren't looking.Many moms rely on restaurants and fast food. Eating meals out is on the rise among BabyCenter moms: 41 percent said their families eat at a restaurant at least once a week, compared to 33 percent of moms in 2009. About half of the moms said their families eat fast food a few times a month or more.One surprising bright spot: school food. Most moms we asked said the meals their kids get at school are healthy. And they don't mind if their kids get the occasional treat at school: 76 percent say it's okay to enjoy sweets for birthdays and holidays.Most moms reported that their kids have two snacks a day, and they feel that's appropriate, though a third suspect their kids have less interest in dinner because of snacking.Genius mealtime tips and tricksThe moms who answered our survey shared a bounty of smart ideas for getting kids of all ages to eat well:""We pretend that we're different animals that like to eat different foods. For instance, that we're a family of lions. Look at our incisors, great for ripping meat!""""Our preschool gives kids the 1-2-3 rule. Number 1 foods are protein, number 2 foods are fruits and veggies, number 3 foods taste good, but they don't help you grow so you don't eat a lot of them.""""Always make kids try everything every time it's served. Kids need to taste things multiple times and appetites change, so we always require at least a taste of foods they don't like the look of.""""Always offer fruit at the end of dinner as dessert.""""Be a good role model.""""My kids can only have fruits and vegetables for snacks. It took a while for them to get used to it, but now they eat more fruits and veggies than their friends.""""Offer veggies first when giving food. The hungrier they are, the better those veggies will taste.""""Don't allow snacking too close to dinnertime.""""Color is key, and fun shapes! I like to use cookie cutters and make fun scenes with the food on their plates. We sometimes pretend to be an animal or dinosaur and destroy whatever the creation is by eating it.""""Cook together and have your kids taste things as you go.""""Do it right from the start. Don't feed your children crap just to make them happy and expect that they'll listen to you later when it comes to eating right.""""Don't cook separate food for your kids. They won't starvejust serve them what you're eating. If they only eat one item on their plate, they'll live. Also, after seeing you eat the foods and seeing them over and over again on their plate, one day they'll probably eat them!""""Don't make a big deal out of the fact that the food is healthy. If it's tasty, your child will eat it. They have no idea that broccoli is good for themthey just know how it tastes.""""Feed them what you eat and live by example. Eat healthy, flavorful foods that you enjoy. Be willing to try foods you used to dislike. You might actually enjoy them now.""""I always make the same meal for everyone in my family and try to make it fun. When my children see me enjoying healthy food, it makes them want to try it and enjoy it as well.""""Encourage kids to eat a rainbow of colors.""""If you and your family have been eating junk food, it may take all of you a little time to change your taste buds. But believe me, kids can be just as in love with healthy foods as they were with the junk."""
10 healthy snacks for pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_10-healthy-snacks-for-pregnancy_10396237.bc,"You had a hearty breakfast before you left for work an hour ago, but your stomach is already growling. Sound familiar? Pregnancy can ramp up your appetite significantly.The challenge is that you get only a limited number of ""extra"" calories per day to play with, but they need to be nutrition-dense.We've put together our top 10 snacks for moms-to-be. They all help meet your need for essential pregnancy nutrients, are easy to assemble, are generously sized, and clock in between 200 and 300 calories. And they're all tasty, too!1. Apple and cheese1 medium apple with hard cheese like cheddar, Monterey Jack, or SwissMost women don't get enough fiber in their diet to begin with, and pregnancy increases your requirement to about 28 to 30 grams (g) of fiber daily. That can be a tall order when you're dealing with morning sickness in the first trimester (or maybe beyond) or that full and bloated feeling later on. To make sure you're hitting the fiber mark, it's smart to include plenty of fruits and vegetables in your diet, which also help to keep you hydrated.One medium apple has more than 4 g of fiber and is just 95 calories. Apples are pleasantly crunchy and couldnt be more portable. Plus, apple peel is full of pectin, a soluble fiber that may improve digestive health.Another must-have pregnancy nutrient is calcium. Moms-to-be need 1,000 milligrams (mg) of this mineral each day. Not only is calcium necessary for keeping your bones and teeth strong, it's essential for your baby's bone structure. And if you don't get enough through the foods you eat or a supplement, your growing baby will take it from your bones. Note: Prenatal vitamins  though packed with other important nutrients  typically don't contain much calcium, so don't count on yours to meet this need.Each 1-ounce slice of cheddar cheese has 200 mg of calcium, netting you 20 percent of your daily requirement. Each slice is about 110 calories and 9 g of fat, so stick to one or two slices.2. Egg on an English muffin1 egg (scrambled or fried) on an English muffin or toastYou've probably been reading lots in the news about vitamin D. It helps calcium get absorbed in the body, and it has been linked to preventing cancer, boosting immunity, and reducing inflammation.During pregnancy it's vital to get enough vitamin D to help support your baby's growing bones and teeth, and to make sure your little one's immune system functions properly outside the womb. Pregnant women need 600 IU of vitamin D daily. Up to 4,000 IU per day is safe, according to the Institute of Medicine.One egg serves up 20 IU of vitamin D. The vitamin D is in the egg yolk, so don't ditch the yolk but do make sure it's cooked through! Other good sources are fortified milk (98 IU per 8 ounces), salmon (360 IU per 3.5 ounces), and canned tuna (200 IU per 3 ounces).Egg yolks also contain choline, which is essential for your little one's developing brain and can help prevent birth defects. You need 450 mg daily of choline, and you can knock out 125 mg with just one egg.3. Homemade trail mix1/2 cup pumpkin seeds, 1/2 cup dried tart cherries, 1/2 cup raw almonds, and 1/2 cup dark chocolate chunks (makes 2 cups; 1/2 cup = 1 serving)or1/2 cup walnuts, 1/2 cup unsweetened coconut, 1/2 cup dried diced mango, and 1/2 cup cashews (makes 2 cups; 1/2 cup = 1 serving)Note: Store the trail mix in the fridge or freezer to keep it fresh.There are many varieties of trail mix you can make, but these recipes offer a tasty mix of pregnancy boosters containing calcium, vitamin D, and the mineral magnesium, which helps build bones and teeth. Moms-to-be need about 300 mg of magnesium daily (depending on their age), and pumpkin seeds offer that amount in just a quarter of a cup. Other good sources of magnesium include cooked spinach, black beans, and Brazil nuts.Trouble drifting off at night? Most women find it hard to sleep at some point in their pregnancy. Dried tart cherries contain naturally occurring melatonin, which may improve the quality and duration of sleep. Try mixing them into your trail mix or cereal for a bedtime snack.Dark chocolate contains heart-protective cocoa flavanols and has been shown to help lower blood pressure. Plus, it contains small amounts of the bone-building minerals magnesium, manganese, copper, zinc, and phosphorus.Make sure to include almonds in your diet  especially if you're not big on dairy products. Per ounce, almonds contain 76 mg of calcium, plus 1 mg of iron and 3.5 g of fiber. And the fat they contain is almost all heart-healthy monounsaturated fat. Snack on them whole, or use them atop yogurt, oatmeal, and salads. Homemade granola with yogurtGranola and yogurt are perfect as a quick snack or breakfast on the go.4. Greek yogurt parfaitA small container of plain Greek yogurt topped with 1 cup blueberries and 2 tablespoons chopped walnutsThere are many reasons why Greek yogurt has become the star of the dairy aisle. It's loaded with protein (it requires twice as much milk to make), boasting about 14 g of protein per 5.3-ounce single-serving container. For the same reason, it provides 15 percent of your daily calcium requirement. It also contains probiotics, which help you maintain a healthy digestive system. All that, plus a smooth and creamy texture that makes even nonfat taste decadent.Topping Greek yogurt with fresh blueberries adds nearly 4 g of fiber and only 84 calories, plus an antioxidant boost. Two tablespoons of chopped walnuts (half an ounce) adds 93 calories, 1 g of fiber, and healthy omega-3 fats. Walnuts also contain the B vitamin biotin, which helps you get energy from the food you eat.5. Veggies or chips and guacamole1/2 cup cucumber slices, 1/2 cup carrots, and 1/2 cup celery sticks with 1/4 cup guacamoleor1 ounce (about 10 chips) of lower sodium tortilla chips with 1/4 cup guacamoleMost women have some swelling in their hands, feet, ankles, and calves at some point in their pregnancy. Avoiding excess sodium will help you beat the bloat. When you've consumed too much salt, your body holds on to more water to help keep the sodium levels in your body balanced. Drinking more water and eating food with a high water content will help you flush the excess salt from your system.Both cucumber and celery are low in calories and contain a lot of water (96 and 95 percent respectively; carrots are 87 percent water). And guacamole is packed with potassium, a vital mineral that helps maintain fluid and electrolyte balance in your body's cells. Make your own to control the sodium mash a ripe avocado with the juice of a lime, then stir in some chopped red onion and cilantro.If you really love your guac with tortilla chips, look for chips with less than 100 mg of sodium per 1 ounce serving.6. Cottage cheese, fruit, and granolaA small bowl of 1 percent-fat cottage cheese topped with 1 cup of diced mango and 2 tablespoons of high-fiber granolaA snack-size cup of cottage cheese (4 ounces) nets you 69 mg of calcium and 14 g of protein for just 81 calories. Mix it with 1 cup of bright, juicy mango and you'll get the added bonus of 71 micrograms (mcg) folate, a B vitamin that plays a key role in the development of your baby's spinal cord and nerves.During pregnancy you need 600 mcg of folic acid/folate daily. Of course your prenatal vitamin will include folic acid, but folate from food sources is beneficial too. One cup of fresh mango also contains almost 3 g of fiber to help combat constipation. Other high-fiber fruits include apples, pears, and oranges.Many types of store-bought granola are high in sugar and don't have a lot of fiber. Look for one with at least 3 g of fiber per 1/3 cup serving and no more than 9 g of sugar.7. Mashed avocado on crackersHalf an avocado spread onto 1 slice of rye crisp bread or crackersIf you've been plagued by leg cramps during your pregnancy, it's time to eat more avocado. A lack of potassium can cause leg muscles to cramp. And as mentioned above, avocado is a potassium powerhouse. (Half of this creamy, delicious fruit contains 345 mg of potassium, 114 calories, and nearly 5 g of fiber.) During pregnancy you need 4,700 mg of the mineral each day, which sounds like a shocking amount, but most fruits and vegetables contain at least some potassium.Keep up with your fiber needs by noshing on whole-grain, low-sodium crackers or rye crisp bread, which offers up nearly 2 g fiber per 37-calorie cracker.8. Tortilla with hummus and tomatoes1 whole-grain tortilla or pita, 1/2 cup halved cherry tomatoes, and 1/4 cup hummusFor something savory in that stretch between lunch and dinner, grab a whole-grain tortilla or pita and load in halved cherry tomatoes and hummus. Tomatoes are super low-cal (just 25 calories per cup) and have a substantial amount of beta-carotene, which is important for a healthy immune system.Hummus packs just over 100 calories per 1/4 cup and provides 3 g of protein, 2 g fiber, and nearly 1 mg of iron, helping you reach your daily goal of 27 mg per day.9. Toaster waffle with almond butter and pear1 toasted, whole-wheat frozen waffle or slice of whole-wheat toast topped with 2 tablespoons almond butter and sliced pearSometimes you just need something to satisfy your sweet tooth. Pump up the nutrition of a frozen waffle or toast by smearing it with natural almond butter, which has no added sugar. Almond butter offers 3 g of protein and more than 1.5 g of fiber in each 98-calorie tablespoon. Layer pear or apple slices on top for some natural sweetness and extra fiber.10. Melon with limeWatermelon or other melon with a squeeze of limeWatermelon is 92 percent water, so it'll help you stay hydrated during pregnancy while also providing a sweet treat. And each cup of diced watermelon has 170 mg of potassium. You can also make homemade watermelon juice by blending it with some fresh lime or lemon juice and then straining the mixture through a fine mesh sieve. Then just chill and sip!Frances Largeman-Roth is a nationally recognized nutrition expert and bestselling author.

Picky eaters: The Veggie Hater,https://www.babycenter.com/0_picky-eaters-the-veggie-hater_10331610.bc,"When faced with a picky eater, how do you ensure your child gets the nutrients she needs - without a fight. Our food experts offer strategies and recipes for your veggie hater.See all eight picky eaters here.The Veggie HaterThe dilemma: Vegetables end up on the floor, in the dog's belly, or anywhere but your child's mouth. Carrots can induce tantrums, beets bring on tears, and broccoli inspires a deafening chorus of ""NO!""s. A classic problem that often lingers...even into adulthood.The nutritional concern: Vegetables are full of vitamins and minerals important for a child's growth and development. They contain chemicals that promote healthy cells and heal wounds; protect eyes, skin, and bones; and help ward off disease and infection. Veggies also contain fiber, which keeps digestion running smoothly and helps stabilize blood sugar.Ellyn Satter: Studies show it can take 15 to 20 exposures before a child will try something new. Repeated neutral exposure is key. No encouraging, forcing, or coercing.Missy Chase Lapine: I find that vegetable purees disguised in dishes I know my children will eat does the trick. The key is that these purees should create no discernible change in taste, color, or texture. You can sneak healthy foods  such as spinach, sweet potato, and cauliflower  into foods your kids already love to eat, like pizza sauce, macaroni and cheese, even brownies. Just make sure there are no lumps, chunks, specks, or flecks, and they won't know the difference. When you puree, unlike with juicing, you don't lose the pulp, so you keep the fiber. In fact, pureeing produces a concentrated version of the vegetable, which makes it even more nutrient dense. So a little goes a long way.Picky eaters (Mom Confidential) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:18Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:18Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosAnn Cooper: We get kids involved in growing food, and preparing and cooking meals. If they feel an investment in the process, they'll eat foods from the garden.Jessica Seinfeld: Take the topic of nutrition off the table and put it in your kids' bodies where it belongs. If my strong-willed children sense I want them to eat their vegetables, it's not going to happen. So mostly I hide them. Sometimes I make it a novelty. For example, my kids love green eggs  scrambled eggs cooked with pureed spinach. They're fast, simple, and nutritious, and we read Dr. Seuss' Green Eggs and Ham.Vicki Lansky: Raw vegetables often meet with less resistance than those that are cooked. Some kids love nibbling on frozen green peas straight from the bag. Add condiments like ketchup, ranch dressing, or yogurt dip  you can make simple, healthy versions of your own at home  and watch your toddler attack the hors d'oeuvres. Offer a variety of veggies: Carrot and celery sticks, cucumber spears, sugar snap peas, and red, yellow, or orange pepper strips are popular with kids.Jennifer Iserloh: Sometimes, it's just a matter of a different preparation of the same food. Try using a mandoline to make thin raw vegetable strips. I cut the veggies in my chicken noodle soup into really small pieces, and the kids just dig right in. I worked for one family where the daughter only ate her zucchini cut into butterfly shapes. Whatever works! Juicing can also do the job: Try carrot and apple with beet for a delicious, nutritious veggie-fruit combo. Brownies (with carrot and spinach)By Jessica SeinfeldJessica says: ""These brownies fool everyone! You won't believe how scrumptious they are (or how good they are for you) until you make them yourself. Just don't serve them warm  it's not until they're completely cool that the spinach flavor totally disappears.""Ingredients:3 ounces semisweet or bittersweet chocolate1/2 cup carrot puree (after peeling and trimming the ends, steam for 10-12 minutes and then puree in a food processor for 2 minutes)1/2 cup spinach puree (steam for about 30 seconds, then puree in a food processor for 2 minutes)1/2 cup firmly packed light or dark brown sugar1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder2 tablespoons trans-fat-free soft tub margarine spread2 teaspoons vanilla extract2 large egg whites3/4 cup oat flour or all-purpose flour1/2 teaspoon baking powder1/2 teaspoon saltNonstick cooking sprayInstructions:Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F. Coat an 8-inch square baking pan with cooking spray.Melt the chocolate in a double boiler over a very low flame.In a large bowl, combine the melted chocolate, vegetable purees, sugar, cocoa powder, margarine, and vanilla, and whisk until smooth and creamy, 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in egg whites. Stir in the flour, baking powder, and salt with a wooden spoon.Pour the batter into the pan and bake 35 to 40 minutes. Cool completely in the pan before cutting.Makes 12 brownies. Sneaky Chef Masterful Mac n CheeseBy Missy Chase LapineMissy says: ""This is a nutritionally enhanced version of my stepmother's delicious recipe from Finland. When I mixed in the cauliflower/zucchini (or yam/carrot) puree, which melted away in the familiar creaminess of the cheese, the kids didn't notice any difference from the original macaroni and cheese. Start at 1/4 cup of the White (or Orange) Puree in this recipe and gradually increase it to 1/2 cup over time. For an instant 'quick fix,' use the same purees in boxed macaroni and cheese!""Ingredients:1/2 pound macaroni (preferably whole-wheat blend)1 1/2 cups milk1/4 to 1/2 cup White or Orange Puree (see below)1/2 teaspoon salt2 cups grated colby or cheddar cheese2 large eggs (optional boost)Instructions:Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Butter a 9-inch-square baking pan.Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Add the macaroni and cook according to the package directions, cooking until firm and slightly undercooked. Drain and set aside.In a large bowl, whisk the milk with the White Puree and salt. (If using eggs, whisk them in with the milk mixture.) Put half of the macaroni into the baking pan, and top with half the grated cheese. Next, pour the rest of the macaroni into the pan, and then pour the milk mixture over the top. Sprinkle the remaining cheese evenly over the top.Bake the casserole 30 to 35 minutes, or until golden and bubbling. Serve hot.Makes 4 to 6 servings.White PureeBy Missy Chase LapineIngredients:2 cups cauliflower, cut into florets2 small to medium zucchini, peeled and rough chopped1 teaspoon fresh lemon juice1 to 2 tablespoons water, if necessaryInstructions:Steam cauliflower in a vegetable steamer over 2 inches of water in a tightly covered pot for about 10 to 12 minutes, or until very tender. Alternatively, place cauliflower in a microwave-safe bowl, cover with water, and microwave on high for 8 to 10 minutes until very tender.While waiting for the cauliflower to finish steaming, pulse the raw peeled zucchini with the lemon juice (no water at this point). Drain the cooked cauliflower. Working in batches, if necessary, add the cauliflower to the pulsed zucchini in the bowl of the food processor with one tablespoon of water. Puree on high until smooth. Stop occasionally and scrape down the top and sides of the bowl. If needed, use the second tablespoon of water to make a smooth (but not wet) puree.The puree can be stored in the refrigerator for up to three days, or you can freeze 1/4 cup portions in sealed plastic bags or small plastic containers.Makes 2 cups of puree.Note: Double the recipe if you'd like to make extra puree to store for later use.Orange PureeBy Missy Chase LapineIngredients:1 medium sweet potato or yam, peeled and roughly chopped3 medium to large carrots, peeled and sliced into thick chunks2 to 3 tablespoons waterInstructions:In a medium pot, cover carrots and sweet potatoes with cold water and boil for about 20 minutes until very tender. If the carrots aren't thoroughly cooked, they'll leave little telltale nuggets of vegetables (a gigantic no-no for the sneaky chef).Drain the sweet potatoes and carrots and put them in the food processor with two tablespoons of water. Puree on high until smooth; no pieces of carrots or sweet potatoes should remain. Stop occasionally to push the contents from the top to the bottom. If necessary, use the third tablespoon of water to make a smooth puree, but the less water the better.The puree can be stored in the refrigerator for up to three days, or you can freeze 1/4 cup portions in sealed plastic bags or small plastic containers.Makes 2 cups of puree.Note: Double the recipe if you'd like to make extra puree to store for later use. Glazed CarrotsBy Ellyn SatterEllyn says: ""Cooking carrots draws out their natural sugars, and a touch of brown sugar puts them over the top. With their sweeter taste and soft texture, these carrots are irresistible to little kids and a great way to ease them into a healthy relationship with vegetables.""Ingredients:2 cups carrots: fresh, frozen, or canned*2 tablespoons brown sugar1 tablespoon butterSalt to taste (about 1/2 teaspoon)Instructions:Boil carrots in enough water to cover, and cook until almost tender, about 5 minutes, depending on the size of your carrot pieces. Drain thoroughly. Meanwhile, in a saucepan, melt the butter. Add the carrots, brown sugar, and salt, and cook on medium heat until the brown sugar dissolves. Serve.Fresh carrots work best for this recipe. Peel them first (or buy the already peeled ones), and slice them into rounds or sticks. If you're using baby pre-peeled carrots, you may leave them whole or cut them in half.Makes approximately 6 servings. Sneaky Chef Cocoa Chocolate-Chip PancakesBy Missy Chase LapineMissy says: ""It's hard to convince the mind that these chocolate pancakes are actually good for the body. I've been told they taste like brownies, but rest assured, they have more whole grains, fruit, and, yes, even spinach than breakfast at the health spa. They contain less sugar per serving than what I use in my morning tea, and the unsweetened cocoa in them not only hides the purple color of the pureed blueberries and spinach, but it is said to possess antidepressant qualities, something we all could use on cold winter mornings.""Ingredients:3/4 cups Flour Blend (equal parts white flour, whole-wheat flour, and wheat germ)1 teaspoon baking powder1/2 teaspoon salt2 tablespoons unsweetened cocoa powder1 teaspoon vanilla extract1/4 cup milk1 large egg1/4 cup Purple Puree (see below)2 tablespoons honey or pure maple syrup1/4 cup fresh or frozen blueberries (optional boost)1/4 cup chocolate chipsButter or cooking spray, for greasing skilletInstructions:Mix together Flour Blend, baking powder, salt, and cocoa powder. Set aside. (To store cocoa pancake mix for the future, triple the dry ingredients and keep in a sealed, labeled plastic bag.) In another bowl, whisk together the vanilla, milk, egg, Purple Puree, honey or maple syrup, and blueberries, if using. (If using frozen berries, don't thaw them before adding; this will prevent bleeding.) Add the wet ingredients to the dry ones until just blended. (Don't over-mix.) Add a little milk if batter is too thick. Add the chocolate chips and mix lightly.Butter or spray a large skillet over medium heat. Test the pan to see if it's hot enough by tossing a few drops of water in  it should sizzle. The skillet will grow hotter over time, so turn it down if it starts to smoke. Drop tablespoons or small ladles of batter onto the skillet in batches. Try to get chocolate chips in each pancake. When bubbles begin to set around the edges of the pancake and the skillet side of the pancake is golden (peek under), gently flip them over. Continue to cook 2 to 3 minutes or until pancakes are set. Serve stacked high, dusted with powdered sugar, drizzled with warm maple syrup.Makes about 18 pancakes.Purple PureeBy Missy Chase LapineIngredients:3 cups raw baby spinach leaves (or 1 cup frozen chopped spinach or frozen chopped collard greens)1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries (no syrup or sugar added)1/2 teaspoon lemon juice1/2 tablespoon waterInstructions:If using raw spinach, thoroughly wash it, even if the package says ""prewashed."" Bring spinach or collards and water to a boil in a medium pot. Turn heat to low and let simmer for 10 minutes. If using frozen blueberries, quickly rinse them under cold water to thaw a little, and then drain.Fill the bowl of your food processor with the blueberries and cooked spinach (or collards), along with the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of water, and puree on high until as smooth as possible. Stop occasionally to push top contents to bottom. If necessary, use a second tablespoon of water to make a fairly smooth puree.The puree can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days, or you can freeze 1/4 cup portions in sealed plastic bags or small plastic containers.Makes 1 cup of puree.Note: Double the recipe if you'd like to make extra puree to store for later use. Vegetable Fried Rice By Ann CooperAnn says: ""Fried rice is an Asian specialty made from rice that's been cooked and refrigerated overnight. It's important to allow the rice to dry in the refrigerator overnight so the texture improves and the flavor intensifies. The vegetables in this recipe aren't written in stone  gather your family around the table the day before you plan on serving this and come up with your own vegetable combinations. Add meat, eggs, or shrimp for a heartier meal.""Ingredients:3 cups brown rice, uncooked3/4 teaspoon minced garlic1/4 teaspoon grated fresh ginger3 tablespoons vegetable oil3 eggs1/4 cup shredded carrots1/4 cup green beans, cut into half-inch lengths1/2 cup diced red bell peppers3/4 cup sliced mushrooms1/2 cup peas2 tablespoons light soy sauce1/4 cup sliced green onionsInstructions:The night before: Bring 9 cups of water to a boil. Add the rice, reduce the heat to low, cover and cook until soft, approximately 40 minutes. Once the rice is cooked and all the water has been absorbed, spread the cooked rice on a cookie sheet and place in the refrigerator to ""dry"" uncovered overnight.The next day: Stir-fry the garlic and ginger in a wok or large saut pan with 2 tablespoons of vegetable oil over medium heat, taking care not to burn them. Add the remaining tablespoon of oil, heat, and then scramble the eggs. Once the eggs are scrambled, add the rice and stir-fry until hot. Add the vegetables, soy sauce, and green onions, and cook for 2 minutes to allow the flavors to blend. Serve immediately.Makes 8 servings."
Diet for a healthy breastfeeding mom,https://www.babycenter.com/0_diet-for-a-healthy-breastfeeding-mom_3565.bc,"Many new moms wonder how breastfeeding will affect their diet. You probably don't need to make any major changes to what you eat or drink when you're nursing, though there are a few important considerations to keep in mind:Eat a well-balanced diet for your healthOne of the wonders of breast milk is that it can meet your baby's nutritional needs even when you're not eating perfectly. (However, if your diet is too low in calories or relies on one food group at the exclusion of others, this could affect the quality and quantity of your milk.)Just because your baby won't be harmed by your occasional dietary lapses doesn't mean that you won't suffer. When you don't get the nutrients you need from your diet, your body draws on its reserves, which can eventually become depleted. Also, you need strength and stamina to meet the physical demands of caring for a new baby.Many breastfeeding moms feel extra hungry, which makes sense: Your body is working around the clock to make breast milk for your baby. Eating small meals with healthy snacks in between  the way you may have done during pregnancy  is a good way to keep your hunger in check and your energy level high.Breastfeeding lessons learned: 5 things I never knew Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 6:21Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -6:21Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

A filmmaker and mother of two shares what she wants new moms to know. See all baby videosDon't count caloriesThere's no single answer to how many calories a nursing mom needs. But in general, most women who are breastfeeding need about 500 calories more than moms who aren't  that's a total of 2,000 to 2,500 calories per day.Instead of counting calories, follow your hunger as a guide to how much you need to eat.The exact amount depends on a number of individual factors, such as your weight, how much exercise you get, how your metabolism works, and how frequently you're breastfeeding.If you're concerned about putting on excess pounds, talk to your healthcare provider about your body mass index and what you can do to maintain a healthy weight. How to use a breast pumpLearn about the different types of breast pumps, the basics of how they work, and the right way to use a breast pump.Aim for slow and steady weight lossSome new moms find the weight just seems to fall off, while others don't lose much. It all depends on your body, your food choices, your activity level, and your metabolism.The best plan: Lose your pregnancy weight gradually. Plan to take up to a year to get back to your pre-pregnancy weight.Don't try to lose weight by dieting until at least two months after your baby is born. A reduced-calorie diet in the first couple of months could sap your energy and diminish your milk supply.If you're overweight or obese, you may be able to start trying to shed pounds earlier but first ask your doctor for advice. And be sure to stay hydrated  sometimes dieters cut back on water when they eat less food.Most women can safely lose 1 pound each week by combining a healthy diet with moderate exercise.A sudden, large drop in your calorie intake can affect your milk supply, so don't go on a crash diet to lose weight quickly. If you're losing more than 1 pound a week after the first six weeks, that's a sign you need to take in more calories. Include a variety of healthy foodsVariety and balance are key to a healthy diet. Eating a mix of carbohydrates protein, and fat at meals keeps you feeling full longer and supplies the nutrients your body needs.Complex carbs like whole grains and cereals and fresh fruits and vegetables not only provide more nutrition than processed starches and sugars, they provide longer-lasting energy. And choosing from all food groups is important so you can get the vitamins you and your baby need over time. So mix it up  try to eat something today that you didn't eat yesterday. Strawberry and asparagus saladThis spinach salad topped with asparagus, strawberries, and pistachios is perfect as a light lunch.Choose good fatsWhen it comes to fat, think mono- and polyunsaturated fats. Sources of these ""healthy fats"" include canola oil, olive oil, and fatty fish (like salmon) as well as avocados, olives, nuts, and seeds.Limit saturated fats and avoid trans fats, both of which are considered unhealthy. Saturated fats show up in high-fat meats, whole milk, tropical oils (such as palm kernel and coconut), butter, and lard. Partially hydrogenated oils contain trans fats. Saturated fats and trans fats are both listed on a product's nutrition label.In addition to being bad for your diet, getting too much of these unhealthy fats can alter the fat composition of your breast milk, which isn't good for your baby's health.While we don't know the long-term effects of unhealthy fats on infant cardiovascular health, we do know that in adults these fats negatively affect heart health by raising LDL (bad cholesterol), lowering HDL (good cholesterol), and increasing signs of inflammation. Unhealthy fats also boost the risk of heart attack and death from heart disease.Breastfeeding Problem SolverFind solutions to a variety of breastfeeding challenges, including nipple pain, low milk supply, and more.Take extra steps to avoid contaminantsIt's a good idea to try to minimize your exposure to contaminants in your food (and your environment) while you're nursing. Pesticides, insecticides, and other chemicals that you ingest can make their way into your breast milk.Although research is ongoing, we know that environmental chemicals could affect your baby's long-term health. Here are some tips for limiting your exposure:Eat a variety of foods. If you eat large quantities of one food that happens to be high in pesticides, your intake of pesticides will be higher than if that food is just one of many that you eat.Know which fruits and vegetables are highest in pesticides, and choose organic options if possible. Always wash fruits and veggies well. Or better yet, peel them. As of 2011 the ""dirty dozen"" that tested highest for pesticides, according to the Environmental Working Group, were apples, celery, strawberries, peaches, spinach, imported nectarines and grapes, sweet bell peppers, potatoes, blueberries, lettuce, and kale and collard greens.The fruits and vegetables that had the lowest amount of pesticide residue were onions, sweet corn, pineapples, avocados, asparagus, sweet peas, mangoes, eggplant, cantaloupe, kiwi, cabbage, watermelon, sweet potatoes, grapefruit, and mushrooms.Choose produce that's in season in your area, and buy local when you can. Produce that travels long distances often have more pesticides.Choose lean meats, and remove the skin and extra fat before cooking. Chemicals are stored in fat.Consider drinking filtered water while breastfeeding. The EPA requires that all tap water meet certain standards, but small amounts of many chemicals are found in tap water. Eat fish  but be pickyWhen you're nursing, it's important to get protein from a variety of sources  including fish. The American Heart Association recommends fish for a heart-healthy diet.Some fish (especially cold water fish) also contain DHA and EPA, omega-3 fats that play an important role in the brain and eye development that continues during your baby's first year. (Your baby gets these omega-3s from your breast milk.)Not only does DHA help your baby, but it helps you too. Research suggests that moms who have lower levels of DHA, as well as lower seafood consumption, are more likely to develop postpartum depression.Eat up to 12 ounces of most types of fish and seafood per week, including salmon, shrimp, canned light tuna, lake trout, tilapia, catfish, crab, pollack, and scallops.If you don't like seafood, try an omega-3 supplement. Just be sure to talk to your healthcare provider first to find out how much to take.Also, be aware that some types of fish contain contaminants that can be harmful to pregnant and nursing women and children. The Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Agriculture advise not eating shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury.Solid white or albacore tuna tends to be higher in mercury than other types of canned tuna. If you eat solid white or albacore tuna, limit your intake to 6 ounces per week.Other experts and advocacy groups are even more cautious, expanding the list of fish to avoid. Read more about eating fish when you're breastfeeding. Pan-fried salmon with baby leaf saladSeared salmon served over a bed of ripe tomatoes and baby leaf salad.Go easy on the alcoholIf you time it right, an occasional drink probably won't harm your breastfeeding baby, but in general you may want to hold off on drinking alcohol while you're breastfeeding. Alcohol does enter your breast milk, and having as little as one drink may affect your milk letdown reflex.Studies show that babies consume less milk in the four hours after you have an alcoholic beverage. And your baby may become drowsy and fall asleep more quickly after you have a drink, but he'll also sleep for a shorter amount of time. (And, of course, heavy drinking makes you unable to safely care for your baby.)If you're going to enjoy an occasional alcoholic beverage, keep in mind that it takes two to three hours for your body to eliminate the alcohol in one serving of beer or wine. Specific time frames depend on your size and how much you drink, but the more you drink the longer it takes your body to get rid of it. So you might want to time that toast for right after a feeding session.Alcohol isn't stored in breast milk  instead, the level increases and decreases just as it does in your bloodstream. If you have an alcoholic drink, wait at least two hours before breastfeeding your baby or you may need to ""pump and dump."" If you plan to have a drink with alcohol, either breastfeed your baby or express your milk first and store it for later.If you're a breastfeeding mom who supplements late-night feedings with formula, another option is to wait until your baby goes down for the night before you drink alcohol.Also, drink water with your alcoholic drink, and eat before (or while) you drink to help lower the amount of alcohol in your blood and your milk. Drink plenty of water and limit caffeineWhen you're breastfeeding, your body needs plenty of fluid, but there's no need to keep a record of how much you drink. A good guideline to follow is drink to satisfy thirst  that is, drink whenever you feel the need. If your urine is clear or light yellow, it's a good sign that you're well hydrated.Speaking of fluids, it's okay to have your morning cup of coffee while breastfeeding if you like, but don't overdo it. A small amount of caffeine winds up in your breast milk, and it can accumulate in your baby's system because she can't easily break it down and excrete it.Most experts suggest that nursing moms limit their consumption of caffeine (including coffee, tea, soft drinks, energy drinks, chocolate, and coffee ice cream) to no more than 300 mg per day. That's about as much as you'd get in three 5-ounce cups of coffee. You may want to drink even less if you're nursing a newborn or preterm baby. Check out our caffeine chart to see how much caffeine is in popular beverages and foods.Consider the flavors of what you eat and drinkMost nursing moms can eat a wide variety of foods while nursing  including spicy foods  without any objection from their baby. In fact, some experts believe that babies enjoy a variety of flavors in their breast milk. Eating your favorite foods while you're nursing gives your baby a ""taste"" of your diet and may help him accept different foods once he starts eating solids.But some moms swear that certain foods  like broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts, dairy products, chocolate, citrus, garlic, or chili pepper  make their breastfed baby gassy or irritable. If your baby seems consistently uncomfortable after you eat a particular food, then by all means avoid it to see if your baby is happier.In rare instances, your baby may be allergic to something you've eaten. If this is the case, you may notice a reaction on his skin (rash or hives), in his breathing (wheezing or congestion), or in his stools (green or mucousy). Keep taking your vitaminsIt's a good idea to continue taking your prenatal vitamin while you're breastfeeding  at least for the first month or so. After that, you can switch to a regular multivitamin and mineral supplement or stay on your prenatal vitamin, depending on your individual needs. (You can discuss this with your healthcare provider at your first postpartum visit.)A supplement doesn't take the place of a well-balanced diet, but it can provide some extra insurance on those days when taking care of your new baby keeps you from eating as well as you'd like.In addition to your prenatal vitamin or multivitamin, consider taking the following supplements:Calcium: While your prenatal vitamin or multivitamin may have small amounts of calcium, but you'll need supplemental calcium if you're not eating at least three daily servings of calcium-rich foods (like milk and other dairy products, canned fish, or calcium-fortified foods like cereals, juices, soy and rice beverages, and breads).The recommended dose for women before, during, and after pregnancy is 1,000 milligrams (mg) daily. (Teenage mothers need 1,300 mg daily.)Don't get more than 2,500 mg daily from all sources. Exceeding this safe upper limit can lead to kidney stones, hypercalcemia, and renal insufficiency syndrome. It can also interfere with your body's absorption of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc.If you're going to take calcium, also be sure to supplement with vitamin D.Vitamin D: This vitamin is important for bone growth and overall health. Vitamin D also helps your body absorb calcium, and research suggests it may lower the risk of osteoporosis, high blood pressure, diabetes, and several autoimmune diseases.Sun exposure helps your body produce vitamin D, but many women don't get enough sun (especially in the winter and with the use of sunscreen) to make an adequate amount, and experts think the small amount found in food might not be enough. The best way to know whether you're getting enough vitamin D is to have your blood tested.The 2010 U.S. Dietary Guidelines and Institute of Medicine both recommend that all women get 600 IU (15 micrograms) of vitamin D daily, but no more than 4,000 IU. Very large amounts of vitamin D  more than 10,000 IU daily  may cause kidney and tissue damage.By the way, breast milk doesn't supply your baby with enough vitamin D. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies who are exclusively breastfed or who drink less than 32 ounces of formula daily receive a supplement of 400 IU (10 micrograms) of vitamin D each day too. Talk to your baby's doctor about a vitamin D supplement.Vitamin D is important for bone development and the prevention of rickets in children. Experts think that getting enough vitamin D in childhood may also help prevent certain conditions, like osteoarthritis, from developing later in life.DHA: The DHA content of your breast milk depends on your diet, particularly on whether you eat fish. So if your diet doesn't contain a few servings of cold water fish or other food containing DHA (like fortified eggs) every week, you might consider a supplement.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfeeding moms get 200 to 300 mg of DHA a day.Daily food and meal plans for breastfeeding momsChart of daily food group servings for breastfeeding moms.Sample meal plans for breastfeeding moms.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

How to talk to your child about drugs (ages 6 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-talk-to-your-child-about-drugs-ages-6-to-8_67916.bc,"What to expect at this ageKids this age vary widely in their knowledge of and curiosity about illicit drugs. Some barely know they exist; others may have heard about pot or other drugs from older kids. In either case, this is the right time to build a foundation that will help your child resist drugs later. State your values firmly, continue to work on establishing good communication with your child, and, above all, set an example by taking good care of yourself physically and avoiding drugs, cigarettes, and the overuse of alcohol.How to talk about itTeach your child that some drugs are bad. By now, your child knows that there are plenty of things he shouldn't eat or drink  like household cleaners or someone else's medicine. Now you can teach him that some drugs are not at all like medicine; they're so dangerous that it's against the law to use them. If he asks about specific drugs, you can go into more detail, but you don't have to teach your 7-year-old the names of all the different illicit substances.Be approachable. Although you're probably not having in-depth discussions about drugs with your grade-schooler, now is the time to establish yourself as a parent who will answer any question  no matter how challenging or alarming  calmly and thoughtfully. By the time your child reaches middle school and starts to have serious questions about drug use, it helps to have already had a history of heart-to-heart talks.Talk about good health. When your child asks, for the tenth time, for another piece of candy after school, resist the temptation to snap, ""I told you already, no candy before dinner!"" Instead, explain your rule  even if you feel like you explain it every single day  and make sure your answer teaches him about health and nutrition: ""Why can't you have more candy right now? Because too much sugar is bad for your body. It won't make you healthy and strong, but it will tire you out and hurt your teeth. And if you eat a lot of sugary snacks before dinner, you won't have room in your tummy for healthy foods."" If you've taught him the importance of respecting and taking care of his body all along, when he's older he'll be less likely to want to risk drug use.Teach him how to say no. If your grade-schooler can assert his views confidently, he'll be better able to withstand the peer pressure of the preteen and teen years, when experimentation with drugs is a present danger. Listen to him when he states his opinions, and when you disagree with him, do so politely and respectfully. Kids who consistently hear, ""That's a silly idea, why would anyone think that?"" or ""Don't you argue with me!"" are, as teens, less sure of themselves, more rebellious, and less able to heed those inner voices preaching good sense.Make sure your values are clear. You might think your child is aware of your beliefs about drugs, alcohol, and other dangerous substances, but he can't learn them through osmosis. It's your job, as the parent, to communicate your values clearly. You can let your grade-schooler know that you value self-discipline, which will help him withstand the dangers of drugs when he's older. You don't need to lecture. It's enough to let him see that you can withstand temptations (at least most of the time). ""Mmmm,"" you can say after finishing dessert, ""That bowl of ice cream was good. And it was just the right amount. Eating more would be bad for my body and might even make me sick.""Reassure your child that you approve of him. Children are more vulnerable to drug use if their self-esteem is low or if they're starved for affection and attention. Spend time together: Studies show that children who eat at least one meal a day with their family and share at least one activity weekly are less likely to use drugs than those who don't. Be sure to keep telling your child how much you love him, and praise him genuinely whenever he deserves it. What kids ask ... What parents answer""What are drugs?"" Since drug education starts early in many public schools, your 7-year-old may come home and proudly state, ""I'm against drugs!"" and, in the next breath, ask, ""What's a drug?"" You can tell him, ""Some drugs are good drugs, like the medicines our doctor gives us when we get sick. They help our bodies get better  but only if we take the right amount at the right time. That's why you only take them when I'm here to help you. Bad drugs are ones we should never take. They're also called 'hard drugs.' They are habit-forming, which means you get addicted, and it's very difficult to stop taking them even if you want to. People who are drug addicts stop eating and become very thin and sick.""""What's 'pot'?"" Marijuana is often the first illegal drug kids hear about. You can explain, "" 'Pot' is another word for marijuana. It's a drug people smoke like cigarettes, and just like cigarettes, it can damage your lungs. It can also affect your memory and make you forget things. You may hear about kids trying pot, but it's against the law to use it  for grown-ups and for children.""""How do drugs hurt you?"" Children this age think in very concrete images and are interested in how their bodies work. You can explain, ""Some drugs are ones that people smoke  they can hurt your lungs, where you breathe, just like cigarettes do. Some drugs come in the form of pills, and other drugs people take by sticking a needle in themselves, like a shot. The worst ones are called 'hard drugs,' and you can get addicted to them. Even drugs that aren't addictive can still hurt you because they have chemicals in them that damage your brain and make you do and think stupid or scary things or have terrible nightmares that don't go away. Eventually, bad drugs can kill you, because basically they're poison. They can make you stop breathing and die.""""What does 'addiction' mean?"" ""Addiction means you want something so much that you can't stop taking it. You might hear that drugs are 'habit-forming,' or that you can get 'hooked' on them  that's the same thing as being addicted. Addicts stop eating and don't take care of their bodies. They become very thin and sick, spend all their money on drugs, and eventually they may die from their addiction."""
Bronchitis in toddlers,https://www.babycenter.com/0_bronchitis-in-toddlers_1189989.bc,"What is bronchitis?Bronchitis is an infection or inflammation of the large air passages to the lungs. (These airways are called bronchi.) When your child has a cold, sore throat, flu, or sinus infection, the virus that caused it can spread to the bronchi. Once the germs take hold there, the airways become swollen, inflamed, and partly blocked with mucus.While viral infections are the most common culprits in children, bronchitis can also be caused by bacterial infections, allergies, and irritants such as cigarette smoke, fumes, and dust.Babies don't often get bronchitis, but they do commonly get bronchiolitis. This condition happens when the small air passages in a baby's lungs (bronchioles) get filled with mucus and become swollen. As with bronchitis, the instigator is usually a viral infection  in this case, most often respiratory syncytial virus (RSV).What are the symptoms?Your child may first have cold symptoms, like a sore throat, fatigue, a runny nose, chills, aches, and a slight fever (100 to 101 degrees Fahrenheit). He'll develop a cough, which often starts out dry and unproductive but winds up producing greenish or yellowish mucus. He may gag or vomit while coughing.Your child's chest may hurt, he may feel short of breath, and he may wheeze. If the bronchitis is severe, his fever may climb for a few days, and his cough may linger for several weeks as the bronchi heal.Some people  almost always adults who smoke or children who live with smokers  suffer from bronchitis symptoms for months at a time. This is called chronic bronchitis (as opposed to infectious or acute bronchitis), and it's one excellent reason to keep cigarettes out of your house.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.When should I call the doctor?Because the condition is almost always viral, there really isn't much your doctor can do for a child with bronchitis, but call him if you'd like a diagnosis or some reassurance. (Also call if your child is younger than 3 months and has symptoms of bronchitis  or any other illness.)To diagnose the condition, the doctor will listen to your child's lungs with a stethoscope. He may place a device on the end of your child's finger to measure the amount of oxygen in her blood. (This is called pulse oximetry.) He may also order a chest x-ray to make sure that your child doesn't have pneumonia.Do let the doctor know if your child's cough is getting worse after the first few days or so, or if she has a fever for more than a few days, or if her fever tops 103 degrees F. Also call if your child is wheezing in addition to coughing, or if she's coughing up blood.Read more about when to call the doctor.Of course, if your child is struggling to breathe, call 911. How is bronchitis treated?If your child's dealing with a bacterial infection, the doctor will prescribe antibiotics. But most of the time  because bronchitis is much more likely to be caused by a virus  antibiotics won't help. The condition should improve in a week to 10 days. Here are some tips for alleviating symptoms in the meantime:Give your child plenty of fluids  about eight to 10 glasses a day. This will both help relieve congestion and prevent dehydration.Run a cool-mist humidifier in your child's bedroom or play area during the day, especially if you live in a dry climate. Moistening the air may help him breathe easier. (Be sure to follow the manufacturer's directions for keeping it clean. When dirty, the device can spread germs through the air.)Try saline nasal drops to help with congestion. You can buy these over-the-counter. Simply put a drop or two in your child's nostril, then suction it out with a bulb syringe. (Once he's old enough, he can learn to blow it out himself.)Watch a video describing how to use a bulb syringe to clear mucus.Encourage your child to get plenty of rest. Cold weather, dust, and smoke can irritate a child's airways, so provide a clean, warm, smoke-free room for him to recuperate in.To make breathing easier, prop him up while he's resting and sleeping.To ease his fever and any discomfort, give him the appropriate dose of children's acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Never give your child aspirin, which is associated with Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal condition.Don't give your child a cough suppressant, either. As much as you hate to hear him hacking away, coughing up the mucus helps him heal. To soothe his throat and ease the cough a bit, you might try a little honey (either straight or in some warm tea). Don't give honey to your child if he's younger than 1, though. Honey can cause infant botulism, a rare form of food poisoning in babies.If your child has asthma, the doctor may prescribe a bronchodilator medication to widen his airways or a corticosteroid medication to ease inflammation.Is there any way to prevent bronchitis?Bronchitis isn't contagious, but the infections that often lead to the condition are. Frequent hand washing, good nutrition, adequate sleep, and avoiding others who are ill  all the things you routinely do to prevent illness  will help. Once your child is 6 months old, an annual flu shot will also provide some protection. And of course, no matter how healthy your child is, keep her away from secondhand smoke.Show sources Hide sources American Academy of Pediatrics. 2006.

Overweight and pregnant: How to manage weight gain during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_overweight-and-pregnant-how-to-manage-weight-gain-during-pre_1313887.bc,"If you started off your pregnancy carrying too much weight for your height, you're far from alone. More than half of pregnant women are overweight or obese.You're considered overweight if your pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) is between 25 and 29.9. (Your BMI reflects the relationship between your height and weight, and is an estimate of body fat.) You're considered obese if your BMI is 30 or greater.Not sure what your BMI is? Try thisBMI calculator.How much weight to gain if you're pregnant and overweight or obeseHow much to gain during pregnancy depends on your BMI:If your BMI is 25 to 29.9:It's recommended that you gain between 15 and 25 pounds by the end of your pregnancy, or approximately 2 to 3 pounds per month in your second and third trimesters.If your BMI is 30 or higher:You're advised to gain only 11 to 20 pounds during pregnancy.A study published in 2010 in the journalObstetrics & Gynecologyfound that pregnant women who gained more than the recommended weight were 50 percent more likely to developgestational diabetesthan moms-to-be whose weight stayed within recommended limits.For guidance, try ourpregnancy weight gain calculator and learn more aboutpregnancy weight gain.Can I diet to lose weight during pregnancy?Pregnancy is definitelynotthe time to go on a weight-loss diet: Restricting your food intake is potentially hazardous to you and your developing baby. But many plus-size women do lose weight during pregnancy without dieting.In the first trimester, it's common to lose weight as the result ofmorning sickness: The nausea can diminish your appetite, and the vomiting can cause you to miss out on calories. But even so, your baby will get all the necessary calories.Overweight women have an extra reserve of calories in stored fat, so as your baby grows, it's not harmful to maintain or even lose a little weight at first. What's not okay is losing weight because you're intentionally cutting calories (and, as a result, limiting nutrients).How to stay on track with weight gain if you're overweight or obeseExercising and eating healthy food can help you with your weight gain goals, and both can have a positive impact on your pregnancy, reducing your risk of pregnancy problems likegestational diabetesandpreeclampsia.

Pre-adoption medical assessment,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pre-adoption-medical-assessment_1374189.bc,"Reprinted from: Adoption plans for children are made for a variety of reasons, including poverty, single-parent households, previous abuse and neglect, maternal physical and mental illness, drug and alcohol abuse (both prior to and after birth), and legal regulations of a given country. These reasons become factors in a child's medical, developmental, and psychological future. That's why it's important to seek and understand a pre-adoption medical review. A review will address your concerns about the health of a child and help you give your child the best care.Although many families focus on the country of a child's birth in assessing health and development, this factor is not as important as the individual situation of a given child. Premature birth, poor prenatal nutrition, and living in an orphanage all play into the present and future health of a child. Families adopting outside the United States need to realize that children available for adoption overseas may have the same risk factors as children adopted from our own foster-care system.What you'll getMedical information that accompanies adoption referrals varies in depth, content, and accuracy.Domestic newborns:Parents about to adopt should receive information about prenatal care and diseases, and any blood testing the birthmother undergoes prior to delivery, including for hepatitis B, HIV, and syphilis.Older children:Whether adopted privately or fromfoster care, they should have medical records that include birth history, immunizations and previous health care, prenatal information, if available. You may also gain developmental information through a child's preventive health care records. For example, growth measurements (weight, length, and head circumference) should be plotted on standardNorth American growth charts. Seek any information about hospitalizations, surgeries, medications, and allergies, as well.International adoptions: Parents will find a variety of information available, depending on where they adopt from. Some countries provide only birth information (height, weight, general health, and so on), particularly for infant referrals. Other countries may offer more detailed information, including medical evaluations, developmental information, even birth-family history of medical disorders. Photos or videos may be available for children. Look for assessment of growth points, evaluating patterns of growth as well as the child's size. Be aware that medical terminology from some countries may be unfamiliar, even confusing, to many U.S. physicians.What to watch forHead size:Most physicians preparing pre-adoption referrals will pay careful attention to information about the size of a child's head. A small head (microcephaly) may suggest malnutrition, fetal alcohol exposure, or a birth defect, either genetic or resulting from the birth process.Growth rate:Understand that children who have lived in institutional care are at increased risk for growth delay. Adoption physicians agree that a child will typically lose one month of growth for every three months in an orphanage. With mild malnutrition, the child may be smaller than his peers, but his head size should be normal.Fetal Alcohol Syndrome:Photos and/or videos of all children (not just those from Russia and Eastern Europe) should be assessed for possible Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Signs of this disorder include growth delay, developmental delay, and mental health problems. Whenever possible (when videos are available, for example), language should be assessed, particularly to rule out hearing disorders. A child should also be assessed for unusual stiffness (increase in muscle tone) and/or asymmetry in the way she uses her body.Other diagnoses:Specific medical diagnoses, such as cleft lip and palate, heart defects, and limb abnormalities, should be identified with a review of pertinent medical records. The availability and accuracy of such records varies depending upon the child's birth country. Sometimes additional information can be requested, to give more data about an identified special need, but this is not always available.Developmental milestones:Development should be assessed closely, using written information, as well as pictures and videos. Developmental milestones should coincide with a child's growth, as recorded on a growth chart. For example, a 1-year-old child the size of a 9-month-old should be at the 9-month level developmentally. Extreme delays may indicate long-term challenges.Social skills:Particular attention should be paid to a child's social interactions and language skills, especially if a video is available. A video can reflect only moments in a child's life, but it may demonstrate how a child responds to familiar adults and children. Behaviors such as seeking affection, responding to verbal commands, and looking for solace when upset are important in assessing how a child may attach to a new family.Putting it togetherProspective adoptive parents often seek out a physician with experience in adoption and foster-care medicine who will review medical-referral information to determine what other (if any) information is needed to make an informed decision. Many such physicians are members of theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics Council on Foster Care, Adoption, and Kinship Care and are available for consultation before you travel.Even with the most complete medical referral, there are still uncertainties ahead. While an objective review of the health information will help you decide whether you are able to provide a good home for a child, adoption is ultimately a leap of faith. Children who come with a past that may influence their future will do best in a loving home prepared to meet their challenges.Find out more:Post-adoption check-upsDevelopmental milestones in babies and toddlersDownloadable worksheets to help you budget for and navigate the adoption processDeborah Borchers, M.D., is a founding member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Adoption and Foster Care, and the mother of three children adopted internationally.Copyright  2014 Building Your Family"
Healthy foods on the go,https://www.babycenter.com/0_healthy-foods-on-the-go_1436236.bc,"Children get their daily nutrition from snacks as well as meals, which is why it's a good idea to have healthy choices with you when you're on the go. Consider these nutritious foods you can grab and go:Fresh fruitPeel fruit and remove any seeds or pits, then cut into pieces small enough for your child to eat safely. Mandarin oranges are one of our favorite good-for-kids foods.VeggiesDo not serve vegetables like carrots, broccoli, or green beans, which can be choking hazards, raw. Instead, shred or cut them into pieces small enough for your child to eat safely, and cook. Try blanching  steam the veggies until tender, then submerge them in cold water to stop the cooking. Drain well and serve with yogurt dip or hummus.Mini muffinsBake carrot, fruit, or zucchini mini muffins. Adding a few tablespoons of wheat germ or a handful of oats to any batter increases the fiber content. Preschoolers especially like tiny muffins.Diced cheeseCut cheese into pieces small enough for your child to eat safely.Mini sandwichesMake a sandwich on a whole-wheat dinner roll. Spread egg salad made with low-fat mayo and sprinkled with diced avocado or tomato. Alternatively, try mini pitas with turkey and avocado. Cut sandwiches into pieces small enough for your child to eat safely.WrapsFor toddlers and older children, spread a little nut butter on a small whole-wheat tortilla or flatbread and sprinkle diced strawberries on top, then roll and slice into pieces small enough for your child to eat safely. Other tasty wrap combos: hummus and shredded carrots; a layer of pureed mango or papaya with sliced avocado; or thinly spread cream cheese with chopped cucumbers.ApplesaucePick different flavors and blends for a satisfying low-fat source of fiber and vitamin C that tastes pleasingly sweet. Or look for single-serve cups of fruit. Check the label to be sure it's packed in juice, without added sugar.Eating safely on the goTo prevent choking, always have your child stop and sit down to eat where she can focus on eating and you can keep an eye on her, and cut food into pieces small enough for your child to eat safely. Never eat while moving around.Pack perishable foods like dips, yogurt, meat, or cheese in a mini cooler. (This is especially important if you're going to be gone longer than two hours.)Learn more about food safety guidelines for babies and food safety guidelines for toddlers and older children.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

The family meal,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-family-meal_1436248.bc,"Between parents' and children's busy schedules, sitting down together for an evening meal can be a challenge, but there are plenty of good reasons not to let this tradition disappear from your home.Studies show children in families who eat together regularly tend to eat more fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Other studies suggest that kids who sit down to regular family meals are less likely to be overweight or have eating disorders. It's the stability, communication, and time spent together that make the ritual of regular meals a habit worth ingraining in your family while your children are young.Here are some ways to make this goal a pleasure, not a chore.Pick a meal any meal. It doesn't have to be dinner. If you have time in the morning to have breakfast together, make that your group meal. Be sure you have enough time, though: The meal shouldn't be rushed or stressful.If family meals aren't a habit for you now, consider starting with two or three group meals a week. Try to work up to five to seven meals a week  the number one study indicated may promote health benefits for teens.Take advantage of snacks. Avoid serving two distinct meals at different times, one for the kids and one for the grown-ups.If your child is starving at 5 p.m. but everybody won't be together until 7 p.m., consider giving her a protein snack in the late afternoon to tide her over. Then eat together later.Plan menus ahead. Lose the what-to-cook worries by thinking through the week's meals. Choose which days to cook and which days to pull something from the freezer. Shop for menu items once a week to save time and have everything you need on hand.The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics points out that family mealtime is the perfect opportunity to make sure the whole family gets enough of the four ""gap"" nutrients adults and kids often lack:Potassium, found in vegetables including potatoes, spinach, broccoli, and tomatoes, and in such fruits as oranges and bananas. Dairy products, seafood, and beans are other good sources.Fiber, found in beans, peas, potatoes, greens, oranges, mangoes, whole grains, and nuts.Calcium, found in dairy products and foods that have been fortified with the mineral.Vitamin D, found in fortified foods, fish, and egg yolks.In some urban areas, families may find it convenient to order groceries online through such resources as Safeway and Peapod. Check online to see if your local grocery store has a delivery service. Though you may still want to hit the stores to choose fresh produce.Stock up. Keeping your pantry well stocked helps make sure you have everything you need to whip up a quick meal. This is also a good fallback strategy for ""last resort"" days when plans change and you need to make something nutritious  fast.Buy a variety of meat and fish in bulk, and store them in meal-size packages in the freezer. (See Freezer Facts.) Don't overlook some quick-prep foods, such as microwaveable brown rice and mashed potatoes, frozen tortellini, pancake mix, and prewashed salads.Prep ahead. If you tend to have more time in the morning, wash and trim the vegetables you plan to cook later. Cut up broccoli or carrots and put them in the fridge in a covered pot of water.Consider posting the day's menu on the refrigerator. Writing it down reminds you what you need to do in the morning and lets you or other family members know what needs to be done later in the day.Think fast. Many nutritious meals can be microwaved, stir-fried, or broiled  all speedy ways to cook. If you're using a cookbook, look for recipes where the prep and cook time combined are less than an hour. Save more elaborate meals for weekends.Plan to have leftovers. Make double batches of such foods as soups, stews, and casseroles, so you can just heat and eat on some days. Or make something that does double duty. For example, cook extra potatoes and set up a baked-potato bar (with veggies and cheese) one evening for dinner and then use the leftovers for a potato salad the next day.Buy partially prepared foods. Save prep time by buying grated or cubed cheese, prewashed spinach, or skinned and boned chicken breasts, for example. These will undoubtedly cost more, so balance cost with time. Sometimes it's worth paying a bit more when you really need to save time.Speed things up with takeout. Most supermarkets sell such ready-to-eat items as hot rotisserie chicken, pasta salads, and sandwiches. Some stores also have an extended salad bar that features hot soups and other prepared meals.Develop family favorites. You don't need to reinvent the wheel with each meal. Put together a short list of quick, reliable meals. Maybe in your house it's fish every Monday and pizza every Friday.Mix up meals. Serve breakfast or lunch for dinner. Eggs, pancakes, waffles, grilled cheese sandwiches, soup  even a bowl of cereal with sliced fruit  can all be the basis of quick, serviceable dinners.Change the venue. Plan a picnic after soccer practice instead of heading for the drive-thru if that works best on some days. Or eat off paper plates on the front porch.Keep it light. Don't use mealtimes for lectures or topics that could lead to arguments. The point is to enjoy being together.Turn off the TV. It's a good way to keep the focus on each other!"

Your 4-month-old's development: Week 2,https://www.babycenter.com/0_your-4-month-olds-development-week-2_1477219.bc,"Eating less frequentlyYour baby has a bigger tummy now, so she won't need to fill up as often. Four or five times a day will often do it, in fact, unless she's exclusively breastfed, in which case she'll still want to eat six to eight times a day.Your baby may have doubled her birth weight by now, and she's still gaining, of course, despite her more mature eating schedule. (The content of your breast milk has also changed, with more fat and minerals to match your baby's nutritional needs.)Don't expect maturity in her eating habits though: Your baby is easily distracted now, and feedings can become frustrating as she stops to watch a sibling or respond to an outside noise. You might try to minimize distractions by feeding her in a quiet, dimmed room.Playing soloBy now, your baby can play with her hands and feet for a few minutes at a time. She's quite fond of doing one action over and over again until she's sure of the result. Then, she'll switch things up just a bit to see if the result is different.Suddenly you realize it's strangely quiet in the bedroom and look in, only to discover that your baby, who so far has needed your attention for most of every waking moment, is amusing herself in her crib. You might be able to start reading the paper again  well, maybe just the headlines.Remember, your baby is an individualAll babies are unique and meet milestones at their own pace. Developmental guidelines simply show what your baby has the potential to accomplish  if not right now, then soon. If your baby was premature, keep in mind that kids born early usually need a bit more time to meet their milestones. If you have any questions at all about your baby's development, ask your healthcare provider.Look backLook aheadShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2009. Emotional and social development: 4 to 7 months.

Weaning your toddler,https://www.babycenter.com/0_weaning-your-toddler_1736063.bc,"What does it mean to have weaned a child?When your child stops nursing and gets all his nutrition from sources other than the breast, he's considered weaned. Although children are also weaned from the bottle, the term most often refers to when a child stops breastfeeding.Weaning, when it's the mother's idea, usually requires a lot of patience and can take time, depending on your child's age and how well and how quickly he adjusts. The experience is different for everyone.Weaning is a long goodbye  emotional, sometimes painful, and freeing at the same time. But weaning needn't signal an end to the intimacy you and your child have established through breastfeeding. It just means you have to replace breastfeeding with other nourishment and nurturing activities. If you've often nursed your child for comfort, find other ways to make him feel better. Read a book or sing a song together, or play outside instead.When should I start weaning?You're the best judge of when it's time to wean, and you don't have to set a deadline unless you and your child are ready to do so. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that mothers breastfeed their children for at least a year. Despite what friends, relatives, or even strangers may say, there's no right or wrong time to wean. If you feel it's the right time, then it is.How do I wean?Proceed slowly, regardless of the age of your child. Experts advise that you not abruptly withhold your breast, which can be traumatic. A weekend away from your toddler with your partner, for example, is not a good way to end the breastfeeding relationship. Try these methods instead:Skip a feeding. Skip a feeding and see what happens. Offer a cup or bottle of milk instead. As a substitute you can use your own pumped milk, formula, or cow's milk. If you reduce feedings one at a time over a period of weeks your child will have time to adjust to the changes. Your milk supply will also diminish, without leaving your breasts engorged or giving you mastitis, a breast infection.Shorten nursing time. Start by cutting the length of time your child is actually on the breast. If he usually nurses for five minutes, try three. Follow the feeding with a healthy snack like unsweetened applesauce or a cup of milk or formula. Bedtime feedings may be harder to curb  they're usually the last to go.Postpone and distract. Try postponing feedings if you're only nursing a couple of times a day. This method works well if you have an older child you can reason with. If your child asks for the breast, say you'll feed him later and distract him. Instead of nursing in the early evening, you could tell him to wait until bedtime.What to do when weaning becomes a struggleIf you've tried everything to wean your child and nothing is working, maybe the time isn't right. Have you recently gone back to work? Your child may still be adjusting to this new development. Has your child been sick? Often children who aren't feeling well will want to nurse more often  in fact, breastfeeding may be in a sick child's best interest.Has your household gone through a major life change, such as a move or a divorce? Events such as these will also make weaning more difficult. Even going through a new developmental stage can make it hard to wean. Try again in another month. Sooner or later, it'll happen."
Nanny care: Licensing and training programs,https://www.babycenter.com/0_nanny-care-licensing-and-training-programs_6043.bc,"Are nannies licensed?No, because there is no government licensing process for nannies like there is for daycare centers. But you can look for other signs that a nanny candidate takes her job seriously.Some nannies attend schools with classes on first aid and CPR, child development, and nutrition. Schools may offer certification to nannies who have completed a specified training program, such as the 3-month residential program offered by the <http://www.nanny-governess.com>English Nanny & Governess School<>, but this is different than actual licensing.Some nannies have a degree in early childhood education, a helpful qualification but no substitute for experience in caring for children. (For more information, see our articles on finding a good nanny and signs of a good nanny).Since your nanny will be responsible for the day-to-day safety of your child, it's important to look for a nanny who has knowledge of CPR and first aid.What about nanny agencies?You may hear the term ""licensed"" applied to nanny agencies, however. A nanny agency is an employment service that may be licensed by the state department of labor. Nanny agencies recruit, screen, and interview those who want to become nannies, accepting only qualified applicants.A good nanny agency also verifies references and conducts background checks, and may even require nannies to have a physical and a TB test. Some agencies are staffed with licensed employment counselors, and they may be members of larger organizations, such as the International Nanny Association (INA).So if you hire a nanny who is referred to you by a respected nanny agency even though the nanny isn't licensed, you still can be sure she meets a certain standard of qualification.The INA offers a ""Nanny Credential Exam,"" a course of study and a test that sets a standard for nannies to prove themselves as professionals. To learn more, visit the INA's website."
Signs of a bad preschool,https://www.babycenter.com/0_signs-of-a-bad-preschool_6055.bc,"Starting preschool is a momentous event for your child. It's that first big step away from babyhood and toward childhood. Be particular when choosing a preschool.Start your search at least several months before you want to send your child: In some areas, families need to get on wait lists years ahead of time to get a spot at a top preschool.As you search, watch for the warning signs listed below. If you see any at a school you're considering, keep looking.A so-so rating from parentsDon't hesitate to judge a preschool based on what you've heard from other parents. In this situation, word of mouth can be a source of important information.Of course, try not to form a definite opinion about a school until you see it for yourself  disgruntled parents may simply have had a negative experience with the school or a personality conflict with the preschool director. Trust your own first impressions more than anyone else's. After you visit, if you'd be even the slightest bit reluctant to leave your child there, you should probably keep looking for another school.Bottom line: If you share any negative opinions about a school, move on.Loose rulesRules and regulations are important for any institution. Schools without clearly established guidelines for everything from operating hours to how to handle emergencies are likely to have other organizational problems as well.Similarly, preschools with a lax sick-child policy. should be crossed off your list. If children (and staff) who come down with a fever or the flu don't have to stay home for at least 24 hours, your child is much more likely to catch every little illness that comes along.The preschool should require staff and children to have current immunizations and get regular checkups. This policy is a good indication of how seriously they take health and cleanliness concerns.A preschool that balks at having parents drop by unannounced could be hiding something. If you run into a closed-door policy, move on.Bottom line: If a school has loose rules and is poorly organized, it's not right for you.A questionable curriculumSkip preschools that either have no daily program or offer one that is static and unchallenging. Children need variety, change, and a chance to grow. If the school doesn't offer organized, age-appropriate activities that change regularly, or if television and videos are a big part of the day's agenda, keep looking.A teacher who doesn't spend time reading to kids, encouraging creative play, and varying activities isn't meeting your child's development needs. But don't evaluate a school based solely on how many numbers and letters your child is learning  preschoolers aren't ready for a rigorous academic program.It's also a bad sign if the school's structure seems rigid, with an inflexible schedule that doesn't leave room for children to explore at their own pace. The best programs encourage development naturally, so children may look like they're simply playing (that's okay).The school gets another black mark if its selection of age-appropriate toys is lacking. Having enough of the right toys not only encourages your child's development by stimulating creative, imaginative play, but it may also help prevent kids from getting into too many tussles over who gets to play with what and when.See our list of suggested preschool toys by age group.Bottom line: Your child needs a wide range of age-appropriate toys and activities to encourage development. If the school doesn't offer them, keep looking. An underqualified staffJust as at a daycare center, preschool teachers should have at least two years of college and a background in early childhood development as well as CPR and other emergency training. They should also be responsible, enthusiastic, and well prepared. Make sure they share your philosophy on care issues such as sleep, discipline, and and nutrition.Watch how staff members interact with their students: If they're inattentive, impatient, or distracted, your child deserves better teachers.It's also important to make sure the school has enough teachers. According to the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC), a preschool should have no more than 20 children in a group with one teacher for every ten children  or at least two teachers, even in much smaller groups. Big groups, no matter how many teachers they have, discourage individual attention and make it harder for children to interact well with each other.Undercompensated staffA poorly compensated staff leads to high turnover. Of course, even the best preschools can sometimes find it hard to hire  and keep  dedicated employees.Most preschool teachers are paid very little (usually just above minimum wage), and the demands of keeping up with a group of 3- and 4-year-olds every day can be wearying. But preschools that don't offer paid vacation and health insurance are even less likely to be able to retain staff long-term.Bottom line: If teachers seem undertrained and overworked, or if turnover is high, the preschool isn't for you.Dirty, unsafe facilitiesA good preschool is clean and safe. It has to be to meet licensing requirements in most states.Nevertheless, make sure the floors, walls, and kitchen area are clean. Also check that food preparation areas are far away from the bathroom, trash cans aren't overflowing, and the building is adequately heated, lit, and ventilated.Make sure the preschool follows the basic rules of safety, too. Strangers shouldn't be able to just walk in off the street  and children shouldn't be able to wander out.Toys and play equipment should be in good condition and upstairs windows (if any) should have stops or bars. Medication and all other hazardous substances should be stored out of reach, and the outdoor play area should be level and secure.Working smoke detectors should be in place, radiators and heaters should be covered or otherwise protected, and a first-aid kit and fire extinguisher should be close at hand.Bottom line: If the preschool seems dingy, cramped, or dangerous, move on.An expired licenseAsk to see a preschool's license and credentials, then call your local social services department to double check that everything is current. To be licensed, preschools must meet state licensing regulations for health and safety.Of course a license doesn't guarantee quality care, but most states require certain credentials, and preschools that don't have them aren't fulfilling the most basic requirements.Try to find a facility that has passed the stringent accreditation process required by NAEYC, a benchmark of quality childcare, by searching the organization's online database.Bottom line: A license isn't everything, but if a preschool doesn't have one, pass.Learn the signs of a good preschool.Read more about finding a great preschool.Show sources Hide sources AACAP.

Brain development: Parietal lobe,https://www.babycenter.com/0_brain-development-parietal-lobe_6612.bc,"The parietal lobe of the brain, located near the crown of the head, controls taste, touch, the ability to recognize objects, hand-eye coordination, and some visual recognition (the ability to understand what you're looking at).This area of the brain benefits greatly from environmental stimulation. As you give your baby new objects to play with and textures to touch and enjoy, you are directly stimulating development in the parietal lobe.Although newborns aren't usually exposed to different foods (the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breast milk or formula be her only nutrition for the first six months), studies show that babies have a preference for sweet foods from day one. They also pucker their mouths just like adults when tasting sour flavors.To learn more about the parietal lobe skills your baby is developing, see the following articles:Milestone: GraspingMilestone: SightMilestone: UnderstandingSee an image of the brain and learn more about brain development."
Sleep problem: Waking up hungry,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sleep-problem-waking-up-hungry_7539.bc,"Why it happensThese days, no matter how much or how often you eat, you may still feel ravenous night and day. That's not surprising. After all, the tiny person growing inside you has caloric needs of his own.That doesn't give you license to eat anything and everything  after all, you're eating for yourself and a tiny baby, not another adult  but it does help explain why you're waking up hungry in the middle of the night.Surprisingly, you need only 300 or so extra calories a day when you're pregnant, and even fewer during your first trimester. Still, your racing metabolism may leave your stomach growling or nauseated.What you can do about itNever go to bed hungry. If you're hungry, so is your baby. Keep your fridge and cupboards stocked with quick, healthy snacks such as cottage cheese, boiled eggs, and fresh fruits and vegetables.Try to eat things in as close to their natural state as possible: Choose whole-grain bread or brown rice over more processed white bread or white rice, and fresh fruit over canned fruit in sugary syrup. Go light on fats and sweets.If you're craving a midnight snack, choose something that packs a nutritional punch as well as satisfying your hunger pangs: a bowl of cereal with milk, toast with peanut butter, or a few crackers with cheese.Remember to drink liquids, too, to stay hydrated. (If you find yourself making frequent trips to the bathroom in the night, you may want to try to get more liquids early in the day and fewer right before bed, though.)At the same time, be careful not to overeat if you're suffering from indigestion or heartburn, or you'll be awake for a problem that's more difficult to remedy!"
Feedings during the night: 2 to 3 years,https://www.babycenter.com/0_feedings-during-the-night-2-to-3-years_7710.bc,"To feed or not to feed  that is the question in the middle of the night. All the experts agree that you should feed your baby whenever he wakes at night those first few months, but once he's 6 months old, do your best to avoid that midnight snack. The goal is to separate eating from going to sleep so that if he does wake up at night he doesn't depend on a bottle or your breast to get back to sleep.Mindell's viewYour toddler should be getting enough nutrition during the day that he doesn't need to eat at night. You will just make sleep problems more likely if you continue to feed him at bedtime. Read more about Mindell.Ferber's viewIf you're still nursing your child to sleep at this age or putting him to bed with a bottle, it's very likely he's learned to associate that with falling asleep  and much less likely that he's actually hungry. It's time to eliminate nighttime feedings. Over the course of about a week, gradually reduce the number of ounces your child is drinking at each feeding and increase the amount of time before you nurse him or give him another bottle until he's no longer eating during the night. Read more about Ferber.The AAP's viewHelp your child brush her teeth before bed, and don't let her eat after that (a bedside drink of water is okay, though). If you haven't already switched from giving her milk when she wakes up at night, now's the time. Either dilute it or change it to water, and gradually stop giving her anything. Read more about the AAP.Brazelton's viewThis is not an issue you need to worry about with toddlers  they don't need to eat during the night. Read more about Brazelton.Sear's viewAt this age your child probably doesn't need regular feedings at night anymore. Some children may still need to suck to soothe themselves to sleep; if this is the case, a bottle of water is all right. Older children can also have healthy bedtime snacks such as a glass of warm milk, cheese and crackers, a bowl of cereal with fruit, or yogurt with fruit. Avoid feeding your child caffeine and junk food, which can interfere with her sleep patterns. Read more about Sears.Parent Poll: Which expert's sleep advice have you found the most helpful?"
Breastfeeding an adopted baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-an-adopted-baby_8482.bc,"What do I need to know?You may be surprised to learn that you don't have to give birth to nurse a baby  you can breastfeed an adopted baby. But only half of all adopting mothers who attempt to breastfeed will make any milk at all and few will produce enough to fully satisfy their babies.It's the suckling of a child that triggers milk production, not an automatic physiological reaction that begins during pregnancy. Hormones drive the production of breast milk. Prolactin, a hormone created by the pituitary gland, makes breast milk, and if you stimulate the breast enough to increase prolactin levels, you will get milk.An increase in the hormones estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy do help prepare a woman's body for breastfeeding by enlarging the ducts and alveoli  so it's more difficult to start the milk flowing in mothers who haven't delivered a child.Learn more about how your body makes breast milk.What challenges could I face?Inducing lactation isn't complicated, but it does take time: Buy or rent a hospital-grade breast pump, and use it often. But don't expect to lactate overnight. It can take a month or more of regular pumping to trigger milk production (start slow but build up to eight to ten times a day). Timing this with your baby's arrival can be tricky, since few adoptive parents get much advance notice.While adoptive moms can nurse, they usually can't produce as much milk as women who go through pregnancy (that's where the hormones come in).How can I solve these problems?Think of breastfeeding as an opportunity to teach your new baby who her mommy is, and where she can turn for comfort and love. But don't expect to be your baby's sole source of nutrition.""The goal for adoptive mothers who are nursing isn't producing a certain amount of milk  it's bonding with the child,"" says Susan Condon, an international board-certified lactation consultant. ""Most women say they aren't concerned with the volume of milk that they produce. They just want the opportunity to be close to their new baby.""You probably won't be able to coax a full supply of milk from your breasts, so you'll need to supplement. But that doesn't mean you have to use bottles.Condon recommends the Medela Supplemental Nursing System (SNS), which allows you to feed formula to your baby formula through a pair of thin tubes you attach to your areola with surgical tape. Your baby nurses normally and gets a mix of formula and whatever breast milk you're producing. If you use this method, plan on supplementing with premixed or concentrated formula, not the the powdered version, which might have trouble going through the tubing if it's not mixed thoroughly.Another popular system is the Lact-Aid Nursing Trainer. It works like the Medela system but has soft, collapsible plastic bags instead of plastic bottles to hold the formula, making it possible to nurse your baby more discreetly. These supplementers have two functions: They ensure that your baby is getting enough food and they encourage nipple sucking, which triggers more breast milk production.It might be possible to use donor breast milk instead of formula. Because the demand for donated breast milk is higher than the supply, your baby may have to meet certain criteria. Talk with your baby's doctor to see whether you qualify.Where can I get more help?La Leche League International is one of the best resources for any nursing mother. La Leche can provide more information on this subject, and possibly connect you with other adoptive mothers in your area who are nursing. The group also has a few pamphlets about inducing lactation.Condon recommends the book Breastfeeding the Adopted Baby, by Debra Peterson. ""I bet a lot of adoptive moms have no idea this is something they can do,"" she says. ""If women knew they had the choice, I think a lot of them would try nursing."""
How much formula your baby needs,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-much-formula-your-baby-needs_9136.bc,"It can be tricky to figure out how much formula to give your baby. Is he getting too much or too little? How much is enough? The answers depend mostly on how much your baby weighs and how he's growing.How much formula to feed your baby: Where to startIn general, babies eat when they're hungry and stop when they're full. But formula-fed babies tend to be heavier than breastfed babies, appetites vary among babies, and each baby's nutritional needs change from day to day and month to month.That may sound complicated, but if you follow the basic guidelines below and check in regularly withyour baby's doctor, your baby will likely be on track.Watch the video: See real parents at a doctor's appointment with their newborn, getting advice about how to tell whether their baby is getting the right amount of formula. Signs your formula-fed baby is eating the right amountSometimes babies eat too much formula, and sometimes not enough. Learn what to watch for.Our guidelines are for babies who are exclusively formula fed for the first four to six months, and then fed a combination of formula and solids up to age 1.Don't give your baby more than 32 ounces of formula in a day, and once he starts eating solids, you'll probably need to cut back on the amount of formula you feed him. Your baby's doctor can tell you where your baby falls on thegrowth chartsand help make sure he's growing steadily and getting a healthy amount of formula.Note: If your baby is getting a combination ofbreast milkand formula, talk to his doctor for more detailed advice.How much formula by babys weightIn the first four to six months when your baby isn'teating any solids, here's a simple rule of thumb: Offer 2.5 ounces of formula per pound of body weight each day.For example, if your baby weighs 6 pounds, you'll give her about 15 ounces of formula in a 24-hour period. If she weighs 10 pounds, you'll give her about 25 ounces in a 24-hour period.These numbers are not rigid rules. They give you an overall average for what your baby is likely to require. His daily feedings will vary according to his individual needs  in other words, he may want a bit more on some days and a bit less on others.Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.How much formula by signs of hungerLearning to read your baby's hunger cues will help you know when and how much formula to feed your baby.Your new baby:If your newborn is hungry, she'll eventually cry. But crying is a late sign of hunger. Earlier signs to watch for include smacking her lips or sucking, rooting (turning her head toward your hand when you stroke her cheek), and putting her hands to her mouth.Changing appetites:Your baby may be hungrier than usual during growth spurts. These typically occur ten to 14 days after birth and at age 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. And your baby may be less hungry than usual if she's not feeling well.Wanting more:You'll know that your baby wants more when she finishes the feeding quickly and looks around for more. If she seems hungry after her first bottle, try preparing just an ounce or two more at a time. If you make a larger amount, she may not finish it andyou'll have to throw it out.Getting too much in a feeding:Vomiting after a feeding may be a sign that your baby had too much. (Spitting up is normal, vomiting isn't. Find outhow to tell the difference.) Tummy pain after a feeding can also be a sign of overfeeding. If your baby draws up his legs or his tummy seems tense, he may be in pain.(See six other possible reasons forstomach pain in babies.)It's not always hunger:Resist the urge to respond to your baby's every whimper with a bottle. Consider the possibility  especially if you've recently fed her  that she's crying because her diaper is wet, she's cold or hot, she needs to be burped, or she simply wants to be close to you. For more help, see12 reasons babies cry and how to soothe them.How much formula by babys ageIn the first week, formula-feed your newborn on demand. After that, it's important not to overfeed your baby so he'll stay at a healthy weight.Most new babies want to eat every few hours. Start with 1.5 to 2 ounces at each feeding for the first week, and work up to 2 to 3 ounces every three to four hours.As your baby gets older  and his tummy gets bigger  he'll drink fewer bottles a day with more formula in each. By about 1 month, for example, he may be down to five or six bottles of 4 ounces every 24 hours. And by 6 months, he'll typically be down to four or five bottles of 6 to 8 ounces per day.He's likely to maintain that four-to-five-bottle pace until his first birthday, when he can transition to whole cow's milkin a bottle orsippy cup, along withthree solid meals and two snacks between mealsper day.Signs that your baby's getting the right amount of formulaThese are signs that your baby's getting all the formula she needs:Steady weight gain. She continues to gain weight after her first two weeks and maintains the same pattern of growth during her first year. (Most babies lose up to 10 percent of their birth weight and then regain it by the time they're about 2 weeks old.)Happy baby. She seems relaxed and satisfied after a feeding.Wet diapers. She wets five to six diapers a day if you're using disposable diapers, or six to eight if you're using cloth diapers. (Disposables hold more liquid.)Worries that your baby's getting too much or too little formulaIf you're worried that your baby is getting too little or too much formula, talk with his doctor. The doctor can check your baby's weight and growth, tell you whether his intake is appropriate for his size and age, and advise you about any adjustments you may need to make.Solutions to formula feeding problemsFor answers to other formula feeding questions, visit ourFormula Feeding Problem Solver.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012.

Feeding problems: Food jags,https://www.babycenter.com/0_feeding-problems-food-jags_9196.bc,"The problemIt's not uncommon for young children to go through a period of days, even weeks, when they'll eat only one or two foods. Part of the reason is that kids gravitate toward familiar foods. But demanding macaroni and cheese for breakfast, lunch, and dinner is also a way for them to assert their independence, says Olivia Bennett Wood, associate professor of foods and nutrition at Purdue University in Indiana.What you can do""The less you make of it the better,"" says Wood. No child is going to become malnourished from eating macaroni and cheese for a week. In the meantime, be patient and keep offering a variety of healthy foods without pressuring your child to eat.If your child is old enough, here are additional strategies for getting her excited about eating a more varied diet:Take her to the supermarket with you and allow her to select two fruits, two vegetables, one snack, a box of cereal, and so on. At home, have her help you prepare foods.A 3-year-old can assist with mixing batter, cleaning fruits and vegetables, and tearing up lettuce leaves. Chances are she'll be proud of her accomplishment and more likely to want to eat the finished product.Vitamins are definitely not a substitute for nutritious food. But depending on how long the food jag goes on and how limited your child's diet is in the long run, it may make sense to give her a daily multivitamin.Talk to the doctor about it first, and if vitamins are recommended, ask which formulation is appropriate for your child's age."
Feeding problems: Only eats junk food,https://www.babycenter.com/0_feeding-problems-only-eats-junk-food_9198.bc,"The problemFoods that are nutritional zeroes are typically high in calories, sugar, or fat, making them pretty easy to spot. Topping the list of kids' junk food favorites: soda, candy, and chips. What you can doAs a parent, you can't control what your child eats at daycare or school or other people's homes, but you can keep junk food out of your house.If your child is constantly reaching for junk food, you need to keep healthier foods within his reach. Kids love finger foods and they love to nibble, says Melvin Heyman, co-author of Feeding Your Child for Lifelong Health.Serve melon cubes with yogurt dip or red pepper and zucchini strips with hummus. Make fruit smoothies with frozen or fresh blueberries, strawberries, bananas, yogurt, milk, or ice cream.Forbidding a food can make matters worse, says Janis Jibrin, R.D. ""You can't expect a child to accept fruit when she really wants a piece of chocolate,"" she says. She suggests doling out the treats in small quantities.Still, if the ""treats"" are not in the house, your child won't beg for them and you won't be tempted to let your child have some.If your child is really hooked on the bad stuff, try weaning him off of it slowly by offering similar but healthier substitutions. For instance, instead of dishing up ice cream every night, offer him low-fat ice cream, frozen yogurt, or sorbet. Replace salty, high-fat chips with pretzels or baked tortilla chips.Eventually your child will come to expect the healthier alternatives."
Feeding problems: Bad table manners,https://www.babycenter.com/0_feeding-problems-bad-table-manners_9202.bc,"The problemTeaching your child table manners can begin as soon as he starts eating solid food. So whether he's still in a highchair or has graduated to a big boy seat at the family dinner table, it's never too early to instill good habits.For example, although mealtime is a social experience, teaching your child not to talk when he has food in his mouth is not only good manners, but it can also prevent gagging or choking.What you can doTime it right. For starters, make sure your child is not too tired to eat, says Olivia Bennett Wood, associate professor of foods and nutrition at Purdue University. And make sure he's hungry. No snacking for at least an hour before the meal.Be patient. Mealtimes are a messy affair as toddlers explore new foods and work on mastering self-feeding skills. By 15 months, most children should be able to control a spoon fairly well, but some children still make a mess at mealtime long past their second birthday.Plan your course of action. Different behaviors call for different responses. For example, if your child has taken to flinging food or banging his spoon, the best reaction is no reaction. Making him the focus of attention even when he's behaving at the table may encourage him to show off, too. But once a child realizes his behavior isn't gaining him any attention  positive or negative  he'll often stop.Sometimes more drastic measures are necessary. A child learns that certain behavior  such as flinging food or arguing with a sibling  is unacceptable when he realizes it's not tolerated at the table. Putting your child in a time-out until he feels ready to rejoin the family teaches him that he's expected to act a certain way while eating.Children look to their parents for cues about how to behave at the table, so above all model the behavior that you want your child to imitate. And do pay attention to what he does right and praise him when he behaves well at the table.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012a. Feeding and nutrition: Your one-year-old.

Feeding problems: Refusing to eat,https://www.babycenter.com/0_feeding-problems-refusing-to-eat_9203.bc,"The problemOne of the first skills your toddler masters is feeding herself. Though she can't control much in her life right now, she can definitely control what she puts in her mouth.So it's no surprise when she's very opinionated about what she will  and won't  eat. She may eat only one or two preferred foods for weeks, then suddenly change her mind and want something completely different. Don't worry  this is typical toddler behavior.What you can doYour child needs some encouragement and structure from you when it comes to mealtimes (such as regular meals and healthy choices), but not much more. William Sears, noted pediatrician and author of 23 books on childcare, says whether and how much your child eats should ultimately be up to her. ""Your child may eat well one day and eat practically nothing the next,"" says Dr. Sears, who co-authored The Family Nutrition Book with his wife, Martha.Rather than get hung up on the fact that your child has refused everything you put in front of her today, consider what she's eaten over the course of one week. Parents are often surprised to find that their child's food intake balances out. Something must be fueling all that energy!Rest assured: As long as your child is growing and gaining weight accordingly, you can be confident that your toddler is getting enough to eat. If you're concerned, ask your child's doctor to go over your child's growth chart. You may be relieved to find out you dont have anything to worry about!Here are a few tips to help get through those bumpy patches:Offer a variety of healthy food choices and let your toddler feed herself. This way she gets to exercise a little independence.Don't threaten her or bargain with her. ""One more bite and you get a cookie,"" or, ""No story time if you don't eat your peas,"" makes mealtime into a power struggle. If you want to raise a healthy eater, keep mealtimes positive, and don't use sweets as a reward.Have meals as a family whenever possible. When your toddler sees you or her siblings eating healthy food, she's more likely to want to follow along.Don't take something off the menu if she doesn't like it. Kids are slow to accept new tastes and textures, so if she spits out green beans the first time, try making them again the following week. She may surprise you and decide they're her new favorite food. (Though you may have to offer a new food many times before she's willing to make it a regular part of her diet.)Don't forget to consider how much she drinks in the food equation, too. Drinking too much milk or juice can dampen an appetite, so you may want to serve milk between meals and limit juice to no more than 1/2 to 3/4 cup a day. Don't offer juice to infants younger than 1. Milk and 100 percent juice can supply vital nutrients (though too much juice means too much sugar, and fruit juice lacks the fiber and some nutrients found in fruit).And don't let her fill up on sweets and junk food  her growing body needs the nutrients supplied by a healthy diet, not empty calories.Extra vitaminsThe American Academy of Pediatrics says that a daily multivitamin isn't usually necessary if your toddler eats a variety of food. But if she doesn't eat much meat or fish, iron-fortified cereal, or iron-rich dark green vegetables, she may need an iron supplement. The best way to know whether your child needs a daily multivitamin  and what kind to give her  is to check with her doctor.And whether or not your doctor recommends a multivitamin, your child will still need some extra vitamin D. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus, which build bones. Sunscreen prevents sunlight from synthesizing vitamin D, and it's difficult to get this essential nutrient from milk alone, so doctors recommend giving children 400 international units (IUs) of vitamin D daily.Most multivitamins contain vitamin D. If your doctor recommends a multivitamin, your child will usually not need an extra vitamin D supplement.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2013a. Dietary supplements for toddlers.

Antibiotics in meat: What you need to know,https://www.babycenter.com/0_antibiotics-in-meat-what-you-need-to-know_11356.bc,"Should I be concerned about antibiotics in the meat I serve my child?Most experts say it's unlikely that you or your child will be harmed in the immediate future by the practice of giving antibiotics to livestock. Strict federal limits and industry regulations ensure that very little, if any, of the antibiotics given to animals make it to your table. But overusing antibiotics in livestock is something that you should be concerned about because of the potential threat to public health.Many farmers who raise cows, chickens, and other livestock use antibiotics to treat animals that are sick or at a high risk of becoming sick. But some critics believe the industry relies too heavily on antibiotics to fatten livestock and to compensate for unsanitary and crowded conditions in industrial-size farms  despite guidelines for antibiotic use, which specify that the medication be used judiciously.How can people be affected by the antibiotics that farmers use for animals?The main concern isn't that the antibiotics will be transferred to you or your child, but that they will increase the antibiotic resistance of bacteria that we all encounter. Experts warn that there are already many strains of bacteria that no longer respond to antibiotics.Just as taking antibiotics unnecessarily contributes to increased resistance in some strains of bacteria, overusing antibiotics in agriculture is contributing to the emergence of bacteria that are resistant to common antibiotics. The more an antibiotic is used, the more likely it is that bacteria will become resistant to it.Also, if too little antibiotic is used (as is often the case when antibiotics are used on healthy animals), it won't kill all the bacteria  and the survivors can grow and multiply into resistant strains.Some of these bacteria can spread to humans when proper handling and cooking procedures aren't followed. Bacteria can be consumed in meat that hasn't been heated to the proper temperature before serving, for example. And campylobacter (a bacteria found in the intestines of chickens) can be spread by handling raw chicken and not washing up afterward.According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of the antibiotic fluoroquinolone in chickens, bacteria resistant to that drug began showing up in humans.Antibiotics have even been found in vegetables grown in soil that was treated with animal manure. In a study funded by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), scientists at the University of Minnesota found that corn, lettuce, and potatoes grown in soil that had been spread with animal manure containing the veterinary antibiotic sulfamethazine also contained the antibiotic. Sulfamethazine is commonly used to treat bacterial diseases and promote growth in poultry, pigs, sheep, and cattle.In addition to the dangers of ingesting the antibiotic-resistant bacteria, it's also possible for drug-resistant bacteria to transfer their genetic material to other bacteria. This means that if you consume a harmless ""bug"" carrying a resistance-causing gene, that gene could be passed to a more harmful form of bacteria that's already in your body, makingitantibiotic resistant.There's no way for researchers to figure out how often this happens to people. But David Wallinga, a senior scientist at the Institute for Agriculture and Trade Policy, a nonprofit food, agriculture, and trade group based in Minneapolis, reports that the CDC has ""compelling evidence that people are contracting infections from resistant bugs at increasing rates that we can trace back to antibiotic use in animals.""The American Medical Association, the World Health Organization, the Union of Concerned Scientists, the American Public Health Association, and the American College of Preventive Medicine have all taken a stance against giving antibiotics to animals that aren't sick. The FDA has also urged people who raise animals to restrict the use of antibiotics to treating sick animals, not to promoting growth or preventing illnesses.If farmers cut back on antibiotics, won't more animals get illnesses like foot-and-mouth disease and mad cow disease?No. Neither foot-and-mouth disease nor mad cow disease is treated with antibiotics. But improving living conditions, without routinely using antibiotics, can prevent many of the diseases that animals contract.Is ""free-range"" poultry raised without antibiotics?It may be, but there's no guarantee. Only organic poultry products and those labeled ""no antibiotics added"" are guaranteed to come from animals that haven't been given antibiotics.""Free-range,"" as defined by the USDA, simply means that the birds have ""been allowed access"" to the outdoors. Consumers who are concerned about the humane treatment of farm animals support the free-range method, though debate continues about its definition.Nothing in the standards for free-range labeling prohibits use of preventive antibiotics, so unless the label specifically states that the product has been raised without the use of antibiotics, there's no way to tell whether these drugs have been used.When it comes to eggs, the nutritional content of regular eggs and eggs from free-range hens is the same, although the free-range eggs tend to be more expensive.Food cooperatives often know the source of their products, so if you'd like to make sure the eggs you buy are free-range, your local food co-op (or farmers' market) is probably the best bet.What about organic meat and poultry?Meat certified as organic comes from animals raised without antibiotics, hormones, or any other drugs or chemicals typically used in industrial agriculture. These products are becoming easier to find as demand increases. You can find them at many natural food stores, butcher shops, and even some supermarkets.Also, more and more food producers sell organic meat directly to consumers online or by phone. Farmers at smaller operations who raise animals without antibiotics or other drugs sell meat directly from their farm.While buying certified organic meat and poultry is one way to ensure that what you eat contains no hormones or antibiotics, some companies offer brands that are not certified organic but that are hormone- and antibiotic-free.Keep in mind that the label ""natural"" doesn't guarantee anything except that a product is minimally processed. You'll want to look for labels that specifically state ""no hormones"" and ""no antibiotics."""

The lowdown on children's vitamins,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-lowdown-on-childrens-vitamins_64355.bc,"Should I give my child a vitamin supplement?Experts disagree about whether a daily multivitamin or mineral supplement is necessary for all children. For example, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), advises giving your child a supplement only if your child's doctor recommends one. The AAP claims most children don't need supplements because so many common foods are fortified.On the other hand, the AAP acknowledges that taking a supplement won't do any harm as long as it doesn't exceed the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for any vitamin or mineral.Other experts believe that taking a daily supplement is a good way to compensate for any shortfalls in your child's diet.Most experts do agree that:Taking a daily supplement won't hurt as long as it doesn't exceed the RDA for any one vitamin or mineral.Some children  like vegetarians or those with food sensitivities  might need a daily supplement to meet the RDA for certain vitamins or minerals.Supplements are not a substitute for whole foods and should never be used to justify a poor diet. If your child isn't eating well, give him a multivitamin in addition to taking steps to improve his eating habits.The bottom line: If you're concerned that your child isn't meeting the requirements of a balanced diet listed in theU.S. Department of Agriculture's recommendations, a daily multivitamin or mineral supplement can't hurt.Should I give my child a vitamin if she's a picky eater?If you're concerned that your child's diet is lacking  because she won't put anything green in her mouth or because she goes on food jags for days  you might want to give her a supplement for your peace of mind.It provides a little extra insurance that she's getting what he needs, says dietitian Debby Demory-Luce.What kind of vitamin should I give my child?Any generic children's multivitamin (chewable or liquid) will do unless your child has special needs. For example, if your child is a vegetarian, you'll want to make sure that the supplement contains vitamins B12 and D, as well as riboflavin and calcium, which may be lacking in his diet. And if your doctor has determined that your child is anemic, she may recommend a supplement with a specific amount of iron.Also, children younger than 4 aren't able to grind foods when they chew, so give them liquid vitamins to prevent a choking hazard.Children often don't get enough Vitamin D, so the AAP recommends that most children  from babies to adolescents  take a supplement with 400 IU of vitamin D.Note that supplements often don't contain 100 percent of every vitamin and mineral, so you'll still want to make sure your child gets the needed vitamin or mineral from food sources too.If your child doesn't drink milk or eat enough dairy, for example, and only gets about 15 to 20 percent of the RDA for calcium from his supplement, then you'll need to find other food-based sources, such as calcium-fortified orange juice.When choosing a vitamin supplement for your child, read the label carefully. One national survey found that when young children who had diets low in certain nutrients were given vitamin supplements, some of the kids wound up getting more than the recommended upper limit of vitamin A, folic acid, and zinc. So it's a good idea to make sure the supplement you're giving your child isn't high in these nutrients unless your child's doctor says otherwise.Also, keep in mind that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't hold supplements to the same standards drugs must meet before they're manufactured, so quality and potency might vary between brands. (See our article onbuying supplementsfor guidance.)And don't substitute a vitamin drink for a vitamin supplement. Often vitamin drinks (including sports or energy drinks) contain caffeine and added sugar.Should I give my child more than one vitamin a day if his diet is especially bad one week?No. There's no reason to give your child more than the recommended daily dose (usually one pill a day). ""Some people think that a little is good but more is better,"" says Demory-Luce, ""but this is a dangerous way to approach vitamins.""Not only could it hurt your child, as with too much iron, but an overdose of certain vitamins could also prevent the absorption of others, creating a nutritional imbalance.What precautions should I take with vitamins?Vitamins are formulated to appeal to children and often resemble candy, so kids may eat several at a time if given the opportunity. But getting too much of certain vitamins and minerals (iron, in particular) could be dangerous, or even fatal.So treat vitamins as medicines. Make sure the caps are childproof, but don't depend on them  always keep vitamin bottles well out of the reach of your child.Dietitian Demory-Luce, mother of two, learned this lesson the hard way: ""My youngster got his hands on a bottle of vitamins, opened the safety top, and ate ten vitamins before I got to him,"" she says. ""Luckily, the vitamins didn't have iron in them."" Now she keeps vitamins locked away in a cabinet.To be safe, call poison control if you suspect that your child has taken vitamins on his own, even if they don't contain iron.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2013.

Helping a child who's underweight,https://www.babycenter.com/0_helping-a-child-whos-underweight_64368.bc,"How can I tell if my preschooler is too skinny?There are several factors to take into consideration when evaluating your child's weight. Has he always been thin? Are both of his parents very thin? A child who has a genetic tendency to be thin is in a different boat than a child who has always been normal to hefty and who has recently stopped gaining  or started losing  weight. Even if your child has just recently thinned out, though, there may be nothing to worry about.""Keep in mind that a child's weight is dynamic and changes with growth,"" says Stephen R. Daniels, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition.When an increase in height precedes a gain in weight, Daniels explains, your child may appear underweight for a while, until his weight gain catches up. It's also possible, though, for your child's weight gain to eventually outstrip his gain in height, resulting in his becoming overweight. Doctors are very concerned that many children are becoming overweight as they grow older, Daniels says, and some of those children started out as underweight.The best way to determine whether your child is underweight  and to find out what to do about it  is to make an appointment with his doctor so she can help you evaluate his weight and his diet. How will the doctor determine whether my child is underweight?Your child's doctor will take into consideration the factors mentioned above  how much his parents weigh and how long he's been thin. She'll also evaluate your child's eating habits and his overall health. She'll probably ask if your child has had any medical problems that may have contributed to weight loss, like chronic diarrhea or vomiting.The doctor will measure your child's height and weight and plot these numbers on a growth chart. Doctors today are using a new series of growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that take into consideration a child's body mass index, or BMI, which considers weight together with height to help determine whether they are proportional. The BMI is a better indicator of body composition than a weight measurement alone. While an adult's BMI is calculated with a straight formula of height and weight, the formula to determine a child's BMI takes into consideration gender and age as well, to allow for the fact that body composition changes as a child gets older.If your child's BMI falls below the 5th percentile, he's considered underweight. The doctor will ask you questions about your child's diet, so she can pinpoint any major deficiencies. She may have you refer to the Food Guide Pyramid, so you can determine which food groups your child may not be getting enough of. She'll do a physical examination and may run laboratory tests to determine if there's an underlying medical cause, especially if your child seems to be eating well but not gaining weight. How can I help my child gain weight?Assuming your child has no underlying medical concerns, the idea will be to get him to take in more calories. For some children, simply adding foods that are ""heart-healthy"" sources of fat such as avocados, nuts, and vegetable oils  provides enough additional calories to meet the demands of growth. Try to plan healthy, calorie-dense meals and snacks for your child so he gets enough to eat.Whatever you do, don't feed your child ""junk food"" in an effort to promote weight gain, warns Daniels. Eating habits are ingrained early in life, and they may be difficult to change once they become established.Make mealtimes pleasant and unrushed. Sit down together whenever you can and enjoy your food and time together. Involve your child in meal planning, shopping (enlist his help picking out fruit at the market and bread at the bakery, for example), and food preparation, to encourage his interest in food and eating. Also, don't let your child get so wrapped up doing something that he skips meals. He needs to be eating frequently if you want him to gain weight.Here is a list of healthy high-calorie foods that you might offer your child:Dairy: Whole milk, cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, creamed soups, puddingProtein: Eggs, peanut butter, bean soups, nutsCarbohydrates: Bread, macaroni and cheese, pasta, French toast, pancakes, mashed potatoes, hot cerealIf your child is a picky eater and refuses to add new foods to his diet, his doctor may recommend a high-calorie supplement drink. These supplements taste like milkshakes and provide additional vitamins and minerals that your child may be missing out on.Make sure, though, that your child isn't filling up on beverages  like juices or even milk  so that he's not hungry for meals. Try to limit juice to no more than one cup a day and milk to no more than two cups a day.While you'll be eager to check on his progress, don't start subjecting your child to regular weigh-ins at home, because they may make him anxious and self-conscious about his weight. However, your doctor may want to see your child once a month to monitor his progress. Treat these visits like any other to the doctor, and don't make a big deal about the weigh-in process.What if my child doesn't start gaining weight?If your child is getting enough calories but still does not seem to be gaining weight appropriately, continue to work with his doctor to discover any underlying conditions. On the other hand, if your child is refusing to eat, there may be a psychological reason that you'll want to discuss with a child therapist. Your child's doctor can provide a referral.Chances are good, though, that with some patience and some conscientious meal and snack plans, your child will strike a good height/weight balance."
How to find the best preschool for your child,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-find-the-best-preschool-for-your-child_64548.bc,"Once you decide your child is ready for preschool, it's time to find a good program. It pays to start your search early. Some families  especially ones who live in big cities  apply to the best schools as soon as their child is born. We kid you not.After you've identified a few promising schools, apply to all of them. That way, if you don't get into your first choice, you'll have one or two as backup. To find the best program for your child, follow the six steps below.Identify your prioritiesFirst, decide what you want. Are you looking for a preschool near your workplace, or would one closer to home be more convenient?Do you want the curriculum to include activities such as dancing and storytelling? Are you looking for a specific approach to learning? (Learn about top five preschool philosophies.)Write everything down so you have a list to refer to as you evaluate different programs.Do your researchAsk around to find the most reputable preschools. Friends and family can give you the names of schools they like, and we all know that personal references are the best kind.Ask some experts. The Child Care Aware hotline (800-424-2246) can give you the number of a local childcare resource and referral agency, which in turn can direct you to licensed preschools in your area. Better yet, ask for a list of accredited schools near you. While accreditation isn't a guarantee that a particular preschool will be right for your child, in general, a stamp of approval from the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) is a reliable sign of quality childcare.Go online. Both NAEYC and the National Association of Family Child Care have websites. Visit them for guidelines and contact information. NAEYC also has a searchable online database of accredited centers and preschools.Check the yellow pages online, too. The yellow pages lists preschools in your area and their websites and allows parents to rate them.Visit and interviewYou can ask a few preliminary questions over the phone (about fees or enrollment, for example), but you won't get a sense of what a preschool is really like until you go there and meet the staff.Ask the director about everything from hours, fees, and vacation schedules to philosophies on childrearing topics such as discipline and nutrition. Also, get a copy of the daily schedule.Trust your gut feeling about the place and notice how the director handles your questions. Take along our helpful printable preschool interview sheet on your visits.When you visit the classrooms, check the teacher-child ratios and note how many children are in a classroom. The NAEYC recommends 2- and 3-year-olds be in groups of no more than 18, with at least two teachers. For 3- to 4-year-olds, the organization recommends groups of 20 or fewer, again with at least two teachers. As many as 20 5-year-olds can be in a class with two or more teachers.""It's easier to give one-on-one attention and be responsive when there are fewer kids in a room,"" says Stephanie Glowacki, former director of accreditation programs at NAEYC.Observe how the teachers interact with the kids: Make sure they're friendly, caring, and encouraging. You'll also want a challenging curriculum, experienced teachers (who are paid well and satisfied with their job), and an environment that's warm, clean, and safe.Ask about staff turnover. If the teachers change every six months, move on. Children need consistency and the opportunity to form strong relationships with their caregivers, so you don't want a preschool where teachers come and go.Ultimately, choosing a preschool is a personal decision. If, after visiting a preschool, you love the idea of your child going there, it's probably the right place for you.""The preschool we chose was strong in arts and music, and the location was convenient,"" says Winn Ellis, a counselor in San Francisco and mother of two girls. ""But what really sold us was the cheerful atmosphere. The kids seem genuinely happy to be there.""For more information about what to look for in a preschool, see our articles on signs of a good preschool and signs of a bad preschool.Check referencesPositive word of mouth is a powerful endorsement. If a preschool has a certain buzz, ask parents what they like about it.Ask each school you're considering for a list of parents whose children have attended the school. Call them and ask specific questions. Don't just ask whether they like the preschool: Ask exactly what they like about it and what they don't. If their child no longer goes to the school, ask why.You may also want to call your state's Better Business Bureau to see whether any complaints have been filed against the school or its teachers.Kid-test itVisit the school with your child. That way you can see how he and the teachers interact and whether he seems comfortable in the preschool's environment. Do the teachers seem interested in getting to know your child? Does he enjoy the activities?""I knew we'd made the right decision based on my daughter's reaction,"" says Svetlana Robledo, a San Francisco journalist. ""Nina was brimming with joy after one day there and couldn't stop talking about all the things she was learning and doing.""Get on the waiting listIf the preschool of your dreams has no openings, don't despair. Put yourself on the waiting list, and while you're at it, write a letter explaining why you like the school so much. It won't guarantee you a place, but it can't hurt to let the school know how enthusiastic you are about the program.In the meantime, if you've applied to more than one school, it's likely you'll have other options to consider.Go to our main preschool area."
How to travel successfully with young kids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-travel-successfully-with-young-kids_65302.bc,"Before you goPrepare your child for what he can expect. You may be seeking new and exciting experiences, but small children thrive on familiarity, says Judith Hudson, a child development specialist and associate professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. ""My husband and I once vacationed with a couple who brought their two kids along. When it was time for bed the mother pulled out a brand-new red sleeping bag, assuming her 2-year-old would love the novelty of spending the night in it,"" Hudson says. ""But when her son saw his new sleeping bag, he began crying and announced, 'Big red bag  bad. No bed.'""From his perspective it was strange not to sleep in a bed,"" Hudson says, ""and when you're 2 years old, strange usually means bad.""The more you prepare your child for what you know will happen, the more secure he'll feel when facing new surroundings and activities. Whenever possible, let him wear new clothing and try out new vacation gear ahead of time, whether it's a sleeping bag, swimming goggles, a swimsuit, flip-flops, or a snowsuit.Bring along the comforts of home. One of the best ways to help your child settle into a new place is to travel with familiar comfort objects. A favorite book, night-light, pillow (or pillowcase, if you're tight on space), glow-in-the-dark stick-on stars, or even a cool flashlight will help him feel more relaxed in a new environment. A stuffed animal can be a great traveling buddy  just be aware that loveys can get lost. Consider bringing a few new cuddlies and leaving the dearly beloved safe at home.Another crucial item to pack is an umbrella stroller, even if your child no longer uses it when you're at home. Young kids can get extra tired on vacation.Have a home base. Because young children are more content in familiar surroundings, plan a vacation that revolves around one location rather than a trip requiring frequent changes of lodging. Save the whirlwind tour of coastal New England for when your child is older and better able to adjust to change (maybe even to welcome it). Instead, focus on one or two charming seaside towns and plan some interesting day excursions.Choose your campground carefully. If you're a veteran car camper and know basic wilderness safety skills, there's no reason not to take your little one camping. However, you will probably have a more relaxed time if you find a campground that offers a playground, supervised swimming, and a camp store (so you won't be caught without sunscreen and bug spray). Also, make sure the campsite is child-safe  in other words, not near any dangerous drops or bodies of water.Consider a family-friendly resort. Your preschooler probably won't have the strength, skill, or experience to participate in many of the activities at a family resort, such as snorkeling, waterskiing, or downhill skiing. But many family resorts offer excellent beginner programs that playfully introduce young children to these activities. For example, a ski resort might have structured ""snow play"" in which your child could scoot around on small skis for the morning but wouldn't actually ride a chair lift or ski downhill.When evaluating a resort's babysitting services or supervised activities for kids, don't be shy about asking the same questions you might ask a prospective childcare provider back home: What are the credentials of the staff? What is the child-staff ratio? Do they accept children who are still in diapers? Do they provide snacks and meals? What kinds of activities do they offer? Ask for a physical description of the facility or a brochure with pictures. The last thing you want is to count on vacation childcare, only to discover a dingy, depressing hole-in-the-wall. Once you're thereBe flexible. Rigid rules can smother even the best of family vacations. To keep the trip relaxing and to accommodate a restless youngster, for example, consider letting your child sleep in the same bed with you at night. Rather than spending a lot of time preparing a meal or searching for a restaurant that meets your nutritional requirements, loosen your standards a bit and give in to the fast-food restaurant where your child can climb on the outdoor play equipment.Keep it simple. If your child is like most, he thrives in situations where there's plenty of time to explore and move at his own pace. You'll also feel more relaxed if you simply spend time with your child rather than spending lots of money and effort trying to entertain him. My husband and I once took our 3-year-old daughter on an Austrian Christmas vacation, imagining that she would love all the exciting activities we planned, such as a horse-drawn carriage ride through Salzburg and sledding in Innsbruck. While she somewhat enjoyed these excursions, her most joyful moment was when we stumbled on a playground and let her frolic with children her own age. As it turned out, this led to a memorable experience for my husband and me as well: We met an Austrian family at the playground who invited us to their home for dinner.Build in downtime. ""Even if your child no longer takes a nap, remember that traveling can be overwhelming and exhausting for young children,"" says Hudson. When planning an itinerary, avoid locking yourself into a full day of touring New York City or even spending the entire day at a theme park. ""Children in this age group will be much happier if they're given quiet time to process all the stimulation,"" says Hudson. This may mean scheduling an hour of rest back at home base, or simply offering a half-hour snuggle and read-aloud time before going out to dinner. When it comes to bedtime, use the same routines you keep at home, such as dinner, bath, and a story.Get outside. If you're really into sightseeing, choose destinations where your child can roam free. ""While your 3-year-old won't care about the history of a Civil War battleground, he'll certainly love running through the fields and climbing on the cannons,"" says Hudson. Also, try to eat at outdoor restaurants or have picnics whenever possible. Says Hudson, ""Most young children hate having to sit still while they wait for their food to arrive and will appreciate the freedom."""

Dinners kids will come running for,https://www.babycenter.com/0_dinners-kids-will-come-running-for_66893.bc,"Coming up with meals that will satisfy your whole family  and nurture growing bodies  can be a challenge. Expand your kids' palates with these ideas for nutritious, delicious meals that won't make them turn up their noses.Cheesy cauliflower casseroleTime: 25 minutesIf your kids like macaroni and cheese, try this delicious  and more nutritious  variation. Chop a head of cauliflower into bite-size pieces. Add the cauliflower and your kids' favorite pasta to a large pot of boiling water. (A 1-pound package of pasta generally serves a family of five or six.)Cook until the noodles are tender, usually about 10 minutes. Drain and pour into a pasta bowl. Stir in a tablespoon or two of olive oil. Then add pepper, grated Parmesan cheese, and corn (or chopped black olives if your kids like them). Toss and serve with a salad or a side of steamed carrots.Soup and sandwichesTime: 30 minutesBelieve it or not, you can create a delicious homemade vegetable soup in almost no time at all. In a 2-quart pot, saut a chopped onion in olive oil. Add a cup of canned low-sodium broth, 2 cups of coarsely chopped fresh or canned tomatoes, a drained can of beans, and a cup of fresh, frozen, or drained canned corn. Toss in any other suitable veggies you have in the crisper. Simmer until done, and dust lightly with pepper.For sandwiches, choose whole grain bread, line a platter with lettuce, tomato slices, and your family's favorite fillings, and let them all make their own. Instead of mayonnaise, which is loaded with fat, put a few types of mustard on the table, or consider offering pesto or mashed avocado as an alternative spread.Tacos two waysTime: 20 minutesAll you need are taco shells or corn tortillas, some chopped lettuce (choose romaine or red leaf as a healthier alternative to iceberg), a coarsely chopped tomato, drained canned black beans, a jar of mild salsa, and some grated Monterey Jack cheese. Put the fillings on the table and let the kids create their own Mexican masterpieces.See if your child will be happy using warmed corn tortillas instead of hard taco shells (which have been fried). Just stack the tortillas together, wrap them in a damp paper towel, and microwave on high for 30 seconds.Or try this Polynesian twist using shrimp: In a pan with a tablespoon of canola oil, saut a pound of fresh or frozen small shrimp with a teaspoon each of ground cumin and chili powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder until the shrimp are warmed through. (Adjust the spices to suit your child's taste.) Add a can of drained black beans, a cup or so of corn kernels (fresh or frozen), a drained 8-ounce can of crushed pineapple, and 1/2 cup of salsa.When everything is thoroughly warmed through, spoon the filling into warmed tortillas or taco shells. Optional toppings are shredded cheese, diced avocado, chopped tomato, and light sour cream. Quick homemade pizzaTime: 30 minutesPremade pizza crusts, available in most grocery stores, make crowd-pleasing pizzas a breeze to put together. Spread the crust with tomato sauce, then get your children to help with the toppings  a tactic that raises the odds even picky eaters will do more than nibble off the cheese.Encourage the kids to be creative, and tell them to pick at least two vegetables. Great combinations include onions and sweet red peppers, spinach and black olives, and corn and sliced tomatoes.If your family likes pizza with meat, add reduced-fat pepperoni or cooked extra-lean ground beef for flavor. (A little goes a long way.) Finish the pie with a light sprinkling of mozzarella cheese, and cook according to the instructions on the package. Serve with a salad of mixed greens.Chicken and veggie stir-fryTime: 35 minutesKids will love this dish because it's delicious and satisfying, and you'll love it because it's quick and nutritious. Mix 1/3 cup of orange juice, 1 tablespoon of soy sauce (low sodium, if you want), 1 tablespoon of Szechuan sauce, and 2 teaspoons of cornstarch in a small bowl.Heat a tablespoon of canola oil in a wok or other large, deep cooking pan, and add a pound of boneless, skinless chicken breast, cut into small chunks. Stir-fry for 5 to 7 minutes over medium-high heat.Toss in a few cups of shredded cabbage and broccoli florets (fresh or frozen), a small package of snow peas, and the sauce mixture. Cook for about five minutes until the veggies are heated through. Serve over brown rice and sprinkle with sesame seeds. If your family likes spicy food, serve with an Asian hot sauce on the side.BBQ veggie slidersTime: 30 minutesThese little veggie burgers fit perfectly in small hands.In a food processor or with a hand blender, pure two 15.5-ounce cans of rinsed and drained garbanzo beans until smooth. Stir in a cup of shredded carrot (about one large carrot), three finely chopped green onions, and salt and pepper to taste. Add one-third cup of whole wheat flour a little at a time until the mixture holds together.Form the mixture into 12 small patties, and cook them in a skillet or on a grill until each side is browned (about four minutes per side). Serve the burgers on toasted mini whole grain hamburger buns with avocado, tomato, and barbecue sauce as toppings.Learn more:Nutrition guidelines for young childrenHow to get your grade-schooler to eat more healthy food10 ways to please a picky eaterShow sources Hide sources AND. 2014.

Quick and healthy snacks for school-age kids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_quick-and-healthy-snacks-for-school-age-kids_66905.bc,"In just minutes, you can prepare nutritious snacks your child will love. Offering a broad variety of food helps her get the vitamins and minerals she needs. Remember to use non-fat or low-fat dairy products and choose whole -grain breads and cereals.Here are a few quick, easy, and healthy snack suggestions:Fresh fruit.Nothing's better than fresh fruit: It's colorful, sweet and juicy, packed with vitamins and minerals, and full of fiber. Serve sliced apple, orange sections, a banana, or a bowl of berries. Kids love finger food, making this an easy and fun way to enjoy a nutritious snack.Dried and pured fruit. Offer a handful of dried apricots, peaches, pairs, and pitted prunes, or serve a small bowl of applesauce (the kind without added sugar).Dips. Give your child the option of mixing and dipping his favorite foods. You might be surprised at the combinations your child is willing to try  let him explore and have fun.Give him a few wedges of pita bread paired with a small bowl of hummus or spinach dip. Strawberries and apple slices go well with creamy yogurt, and pretzels taste great with a variety of sweet and savory mustards.Cottage cheese. Serve in a small bowl topped with chopped fresh fruit, or mix in peas and carrots to make confetti cottage cheese.Eggs. Scrambled eggs take just a few minutes. Try adding turkey and cheese, or mix in salsa and wrap it up in a tortilla for a burrito. Make hard-cooked eggs on the weekend and store them in the fridge for weekday snacks.Mini pizza. Toast half an English muffin and spread about a tablespoon of marinara sauce on it. Add some chopped vegetables and a tablespoon of shredded cheese and broil in the oven for a minute or twountil the cheese melts.Parfait party. Layer a small bowl or dessert glass with one-third cup of vanilla yogurt, one-quarter cup of chopped fruit, and a few berries or banana slices. Sprinkle a little granola on the top.Mini quesadilla. Sprinkle one small corn tortilla with a couple of tablespoons of shredded cheese and microwave for 20 seconds. Fold in half and cut into wedges. Serve with a small bowl of mild salsa for dipping.Waffles. Toast a frozen waffle and top with a spoonful of yogurt and some fresh fruit.Vegetables. Get your child in the habit of snacking on vegetables. Fresh veggies like carrot sticks, green beans, and broccoli pair well with dip. Bake veggie ""chips"" with carrots, beets, or sweet potatoes. Roasted kale is a delicious way to serve greens.Edamame. These vitamin-packed beans are a great source of vegetarian protein. Look for bags of edamame shelled or in their pods in the freezer case. They only need to be boiled a few minutes if they aren't already precooked.Light popcorn. Some brands of popcorn are swimming in butter or partially hydrogenated vegetable oil (which can clog arteries). But there are healthier brands surprisingly low in fat and, like all popcorn, high in fiber.For convenience, buy bags of pre-popped popcorn but check the nutritional content. If you're microwaving or making air-popped popcorn, sprinkle hot popcorn with Parmesan cheese for added flavor.Nuts. It's a bum rap: Nuts are high in fat, but it's the kind that's as good for the heart and arteries as olive oil. (The exception is macadamia nuts, which are high in saturated fat.) Nuts are also loaded with protein and essential vitamins and minerals  and they're wonderfully filling.You might want to toss together a custom mix of GORP (good old raisins and peanuts) for a portable, high-energy snack.Granola bars. A crunchy granola bar has whole grains, fiber, and protein. But watch out for granola bars that are more like candy bars  be sure to buy ones low in sugar. Try serving with yogurt for dipping.Sunflower seeds. High in fiber and protein, sunflower seeds are a powerhouse for growing kids. Sure, they're relatively high in fat, but most of it is monounsaturated, the healthful kind found in olive oil and nuts.Frozen fruit bars. The best of these frozen treats contain chunks of real fruit. You can buy them in the store or make them yourself with 100 percent juice and chopped, fresh fruit, or by freezing a smoothie. Try orange, pineapple, peach, and banana, to name a few. They're a great, fat-free refresher (and especially fun for your child to make).Frozen grapes. If your child resists eating fruit, try keeping a bowl of rinsed grapes in the freezer. They're rich in antioxidants, and freezing grapes seems to transform them into bonbons in the eyes of kids. (If you're worried about choking, cut grapes into smaller pieces.)Raisins. Loaded with antioxidants and high in carbohydrates (an immediate source of energy), raisins are also high in fiber and iron. Plus, kids love those little single-serving boxes.Fruit juice. Make sure it's100 percent fruit juice and limit your child to no more than three-quarters of a cup daily. For a healthy, balanced snack, try a small glass of juice and a few crackers with a tablespoon or two of cream cheese or all-natural peanut butter (which has no sugar added).Fruit shakes. Throw a banana, half a cup of milk, and a handful of berries in your blender, and you've got a nutritious shake. Add yogurt for more flavor, protein, and calcium. For the best consistency, use frozen fruit.Orange freeze. Blend a peeled orange with a cup or two of ice in an electric blender. Adjust flavor with a little sweetener.Peanut butter powerball. Mix peanut butter with cornflakes and shape into balls. Roll in crushed graham crackers.Pita pockets. Cut pita bread in half. Spoon ricotta cheese into a pita pocket and add apple slices. Sprinkle with cinnamon.Mighty muffins. Mix a couple tablespoons of cream cheese with some sunflower seeds and chopped, dried fruit. Spread on half a toasted English muffin.Get more tips for healthy snacks and meals."
Quick and healthy packed lunches,https://www.babycenter.com/0_quick-and-healthy-packed-lunches_66913.bc,"Follow these simple tips and suggestions for lunches that are yummy AND nutritious.Find out what your child really likesYou can pack a lunch full of healthy foods, but if your child doesn't like it, she won't eat it  period. Look for acceptable alternatives to food she doesn't like. If she won't eat apples, for example, try fruits like melon, oranges, kiwis, or persimmons  all of which have vitamin C and other fortifying substances.If you want to encourage her to try something different, tuck in new foods along with familiar favorites. Don't overdo it, though: Too many unfamiliar foods might put her off her lunch entirely.If your child is picky, try doing a taste test at home to select ""winners"" for her packed lunches. Set out a few vegetable options, for example, or types of dip and have her sample each to see which she likes best. Look for good options in the same food group: If she won't eat chicken, try turkey or tuna. Or if she won't drink milk try low-fat yogurt or cheese.Encourage your child to help make her lunchChildren who set their own menus are more likely to eat when lunchtime rolls around. Take your child shopping with you, and let him pick out fresh fruit, vegetables, and snacks. Invite him to help you pack his lunch and snacks.Preparing food together is a good opportunity to teach him about balanced meals. Check out the federal nutritional guidelines for children at ChooseMyPlate.gov for guidance.Be flexibleNot everything your child eats has to be packed with vitamins and minerals. Treats are fine. Just make sure you tuck at least two wholesome items into every lunch bag.Along with the main dish, add a piece of fruit, a box of raisins, or a handful of sliced carrots, edamame, or other vegetables. Include a container of water, low-fat milk, or 100 percent fruit juice.Reimagine the sandwichIf your child is tired of conventional sandwiches, ditch the bread and try pitas, tortillas, bagels, or even lettuce wraps.Try making pinwheel sandwiches. Spread low-fat mayonnaise, cream cheese, or creamy dressing on a tortilla or flatbread and add sandwich toppings. Roll up tightly and cut into slices.Or use a bento box to deconstruct the classic lunchbox sandwich. Place mini chicken sausages, rolled up lunch meats, cheese cubes, olives, pickles  whatever your child likes  in separate compartments.Another option is a bagel sandwich. Split a mini bagel (or half of a whole bagel), and layer sandwich toppings. Try an apple bagel sandwich with cheddar cheese, apple slices, and cinnamon. Or you could stir some jam into light cream cheese and spread it on a bagel or even toasted whole wheat waffles.Have dinner for lunchLast night's leftovers make an easy lunch. If your child devoured spaghetti tossed with olive oil and Parmesan cheese last night, she'll probably eat the leftovers the next day. You can freshen it up by adding a few meatballs, olives, or cooked vegetables.Mix leftover veggies with rice or pasta for a fast, ""new"" meal, or turn them into soup or stew. Roast chicken can be shredded and served with salad, soup, or noodles. Stir-fried vegetables get a fresh treatment rolled up in a whole wheat tortilla.Keep favorites freshUse your child's favorite foods to lead her to new tastes. If your child loves yogurt, for example, start with her favorite kind  vanilla is usually a hit  and then add low-fat granola or another crunchy cereal with a tablespoon or two of raisins or sunflower seeds. Stir everything together, or keep the crunchy mix-ins separate for your child to stir in at lunchtime.Try flavored yogurt as a dip with fruit, or freeze a low-fat yogurt tube and pack it in her lunch. (It will thaw by lunchtime.) For an extra protein boost, try substituting low- or nonfat Greek yogurt.Crunchy yogurtStart with your child's favorite yogurt  vanilla is usually a hit  then stir in half a cup of low-fat granola or another good-munching cereal. Add a tablespoon or two of raisins, chopped walnuts, peanuts, or sunflower seeds. You can seal it all in a plastic container or leave the yogurt in its carton and pack the mix-ins in a sandwich bag. (Don't forget to slip a spoon into the lunch bag.) For a special weekend lunch at home, serve crunchy yogurt with fresh melon or a sliced banana.Think smallOffer small portions of different foods. You can make a meal out of appetizers if they're healthy: grapes and strawberries, cherry tomatoes and chunks of low-fat cheese, cut-up melon, olives and chunks of cooked chicken, and firm tofu cubes are just a few options.Pack whole wheat crackers with deli meat, cheese slices, and vegetables. Tuck in a few quesadilla wedges, a hard-cooked egg, or a sampling of fruit and cheese.Offer hummus or low-fat ranch dressing and cut-up vegetables for dipping. Include familiar favorites  perhaps baby carrots and celery  and throw in a surprise, like jicama. She just might eat it!Show sources Hide sources Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. 2013a.

Helping a child who's underweight (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_helping-a-child-whos-underweight-ages-5-to-8_66923.bc,"How can I tell if my child is too skinny?There are several factors to take into consideration when evaluating your child's weight. Has he always been thin? Are both of his parents very thin? A child who has a genetic tendency to be thin is in a different boat than a child who has always been normal to hefty and who has recently stopped gaining  or started losing  weight. Even if your child has just recently thinned out, though, there may be nothing to worry about.""Keep in mind that a child's weight is dynamic and changes with growth,"" says Stephen R. Daniels, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition.When an increase in height precedes a gain in weight, Daniels explains, your child may appear underweight for a while, until his weight gain catches up. It's also possible, though, for your child's weight gain to eventually outstrip his gain in height, resulting in his becoming overweight. Doctors are very concerned that many children are becoming overweight as they grow older, Daniels says, and some of those children started out as underweight.The best way to determine whether your child is underweight  and to find out what to do about it  is to make an appointment with his doctor so she can help you evaluate his weight and his diet.How will the doctor determine whether my child is underweight?Your child's doctor will take into consideration the factors mentioned above  how much his parents weigh and how long he's been thin. She'll also evaluate your child's eating habits and his overall health. She'll probably ask if your child has had any medical problems that may have contributed to weight loss, like chronic diarrhea or vomiting.The doctor will measure your child's height and weight and plot these numbers on a growth chart. Doctors today are using a new series of growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that take into consideration a child's body mass index, or BMI, which considers weight together with height to help determine whether they are proportional. The BMI is a better indicator of body composition than a weight measurement alone. While an adult's BMI is calculated with a straight formula of height and weight, the formula to determine a child's BMI takes into consideration gender and age as well, to allow for the fact that body composition changes as a child gets older.If your child's BMI falls below the 5th percentile, he's considered underweight. The doctor will ask you questions about your child's diet, so she can pinpoint any major deficiencies. She may have you refer to the Food Guide Pyramid, so you can determine which food groups your child may not be getting enough of. She'll do a physical examination and may run laboratory tests to determine if there's an underlying medical cause, especially if your child seems to be eating well but not gaining weight. How can I help my child gain weight?Assuming your child has no underlying medical concerns, the idea will be to get him to take in more calories. For some children, simply adding foods that are ""heart-healthy"" sources of fat such as avocados, nuts, and vegetable oils  provides enough additional calories to meet the demands of growth. Try to plan healthy, calorie-dense meals and snacks for your child so he gets enough to eat.Whatever you do, don't feed your child ""junk food"" in an effort to promote weight gain, warns Daniels. Eating habits are ingrained early in life, and they may be difficult to change once they become established.Make mealtimes pleasant and unrushed. Sit down together whenever you can and enjoy your food and time together. Involve your child in meal planning, shopping (enlist his help picking out fruit at the market and bread at the bakery, for example), and food preparation, to encourage his interest in food and eating. Also, don't let your child get so wrapped up doing something that he skips meals. He needs to be eating frequently if you want him to gain weight.Here is a list of healthy high-calorie foods that you might offer your child:Dairy: Whole milk, cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, creamed soups, puddingProtein: Eggs, peanut butter, bean soups, nutsCarbohydrates: Bread, macaroni and cheese, pasta, French toast, pancakes, mashed potatoes, hot cerealIf your child is a picky eater and refuses to add new foods to his diet, his doctor may recommend a high-calorie supplement drink. These supplements taste like milkshakes and provide additional vitamins and minerals that your child may be missing out on.Make sure, though, that your child isn't filling up on beverages  like juices or even milk  so that he's not hungry for meals. Try to limit juice to no more than one cup a day and milk to no more than two cups a day.While you'll be eager to check on his progress, don't start subjecting your child to regular weigh-ins at home, because they may make him anxious and self-conscious about his weight. However, your doctor may want to see your child once a month to monitor his progress. Treat these visits like any other to the doctor, and don't make a big deal about the weigh-in process.What if my child doesn't start gaining weight?If your child is getting enough calories but still does not seem to be gaining weight appropriately, continue to work with his doctor to discover any underlying conditions. On the other hand, if your child is refusing to eat, there may be a psychological reason that you'll want to discuss with a child therapist. Your child's doctor can provide a referral.Chances are good, though, that with some patience and some conscientious meal and snack plans, your child will strike a good height/weight balance."
How to talk to your child about drugs,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-talk-to-your-child-about-drugs_67124.bc,"What to expect at this ageDrugs are something of an abstraction for most kindergartners. They generally don't know the names of illicit drugs, such as marijuana or cocaine or heroin, and they may not know these kinds of illegal substances exist at all. At this age children focus on the here and now, and unless drug use is something they see going on around them, it doesn't come across their radar. Consequently, any discussion of drug use is most effective when it deals with maintaining good health and avoiding things that could hurt their bodies.This is the right time, however, for you to help your kindergartner learn values and decision-making skills that she can use to resist drugs later on. If your kindergartner doesn't hear you state your values firmly, she won't know what they are  and she'll begin forming her own according to what she hears from friends and TV programs. So take advantage of this trusting age to teach your child what is right. ""At this age, if parents tell them it's bad, they believe it's bad,"" says Paul Coleman, a father, family therapist, and author of How to Say It to Your Kids.How to talk about itDiscuss the dangers in terms she can understand. It's not necessary to teach your 5-year-old the specific names of illicit drugs. Instead, focus on things she already knows are bad, like cigarettes. ""You remember how we said smoking hurts your body? Well, there's a drug in cigarettes that makes them bad for you, and sometimes people use other drugs that are bad for you, too."" She can also learn that medicines are drugs, and that medicines can hurt her if she takes them in the wrong amounts or at the wrong times.Be approachable. Although you're probably not having in-depth discussions about drugs with your child just yet, now is the time to establish yourself as a parent who will answer any question  no matter how challenging or alarming  thoughtfully and calmly. By the time your child reaches middle school and starts to have serious questions about drug use, it helps to have already had a history of heart-to-heart talks.Talk about good health. When your kindergartner asks, for the tenth time, for another piece of candy after school, resist the temptation to snap, ""I told you already, no candy before dinner!"" Instead, explain your rule  even if you feel like you explain it every single day  and make sure your answer focuses on health and nutrition: ""Why can't you have more candy right now? Because too much sugar is bad for your body. It won't make you healthy and strong, but it will tire you out and hurt your teeth. And if you eat a lot of sugary snacks before dinner, you won't have room in your tummy for healthy foods."" If you've taught her the importance of taking care of her body all along, when she's older she'll be less likely to want to risk drug use.Teach her how to say no. If your 5-year-old can learn to assert her views confidently, she'll be better able to withstand the peer pressure of the preteen and teen years, when experimentation with drugs is increasingly common. Listen to her when she states her opinions, and when you disagree with her, do so with respect. Kids who consistently hear, ""That's a silly idea, why would anyone think that?"" or ""Don't you argue with me!"" are, as teens, less sure of themselves, more rebellious, and less able to heed those inner voices preaching good sense.Make sure your values are clear. You might think your child is aware of your beliefs about drugs, alcohol, and other dangerous substances, but she can't learn them through osmosis. It's your job, as the parent, to communicate your values clearly. You can let your child know that you value self-discipline, which will help her withstand the dangers of drugs when she's older. You don't need to lecture. It's enough to let her see that you can withstand temptations (at least most of the time). ""Mmmm,"" you can say after finishing dessert, ""That bowl of ice cream was good. And it was just the right amount. Eating more would be bad for my body and might even make me feel sick.""Reassure your child that you approve of her. Children are more vulnerable to drug use if their self-esteem is low or if they're starved for affection and attention. Build a good foundation early on by telling your child often how much you love her, and praise her genuinely whenever she deserves it. What kids ask ... What parents answer""What are drugs?"" Kindergartners are unlikely to ask questions about drug use unless they hear someone talking about it. But since drug education starts early in many public schools, your child may come home and proudly state, ""I'm against drugs!"" and, in the next breath, ask, ""What's a drug?"" You can tell her, ""Some drugs are good drugs, like the medicines our doctor gives us when we get sick. They help our bodies get better  but only if we take the right amount at the right time. That's why you only take them when I'm here to help you. Bad drugs are ones we should never take. They make our bodies sick and can even kill people who take them.""""How can a drug hurt you?"" A kindergartner who hears that there are bad drugs probably has no idea how they can hurt you. Explain by drawing parallels with other things the child does understand. ""You know how too much candy can give you a tummy-ache? Drugs can be like that  only worse. They get inside your body and can make you feel sick in your stomach, or dizzy, or bad in other ways.""""What does 'drug addiction' mean?"" Again, your 5-year-old is unlikely to hear this term, but if she does (say, from a public service ad on TV), she'll want to understand it. You can explain very simply: ""An addiction means that you want something so badly you can't stop taking it, even if you know it's hurting you.""""Can I try some of Emily's pink medicine?"" Since children's medicines and vitamins are made to look and taste good, kids may be tempted to try a sibling's medication  or they may ask for medicine when they're not sick. Be sure to firmly tell your child, ""You should never try someone else's medicine. You should only take medicine when the doctor says your body needs it, and when I'm here to help you take it. You could become very, very sick  or even die  if you take the wrong medicine."""
The connection between sleep and growth,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-connection-between-sleep-and-growth_3658985.bc,"Getting enough sleep is important for a young child for many reasons, from restoring energy to building brain connections. And evidence shows that sleep also fuels physical growth.The science of growingGrowth is a complex process that requires multiple hormones to initiate various biological events in the blood, organs, muscles, and bones. One of the most important is growth hormone (or ""human growth hormone""), which is secreted by the pituitary gland.Several factors affect its production, including nutrition, stress, and exercise. In young children, however, sleep is the main factor. Growth hormone is released throughout the day, but in kids, the most intense release period is shortly after the beginning of deep sleep.How much sleep do kids need?Every child is different, with some kids requiring slightly less or more sleep than their peers. But in general, 1- and 2-year-olds need 11 to 14 hours of sleep (including naps), and 3- to 5-year-olds need 10 to 13 hours (including naps) over a 24-hour period.Without adequate sleep, growth problems  mainly slow or stunted growth  can result. Kids with certain physical sleep problems, such as obstructive sleep apnea, also may have disrupted growth hormone production.Getting a good night's sleepMost kids need more sleep than their parents think.Signs that your child may not be getting enough rest include crankiness or lethargy during the day, falling asleep in the car, and being hard to wake up. If your child is hyper at bedtime or tired before it's time to go to bed, that's another clue his sleep schedule may not be consistent enough.To help your child get enough sleep:Establish a consistent daily sleep schedule and stick to it.Have a regular bedtime routine, which signals to your child's body that it's time to wind down. This might include giving him a bath, reading a bedtime story, or singing softly while tucking him in.Make sure your child's room is dark and quiet so it's conducive to sleep. Keep the TV, video games, and other electronic devices out of his room.Don't roughhouse before bedtime because this is stimulating instead of calming.Keep your usual bedtime schedule and routine on weekends and vacations. The occasional variation won't cause long-term disruptions, but erratic bedtimes can lead to poor sleep habits and sleep deprivation.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2010. A lullaby for good health.

The connection between sleep and growth (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-connection-between-sleep-and-growth-ages-5-to-8_3658990.bc,"Getting enough sleep is important for a young child for many reasons, from restoring energy to building brain connections  not to mention giving Mom and Dad a needed break. But science is showing that sleep also fuels physical growth.The science of growingGrowth is a complex process that requires several hormones to stimulate various biological events in the blood, organs, muscles, and bones.A protein hormone secreted by the pituitary gland called growth hormone (or ""human growth hormone"") is a key player in these events. Several factors affect its production, including nutrition, stress, and exercise. In young children, though, the most important factor is sleep.Growth hormone is released throughout the day. But for kids, the most intense period of release is shortly after the beginning of deep sleep.How much sleep do they need?Kindergartners need about 10 to 12 1/2 hours of sleep per night (with naps declining and eventually disappearing around age 5), and older elementary age kids need 9 1/2 to 11 1/2 hours a night. Sleep needs are somewhat individual, with some kids requiring slightly less or more than their peers.Without adequate sleep, growth problems  mainly slowed or stunted growth  can result. Growth hormone production can also be disrupted in kids with certain physical sleep problems, such as obstructive sleep apnea.More than your child's height can be affected by a shortage of sleep. Some kids fail to produce enough growth hormone naturally, and a lack of sleep makes the problem worse. It can lead to a condition known as growth hormone deficiency that can affect heart or lung strength or immune system function. (It's treatable with a supplementary hormone.)Kids who don't get enough sleep show other changes in the levels of hormones circulating in their body, too. Hormones that regulate hunger and appetite can be affected, causing a child to overeat and have a preference for high-calorie carbs. What's more, a shortage of sleep can affect the way the body metabolizes these foods, triggering insulin resistance, which is linked to type 2 diabetes.A lack of sleep at night can also affect motor skills and concentration during the day, leading to more accidents and behavioral problems, and poor performance at school.Ensuring a good night's sleepMost kids need more sleep than their parents think.Signs that your child may not be getting enough rest include crankiness or lethargy by day, difficulty concentrating in school or failing grades, and being hard to wake up in the morning.To help your child get plenty of zzz's:Establish a consistent bedtime. School-age children should be in bed by 8 to 9 p.m. (earlier for the youngest grades and kids who need a lot of sleep).Set up a good bedtime routine, which helps signal to your child's body that it's time to wind down. This might include giving him a bath or a snack, reading a bedtime story, and talking or singing to him softly while tucking him in.Make sure your child's room is conducive to sleep. It should be dark and quiet.Don't keep a TV and computer in your child's room.Avoid stimulating activity before bedtime.Stick to the same timetable and routines for bedtime on weekends and vacations that you follow during the week. A variation once in a while won't cause long-term disruptions, but erratic bedtimes can lead to poor sleep habits and sleep deprivation."
Where to get help with preemie development delays,https://www.babycenter.com/0_where-to-get-help-with-preemie-development-delays_10300026.bc,"Babies who have spent a lot of time in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) can be at risk for delays in:Speech and languageCognitive skills (thinking, learning, and reasoning)Motor skills (moving with a purpose)The earlier these delays are identified and treated, the more likely your child will be able to reach his potential later in life. In the United States, parents can contact state and local programs for help.Early intervention programsChildren at risk of developmental delays are often referred to an early intervention program. States are required to:Find and evaluate infants and toddlers who are at risk for, or who have, developmental delays or disabilitiesProvide support services to these childrenIn most states, all NICU graduates are eligible for evaluationYour child will receive a diagnostic evaluation. The goal is to determine your child's strengths and any areas that can be improved. Depending on your child's needs, the evaluation may include healthcare providers in one or more of these fields:MedicineNutritionPsychologySocial workEducationHearingVisionSpeech and languagePhysical therapyOccupational therapyIf the evaluation finds a delay or potential for delay, your baby may qualify for services. The level of delay required to qualify for services varies from state to state. If your child is eligible for servicesAn Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) is created to meet the needs of your child and family. Your child may receive services at home or elsewhere, depending on what he needs.Learn about the different therapies available to help premature babies develop.In an early intervention program, the family and the service providers work together. The goal is to give the child the best possible start in life.Although it may be hard, try to be positive about a referral to these services. A referral is not a reflection on you or your parenting skills. By using the services, you are being a good parent. You are giving your baby the best chance to get a good start in school and in life.Once your child turns 3 years old, your local school district is responsible for providing services to him. If you think your child might need special help, call your local school district and ask for an evaluation.See BabyCenter's information onbaby development delays, including warning signs of a delay incommunication or languageorphysical development."
Common tests for babies in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU),https://www.babycenter.com/0_common-tests-for-babies-in-the-neonatal-intensive-care-unit_10300040.bc,"Your baby will have a number of different tests during his stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). These tests help determine what your baby's problems may be and how they should be treated. Tests also monitor his progress.Your baby's doctor will tell you what tests are recommended and inform you of the results. If your baby needs a major test, the doctor will ask you to sign a consent form before the test is done.These are some of the tests done in the NICU. Your baby may need additional specialized tests, depending on his medical condition.Blood testsThese are among the most frequent procedures done in the NICU. Blood tests provide crucial information on how your baby is doing. They alert doctors to potential problems before they become more serious. Your baby may need blood tests to:Check if he is anemic or if his bilirubin level is too high. Bilirubin forms when red blood cells break down.Jaundice results when the liver can't remove bilirubin from the blood.See if your baby has low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), a salt or water imbalance, or nutritional needs (such as problems with protein or liver and kidney function). These can all cause problems if not corrected.Determine whether your baby has an infection and which antibiotic should be used to treat it.Measure the levels of blood gases (oxygen and carbon dioxide). Ifyour baby is very sick, he may need blood tests several times an hour to monitor these levels. This type of blood test may be done on a blood sample taken from an artery because arteries carry oxygen to all parts of the body. The blood sample can be taken from an artery in the wrist or foot, or through the umbilical catheter if a baby has one in place.Yourbaby may have a blood test to check blood gases soon after he's admitted to the NICU to see whether he needs additional oxygen or mechanical ventilation. This test is repeated often to see whether a baby is getting enough oxygen or if the level needs to be adjusted.Computed tomography (CAT or CT scan)A CT scan is an advanced form of imaging that can often produce a more precise image of tissue than an X-ray or ultrasound examination. It focuses a beam of energy on the tissue the doctor wants to see and uses computers to create a two-dimensional image. Your baby will need to be taken to the radiology department and possibly sedated (so he doesn't move) while having this test.EchocardiogramThis is a specialized form of ultrasound examination used to study the heart. It can detect structural problems (heart defects) and problems with how the heart works. Hearing testPremature and other sick babies are at increased risk for hearing problems. Before your baby goes home, he'll probably have a type of hearing test called a ""brainstem auditory evoked response test.""A tiny earphone will be placed in his ear to deliver sound. Small sensors, which are taped to a baby's head, will relay information to a machine that measures the electrical activity in his brain in response to sound.Your baby's doctor will discuss the results of the hearing test with you, including whether any follow-up care will be necessary. If your baby responds normally, he probably has normal hearing. It's important to detecthearing problemsearly in order to prevent speech and language problems.Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)Like a CT scan, an MRI can produce a very detailed picture of something that may be difficult to see on an X-ray or ultrasound. The MRI gives a more detailed view than a CT scan, using powerful magnets and computers to create an image.This test is painless and safe for babies. There are no X-rays involved.Your baby will be moved to the radiology department for this test and may have to be sedated.Newborn screening testAlso calleda PKU or NBS test, this is performed by pricking a baby's heel to obtain a few drops of blood on a filter paper. It tests babies forserious hereditary disorders. Most states screen for more than 20 conditions.New technologies have made it possible totest for many disordersat one time.Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) examinationBabies who are bornat or before 30 weeks gestationor weigh less than 1,500 grams (3 1/3 pounds) usually have this test.A pediatric eye doctor (ophthalmologist) examinesyour baby's eyes with a special scope (ophthalmoscope). Before the examination, the doctor places drops in the baby's eyes so the doctor can see his retina and determine whether the blood vessels are developing normally.If your baby has any signs of ROP, the doctor will let you know if treatment is necessary.UltrasoundUltrasound takes a picture of a baby's organs using sound waves rather than X-rays. A small handheld device called a transducer is rubbed back and forth over the area that the doctor wants to see.An ultrasound examination is painless and done at the baby's incubator. It often is done to determine whether a baby has any bleeding in the brain. A head ultrasound or ""head sonogram"" is the routine test to diagnose bleeding in the brain.Urine testsLike blood tests, urine tests can tell a great deal about a baby's overall condition. Urine tests can help determine how well the kidneys are functioning and whetheryour baby has aninfection.WeighingYour baby is weighed soon after delivery, then at least once a day while he's in the NICU. Don't be alarmed if your baby loses some weight in the first days or weeks after birth. This is normal, especially for very small babies. When a premature baby starts gaining weight at a steady rate, it's an encouraging sign that he's doing well.X-raysX-rays provide pictures ofyour baby's lungs and other internal organs. These pictures help your baby's doctor plan his treatment and monitor his progress.If he has serious breathing problems, your baby may receive several lung X-rays each day. He'll be exposed to a little radiation from these X-rays, but the amount is so low it shouldn't affectyour baby'shealth now or in the future.Yourbaby won't need to be moved to the radiology department for this test. It's done right at his incubator.Video: Preemies in the NICUSeewhat happens in the neonatal intensive care unitand how the littlest babies are treated.

Call in the pros for breastfeeding woesMany new moms have trouble breastfeeding, especially in the first few weeks and when they return to work. But before you give up, ask for help from a pro  and we don't mean a doctor.""Pediatric offices often don't offer much lactation support,"" says pediatrician Alanna Levine. ""But if you're having problems with pumping or with your milksupply, lactation consultants have lots of tricks and techniques you can try."" Often there's a simple fix. A good place to start is to ask a fellow mom who has had breastfeeding problems or used a lactation consultant, or to check out your local chapter of La Leche League.If you're able to hang in there for at least four months, it makes big health differencefor your baby. ""Breastfeeding for one month may offer some benefit,"" says Nancy Krebs, a pediatrician and nutrition specialist, ""but the studies that show reductions in ear infections, diarrhea, and so on, are for babies who were breastfed exclusively (or close to it) for the first four months.""How to get a comfy attachment for breastfeeding Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:01Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:01Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videos2. Introduce juice after six months, if at all""Juice isn't necessary, especially in the first year,"" says pediatrician Sindhu Philip. ""Breast milk, formula, and water contain all the nutrients your baby needs. Plus, infants can develop a preference for sweets if they're introduced to juices and sugary foods early.""Philip recommends holding off until at least 6 and preferably 9 months of age, then talking to your baby's doctor first. If you do give your baby juice, serve it in a sippy cup rather than a bottle, so your baby gets a few sips rather than a constant infusion.To prevent tooth decay, don't let your baby nurse the sippy cup too long, and don't offer it before bedtime. Serve only pasteurized, 100 percent fruit juice rather than ""fruit drinks"" that may be loaded with additional sugar and additives.The American Academy of Pediatrics stresses the benefit of fresh fruit over juice, but says if you must give your child juice, limit it to 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup for children 1 to 6 years old.3. Don't get ahead of your baby's eating skillsIn their enthusiasm about introducing their baby to the wide world of solid foods, some parents unknowingly push the limits on what their child is developmentally ready to handle. ""A person's windpipe is about the width of their pinky finger,"" says pediatrician Jennifer Shu. ""Anything that's too big  especially if it's hard or slippery  can get stuck. Babies can even choke on Cheerios if they don't have teeth and aren't gumming yet.""Other potential hazardsshe often sees parents feeding babies: Whole grapes, carrot chunks or sticks, and peanut butter. Shu recommends waiting until your baby's molars come in before you offer anything other than soft foods that are chopped small or break apart easily.4. Start brushing baby teeth as soon as they emergeMany parents like to tell themselves that baby teethare going to fall out anyway, so why bother? But baby teeth serve as placeholders for permanent teeth, so you want to keep them around until they've served their purpose. You also want to spare your baby from dental work you might think only adults have to suffer through. ""I've seen plenty of babies who had to have root canals because of decay,"" says Shu. Also, sometimes decay can spread from a baby tooth into the permanent tooth behind it.""Start dental hygiene as soon as you see teeth, or even before  you can wipe your baby's gums with a washcloth before bed to get you both in the habit of getting your baby's mouth clean before going to sleep.""5. Put your friends and family on the lookout for postpartum depressionWhile most women  as many as 80 percent  go through the short-lived ""baby blues,"" about 10 to 20 percent get postpartum depression, or PPD. PPD is full-blown, clinical depression and, left untreated, it can have major consequences for babies as well as moms. Studies show that PPD interferes with mother-baby bonding, and babies born to moms with PPD are more likely to cry frequently, suffer delays in language development, and have behavior problems later on.PPD can occur anytime within the first year of giving birth, says Levine. Because women with PPD often don't realize they're depressed, she advises putting your friends, family, and partner on the lookout for the warning signs: Feeling sad and uninterested in life, having problems eating or sleeping (or sleeping too much), withdrawing from friends and family, feeling worthless, having thoughts of wanting to harm your baby, or wishing your baby wasn't there.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012a.

Top 5 things doctors wish you'd do for your grade-schooler,https://www.babycenter.com/0_top-5-things-doctors-wish-youd-do-for-your-grade-schooler_10319217.bc,"1. Keep TVs and computers out of the bedroomPlacing all screens in the house in a common area helps you keep an eye on what, and how much, your child is watching. Time spent in front of the TV or computer, or playing video games, should be no more than two hours a day.And stopping all movies and games at least half an hour before bedtime will help your child fall asleepand stay asleep all night, says pediatrician Sindhu Philip. Watching TV at bedtime, especially in the bedroom, is one of the biggest disruptors of children's sleep, because it's hard for the brain to switch instantly from stimulation to relaxation.2. Establish safety basicsAt this age kids are spending more time away from their parents. ""Big kids should memorize their phone number and address, and they should know that if they get lost they should go to a police officer and ask for help,"" says pediatrician Alanna Levine.They should also know not to talk to a stranger, even if the person asks them to help look for a lost puppy or do something fun. Set up a code word that only you and your child know and make your child promise not to tell it to anyone. Then instruct him never to go with anyone who doesn't know that code word. It helps them learn these rules if you play through the different scenarios with them.3. Don't ditch the booster too soonMany parents rush their children out of a car booster seat too early. The booster's safety advantage lasts longer than most parents think. Most kids are ready to graduate from a booster only when they reach a height of 4 feet 9 inches and are between the ages 8 to 12, which may be different than what your state's law suggests as a minimum.Safe Kids USA has guidelines to help you determine when your child is ready to leave the booster seat behind.4. Make sure kids have free time""There's a middle ground between pushing your kids too hard and having no expectations,"" says pediatrician Joseph Kahn. Pediatricians say many of their patients lean toward the former, with back-to-back sports, music lessons, and other activities. ""Unstructured play is important for children,"" says Kahn. ""If every moment of their lives is spent in a class or activity directed by an adult, they are always following guidelines set by someone else. They don't have the chance to develop self-direction and creativity.""The hyperscheduled lifestyle has another downside  it isn't conducive to sitting down to healthy meals prepared at home. ""If you have your child in so many activities that he's eating fast food in the van, that's misplaced priorities,"" says Nancy Krebs, a pediatrician and nutrition specialist.5. Take five minutes a day to really connect""Sit down for five minutes a day and give your child your undivided attention  talk about what he wants to talk about,"" says pediatrician Anita Chandra. Right after school is usually not the best time  kids are too wiped out. But later, after dinner and homework are done, ask a few specific and nonjudgmental questions to generate conversation: Did you learn anything cool today? Who did you play with at recess? Children grow up very fast. It's a habit of connection you'll be glad to have when your child hits the preteen years.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2010.

Adventurous first foods for babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_adventurous-first-foods-for-babies_10320503.bc,"Baby food doesn't have to be bland to be healthy. Infant cereal, banana puree, and mashed carrots are perfectly fine, but babies can enjoy a much wider range of flavors. Exposure to different healthy foods now may guard against later fixations on ""kid foods""  crackers, pasta, sweet drinks  that aren't particularly good for them.Here are some ideas to help you escape the baby food rut. Even if some of these options aren't your personal favorites, your baby might love them  so try not let your own tastes get in the way of what you serve up at this stage. And of course, depending on your baby's chewing and swallowing skills, you can chop, grind, or puree them as needed.(Note: The old advice about waiting until age 1 or later to introduce allergenic foods no longer applies to most babies, but it's still a good idea to introduce new foods gradually. Feed your baby one new food at a time, waiting at least three days between new items. That way if there is an allergic reaction, you'll be able to tell what's causing it.)Sour fruitsSurprisingly, many kids love sour foods, says Matthew Amster-Burton, food writer and author of Hungry Monkey: A Food-Loving Father's Quest to Raise an Adventurous Eater.Try serving your baby some pureed sour cherries (after removing the pits, of course) or cut the cherries into chunks for older babies. You can also try plums, which are pleasingly tart. Serve them plain or in a crumble.5 tips to develop healthy eating habits Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:05Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:05Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosStewed meat""Stewed meat is the ideal baby food,"" says Amster-Burton. ""It's easy, it tastes even better when it's a day old, and you can cook it in a dozen different ways. For example, you can do a Chinese beef stew with soy sauce and ginger, or a Mexican beef stew with chiles.""Babies eating chiles? Yep. Babies in other parts of the world eat and enjoy spicy food, and Amster-Burton's own daughter has loved Mexican beef stew since she was 8 months old. He recommends using the milder chile varieties, such as Anaheims and poblanos (available in most supermarkets), rather than super-hot types, such as habaneros and jalapenos, that can irritate the skin and mouth.If you're ready to branch out from beef, Amster-Burton recommends carnitas (stewed pork shoulder). ""Cook the pork shoulder with a little lime juice or orange juice until the liquid is gone and the meat is soft. It's great for tacos,"" he says.Cruciferous veggiesGreen beans and sweet potatoes are considered ideal baby foods, but turnips and cauliflower? Not so much. That's a shame, because cruciferous vegetables  which also include broccoli, bok choy, kale, cabbage, and brussels sprouts  are packed to the brim with important nutrients. And just because they aren't your typical baby food doesn't mean babies don't smack their lips over them.""My son liked mashed turnips, which really surprised me,"" says dietitian Jill Nussinow of Santa Rosa, California.

A report released by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2008 says there's no evidence that withholding fish and other common allergenic foods from babies in the first year prevents allergies.The AAP says it's fine to feed these foods to babies 4 to 6 months of age, as long as they don't show signs of an allergy (such as eczema) to food or anything else. If your baby has a strong family history of asthma or allergies, it may still be safe to introduce allergenic foods, but check with the doctor first.""Most parents wouldn't think about giving their baby salmon. Yet it is such a great source of DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid,"" says Bridget Swinney, a registered dietitian and author of Baby Bites, a book about feeding babies and toddlers.Guide to Firsts: Solid foodOur checklist helps you get ready to feed your baby.""I'd simmer the fish with a little fresh or dried dill, or cilantro,"" Swinney says. She suggests combining the herbs with 1/2 cup water, broth, or milk and herbs and heating to a boil. Add 4 ounces of boneless, skinless salmon and reduce heat to simmer. Cook 3 to 4 minutes or until fish flakes easily. Chop fish finely or puree with 1 or 2 tablespoons of the cooking liquid.Whole grainsWhole grains such as quinoa and millet expose your baby to a whole new world of food textures, which is important for oral development, says Seattle pediatrician Susanna Block. ""The textural variety of different grains helps babies learn to use their mouths and tongues, which can really help them with speech,"" she explains.Many grains taste better with a little something extra  and your baby can handle it. So if a recipe calls for seasoning, don't feel you have to ""bland it down."" A few chopped onions could transform wheat berries or bulgur into your baby's all-time favorite snack.""I cooked quinoa in vegetable broth for extra flavor and served it with cooked, cubed butternut squash. I had a very happy baby!"" says dietitian Karin Hosenfeld of North Dallas Nutrition."
Vitamin A in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-a-in-your-childs-diet_10324693.bc,"Vitamin A is crucial for children's good health and development. Read on to find out how much vitamin A your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Why vitamin A is importantVitamin A plays an important role in vision and bone growth and helps protect the body from infections. Vitamin A also promotes the health and growth of cells and tissues in the body, particularly those in the hair, nails, and skin.How much vitamin A does my child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 1,000 international units (IU), or 300 micrograms (mcg) retinol activity equivalents (RAE), of vitamin A per dayAge 4 years and up: 1,333 IU, or 400 mcg RAE per dayYour child doesn't have to get enough vitamin A every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of vitamin AColorful fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamin A. Here are some of the best sources:1/2 cup carrot juice: 22,567 IU1/4 cup cooked sweet potato: 12,907 IUone raw carrot (7 1/2 inches): 8,666 IU1/4 cup cooked carrots: 6,709 IU1/4 cup cooked spinach: 5,729 IU1/4 cup butternut squash: 5,717 IU1/4 cup cooked kale: 4,979 IU1/2 cup canned vegetable soup: 2,910 IU1/4 cup cantaloupe: 1,352 IU1/4 cup apricots, packed in juice: 1,031 IU1/4 cup red bell pepper: 720 IU1/4 cup raw spinach: 703 IU1/4 cup sliced mango: 631 IU1/2 cup fortified instant oatmeal, prepared with water: 626 IU1/4 cup cooked broccoli: 603 IU1/4 cup cooked frozen peas: 525 IU1/2 cup tomato juice: 546 IU1/2 cup fortified milk: 250 IU1/4 cup canned peaches, packed in juice: 236 IU1/2 large egg, scrambled: 160 IU1/2 ounce cheddar cheese: 142 IU1/4 cup green bell pepper: 137 IU1/4 cup fresh peaches: 125 IU1/4 cup papaya: 83 IUThe amount of vitamin A in a food varies somewhat, depending on the size of the fruit or vegetable.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts of food shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much vitamin A?Yes. Normally, the body has to convert vitamin A from its inactive form to its active form, so the body can use it. Usually an excess of vitamin A is from taking supplements that already contain high levels of the active form of the vitamin.It's also possible to get too much of the active form of vitamin A from animal sources, like liver and milk. For example, beef liver contains 21,566 IU per slice.By contrast, it's nearly impossible to overdose by getting an abundance of carotenoids, the orange and yellow pigments in carrots and other vegetables and fruits. When you eat vitamin A from these nonanimal sources, the body converts only what it needs from carotenoids to the active form of vitamin A. What will most likely happen if you go on a carrot binge is that your skin will turn yellow-orange (and that effect disappears once you go back to eating a balanced diet).How much vitamin A is too much?Children ages 1 to 3 should not get more than 2,000 IU (600 mcg RAE) a day. Children ages 4 to 8 should not get more than 3,000 IU (900 mcg RAE).Those are the maximum amounts considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine. Don't give your child a vitamin supplement that contains more than the recommended amounts of vitamin A that your child needs every day.Too much of the active form of vitamin A can cause nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, and lack of muscle coordination. Long-term effects include osteoporosis, liver problems, and disorders of the central nervous system.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for children"

Note that nuts and seeds are choking hazards for very young children, and nut butters should be spread thinly for the same reason. Other foods (like beans) should be mashed.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much magnesium?From supplements, yes. Getting too much magnesium from diet alone is highly unlikely, but it is possible to overload on magnesium in dietary supplements.Taking too much magnesium in supplement form can cause problems like diarrhea and stomach cramps. In very large doses, magnesium can be toxic.The tolerable upper intake level for magnesium in supplement form is 65 mg per day for children ages 1 to 3, and 110 mg per day for children ages 4 to 8. That's the maximum amount of magnesium added to a normal daily diet considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine.There is no upper intake level of magnesium you get from food.Show sources Hide sources IOM. 1997.

Read on to find out how much vitamin C your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Why vitamin C is importantVitamin C helps form and repair red blood cells, bones, and tissues. It helps your child's gums stay healthy and strengthens your child's blood vessels, minimizing bruising from falls and scrapes. In addition, vitamin C helps cuts and wounds heal, boosts the immune system, and keeps infections at bay. And it helps the body absorb iron from food sources.How much vitamin C does my child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 15 milligrams (mg) dailyAges 4 to 8: 25 mg dailyThis vitamin is available in so many foods that deficiencies are extremely rare. Children who are very picky eaters and don't eat a lot of fruits and vegetables may not get enough vitamin C. Also, children exposed to secondhand smoke need more vitamin C to repair cell damage from cigarettes.If you're concerned that your child doesn't get enough vitamin C, ask your child's doctor whether you need to boost your child's intake.Your child doesn't have to get enough vitamin C every day.

However, megadoses can still cause nausea, diarrhea, kidney stones, and gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining).Children ages 1 to 3 should not get more than 400 mg of vitamin C a day. Children ages 4 to 8 should not get more than 650 mg a day.Those are the maximum amounts considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine.

Secrets to raising smart kids: Feed the brain,https://www.babycenter.com/0_secrets-to-raising-smart-kids-feed-the-brain_10336239.bc,"Breakfast of championsWe've always heard that breakfast is the most important meal of the day, but it's especially true when it comes to your child's developing brain. Studies have shown that children who eat breakfast perform better in attention and memory tests than those who don't.Why? Food absorbed by our bodies is converted to glucose that powers the body  and the brain. Your child wakes up with an empty tank that needs to be refueled. ""Your child's brain needs glucose to function well. Without it, she may have difficulty understanding new information and won't remember things as well,"" says Terrill Bravender, chief of adolescent medicine at Nationwide Children's Hospital, and professor of clinical pediatrics at the Ohio State University College of Medicine.Research bears this out. Harvard Medical School psychologist J. Michael Murphy and his colleagues at Massachusetts General Hospital re-analyzed the data of a USDA school breakfast pilot project that examined the impact of a universal free breakfast program of 4,000 elementary school students. Murphys analysis found that regular breakfast skipping was associated with poorer school attendance and tardiness, less verbal fluency, and more parent- and teacher-related behavior problems.Diane Pratt-Heavner, a spokesperson for the School Nutrition Association, agrees with Murphy. ""I know principals who keep snacks in their drawers for children with discipline problems. Many times, those kids never ate breakfast,"" she says.But don't pull out the sugary cereals just yet. The type of food a child eats is just as important as whether she eats at all. Highly sweetened breakfast cereals can give kids a short-lived sugar high, resulting in the inevitable crash.Protein- and fiber-rich breakfasts, on the other hand, give the brain sustained go-power. In a study published in the journal Physiology and Behavior, children who ate oatmeal for breakfast performed 20 percent better on a map-memorization test than their sugary-cereal-munching counterparts.""Eating something with complex carbs and protein gives your child's brain a constant, slow infusion of glucose for better brain function,"" says Bravender. That said, Bravender stresses that when it comes to breakfast something is better than nothing, so make sure your child gets a morning meal.What you can doHere are some great ideas for quick and easy brain-boosting breakfasts that kids love.Read the next secret to raising smart kids."

We might also go to a museum or out to have dim sum [Chinese dumplings and other small dishes]. It's our explore-and-have-fun time.4:00 to 4:30 p.m.Quiet time. The kids can listen to an audio book and do Legos or make art. Weather permitting, they play in the backyard. I catch up on email or get dinner started. Sometimes it's the first chance I've had to sit down all day.Quiet time works best when I put my twins in different rooms. Audio books have been amazing, too. They can sit quietly and listen to stories on the iPod for half an hour.4:30 to 5:15 p.m.Kids help me make dinner or I put them in front of a video while I do it.5:15 p.m.Dad is home. He plays (usually wrestling) with them while I finish dinner or futz around.Dinner is complicated in our house because our kids are picky, and in different ways. I try to make sure they get all the nutrition they need, but my son won't eat anything I make. I end up serving them lots of cut-up tofu, cut-up fruit, carrot sticks, plain pasta, cheese, and bread.

About twice a week we have ""fend"" nights when the kids eat something really simple like quesadillas and we eat whatever we can find: leftovers, frozen entrees, or crackers and cheese.6:15 or 6:30 p.m.Bath time. One parent supervises the bath and straightens the kids' room (the bathroom is right next to the bedroom, so we can still see them in the tub) while the other cleans up after dinner.6:30 or 6:45 p.m.Jammies on, teeth brushed.6:45 to 7:15 p.m.We read books aloud. Sometimes we all sit together to do this.

As food enters the small intestine from the stomach, the gallbladder receives a signal to start contracting and release bile into the intestine.Bile is composed of water, bile salts, and cholesterol, among other things. If the bile contains too much cholesterol and not enough bile salts, or the gallbladder doesn't empty properly, the gallbladder can form deposits, known as stones or gallstones. These stones are one form of gallbladder disease, but you can have stones and not notice any symptoms.The term ""gallbladder disease"" covers inflammation, infection, stones, and blockage of the gallbladder.What is biliary colic?Biliary colic is the result of a blockage in the ducts of the gallbladder. If the bile is unable to exit the gallbladder, perhaps because of a gallstone, it can lead to inflammation or infection. And since the bile isn't entering the small intestine, the fat in the diet doesn't get broken down during digestion, and this can cause pain in the upper abdomen and back, as well as nausea and vomiting.Biliary colic creates a sharp pain in the upper part of the abdomen that appears one to two hours after a meal that's high in fat. (Because dinner is usually the heaviest meal, the pain is more likely to occur at night.) The pain can last from a few minutes to several hours.Some people also have pain between the shoulder blades or underneath the right shoulder. In addition to pain and nausea, biliary colic can cause gas, abdominal bloating, sweating, chills, or fever.How does pregnancy affect the gallbladder?Pregnancy hormones, particularly progesterone, cause muscular tissue throughout the body to relax, and this affects the gallbladder as well. The release of bile slows, and bile that doesn't get released can lead to the development of gallstones. Pregnant women who already have gallstones run a higher risk that these stones will block the release of the bile.The problem in detecting the beginning of gallbladder disease during pregnancy is that the symptoms may be confused with morning sickness. However, if symptoms persist beyond the first trimester, or if you or your doctor suspects gallbladder-related problems, your doctor will likely recommend an ultrasound. Ultrasound is the most effective way to diagnose a gallbladder condition.Of course, if you've had gallbladder problems before, let your doctor know so he can monitor you during pregnancy and prevent the disease from getting worse.Am I at risk for gallbladder disease?Women are far more likely to develop gallbladder disease than men are. You're more likely to develop gallbladder disease if you have a family history of the disease, are overweight (even if only moderately), have a high fat or high cholesterol diet, have diabetes, or are of Mexican or Native American origin.Gallbladder disease used to be known as an older woman's affliction. But with more obesity among younger women, more younger women are being diagnosed with gallbladder disease.Symptoms of gallbladder disease are more common in the third trimester or after delivery, but those at higher risk can develop the symptoms earlier in pregnancy.Will gallbladder disease affect my baby?Deposits or stones have no direct effect on your baby. However, your baby could be affected by the consequences of the disease. For instance, if you develop an infection, inflammation, or nausea and vomiting, these conditions can hinder your ability to nourish yourself and pass along adequate nutrition to your developing baby.How is gallbladder disease treated during pregnancy?In general, the goal of treatment during pregnancy is to reduce the symptoms and complications, and then treat the disease itself after pregnancy.The first step in treating an inflamed gallbladder is to change your diet and eat fewer fatty foods. This means that the gallbladder will have to work less. For many women this step alone may be enough to relieve the symptoms. Regular exercise can also be helpful.If your doctor prescribes a drug for a gallbladder problem and it doesn't provide adequate relief, he'll evaluate the effects of the disease and the risks of surgery. Given the risks, any surgery during pregnancy is generally avoided. But if the inflammation is severe, if there's an infection, or if the colic is acute, an operation may be necessary to prevent more serious complications.If you need gallbladder surgery, it will probably be done laparoscopically. The surgeon makes two small abdominal incisions, inserting surgical instruments and a laparoscope. The laparoscope has a tiny camera that transmits a picture of the organs to a video monitor.The gallbladder can then be removed without having to create a large incision. This means less pain and an easier recovery.Can I develop gallbladder problems after pregnancy?It's not uncommon for gallbladder disease symptoms to appear two to four months after delivery. This may be because pregnancy hormones aggravated the problem during the preceding nine months. Changes in your hormone levels after delivery may also be the culprit.Gallbladder problems may also result from rapid weight loss after delivery. When you burn fat quickly, extra cholesterol accumulates in the bile, which can lead to gallstones.To reduce your risk of developing gallstones after pregnancy, eat a high-fiber diet that includes plenty of fruit, vegetables, and whole grains. Try to keep your postpartum weight loss to no more than 2 pounds a week. And get plenty of exercise.If you had gallbladder disease that was controlled during pregnancy and no surgery was required, it's important to have a follow-up evaluation. Symptoms can occur in the postpartum period or later in life, so have an evaluation when you're not in pain. Your doctor may recommend that you have the gallbladder removed to avoid an emergency situation later.Lourdes Alcaiz is the author of Waiting for Beb: A Pregnancy Guide for Latinas."
4 key nutrients you may be missing,https://www.babycenter.com/0_4-key-nutrients-you-may-be-missing_10352387.bc,"In a perfect world, we'd get all the nutrients we need from well-balanced home-cooked meals. Unfortunately, with today's jam-packed schedules and on-the-go dining, we're likely to fall short on critical nutrients.Revamp your diet to make sure you include the following key nutrients and you'll not only function better, you'll help stave off disease and may even extend your life.Omega-3sResearch shows that consuming a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the risk of heart disease. Omega-3s DHA and EPA do this by helping prevent irregular heartbeats, reducing plaque buildup and inflammation in the arteries, and keeping blood sugar levels in check.Need more reasons to load up on omega-3s? Researchers from the National Institutes of Health report that they're more effective at combating depression than commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs.Where to find them:Fatty fish like salmon, trout, and sardines. (Some plant foods contain the omega-3 ALA, but this fatty acid hasn't been proven to provide the health benefits of DHA and EPA.) Eating just one or two servings of fatty fish a week can slash your risk of dying from heart disease by 36 percent. Not into fish? Take a supplement.Vitamin DFor years, scientists thought vitamin D's only role was to enhance the absorption of calcium from food. New research shows that vitamin D can reduce chronic pain, ease PMS, guard against heart disease, and even ward off cancer.Trouble is, most of us don't get enough vitamin D to maintain bone health, let alone reach the levels that protect against chronic disease. People used to get a lot of vitamin D from sunlight. Nowadays we protect ourselves from the sun, and our vitamin D levels have declined as a result. What's more, experts say the current daily recommendation of 400 IU is too low, and that most Americans need a minimum of 1,000 IU of vitamin D every day, especially in the absence of sunlight.Where to find it:It may be difficult to get all of the vitamin D you need by loading up on vitamin D-rich foods like salmon and fortified milk and cereal. To get the recommended 1,000 IU, look for supplements that contain vitamin D (cholecalciferol), an active form that's more effective than its vitamin D2 counterpart.FiberDietary fiber fills you up without weighing you down, helps keep blood sugar levels in check, and helps prevent health problems ranging from cancer to stroke. Even though the nutrient is widely available in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, most Americans get very little. Our average intake is a paltry 14 grams per day, compared to the recommended 25 to 35 grams.""People are spending less money at the supermarket and more money at fast food joints that don't serve high-fiber meals,"" says Milton Stokes, research assistant at the University of Connecticut and founder of One Source Nutrition in Stamford. ""Not only does this increase the chance of constipation  an ailment that affects more than 4 million Americans  it also can lead to weight gain.""Where to find it:Fortunately, fiber is easy to find. Oatmeal, beans, barley, and most fruits and vegetables (especially apples, berries, and broccoli) are chock full of the stuff. If you're adding fiber to your diet, make sure to boost your water intake, too. A sudden increase in fiber consumption without water can cause bloating, constipation, and other tummy troubles.CalciumWhile the ""Got milk?"" campaign has done an excellent job of reminding us that calcium-rich foods promote strong bones, it fails to mention the many other roles calcium has. In fact, getting enough calcium can help prevent diseases ranging from diabetes and cancer to hypertension and heart disease.""Calcium is important for muscle function, not just bone health,"" says Christine Gerbstadt, national spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. ""The heart is a muscle and it needs calcium, too."" Only 21 percent of adults get the recommended amount of calcium (1,000 mg per day for women 19 to 50, and 1,200 mg for women 51 and over).Where to find it:According to Gerbstadt, two to three servings of dairy every day should meet your needs. Want extra insurance? Consider taking a supplement or choosing calcium-fortified cereals or orange juice."
10 energy-boosting foods,https://www.babycenter.com/0_10-energy-boosting-foods_10352389.bc,"When your energy is low, it's tempting to give in to cravings for caffeine and sugar  anything to help get you through the day. Instead, choose foods that are rich in protein or fiber to give your body the fuel it needs to keep going. Here are ten of our favorites.EggsAt just 78 calories and 6 grams of protein, the egg is a protein powerhouse. And it's loaded with other nutrients as well, especially in the yolks, says Jonny Bowden, author of The 150 Most Effective Ways to Boost Your Energy. ""People avoid the yolk because they're worried about cholesterol, but egg yolks contain choline, which is critical for memory.""OatmealLoaded with stress-reducing B vitamins and soluble fiber, oatmeal is the perfect choice for an energy boost. Dietary fiber fills you up without weighing you down, keeps blood sugar levels in check, and helps prevent the overwhelming desire to snooze come 3 p.m. Add a few nutrient-rich berries on top, and you've got the snack of champions.Apples""Not only are fiber-rich apples an excellent choice for a mid-afternoon snack, they're also disease-fighting powerhouses,"" says Pamela Nisevich, sports nutrition consultant at Swim, Bike, Run, Eat! What's more, apples contain boron, a mineral that helps keep you alert.PumpkinPumpkin is loaded with potassium, which helps your heart and muscles function better, says Bowden. Plus, it's packed with fiber (which helps stabilize blood sugar levels) and vitamin A (which helps keep your immune system strong enough to fight off energy-draining infections). Add canned pumpkin to rice for a quick, healthy risotto.SalmonHow many other foods help protect your heart, boost brainpower, and make you feel happy to boot? Salmon is packed with vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 essential fatty acids which research suggests can boost your mood. Plus, its lower in fat and calories than most other protein sources.PeanutsWhile peanuts are high in calories, they're also more filling than other foods, and they naturally curb your calorie intake throughout the day. A study published in the International Journal of Obesity found that when people consumed 500 calories of peanuts daily for 19 weeks, their resting metabolic rate increased by 11 percent  even without added exercise.Trail Mix""Trail mix is quite possibly the world's perfect energy booster,"" says Nisevich. ""It's packed with enough carbs and protein to get you up the trail or over the mountain."" To avoid added sugar and fat, make your own mix with nutrient-rich dried cranberries or apricots and heart-healthy nuts like pistachios and almonds.LentilsThese quick-cooking legumes are a great source of soluble fiber, which gives you steady, slow-burning energy while stabilizing your blood sugar. That fiber  along with folate and magnesium  also helps protect your heart. Finally, lentils are a healthy source of iron, a nutrient you need more of when you're pregnant or lactating. Serve them with whole grains for a complete protein  meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids.YogurtYogurt boasts higher concentrations of protein, calcium, and vitamin D than milk. Plus many brands of yogurt have live active cultures, which can aid digestion. Try organic or Greek yogurt since it's less likely to be loaded with artificial ingredients, sugar, and preservatives.HummusThis yummy spread is made from chickpeas, sesame seeds, lemon, and olive oil. It's a great source of protein and fiber, as well as iron, vitamin C, and folate. Use it as a dip for carrots, peppers, and whole wheat pita strips."
BabyCenter® Reveals Findings of New Postpartum Depression Study,https://www.babycenter.com/0_babycenter-174-reveals-findings-of-new-postpartum-depression_10399317.bc,"Contact:Nicole Centinaro / Sue MurphyCoyne Public Relations973-588-2000More Than 20 Percent of Moms Experience PPD; 40 Percent Not Seeking HelpDue to Feelings of Embarrassment and Guilt(San Francisco)  November 18, 2014  BabyCenter, the number one pregnancy and parenting digital resource, released today findings from its new postpartum depression (PPD) study. According to the study, more than 20 percent of moms are diagnosed with PPD; however, 40 percent do not seek medical help. They feel they have the strength to get over the feelings without a doctors help (30 percent), they dont think the feelings are serious enough (25 percent), and they experience feelings of embarrassment (24 percent) and guilt (23 percent).This study revealed serious findings that need to be addressed, says Linda Murray, BabyCenter Global Editor in Chief. Depression is dangerous for women and their babies, and untreated depression can become worse and lead to other complications. Depression affects people from all walks of life, but new moms are particularly susceptible given the stress of becoming a parent, lack of sleep, and hormonal changes. We want moms to understand that seeking help for PPD isnt something to be embarrassed or ashamed about; in fact, its one of the most important things they can do for the well-being of their babies.Who is most at risk?Some degree of emotional vulnerability is natural and expected after childbirth, but some women are more likely than others to experience PPD. Risk factors include:Personal or family history of depression or anxietyUnplanned pregnancyUnsupportive spouse or partnerMarital difficultiesFinancial problemsRecent separation or divorceSerious life change such as a big move or loss of a jobSevere premenstrual syndromeObstetric complicationsEarly childhood trauma or a history of abuseFertility strugglesPerfectionist personalitiesIt strikes me as amazing that we see a woman every week during her pregnancy, but once the baby is out and she has to deal with her hormones going wild, sleep deprivation, and a brand-new crying being, we say, Bye! See you in six weeks. This fourth trimester has been completely neglected, says Dr. Alison Stuebe, associate professor of maternal-fetal medicine, University of North Carolina School of Medicine, and a member of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine. In the U.S., there are some pediatricians who manage to check in with Mom at well-baby visits to see if shes coming unraveled, but that's difficult to do in an information-packed 15-minute encounter. The current state of affairs is that Mom is pretty much on her own. We need continuity of care thats integrated, where someone Mom has already met and who knows her, can follow up, whether with a phone call or home visit.The signs and symptoms of PPDMany people equate postpartum depression with feelings of sadness, but symptoms can be much broader and include:Changes in sleep patternsAngerWeepiness or sadness that persists all dayDiminished interest in almost all activities, including sexDifficulty concentratingChange in appetiteAnxietyIntrusive worries or scary thoughtsMoodiness and irritabilityExcessive guiltPanic attacksSuicidal thoughtsTo provide moms with more information concerning whether they should discuss PPD with their physician, BabyCenter created an online quiz based on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression scale.In response to these findings and to lend support to the cause, BabyCenter is working with Katherine Stone, the founder of Postpartum Progress, which raises awareness, fights stigma, and provides peer support to women with maternal mental illness. Stone will blog regularly on BabyCenter to shed additional light on PPD and remind new and expecting moms that there is no shame in feelings of anxiety or depression.The biggest thing for women to know about PPD is that its not one-size-fits-all, says Stone. Some women experience multiple symptoms, while others may only experience one. If you have any feelings indicating something may be amiss, seek help.What can you do?For those experiencing PPD, getting treated as soon as possible is crucial. Some other things to consider:Its not all about the baby: Moms need to remember to take care of themselves, too. Developing proper nutrition, exercise, and sleep habits can go a long way. Mapping out ways to take breaks and find some downtime is also crucial.Talk it out: Two in 3 moms who notice PPD symptoms talk to their partner or spouse. Its important to have honest conversations, especially with a partner and healthcare provider. Joining a support group, finding an online community, counseling, and calling a PPD helpline also help.Returning to work: Those surveyed said returning to work helped reduce their symptoms.I cant stress enough that PPD is treatable, but only if moms ask for help, says psychologist Susan Bartell. It can be hard, but moms dont need to be afraid to seek support during this difficult time. And its important for moms to remember that help comes in many forms ranging from friends who simply fold your laundry to therapy.For more information about PPD, and what new moms can do about it, visit: /postpartum-depression."

BabyCenter® and Stonyfield Team Up for Year-Long Marketing Campaign,https://www.babycenter.com/0_babycenter-174-and-stonyfield-team-up-for-year-long-marketin_10403399.bc,"Contacts:Laura Goldberg  lauragoldberg@gmail.comLaurie Jakobsen  laurie@jaybirdcom.comU.S. Program Will Reach Moms Across Digital Platforms With All Stages of theStonyfield Organic Yogurt Products for Babies and Kids(San Francisco)  February 25, 2015  BabyCenter, the number one pregnancy and parenting web and mobile destination worldwide, and Stonyfield, the worlds leading organic yogurt maker, are working together on an integrated, multi-platform campaign in 2015 to reach U.S. moms as their babies grow with the full line of YoBaby, YoTot, and YoKids organic yogurt products. The first phase is now online, focused on education around an infants nutritional needs, and the campaign will progress throughout the year, moving to the 6-month milestone, first birthday, toddlerhood, and then to preschool and beyond. Points of integration on BabyCenter include video pre-roll, email, branded content, mobile media, as well as new apps and contests that will roll out later in the year.For example, Stonyfield will be integrated into several of BabyCenters milestone opportunities, such as the Half-Birthday Community Party, a monthly virtual event reaching 12,000 to 15,000 moms in the BabyCenter Community, and targeted outreach at four different developmental stages using mobile, app, desktop, and email. Stonyfield messaging will also be aligned with relevant expert content around food and healthy eating, written by BabyCenter editors and supported by industry experts.After more than 30 years of making organic yogurt, 16 of those making yogurt just for babies, Stonyfield has seen the competition for Moms yogurt of choice for her baby steadily increase, and now more than ever she needs information she can trust about that choice. Stonyfield understands that starting a baby on solid foods is one of the most exciting and mystifying times in a familys journey. By partnering with a trusted resource like BabyCenter, they hope to help make things a little easier for Mom by providing information about when to introduce yogurt (as early as 6 months), why choosing whole milk yogurt is important for babys development (pediatricians recommend that about half of a babys calories come from fat during the first two years), and why choosing organic is best for babies and kids as they grow.BabyCenters unique knowledge of moms and their children allows us to bring the right Stonyfield product information to her, just when she needs it, said Pete Lewis, Senior Director of Marketing, Stonyfield. No one else has their reach and the trust of moms, so they were the clear first choice to work with for this campaign around our YoBaby, YoTot, and YoKids brands.Our moms want more information on nutritious, organic, and affordable foods for their babies, so we knew Stonyfield would be a natural fit for the BabyCenter experience, said Julie Michaelson, Vice President of Sales, BabyCenter. We are careful in delivering the right message to moms based on their childs development, and Stonyfields stage-focused line of yogurts supports that perfectly."

Newborn weight gain - what's healthy and what's not,https://www.babycenter.com/0_newborn-weight-gain-whats-healthy-and-whats-not_10414652.bc,"Why does newborn weight gain matter?Tracking your newborn's growth in height and weight over time gives your baby's doctor a good sense of your child's general health.When a baby doesn't gain weight at a healthy rate, she may be diagnosed with a condition called failure to gain weight (or failure to thrive). This usually happens if she isn't eating well or isn't absorbing or using nutrients properly. It could be due to a feeding problem, a gastrointestinal issue, or some other medical condition.Healthcare providers will keep a close eye on your baby's weight gain because good nutrition is crucial for your baby's mental and physical development.While you're still in the hospital, a doctor or nurse will weigh your baby at birth and every 24 hours after birth. Your baby will be weighed again when you come in for your first doctor visits (usually in the first week after you leave the hospital and again when your baby is 10 to 14 days old) and at all your baby's well-child visits during the first year. These measurements are recorded on your baby's growth chart.If your baby is having any health problems, including unexpected weight loss or jaundice, you may have to see the doctor more often in the first few weeks.What is normal weight loss for a newborn in the first days after birth?Most healthy, full-term babies lose between 5 and 10 percent of their birth weight in the first days after birth. Early weight loss happens because babies are born with extra fluid that gets eliminated after birth. This weight loss is normal and not a concern unless a baby loses more than 10 percent of his birth weight.What is normal weight gain for a newborn in the first weeks after birth?Babies usually start to gain weight again five to seven days after birth, and most should be back to (or above) their birth weight by about 2 weeks old. Although most babies follow this trend, about 10 percent of healthy newborns regain their birth weight more slowly over several weeks.Many factors go into a baby's weight gain in those first weeks of life,including how fast your breast milk comes in and how much your baby wants to eat. For example, you may notice your baby wants to eat more often or for longer when she's between 7 and 10 days old. (When a baby wants to eat again soon after a full feeding, it's called ""cluster feeding."")How can I tell if my newborn is gaining enough weight?Most parents don't have a scale suitable for weighing a baby at home, but luckily counting the number of your baby's dirty diapers is another good way to tell that your baby is doing fine:Wet diapers: In the first five days, your newborn may wet only a few diapers each day. After that, expect at least four, but as many as eight, wet diapers daily.Poopy diapers: In the first few days, some babies may poop only once daily. After that, expect your baby to poop at least twice a day. After the first week, your baby will likely poop 10 or more times daily until the end of the first month.It's helpful to track diaper changes in a journal, on BabyCenter's printable baby care log, or with an app on your phone.Find out more ways to tell if your baby is getting enough breast milk or formula.What can I do if my baby loses too much weight after birth or isn't gaining enough?In general, it's a good idea to check in with the doctor if you notice that your baby isn't feeding well or wetting very many diapers. If you're worried about your baby's weight during the first weeks after birth, talk to your child's doctor about:Bringing in your baby regularly for weighingSpecific advice about getting your baby to eat moreWhen to call with concernsIf you want to track your baby's weight for your own peace of mind in between doctor's visits, many lactation and new parent support centers have baby scales and will allow you to stop by and weigh your baby any time.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Diet for gestational diabetes,https://www.babycenter.com/0_diet-for-gestational-diabetes_10415154.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI have gestational diabetes. Do I have to watch what I eat?Yes. Eating well helps all women stay healthy during pregnancy. But if you have gestational diabetes, choosing the right food to eat is even more important. That's because many women with gestational diabetes can manage their condition by following a healthy eating plan, monitoring their blood sugar, and exercising regularly.Keeping your blood sugar stable by eating healthy food and exercising makes it less likely that you'll need medication to control your condition. You and your baby are also less likely to have any complications from your condition.Watching what you eat also helps you gain a healthy amount of weight during pregnancy. If you were overweight before becoming pregnant, your healthcare provider may recommend limiting calories so you don't gain too much as your baby grows.Do I need to monitor carbohydrates?Yes. The amount and type of carbohydrates (natural starches and sugars) in food affects your blood sugar levels. And with gestational diabetes, you'll need to track your carbohydrate intake in particular.Setting a limit on the amount of carbohydrates you eat at each meal is the first step to managing your blood sugar. Your provider is likely to recommend reducing the total amount of carbohydrates to about 40 percent of your daily calories.Try to eat carbohydrates that are high in fiber. Fibrous foods are harder to digest.Whole grains are high in fiber, so choosing brown rice and whole grain bread instead of refined versions (white bread and rice) means that they take longer to digest and release sugar more slowly into your bloodstream. Vegetables, beans, lentils, and chickpeas are also high in fiber and release sugar into your blood slowly.Avoid food and drinks that are high in added sugars, such as candy, cakes, and sodas. If you're craving something sweet, artificial sweeteners such as aspartame (NutraSweet and Equal) and sucralose (Splenda) are fine in moderation.Lean proteins should make up about 20 percent of what you eat each day. Fish, lean meat, and low-fat milk and dairy products are healthy protein choices.The remainder of your calories should come from healthy (unsaturated) fats, such as olive oil. That's about 40 percent of your daily calories.Avoid unhealthy (saturated) fats, such as butter, and trans (hydrogenated) fats, like those found in processed foods. Foods like all-natural peanut butter are high in healthy fat and a good source of protein, but check labels because peanut butter can have trans fat.If all this seems overwhelming, know that you don't have to make these changes on your own. Your provider will give you plenty of information to guide you when making food choices. She can also refer you to a registered dietitian to help with meal planning.How can I keep my blood sugar stable?When you're trying to control gestational diabetes, what you eat isn't the only factor to consider. How and when you eat is important too.The goal is to keep your blood sugar even and avoid the spikes that lead to blood sugar going up. This is even more critical if you do need to take medications to control your diabetes.Having some protein at each meal can help balance blood sugar. For example, eating a small portion of whole grain cooked cereal (like oatmeal) with an egg or yogurt at breakfast can balance your meal and prevent blood sugar spikes. All-natural peanut butter on whole wheat toast is another good option.Have three small meals, plus two to four healthy snacks, every day to keep your blood sugar level stable. Try to space these out evenly so you eat something every two to three hours. Having a snack before bedtime is especially important to keep your blood sugar levels from falling overnight.Repeated blood sugar spikes mean gestational diabetes is uncontrolled, which can lead to health problems for you and your baby.What are low glycemic index foods?The glycemic index (GI) ranks foods that contain carbohydrates based on how quickly they release energy, in the form of glucose, into your blood.Foods with a low glycemic index give a sustained release of energy. Because they take time to digest and turn to glucose gradually, foods low on the glycemic index are less likely to cause spikes in blood sugar and can help to control blood sugar levels.On the other hand, foods high on the glycemic index are digested rapidly and turn to glucose more quickly. This can make your blood sugar rise soon after meals.Knowing about the GI of some foods can help you plan meals when you're pregnant. But the GI of foods can be affected by many things, such as manufacturing process, combination of ingredients, ripeness, or how much it's cooked.Generally speaking, foods that are highly processed or cooked are more likely to have a higher GI, and foods that are raw or high in fiber have a lower GI. Highly processed foods are the biggest concern because they tend to be loaded with starches and added sugar.GI plans can be complicated to follow, and not everyone agrees that they are helpful if you have gestational diabetes. But if you're interested in learning more, ask your provider for advice.Low GI foods include:most fruits, especially apples, oranges, pears, peaches, and mangoesvegetables, such as broccoli, green beans, peas, yams, lettuce, cabbage, and carrotslegumes, such as beans, chickpeas, and lentilsbrown ricewhole oats, and whole-oat-based cereals, such as porridge, oat bran, muesli, and granolamultigrain and pumpernickel breadHigh GI foods include:fruit juiceready-to-eat cerealpizzasodawhite breadshort grain white ricerusset potatoesinstant oatsmacaroni cheese from mixsaltine crackersrice cakespretzelsI've been referred to a dietitian. What can I expect?You'll get medical nutrition therapy (MNT), which is a personalized eating plan you'll work out with your dietitian. This will take into account your weight and how many calories you need each day. A dietitian will talk to you about:how to count carbohydrateshow many carbohydrates to have dailywhen to consume carbohydratestiming insulin with food consumptionthe impact of exercise on diet and insulingetting the vitamins and minerals you need for a healthy pregnancyAs your pregnancy progresses, your dietitian may make changes to your MNT based on the results of blood sugar monitoring and how much weight you've gained. If you need to start taking insulin, you'll still need to follow an eating plan, but a dietitian will likely make some changes to take your treatment into account.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015a.

Chronic high blood pressure and breastfeeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_chronic-high-blood-pressure-and-breastfeeding_10415179.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI have high blood pressure. Can I still breastfeed?Yes, breastfeeding has many health benefits for you and your baby, even when you have high blood pressure. Breastfeeding won't make your condition worse, and might even improve it over the long term. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months of your baby's life.If you had high blood pressure before or during your pregnancy, you'll probably need medication to treat it after you have your baby. And what's best for your health may not be good for an infant. Discuss the benefits and risks of breastfeeding and formula feeding with your healthcare provider to find the option that works best for you.Does high blood pressure medication pass into breast milk?Most high blood pressure drugs pass into breast milk in very small amounts. Many drugs used to treat high blood pressure during pregnancy are considered safe to take when nursing, but they're not all the same. For example, some beta-blockers are found in breast milk in higher amounts and may not be ideal to take when breastfeeding.I'm worried about taking high blood pressure medication while I'm breastfeeding. Should I switch to formula?You're not alone  many women with a high-risk pregnancy worry that their baby may be exposed to medication through their breast milk. There are pros and cons to both breastfeeding and formula feeding, so talk to your provider to make the best choice for you and your baby.It's helpful to know some of the benefits of breastfeeding  experts weigh these against any risks when making a recommendation.It might also be reassuring to know that certain blood pressure medications have been prescribed to breastfeeding moms long enough to have a proven safety record. Ask your provider about the medication you're taking, including how much of the drug could pass into your breast milk.Also, diuretic medications used to treat high blood pressure are considered safe for a baby when breastfeeding, but they could affect your milk supply.Could my high blood pressure make it harder to breastfeed?The condition itself won't make it harder to breastfeed, but the consequences of having high blood pressure might. For example, when you have high blood pressure, you're more likely to have a preterm birth, and a premature baby may not be able to latch on to your breast right away. In this case, you may have to pump, which can make breastfeeding difficult for other reasons.Also, when a baby is born early, it can take longer for your milk to come in. But don't give up  the colostrum your breasts produce at first has important antibodies for your baby. Continue feeding or pumping so your baby gets the nutrition he needs, and your milk supply will gradually increase.If you've had a cesarean section, the pain can make breastfeeding more of a challenge. Ask your provider for support, and try different positions until you find one that's comfortable.

Depression and breastfeeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_depression-and-breastfeeding_10415700.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI have depression. Can I still breastfeed?Yes. Breastfeeding is still the best option for feeding your baby, even if you're taking antidepressant medication for your condition.Breastfeeding is good for you and your baby. Breast milk gives your baby all the nutrition she needs to thrive for the first six months of her life and can prevent infections and sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Breastfeeding also helps you bond with your baby.The flip side is that breastfeeding doesn't always go smoothly in the early days, and you may be at higher risk of postpartum depression (PPD) if you have a hard time breastfeeding.If you're experiencing problems breastfeeding, don't suffer in silence. Talk to your healthcare provider so you can get the advice and support that you need.Can I take antidepressants if I'm breastfeeding?Although small amounts of antidepressant medication do pass through breast milk, many antidepressants are generally considered safe for your breastfeeding baby. The amount of drug that might reach your baby in your milk is very low (generally much lower than the amount that passes through the placenta during pregnancy).Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) are considered the safest medication option for breastfeeding moms. More research has been done on these drugs than on other antidepressants, and only low levels of these drugs are found in breast milk. SSRIs include:CitalopramEscitalopramFluoxetineFluvoxamineParoxetineSertralineOther types of drugs used to treat depression are also considered safe. These include:Serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs), such as venlafaxineTricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), with the exception of the drug doxepinHow can antidepressants affect my baby?Some studies suggest that breastfed babies whose mothers take antidepressants might be a bit more irritable or have difficulties eating and sleeping. But it's worth noting that babies born to mothers with untreated depression also have some of these problems.Call your provider if you're worried that changes in your baby's behavior or eating and sleeping habits might be caused by medications that you're taking. Usually this behavior doesn't last long, but your provider can reassure you and rule out other problems, such as a viral infection.Don't alter your treatment plan or stop taking medication without talking to your provider first. Not taking medication for depression when you need it isn't good for you or your baby. Untreated depression can make it harder to care for and bond with your baby, which can have negative effects on your child's health and development in the future.What medications aren't safe to use when breastfeeding?In addition to the tricyclic antidepressant doxepin, benzodiazepines aren't considered safe to take while you're breastfeeding. Benzodiazepines are used to treat anxiety, a condition that's common in people with depression.Experts are concerned that benzodiazepines may interfere with a baby's brain development. Babies exposed to benzodiazepines through breast milk also are known to be very sleepy and have withdrawal symptoms when the medication or breastfeeding stops.If you can't safely stop using a benzodiazepine, it's best not to breastfeed.Are there alternatives to taking medication while I'm breastfeeding?If your depression is mild, other treatment options can sometimes be effective on their own. For example, talk therapies, such as cognitive behavioral therapy, are effective for managing depression. It can be difficult to attend regular appointments when you have a new baby, but sometimes just a few sessions can make a difference.Taking things easy, eating well, talking to friends and family, and exercising can all help, too.You may be tempted to try herbal remedies or complementary therapies as an alternative to antidepressants if you're breastfeeding, but these are often unregulated and may not be safe to take. For example, the herb St. John's wort can cause colic, drowsiness, and lethargy in babies, so it's not recommended when breastfeeding.What can I do to make breastfeeding easier?Depression can make it hard for you to get a good night's sleep, and breastfeeding will also disrupt your sleep  which could only make your depression worse.Try to catch up on your sleep by napping whenever your baby sleeps. Or have a family member, friend, or babysitter take care of your baby for a few hours so you can sleep. Even if you can't sleep, just resting may be enough to make you feel better.Putting your baby's crib right next to your bed can make nighttime feedings easier, but don't have your baby sleep in bed with you. Antidepressant medication could make you drowsy, which may put your baby at risk of suffocation or SIDS.Your partner can settle your baby after you've finished feeding. Expressing milk also gives your partner the opportunity to feed your baby and you a well-earned break.What are the alternatives to breastfeeding?Don't feel guilty if you choose not to breastfeed, or blame yourself if breastfeeding doesn't work out. Your baby will still get the nourishment she needs from formula, and you can lavish just as much care and attention on your baby while you bottle-feed her.You can still hold your baby skin to skin while you feed her, giving her lots of eye contact and talking softly to her to nurture your bond. Holding your baby this way also helps her feel safe and calm as she feels your warmth and is reassured by your familiar smell.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

The Bradley method of childbirth,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-bradley-method-of-childbirth_631.bc,"What is the Bradley method of childbirth?This method embraces the idea that childbirth is a natural process and that, with the right preparation, most women can avoid pain medication and routine interventions during labor and birth. It's named after American obstetrician Robert Bradley, who developed the method in the late 1940s.The program lasts 12 weeks and is more intensive than other childbirth education classes. You typically start the program in your fifth month of pregnancy, but ""early bird"" classes are sometimes available. Proponents claim that nearly 90 percent of Bradley-trained couples have had spontaneous, unmedicated vaginal births.The Bradley philosophy says that it takes months to prepare for childbirth and parenting  mentally, physically, and emotionally  and prides itself on addressing all aspects of natural childbirth, as well as many pregnancy and postpartum issues. The course also emphasizes educating partners to be effective coaches.What will my partner and I learn in a Bradley course?To make sure the classes are thorough and personal, classes are limited to eight couples and are often even smaller. The course will address:Nutrition and how it affects a growing fetusThe importance of exercise (when appropriate) during pregnancyCommon pregnancy symptoms and complaints, and how to cope with themTechniques for relaxation during labor and birth, with an emphasis on natural breathing methods to help you ""tune-in"" and manage your pain rather than distract you from itMethods to help your partner be an active participant and a skilled coach on labor dayThe stages of labor and how to cope with the changes your body experiences during each oneMedical interventions and how to avoid unnecessary onesHow to reduce your risk of having a c-section and what to do if it becomes medically necessaryMaking a birth plan and how to communicate effectively with your medical teamBreastfeeding, caring for a newborn, and adjusting to your role as parentsHow can I find out more or find a class near me?Call the American Academy of Husband-Coached Childbirth  the organization that Bradley founded to disseminate information about his method  at (800) 422-4784 or visit the group's website to get a list of instructors certified in the Bradley Method who practice in your area.Show sources Hide sources APA. 2007.

Breastfeeding as a working mom,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-as-a-working-mom_641.bc,"Can I continue to breastfeed once I return to work?Yes, you can. If you live near work or have on-site or nearby daycare, you may be able to take nursing breaks to feed your baby. If that's not possible, you have two choices:Option 1: You can keep up your milk supply by using a high-quality electric breast pump to express milk during the workday. Your child's caregiver can give your baby bottles of your expressed breast milk. (You can also supplement with formula if you can't produce enough milk.) You'll still be able to nurse your child whenever you're not at work.The U.S. Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), signed into law in 2010, requires employers to provide moms of babies younger than 12 months a reasonable break time for pumping and a private place to pump, other than a bathroom. (Employers with fewer than 50 employees don't have to comply if compliance would create ""undue hardship."") For more details, read this U.S. government fact sheet.Option 2: If you can't or don't want to pump at work, you can gradually replace daytime feedings with formula while you're still at home but continue to nurse at night and in the morning. Remember, though, that if you don't nurse or pump during the day, your milk supply will diminish.Breastfeeding Problem SolverFind solutions to a variety of breastfeeding challenges, including nipple pain, low milk supply, and more.What are the advantages of pumping at work?Pumping at work stimulates your milk production, so you'll have plenty of milk available when you nurse. Your baby will have the health and nutritional advantages of breast milk even when you're not there. What's more, pumping can be a wonderful way to feel connected to your baby during the workday.You'll save money by not buying formula (or not as much of it). And you may avoid missed workdays, because breastfed babies are half as likely to get sick in their first year as those on formula.One of the best things about continuing to breastfeed is coming home to a baby who wants to nurse. You get to snuggle right away, re-establish your bond, and nurture your baby in a way no one else can.To make sure your baby will want to nurse when you get home, ask your caregiver not to feed him during the last hour of the workday, or to feed him just enough to take the edge off any hunger. Then you and your baby can look forward to a warm reunion every day.Show sources Hide sources DOL. Undated. Fact sheet 73: Break time for nursing mothers under the FSLA.

Vitamin C in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-c-in-your-pregnancy-diet_660.bc,"Why you need vitamin C during pregnancyBoth you and your baby need vitamin C daily because it's necessary for the body to make collagen, a structural protein that's a component of cartilage, tendons, bones, and skin. Based on animal studies, some researchers believe that vitamin C deficiencies in newborn babies can impair mental development.Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C is essential for tissue repair, wound healing, bone growth and repair, and healthy skin. Vitamin C helps your body fight infections and acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage.Vitamin C also helps your body absorbiron, especially from vegetarian sources.How much vitamin C you needPregnant women age 18 and younger: 80 milligrams (mg) per dayPregnant women age 19 and older: 85 mg per dayBreastfeeding women age 18 and younger: 115 mg per dayBreastfeeding women age 19 and older: 120 mg per dayNonpregnant women age 18 and younger: 65 mg per dayNonpregnant women age 19 and older: 75 mg per dayFood sources of vitamin CCitrus fruits are especially high in vitamin C, but leafy greens and many other fruits and vegetables are also excellent sources. Choose fresh foods as your source of vitamin C because heat can destroy this vitamin. Also, some cereals and juices are fortified with vitamin C.Try to include a food rich in vitamin C at every meal to maximize the amount of iron you get from the other foods you eat.Foods that provide vitamin C include:6 ounces orange juice: 62 to 93 mg6 ounces grapefruit juice: 62 to 70 mgone kiwi: 91 mg1/2 cup raw, sweet red bell pepper, chopped: 95 mg1 cup whole strawberries: 85 mgone medium orange: 70 mg1/2 cup broccoli, cooked: 51 mg1/2 medium grapefruit: 38 mgone medium baked potato: 17 mgone medium tomato: 16 mg1 cup raw spinach: 8 mgShould you take a vitamin C supplement?Probably not. It's easiest and safest to get your daily requirement from food. A glass of orange juice at breakfast every day is all you need. (Choose calcium-fortified OJ for even more nutritional value.)Although some studies show that vitamin C supplementation can reduce the incidence of premature rupture of the membranes (PROM), there is some concern that taking vitamin C supplements during pregnancy may raise the risk ofpreterm birth.There are also reports (though rare) of babies born to mothers who took excessive vitamin C supplements during pregnancy developing scurvy, a severe vitamin C deficiency.If you're concerned about your vitamin C intake, talk with your healthcare provider.The signs of a vitamin C deficiencySigns of a deficiency include fatigue, gum inflammation, slow-healing cuts, bruises, and rough, dry skin.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014.

Iodine in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iodine-in-your-pregnancy-diet_667.bc,"Why you need iodine during pregnancyIodine is essential to the development of your baby's brain and nervous system. It also regulates your baby's metabolism (the rate at which the body uses energy). Iodine plays an important role in regulating your thyroid gland. A lack of iodine during pregnancy has been linked with an increased risk of miscarriage,preterm delivery, and stillbirth.How much iodine you needPregnant women: 220 micrograms (mcg) per dayBreastfeeding women: 290 mcg per dayNonpregnant women: 150 mcg per dayYou don't have to get the recommended amount of iodine every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Food sources of iodineIodine is found indairy products, eggs, vegetables, seafood, and brewer's yeast. (The amount of iodine in many types of food varies according to the amount of iodine in the area's soil or water.)Good food sources of iodine include:1 cup milk: 99 mcg3 ounces cod: 99 mcg1 gram iodized salt (about 1/8 teaspoon): 77 mcgone medium baked potato with skin: 60 mcg3 ounces shrimp: 35 mcgtwo fish sticks: 35 mcg3 ounces turkey breast, baked: 34 mcg1/2 cup cooked navy beans: 32 mcg3 ounces tuna, canned in oil: 17 mcgone large egg, hard boiled: 12 mcg(Note: Sea vegetables contain large amounts of iodine  sometimes even too much for regular consumption. Just one-quarter of an ounce of dried seaweed can contain more than 4,500 mcg of iodine, which is more than four times the tolerable upper intake level. The maximum amount considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine is 1,100 mcg per day.)Should you take an iodine supplement?Prenatal vitaminsdon't contain a reliable amount of iodine, but you probably still won't need to take a supplement because it's easy to meet your requirement with food.In the United States, about half of all table salt is enriched with iodine to prevent iodine deficiencies. Read the label to make sure. Also check the amount because it can vary widely. (Sea salt doesn't always contain iodine, and the salt in processed food is rarely iodized.)In general, Americans get more than enough salt in their diets: The Centers for Disease Control estimates that the average American gets about 48 percent more salt than recommended. Still, you might want to tally your iodine intake for a day to make sure you're getting enough.The signs of an iodine deficiencyIodine deficiencies are uncommon in the United States, but worldwide, iodine deficiencies are the single most important cause of preventable intellectual disability and brain damage.Signs of thyroid problems from a lack of iodine include an enlarged thyroid gland, fatigue, weakness, depression, intolerance to cold, and weight gain. If you're concerned that you may have an iodine deficiency, talk with your doctor or midwife.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2015. Iodine, a critically important nutrient.

Six healthy fixes for pregnancy junk food cravings,https://www.babycenter.com/0_six-healthy-fixes-for-pregnancy-junk-food-cravings_669.bc,"Many womencrave particular foods during pregnancy. And while some may pine for broccoli, bananas, or oatmeal, most probably have visions of cookies, chocolate, and ice cream dancing in their heads.If your desire for sugar and fat feels too powerful to resist, it's okay to indulge occasionally. But try to keep your cravings in check, so your growing baby gets all the nutrients he needs. (If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes orgestational diabetes, follow the diet your provider recommended for you.)Here are six ways to control your cravings without feeling deprived:Eat breakfast every day. If you start the day well nourished, you'll be less susceptible to midmorning snack cravings. One winning combination: a hard-cooked egg, an orange, half a whole grain English muffin, and a glass of milk.Exercise regularly.

Manganese in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_manganese-in-your-pregnancy-diet_750.bc,"Why you need manganese during pregnancyManganese is a mineral that helps form bone and cartilage. It also helps protect cells from damage and activates the enzymes that play a role in the metabolism of carbohydrates, amino acids, and cholesterol.How much manganese you needPregnant women: 2 milligrams (mg) per dayBreastfeeding women: 2.6 mg per dayNonpregnant women age 18 and younger: 1.6 mg per dayNonpregnant women age 19 and older: 1.8 mg per dayYou don't have to get the recommended amount of manganese every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Food sources of manganeseYou'll find manganese in whole grain breads, cereals, pastas, brown rice, beans, legumes, tea, and nuts. Here are a few examples:1 cup raisin bran cereal: 0.78 to 3.02 mg1 ounce pecans: 1.28 mg1/2 cup brown rice, cooked: 1.07 mgone packet instant oatmeal prepared with water: 0.99 mg1/2 cup cooked spinach: 0.84 mg1/2 cup raw pineapple chunks: 0.77 mg1 ounce whole almonds: 0.65 mg4 ounces pineapple juice: 0.63 mgone slice whole wheat bread: 0.6 mg1 ounce peanuts: 0.55 mg1/2 cup lima beans, cooked: 0.49 mg1/2 cup navy beans, cooked: 0.48 mg1/2 cup sweet potato, mashed: 0.44 mg8 ounces green tea: 0.41 to 1.58 mg8 ounces black tea: 0.18 to 0.77 mgShould you take a supplement?Probably not. Manganese is generally not included inprenatal vitamins because most women get what they need from food. Some drinking water contains manganese, but usually less than 10 micrograms per liter.Getting too much manganese  whether from supplements or environmental exposure  can be toxic. (Sometimes industrial workers and people living near certain types of factories are exposed to dust containing manganese.)The maximum amount of manganese that's considered safe (the tolerable upper intake level), calculated by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine, is 11 mg daily for adults age 19 and over. (For those 18 years and younger, it's 9 mg.)Manganese deficiencies are pretty much unheard of because the mineral is found in so many different foods.Show sources Hide sources ATSDR. 2012.

Pregnancy weight gain: What to expect,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pregnancy-weight-gain-what-to-expect_1466.bc,"How much weight should I gain during my pregnancy?It depends on how much you weighed before you conceived and whether that's the appropriate weight for your height. The relationship between your height and weight is expressed in a number called a body mass index, or BMI. You can calculate your BMI here.The guidelines for pregnancy weight gain are determined by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). Here are the most current recommendations, set in 2009:Healthy weight (BMI of 18.5 to 24.9): If your pre-pregnancy weight was in the healthy range for your height when you conceive, you should gain between 25 and 35 pounds. For the optimal growth of your baby, aim to put on 1 to 5 pounds in the first trimester and about 1 pound per week for the rest of your pregnancy.Underweight (BMI below 18.5): If you were underweight for your height, you should gain 28 to 40 pounds.Overweight (BMI of 25 to 29.9): If you were overweight for your height, you should gain 15 to 25 pounds.Obese (a BMI of 30 or higher): If you were obese for your height, you should gain between 11 and 20 pounds.Carrying twins: If you're having twins you should gain:37 to 54 pounds if you are at a healthy weight31 to 50 pounds if you are overweight25 to 42 pounds if you are obeseWeight gain and pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:25Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:25Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosWhat if I gain too much or too little weight during my pregnancy?The babies of women who gain more than the recommended amount of weight during pregnancy may be larger than normal at birth, which can cause labor complications for both you and your baby. For example, studies show that women who gain too much during pregnancy are at higher risk for having a cesarean delivery or a premature birth. They also tend to retain more weight after pregnancy and weigh more during subsequent pregnancies.However, the risks for women who gain too much during pregnancy are less than the risks for women who are overweight when they conceive. Women who start pregnancy overweight are at higher risk for complications, including gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. Women who are obese are also at higher risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, or having a baby with birth defects.SlideshowPregnancy weight gain recommendationsIn addition, women who are overweight or obese before pregnancy tend to have trouble starting and continuing breastfeeding. Experts believe reasons for this may include poor milk production and difficulty positioning the baby for nursing. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may make this problem worse.But fortunately, many weight-related health conditions and situations can be managed or even avoided with the right lifestyle changes. Talk with your doctor or midwife about ways to lower your risk factors. By exercising, eating well, and staying within your guidelines for weight gain, you can significantly boost your chances of having a perfectly healthy pregnancy and delivery.On the other hand, if you started pregnancy underweight, or if you don't gain enough during pregnancy, you have a higher risk of delivering a preterm infant or a low-birth-weight baby (less than 5.5 pounds). Prematurity can cause lifelong health problems or even be fatal for the baby, especially in very preterm births. Ask your healthcare provider for advice on coming up with a sensible meal plan that includes all the calories and nutrients you and your baby need.How much weight do most pregnant women gain?About a third of women gain within the amount recommended by the IOM, and about half gain more. Most underweight women gain within the guidelines, but some women at a healthy weight exceed the advised amounts. Most overweight or obese women gain too much.The IOM guidelines urge prenatal caregivers to counsel women about diet and exercise more effectively so that expectant mothers have a better chance of staying within the recommended weight limits.How do I deal with anxiety about gaining weight during pregnancy?If you've struggled with your weight in the past, or even if you've never dieted in your life, you may have a hard time accepting that it's okay to gain weight now. It's normal to feel anxious as the numbers on the scale inch up. Just try to keep in mind that gaining weight is important for a healthy pregnancy and that those extra pounds will eventually come off after you've had the baby.If weight gain is getting you down, you're not alone. Find out how other moms-to-be are coping with putting on the pregnancy pounds.How do I lose weight after I give birth?A certain amount of the weight you've been accumulating will disappear shortly after you give birth. Mothers who gained a healthy amount of weight during pregnancy usually lose about half of their pregnancy weight in the first six weeks after delivery. The baby accounts for about 7.5 pounds (more or less), and the amniotic fluid, placenta, extra body fluids, fat stores, and blood in your body add up to another 8 to 12 pounds.For the rest, remember that it took nine months to put on the weight, and it can take just as long (or longer) for it to come off. A healthy diet combined with regular exercise and exclusive breastfeeding is the most effective way to shed the pounds  and keep them off.Don't start cutting back on calories right away, though. Having a newborn requires lots of energy  and that means giving your body all the nutrition it needs. If you're patient, you may be surprised at how much weight you lose naturally, especially if you're breastfeeding.If you do have trouble losing weight, consider seeing a registered dietitian and perhaps a fitness trainer to help you lose the appropriate amount of weight at a healthy rate.Learn more:Eight things nutritionists wish you'd do during pregnancyTen ways to make your pregnancy pounds pay offThe pregnancy body survey: 1,500 women talk weight gain, body changes, and moreLearn all about weight gain during pregnancyShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

Feedings during the night: 1 to 2 years,https://www.babycenter.com/0_feedings-during-the-night-1-to-2-years_3665.bc,"To feed or not to feed in the middle of the night  that is the question. Experts agree that if your baby is younger than 6 months old, you should feed him whenever he wakes at night.But once he's past the 6-month marker, skip the midnight snack. The goal is to separate eating from going to sleep so that if your toddler does wake up at night, he won't need your breast or a bottle to get back to sleep.What should you do if your toddler still wants to eat at night? We turned to five leading sources: child psychologist and sleep expertJodi Mindell, experts at theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics, and pediatriciansRichard Ferber,T. Berry Brazelton, andWilliam Sears.Mindell's viewAt this age, your child should be getting enough nutrition during the day so that she doesn't need to eat at night. You may make sleep problems more likely if you continue to breastfeed or give her a bottle when she wakes during the night.If you're breastfeeding, gradually shorten the time she nurses. Change the time you nurse so it isn't near the time your child falls asleep, and have someone else put her to bed so she doesn't smell your milk.You can cut out bottle-feeding by reducing the amount of formula by 1 ounce every night.The AAP's viewIf your child is used to getting a lot of attention at night, it's time to gradually retrain him. If you've been giving him milk when he wakes up, for example, either dilute it or switch to water and gradually stop giving him anything. He needs to learn that nighttime is for sleeping.Ferber's viewTry not to associate feeding your child with her going to sleep. If she falls asleep while she's eating, stop and put her in her crib. As she gets older, gradually reduce the number and frequency of her feedings.Brazelton's viewIf your child still wants to drink out of a bottle, you can make it part of your bedtime ritual, along with a story and so on. At this age, he needs the bottle more for comfort and relaxation than anything else.Don't put a bottle in bed with him, though. It can contribute to tooth decay and acts as a substitute source of security.Sears's viewTry to teach your child various sleep associations that don't involve eating so she doesn't get locked into needing food to help her nod off.Give her a bottle in a rocking chair and then help her snuggle with a transitional object, such as a teddy bear. Then transfer your child and the teddy bear to bed, but leave the bottle behind.For more help finding a bedtime approach that suits your family, check out our list ofexpert advice, books, websites, and other resources.Parent Poll:Which expert's sleep advice have you found the most helpful?"
Dads-to-be: Diet changes to boost your fertility,https://www.babycenter.com/0_dads-to-be-diet-changes-to-boost-your-fertility_4188.bc,"Nutrition has a direct impact on the potency of your sperm. Research shows that having a poor diet and drinking alcohol regularly, for instance, can lower the quality and quantity of sperm and make conception more difficult. And since infertility is nearly as much a man's issue as a woman's  about a third of fertility problems can be traced to men  eating healthfully now can boost your chances of conceiving a child.Additional research shows that dads who are heavy drinkers risk damaging their sperm. If you drink, have no more than one or two drinks a day.Whether drinking coffee harms or helps your fertility is less clear. The safest bet is to drink no more than a cup or two a day.Which nutrients are most important?Your diet should be every bit as balanced, varied, and nutritious as your partner's. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, research shows that a healthy diet including plenty of fish, vegetables, and whole grains means more active sperm. On the other hand, a diet high in trans fats may lower the number of sperm in semen.Some specific advice for future dads:Eat plenty of foods rich in vitamin C and other antioxidants. These nutrients help prevent sperm defects and boost motility (movement). An 8-ounce glass of orange juice has about 124 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C. Aim to get at least 90 mg a day  more if you smoke (at least 125 mg).Get enough zinc. A lack of zinc can make sperm clump together and contribute to infertility. Great sources to help you get the 11 mg you need daily include oysters (16 mg in six medium oysters), extra-lean beef tenderloin (4.8 mg per 3-ounce serving), baked beans (3.5 mg per 1-cup serving), and dark chicken meat (2.38 mg per 3-ounce serving).Fuel up on folic acid. Studies suggest that men with low levels of this key B vitamin  the same one women need to reduce the baby's risk of neural tube birth defects  have trouble producing healthy sperm. You may be able to get the daily minimum of 400 micrograms from fortified breakfast cereals, leafy greens, legumes, and orange juice, but taking a folic acid or a multivitamin supplement for extra insurance can't hurt.Cut out (or cut back on) alcohol. An occasional drink is generally considered safe, but studies show that drinking wine, beer, or hard liquor daily can reduce testosterone levels and sperm counts and raise the number of abnormal sperm in your ejaculate.Take a multivitamin tablet every day. A pill is no substitute for a healthy diet, but a multivitamin can help you make sure you're getting the nutrients you need.Show sources Hide sources American Dietetic Association. Undated.

Won't have a bowel movement on the potty,https://www.babycenter.com/0_wont-have-a-bowel-movement-on-the-potty_4417.bc,"How do you persuade a child to have a bowel movement on the toilet?One of the main things to do is check the consistency of your child's stools. Most children who refuse to toilet (they'll have their bowel movements in their diapers, disposable training pants, or pants, but not in the toilet) have had problems with constipation. Make sure your child has soft, formed stools. Hard stools, large stools, or small pebbly stools are all signs of constipation, and the most common reason for stool withholding or ""toileting refusal"" is that the child has had one or more bowel movements that were painful or uncomfortable.The main way to soften the consistency of a child's stools is through his diet, by getting him to eat more fiber and by monitoring his intake of dairy products. The easiest way to calculate the amount of dietary fiber your child is getting is to look it up on the nutritional information label on his food. A good rule of thumb is that children should eat enough grams of fiber to equal their age plus five (for example, a 4-year-old needs 9 grams of fiber each day). It's also best if the fiber is distributed equally among the three meals, rather than eaten all at once.It can take weeks, sometimes months, for a child to get over having a painful bowel movement. Although I hear all the time that a child has accidents because he is angry or resentful, this is rarely the case. He has accidents because he holds back his painful stools until he can't hold them anymore.Once your child is routinely having soft, formed bowel movements, keep track of when he has them to see if there is any pattern to them. If you can tell that it's about time for him to poop, you can encourage him to sit on the toilet.I also recommend what I call toilet sits, encouraging your child to sit on the toilet several times each day, without any pressure to have a bowel movement. These toilet sits are more to get him accustomed to sitting on the toilet than they are to get him to use it. It's all right to have him do a dozen toilet sits each day without his ever having a bowel movement there. Your goal is to get him to learn to relax while sitting on the toilet.Also, make certain that he can place his feet firmly on the floor, if he's on a potty chair, or on a step stool or two if he's on the regular toilet. Being able to plant his feet on the floor means that he can get on the potty chair or toilet easily, that he feels stable and secure when seated, and that he can push with his feet to give him leverage. All of these are important to independent toileting.Other common problemsFrequent bed-wettingHandling accidentsMaintaining interestWon't sit on the pottyGoing to the bathroom in public places"

Alternative therapies for ADHD,https://www.babycenter.com/0_alternative-therapies-for-adhd_67364.bc,"If you're not satisfied with mainstream ADHD treatments such as medication and behavior therapy, you may be tempted to explore alternative or complementary therapies to help your child manage his condition. There's little reliable scientific evidence to show that any of these therapies are helpful for children with ADHD, and most major health organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder (CHADD) do not endorse them. But each of the following therapies has a significant following among some parents and practitioners. If any of these alternative methods appeal to you, talk to your practitioner about how you might incorporate them into your child's treatment program.Art therapySome experts believe that engaging in creative activities such as drawing, listening to music, or dancing helps children with ADHD calm down and focus better. ""Art utilizes the part of the brain that controls emotions,"" says George Lynn, therapist and author of Survival Strategies for Parenting Your ADD Child. ""Children with ADHD often have trouble controlling their emotions and these activities can help calm them."" Several studies suggest that music can help children with ADHD concentrate more easily, but more research needs to be done to confirm this. Still, some therapists and parents of children with ADHD say that these kids often do have an affinity for music and other kinds of artistic expression, and finding a creative outlet that allows your child to excel and express himself can be a great self-esteem booster.BiofeedbackBiofeedback can help teach a child to calm down and focus by training him, through the use of a special machine, to control his body's responses to stress, including pulse rate, breathing rate, and muscle tension. When the child is ""hooked up"" to the machine, it will tell him when his pulse rate is up, for example, indicating that he's upset or excited, and when it's coming back down, indicating that he's succeeding in calming himself. With practice, proponents say, he may learn to calm himself without using the machine. Preliminary research shows that biofeedback may be helpful in reducing the symptoms of ADHD, although much more needs to be conducted to say for sure. Biofeedback takes a number of sessions to show results, the results may not last beyond the sessions, and it may not work well in young children, who tend to have less control over their emotions.AcupunctureAcupuncture, widely used in Chinese medicine and gaining acceptance in Western medicine, involves stimulating certain points on the body with thin needles to improve the way the body functions. In 1993, the National Institutes of Health funded a grant for researchers to examine acupuncture's potential in treating ADHD. The results of the very small controlled clinical trial proved promising: More than half the children showed improvement in their symptoms. Still, more research is needed to determine whether acupuncture will be a safe and effective treatment for ADHD. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)This form of psychotherapy attempts to teach a person to think about his motivations before he acts. Many experts contend that, while CBT works well for many adults, there isn't any evidence that it's effective for kids with ADHD. ""With CBT, you're essentially asking a child who can't think before he acts to think before he acts,"" says Andrew Adesman, director of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park, New York. However, a few experts have found CBT to be helpful, especially when it's incorporated into certain discipline techniques. ""Cognitive therapy for kids with impulsive, aggressive, and hyperactive behavior involves getting them to act independently, without reminders or cajoling from you or their teachers,"" says David Stein, psychologist and author of Ritalin Is Not the Answer and Unraveling the ADD / ADHD Fiasco. ""You use consequences to teach children to think, not just to mindlessly obey."" For example, Stein suggests requiring children to tell you why they were given a time-out immediately following the punishment  and if they can't tell you, to enforce another time-out. If you're interested, you can learn these techniques from a CBT therapist who works with children (ask your practitioner for a referral) or by doing your own reading.Parenting strategies for treating symptomsA number of experts don't believe that ADHD should be considered a condition that requires a cure. They contend that parenting strategies alone can turn around symptoms such as hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity in any child. Howard Glasser, family therapist and co-author of Transforming the Difficult Child, believes that some children develop ADHD-like symptoms because they find that they get more attention from their parents and teachers when things are going wrong. A parent's typical response to a child when things are going well is relatively low key in comparison to the more animated and emotional responses children receive for misbehavior. ""These children inadvertently discover that they get more of a reaction when they're having a hard time, and that deepens their impression that people are more interested in them in relation to their problems,"" says Glasser. He recommends, among other things, that parents become much more animated in their recognition and appreciation when their children are behaving well and when rules aren't being broken. In his book, Glasser suggests ways parents can encourage their children to use their intensity successfully instead of trying to quell it. ""My feeling is that intensity is a gift, and if you know what to do with it, it can become a source of greatness,"" he says. (Many of these strategies would fit in well with mainstream behavior therapy techniques.) Dietary changesAvoiding food dyes and additives According to a recent report issued by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a small body of research (including a 1982 study by the National Institutes of Health) suggests that food dyes  and possibly preservatives, as well  can aggravate behavior problems in a small percentage of children with ADHD. You can test this theory in your own child's case by eliminating foods and vitamins containing colorings with names like tartrazine, Red 40, and Yellow 5 from your child's diet for several weeks to see if your child's behavior or mood improves. Many foods that contain these ingredients, such as cookies, candies, children's cereals, brightly-colored beverages, and soft drinks, should probably not make up a large part of your child's diet anyway.Avoiding salicylate and food allergens A few experts advocate eliminating foods that contain the naturally occurring substance salicylate, such as apples, oranges, berries, apricots, and tomatoes. (A regimen called the Feingold Diet, created in the 1970s by Benjamin Feingold, an allergist, advocates eliminating foods that contain salicylate as well as food dyes and additives from the diet of children with ADHD. Studies on the effectiveness of this regimen have had widely varying results.) Several experts also believe that food allergies may aggravate the symptoms of ADHD and recommend eliminating foods they believe may be triggers, such as wheat, corn, chocolate, and eggs, but very little research has been done on this. If you suspect that your child may be allergic or behaviorally sensitive to any of these foods, talk to a nutritionist or allergist before removing them from his diet to ensure that your child is still getting all the nutrients his growing body needs.Limiting sugar While many studies have examined a possible link between sugar and hyperactivity, none has found a significant relationship. Still, some parents swear that their children act out more after eating foods that contain a lot of refined sugar. It may be more likely that sugary foods contain other ingredients (food dyes, for example) that may worsen a child's behavior. In any event, it can't hurt to reduce the amount of sugar in your child's diet. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, children consume an average of twice the amount recommended. And while some people worry that using sugar substitutes such as saccharine or aspartame may have ill health effects, there's no evidence that they affect behavior in children with ADHD.Limiting carbohydrates This theory suggests that a diet overly rich in carbohydrates can cause cyclical spikes and drops in blood sugar levels and exacerbate the symptoms of ADHD. ""There's some evidence that kids with ADHD crave carbohydrates, particularly refined or simple carbs such as sugar and fruit, and in a small percentage of cases, eating these foods does seem to make the symptoms worse,"" says Lynn. Proponents of this theory recommend avoiding simple carbohydrates and replacing them with protein- and fiber-rich foods, such as meats and vegetables, but most experts don't subscribe to this strategy as a treatment for ADHD. ""The best advice is to offer your child a balanced diet,"" says Lynn. SupplementsFatty acids Preliminary research shows that supplementing a child's diet with the essential fatty acid omega-3 (commonly called ""fish oil"" because it's found in fish) can help him manage his ADHD symptoms. This strategy is based on the premise that the brain needs certain fatty acids to function properly, and that ADHD symptoms like inattentiveness and impulsivity result from a deficiency of omega-3. In fact, children with ADHD do appear to have naturally lower levels of these lipids than other children do. Researchers are currently conducting studies to test the validity of the theory. Fatty acid supplements are considered fairly safe if you stick to the recommended dose; still you should always talk to your doctor before giving your child supplements of any kind.Megavitamins and nutrients Some proponents claim that giving a child with ADHD large amounts of certain vitamins (such as B6 and B12), minerals (such as zinc), trace elements, and other nutritional elements can alleviate symptoms. Currently, very little reliable research exists to support this theory. Giving your child large doses of certain vitamins and minerals can, in fact, be dangerous. Offering a balanced and nutritious diet is the best way to ensure that he's getting the nutrients he needs. Speak to your child's doctor if you are concerned about his nutrition.Homeopathy Some people claim that homeopathic remedies can significantly improve the symptoms of ADHD. The theory behind homeopathy is that certain potentially toxic substances, when taken in an extremely diluted form, can trigger the body's natural healing process. There are currently no reliable studies showing that homeopathy is effective for treating ADHD.Herbs While you may be tempted to try giving your child herbs, such as valerian and ginkgo, that are thought to calm the nerves and increase the ability to focus, no research currently exists to show that taking herbs can reduce the symptoms of ADHD. And although herbs are ""natural,"" they can be as potent as prescription drugs, especially for children. Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates herbs only minimally, you can never be sure that you're even getting what the label indicates. Always speak with your doctor before giving your child any over-the-counter product, whether natural or synthetic. How to evaluate alternative therapiesWhen you're considering any alternative option for your child, the organization Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder (CHADD) suggests the following guidelines.Ask the provider (if there is one):Have clinical trials been conducted on this approach, and if so, can I see the research?Is there a national organization of practitioners that licenses or accredits those who practice the treatment?Be suspicious if the treatment:claims it will work for everyone with ADHD and will also cure other health problemsuses only case histories or testimonials as proof of effectivenessdoesn't list the contents or include directions for proper usedoesn't contain information warning about side effects (for supplements)is described as harmless because it's ""natural"" (most drugs are developed from ""natural"" sources)is available from only one source, such as a mail-order companyis promoted through infomercialsis described as ""miraculous"""
Top 7 mommy guilt trips - and how to handle them,https://www.babycenter.com/0_top-7-mommy-guilt-trips-and-how-to-handle-them_3654967.bc,"Mommy guilt is like PMS  we all get it from time to time. In fact, a whopping 94 percent of moms in a recent BabyCenter survey fessed up to feeling shame over issues ranging from the amount of time they spend with their kids to the kind of diapers they use.Mommy guilt is an equal-opportunity affliction, the experts say  it strikes whether you're 20 or 40, CEO of your home or a Fortune 500 company, living in the big city or on Main Street USA.""We found that moms from all walks of life have mommy guilt, which blows the 'grass is greener' thing right out of the water,"" say Devra Renner and Aviva Pflock, coauthors of Mommy Guilt: Learn to Worry Less, Focus on What Matters Most, and Raise Happier Kids.But guilt can actually serve as a helpful tool  as long as you don't take it too far. ""It can provide a check and balance,"" says Pflock. ""The trick is that you want to be in control of the guilt, rather than letting the guilt control you.""To help you take charge of your own mommy guilt, we've given a rundown of the most common mom cringe-inducers and what to do about them.1. Feeding your baby formulaYou pull out a bottle to feed your crying baby and notice raised eyebrows all around. It turns out that the other moms you're with all breastfeed exclusively.Soothe it! You may feel like you're the only formula-feeding mom in the universe, but this is far from the truth. Whether it's due to supply issues, latch-on problems, going back to work, or something else entirely, many mothers find themselves relying on formula to supplement or replace breastfeeding.According to the Centers for Disease Control, 42 percent of U.S. moms are breastfeeding at 6 months and 22 percent at a year. And in a BabyCenter poll, 67 percent of moms said their babies had formula in the first six months. In other words, there's a lot of the stuff floating around.And still, we feel bad: In that same poll, 79 percent of moms who'd stopped nursing said they felt guilty about it. ""After a few weeks of crying more than my infant, I finally switched to formula. But now I'm consumed with guilt,"" says one mom. ""Everywhere I look, even on formula packages, breastfeeding is touted as best.""If you're grieving the loss of nursing, allow yourself your sadness. But then accept that you did your best, and move on. Breast milk is best for your baby, but formula-fed babies are also thriving, nourished, and nurtured. As one BabyCenter mom says, ""The best thing you can do for your baby is to be a happy mom  and if that means no breastfeeding, then that's the best choice for your family.""2. Using TV as a babysitterTime to cook dinner, so you plop the kids down in front of the tube so they won't be underfoot. They're happy, but you feel a pang of guilt as you see their jaws go slack and their eyes get that faraway look.Soothe it! In 2003, the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that children under 2 shouldn't watch any television. No more popping in a DVD while you grab a shower, no more cuddling on the couch and watching kids' programs.This recommendation became instant fodder for mommy guilt. ""I started letting my son watch educational programs when he was 1 and he still watches DVDs. But after reading about not allowing any TV for kids under 2, I'm panicking!"" says one BabyCenter mom.But if you break this rule, you're not alone: A poll of BabyCenter moms reveals that only 10 percent of moms with toddlers forbid TV completely. Sixty-seven percent think it's okay to let babies watch some TV, and 69 percent let their child watch the TV shows and DVDs they're watching. But the shame is still in play: 26 percent of moms lie about how much TV their children watch!Is television really so evil? No, say Renner and Pflock: ""Using television entertainment as a form of quiet time is perfectly appropriate."" The key is moderation. If your child is under 2, keep viewing time to a minimum, and break it into 15-minute chunks. Watch with your child, and pick programs that are appropriate. If your child is older, see our TV guidelines for preschoolers and big kids. Then relax and send your guilt on its way. What are your ""bad mommy"" moments?Real moms confess their darkest secrets and guilty pleasures. 3. Being environmentally unfriendlyAs you throw out a trash bag bursting with disposable diapers and Styrofoam cups, you spot your neighbor hanging cloth diapers on her clothesline. Her new hybrid is parked on the street, not far from your gas-guzzler.Soothe it! It can seem like Kermit the Frog was singing directly to us parents when he warbled: ""It's not that easy bein' green."" Conveniences like disposable diapers and wipes, bottles of water, and paper towels can feel essential when we're stretching to keep our family's life humming along smoothly. And having kids usually leads to consuming more resources like water, electricity, and gasoline.But raising children can also make us more conscious of our impact on the earth  47 percent of parents in a BabyCenter poll are more concerned about the environment since having kids. And 55 percent are ""extremely"" or ""very"" concerned about environmental issues. After all, we want the world to be in the best shape possible for our kids.This push and pull can lead to a nasty case of green guilt. Let this be a wake-up call  but know that letting guilt devour you won't do you or the earth any good. You may not be able to take public transportation to work, switch to cloth diapers, hang your laundry on the line, or toss out all your environmentally unfriendly cleaners right now.Instead, focus on the dozens of achievable changes you can make. Try unplugging appliances when they're not in use, doing your laundry in cold water when possible, lighting your home with fluorescent bulbs, and other easy, earth-friendly tricks. Don't worry too much about the Greens next door  maybe someday soon you'll be giving them tips.4. Feeding your kids junk foodAt the end of a long, stressful day, the drive-through calls. But as you hand the crinkly bags back to your now-ecstatic children, you think about your own mother, who never did this.Soothe it! Sure, there are kids out there who don't know a French fry from a French twist. Maybe you even used to be one of them. If your own kids can sniff out a fry from a mile away, though, rest assured that you're not alone  76 percent of BabyCenter parents say they rely on fast food a few times a month or more.Sometimes we forget that fast food  while not usually the best nutritional option  isn't poisonous. As with television, the key is moderation and smart choices.Eating fast food as often as twice a week is fine as long as you choose relatively low-fat options, says Mary Savoye-Desanti, a bionutritionist at Yale University and director of the Bright Bodies Program.That could mean ordering a regular single-patty hamburger instead of a double-patty burger loaded with sauce and cheese, a sandwich with chicken that's grilled rather than fried, a pizza with extra vegetables and less cheese instead of pepperoni, or a baked potato or side salad in place of fries. Get more tips and nutritional information from major fast-food chains.If your family is turning to fast food more often than meals prepared at home, however, make some changes. You can serve healthy foods without spending hours in the kitchen  try prepared foods from the grocery store like roasted chicken, sliced roast beef, and bagged salads.When you do take your kids to the drive-through, let them know that fast food is a ""once in a while"" thing. Then shoo your guilt out the car window. 5. Leaving your child with another caregiverIt's the first day of daycare and your baby seems fine  but you're a wreck. Tears drip down your face as you stop for one last kiss, and you drive to work fighting the urge to turn around.Soothe it! Working moms often struggle with intense guilt  especially when they first go back. ""Since I was returning to a job I loved, I thought I'd feel happy and worthwhile. I didn't expect those feelings to be so tempered by guilt,"" says mom Johanna Villanueva.Working moms can also feel guilty for wanting to work. Tela Durbin of Working Moms Against Guilt was tearful and upset when she left her son at daycare  but she also felt relieved to have some time away from his colic. ""I had two kinds of guilt  guilt for leaving him and guilt for wanting the break,"" she says.If you're in this position, know that studies have shown time and time again that good childcare can promote cognitive, language, and social skills. Relieve your guilt by choosing the best daycare center, home daycare, babysitter, or nanny that you can.To ease the transition, become familiar with your care provider before you go back to work, says Durbin. ""Do practice runs. Maybe even leave your child there for a few hours while you run an errand.""Stay away from the online ""mommy wars"" between working and at-home moms, and tune out any judgmental comments you may receive. This vulnerable period is no time to jump into the fray. There are many online groups for working moms where you can find support  turn to one of these instead.And finally, remember that your work serves a crucial purpose. As Durbin says, ""You know you're doing what's best for your family, whether you're working for financial reasons or because it makes you happy."" 6. Yelling at your kidsYour toddler starts shrieking moments after your baby finally goes down for her nap. ""Don't wake the baby!"" you snap, much louder than you meant to. Your toddler looks at you with wide, frightened eyes.Soothe it! No one feels good about yelling at their kids. In fact, Pflock and Renner's survey of mothers found that yelling is the number one cause of mommy guilt.When this happens, take a careful look at your own behavior. Was the yelling out of the ordinary? Are you usually calm with your child? If yes, then let yourself off the hook and take this as a learning opportunity for both of you. As Elizabeth Pantley says in The No-Cry Discipline Solution, ""Even the most peaceful easy-going parent loses patience and yells from time to time.""Reassure your child that everything is okay, and explain what happened: ""Sometimes people yell when they're upset. But that can hurt people's feelings. I'm sorry. It would have been better if I had said 'Please be quiet. The baby is sleeping.'""But if screaming is becoming a habit, you may need to take action to manage your anger and reduce your stress levels. Join a support group, see a counselor, read relevant books and articles, or get help from moms in our Community. You can also check out tips on avoiding yelling from BabyCenter moms.""I ended up talking to a therapist, and he showed me that it was all about stress,"" says one BabyCenter mom of her yelling habit. ""I committed to finding ways of reducing stress  I gave up some work, exercised more, got a little more relaxed about the housework. It was very hard, because I'm a control freak, but it paid off.""7. Not being able to afford all the extrasYour mommy friends have all signed up for a popular  and expensive  kids' music class. You'd love to join, but you can't afford it. You gloomily envision their children playing in the symphony, while your own child mops up their sweat.Soothe it! It's easy to feel bad when you can't afford an activity for your child, or when you're the only mom in the playground with a plain stroller rather than a deluxe model loaded with bells and whistles.But many of the things that we think of as ""necessary"" aren't. What kids really need is love  not the next expensive activity or ""It toy."" In fact, too much stuff can be a problem. ""If you're constantly overindulging your children, they'll never learn the value of money,"" explains psychotherapist Kate Levinson, who leads workshops for women to explore their emotional relationship to money. ""You also want to teach them how to enjoy life and solve problems in ways that don't have to do with buying things or using money.""Instead of focusing on what you can't give your child, focus on what he can have. For example, instead of the high-end music class, try a free class or library story time. If he loves to ""cook"" but you can't afford a play kitchen, help him make one out of a cardboard box. You'll probably feel your guilt drain away as you watch him happily banging on his new stove.More:""Bad mommy"" moments: See the photosAvoiding new-mom comparison traps"
Autism glossary: Key terms parents need to know,https://www.babycenter.com/0_autism-glossary-key-terms-parents-need-to-know_10396951.bc,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complicated condition to understand  and the sea of capital letters, bewildering acronyms, and medical terminology doesn't make it any easier for parents. As you work on getting help for your child, here are some key terms to know.Affordable Care Act (ACA): A federal law, signed in 2010, that says all children are entitled to free screening for autism spectrum disorder at 18 and 24 months. It also says that children can stay on a parent's health plan until age 26, whether they're living at home, in a facility, or on their own. Health plans must cover preexisting conditions as well as prescriptions, behavioral health treatment, and other services, including applied behavior analysis in some states.Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA): A 1990 law that bans discrimination against people with disabilities and requires they have equal opportunities in education, public accommodations, employment, and other areas.applied behavior analysis (ABA): A therapeutic approach that encourages desired behavior and skills. There are many different forms of ABA, including positive behavior support (PBS) that aims to identify the reason for problematic behaviors and replace them with more appropriate behaviors, pivotal response treatment (PRT) focusing on such important areas of development as motivation or self-management, discrete trial training (DTT) using a very systematic and step-by-step approach, natural environment training (NET) which takes place in a familiar setting, and early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) for very young children.aripiprazole: A medication used to treat irritability related to autism in some children ages 6 to 17.Asperger's disorder, or Asperger's syndrome: The name formerly used for a type of pervasive developmental disorder marked by difficulty with social interactions, obsessive interests, a monotonous or rigid voice, and often unusual, repetitive behaviors. Most people with these symptoms are now considered to have autism spectrum disorder, although anyone previously diagnosed with Asperger's may still identify with the term.autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or autism: A brain disorder marked by problems with communication, social interaction, and restricted, repetitive behaviors or interests. Restricted, repetitive behaviors may include constant twirling, hand flapping, or being focused on one topic or activity  lining up toys in a particular order or being obsessed with trains, for example. People with autism also may be especially sensitive to noise, bright lights, or touch. Signs of autism must be apparent from a young age, even if they aren't recognized until later. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may be associated with other health conditions or intellectual or language disabilities. There is no cure, but there are many treatment approaches and therapies that can help people with autism. There are no drugs to treat autism, either, but medication may ease common symptoms such as aggressive behavior, tantrums, anxiety, depression, and irritability.cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): A therapy approach that aims to help people recognize and manage their emotions and moods, leading to improved behavior. It's often used to help reduce anxiety and fear, particularly in high-functioning children.complementary and alternative therapy: These are unconventional treatments and therapies that aren't typically recommended by most doctors. Examples include dietary changes (like eliminating casein and gluten from a child's diet), melatonin to ease insomnia, nutritional supplements (such as multivitamins), oxygen treatments, compression vests, and chelation therapy, which claims to remove certain chemicals from the body. These methods are generally unproven, and some may be dangerous.Developmental, Individual Difference, Relationship-based (DIR)/Floortime Model: An intervention approach that involves following and encouraging children's natural interests to meet developmental milestones.Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM): The American Psychiatric Association's standard reference guide used to define autism and other conditions that affect the brain. The 5th edition  DSM-5  published in 2013 changed the way autism is diagnosed. Four disorders (autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified) were eliminated from the previous edition and replaced with one diagnosis: autism spectrum disorder, with three levels of severity. DSM-5 also created a new diagnosis  social communication disorder. This condition includes some people who don't meet all the new criteria for an ASD diagnosis but have problems with communication.Early Intervention Services (EI): Free, federally funded state services for children younger than 3 who have, or are likely to have, a developmental delay. Each child has an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) describing the child's needs and services, which may include some of the behavioral and physical therapies described in this list.Early Start Denver Model (ESDM): A behavioral early intervention approach for children as young as 12 months old through preschool age to improve social skills. Usually provided in familiar, comfortable settings, such as at home or preschool, it emphasizes relationships: Therapy techniques are used during playtime, and parents are essential partners in modifying their child's behavior.Extended School Year (ESY) Services: Treatment and support services provided during long school breaks, such as summer break or winter holidays, to avoid regression in skills.504 plan: An educational plan to help public school students with physical or mental impairments function in a regular classroom. The 504 plan is legislated under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a federal civil rights statute. Children who aren't eligible for an individualized education program (IEP) may qualify instead for a 504 plan, which is overseen by teachers and has less parent involvement than an IEP.Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE): Federal law requires public schools to provide free educational services and support tailored to meet the individual needs of disabled children so that their educational experience is comparable to that of classmates who don't have a disability. FAPE falls under the 504 plan.Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA): A federal law that ensures public schools meet the educational needs of disabled students. It spells out special education services for children with disabilities including autism, learning disabilities, and speech or language impairment.Individualized Education Program (IEP): A detailed, written plan, worked out among parents, educators, and therapists, to educate and support a child with special needs between the ages of 3 and 21. It requires reevaluation every three years, though parents can request annual reevaluations.Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP): An early intervention treatment plan for children younger than 3 who have  or are likely to have  a developmental delay. It spells out the child's needs and services, which may include behavioral and physical therapy and must be provided free of charge.joint attention: A child's ability to share attention and interests with other people by pointing to something or showing an object, or by using eye contact and other cues, like smiling or clapping.least restrictive environment (LRE): Under IDEA, schools must include children with disabilities in regular classroom activities as much as possible. Students may need assistance in the classroom, such as physical accommodations or an aide. This is sometimes known as ""mainstreaming"" or ""inclusion.""nutritional therapy: A strategy usually developed with a registered dietitian or nutritionist to ensure children get enough nutrients and calories for healthy development. A customized meal plan can help address problems caused by food aversions, constipation, and side effects of medication. It can also help with digestive problems, a common issue in children with autism.occupational therapy (OT): Teaches practical skills for everyday life, such as bathing, getting dressed, eating, staying safe, and managing routine social interactions. It also helps children with hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills needed to write or grasp toys, and strategies for positive behavior. It often involves sensory integration therapy as well.pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS): In the DSM-4, children who were on the autism spectrum but didn't meet all the criteria for any specific subtype were diagnosed with PPD-NOS. DSM-5 eliminated PDD-NOS, folding it into autism spectrum disorder, but anyone with a previous PDD-NOS diagnosis may still identify with the term.physical therapy (PT): Strategies to help with movement and motion, such as toe-walking, repetitive movements, weak muscles, and difficulty planning and carrying out actions. PT also improves motor skills such as balance, coordination, and walking.risperidone: An antipsychotic medication for children ages 5 to 16 to help manage irritability, tantrums, self-harm, and aggression  behavior problems found in some children with autism spectrum disorder.sensory integration therapy: Helps children who are very sensitive to certain sensory experiences, such as sound, touch, sights, or smells, by teaching them ways to regulate and control their reaction.

"Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and gluten sensitivity in kids",https://www.babycenter.com/0_celiac-disease-wheat-allergy-and-gluten-sensitivity-in-kids_10403347.bc,"What is celiac disease?Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the digestive system. If your child has celiac disease, his immune system reacts to gluten  a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley  by attacking the lining of his small intestine. As a result, his body is unable to absorb nutrients from the food that passes through the damaged small intestine, and he may become malnourished.Celiac symptoms can appear as early as 6 months of age, after you start introducing your baby to solid foods that contain gluten. But it's quite rare for young children to have symptoms and most don't get diagnosed until later in childhood, often after age 10. Symptoms vary widely from one child to another, and can include chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, poop that's oily or smells especially bad, gassiness, irritability, vomiting, weight loss or trouble gaining weight, and delayed growth. Some children may not show any signs at all.If your child has been diagnosed with celiac disease, you'll need to make sure that he avoids all foods containing gluten. Unfortunately, people don't outgrow celiac disease  your child will need to be on a strict gluten-free diet for his entire life. The good news is that after eliminating gluten, his symptoms should start to disappear, and his small intestine should heal within a few months.About 3 to 13 in 1,000 children have celiac disease. About 1 percent of people in the United States have been diagnosed with this condition, although many people go undiagnosed. Scientists believe that the disease is becoming more common. Celiac disease tends to run in families, so it's important for parents and siblings of a diagnosed child to be screened as well.If left untreated, children with celiac disease can develop complications such as iron-deficiency anemia, malnutrition, weakened bones, and short stature. There's a higher chance of developing other autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes and Hashimoto's disease. There may also be a higher risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.People with certain genetic diseases such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and Williams syndrome are at higher risk of developing celiac disease.How is celiac disease different from gluten sensitivity or wheat allergy?Celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy are often confused with one another, because they all involve an intolerance of wheat proteins, and many of the symptoms look alike. But they're very different conditions that are diagnosed and managed in distinct ways.Celiac disease is a serious but treatable autoimmune disorder. As long as your child completely avoids gluten, she shouldn't experience any symptoms or damage to her small intestine.Wheat allergy involves a different part of the immune system. If your child has a wheat allergy, her immune system has identified wheat proteins as an allergen. Whenever a child eats foods or breathes in substances that contain wheat, she has an allergic reaction that causes her body to release histamines. You may notice classic food allergy symptoms, such as hives, swelling or itching of the lips, rash, itching, wheezing, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms appear within minutes or hours, and in some cases, can quickly become life threatening.Unlike kids with celiac disease, many children with a wheat allergy can tolerate other grains like rye and barley. So it's a bit easier to follow a wheat-free diet than a strict gluten-free diet. (Be sure to talk with your child's allergist about the foods your child can safely eat.) Like celiac disease, wheat allergy runs in families, but most children outgrow it by the time they're 18. Fewer than 1 percent of children have a wheat allergy.Gluten sensitivity, also called non-celiac gluten sensitivity or gluten intolerance, isn't a food allergy or an autoimmune disease. Researchers are just beginning to learn about this newly recognized condition, which may affect up to 6 percent of the population. People with gluten sensitivity have symptoms similar to those of celiac disease, and the symptoms improve once they begin a gluten-free diet.However, unlike celiac patients, people with gluten sensitivity seem to have no problems absorbing nutrients and should suffer no damage to their small intestine. Their blood also lacks the antibodies found in people with celiac disease. Unlike celiac disease, gluten sensitivity doesn't appear to be genetic, and so far scientists haven't found a link to autoimmune disorders or intestinal cancers.After eating foods with gluten, children with gluten sensitivity can have some of the same symptoms as kids with celiac disease  abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, and bloating  but they can also experience other symptoms, such as fatigue, headaches, and joint pain. Some may also have a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).Scientists aren't sure whether gluten is the true culprit behind gluten sensitivity. Several recent studies suggest it may be caused by foods that are high in a group of carbohydrates known by the acronym FODMAP (fermentable, oligo-, di-,mono-saccharides, and polyols). These carbs  which include dairy, wheat, beans, and certain sweeteners, fruits, and veggies  tend to be hard to digest and may ferment in the gut and cause abdominal distress in people who are sensitive to them.It's unclear whether people with gluten sensitivity need to avoid gluten as strictly as people with celiac disease. While research continues, experts recommend that gluten sensitivity patients work closely with their doctor and dietitian to develop a personalized food plan that helps them stay symptom-free. How can I tell if my child has celiac disease, wheat allergy, or gluten sensitivity?Diagnosis can be tricky, since these conditions have similar symptoms. It's essential to have your child evaluated by a doctor. There are major differences in how these conditions progress and are treated, so it's important to know exactly what you're dealing with.Your pediatrician will do a physical exam, ask questions about symptoms and your family medical history, and may order blood tests. For the blood tests to be accurate, make sure that your child continues to eat as he normally does. Don't eliminate foods that contain gluten or wheat unless your doctor specifically asks you to.If your pediatrician suspects a wheat allergy, she'll refer you to an allergist, who will do a skin prick test, blood tests, or a food challenge. Your child might be asked to eat a small amount of wheat under medical supervision and be observed for an allergic reaction.If your pediatrician suspects a gluten problem, she'll refer you to a pediatric gastroenterologist. This doctor may order more blood tests and do an endoscopy, passing a long, thin tube through the mouth and stomach into the small intestine and taking a tiny sample of tissue. If the sample reveals damage to the small intestine, your child will be diagnosed with celiac disease.Gluten sensitivity is more difficult to diagnose. Currently, there aren't any tests available. If your child shows symptoms that suggest a gluten issue but wheat allergy and celiac disease have been ruled out, your doctors may suspect gluten sensitivity. Your gastroenterologist may recommend trying a gluten-free or low-FODMAP diet plan. If your child's symptoms improve, the conclusion is probably gluten sensitivity.You may be tempted to avoid an endoscopy and just go gluten-free if you suspect that your child has celiac disease. But it's crucial to get a diagnosis first. If your child does have celiac disease, you'll need help managing his diet safely and his doctor will need to monitor intestinal damage and bone loss.How can I make sure my child has a gluten-free diet?Diagnosis can be a relief, but for many families, going gluten-free is a big lifestyle change. Grocery shopping, managing a gluten-free household, and eating out can all feel daunting, but there are some good guidelines and resources for parents.Work closely with your doctor and dietitian to develop a food plan before making any changes to your child's diet. Gluten-free diets are a popular trend, but just because a food is gluten-free does not mean it's healthy. It's important to make sure your child doesn't miss out on any essential nutrients. Your dietitian can help you develop a nutritious eating plan that fits your budget and lifestyle, and can also give you recipes and suggest substitutes for your child's favorite foods.The goal is to stay away from wheat, rye, and barley, as well as additives that may contain gluten. Most pastas, pizza, crackers, cereals, breads, and baked goods are made using these grains.Learn to read food labels. When you're shopping, check ingredients and avoid any products that include gluten-containing grains, for example:Wheat and wheat varieties such as spelt, kamut, durum, graham, and semolinaWheat bran, wheat starch, wheat germ, cracked wheat, hydrolyzed wheat proteinBarleyRyeTriticaleMalt (unless it's derived from corn)Oats are naturally gluten-free, but many oat products are contaminated with gluten during processing. So its worth experimenting with oats that are labeled gluten-free, but be aware that researchers have found that that some celiac patients cant tolerate even those oat products.Be wary of prepared and processed foods. Gluten can be found lurking in unexpected places, such as store-bought stews and soups, soy sauce, processed meats like hot dogs and cold cuts, salad dressings, medications, vitamins, and even lip balms.Resist the urge to stock your kitchen with manufactured products. Gluten-free bread, cookies, and crackers tend to be more expensive and have added sugars, sodium, or fat to make them taste better. Whole foods such as meat and poultry, fish, fruit, vegetables, most dairy, and nuts are naturally gluten-free and healthier for your family.It's reasonably safe for your child to eat foods labeled ""gluten-free."" All products manufactured after August 5, 2014, that are marked ""gluten-free,"" ""without gluten,"" ""no gluten,"" or ""free of gluten"" must either be naturally gluten-free or have gluten levels of less than 20 ppm (parts per million) in order to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) current rules.A gluten level below 20 ppm is low enough to be tolerated by most celiac patients and is also the lowest level that can be detected using scientific tools. If you're not sure how much gluten is in a food product, don't let your child eat it.Some products labeled ""gluten-free"" may include a warning that the item was made in a facility that processes wheat products, raising the question of cross-contamination. But as long as the product has gluten levels lower than 20 ppm, it meets the FDA's requirements and should be safe to eat for most celiac patients. For more information on gluten-free labeling, visit the FDA's web page on this topic.Eating out is trickier, but with some planning, kids who can't have gluten or wheat can still enjoy restaurants or eat at the school cafeteria. Before visiting a restaurant, check online or call ahead to see whether they offer gluten-free options. If a menu states that something is gluten-free, the restaurant must comply with the FDA's definition. Check with your regional celiac support group to see whether they have a list of restaurants that offer gluten-free menus or dishes.For school lunches, ask the principal about your options. Public schools are required by law to make reasonable meal accommodations for celiac patients on a gluten-free diet or kids who are at risk of having a life-threatening allergic reaction to wheat. Your child's doctor will need to provide confirmation of her condition. If you don't trust the cafeteria, however, you might want to pack your child's lunch.As for birthday parties and playdates, your child might feel left out if she can't eat what others are enjoying. Talk to her beforehand, and provide a special meal and dessert for her. Most parents will understand.For a list of foods to eat and avoid, tips on gluten-free food preparation, and advice on dining out, see the Gluten-Free Diet Guide for Families, by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.Where can I get more information?GI Kids: Children's digestive health information for kids and parents, by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.Celiac Disease Foundation: Overviews of celiac disease and treatment, practical diet tips, and support programs for children and young adults with celiac disease.

Introducing solids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_introducing-solids_113.bc,"When should I introduce solid food to my baby?As long as your baby shows signs of readiness, your child's doctor may say you can start solids any time around 4 to 6 months. Until then, breast milk or formula provides all the calories and nourishment your baby needs  and can handle. Infants don't yet have the physical skills to swallow solid foods safely, and their digestive system simply isn't ready for solids until they're about 4 months old.(Note that there's some controversy on this topic.While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) section on breastfeeding recommends that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first six months, the AAP's nutrition section and guidelines for pediatricians recommend starting solids at 4 to 6 months.)How can I tell when my baby's ready for solid food?Your baby will give you clear signs when he's ready to move beyond a liquid diet. Cues to look for include:Head control. Your baby needs to be able to keep his head in a steady, upright position.Sitting well when supported. Your baby needs to be able to sit upright in an infant feeding seat or highchair to swallow well.Losing the ""extrusion reflex."" Your baby's mouth and tongue develop in sync with his digestive system. To start solids, he should be able to move food to the back of his mouth and swallow it, instead of using his tongue to push food out of his mouth.Significant weight gain. He may be ready to eat solids if he's doubled his birth weight, weighs at least 13 pounds, and is at least 4 months old.Curiosity about food. Your baby may begin eyeing or reaching for your food or may open his mouth if you offer him a spoonful.7 signs your baby is ready for solid foods Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:57Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:57Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Watch for these signs that usually indicate when babies are ready to try their first food. See all videosWhich solid foods should I feed my baby first?Each baby is different, so talk to your child's doctor about which solids to introduce and when. Most infants can start with any pureed single-ingredient food with no added salt or sugar. Although it's customary in many American families to start babies on infant cereal, there's no medical evidence showing that this offers any advantages or health benefits.If your baby is breastfed, the AAP suggests meat as a first food because the iron in beef, chicken, and turkey helps to replace her iron stores, which start to diminish at about 6 months of age. Other good first foods include pureed sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, bananas, peaches, and pears.What can I do to minimize the risk of food allergies?Traditional first foods, such as iron-fortified infant cereal, pureed veggies, fruits, and meats, don't typically cause allergic reactions, but observe your baby for signs of allergy, just in case.Once you've tried a few of these foods and your baby seems to be tolerating them well, you can introduce more allergenic foods, such as soy, eggs, wheat, fish, and peanut butter. According to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI), introducing allergenic foods around 4 to 6 months may actually help prevent the development of food allergies later on.Special precautions need to be taken with certain babies. If your child falls into any of the following categories, consult with your baby's doctor or an allergist to create a customized feeding plan before adding solids to your baby's diet:Your baby has a sibling with a peanut allergy.Your baby has moderate to severe eczema despite following a doctor's treatment plan.Your baby previously had an immediate allergic reaction to a new food or has been diagnosed with a food allergy.Your baby's blood test was positive for an allergy to a specific food.Guide to Firsts: Solid foodOur checklist helps you get ready to feed your baby.How should I introduce solid food to my baby?For your first few feedings, give him just 1 or 2 teaspoons of pureed solid food or infant cereal after nursing or bottle-feeding.Use a soft-tipped plastic spoon to feed your baby to avoid injuring his gums. Put a small amount of food on the tip of the spoon and offer it to him. If your baby doesn't seem very interested, just let him smell the food for now and try again another time.If you're feeding your baby ready-to-eat jars or pouches of baby food, put some into a small dish and feed him from that. (If you dip his feeding spoon into the jar, it's not a good idea to save the leftovers because bacteria from his mouth will now be in the jar.) Throw away any open baby food jars within a day or two of opening them.If you decide to start with cereal, give him 1 to 2 teaspoons of diluted infant cereal. Add breast milk or formula to a tiny pinch of cereal. It will be very runny at first, but as your baby starts to eat more solid foods, you can gradually thicken the consistency by using less liquid.How to introduce new foods to your baby Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:51Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:51Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosBegin with one daily feeding whenever your baby is not too tired, hungry, or cranky). Your baby may not eat much at first, but give him time to get used to the experience. Some babies need practice keeping food in their mouths and swallowing.Eventually you can start giving him more solid food until he's up to a few tablespoons a day, over two feedings.(Note that most parents start solids by spoon-feeding their baby infant cereal or purees. But some parents use an alternative technique known as baby-led weaning, in which you put large chunks of soft food directly on the highchair tray or table, and let your baby grasp the food and feed himself. See our article on baby-led weaning for guidelines on how this technique works.)See our age-by-age baby feeding guide to find out what you can expect next.How do I introduce each new food to my baby?Introduce solids gradually, one at a time. Offer your baby a new food a few times over the course of three to five days before trying another new food. This way you'll be able to tell if your baby has an allergic reaction to something.Although you want your baby to eat a wide variety of foods, it takes time for her to get used to each new taste and texture. And each baby will have individual food preferences, but in general, your baby could start the transition with pureed or semi-liquid food, then move on to strained or mashed food, and finally graduate to small pieces of finger foods.If your baby is moving on from cereal, offer a few tablespoons of vegetables or fruit in the same meal as a cereal feeding (or mix them together). All food should be very mushy  at this stage your baby will press the food against the top of her mouth before swallowing it.What are the signs of a food allergy?If your baby is allergic to a new food, you'll see signs of a reaction within a few minutes or hours. Most children with food allergies have mild reactions. If you notice hives, vomiting, or diarrhea, call your baby's doctor for advice.If you notice wheezing, difficulty breathing, or facial swelling (including the tongue and lips), your baby may be having a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.How can I tell when my baby is full?Your baby's appetite will vary from one feeding to the next, so a strict accounting of how much he's eaten isn't a reliable way to tell when he's had enough. Look for these signs that he's probably done:Leans back in his chairTurns his head away from foodStarts playing with the spoonRefuses to open up for the next bite (Sometimes a baby will keep his mouth closed because he hasn't yet finished with the first mouthful, so give him time to swallow.)Do I still need to give my baby breast milk or formula?Yes, breast milk or formula will still provide the majority of your baby's calories and nutrition until she's a year old. Both provide important vitamins, iron, and protein in a form that's easy to digest. Solid food can't replace the nutrients that breast milk or formula provides during that first year.See how much breast milk or formula babies need after starting solids.Solid food feeding tipsOffer sweets or savories in any order. Some parents may tell you to start with vegetables instead of fruits so your infant won't develop a taste for sweets. But babies are born with a preference for sweets, so you don't have to worry about introducing sweet or savory foods in any particular order.Feed cereal with a spoon only. Unless your baby's doctor asks you to, don't add cereal to his bottle  he could choke or end up gaining too much weight.Encourage adventurous eating. Don't leave any food off his menu simply because you don't like it.Give new foods time. If your baby turns away from a particular food, don't push. Try again in a week or so. He may never like sweet potatoes, or he may change his mind and end up loving them.Know the choking hazards. Don't give your baby foods that might make him choke.Watch for constipation. A baby's stool sometimes changes when his diet does. Although it's usually temporary, your baby may have constipation after introducing solids. If you notice that your baby is having less frequent bowel movements, or that his stools have become hard or dry and seem difficult to pass, let his doctor know. Some doctors recommend adding high-fiber fruits such as pears, prunes, and peaches to a baby's diet, or giving him a few ounces of prune, apple, or pear juice each day until his bowel movements are back to normal.Also, don't be surprised if your baby's stools change color and odor when you add solids to his diet. If your baby has been exclusively breastfed up to this point, you'll probably notice a strong odor to his formerly mild-smelling stools as soon as he starts eating even tiny amounts of solids. This is normal.How many times a day should my baby eat solid food?At first she'll eat solid food just once a day. By around 6 to 7 months, two meals a day is the norm. Starting around 8 to 9 months, she may be eating solid food three times a day. A typical day's diet at 8 months might include a combination of:Breast milk or iron-fortified formulaIron-fortified cerealVegetablesFruitSmall amounts of protein, such as eggs, cheese, yogurt, poultry, lentils, tofu, and meatThere are certain foods that you shouldn't give your baby yet. Honey, for example, can cause botulism in babies less than a year old. And babies should wait until after their first birthday to try cow's milk or soy milk.What equipment do I need to feed solids to my baby?It's helpful to have:A highchairPlastic dishes and bowlsPlastic spoons to protect your baby's sensitive gumsBibsA splat mat on the floorYou may also want to introduce your baby to a sippy cup soon after you start solids.What do I need to make homemade baby food?If you're making your own baby food, you'll need:A tool to puree the food, like a blender, food processor, or baby food grinderStorage containers for refrigerating and freezing extra portions (Some parents use ice cube trays  or similar devices made just for baby food  to store and freeze individual portions.)Where should I feed solids to my baby?You'll want a sturdy, stable, comfy place for him to sit, at a convenient height for you. To start out, that might be a bouncy seat or even a car seat. (Just make sure that he's upright enough to swallow well.)However, once he can sit up by himself, a highchair at the table is your best bet. That way, your baby can be a part of family meals, and you'll be able to eat and feed him at the same time. It's also easier to clean up after he chows down.How can I help my child develop healthy eating habits?Don't feel like you have to stick to bland, boring baby foods  get ideas for more adventurous options to give your child, or learn how to make your own baby food.See our new rules for feeding your baby and the old guidelines that still apply.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012.

Postpartum back pain: How to get relief,https://www.babycenter.com/0_postpartum-back-pain-how-to-get-relief_1152191.bc,"Why does my back hurt so much after giving birth?Many of the physical changes that can cause low back pain during pregnancy may contribute to an achy back now, especially if you've given birth very recently. Other factors come into play during the postpartum period too.During pregnancy, your expanding uterus stretches and weakens your abdominal muscles and alters your posture, putting strain on your back. Plus, extra weight means more work for your muscles and increased stress on your joints.What's more, hormonal changes in pregnancy can loosen the joints and the ligaments that attach your pelvic bones to your spine, which can make you feel less stable and cause pain when you walk, stand, sit for long periods, roll over in bed, get out of a low chair or the tub, bend, or lift things.These changes don't go away overnight. So your back may continue to ache until your muscles regain their strength and tone and your joints become less lax.Postpartum exercises: Reducing backaches and strains Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 5:46Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -5:46Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

This step-by-step video will show you how to reduce backaches and tone your post-baby body. See all baby videosYou can also end up with a sore back as the result of a long or difficult labor. During labor you may have used muscles you don't normally use, and you'll feel the effects for some time. (If you had an epidural, you may notice some tenderness at the site for a few days after giving birth, but it shouldn't cause back pain.)Also, many new moms inadvertently make their back problems worse by not being conscious of good posture while feeding their baby. For example, when you're learning how to breastfeed you may be so focused on getting your baby to latch on correctly that you end up sitting hunched over, straining your neck and upper back muscles as you look down.The overall exhaustion and stress you may experience taking care of a newborn 24/7 can also make it harder to recover from aches and pains after childbirth, including back pain.How long will it last?It's common to have some back pain after giving birth. It usually resolves within a few months, though some women will continue to have pain for much longerWomen who had back pain before or during pregnancy are more likely to have persistent back pain after pregnancy, particularly if their pain was severe or began relatively early in pregnancy. Being overweight increases the risk too.What can I do about it?Begin a gradual exercise program:While you may not be eager to be up and about if your back hurts, moving around may be just what your body needs. Exercises to strengthen your abdominal muscles and increase flexibility may be helpful too.Choose a gentle form of exercise, such as walking. Walking is safe to start almost immediately after either a vaginal birth or a cesarean section. Take it slowly and keep walks short in the first few weeks. (Swimming, which helps strengthen your muscles without putting undue stress on your joints, is another good option later on.)Read more about starting to exercise.When your caregiver has given you the go-ahead, gradually start doing strengthening exercises for your back and abdominal muscles. Make pelvic tilts a part of your daily routine:Lie on your back with your knees bent and your feet flat on the floor. Inhale and allow your belly to expand with your breath. Exhale and tilt your tailbone toward your belly button while keeping your hips on the floor. (It's a subtle movement.) At the top of the tilt, tighten your buttocks, then release. Repeat eight to ten times. (Note: If you've had a c-section, wait at least six to eight weeks to start exercises like this.)Postpartum exercises: Improving posture and balance Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 5:34Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -5:34Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

These postpartum exercises will help you improve your posture and get back in shape. See all baby videosDo gentle stretching exercises or yoga. Avoid overstretching or extreme positions.Listen to your body. If a particular position or activity causes you discomfort, stop.Be aware of positioning and proper body mechanics:How you hold your body  as you carry and feed your baby, for example  will surely affect how your back feels. A few things to keep in mind throughout the day:Pay attention to your posture and stand up straight.Sit up straight, too. Think about your posture when feeding your baby, whether you're nursing or bottle-feeding. If you have low back pain, try using a footstool to keep your feet slightly raised off the floor. Choose a comfortable chair with armrests, and use lots of pillows to give extra support to your back and arms.Learn how to position yourself properly while nursing, and always bring your baby to your breast, rather than the other way around. Also try different breastfeeding positions. If you have tense shoulders and upper back pain, the side-lying position may be most comfortable.Always bend from your knees and lift objects and children from a crouching position to minimize the stress on your back. Let someone else lift heavy objects  this isn't the time to risk throwing your back out. (If you've had a c-section, you shouldn't be lifting anything heavier than your baby for at least eight weeks.) Try some TLC:Easing soreness and tension and generally taking good care of yourself may help you heal. At the very least, it'll help you feel better temporarily. Take the time to try these measures:Enjoy a warm bath  it may help relax your muscles and the rest of you, too.Wrap a heating pad or hot pack around the affected area. (Some research suggests that it may provide a bit of short-term relief.)If heat doesn't help, you might want to try a cold pack. Although there's no hard evidence that cold helps, it's easy to do, and there's no downside to trying. (Whether you use a hot pack or a cold one, cover it to protect your skin.)Treat yourself to a massage. It won't address the underlying source of your back pain, but it will help you relax and can temporarily soothe pulled muscles, tense shoulders, and lower back pain. If paying for a massage will strain your finances, try to enlist your partner or a friend to give you a rubdown.Learn relaxation techniques. They may help you cope with the discomfort and can be especially useful at bedtime.By the way, don't forget to pay attention to your diet. Good nutrition will help your body heal faster, and a healthy diet  combined with exercise  is the ticket to losing any extra pounds that may be causing additional stress on your joints and back.Are there other things to try if the above measures don't help enough?Yes, but begin by letting your caregiver know if your back pain doesn't respond to the self-care measures above. She can evaluate your situation, discuss treatment options, and refer you to a specialist, if necessary.Other options you might want to consider:Ibuprofen or acetaminophen may offer some temporary relief. Don't take more than recommended, and if you find you need them more than occasionally or they're not helping, talk to your caregiver. She may prescribe other medication as a short-term measure. (Let her know if you're breastfeeding.)Read more about drug safety during breastfeeding.Some back pain sufferers respond well to physical therapy. Plus, a physical therapist can teach you exercises to do on your own that will help prevent later episodes of low back pain.There's some evidence that acupuncture may be helpful in providing pain relief.Some women find that chiropractic care is helpful.What symptoms should prompt an urgent call to my caregiver?Call your caregiver immediately if:Your back pain is severe, constant, or getting progressively worse, or if it's caused by trauma or accompanied by a fever.You've lost feeling in one or both legs, or you suddenly feel uncoordinated or weak.You have a loss of sensation in your buttocks, groin, genital area, or your bladder or anus, which may make it hard to pee or have a bowel movement or, alternatively, cause incontinence.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2007.

Stomach flu (gastroenteritis),https://www.babycenter.com/0_stomach-flu-gastroenteritis_1190017.bc,"What is stomach flu?Stomach flu, or gastroenteritis, is an inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract. Despite the name, it's not caused by the influenza virus. The most common culprit is one of a number of other viruses, including rotavirus, adenovirus, calicivirus, and astrovirus.But gastroenteritis can also be caused by a potentially more serious bacterial infection, such as Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, Campylobacter, or E. coli. Still other cases are caused by parasites such as giardia.If your baby has gastroenteritis, she may have diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, chills, and achiness. Her symptoms may be mild or severe, and they may last for just a few hours or for days, depending on the culprit.How did my baby get stomach flu?Viral gastroenteritis is very contagious. Your baby may have eaten something contaminated with the virus or shared a cup or utensils with someone who has the virus. (It's possible to have the virus without showing symptoms.)If bacteria or a parasite is to blame, your child may have ingested contaminated food or drinking water.Another way your baby may have picked up the illness is by coming in contact with infected fecal matter and then putting her hands in her mouth. This sounds gross, but it happens a lot, especially in daycare situations. Remember that germs are microscopic, so even when a child's hands don't look dirty, they may be covered with bacteria.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.How common is stomach flu?Viral gastroenteritis is the second most common illness in the United States after upper respiratory infections such as colds. Most babies will come down with the stomach flu at least twice a year, more often if they're in daycare. Kids often enjoy a boost in their immunity after they turn 3 years old and may not contract it as often.When should I call my child's doctor?Give the doctor a call as soon as you suspect that your baby has gastroenteritis. Also call if your baby has been vomiting for more than two days or has blood in her stool, or you think she's excessively fussy.Use your doctor's guidelines for phoning in the event of a fever. (Common suggestions are fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit if your baby's less than 3 months old; a fever of 101 degrees F if she's between 3 and 6 months old; and a fever of 103 degrees F or higher if she's 6 months or older.)Also call your doctor if your baby shows any of the classic signs of dehydration:decreased urination (more than six hours without a wet diaper)excessive sleepiness or fussinessa sunken soft spotwrinkled skinsunken eyesextreme thirstdry lipscrying without tearscool, discolored hands and feetIf your baby appears dehydrated and no doctor is available, take her to the emergency room.If your baby is in danger of dehydration, the doctor might recommend IV rehydration. He may want to admit her to the hospital or just keep her there for a few hours.If a blood or stool test reveals that your child has a parasitic or bacterial infection, she may also be given a course of antibiotics. Don't be alarmed. Odds are, she'll be released and back to her healthy self within a few days. How should I treat stomach flu?First, you'll want to call your baby's doctor and tell her what's going on, especially if your child is under 6 months.If your baby has a bacterial infection, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Medication won't be helpful for a case of viral gastroenteritis, though, which like all viral infections just has to run its course. Don't give your child anti-diarrhea medication  it'll just prolong her illness and can have potentially serious side effects.If your child has a fever and seems uncomfortable, ask your doctor about giving her the appropriate dose of infant acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Never give your child aspirin, which is associated with Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal illness.Dehydration is a concern whenever a child is losing fluid, whether it's through vomiting, diarrhea, or a fever.Depending on how much she's vomiting and whether she's able to keep down any liquids, the doctor may recommend giving her an over-the-counter oral electrolyte solution, such as Pedialyte, Rehydralyte, or Enfalyte. These solutions help replace lost fluids, minerals, and salts. The doctor can let you know how much your baby should be drinking based on her age and weight.If your child isn't able to keep down formula or breast milk, the doctor may advise you to give her small sips of the electrolyte solution throughout the day, until she's able to keep that down, and then slowly go back to her normal diet.While you're trying to keep your baby hydrated, stay away from high-sugar foods like juices, sodas, and Jell-O, which can make stomach flu symptoms worse. (Gastroenteritis can temporarily damage the lining of the small intestine, making it difficult to digest these sweet foods.)If your baby is eating solids and has a relatively mild case of gastroenteritis  say, mild diarrhea but no vomiting  she can continue to eat modest amounts throughout the course of her illness and probably won't require oral electrolyte solution. Breastfeeding or formula feeding should be enough to keep her hydrated. When can my baby go back to eating solids?Talk with the doctor and follow your baby's cues. She may be able to continue eating almost normally, or it may be better to keep her off solid foods for a couple of days.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children with gastroenteritis resume a normal diet (staying away from fatty foods) as soon as possible. That includes such staples as complex carbohydrates (whole-grain breads and cereals), lean meats, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables.Take note that this menu is different from the diet doctors used to prescribe. ""The BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) was once very commonly advocated, but we no longer recommend it because it lacks protein and other vital nutrients,"" says William John Cochran, associate professor of pediatrics at the Geisinger Clinic in Danville, Pennsylvania.Studies show that reintroducing a standard diet soon after acute symptoms ease can actually shorten a child's bout of gastroenteritis by half a day because it restores nutrients to the system that are necessary to fight infection. On the other hand, if the bug kills your baby's appetite and she misses a few days of good nutrition, don't worry. As long as she stays hydrated, she'll be fine.How can I help protect my baby against gastroenteritis?Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after every diaper change and bathroom visit and before preparing or eating food. The same goes for other family members and daycare staff. It's also a good idea to wash your baby's hands often throughout the day.What's more, be sure to follow safe food preparation and cooking practices.To prevent your child from getting rotavirus (which can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, especially in babies and young children), your baby should receive three doses of the rotavirus vaccine: one at 2 months, another at 4 months, and the last at 6 months.Show sources Hide sources AAP.

Cow's milk: When and how to introduce it,https://www.babycenter.com/0_cows-milk-when-and-how-to-introduce-it_1334703.bc,"Why should I wait until my baby is at least 12 months old to introduce cow's milk?Babies can't digest cow's milk as completely or easily as breast milk or formula. Cow's milk contains high concentrations of protein and minerals, which can tax your baby's immature kidneys.Cow's milk doesn't have the right amounts of iron, vitamin C, and other nutrients for infants. It may even cause iron-deficiency anemia in some babies, since cow's milk protein can irritate the lining of the digestive system, leading to blood in the stools. Finally, cow's milk doesn't provide the healthiest types of fat for growing babies.However, once your child's ready to digest it, dairy milk can supplement a balanced diet of solid foods that include cereals, vegetables, fruits and meats.Why should my child start drinking cow's milk?Milk is a rich source of calcium, which builds strong bones and teeth and helps regulate blood clotting and muscle control. It's also one of the few sources of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium and is crucial for bone growth. (Almost all milk in the United States is fortified with vitamin D.)Milk also provides protein for growth, and carbohydrates to give your child the energy he needs all day. And if your child gets enough calcium from the get-go, there's evidence that he'll have a lower risk of high blood pressure, stroke, colon cancer, and hip fractures later in life.Feeding timeline: Your child's development Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:14Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:14Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all baby videosDo I need to stop breastfeeding when my child starts drinking cow's milk?There's no need to wean your child after you introduce cow's milk. As long as you both enjoy breastfeeding, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says it's fine to continue breastfeeding past your child's first birthday.How much milk should my toddler drink?According to the AAP, your 1-year-old can get enough calcium and vitamin D from 8 to 12 ounces (1 to 1 1/2 cups) of cow's milk  or the equivalent amount of other milk products, like yogurt or cheese. By age 2, your child should get 16 ounces, or 2 cups, of cow's milk or other milk products each day.However, don't give your child more than 32 ounces (4 cups) of milk a day or she may not have room for the other foods she needs to round out her diet. If your toddler's still thirsty, offer water. Can I give my toddler fat-free or reduced-fat milk?In most cases, not yet. The AAP recommends giving whole milk to 1-year-olds unless they're at high risk for obesity. Children this age need the higher fat content of whole milk to maintain normal weight gain and to help the body absorb vitamins A and D. The concentration of protein and minerals in nonfat milk is also too high for children this age. Once your child turns 2, you may decide to switch him to reduced-fat or nonfat milk as long as he's growing well.Possible exceptions: Your child's doctor may recommend giving your child reduced-fat milk (2 percent) after age 1 if you're overweight or obese, or have a family history of obesity, high cholesterol, or cardiovascular disease.My toddler doesn't seem to want cow's milk. How can I get her to try it?Some toddlers take to cow's milk right away, but others are hesitant to make the switch because it has a different texture, taste, and even temperature than breast milk.If that's the case for your toddler, try mixing cow's milk with some breast milk or formula at first. (Try one part milk to three parts of breast milk or formula.) Then slowly shift the ratio until she's drinking 100 percent milk. It may also help to serve cow's milk at room temperature.It can be a challenge to meet the nutritional recommendations for milk or milk products if your child doesn't care for them. But there are many ways to include these in your child's diet. For example:Add milk to her cereal.Serve yogurt, cottage cheese, pudding, custard, or shakes for snacks.Make soup with milk instead of water.Add a milk-based sauce or gravy to casseroles.What if my child can't tolerate milk or can't have it because we're vegans?Regardless of the reason your child doesn't get calcium and vitamin D from milk and other dairy products, your pediatrician will probably recommend either fortified soy milk or calcium and vitamin D supplements.Should I buy organic or hormone-free milk for my child?There's no conclusive evidence that these kinds of milk are better for children, but there's no harm in them. (Organic milk does tend to be more expensive.) Read up on growth hormones in milk and organic foods to help you make a decision.However, the AAP warns against giving your child ""raw"" or unpasteurized milk, though. Without pasteurization, milk may contain harmful bacteria or parasites that can cause serious health problems.Could my child have a milk allergy?If your child drank cow's-milk-based formula as a baby without any problems, you can rest assured that he'll have no problem tolerating regular cow's milk. Even babies who were exclusively breastfed for the first year can usually handle regular cow's milk because they've been exposed to cow's milk protein in breast milk (unless you avoided all dairy).If your child drank soy formula because your doctor recommended it, check with your doctor before introducing cow's milk. Your doctor may recommend that you start with a soy beverage that's been fortified with vitamin D and calcium. (See what our experts say about giving soy milk or rice milk to a child who won't drink cow's milk.)If your child drank soy formula because your doctor recommended it, though, check with your doctor before introducing cow's milk. Your doctor may recommend that you start with a soy beverage that's been fortified with vitamin D and calcium. (See what our experts say about giving soy milk or rice milk to a child who won't drink cow's milk.)But true allergies to cow's milk are relatively uncommon: Only 2 to 3 percent of infants are allergic to milk, according to the AAP, and almost all of them outgrow it. (Learn the difference between a milk allergy and lactose intolerance.) The main symptoms of milk allergy are:Rashes or hives, especially around the mouth or chinAbdominal discomfortDiarrheaVomitingSwellingItchinessAnd chronic nasal stuffiness, a runny nose, cough, wheezing, or breathing difficulties could all be signs that a milk allergy is affecting your child's respiratory system. If your toddler develops any of these symptoms, talk with his doctor.Take your child to his healthcare provider or to the nearest emergency room immediately if he:Is extremely pale or weakHas hives all over his bodyDevelops swelling in the head or neckHas bloody diarrheaHe may be having a life-threatening allergic reaction.If it turns out that your toddler is allergic to cow's milk, you'll want to be careful to avoid foods such as cottage cheese, condensed or evaporated milk, ice cream, yogurt, margarine that contains milk, butter, milk chocolate, and powdered milk. Thanks to a law passed in 2004, all allergens must be clearly marked on food products. In this case, the label will say ""milk.""Learn more:10 nutrients every child needsShould I monitor how much fat my child eats?Best and worst drinks for thirsty kidsShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Chronic high blood pressure in pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_chronic-high-blood-pressure-in-pregnancy_1427404.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWhat is high blood pressure?Blood pressure refers to how hard blood pushes against the artery walls when your heart beats. A certain amount of pressure is necessary for blood to move around your body, but too much pressure can cause serious problems.Blood pressure is measured in millimeters of mercury (mmHg), and the measurement has two numbers: The top (systolic) number is the pressure when the heart contracts and pumps blood, and the bottom (diastolic) number is when the heart relaxes and fills with blood. When people talk about blood pressure readings, they say, ""120 over 80,"" for example.High blood pressure (hypertension) during pregnancy is defined as a reading of 140/90 or higher, even if just one number is elevated. Severe high blood pressure is 160/110 or higher.Most women with high blood pressure can have a normal pregnancy. But having high blood pressure during pregnancy makes it more likely that you and your baby will have certain complications.What is the difference between chronic high blood pressure and gestational hypertension?Sometimes it's hard to know whether you have chronic high blood pressure or gestational hypertension until after you deliver your baby. If you have high blood pressure before you're 20 weeks pregnant, it usually means you have chronic high blood pressure. This is a long-term type of high blood pressure that affects up to 5 percent of pregnant women.Gestational hypertension  also called pregnancy-induced hypertension  is high blood pressure that usually occurs for the first time at 20 weeks of pregnancy or later. Gestational hypertension is temporary and almost always goes away after childbirth.What are the risk factors for chronic high blood pressure?The risk factors that make chronic high blood pressure more likely include:Age (The older you are, the higher the risk.)Having a family history of high blood pressureBeing African AmericanHaving diabetes or kidney diseaseHaving had preeclampsia in a previous pregnancyBeing overweightBeing sedentarySmoking cigarettesEating too much saltDrinking more than two alcoholic drinks a dayPoor nutrition, especially a diet that lacks fruits and vegetablesSome risk factors can't be changed, such as your genes or having certain health conditions. But you can make changes to reduce other risk factors, and these are important to know about when you're trying to get pregnant.What are the symptoms of high blood pressure?High blood pressure doesn't usually cause any symptoms, so you may not be aware of it unless your blood pressure is measured. High blood pressure can sometimes cause:Severe headachesSevere anxietyShortness of breathNosebleedsHow is high blood pressure diagnosed?You'll have your blood pressure measured at each appointment during pregnancy. Your healthcare provider may also ask you to monitor your blood pressure at home.High blood pressure is diagnosed when either or both the systolic or diastolic blood pressure is at an unhealthy level. Because blood pressure varies throughout the day, your provider may take several readings at different times.A blood pressure reading of:Less than 120/80 is considered healthy blood pressure (normal)At least 120/80 but less than 140/90 is considered at risk for high blood pressure (prehypertension)At least 140/90 but less than 160/110 is mild high blood pressure (mild hypertension)160/110 and above is severe high blood pressure (severe hypertension)How does high blood pressure affect pregnancy?Many women with mild high blood pressure have a normal pregnancy. Blood pressure typically falls slightly early in pregnancy and then returns to pre-pregnancy levels in the third trimester.But the more severe high blood pressure is during pregnancy, the greater the risk of problems. There's also a greater risk of complications if you've had high blood pressure for a long time and it's damaged your heart, kidneys, or other organs. The risks are also higher for women with high blood pressure that's caused by another medical condition, such as diabetes or kidney disease.High blood pressure risks include:Preeclampsia: If high blood pressure develops after 20 weeks of pregnancy and you have protein in your urine, or if there are signs that certain organs aren't working properly (like your liver), this could signal a serious condition called preeclampsia. Preeclampsia that develops when you already have high blood pressure is called ""superimposed preeclampsia."" Between 13 and 40 percent of women with high blood pressure develop superimposed preeclampsia during pregnancy.Having a baby that's smaller than normal: High blood pressure can mean that your baby doesn't get all the necessary nutrients and grows more slowly than usual (intrauterine growth restriction or IUGR). The risk of a baby being born small depends on how severe your high blood pressure is and whether you have other complications, like anemia or kidney disease.Cesarean birth: Women with high blood pressure are at a higher risk of delivering by cesarean section (c-section), which is surgery that can lead to other complications. On average, about 4 out of 10 women with high blood pressure give birth by c-section.Placental abruption: In this condition, part or all of the placenta separates from the uterine wall before the baby is born. There are different degrees of placental abruption, and in severe cases, a baby may not get enough oxygen and need to be born right away. If high blood pressure is mild, the risk of placental abruption is low, affecting about 1 in 100 women. If high blood pressure is severe or preeclampsia develops, the risk increases to range from 5 to 10 percent.Preterm birth: If complications develop, or it looks like your baby isn't growing well, it may be necessary to deliver early. The more severe high blood pressure is, the more likely it is to need an early delivery. On average, 28 percent of women with high blood pressure have their baby before they're 37 weeks pregnant. Studies show between 62 and 70 percent of women with severe high blood pressure deliver early.What can I do to have a healthy pregnancy?Discuss your plans with your healthcare provider at a preconception visit. Some antihypertensive drugs, such as ACE inhibitors, raise a baby's risk of developmental problems if they're taken during pregnancy.But don't stop taking your blood pressure medication during pregnancy unless your provider tells you to. Your provider will look for alternative medications to help keep your blood pressure under control.If your high blood pressure is mild and you don't have other complications (such as diabetes or kidney disease), your provider may advise you to stop taking your blood pressure medication or to reduce the dose. Being off medication temporarily is unlikely to cause problems if your condition is mild, though it's possible you'll take medication again later in pregnancy.Whether high blood pressure is mild or severe, keep all your prenatal appointments, so your provider can monitor you and your baby and spot any problems, such as rising blood pressure, signs of preeclampsia, or poor fetal growth as early as possible.Also, try to maintain a healthy weight and diet. Talk to your provider about how much weight to gain during pregnancy.Ask your provider if it's safe to exercise. In most cases you can continue to exercise, though your provider may recommend modifying the types of activities you do.If you drink alcohol or smoke, it's important to stop to protect your health and your baby's.When should I call my healthcare provider?If you're checking your blood pressure at home, contact your provider if your blood pressure is above a certain level. Your provider can tell you what those levels should be and what to do if you go above them.Keep a daily kick count of your baby's movements, and let your provider know immediately if you notice any changes. Also call your provider right away if you have:A headache that's severe or doesn't go awaySwelling that increases dramatically over a few days. Some swelling during pregnancy is normal, but big changes are cause for concern.Vision changes, including double vision, blurriness, seeing spots or flashing lights, light sensitivity, or temporary loss of visionIntense pain or tenderness in the upper abdomenNausea or vomiting (other than morning sickness in early pregnancy)Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

Signs of a bad daycare center,https://www.babycenter.com/0_signs-of-a-bad-daycare-center_6066.bc,"Choosing childcare for your baby or toddler is one of the hardest decisions a parent has to face. And it pays to be picky. Daycare centers can run the gamut from outstanding to, well, much worse.Start making the rounds about six months before you'll need childcare (good centers fill up fast) and watch for the warning signs listed below. If you see any at a place you're considering, move on.A so-so reputationDon't hesitate to judge a center based on what you've heard from other parents. Ask for specifics, though, to make sure that negative comments apply to your situation and aren't something unique to a particular family and the center.Take a survey of neighbors and fellow parents at the park. Ask them: Is this a popular center? Do you know whether a child has ever been lost or injured at the center? If you're even the slightest bit reluctant to leave your child at a center, pass.Bottom line: If other parents aren't thrilled with the center, it's best to keep looking.  Childcare that works for usGrandma? Daycare? Real parents discuss finding childcare that works.Loose rulesRules and regulations are important. Centers without clearly established guidelines for everything from operating hours to handling emergencies are likely to have other organizational problems as well.Ask for a written copy of the center's policies. If they can't supply one, that's a reason to be wary.In-home daycare may be less formal and more flexible, but a good in-home daycare should still have a set schedule, safety policies, and a safe physical environment.Similarly, centers with a lax sick-child policy should be crossed off your list. If children and staff who come down with a fever or the flu don't have to stay home for at least 24 hours, your child is more likely to catch every little thing that comes along.The center should also require children and staff to have current immunizations and regular checkups. This policy is a good indication of how seriously the center will take your child's health and well-being.And if you run into a closed-door policy, keep looking. A center that balks at having parents drop by unannounced could have something to hide.Bottom line: If a daycare center doesn't have clear rules and organization, it's not likely to be the right place for you. Keep looking.A questionable curriculumSkip centers that either have no daily program or offer one that is static and unchallenging. Children need variety, change, and a chance to grow. The best centers offer a wide range of both group and individual activities.If babies spend most of their time in swings, infant seats, or other ""baby holders,"" if the center doesn't offer organized activities that change regularly, or if television and other electronic media are a big part of the day's agenda, cross the facility off your list.Also, take a peek into the art area  is it well stocked with supplies? Are there paintings and other projects on the walls?Feel free to ask the staff about the daily routine and also about special activities. Does the staff take children on outings? If so, do they do it in a way you consider safe? Do they celebrate holidays? Which ones? The answers can give you an idea of how attentive the staff is to planning and preparation.Don't linger at centers with a poor selection of age-appropriate toys. Having enough of the right playthings not only encourages your child's development by stimulating creative, imaginative play, but it may also help prevent kids from getting in too many tussles over who gets to play with what and when. Check that the toys don't have small parts that could choke a baby or toddler.Bottom line: Your child needs a wide range of safe, age-appropriate toys and activities to encourage development. If the center doesn't offer them, move on. An inadequate staffIf a center's employees seem underqualified, keep looking. A staff that isn't educated (ideally, at least two years of college with a background in early childhood development), responsible, enthusiastic, and prepared won't provide the best care for your child.Caregivers should also be trained in CPR and share your basic philosophies on issues such as sleep, discipline, and feeding.Watch how the staff interacts with the children in their care. Two sure signs of a less-than-ideal situation are caregivers who speak to children only in baby talk or who yell or speak harshly to them. And of course, if you ever see a staff member hit a child, leave immediately and report the incident to Child Protective Services.The National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC) evaluates daycare programs and awards them accreditation if they meet certain standards. Look for the ""torch""  the symbol of NAEYC approval  or ask the director of the daycare center if the center has applied for this accreditation. Among the qualifications necessary to earn NAEYC accreditation is implementing a curriculum that fosters all areas of a child's development: cognitive, emotional, language, physical, and social. NAEYC-accredited centers must also provide ongoing assessments of each child, promote good nutrition and health, and employ a qualified staff. (Search NAEYC's database of accredited centers.)NAEYC also sets staffing guidelines for centers:For babies, the ratio is one caregiver for every three children if a group has six infants, or one for every four if it has eight.For toddlers 12 to 28 months, the ratio is one to three for six children, and one to four for eight or more children. For children age 21 to 36 months, these same ratios expand to one to five for ten children, and one to six for a group of 12.For preschoolers 30 to 48 months, the ratio should be one to six for a group of 12 children, one to seven for a group of 14, one to eight for a group of 16, and one to nine for a group of 18.For 4- and 5-year-olds, the ratio should be one to eight for a group of 16 children, one to nine for a group of 18 children, and one to ten for a group of 20 children.Trust your instincts. When you tour the facility, watch carefully to see whether babies are tended to quickly when they cry or if the staff lets them wail.Watch older children as well. Are they listened to when they ask questions? Do they receive help when they need to go to the bathroom? Whether your child is going to receive the attention he needs should be one of your primary considerations. An undercompensated staffPoor staff benefits lead to high turnover. Ideally, your child will be cared for by the same familiar faces day after day.Of course, even the best centers sometimes find it hard to hire and keep dedicated employees. Most childcare workers are paid very little (usually just above minimum wage), and the demands of keeping up with several babies or toddlers each day can be wearying. But centers that don't offer vacation and health insurance are even less likely to have a loyal staff that will care for your child long-term.Bottom line: If the staff's training isn't adequate, and employees seem overworked or don't stick around very long, the center isn't for you.Dirty, unsafe facilitiesIf the center seems shabby and rundown, keep looking. Here's a quick checklist:Food preparation areas should be far from toilets and diaper-changing stations.Floors, walls, and the kitchen area should be clean.Heat, light, and ventilation should be adequate.Equipment should be well maintained.It's a red flag if you don't see staff washing their hands after every diaper change (and sanitizing the changing area) or if the center generally looks poorly kept. Pick up a few toys  how sticky are they? Is the play area well organized?Look for plenty of space, too. According to NAEYC, centers should have at least 35 square feet of indoor space per child and 75 square feet per child outside.Skip centers with safety problems:Toys and play equipment should be in good repair.Upstairs windows (if any) should be kept closed or covered with window guards.Medication and hazardous substances should be out of reach.Bedding should be fresh and firm to reduce the risk of SIDS (sudden infant death syndrome) for babies.The outdoor play area should be level and secure with impact-absorbing surfaces under swings and slides.Smoke detectors should be present and working.Radiators and heaters should be covered or otherwise protected.A first-aid kit and fire extinguisher should be close at hand, and poison control and ambulance phone numbers should be clearly posted.Fire drills should be held at least monthly.All standard childproofing devices should be in place (covered outlets, safety gates, door latches).Check the security at doors and outdoor gates  strangers shouldn't be able to just walk in off the street.Bottom line: If the center seems dingy, cramped, or dangerous, move on.An expired licenseIf a center's license is out of date, cross that place off your list. Many centers post their license prominently. If you don't see one, ask about it. You could also call your local social services department to check whether the facility has a current license.A license in itself doesn't guarantee quality care, but most states require proper credentials, so centers that don't have a license aren't fulfilling the most basic criteria.Daycare centers are also required to meet state licensing regulations for health and safety. And facilities that haven't passed the stringent accreditation process required by NAEYC (described above) may be questionable.Bottom line: A license isn't everything, but if a center doesn't have one, it's not for you.Read about Signs of a Good Daycare Center.Show sources Hide sources AAFP. 2010.

Uterine fibroids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_uterine-fibroids_7187.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWhat are fibroids?Fibroids are tumors that grow from muscle cells in the uterus. They're rarely cancerous but can sometimes cause symptoms like pain and bleeding and they may interfere with the ability to get pregnant. Fibroid are found in up to 10 percent of women during pregnancy and are most common in women aged 30 to 40.Doctors call fibroids leiomyomas or myomas of the uterus. Fibroids can grow on the outside or the inside the uterus, or in the tissue of the uterine wall.Fibroids can be as small as a raisin or as large as a grapefruit. A large fibroid or cluster of fibroids can change the shape of the uterus or put pressure on the bladder or intestine.Why do women get fibroids?No one knows for sure what causes fibroids. It's likely genetics and hormones are involved. For example, fibroids can grow more when estrogen and progesterone levels are high during pregnancy. And as a woman gets close to menopause and these hormones decline, fibroids can shrink or stop growing.Researchers don't know why, but fibroids are more common in African American women. Fibroids in these women develop at an earlier age and are more severe. By menopause, about 80 percent of African American women have had fibroids, compared with 70 percent of Caucasian women.Women with a family history of fibroids also have a higher risk of developing them. It's likely that inherited genes in these women increase the odds of having fibroids.What are the symptoms of fibroids?Most women have no symptoms and may never even know they have fibroids. In other women symptoms include:Heavy or prolonged bleeding during a period (may lead to iron deficiency, or anemia)Feeling of fullness, pain, or pressure in the lower abdomenPainful cramps during a periodMore frequent or uncomfortable urinationPain during sexConstipation or painful bowel movementsDifficulty getting pregnantHow are fibroids diagnosed?Most fibroids are found during routine pelvic exams. A doctor may suspect them if she notices that a woman has a lumpy or irregularly shaped uterus.If a woman has painful or recurring symptoms, the doctor may also do an ultrasound of the uterus and ovaries. Sometimes fibroids are found on a routing ultrasound exam during pregnancy. What's the treatment for fibroids?Most fibroids don't need to be treated, but your doctor may recommend it based on:Your discomfortBlood loss during your periodsHow quickly the fibroids growYour ageIf you do need treatment, you have several options, all with benefits and risks. The right treatment depends on such factors as your symptoms, your treatment goals, and whether you want to have children.Myomectomy.During a myomectomy, the doctor removes fibroids, but leaves the uterus in place. Myomectomy is generally recommended for women who have severe fibroid-related symptoms and those having trouble getting pregnant because of fibroids.A myomectomy can relieve symptoms and preserve (or even improve) fertility for some women. However, it can lead to scarring of the pelvis or uterus, which also affects fertility. Women who get pregnant after having a myomectomy may have an increased risk of uterine rupture during labor.Depending on the size, location, and number of fibroids, a provider might do the surgery through the cervix, using a laparoscope with thin instruments and a lighted microscope inserted through several small cuts in the abdomen, or through a larger cut in the lower abdomen.A woman still has a 30 percent chance of developing a new fibroid within 10 years of a myomectomy, especially if she had multiple tumors.Hysterectomy.With a hysterectomy, the doctor removes the entire uterus. The advantage of a hysterectomy is that fibroids can't grow back. But not having a uterus also means not being able to get pregnant.A hysterectomy used to be the standard treatment for fibroids because it stopped the heavy bleeding typically associated with them. It's now generally reserved for women who don't want to get pregnant, who have severe symptoms, or who are in menopause.Medication.Medications can lower estrogen levels to shrink or temporarily stop fibroids from growing, especially before surgery. However, these drugs can cause menopause-like symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and reduced bone density, so doctors prescribe the drugs for six months or less. After that, fibroids will probably grow again.Blocking the blood supply.Another technique is uterine artery embolization (UAE) or uterine fibroid embolization (UFE). In this procedure, a radiologist uses a thin tube (a catheter) to inject material into the arteries leading to the uterus. This blocks the blood supply, which ""starves"" and shrinks the fibroid.Since doctors aren't sure how UAE affects fertility, this treatment isn't recommended for women who want to have children.UAE is less invasive than a myomectomy or hysterectomy. (There's just one very small cut at the artery near the groin.) What are new treatments for fibroids?In recent years, doctors have developed several less invasive ways to treat fibroids. But these procedures aren't widely available, and they're not likely to be covered by insurance. They're still being evaluated for long-term health risks and benefits, and they aren't recommended for women who want to become pregnant.These aren't yet considered standard treatments, so if you decide to pursue one, have a detailed conversation with your doctor. Ask her how much experience she has with the procedure, and be sure you understand all the possible health risks.Focused ultrasound.One new procedure is focused ultrasonic treatment. In this procedure, an MRI is used to pinpoint the exact location of a fibroid. Then, high-energy ultrasound waves are focused on the fibroid, heating it and killing cells, causing the fibroid to shrink.To learn more about this procedure or find out whether it's available near you, visit theFocused Ultrasound Foundation's website.Thermal or freezing techniques.Another relatively new treatment is called myolysis. This involves laparoscopically inserting needle probes directly into a fibroid. Then an electric current or laser destroys it and the surrounding blood vessels using heat energy. A similar treatment called cryomyolysis works the same way except that it destroys the fibroid and blood supply by freezing them.What can I do to feel better if I have fibroids?If pain or bleeding during your period is caused by fibroids and is an ongoing or worsening problem, call your doctor. You may want to ask about birth control, which can help with symptoms such as heavy bleeding, cramps, and pain during your period.Here are some suggestions for easing pain immediately:Rest on a comfortable couch or in bed when you're in pain.Put a hot water bottle or heating pad on your abdomen.Ask your doctor about taking prescription or over-the-counter pain medication.To lower the risk of anemia caused by heavy bleeding during your period, eat foods high in iron, such as lean red meat and spinach, and take iron supplements if your doctor recommends them.Is it possible to prevent fibroids?No, there's no way to prevent fibroids from developing unless you have a hysterectomy.Some companies sell supplements and natural remedies that claim to prevent or eliminate fibroids, but your provider isn't likely to recommend these products. There's no evidence to show that nutrition has any effect on fibroids, and the safety of these products is unknown.Swap stories and advice about fibroids with other parents in the BabyCenter Community.Use the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicines Find an MFM Specialist tool to locate a high-risk pregnancy doctor near you.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2011.

How breastfeeding benefits you and your baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-breastfeeding-benefits-you-and-your-baby_8910.bc,"Breast milk is best for your baby, and the benefits of breastfeeding extend well beyond basic nutrition. In addition to containing all the vitamins and nutrients your baby needs in the first six months of life, breast milk is packed with disease-fighting substances that protect your baby from illness.That's one reason the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months (although any amount of breastfeeding is beneficial). And scientific studies have shown that breastfeeding is good for your health, too.Here's a look at some of the most important benefits breastfeeding offers you and your baby.Breastfeeding protects your baby from a long list of illnessesNumerous studies from around the world have shown that stomach viruses, lower respiratory illnesses, ear infections, and meningitis occur less often in breastfed babies and are less severe when they do happen. Exclusive breastfeeding (meaning no solid food, formula, or water) for at least six months seems to offer the most protection.Breastfeeding lessons learned: 5 things I never knew Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 6:21Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -6:21Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

A filmmaker and mother of two shares what she wants new moms to know. See all baby videosOne large study by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences showed that children who are breastfed have a 20 percent lower risk of dying between the ages of 28 days and 1 year than children who weren't breastfed, with longer breastfeeding associated with lower risk.The main immune factor at work here is a substance called secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) that's present in large amounts in colostrum, the first milk your body produces for your baby. (Secretory IgA is present in lower concentrations in mature breast milk.) The substance guards against invading germs by forming a protective layer on the mucous membranes in your baby's intestines, nose, and throat.Your breast milk is specifically tailored to your baby. Your body responds to pathogens (virus and bacteria) that are in your body and makes secretory IgA that's specific to those pathogens, creating protection for your baby based on whatever you're exposed to.Breastfeeding's protection against illness lasts beyond your baby's breastfeeding stage, too. Studies have shown that breastfeeding can reduce a child's risk of developing certain childhood cancers. Scientists don't know exactly how breast milk reduces the risk, but they think antibodies in breast milk may give a baby's immune system a boost.Breastfeeding may also help children avoid a host of diseases that strike later in life, such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and inflammatory bowel disease. In fact, preemies given breast milk as babies are less likely to have high blood pressure by the time they're teenagers.For babies who aren't breastfed, researchers have documented a link between lack of breastfeeding and later development of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.Breastfeeding can protect your baby from developing allergiesBabies who are fed a formula based on cow's milk or soy tend to have more allergic reactions than breastfed babies.Scientists think that immune factors such as secretory IgA (only available in breast milk) help prevent allergic reactions to food by providing a layer of protection to a baby's intestinal tract. Without this protection, inflammation can develop and the wall of the intestine can become ""leaky."" This allows undigested proteins to cross the gut where they can cause an allergic reaction and other health problems.Babies who are fed formula rather than breast milk don't get this layer of protection, so they're more vulnerable to inflammation, allergies, and other eventual health issues. Breastfeeding may boost your child's intelligenceVarious researchers have found a connection between breastfeeding and cognitive development. In a study of more than 17,000 infants followed from birth to 6 1/2 years, researchers concluded from IQ scores and other intelligence tests that prolonged and exclusive breastfeeding significantly improves cognitive development.Another study of almost 4,000 children showed that babies who were breastfed had significantly higher scores on a vocabulary test at 5 years of age than children who were not breastfed. And the scores were higher the longer they had been nursed.Preterm infants with extremely low birth weight who received breast milk shortly after birth improved their mental development scores at 18 months when compared with preterm infants who weren't given breast milk. In a later study, researchers found that the higher scores held at 30 months, and that the babies who received breast milk were also less likely to be hospitalized again because of respiratory infections.Experts say that the emotional bonding that takes place during breastfeeding probably contributes to some of the brainpower benefits, but that the fatty acids in breast milk may play the biggest role.Breastfeeding may protect your child from obesityThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding as a way to help reduce your child's risk of becoming overweight or obese. An analysis of 17 studies published in the American Journal of Epidemiology shows that breastfeeding reduces a child's risk of becoming overweight as a teen or adult. The strongest effect is in children who were exclusively breastfed, and the longer the baby was breastfed the stronger the link.Experts think that breastfeeding may affect later weight gain for several reasons:Breastfed babies are better at eating until their hunger is satisfied, leading to healthier eating patterns as they grow.Breast milk contains less insulin than formula. (Insulin stimulates the creation of fat.)Breastfed babies have more leptin in their system, a hormone that researchers believe plays a role in regulating appetite and fat.Compared with breastfed babies, formula-fed infants gain weight more rapidly in the first weeks of life. This rapid weight gain is associated with later obesity.Breastfeeding may lower your baby's risk of SIDSA large German study published in 2009 found that breastfeeding  either exclusively or partially  is associated with a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The researchers concluded that exclusive breastfeeding at 1 month of age cut the risk of SIDS in half.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends breastfeeding for as long as possible to reduce the risk of SIDS. Breastfeeding can reduce your stress level and your risk of postpartum depressionThe National Institutes of Health reviewed more than 9,000 study abstracts and concluded that women who didn't breastfeed or who stopped breastfeeding early on had a higher risk of postpartum depression.Many women report feeling relaxed while breastfeeding. That's because nursing triggers the release of the hormone oxytocin. Numerous studies in animals and humans have found that oxytocin promotes nurturing and relaxation. (Oxytocin released while nursing also helps your uterus contract after birth, resulting in less postpartum bleeding.)One study found that women who had high amounts of oxytocin in their system (50 percent of breastfeeding moms as opposed to 8 percent of bottle-feeding moms) had lower blood pressure after being asked to talk about a stressful personal problem.By the way, if you're being treated for depression, you can still breastfeed your baby. Your healthcare practitioner can help you identify safe ways to treat your depression while nursing.Breastfeeding may reduce your risk of some types of cancerNumerous studies have found that the longer women breastfeed, the more they're protected against breast and ovarian cancer. For breast cancer, nursing for at least a year appears to have the most protective effect.It's not entirely clear how breastfeeding helps, but it may have to do with the structural changes in breast tissue caused by breastfeeding and the fact that lactation suppresses the amount of estrogen your body produces. Researchers think the effect on ovarian cancer may be related to estrogen suppression as well.More informationStudies are finding new benefits of breastfeeding all the time. The May 2010 issue of Pediatrics, for example, published a study showing that babies who are breastfed are less likely to have fevers after their immunizations than babies who are formula fed.Breastfeeding is natural  but that doesn't necessarily mean it's easy. Don't hesitate to contact your healthcare provider or a certified lactation consultant if you need help or support.You can also get help from our Breastfeeding Problem Solver, ask questions in our Breastfeeding support and help group, and learn more about breastfeeding basics, including ways to hold your baby while breastfeeding.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a.

Twelve steps to a healthy pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_twelve-steps-to-a-healthy-pregnancy_9174.bc,"Now that you know you're pregnant, it's more important than ever to take care of yourself both physically and emotionally. You can boost your chances of having a problem-free pregnancy and a healthy baby by following a few simple guidelines.Get early prenatal careGood prenatal care is essential for you and your baby. Call your healthcare provider right away and schedule your first prenatal visit. During that visit you'll be screened for certain conditions that could lead to complications.If you haven't yet chosen a provider, get started now. Finding the right person  whether you're looking for a doctor or a midwife  can take a while. In the meantime, let your current caregiver know if you're taking medication or have any medical concerns.Watch what you eatNow that you're eating for two, you may be surprised to learn that you only need about 300 additional calories per day. Make sure you get plenty of protein. You now need 70 grams a day compared to 45 grams before you got pregnant. And while your calcium requirement remains the same, its more important than ever that you meet it, which is a challenge for many women.You'll want to steer clear of undercooked eggs and meat, unpasteurized dairy products and juices, raw seafood, and cold deli meats to avoid ingesting bacteria that could harm your baby. Also avoid certain fish that may contain high levels of mercury or other contaminants.Weight gain and pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:25Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:25Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosTake prenatal vitaminsMost prenatal supplements contain more folic acid and iron than you'll find in a standard multivitamin.It's important to get enough folic acid before conception and during early pregnancy. Folic acid greatly reduces your baby's risk of developing neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida.Ideally, you should start taking 400 micrograms of folic acid at least one month before becoming pregnant. Once your pregnancy is confirmed, up your daily dose to 600 mcg.You also need to make sure you're getting enough iron. Your iron requirement increases significantly during pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters.But more is not necessarily better  taking too much of certain things can actually be harmful. Avoid megadoses of any vitamin, and don't take any additional supplements or herbal preparations without your caregiver's okay.How to stay fit and healthy during pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:11Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:11Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videos Exercise regularlyA good exercise program can give you the strength and endurance you'll need to carry the weight you gain during pregnancy, help prevent or ease aches and pains, improve sluggish circulation in your legs, and help you handle the physical stress of labor. It will also make getting back into shape after your baby's born much easier.What's more, exercise is a great way to reduce stress, and some research suggests that staying active can boost your level of serotonin, a brain chemical linked to mood.Just remember not to push yourself too hard or let yourself get overheated or dehydrated. (You'll also need to avoid hot tubs and saunas while you're pregnant.)Get some restThe fatigue you feel in the first and third trimesters is your body's way of telling you to slow down. So listen up and take it easy as much as you can. If you can't swing a nap in the middle of the day, give yourself a break and let your other responsibilities slide a little. If you can't sleep, at least put your feet up and read a book or leaf through a magazine.Relaxation techniques such as yoga, stretching, deep breathing, and massage are all great ways to combat stress and get a better night's sleep.Just say no to alcoholDon't drink while you're pregnant: Any alcohol you drink reaches your baby rapidly through your bloodstream, crossing the placenta, and your baby can end up with higher levels of blood alcohol than you have.As little as one drink a day can increase your odds of having a low-birthweight baby and increase your child's risk for problems with learning, speech, attention span, language, and hyperactivity. And some research has shown that expectant moms who have as little as one drink a week are more likely than nondrinkers to have children who later exhibit aggressive and delinquent behavior.Women who have more than two drinks a day are at greater risk for giving birth to a baby with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Children born with this condition suffer from mental and growth retardation, behavioral problems, and facial and heart defects.Drinking also increases your risk for miscarriage and stillbirth. So play it safe  avoid alcohol completely and have a nonalcoholic drink instead. Let your caregiver know if you're having trouble giving up alcohol, so you can get help. Swear off all illicit drugsAny drug you use gets into your baby's bloodstream as well. Some studies suggest that marijuana may restrict your baby's growth and cause withdrawal symptoms (like tremors) in your newborn.Using cocaine is extremely dangerous. It restricts the flow of blood to the uterus and may lead to miscarriage, growth problems, placental abruption, or premature delivery. Your baby could be stillborn or have birth defects or developmental and behavioral problems.Other drugs can be very harmful, too. If you have a drug problem, seek help now.Stop smokingSmoking increases the risk of miscarriage, growth problems, placental abruption, and premature delivery. Some research has even linked smoking to an increased risk of having a baby with a cleft lip or palate.Not convinced yet? Smoking during pregnancy increases the chance that a baby will be stillborn or die in infancy. It's never too late to quit or cut back. Every cigarette you don't light gives your baby a better chance of being healthy. If you're unable to quit on your own, ask your caregiver for a referral to a smoking cessation program. Even if you're not a smoker, stay away from secondhand smoke.Cut back on caffeineThe March of Dimes advises women to limit their caffeine consumption intake to less than 200 mg per day, an amount you could get from one 8-ounce cup of strong coffee. This recommendation came from a 2008 study showing that women who consumed that much doubled their risk of miscarriage compared to those who had no caffeine.What's more, caffeine has no nutritive value and makes it harder for your body to absorb iron, something pregnant women are already low on. It's also a stimulant, so it can make it even harder for you to get a good night's sleep, give you headaches, and contribute to heartburn.Limit your coffee drinking or consider switching to decaf. And check the caffeine content of other products you consume, like tea, soft drinks, ""energy"" drinks, chocolate, and coffee ice cream, as well as over-the-counter drugs, such as headache, cold, and allergy remedies. Eliminate environmental dangersSome jobs can be hazardous to you and your developing baby. If you're routinely exposed to chemicals, heavy metals (like lead or mercury), certain biologic agents, or radiation, you'll need to make some changes as soon as possible.Keep in mind that some cleaning products, pesticides, solvents, and lead in drinking water from old pipes can also be harmful. Talk to your doctor or midwife about what your daily routine involves, so you can come up with ways to avoid or eliminate hazards in your home and workplace.See your dentistDon't forget about your oral health: Brush, floss, and get regular dental care. Hormonal shifts during pregnancy can make you more susceptible to gum disease. Increased progesterone and estrogen levels can cause the gums to react differently to the bacteria in plaque, resulting in swollen, bleeding, tender gums (gingivitis). So see your dentist for a checkup and cleaning now if you haven't had a visit in the last six months.Take care of your emotional healthMany women feel like they're on an emotional roller coaster at one time or another during pregnancy. But if your mood swings are extreme or interfering with your daily life, you may be suffering from depression, a relatively common condition.If you've been feeling low for more than two weeks and nothing seems to lift your spirits  or if you're feeling particularly anxious  share your feelings with your caregiver so you can get a referral for professional help.Also let your caregiver know if you're in an abusive relationship. Pregnancy can cause stress in any relationship, and it's a common trigger of domestic violence, which puts your health and your baby at risk."
Staying positive when you're pregnant again after a loss,https://www.babycenter.com/0_staying-positive-when-youre-pregnant-again-after-a-loss_9181.bc,"Why can't I be happy now that I'm pregnant again after miscarrying?Even though you've conceived again, it may be a while before you can enjoy this pregnancy. It's normal for a woman who has had a miscarriage to worry that she might lose this baby, too. That can make it difficult to feel excited about a subsequent pregnancy and trust that it will last.""A pregnancy after a loss can be the longest nine months of a woman's life,"" says Charlene Nelson, executive director of the Pregnancy and Infant Loss Center in Wayzata, Minnesota. ""There are so many things going on emotionally that anxiety is bound to be prevalent throughout the pregnancy.""Kim Kluger-Bell, a psychotherapist and author of Unspeakable Losses: Understanding the Experience of Pregnancy Loss, Miscarriage, and Abortion, agrees: ""It's going to be stressful  especially up to the time when the pregnancy was lost the last time.""Both Nelson and Kluger-Bell suggest not glossing over the anniversary of a pregnancy loss but rather recognizing and trying to accept it. You'll probably feel more sad and anxious as the date approaches, and that's normal.Don't beat yourself up for not feeling happy all the time. Allow yourself to feel your feelings: A good cry now and then relieves a lot of tension. And give yourself permission to share your feelings with trusted friends. Simply talking about fears can often alleviate them.""Once a woman passes the point of the previous loss, attachment to the pregnancy usually forms, and she starts to feel more positive,"" says Kluger-Bell. But don't assume your anxiety will disappear at that point. You may find that being so aware of the unpredictability of pregnancy means your fear and worry persist through labor and delivery. On the other hand, you may find your anxiety fading as you get closer to labor and meeting your baby.You may also still be grieving for the baby you lost, and that grief might dominate whatever joy you're experiencing. Unfortunately, our society doesn't always make room for feeling happiness and sadness at the same time, so people often feel they have to choose one or the other. But you don't have to choose  all your feelings are equally valid and real.How can I cope with my anxiety?There's no one answer. Chances are you'll feel anxious much of the time. But as you reach each milestone, such as hearing the heartbeat or feeling your baby move, you'll be reassured that things are progressing well. Here are some things you can do to stay positive:Focus on one day at a time. Easier said than done, but it really works. When you feel yourself worrying about the future, stop yourself and think only about today. ""Affirm each day,"" suggests Nelson. ""Celebrate the completion of each week.""Notice how this pregnancy is different from the pregnancy you lost, and especially consider how things are going better. Pay attention to what's going well each day and how you and your baby are staying healthy.Take good care of yourself. Do what you can to make this pregnancy a healthy one. Pay attention to your health and well-being. Sleep, good nutrition, breaks during the day, and regular physical activity will help you feel physically well and emotionally balanced. If possible, treat yourself to a prenatal massage now and then, and let the massage therapist know you're dealing with a stressful pregnancy. Prenatal yoga and meditation may also help.Find reasonable ways to manage stress and anxiety. You have enough to do just coping with the loss you've experienced. Don't overschedule yourself, pile on additional responsibilities at home or work, or overcommit yourself to family and friends. Focus on taking good care of yourself, which is within your control.Try relaxation exercises. Make up your own mantra, such as, ""Be healthy for the baby."" Nelson suggests talking to your baby to enhance the bonding process.Use relaxation techniques if your worries are keeping you from getting enough sleep at night. Talk to your healthcare provider if your worries keep you up at night for more than a week or two, or happen each night for a week. Empower yourself with knowledge about your loss. For example, if a past loss was diagnosed as a blighted ovum or cervical insufficiency, you might want to research those conditions. You may feel more in control of your situation if you understand what happened before. (Stop if too much information makes you feel overwhelmed.)Know you're not alone. If you don't know what caused your loss, recognize that many miscarriages and stillbirths don't have explanations. Remember that having had one miscarriage doesn't necessarily make you any more likely to have another one. Instead of worrying about something going wrong, try to focus on how well you and the baby are doing now. Chances are good that everything will be fine.Communicate with your partner. Your partner suffered a loss too, and you may want to turn to each other for comfort. But men and women often deal with loss differently, and although talking about what happened may make you feel better, it may make your partner feel worse. Respect each other's ways of coping with the loss, and don't take it personally if you deal with it differently.Check in with your doctor or midwife often. Seeing your healthcare provider regularly for prenatal care can reassure you that your baby is doing well. This is especially important if you're considered high risk. Although being labeled high risk sounds scary, it can actually be beneficial. ""You'll be monitored more closely, which can be a positive thing, especially if you're nervous,"" says Nelson.Ask to come in between scheduled visits to listen to the heartbeat if it will make you feel better. And if your provider isn't sensitive to your past loss, it might be time to find someone else.Find a support group. Kluger-Bell suggests contacting Share, an organization that supports people who've experienced pregnancy and infant loss, to help you find a group in your area. Sharing intimate details with strangers might feel uncomfortable at first, but group members often become trusted friends who can truly understand your feelings.If the particular group you're attending doesn't seem right for you, ask your provider for other options. You'll also find ongoing support in the BabyCenter Community in our Pregnancy After Loss group.Seek professional help if you need it. If you have symptoms of clinical depression or anxiety, get a referral to a therapist. The less emotional and physical stress to your system, the healthier you will be. And treating these problems during pregnancy will reduce your chances of postpartum depression or anxiety.A therapist who specializes in perinatal mood disorders will be best equipped to support you during pregnancy and postpartum. Ask your healthcare provider for a recommendation, or search online directories, such as Psychology Today and GoodTherapy. Postpartum Support International can help you find local resources and offers free live phone chats with experts as well as online support groups.Should we wait to tell friends and family we're pregnant again?This is a personal decision, and you should do what feels comfortable. Many people wait until they've passed the point of their previous miscarriage to share their news, but others find it helpful to tell family and close friends earlier so that they have a support system in place no matter what happens.Take some time to think about this, and talk it over with your partner. Make certain you both agree on what to do before you start letting people know.When sharing your news, keep in mind that your friends and family may expect you to be ""okay"" now that you're pregnant again. Do your best to avoid well-meaning people who say things like, ""See? The other one wasn't meant to be,"" or ""Now you can relax and be happy."" You may need to explain that being pregnant again doesn't mean you're done grieving your loss.No matter what, don't let others' expectations invalidate your experience.

Your first prenatal visit,https://www.babycenter.com/0_your-first-prenatal-visit_9344.bc,"When should I have my first prenatal visit?As soon as you get a positive home pregnancy test, call to schedule an appointment with your obstetrician, family physician, or midwife.If you haven't yet chosen a doctor or midwife to care for you during your pregnancy, it's still important to see a pregnancy caregiver now and get started on your prenatal care. You can always switch to another caregiver when you find the one you want to stick with.Many healthcare providers will schedule your first visit for when you're about 8 weeks pregnant. Some will see you sooner, particularly if you have a medical condition, have had problems with a pregnancy in the past, or are having symptoms such as vaginal bleeding, abdominal pain, or severe nausea and vomiting.If you're taking any medications or think you may have been exposed to a hazardous substance, ask to speak to your provider about it as soon as possible.Your first visit will probably be the longest unless you encounter problems along the way. At this and all future prenatal checkups, don't be afraid to raise any issues you've been wondering about. If questions come up between appointments, it may help to keep a running list.Inside pregnancy: Weeks 1 to 9 Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:57Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:57Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedEnglish Captionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosRead on to see what you can expect your healthcare provider to do on your first visit.Take your health historyHere's what your provider is likely to ask about:Gynecological health detailsWhether your menstrual cycles are regular and how long they tend to lastWhen the first day of your last period was (to determine your due date)Any symptoms or problems you've noticed since your last period (related to pregnancy or not)Any gynecological problems you have now or have had in the past (including sexually transmitted infections)Details about any previous pregnanciesOther aspects of your medical historyChronic conditions and medications used to treat themDrug allergiesPsychiatric problemsPast surgeries or hospitalizationsHabits that could affect your pregnancySmokingDrinkingDrug useWhether you are (or have been) a victim of abuse or have any other problems that could affect your safety or emotional well-beingYour family's medical historyWhether any of your relatives have had any chronic or serious diseases.(Many health problems are at least partly hereditary, so learning about your family's medical history helps your healthcare provider keep an eye out for potential problems.)Do a genetic and birth defect historyYour provider will ask:Whether you, the baby's father, or anyone in either family has a chromosomal or genetic disorder, had developmental delays, or was born with a structural birth defect.About any medications and nutritional supplements you've taken since your last period, and whether you've used alcohol or drugs. Take some time to think about any exposure you might have had to other potential toxins (bring a list of any concerns, especially if you live or work near toxic materials).Let your provider know if you've recently had any rashes, viruses, or other infections.Explain your options for prenatal genetic testingYour provider will offer you various screening tests that can give you some information about your baby's risk for Down syndrome as well as other chromosomal problems and birth defects.During your first trimester, you may be offered a blood test that's performed between 9 and 13 weeks. If it's available in your area, you'll also be offered a nuchal translucency screening (a type of ultrasound done at 11 to 13 weeks). Together, the blood test and the ultrasound are known as the first-trimester combined screening.Prenatal test: Nuchal translucency scan (NT scan) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:49Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:49Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Watch to learn more about this safe procedure. See all pregnancy videosFirst-trimester screening may be done in conjunction with the quadruple screen, a blood test done between 15 and 20 weeks.If you're at high risk for having a baby with a genetic condition, you'll likely be offered noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) in your first trimester. This is a blood test that can detect Down syndrome and some other chromosomal conditions at 10 weeks of pregnancy or later.If you haven't had it already, you may also want to have carrier screening. It's a simple blood or saliva test done to see whether your baby is at risk for any of 100 genetic disorders, such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, thalassemia, and Tay-Sachs disease.Finally, you'll be offered genetic diagnostic tests that can tell you for sure whether your baby has Down syndrome or certain other problems. These tests include chorionic villus sampling (CVS), generally performed at 10 to 12 weeks, and amniocentesis, usually done at 16 to 20 weeks.CVS and amniocentesis are invasive and carry a small risk of miscarriage, so women who choose to have these procedures are usually those with a higher risk for genetic and chromosomal problems. Some moms-to-be choose to wait for the results of screening tests before deciding whether to have one of these diagnostic tests.If you need more information, your provider can refer you to a genetic counselor.Check you out and run some testsSome healthcare providers will do an ultrasound at your first prenatal visit. But if you don't have any medical problems or concerns, it may not be part of the routine. Here's what's typical:A thorough physicalA pelvic exam, including a Pap smear (unless you've had one recently) to check for abnormal cells, which could indicate cervical cancerPossibly a culture to check for chlamydia and gonorrheaA urine sample to test for urinary tract infections and other conditionsYour provider will also order blood tests to:Identify your blood type and Rh statusCheck for anemiaTest for syphilis, hepatitis B, and immunity to rubella (German measles)Test for immunity to chicken pox unless you've definitely already had it or have received two doses of the vaccine against the virus that causes itYou may also request a screening to see if you have antibodies to cytomegalovirus (CMV). Read our article about how CMV can be dangerous to your unborn baby and what you can do to avoid contracting this mild virus during pregnancy if you haven't already been infected. This is especially important if you have a child in daycare since it would be easy for your child to pick up CMV there and pass it to you.The U.S. Public Health Service and a host of other organizations now recommend that all pregnant women be tested for HIV, the virus that causes AIDS, at their first prenatal visit. If your provider doesn't offer you an HIV test, be sure to ask about it. If you have the virus, being treated during pregnancy can dramatically reduce your chances of passing the infection to your baby.If you're at high risk for gestational diabetes, a glucose challenge test might be done at your first visit.In some cases, your provider will also do a skin test to see whether you've been exposed to tuberculosis.Counsel you and let you know what's aheadYour provider should give you advice about eating well, foods to avoid, weight gain, and prenatal vitamins. You'll hear about the common discomforts of early pregnancy and be warned about symptoms that require immediate attention.Your emotional health is very important. Your provider may screen you for signs of depression during pregnancy. But don't wait to be asked. If you're feeling depressed or anxious, let your provider know so you can be referred to someone who can help.Your provider will talk to you about the dangers of smoking, drinking alcohol, using drugs, and taking certain medications. If you need help quitting smoking or any other addiction, ask for a referral to a program or counselor.Your provider will also go over some do's and don'ts of exercise, travel, and sex during pregnancy; environmental and occupational hazards that can affect your baby; and how to avoid certain infections, such as toxoplasmosis.If it's flu season (or flu season is near), your provider will probably talk to you about getting a flu shot.Finally, you'll schedule your next appointment, which should be in about four weeks. See our articles on second-trimester prenatal visits and third-trimester prenatal visits for details on what's ahead.Show sources Hide sources Berghella V. 2007. Obstetric Evidence Based Guidelines.

Growth charts: Taking your toddler's measurements,https://www.babycenter.com/0_growth-charts-taking-your-toddlers-measurements_10870.bc,"What are growth charts?At each checkup, the doctor or nurse measures your child's length (or height), weight, and head circumference. Then your practitioner marks those numbers on a chart of averages for children of the same age and sex. In the end, you'll find out what percentile your child is in. (The most up-to-date charts take into account both breastfed and formula-fed babies.)For example, if the doctor tells you that your 12-month-old daughter is in the 75thpercentile for weight, it means that 75 percent of 12-month-old girls weigh the same or less than she does, and 25 percent weigh more. The higher the percentile number, the bigger your child is compared to other children of the same age.Growth charts show the full range of a child's growth at a specific age. For instance, a height chart for a 2-year-old girl shows the range from shortest to tallest. If your 2-year-old daughter is in the 50thpercentile, that means she falls right in the middle and is average height for her age.Parents sometimes worry needlessly about these percentages. Percentile ratings on a growth chart aren't like grades in school. A lower percentile rating doesn't mean there is anything wrong with your child.Let's say both parents are shorter than average and their child grows up to have the same stature. It would be perfectly normal for that child to consistently rank in the 10thpercentile for height and weight.Percentile measurements are a general guide to help you and your doctor assess your toddler's growth. What's important is that your child's growth is progressing. Your child's doctor checks to see that your child is growing at an appropriate rate.Remember that your child is an individual and will develop at her own pace. There's a wide range of healthy shapes and sizes among children. Genetics, activity level, health problems, and nutrition are just some of the factors that can influence growth.Child Growth Chart CalculatorSee how your child compares to other kids in height, weight, and head size.What are doctors looking for?Your child follows a particular growth curve and your doctor checks to make sure he stays on that curve. Your practitioner makes sure your toddler is gaining weight appropriately each time (no big dips, for example), and keeps an eye on his weight to make sure it isn't excessive for his height. (That might indicate potential weight problems down the road.)Instead of singling out one percentile number, your child's doctor looks at these measurements together to see an overall growth pattern. Sometimes natural growth spurts or slow-downs can make the numbers vary a bit, but usually your child should stay in roughly the same percentile for height and weight as he grows.A few different growth patterns can signal a problem. For instance, if your child is in the 40thpercentile for height and the 85thpercentile for weight, his weight could be an issue. It means that he's taller than 40 percent of the kids his age, but he weighs more than 85 percent of them. He may go through a growth spurt that puts him back at an appropriate height-to-weight ratio, or his doctor may want to look into why his weight is a little high.Likewise, if your child has consistently registered around the 60thpercentile for height at all of his checkups, and then his next checkup finds him in the 30thpercentile for height, your doctor will probably want to see if there's a reason he's not growing at the same pace he was before.Doctors typically use different growth charts, depending on how old your child is. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that doctors use theWorld Health Organization's growth chartsfor the first two years of your baby's life to get the latest and most accurate information.Once your child turns 2, your doctor will probably use theCDC's growth charts.How does the doctor take my toddler's measurements?Because an inch or a pound can make a pretty significant difference in where your toddler falls on the charts, your child is measured very carefully. The doctor or nurse takes three measurements:WeightYour practitioner may weigh your toddler by having her sit or lie down on a scale (either a traditional beam scale or an electronic model) or by having her stand on an upright scale, if she can stand on her own. Your child will probably have to take off her shoes and coat, but may or may not have to undress down to her undies. The measurement is usually taken in kilograms, and the doctor or nurse can then tell you how much your toddler weighs in pounds.Length/heightIf your child can't yet stand on her own, the doctor measures your toddler from the top of her head to the bottom of her heel while your child is lying down. Some doctors use a special device with a headboard and a movable footboard for accurate results. If your child is able to stand, the doctor measures her height when she's standing up.Head circumferenceTo measure your child's head, the doctor or nurse places a flexible measuring tape where your toddler's head has the largest circumference just above her eyebrows and ears, around the back of her head where it slopes up prominently from her neck.Why does it matter what size your toddler's head is? Your child's brain growth is reflected in the size of her skull.So if a child's brain isn't growing and developing steadily, her head circumference may not be increasing as it should. On the other hand, if the head circumference grows too quickly, it may be a sign of a problem like hydrocephalus (the buildup of fluid in the brain). Both conditions are unlikely, but important to rule out.By the way, children's heads are disproportionately large compared to adults' heads, so don't worry if your toddler's head looks big to you. Consider your own proportions, tooif you or your partner has a large or small head, your child might, too.Can I track my toddler's growth at home?Yes, you can, but it won't be as accurate as when the doctor or nurse does it. If you want to give it a try:Weigh your child. If your toddler doesn't stand up on his own, pick him up and get on the scale. Write down that number. Then put your toddler down and get on the scale alone. Subtract that number from your combined weight to get your child's approximate weight.Next, measure your toddler's height. Lay him down and stretch a measuring tape from the top of his head to the bottom of his heel. Again, your number won't be exactly the same as the doctor's, but you'll get a ballpark figure.To measure your toddler's head circumference, wrap a flexible measuring tape around his head just above his eyebrows and ears, and around the back where his head slopes up from his neck. The goal is to measure his head at the spot where it has the largest circumference.Once you have these measurements, plug them into ourgrowth percentile calculatorto find out roughly how your toddler compares to his peers. And if you're curious about how tall your toddler may be as an adult, you can figure that out with ourchild height predictor.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011a. Growth charts: By the numbers.

"Quick, nutritious snacks for time-starved moms",https://www.babycenter.com/0_quick-nutritious-snacks-for-time-starved-moms_11820.bc,"The following have been collected from seasoned moms, experienced in the postpartum search for something fast and wholesome to munch. Send someone to the grocery store for supplies if you're not up to the trip yourself.Quesadillas: The savory comfort of melted cheeseGrate or thinly slice about a quarter cup of your favorite cheese. Put it aside for a moment. Warm a dab of butter or a dash of oil in a wide frying pan on medium-low heat. Place a tortilla (corn or flour, whatever your preference) in the pan. Sprinkle with the cheese. Add a dash of hot sauce or sour cream if desired. Fold the tortilla in half, cover the pan, and cook for just a few minutes, until the cheese has melted. Let cool and enjoy. For variety, and a nutritious boost, add chopped onion, peppers, tomatoes, olives, or other favorite vegetables on top of the cheese and melt together.Gorp: Energy by the handfulBest known as an energy-boosting hiking snack, gorp, or trail mix, can also do wonders for tired moms. Make a big batch when you have a little time and keep it on hand for quick grabbing. In a large mixing bowl place two cups each of the following: raisins, peanuts, chopped dates or dried pineapple slices. Add one cup of each of these: coconut flakes, sunflower seeds. Mix together and voila, a great snack. Feel free to play with the ingredients, following your taste buds. Almonds, cashews, pumpkin seeds, currants, dried papaya, even chocolate chips are tasty options.Stuffed Celery Sticks: Light and crunchyClean and wash a bunch of celery, and cut sticks in half (approximately three-inch lengths). Fill with any of the following: softened cream cheese; sliced or grated hard cheese; cottage cheese; peanut butter; tuna fish (plain or mixed as a salad); egg salad. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Keep in the refrigerator.Baked Potatoes: A simple, filling dishThis old standby is easy to make. Wash a few large russet potatoes, always make extra for leftovers, cutting out any nubby ""eyes"" growing through the skin. Pierce a few times with a fork. Cover with a light coating of olive oil. Bake in a 400-degree-Fahrenheit conventional or toaster oven for about an hour, until soft all the way through to the center. Test with a fork or toothpick. If you can't wait an hour, use your microwave or cut potatoes into smaller pieces. Depending on your oven, it should take only five to ten minutes on the ""high"" setting. When done, slice a potato open and season with salt and pepper, butter, margarine, sour cream, yogurt, or a dash of olive oil, and dig in.For a heartier meal, stuff with anything you crave  shredded cheese, cottage cheese, chopped tomato, minced onion, sauted mushrooms, salsa, crumbled bacon, or leftover cooked vegetables.Keep the leftover potatoes in the refrigerator and use them later for a fried potato breakfast (just slice up the potato and heat it in a pan with oil, minced onion, and green or red pepper, seasoned with salt, pepper, and a dash of paprika.) Or, cut them into chunks and dress with a quick vinaigrette, your favorite salad dressing, or a little mayonnaise and seasonings for a quick potato salad; eat as is or toss with salad greens. Asparagus Roll-ups: meat and veggies in one quick mealBuy a half-pound of roast beef, sliced thinly at the deli counter, and a tub of whipped cream cheese. Break off and discard the root end of the asparagus, then steam or microwave until tender on the outside and crisp on the inside (this takes only a couple of minutes in the microwave and about five minutes on the stove). Spread a thin layer of cream cheese over a slice of roast beef and roll it around an asparagus stalk  a yummy meal in seconds.Fruit Cup: Cool, sweet, and nutritiousWhen you have a moment to do some prep work, wash and slice any fruit you desire, from apples, bananas, and grapes to melons, mangoes, kiwis, and strawberries. Aim for about one cup of each fruit. Toss together in a large bowl. Stir in a couple of tablespoons of lemon juice, which helps prevent browning and provides a zing of flavor. Eat plain or mix with your favorite flavor of yogurt for a filling meal. You can also add a little granola, wheat germ, or other cereal.Cheese and Crackers: A great source of calcium and proteinCocktail party grazing isn't a bad alternative when speed is of the essence. Stock up on your favorite crackers, from organic exotics to basic saltines. Buy several kinds of your favorite cheese, sliced from the deli counter if possible, to save time. When hunger hits, grab a handful of crackers, several slices of cheese, and arrange on a plate. Sliced cucumber, tomato, apple, avocado, pickles, or luncheon meats are great companions, if time allows.Scrambled Eggs: Not just for breakfast anymoreThe basics for scrambled eggs are pretty simple. Beat a couple of eggs in a small bowl with a fork. Season with salt and pepper. Pour in a skillet (nonstick is best) with a little butter, margarine, or oil and cook over medium heat, stirring gently and scraping along the bottom of the pan until cooked. Cooking time: a couple of minutes, at most. Great with toast, of course. Now, make it even better by adding chopped vegetables (green pepper, onion, and tomato are particularly good), or cheese, meats, salsa, crumbled tofu, even raisins and nuts. If you have leftover cooked veggies, warm them for a moment in the microwave or in a pan, and add them to your scramble. Prosciutto and Melon: A taste of sophistication in minutesBuy a half-pound of prosciutto sliced thinly at the deli counter and a ripe cantaloupe melon. Cut the melon into bite-sized pieces, then roll each in a slice of prosciutto. Use toothpicks to hold it together for easy snacking.Salsa: The condiment that does it allKeep a tub of good-quality salsa handy for flavorful meals in a hurry. Look for fresh salsa in the refrigerator section of the grocery; it's usually tastier than the salsas in jars. To mix up some quick guacamole, mash a ripe avocado with some salsa; add a spoonful of nonfat yogurt and some minced garlic, if you like. Enjoy it with baked low-fat corn chips, or scoop it up with celery sticks, raw zucchini wedges, or rice cakes.Fruit Smoothies: Vitamins and fiber in a portable packageKeep some fresh fruit on hand. Bananas, ripe peaches, mangoes, and sweet berries are great in any combination. If your favorite summer fruits are out of season, keep a few packages of frozen fruit in your freezer. Blend up right out of the freezer for a frosty drink.Smoothies can be made with a juice or a milk base. Pour 1 cup of juice, low-fat milk, or rice or soy milk into the blender. Add about a cup of fruit, any mix you like, and a bit of honey if needed, and blend until smooth. If it's too thick, add more liquid. Try orange juice with pineapple and strawberries or milk with banana and blackberries. You can add nonfat yogurt for a thicker drink, protein powder for added nutrition, or a dash of cinnamon or vanilla extract for flavor. If you have some ripe bananas that you can't eat before they spoil, peel them, cut into chunks, and keep in your freezer. Frozen banana makes a thick, creamy, drink that's as good as a milkshake. Try a milk-based smoothie with frozen banana and a tablespoon of peanut butter. For added decadence, blend in some instant cocoa powder."
Genetically modified foods: What you need to know,https://www.babycenter.com/0_genetically-modified-foods-what-you-need-to-know_12230.bc,"What does it mean when food has been ""genetically modified""?Genetically modified (GM), or genetically engineered (GE), foods are made from plants that have had traits in their DNA changed. Scientists take genes  the pieces of DNA that differentiate living things  from one plant or animal and insert them into another organism. These plants are also known as genetically modified organisms (GMOs).The purpose of genetically modifying plants is to make them better in some way. So a corn plant, for example, might have a gene added that makes it more nutritious, more tolerant of weather or growing conditions, or more resistant to herbicides, insects, or diseases.The first crops to be genetically modified in the United States were corn, soybeans, and cotton. Many processed foods, which contain large quantities of corn and soy, contain GMOs. In 2012, about 90 percent of all corn and soybeans planted in the United States were genetically engineered varieties.Other GM crops currently allowed in the U.S. food and feed supply are alfalfa, canola, chicory, corn, cotton, flax, papaya, plum, potato, rice, soybean, squash, sugar beet, and tomato.The same approach can be used to develop genetically engineered animals for medical and research purposes, as well as for food. Some are in development, including a type of salmon that grows to market size more quickly, but so far the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has not approved these for commercial use.Other genetically modified animals that have made headlines recently include a cow that may produce hypoallergenic milk and a more environmentally friendly pig, though funding for that project was halted in 2012.Could eating genetically modified foods be harmful to my child?The answer you get depends on whom you ask about this very controversial subject. The U.S. government assures the public that any genetically modified plants or animals it has approved are safe for consumers and the environment. But there isn't consensus in the scientific community, and many groups disagree.When it comes to food, many people believe that the more natural, the better  perhaps especially where their child is concerned. Because genetic combinations occur in the lab that aren't possible in nature, critics are concerned that playing with our food technologically may have far-reaching impacts on human health and the environment.Allergens are one concern. That's because GMOs may introduce known  or even unknown  allergens. If a person is allergic to something in the gene that has been introduced, she'll be allergic to the new product.There's even some concern that when you introduce a new gene into a plant, it's possible to create an entirely new allergen  causing allergic reactions in susceptible people (children in particular). And there's no good way to test these foods to make sure that won't happen.""Testing for allergens is difficult,"" says Jane Rissler, a plant pathologist and a senior staff scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists, a nonprofit public interest group.Also, while producers and the government work under the assumption that if the original foods were safe, the new product will also be safe, opponents believe that may not necessarily be true once the organism is significantly altered. Aren't GM foods tested for safety?There's no law requiring safety testing for most GM foods, says Rissler. The companies that produce them may test voluntarily, and many of them do, but Rissler and others argue that the companies aren't being held to a high enough standard, especially because the risks of genetic modification are largely unknown.Although experts agree additional research about GM foods is needed, theres a growing consensus in the medical community that more premarket testing and labeling are necessary, too. The American Medical Association says that mandatory testing should be required before GM foods are allowed on store shelves. And the American Academy of Environmental Medicine calls for a moratorium on GM foods in addition to immediate safety testing and labeling.On the environmental and economic fronts, opponents believe that GMOs will reduce the diversity of plants and result in a few big companies dominating the world's food production. Ecosystems may be altered as fish are engineered and beneficial insects possibly killed along with crop-destructive insects.GM foods also place a burden on organic farmers, whose crops are sometimes contaminated by GMOs from neighboring farms and who find it difficult to detect contaminants in the seed they buy.Proponents point out that GMOs have been on grocery shelves for many years (since 1996 in the United States), with no dire consequences. GMOs are less expensive to grow and require fewer pesticides, reducing the amount of toxins that end up in the soil, air, and water. By increasing yields, they say, GM products may even help feed people in developing nations.Supporters are also confident that there's nothing to worry about health-wise. ""Bioengineered foods do not pose any risks for consumers that are different from conventional foods,"" says FDA spokesperson Stephanie Kwisnek.Kwisnek points out that bioengineered foods are regulated by the FDA (which monitors the safety of all foods on the market), the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The USDA makes sure the plants are safe to grow, and the FDA ensures that any pesticides used are safe for humans and the environment.Kwisnek says that while safety testing and consultation for GMO foods is voluntary, companies still have a legal obligation under the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to make sure that any food they sell  conventional or GMO  meets all safety standards. If it doesn't, the FDA has the authority to take it off the market.The FDA doesn't require a product's label to disclose information about how the product was produced. If a bioengineered product resulted in significant differences from the original product, says Kwisnek, then labeling would be required. These differences might be in nutritional properties, for example, or the presence of an allergen.But without mandatory testing and labeling, critics say it's difficult to tell if a food has been genetically modified.How can I identify foods that are genetically modified?Actually, we eat genetically modified food every day without knowing it. That's because processed foods like vegetable oils and food additives  and even baby food  often use foods that have been genetically engineered, and there's no requirement that they be labeled as such.To the extent that identification is possible, though, consumer groups have called for labeling all genetically modified foods. ""That way, people who know they're sensitive will at least be able to avoid foods that may trigger a reaction,"" says Rissler. Without labels, those who are sensitive or reluctant to consume GM products have no options.According to the Center for Food Safety, 61 nations  including those in the European Union, Russia, and China  require at least some foods to be labeled as containing GMOs. In the United States, more than 20 states have similar legislation in the works.But the battle over labeling GMOs is far from over. In 2012, a ballot measure to label genetically engineered foods was narrowly defeated in California. Consumer groups attributed the loss to the millions of dollars the chemical and food industries spent campaigning against the measure.What can I do to avoid GMOs?If youre looking to keep GMOs out of your diet, the Center for Food Safety offers these tips:Buy organic. The USDA's National Organic Program regulates labeling of organic foods. Certified organic foods don't contain GMOs.Look for foods labeled ""non-GMO."" Some food producers voluntarily label their products.Avoid foods that are more likely to be genetically modified. The ""big four"" GMOs are found in processed corn, soybean, canola, and cottonseed. Corn and soy flour, canola and cottonseed oil, and beet sugar are genetically modified.Eat fresh fruits and vegetables. Most fresh fruits and vegetables in the United States aren't genetically modified. The few fruits and vegetables that may be genetically modified include zucchini, yellow crookneck squash, sweet corn, and Hawaiian papaya."
Vomiting (ages 3 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_vomiting-ages-3-to-8_66061.bc,"What should I do if my preschooler's vomiting?Throwing up is usually no cause for alarm. But in some cases it can signal a serious problem. Here's how to tell when your preschooler's vomiting needs immediate medical attention  and how to deal with vomiting that doesn't require a doctor's care.Call 911 immediately if:Your preschooler's having trouble breathing.He shows signs of severe dehydration, like sunken eyes, cold, splotchy hands and feet, excessive sleepiness, fussiness, or lightheadedness, dizziness, or delirium.Take your child to the emergency room if: He has severe abdominal pain. Have your child point to the part of his tummy that hurts. Pain that is centered around the navel and then moves to the lower right side of the abdomen, for example, could signal appendicitis.His vomit contains bile (a green substance) or blood that resembles dark coffee grounds. The doctor will probably want to see a sample of the vomit if it contains blood or bile, so as distasteful as it is, you should try to save some in a plastic baggie. Green bile can indicate that the intestines are blocked, a condition that needs immediate attention.He has a swollen, tender abdomen. This could indicate a buildup of fluid or gas, a blocked intestine, a hernia, or some other digestive tract problem. Blockages are uncommon but serious.He vomits more than once after suffering a head injury, which may indicate a concussion.He has a stiff neck, which is the hallmark sign of meningitis.Call your child's doctor if:Your child's been vomiting for more than 24 hours. For some illnesses, this is perfectly normal, but check with the doctor to be sure.Your child shows signs of becoming dehydrated, including decreased urination, dry lips and mouth, crying without tears, lethargy, and dark yellow urine.The vomit contains blood. A little blood in the vomit is usually nothing to worry about, as the force of vomiting can cause tiny tears in the blood vessels lining the esophagus. Your child's vomit may also be tinged with red if he's swallowed blood from a cut in his mouth or a nosebleed within the last six hours. But call the doctor if your preschooler continues to have blood in his vomit or the amount increases. As mentioned above, if the blood resembles dark coffee grounds, go to the emergency room right away.He has pain in the upper right side of the abdomen along with fatigue and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes). These might signal that your child has hepatitis.He regularly throws up when exposed to certain people or places. If your child vomits whenever he gets to preschool, for example, it could be a sign of stress. See what his doctor thinks (though you don't need to call her after-hours for this one!).Call a poison control center if:You suspect your preschooler has swallowed something toxic. Call the American Association of Poison Control Center's national emergency hotline at (800) 222-1222 or your local poison control center immediately. If you can identify what he's swallowed  for example, you find an empty medicine bottle  tell the medical experts what it is, and they'll give you exact instructions for taking care of your child.Experts used to tell parents to keep either syrup of ipecac or activated charcoal on hand for poisoning emergencies. But that's no longer the case: Ipecac is not an effective treatment for poisoning  most emergency rooms don't even use it anymore  and activated charcoal hasn't been proven a safe or effective remedy to give children at home.If you have ipecac in your home, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that you dispose of it immediately and safely. (Never throw away any medications in a garbage can that your child can get into.)How can I keep my preschooler from getting dehydrated?Dehydration can be a serious problem for young children, and if your preschooler is vomiting (or has a fever or diarrhea), he's losing precious fluids.Don't force your preschooler to drink anything when he's still vomiting frequently (every five or ten minutes). But after his tummy's been calm for half an hour or so, offer him slow, frequent sips of clear liquid, like water or broth  say 1 teaspoon (5 cc) every 10 minutes for a couple of hours. Then  if he tolerates that well  increase the amount to 2 teaspoons (10 cc) every 5 minutes. Continue to progress slowly until the vomiting eases up.Juices sometimes make matters worse (especially if your child also has diarrhea). But if juice is the only liquid your child will drink, don't increase the amount of juice he normally drinks in a day, but dilute it half and half with water. (So if he's drinking 3 or 4 ounces of juice in a day, you might dilute this to 6 or 8 ounces of liquid.) He might also enjoy ice pops or slushies made from electrolyte solutions or diluted juices. Don't give him carbonated drinks, though, as they're terrible for his teeth and won't help settle his stomach.When should I start feeding him solids again?Once your preschooler's vomiting diminishes or stops and his appetite returns, you can slowly reintroduce healthful foods. The AAP recommends that a child recovering from stomach troubles resume a normal diet as soon as possible: Offer him complex carbohydrates (like breads, cereals, and rice), lean meats, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables, but steer clear of fatty foods.This differs from the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) that doctors used to prescribe. Studies show that reintroducing a standard diet can actually shorten recovery time by half a day because it restores essential nutrients the body needs to fight infection. If your preschooler misses a few days' worth of good nutrition because his bug kills his appetite, don't worry. Just make sure you keep him hydrated.By the way, doctors vary on how they feel about milk consumption after vomiting; you might want to discuss this with your preschooler's doctor. What about medications?Don't give your child any prescription or over-the-counter anti-nausea medication unless his doctor recommends it.And never give medications containing aspirin to help relieve your child's symptoms. Aspirin can make a child susceptible to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal illness.Are there any safe home remedies?If your preschooler will drink it, you can brew up a tummy-friendly tea such as chamomile, peppermint, or ginger. To prevent scalding, serve it warm, not hot.Why is my child vomiting?Children vomit for a number of reasons, and while it's always disconcerting, it's usually not serious. (For guidance on when to see a doctor, see the first section of this article.) You'll want to find out what's causing it, though, both to confirm that he's okay and to make him more comfortable. If your child vomits once and that's the end of it, maybe he just ate too much at his last meal. If he continues to vomit, possible causes include:Viral or bacterial infectionA stomach flu or other intestinal illness is the most likely culprit. If a virus or bacteria have infected your preschooler's stomach lining or intestines, he may also have diarrhea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and fever. The vomiting usually stops within 12 to 24 hours.Other infectionsCongestion or a respiratory infection can also lead to vomiting, especially while your child's coughing. Strep throat, a urinary tract infection, and even an ear infection can sometimes cause nausea and vomiting. Throwing up can also be a symptom of serious illnesses like pneumonia, meningitis, appendicitis, and, in rare cases, Reye's syndrome.Motion sicknessSome children tend to get motion sickness, especially if they're sitting so low in the backseat that they can't see out the window. Experts believe that motion sickness happens when there's a disconnect between what your preschooler sees and what he senses with the motion-sensitive parts of his body, such as his inner ears and some nerves.Poisonous substanceYour preschooler could be vomiting if he's swallowed a toxic substance like a drug, plant, medicine, or chemical. Or he may have gotten food poisoning from contaminated food or water. He may have diarrhea instead of or in addition to vomiting. Can I do anything to prevent vomiting?Yes, several strategies are worth trying:If your child has a lot of phlegm and mucus from a respiratory infection, you can encourage him to blow his nose. Be patient, as it might take him a while to master the technique!To help minimize motion sickness, schedule plenty of stops during your trips to give your preschooler a chance to get some fresh air and calm his tummy. Give him a small snack before the trip  having something in his stomach will help. And offer plenty of fluids to keep him hydrated; otherwise he may get headachy or even dizzy or weak, which will only make him more miserable.You can give your child certain medications for motion sickness, but you'll want to know how they affect him before starting out on a trip. They may cause drowsiness or dry mouth and nose (keep those fluids handy), but sometimes they have the opposite effect and cause irritability and hyperactivity. If you want to give one a try, ask your preschooler's doctor for advice. Motion sickness patches are not for use on children under age 12, so don't cut one in half to deliver a smaller dose to your preschooler.Show sources Hide sources AAP. Undated. Treatment of vomiting.

Cholesterol screening in children,https://www.babycenter.com/0_cholesterol-screening-in-children_3657434.bc,"The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) has a new policy on testing cholesterol levels in young children. Most surprising and interesting to parents is the recommendation that some kids ages 2 to 10 have their cholesterol tested, and that some kids as young as 1 drink low-fat (2 percent) milk instead of whole milk.If you think these recommendations might apply to your child, read the policy statement below and ask your child's doctor.Here's the AAP's announcement about its new recommendations. The policy was published in the July 2008 issue of Pediatrics, the AAP's peer-reviewed journal:New AAP Policy on Lipid Screening and Heart Health in ChildrenThe American Academy of Pediatrics has issued new cholesterol screening and treatment recommendations for children. The policy statement, ""Lipid Screening and Cardiovascular Health in Childhood,"" recommends cholesterol screening of children and adolescents with a family history of high cholesterol or heart disease. It also recommends screening patients whose family history is unknown or those who have other factors for heart disease including obesity, high blood pressure or diabetes. Screening should take place after age 2, but no later than age 10. The best method for testing is a fasting lipid profile. If a child has values within the normal range, testing should be repeated in three to five years. For children who are more than 8 years old and who have high LDL concentrations, cholesterol-reducing medications should be considered. Younger patients with elevated cholesterol readings should focus on weight reduction and increased activity while receiving nutritional counseling. The statement also recommends the use of reduced-fat dairy products, such as two percent milk, for children as young as 1 year of age for whom overweight or obesity is a concern."
Preemie miracles: Parents share their premature baby's story,https://www.babycenter.com/0_preemie-miracles-parents-share-their-premature-babys-story_10300029.bc,"Every year, about half a million babies are born prematurely in the United States, and the numbers are increasing at an alarming rate. Through a nationalPrematurity Campaign, theMarch of Dimesis working hard to find answers so that all babies can have a full nine months to develop.If you've had a premature baby in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) and would like to share your experience with others, visit theMarch of Dimes Share Your Story website,an online community for families. You can also join the conversation in BabyCenter's Community'sPreemie Parentinggroup.You may also want to check out BabyCenter's photo gallery ofpreemie success stories.Catharine Aboulhouda: Tiny babies can make a differenceExpected to be her family's Halloween treat, Catharine Aboulhouda instead arrived on the Fourth of July. She weighed just 1 pound, 10 ounces, and measured only 12 inches long. Because she was 16 weeks early, her eyes were still fused shut. Catherine fought for every breath, facing daily challenges caused by a heart defect, bleeding in her brain, jaundice, and a heart murmur.Her mom Susan recalls: ""Most parents dream of the moment their child is born and holding them only seconds after. But for my husband Mike and me, it would be a very long time before we could ever cuddle or gently caress our precious little girl. From the simple questions about her diapers to overwhelming medical procedures, we were in for a roller coaster ride that we never expected to take.""After 113 days in the NICU, Catharine went home with her parents and big brother Michael. She was still fragile enough to need monitors and oxygen. Amazingly, she has no lasting consequences of her extremely premature birth.Today, Catharine, from Allentown, Pennsylvania, is a healthy 5-year-old with the energy of a firecracker. She loves singing, reading with her grandparents, and swimming with Michael.""Perhaps one reason Catharine came into the world early,"" says Susan, ""is to let people know that even the tiniest babies can make a difference.""Tyler Jameson: Facing challenges as an ""extreme preemie""Tyler's mom Shellee Jameson says: ""I developedpreeclampsiawith my first baby and was hospitalized on complete bedrest. The cause of preeclampsia is unknown, and the only cure is delivery.""Because I was only 26 weeks into my pregnancy, we were hoping to delay delivery at least another month. However, our efforts failed. Due toplacental abruption, Tyler was delivered by emergencyc-sectionat 26 weeks. He stayed in the NICU for 98 days.""Tyler experienced many of the commoncomplications associated with extreme prematurityincluding respiratory distress syndrome, apnea, anemia, bronchopulmonary dysplasia, intraventricular hemorrhage, patent ductus arteriosis,jaundice, and infections. The most life threatening were the infections of sepsis (blood infection), pneumonia, and bacterial meningitis as well as having a pulmonary hemorrhage.""As a result of his illnesses, he developed hydrocephalus requiring two shunt surgeries before the age of 6 months. Every day, it seemed the doctors were telling us something else was wrong.""But thanks to God, the wonderful doctors and nurses, and medical advances, our son is doing wonderfully. Tyler is now 2 years old and showing no signs of cerebral palsy, vision or hearing problems, or other disabilities common in premature babies. I have been told by our pediatrician, NICU doctors, nurses, and therapists that Tyler is truly a miracle."" Zeek Taylor: Fighting for life, now thrivingEzekiel ""Zeek"" Taylor was born severely premature, 14 weeks before his due date. He weighed just 1 pound, 14 ounces.His father Corey Taylor spent many frightening days watching both his wife and their tiny baby fight for their lives. Betty had developed complications 26 weeks into her pregnancy and was rushed to the emergency room. Doctors told Corey that his wife was in danger of heart failure and coma, and they needed to perform an emergency cesarean section.Although both mom and baby made it through the delivery, Zeek spent the first 103 days of his life in the neonatal intensive care unit, fighting to survive. He was given surfactant therapy to help his immature lungs inflate between each breath and went on to fight and win one medical battle after another  anemia, abnormal blood flow from the heart, and jaundice.Even after he went home, Zeek faced surgery to correct reflux problems, retinopathy of prematurity, hernias, and pressure on his brain due to meningitis.Seven and a half years later, Zeek is an artistic kid who loves music, cooking, making greeting cards, and performing with a drum line. When Zeek served as theNational Ambassador for the March of Dimes, he traveled the country with his parents to share their story, raising awareness of the seriousness of premature birth.Betty explains, ""Due to the increasing rate of premature birth among African American women, we feel an urgency to work with the March of Dimes to raise awareness and to support research that would further impact the lives of babies. We're very passionate about helping all families.""Alexa Marie Ostolaza: From small beginningsBorn 15 weeks premature and weighing only 1 pound, 4 ounces, Alexa Marie Ostolaza is living proof that there is hope, thanks to breakthroughs in medicine, advances in research, and the generosity of strangers.When her mom developed dangerously high blood pressure, Alexa was delivered by emergencyc-section. She suffered breathing problems and bleeding in her brain. During the 108 days she spent in neonatal intensive care, Alexa battled the odds and, miraculously, beat them.Today Alexa lives with health challenges resulting from her premature birth, including mild cerebral palsy. She also has a permanent shunt in her brain. She attends physical therapy regularly. Despite this, Alexa is a radiant, energetic 5-year-old who is the pride and joy of her parents Josue and Jessica Ostolaza of Gainesville, Florida.Eliza Allyn: Signaling she had to be born earlyEliza's mom Dana says: ""If September 20 had been a weekday, my story would have turned out differently. If I'd been at work, busy, I wouldn't have noticed that she hadstopped kicking.""I was 30 weeks pregnant and was told I was having a textbook (normal)pregnancy. So that day, Saturday, September 20th, I was sitting on the couch at home being lazy. By midafternoon I noticed that I wasn't feeling the usual kicks and tumbles in my belly, and I called my OB. The doctor on call told me to come up to the hospital just to check it out  'better to be safe than sorry.'""We went to the hospital at about 6 p.m., and they took the baby's readings. The next thing I knew, there were about 15 people in the tiny triage room. They told me that they would have to do an emergencyc-section. I, of course, got hysterical. I was only 30 weeks pregnant! I'd been reading about fetal development, and I knew that the baby wasn't done growing.""The c-section happened so fast. Eliza Allyn was delivered by 7:01 p.m. and weighed 2 pounds, 10 ounces. They showed her to me for one second  all wrapped up in a blanket. Her face was pink, and she looked small but healthy to me. The doctors told me that if I had waited until my regular appointment two days later, she wouldn't have made it. As tiny as she was, Eliza gave me a signal that she needed to be born and stopped kicking.""Eliza was rushed to the NICU, and I was sent to recovery. My husband went down to the NICU alone during the night to see her because I couldn't move yet. He returned to my room and said that the doctors could barely look him in the eye. Eliza had had a lung bleed and a brain bleed sometime during that night. But 30-weekers usually have good outcomes, so we were hopeful. They said the next 24 to 48 hours were very critical.""I guess she was really tough. After that first day, she stabilized and then made nothing but progress. Eliza's doctor called her 'the perfect preemie.' My placenta was sent to a pathologist, who discovered that I had a severe maternal floor infarction, meaning that the placenta had essentially clotted and died, so that Eliza was getting no nutrition from it.""For the next month, Eliza lived in the NICU, and we visited her every day. Each day the nurses told us how much she ate and how many grams she gained. After four days, I got to hold her and cuddle. I didn't want to let go. It seemed like forever until she came home with us. On October 21, Eliza finally came home, weighing 4 pounds, 4 ounces.""Last month Eliza turned 1! She's over 20 pounds now, cruises the furniture, says words like 'bubbles' and 'ladybug' and is perfectly healthy. It's because of the March of Dimes and their research on prematurity that Eliza thrived in the NICU, and that next time I'm pregnant, we can take steps to prevent another premature birth."""
Baby food revolution: Rules for feeding your baby that still apply,https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-food-revolution-rules-for-feeding-your-baby-that-still_10323111.bc,"When it comes to feeding your baby, change is in the air. Check outBaby food revolution: New rules for feeding your babyto learn how to get your baby started on a lifetime of good eating.Not everything has changed, of course. Here are some tried and true guidelines that still apply.(Note: Before starting your baby on solid foods, make sure he's at least 4 months old and shows signs of readiness.)Introduce new foods one at a timeEven though the restrictions onwhatto feed babieshave loosened, the thinking onhowto feed them still stands:Offer new foods one at a time, and wait about three to five days before introducing the next new food. This way, if your baby has a bad reaction, you'll know what caused it.Signs of an allergic reactioninclude diarrhea, vomiting, rash, or hives. If you notice these symptoms within minutes or hours of your baby eating a new food, call your baby's doctor right away.

See all videosKeep in mind that the rule for introducing foods one at a time isn't a foolproof method for catching allergies. It's possible for babies to have an allergic reaction to a food they've eaten before with no problem. This may be especially likely if their first few exposures to the food were small amounts of it in a different food  for example, a muffin made with eggs or milk.Feed your baby the necessary fatsGrocery store shelves are bursting with low-fat and nonfat products  should babies be eating these? Absolutely not.""Fat is essential for growth. Both breast milk and formula contain a lot of it,"" says Seattle pediatrician Susanna Block.Experts recommend serving babies full-fat dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt, until age 2.Note: Don't give your baby cow's milk to drink until after her first birthday. At that point, serve whole milk (unless the doctor tells you otherwise).The unsaturated fat in avocado makes it another wonderful choice for your baby, and the same goes for salmon and other fatty fish because they contain essential fatty acids, including omega-3s.Offer rejected foods again  and againWhen it comes tosampling new foods, babies make harsh critics. Offer a mouthful of your famous pureed green beans with dill, and your baby may swallow it reluctantly  or spit it out and push your hand away, mouth clamped shut.Don't force the issue. For one thing, your baby may just not be hungry. Babies' appetites fluctuate, and they need less food than many of us think.On the other hand, your baby might be turned off by the look, smell, or taste of a food.

See all videos""Research shows that children will often begin to tolerate a new food only after they're exposed to it several times,"" says pediatrician Block.So although it can be frustrating to watch your baby reject the food you've lovingly prepared, take a deep breath and try again another day.Limit junk foodEveryone knows that junk food is unhealthy, but the negative effects can be much more serious for babies. (Unfortunately, some classic kid foods actually qualify as junk. See our list of theworst foods for babies.)That's because even a very small serving of sugary or salty junk food is likely to make your baby feel full, leaving less room for healthier food with the nutrients necessary for brain growth and development.""Babies' calorie needs are relatively low, but their nutrient needs are high,"" says physician and dietitian Christine Gerbstadt. ""Insufficient nutrition can even affect [when your baby reaches]milestones.""Does this mean you're a bad parent if you let your little one sample a french fry or gnaw on a corner of your chocolate chip cookie once in a while? No  just don't make it a regular habit because it could encourage your baby to develop a taste for sugary or salty foods.Be aware of choking hazardsChoking is still a danger, so this more relaxed attitude aboutfeedingbabies definitely doesn't extend to food size and consistency.Mash or puree your baby's food, and keep in mind that eating is like any other milestone  babies reach it at different times. Some babies will be ready for thicker, lumpier purees before others.""If you notice your baby coughing on the thicker puree, it may mean he's not ready to handle it yet. Take it away and step back down to the thinner puree for a while,"" says Block. If the problem persists, talk to your child's doctor.As your baby progresses tofinger foods, you'll no longer need to puree everything, but just be sure to cut food into small pieces no larger than 1/2 inch. And don't give your baby choking hazards, such as hot dogs, nuts, chunks of raw vegetables, and popcorn. See morefoods that can be unsafefor your baby or toddler.Demonstrate the joy of eating""Dining with one's friends and beloved family is certainly one of life's primal and most innocent delights,"" Julia Child famously said.Enjoying your food is the most meaningful thing you can do to foster a similar appreciation in your little one. Babies watch their parents and model them, so experiment with different flavors and new foods. Let your baby see you eating and savoring lots of different healthy foods. If you enjoy the simple pleasure of eating good food, chances are your baby will too.Unfortunately, it's also easy to become frustrated and stressed about your baby's eating habits. Her fickle appetite, your concern about whether she's eating enough, and the sheer messiness can conspire to turn feeding time into a chore  or even an outright battle.It doesn't have to be this way. There are several things you can do to make mealtime an enjoyable experience. First, make sure you have enough time so that you aren't hurrying your baby's meals. And hard as it is, accept the mess as a given  letting babies play with their food is actually good for them.""Young children who are learning to eat should be allowed to make messes. While playing they're actually learning about new tastes and smells and how to get food into their mouth,"" says dietitian Eileen Behan. ""Most important, they're learning that eating can be pleasant and enjoyable.""To make cleaning up easier, put a splat mat under your baby's highchair. On warm days, consider letting your baby dine topless to lighten your laundry load. And take comfort in knowing that everything is washable, including your baby.Show sources Hide sources AAAI. 2013.

"Birth story: Eight weeks early, and far from home",https://www.babycenter.com/0_birth-story-eight-weeks-early-and-far-from-home_10339775.bc,"Eion Gabriel(A boy)Born October 15, 2007, at 6:41 p.m.4 pounds, 10 1/2 ounces and 17 3/4 inchesThe proud parents: Brandon and JessiBrandon is from Florida and I am from Seattle. We met through our involvement in a traveling Christian drama company that gathers twice a year in Los Angeles for training. We began dating in the summer of 2000. We were engaged a year later and married a year after that. We live on Eielson Air Force Base in Alaska.How it all beganBrandon and I knew we wanted children early in our relationship. We started talking about children's names a few weeks after we started dating. We thought we'd gotten our wish in June 2002, just a little earlier than planned - our wedding was set for July. But a joyous time turned tragic when I miscarried at 7 weeks.Brandon joined the Air Force in February 2003 and was gone for training for more than six months. When he returned, we decided to try to conceive. Every month I hoped the pregnancy test would be positive, and every month it wasn't. Through a move from California to Idaho, and another to Alaska ? with Brandon gone for a year overseas in between - we kept trying and kept being disappointed.When we got to Alaska, we decided to look into reasons for our infertility. Brandon went through testing, and I began mine. We had preliminary tests (pelvic exam, blood tests, etc.) and I had a referral to the OB office in Fairbanks. On a whim, I took one last pregnancy test. And I nearly fainted when it turned positive.Brandon's first reaction, of course, was to buy another test. Lo and behold, it was still positive. A quick run to the lab at the doctor's office confirmed the home tests. Given my previous miscarriage, terror immediately set in and didn't really ease until the third trimester.At my 20-week ultrasound, we found out we were having a boy. I was shocked ? I'd been having ""girl"" feelings since the start of the pregnancy.I had a little morning sickness, but not too bad - mostly it was a challenge trying to eat breakfast. I was closely watched for gestational diabetes because of my family history. I failed my first test, but passed the three-hour test.All in all, I had a normal pregnancy. Until Eion decided he wanted to be an October baby instead of a December baby. ShowtimeThe evening of October 4, Brandon made Hamburger Helper for dinner and we sat down to watch The Wedding Singer on television. I had been feeling increased pressure and Braxton Hicks contractions, but thought I was just overdoing it a bit.Near the end of the movie my water broke. I felt some wetness but thought it was urine leakage, so I went to the bathroom. I came back to watch the rest of the movie and it happened again, but with more fluid. I realized something was wrong and tried to figure out how to tell Brandon without freaking him out. Somehow I managed it, and we drove to the Army hospital 26 miles away. I wasn't sure how much time we might have before active labor began, so we didn't pack anything. I figured Brandon would be able to go back to get things like clothes, DVDs, books, etc. I wore my pajamas and slippers and took my pillow and a stuffed bear.We arrived at the emergency room and were sent to labor and delivery to be examined. Eion's heart rate looked good and I wasn't having any real contractions, but the membrane rupture meant we were there for the duration. Or so I thought. It turned out that the Army hospital doesn't take deliveries earlier than 36 weeks, and the local hospital doesn't take deliveries earlier than 34 weeks. At 30 weeks and six days, I had to be flown to the hospital in Anchorage. I don't fly well, and the idea of flying scared me more than the baby coming too early. Two hours and a few sick trays later (yuck) we arrived at the hospital.I was admitted to labor and delivery and watched for 24 hours. Still no contractions, so I was moved to the prenatal unit. We waited and waited and waited through three-times-a-day monitoring and occasional checking of Eion's lung maturity levels from the amniotic fluid I was still slowly leaking. Two ultrasounds showed that I was replacing the lost fluid and baby Eion still had plenty to keep him cushioned. The rupture, however, put him at risk of exposure to infection, despite all my IV antibiotics. Ten days later, Eion's lungs were judged to be mature enough that we could induce labor.I was scheduled to be induced at 7:30 a.m. Oct. 15. That morning I woke up around 6 a.m. and went to the rest room. For the first time since we arrived, I could answer the ""is the fluid pink"" question with a yes. Apparently my body knew it was time. I wonder now if I would have gone in to labor on my own that day if they hadn't induced me. A few days earlier, I had had some fairly regular contractions, which we were able to ease with positioning.My oxytocin was started around 9 a.m. and the contractions began. They were very short with little time between them. I was able to breathe through them pretty well until about noon. Uncomfortable on my back, I switched to my left side. I'd been having a tightening sensation before the painful part of each contraction, but no more. Suddenly I had no warning for each contraction, and they were growing stronger. Brandon was allowed to watch my epidural and still says it's the coolest thing he's ever seen. I immediately started feeling better, but gradually realized the epidural wasn't as effective on my left side. It was bearable, but I could feel the contractions more on that side.When the doctor checked me at around 6:15 p.m., I was 100 percent effaced, fully dilated. The moment I'd been dreading was here. I was terrified of having to push. What if he got stuck? What if it took forever? I didn't need to worry about it. Thirty minutes later, our beautiful son had arrived, born eight weeks early. He was quickly passed to the NICU team and I had time to think a thousand thoughts. After deliveryI had been increasing my epidural to compensate for the left side being off, so it took a while for the right leg to work well enough that I could get up and into a wheelchair to visit Eion. Brandon left for the NICU as soon as he could, so he was already there when I finally got to hold my beautiful baby boy.After a miscarriage and five years of trying, plus a shaky ending to my pregnancy, I was overwhelmed. It took a long while to accept that he was mine - not someone else's that I got to hold, but mine. I still sometimes look at him in disbelief and wonder.Eion spent 26 days in the NICU. He had IVs for possible infection and nutritional supplementation, a nasal cannula for a tiny bit of oxygen support, phototherapy lights to lower his bilirubin levels, a feeding tube as he learned to eat and his body learned to digest food, temperature control in a warming bed, a normal head ultrasound, and a normal chest X-ray. When he was moved to the annex, he watched his first Miami Dolphins football game with his daddy.Looking back, and moving onThere are so many things I wish had been different. I wish he'd been born full term. I wish we could have delivered nearer home. I wish we'd known earlier that the military would pay for us to stay closer the hospital, which would have made it easier to spend more time with Eion in the NICU. I wish I'd known we would be transferred to Anchorage - I would have risked a bit of time to pack a suitcase. We hadn't packed anything, so we had to buy clothes for Brandon, me, and Eion, including something to help pass the time during ten days of bedrest. It was a difficult experience, but the nurses were great. They took very good care of us.As I write this, Eion is a healthy 7-week-old. He's still on a monitor for apnea, but true episodes are few and far between. In many developmental areas he's caught up and ahead of the game!"
Moms say: Top 12 things to pack for the hospital,https://www.babycenter.com/0_moms-say-top-12-things-to-pack-for-the-hospital_10339938.bc,"It can be difficult to know what to pack for your baby's birth, especially if you're becoming a mom for the first time. Our packing list for the hospital or birth center will tell you exactly what to include, but for more real-world tips we asked more than a thousand moms for advice. Here's what they told us:Cozy clothes and nightwearMany moms preferred to ditch the hospital gown in favor of their own clothes.I loved that I packed a jersey cotton robe. Easy for nursing and comfy.I was glad to have my yoga pants and a T-shirt. Being in your own clothes at the hospital (for the recovery part) makes you feel so much better than being in the hospital gown.I was glad I brought a comfy nightgown! I lived in that thing and it was so much better than the hospital ones.Black cotton shorts worked out great because I didn't want anything that would show blood if I had a leak.I bought pajamas for the hospital, and I still wear them now. They have a front opening, which made breastfeeding easier.I lived in my yoga pants, nursing tank top, and hoodie the whole time I was in the hospital. So much better than those gowns!Loose-fitting, comfortable shirts were the best things I packed.Roomy footwearYour feet may be somewhat swollen after delivery, so pack comfy shoes just in case.Slippers were the only thing I could get on my feet because they were so swollen.My flip-flops were the best thing I packed. They were comfortable and easy to get on and off.Giant fluffy socks were the only thing that would fit over my swollen legs.Slippers were really helpful for walking in the halls!I loved the fact that I had my own slippers. I wore those the entire time, even through the delivery!Flip-flops were very helpful. Though I gave birth in January, they were comfortable to wear in the hospital, as my feet swelled.Memory makersMemories of your stay in the hospital or birthing center may always be a bit of a blur, but you can document the experience for posterity with a few simple tools.My camera, with extra batteries, was a lifesaver!I packed our baby book, which was great. They happily put her hand- and footprints in it for us.It was very helpful for me to have my cell to take pictures.ToiletriesWhen it comes to personal comfort, little things can make a huge difference. Two of the most popular personal care items among our survey participants were lip balm and hair ties. Here are some more ideas:I packed a brush, toothpaste, and mouthwash.I was glad I had my lotion.I was glad I brought my own shampoo and body wash. It made me feel more comfortable to stay with my own routine.Leave-in hair conditioner was one of the best things I brought with me.I was glad to have my own mini shampoos, conditioner, face wash, and lotions. Also my own toilet paper  it was way better than the hospital's.Bringing my makeup was an excellent decision. There's no feeling like waking up the next day as a mother, showering, and putting makeup on to get ready for adoring guests.Stuff to doBelieve it or not, you may have some downtime in the hospital or birthing center, either while waiting for labor to really get going or while recuperating after the birth. Consider packing a couple favorite pastimes.Magazines helped to pass the time.I'm glad I had lots of puzzle books since I was in the hospital for two and a half days.My MP3 player and player dock with speakers were very helpful.I brought movies to watch and relax with the baby.Through our laptop, we were able to update family and friends  and it was a source of entertainment while we were there.It was really nice to have my e-reader so I could read when I was stuck in bed.Sleep helpersEveryone tells you to sleep when the baby sleeps, but it isn't always easy to reach the land of nod from the hospital.Having my own pillow was great.I loved having my own pillow. It was nice to sleep on and it was easier to hold the baby with after my c-section.Earplugs and a mask kept out light and noise.My husband wished he would have brought his own pillow and an extra blanket. Hey, comfortable daddy = better equipped to help momma.SnacksHospitals have gourmet snacks available around the clock, right? Uh, wrong. Pickings might be slim  especially if you find yourself famished in the wee hours.I was glad we brought lots of snacks. There were a lot of times when we were hungry and didn't want to go out to get something.I brought snacks for after delivery. I was starving and ate a nutrition bar about 10 minutes after delivering. I also brought powdered mix to flavor the water since I drank a ton of it during labor.I packed snacks for middle-of-the-night munchies.We packed lots of food so my husband wouldn't need to leave to get something to eat  that was great!I was so glad to have fresh fruit, juice, and cheese in a cooler.I should've packed more snacks! I got hungry a lot when I was up at night trying to nurse.Nursing aidsIf you plan to breastfeed, packing a few things can help you get off to a smooth start.My lanolin cream for breastfeeding was the best thing I brought.I made sure to take my nursing pillow. I don't know what I would have done without it!A nursing bra was helpful.Breast pads were very helpful. I was leaking a ton.Baby clothesSome moms told us their newborns were just fine in the undershirts provided by the hospital, but many others felt differently.We brought outfits in three sizes, and she fit the teeniest, which I never would have guessed beforehand. I never thought I would have such a small baby!Bring more than one baby going-home outfit. We had to stay an extra three days and these extra outfits came in handy.I packed a set of newborn clothes and a set of 0-3 month clothes.I was glad to have baby clothes in different sizes for the going-home outfit  it turned out we needed the preemie size!I should have brought an outfit to take pictures in besides the going-home outfit. Our hospital took photos and I wished my son had something to wear other than the hospital shirt.Pads and extra underwearHospital-issue pads and underwear may be functional, but they're not exactly top of the line. As many BabyCenter moms realized, packing your own can save you discomfort.I was happy I brought my own pads! The hospital's were huge and bulky.I was glad I had my own sanitary pads during recovery. I was much more comfortable.Disposable underwear are heavensent! They're way better than those maternity pads.Disposable underwear turned out to be invaluable  I hated the flimsy mesh underwear they gave me at the hospital.I wish I had bought some cheap underwear (granny panties) that fit me for after delivery. I didn't like the ones provided.I read, with my first child, to wear Depends. I laughed, but at the last minute decided to try it. It saved my life, and I was at ease!!These were not the sexiest things to use, but disposable adult diapers were very comfortable. I didn't stain any of my clothes, and the nurses thought it was the best idea ever!Baby suppliesSurprisingly, your hospital or birthing center may not provide all the baby supplies you need for those first few newborn days  even pacifiers can be hard to come by.I wish I'd brought my baby's nail file. She scratched her face pretty badly on the first day.A pacifier. My hospital didn't provide one, and I sure needed it!I wish I had packed pacifiers because my baby wasn't satisfied with the one they provided at the hospital. When we got home, we tried a couple of different brands until we found out what he enjoyed.TowelsBringing your own towel means you have to lug it home again, but many moms felt it was worth it.I wish I had taken a nice washcloth and towel. The hospital's were terrible!I wish I'd had my own bath towel for showers. The towels at the hospital were so rough and awful!I would definitely recommend going out and buying the largest, thickest towel you can find, or bringing your favorite one from home.And a few more suggestionsA friend of ours recommended bringing a string of white Christmas lights, and that turned out to be our favorite thing. The hospital lights are so harsh. In the recovery room, we turned theirs off and used the ambient light from the Christmas lights the whole time. It was peaceful, warm, and made for a more inviting atmosphere. Try it!Bring an extra empty bag! I acquired so much to take home! Extra formula, swaddle blankets, just stuff. Oh, and bring a folder. You will have a lot of paperwork to take home with you!A small gift for the nurses  they do so much for you during labor and delivery, you'll want a way to show your appreciation. First I packed a small baggy of assorted chocolates to give to each of my nurses. By my third birth, I've added Altoids, Chapstick, nice smelling hand sanitizer, and a cute pen to my thank you baggies. I've also heard of people giving gift cards or just one large gift of chocolates to leave at the nurses' station.Show sources Hide sources Lamaze International. 2014.

5 things you didn't know about breastfeeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_5-things-you-didnt-know-about-breastfeeding_10357141.bc,"Amlie Benoist / Science SourceBreastfeeding is like a hike through the woods: Natural, but not always simple. In fact, it can be challenging, breathtaking, and full of the unexpected.Here are the big breastfeeding surprises moms reported to us:The hormones can be intenseIt's the ultimate paradox. Here's this odd-looking creature sporting a belly-button stump, acne, and peeling skin. He can't even hold a decent conversation, let alone get you a cup of coffee  and yet whenever you nurse him, you're filled with head-over-heels devotion. What's up with that? We have one word for you  oxytocin.This powerful hormone is responsible for breast milk ""letting down,"" or moving to the front of the breasts. And it also happens to be the same chemical released in the brain when a person falls in love, says Laura Viehmann, assistant professor of pediatrics at Brown University and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatricians. No wonder you couldn't care less about all that spit-up and poop! You're too busy swooning.Another hormonal effect of nursing  particularly in the newborn period  is a feeling of deep relaxation, which can easily tip over into drowsiness. ""It's the same kind of sleepiness people feel after a big meal,"" Viehmann says. And just like that post-Thanksgiving sedation, it's difficult to resist. ""I can be wide awake and full of energy, but I sit down to breastfeed and I'm half passing out,"" says one mom.5 breastfeeding lessons learnedMoms share their breastfeeding experiences.Viehmann's advice? Recognize that the drowsiness has a purpose and give in to it, even if only for a ten-minute catnap. ""Research shows that mothers who take advantage of these small naps will achieve an extra one to two hours of sleep per day,"" Viehmann says. Just make sure you nurse in a safe place where your baby can't fall or get trapped in a cushion if you doze off.Unfortunately, not all the hormonal effects of nursing are positive. Some women report uncomfortable sensations before or during letdown, such as an uneasy feeling in the stomach, weakness, sweating, and even an odd sense of melancholy. These feelings are often temporary and can be replaced by more positive ones.But if you're concerned about how you're feeling, or if you're having problems with breastfeeding, don't hesitate to check in with your doctor.Breastfeeding helps (some) women lose their pregnancy weightAs your baby grows from a fragile-boned newborn into a delicious butterball, you may notice your own weight dropping. You can thank nursing for transferring those pounds.""Breast milk is a high-fat, high-caloric food,"" says Robert Wool, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts University. ""And the baby basically sucks those calories right out of the mother's body."" Hence, the incredible shrinking mommy. As one mom says, ""The weight just fell off.""However  and unfair as this seems  the nursing weight-loss plan doesn't work for everyone. Some moms find their metabolism slowing to a frustrating crawl. ""I nursed my son for 27 months and it didn't help me lose weight. Then I lost 15 pounds within about two weeks after weaning,"" one mom reports.In fact, in a poll of BabyCenter moms, 40 percent say breastfeeding didn't help them drop pounds while 60 percent say it did. Is there a physiological difference between the two groups?Possibly, says Viehmann, although there's not a lot of research data in this area yet. ""One of the breastfeeding hormones is also involved in digestion. For some nursing women, this hormone may become more efficient, so they don't need as many calories,"" she says.Your breasts can leak  a lotWhen it comes to leakage, your breasts may seem to have tiny minds of their own, particularly in those early postpartum weeks. Like an internal alarm clock, they may dribble  or spray  milk when it's time for a feeding, says nurse and lactation consultant Claudia Perry. They may also leak whenever you hear your baby cry or, for that matter, when you hear any baby cry. Photographs, videos, or just thoughts of your baby can get that dairy faucet pumping.""Even baby animals and babies on television can set me off,"" one mom reports. Another says, ""At first, I couldn't leave the house without nursing pads because I knew the second I saw or heard another baby, or even thought about my baby, I'd leak everywhere.""Once again, oxytocin  the hormone responsible for your letdown reflex  is the culprit. Like a good party host, your body knows that it's better to have too much food available than not enough. While those wet spots on your blouse can be a bit embarrassing, think of the leaking as nature's way of making sure your baby always has enough to eat.Some women, says Perry, have occasional leaking long after they've weaned their babies  sometimes even a year later! It just goes to show that we should never underestimate the power of those hormones.You can be lopsidedFeeling a little uneven? It's not your imagination. Many moms find that one breast consistently produces more milk than the other. If this is the case for you, you can chalk it up to the fact that you have a different number of milk-making ducts on each side. ""Humans aren't perfectly symmetrical,"" says Perry. ""Just as one foot can be bigger than the other, one breast can have more ducts than the other.""Of course, what this means is that the more productive breast may be bigger as well as fuller. Again, this is normal. ""I am completely lopsided! Righty is way bigger than lefty  probably at least a cup size. I call the right side the workhorse,"" says one mom.You can also cause uneven milk production if you feed your baby more from one breast than the other. (The breast you use more will produce more milk.) But if you're giving each breast equal time and still noticing a difference in output, it's likely a duct issue.You can't change the number of ducts you have. The fuller side will probably remain more productive the entire time you nurse your baby  and it will likely be more productive for your next baby as well.Your breast milk is perfectly tailored to your babyImagine if every single time you were hungry, you were served a delectable, satisfying meal that contained the perfect balance of electrolytes, fats, and nutrients for your body at that particular time. Welcome to your baby's world.""The joke is that breast milk is a 'soup to nuts' meal,"" says Miriam Labbock, pediatrician and director of the Carolina Global Breastfeeding Institute at the UNC School of Public Health, meaning it's a full-course feast. ""The first milk is more watery, so it addresses the baby's thirst. As the feeding continues, the milk becomes higher in fat. It's like starting with broth and ending with a hot fudge sundae."" This setup allows your baby to get her electrolyte needs met at the beginning of the feeding and her energy needs met with the creamier milk at the end.In addition, says Labbock, starting with the watery part is easier on the baby. ""This allows the infant to avoid having to fight with the heavy cream right away,"" she says. ""The cream comes only after the milk is flowing nicely.""Amazingly, your breast milk gives your baby exactly what she needs immunologically as well. ""The components of the milk shift so that it always complements whatever antibodies the baby is low on at that particular time,"" Labbock says. This is why breastfeeding can actually keep your baby from getting sick.As if this weren't enough, your breast milk changes throughout the day, with more sedating properties being released in the evening. It also changes as your baby grows older to meet her ever-changing nutritional needs. In short, it's the perfect food. And judging from the look of drunken satisfaction on a well-fed baby's face following a feeding, it tastes pretty good, too.Show sources Hide sources La Leche League International. 2016a.

Gender prediction: Am I having a girl or a boy?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_gender-prediction-am-i-having-a-girl-or-a-boy_10405679.bc,"You're bound to be curious about yourbaby's sex, even if you're waiting until thebirthto find out. Is there really any way to predict whether you're having a boy or a girl?It turns out there is some research suggesting that a couple has a slightly higher chance of conceiving a son or a daughter based on certain factors, like the season in which you got pregnant or whether you or your partner has a stressful job.Keep in mind, much of the scientific evidence here is slight, and some of it is hotly debated by experts. But it's still fun to try to guess. Read on to see what the statistics say for you. (Or try our Chinese gender predictor.)Signs you're having a boyYou may be slightly more likely to be carrying a boy if:You and your partner are married or living togetherOne large study looking at data from 48 million births in the United States found that married couples are more likely to give birth to sons.Another study of 86,000 parents showed that couples who were living together when theyconceivedwere slightly more likely to have a boy.Just over half (51.5 percent) of couples living together when they conceived (or at the time of their first prenatal appointment) had a boy, compared with 49.9 per cent of those who were living apart. The study's authors had no theory on why living together resulted in more boys.You've been living together for less than a yearIf your relationship is still new and exciting, you're more likely to be havinglots of sex and frequentsexmay give male sperm a slight advantage.Why? Male sperm are lighter and have smaller heads and shorter tails. This allows them to swim more easily through the slightly lesshospitable mucus in your vagina at the beginning and the end of yourfertile window. Some experts think that female sperm are more likely to reach the egg in the middle of your fertile period.So if you're having frequent sex, you have higher odds of having sex during both the start and end of your fertile window, when male sperm have a slight advantage.You eat wellOne study divided 740 British women into groups according to theircaloric intake. Of the women who had the highest daily intake (about 2,413 calories), 56 percent had boys. Of the women who had the lowest intake (about 2,283 calories), only 45 percent had boys.Another study looked at 68 million births and found that women who gained more weight during pregnancy were more likely to be having boys.Male fetuses are more fragile and are statistically less likely to be conceived or survive pregnancy whenfoodis in short supply. Female sperm are more robust and baby girls are hardier early in pregnancy, so in leaner times they may be more able to survive.You conceived in the summerIn some countries, more boys are conceived in the summerand more girls are conceived in winter.This may be because more viral and bacterial infections are around in the winter. As male sperm and embryos are more fragile, they may be less able to withstand the mother's catching an infectionthan female embryos.You have gestational diabetesWomen carrying boys have a higher risk of developing gestational diabetes. Exactly why isn't clear, but it's possible that male fetuses interfere with cell functioning that affects glucose metabolism.Signs you're having a girlYou may be slightly more likely to be carrying a girl if:You're over 35 years old and the dad-to-be is over 40 years oldTheolder the dadandmom, the more likely female sperm are to fertilize the egg. This could be due to hormonal changes in the woman as she ages. And older men produce fewer male sperm.Or it could be that older couples are more likely to have sex in the middle of the fertile period, when female sperm may have the edge over male sperm.You suffer badly from morning sicknessYou're slightly more likely to have a baby girl if you havesevere morning sickness(hyperemesis gravidarum).A review of 13 studies found that 55 per cent of babies born to women who'd had severe morning sickness were girls. This was compared to 49 percent in the control group who didn't suffer from it. Some experts think that this is due to high levels of the hormone estrogen, which is linked withmorning sickness.It's very hot  or cold  where you liveA study of Japanese births from 1968 to 2012 found that more girls were conceived during a particularly hot summer in 2010, and again during an extremely cold winter in 2011.Other research has shown that warm temperatures appear linked to girl babies. And a global survey of birth data showed that more girls are born in the tropics (the region around the equator) than anywhere else in the world.One theory is that weather extremes cause stress. In addition to the uncomfortable temperatures, very hot or cold places tend to have poor nutrition, high levels of pollutants, and insufficient or excessive sunlight. Such stress is especially hard on male fetuses, which are more fragile than female fetuses in the earliest months of pregnancy.Your job is stressfulWomen working in mentally stressful jobs outside the home may be more likely to have a girl. A study looking at more than 16,000 births in a British hospital found that among women with jobs considered highly stressful, 53 percent had a daughter. In comparison, 46 percent of women with jobs considered less stressful had a daughter.The dad-to-be's job involves pollutants or stressA few studies have looked at thedad's occupationand the baby's gender. They found that dads with jobs that involve stress or pollutants seem to end up with more girls.Though they were small-scale studies that looked only at certain occupations, dads with the following jobs had more girls than average:professional driverdeep-sea diversubmarine sonar technicianflour mill workerhigh-performance pilotYou conceived after hormonally induced ovulationSome studies carried out among women who used hormones to induce ovulation show that you are slightly more likely to have a girl if artificial hormones, such asclomiphene, are involved. However, other experts aren't convinced.You already have two or more childrenIt's possible that the more children you have, the more likely you are to have a girl. This may be due to the fact that the more pregnancies you have, the higher your levels of the hormone gonadotrophin. Some experts have claimed that these higher hormonal levels could be linked to an increased chance of having a girl.You're past your due dateMoms who give birth to girls tend to have slightly longer pregnancies. Boys are more likely to be born before their due date. After the 40-week mark, however, the odds slightly favor a girl.More about babies and genderGet an inside look at how girls and boys develop.Can parents choose to have a boy or a girl?

BabyCenter® and Men's Health Survey Reveals That Today's Dad Looks a Lot Like Mom,https://www.babycenter.com/0_babycenter-174-and-mens-health-survey-reveals-that-todays-da_10415036.bc,"Contact:Nicole Centinaro / Sue MurphyCoyne Public Relations973.588.200061 Percent of Dads Put Family Before WorkNearly Half of Dads Say Being Involved Isnt a Trend, Its the New Norm(San Francisco)  June 12, 2013 - Just in time for Fathers Day, BabyCenter, the #1 pregnancy and parenting mobile and web destination worldwide, and Mens Health, the largest mens magazine in the world, have redefined the 2013 dad. According to a recent joint survey, 84 percent of dads consider themselves an involved dad who does more than half of the parenting and nearly half of dads today say that being an involved dad isnt just a trend, its the new normal. However, 34 percent of dads feel they do not receive the respect they deserve, particularly in the media.Hopefully this is the last dad trend story youll ever read. Being an involved dad isnt a fad, its the way things are for todays families, says Linda Murray, BabyCenters Global Editor in Chief. Young families are no longer hung up on gender roles when it comes to parenting tasks. Dads are taking kids to the doctor and polishing nails, and moms are coaching soccer and paying the bills. In our survey, this sea change in parenting roles was strongest among dads under 30. This isnt just a trend  we have a new definition of fatherhood and thats great news for the whole family.We can now officially toss out the stereotypical image of dads who work all day, come home to a full-course meal, and then put their feet up, says Peter Moore, editor of Mens Health. Thats history. Todays dad takes an active, hands-on role in the family, and he is proud of it. Dads are parenting, not babysitting.The survey revealed interesting insights about the modern dad, among them:Family Comes FirstYou wont find todays dad hanging back. Seventy-nine percent of dads are involved in the bedtime routine, 63 percent are involved in bath time, 60 percent help with pick-ups and drop-offs from daycare and school, and 58 percent take part in doctor appointments. And while work is a necessity, its not a priority anymore. Sixty-one percent of dads put their family before work, and 75 percent make it home for dinner as often as they can.Dads say its important for them to be a great dad and have a close relationship with their children, and according to the survey, this mindset starts at birth. More than half of dads take up to two weeks off from work after the birth of their child, and nearly 3 out of 4 dads were at home helping with household chores and tending to the baby in the first few days following a childs birth, an increase of 180 percent since 2006. Additionally, dads are more worried about a new babys health and less about finances and lack of free time than seven years ago.Quality Time Is KeyThe dads surveyed say that spending time with children (94 percent) and being a positive role model (91 percent) top the list of qualities they feel are the most important in being a good father. Dads claim the time they spend with their kids centers around play (94 percent), family dinnertime (75 percent),and their kids various activities (71 percent). Interestingly, half of the dads surveyed say they spend more time with their kids than their own dad spent with them growing up.Its Still a Joint EffortWhile dads are more involved than ever before, they are not doing it all on their own. Four out of 5 dads say they are involved in half of the childcare. And more than 62 percent of couples both have careers and care about their children equally. Parents are also splitting the household duties  Dad handles the home and car maintenance while Mom takes care of the shopping.He Said, She SaidWhile dads have a more hands-on approach to parenting these days, there is still some gray area as to who really does the majority of the work. Dads definitely have a different view of themselves than their partner does. Dads are 50 percent more likely to say they do the laundry than moms report; 3 in 5 dads say they are responsible for preparing meals while 2 in 5 moms say dads do so; 45 percent of dads say they are primarily responsible for managing the finances but moms say only 28 percent of dads do it alone.Baby Brings Couples CloserBruce Feiler, author of The New York Times best seller The Secrets of Happy Families: Improve Your Mornings, Rethink Family Dinner, Fight Smarter, Go Out and Play, and Much More, shared his survey insights with BabyCenter, noting that younger fathers feel that a baby strengthens the relationship they have with their partner.The impact of having a baby on Mom and Dads relationship also shows a key generational shift, says Feiler in a recent BabyCenter article. When asked if having a child drew them closer to their spouse or instead increased stress, 20 percent of dads over 40 said it drew them closer to their spouse, while a third said instead it increased stress on the relationship. However, for dads under 30, the numbers were reversed. This trend suggests the long-held belief that children were a drag on relationships may be changing with younger parents.For more information on the survey and to read Bruce Feilers full piece, please visit: www.babycenter.com/dads-today. ###About BabyCenter LLCBabyCenter is the worlds partner in parenting.

Managing depression during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_managing-depression-during-pregnancy_10415698.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineDepression during pregnancy can feel very isolating, but you're far from alone: About 1 in 10 women have depression during and after pregnancy. And the actual number could be even higher because many women with depression are reluctant to ask for help.Although you may worry now that you're expecting, depression during pregnancy is very treatable. Taking action to get help may be difficult, but it's the first step to recovery. Here's what you need to know.How do I get help for depression during pregnancy?If you're not yet being treated for depression, talk to your healthcare provider. She can screen you for depression and anxiety then refer you to a maternal-fetal medicine or another specialist if necessary. A range of mental health professionals can help you, including:PsychiatristsPsychologistsSocial workersPsychiatric nursesCounselorsWhich type of professional you see depends on your needs and preferences as well as the cost. Check your health plan to find out what's covered.If you're already being treated for depression but still feel low, your provider may need to adjust your medication or change your treatment plan. Having a relapse during pregnancy is common, especially if you've stopped taking your medication. You might even notice the first signs of postpartum depression during pregnancy.Whatever your treatment, healthcare professionals will work with you to ensure you and your baby get the best care possible.What's the treatment for depression during pregnancy?Your options depend on how severe your depression is. Your treatment may include talk therapy, medication, or both.Talk therapy is usually tried before starting medication, but your insurance may not cover it. Check your plan to find out.Talk therapyTalk therapy is regular appointments to discuss your thoughts, feelings, or behavior with a mental health professional. It's likely you'll meet once a week for 12 to 16 sessions. You may talk with a therapist individually or participate in a group with other people going through a similar experience. Common types of talk therapy include:Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). CBT alters patterns of negative thinking or behavior to change the way you feel. CBT teaches you to identify distorted thinking, recognize inaccurate beliefs, and help you see yourself and relate to others more positively. Some therapists use relaxation techniques, like mindful meditation, as part of the process.Couples, family, or interpersonal therapy (IPT). These types of therapies are similar and help when relationships suffer because of depression, or if problems in relationships contribute to the condition. A therapist helps a partner or relatives understand depression and how to help a loved one with the condition. Couples and family members come up with ways to support each other, and patients learn to help a partner cope better with the illness. Improving these relationships makes it easier to get support.CBT and IPT are often effective for treating mild to moderate depression, but if talk therapy alone doesn't work, your provider may recommend medication as well.Antidepressant medicationThere are a lot of medications available to treat depression, and many are considered safe to take during pregnancy. It takes between three to four weeks for antidepressants to take effect, though some people start to feel better after just a week or two.Your provider may recommend antidepressant medication if depression stops you from functioning in your daily life and you're struggling to cope. Antidepressants might also be a good option if:You tried talk therapy and it didn't work.You tried stopping or lowering your dose of antidepressants and your symptoms returned.You have another mental health condition in addition to depression, such as bipolar disorder or panic disorder.In extreme cases, if your depression is making you suicidal or psychotic (including delusions and hallucinations), you'll be referred to a psychiatrist for emergency medication.The first time you take an antidepressant you may experience side effects, such as an upset stomach, nausea, or trouble sleeping, but these usually go away after a few weeks. To monitor your progress, your provider should check in with you often, either in person or by phone.Deciding whether to take antidepressants during pregnancy can be difficult. Taking antidepressants during pregnancy isn't entirely risk-free, but the risk is fairly low. These drugs can cross the placenta and problems are possible, though rare. They may increase the likelihood that a baby will have problems such as being born early. But not treating your depression effectively can be harmful too. Your depression could get worse and make it hard for you to care for yourself, which would also affect your baby.Ask your provider to explain the pros and cons of your treatment options and answer any questions you have. Knowing more about the safety of taking antidepressants during pregnancy may help you decide what to do.Electroconvulsive TherapyElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) involves having an electric current passed through the brain to induce a controlled seizure. ECT is considered safe and effective for chronic depression, but isn't usually recommended during pregnancy unless a woman has a very severe case of depression or depression-related psychosis. There's limited research on the effects of ECT during pregnancy, so it's used only when other treatments don't work.Do alternative therapies help depression?It's hard to know. Most providers will tell you that there's not enough evidence to show that alternative therapies are effective for treating depression during pregnancy. Sometimes this just means that not enough research has been done to draw any definite conclusions about a particular therapy.Safety is an issue, depending on the alternative therapy. This can be a real concern, especially if the therapy involves ingesting a substance that could be harmful to you and your baby. And some alternative therapies are expensive, so it may be good advice not to waste your money.Still, some women swear that alternative therapies are helpful for managing depression during pregnancy, and some options are less risky than others. If you're interested in learning more about certain alternative therapies before trying one, you may want to talk to your provider about:Acupuncture. In this therapy, an acupuncturist gently places needles into your skin at specific points on your body that correspond to specific organs. Some studies suggest that acupuncture may be beneficial for treating depression, and acupuncture with a qualified therapist is safe during pregnancy.Light therapy. This involves sitting in front of a bright white light for a period of time each day. It's typically used to treat seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression that tends to occur in the fall and winter months when the days are shorter and there's less daylight.Massage. If you've ever had a massage, you know that it can help you feel relaxed. It's possible that getting a massage regularly, either from your partner or a massage therapist, could also help relieve depression. Meditation. Research suggests that mindfulness meditation can help you regulate your emotions, increase self-awareness, and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Mindfulness meditation involves being present in the moment by focusing attention on your breath and your thoughts.Yoga. Yoga combines stretching poses, breathing, and meditation, and, like any type of exercise, can relieve stress and make you feel better. Learn how to do yoga safely during pregnancy.What else can help me cope with depression?In addition to following your treatment plan, taking care of yourself physically and emotionally is the best thing you can do. You may find it hard, but figuring out what makes you feel even a little bit better will ease your symptoms and help you cope. Here are some things to try:Get support. Sharing your feelings with your partner, friends, and family can help you feel better. They may be able to offer some perspective or practical help, and you may also find that simply talking about your emotions makes them seem more manageable. Ask your provider about local support groups.Take time to relax. Stress is a common trigger for depression, so try to take a break when you can. Having lunch with your partner, listening to music, or taking a calming bath can lift your mood. It can sometimes be difficult to find time to relax, especially if you already have children or work outside the home. So accept any help that allows you to take a little time to yourself.Protect your sleep. Pregnancy and depression can both disrupt your sleep. Give yourself the best odds of getting a good night's rest by cutting back on caffeine (especially in the afternoon and evening), being active during the day, and not eating a heavy meal just before bed.Eat healthy and stay hydrated. Eat regular meals with healthy snacks in between to boost your energy and give your baby the nutrition he needs to grow. Drink plenty of water or noncaffeinated drinks to stay hydrated.Exercise. Exercise can alleviate depression because the brain releases feel-good chemicals that boost your mood. Go for a leisurely stroll, take a swim, or try some pregnancy yoga. Talk to your provider first before starting any exercise regimen.When should I call my healthcare provider?If you feel like you can't cope, or if your symptoms are getting worse, call your provider. Also contact your provider immediately if:It's hard to perform tasks at work or at home.You're struggling to take care of yourself.You have thoughts of harming yourself or others.If you're in crisis and feel as if you can't go on, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at (800) 273-TALK (8255). It's a toll-free number and is available 24 hours a day, seven days a week.The service is available to everyone. You'll be connected to a trained counselor in your area, and all calls are confidential.What if I'm afraid to ask for help?If you're not quite ready to talk to your provider, consider reaching out to moms in the BabyCenter Community. You can post anonymously and share how you feel with other women experiencing depression during pregnancy. Connecting with those who understand what you're going through might give you the courage to pick up the phone and call your provider.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2016.

Breastfeeding: Getting started,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-getting-started_465.bc,"How to start breastfeedingThe first time you hold your newborn in the delivery room is a great time to start breastfeeding. At the beginning, your body will produce small amounts of a special milk called colostrum that will help protect your baby from infection. (Your baby's tummy is very tiny, so she only needs these small amounts to fill up. As her tummy grows, your milk will change and you'll produce more of it.)Turn your baby's whole body toward you, chest to chest. Touch her upper lip with your nipple, and, when she opens her mouth wide, pull her onto your breast, holding your breast for support. Her mouth should cover not just the nipple but as much of the areola (the darker part surrounding it) as possible.Don't panic if your newborn seems to have trouble finding or staying on your nipple. Breastfeeding requires patience and lots of practice. Don't hesitate to ask a nurse to show you what to do, and request visits from a lactation consultant while you're in the hospital (many hospitals have them on staff).If you have a premature baby, you may not be able to nurse right away, but you should start pumping your milk. Your baby will receive this milk through a tube or a bottle until she's strong enough to nurse.How to get a comfy attachment for breastfeeding Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:01Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:01Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosOnce you get started, remember that nursing shouldn't be painful. Pay attention to how your breasts feel when your baby latches on. Her mouth should cover a big part of the areola below the nipple, and your nipple should be far back in your baby's mouth.If latch-on hurts, break the suction (by inserting your little finger between your baby's gums and your breast) and try again. Once your baby latches on properly, she'll do the rest.How often you should nurseFrequently. The more you nurse, the more milk you'll produce. Nursing eight to 12 times every 24 hours is pretty much on target.According to guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), rather than nursing according to a rigid schedule, you should nurse your newborn whenever she shows early signs of hunger, such as increased alertness or activity, mouthing, or rooting around for your nipple. Crying is a late sign of hunger  ideally, you should start feeding your baby before she starts crying.During the first few days, you may have to gently wake your baby to begin nursing, and she may fall asleep again mid-feeding. (To keep her awake during feedings, you may want to unswaddle her or remove a layer of clothing.) To make sure your baby's eating often enough, wake her up if it's been four hours since your last nursing session.How to get comfortableSince feedings can take up to 40 minutes, especially in the newborn months, pick a cozy spot for nursing. Hold your baby in a position that won't leave your arms and back sore. It works well to support the back of your baby's head with your hand, but the position you choose really depends on what's comfortable for you.If you're sitting, a nursing pillow can be a big help in supporting your baby. Many moms also find a footstool helps them get comfy. Whether you're sitting or lying down, don't start the feeding until you and your baby are comfortable because you'll be in that position for a while.5 simple breastfeeding positions Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:47Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:47Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosWhat you should eatA normal healthy diet is all you need while you're nursing. Although you can produce milk for your baby even if your nutrition isn't up to par, eating a well-balanced diet will ensure that the quantity and quality of your milk is all it can be and will help you feel your best. Follow your hunger rather than counting calories, and drink fluids throughout the day to stay well hydrated.Many moms feel extra hungry while breastfeeding, which makes sense  your body is working around the clock to make breast milk for your baby. Eating small meals with healthy snacks in between (the way you may have done during pregnancy) is a good way to keep your hunger in check and your energy level high. (As a general guideline, most women who are breastfeeding will need about 200 to 500 calories more than moms who aren't.)Don't overdo your caffeine consumption, because you'll pass the caffeine along to your baby in your breast milk and it can accumulate in her system. (Experts recommend limiting your intake to no more than 300 mg per day, about the amount you'd get in a 12-ounce cup of coffee).You'll also want to limit drinking alcohol while you're breastfeeding, because it also enters your breast milk.Most nursing babies don't mind if Mom indulges in spicy foods. In fact, some experts believe that babies enjoy some variety. No foods are problematic for all babies, so there's no need to restrict what you eat right away. But if your baby seems more gassy or irritable every time you eat a particular food (dairy products, for example), try eliminating the suspect food for a while to see if she's better off without them in her breast milk.Problems you may encounterSome women adjust to breastfeeding easily, encountering no major physical or emotional hurdles. But many new moms find it hard to learn. If you're feeling discouraged, .It's normal to feel overwhelmed by your baby's constant demands and exhausted from lack of sleep. And you may have questions: Is my baby getting enough milk? Should I have sore nipples? How long should my baby nurse? Should I wake her if she falls asleep nursing?Although women have nursed their babies for centuries, breastfeeding doesn't always come easily. Many women face difficulties early on. Some of the most common breastfeeding problems you may encounter in the first six weeks include:engorgement (breasts that are excessively full and uncomfortable)sore nipplesmastitis (a breast infection)Don't suffer in silence. Call your healthcare provider or a lactation consultant if you're suffering from any of the above, if you're in pain, or if physical discomfort is getting in the way of nursing.Breastfeeding Problem SolverFind solutions to a variety of breastfeeding challenges, including nipple pain, low milk supply, and more.Where to get helpBreastfeeding help and support is just a phone call (or a click) away.Talk to your doctor or midwife about any health concerns that may be getting in the way of successful breastfeeding.La Leche League International, an organization that offers encouragement and support to women who want to breastfeed their babies, can send you information or put you in touch with a La Leche League chapter near you. You can reach the group's headquarters or get advice from its breastfeeding hotline by calling (800) 525-3243. If you attend local meetings, you can meet other new moms and get breastfeeding assistance.For professional advice and encouragement, call an international board-certified lactation consultant (IBCLC). A lactation consultant can offer advice on how to breastfeed properly and give you hands-on help. To find one near you, call the International Lactation Consultant Association at (919) 861-5577 or use that association's online lactation consultant finder.You can also call the hospital or birth center where you delivered, your doctor or midwife, or your child's doctor for a referral.For support from other breastfeeding moms, visit the Breastfeeding support and help group in BabyCenter's Community.For more information, see BabyCenter's Breastfeeding area.Show sources Hide sources Cincinnati Children's Hospital.

How to tell whether your baby's getting enough breast milk,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-tell-whether-your-babys-getting-enough-breast-milk_617.bc,"New moms just getting used to breastfeeding sometimes worry that their baby isn't getting enough milk. After all, every mom wants to make sure that her baby is getting all the nourishment needed, but it's impossible to see how much milk a nursing baby actually drinks.What are the signs that my baby is getting enough breast milk?Your breastfeeding baby is probably getting enough nourishment if:Your breasts feel softer after nursing (because your baby has emptied some of the milk that was making them firm).Your baby seems relaxed and satisfied after a feeding.Your baby continues to gain weight after gaining back the weight she initially lost after birth. (Most babies lose up to 7 percent of their birth weight and then regain it by the time they're about 2 weeks old.) A rough guideline: Your baby should gain about 6 to 8 ounces a week for the first four months, then about 4 to 6 ounces per week from 4 to 7 months.Your baby wets at least six diapers a day after your milk comes in. In the first few days, when your baby is getting only your thick, nutrient-rich colostrum, she may have only one or two wet diapers a day. But after your baby starts getting regular breast milk, she'll start having a lot more wet diapers.In the first month, your baby has at least three stools a day, and they lighten to a yellowy mustard color within five to seven days after birth. She may have less frequent bowel movements once she's a month old or skip bowel movements for several days now and then. Once she's eating solid foods, at 4 to 6 months, she'll probably go back to having at least one bowel movement a day.Signs your breastfed baby is eating enough Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 4:44Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -4:44Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosWhat are the signs that my baby isn't getting enough breast milk?Watch for these signs if you're concerned about your baby's milk intake:Your baby continues to lose weight. If your baby doesn't start gaining weight after five days, or if he starts losing weight again any time after that, talk with his doctor.Your baby is wetting fewer than six diapers in a 24-hour period after the five days following his birth.Your baby has small, dark stools after his first five days.Your baby's urine is very dark, like the color of apple juice. (If his urine is pale or clear, he's getting enough liquid. If it's more concentrated, it may be a sign that he's low on fluids.)Your baby is fussy or lethargic much of the time. He may fall asleep as soon as you put him to your breast but then fuss when you take him off.Your baby appears to have a dry mouth or eyes.Your baby just doesn't seem satisfied, even if feedings consistently take longer than an hour.Your breasts don't feel softer after nursing.You rarely hear your baby swallow while nursing. (Some babies are very quiet feeders, so if all other signs are positive, don't worry about this one!)What happens if my baby doesn't get enough breast milk?Although most moms are able to provide their babies with all the milk they need, sometimes babies don't get enough. And when the problem isn't addressed, a baby can suffer from dehydration and failure to thrive, which are uncommon but serious problems.If you're concerned that your baby isn't getting enough milk, call your baby's doctor or check in with a nurse or lactation consultant. At these appointments, you'll typically feed your baby while the consultant observes you and gives you valuable tips for breastfeeding success.Breastfeeding Problem SolverFind solutions to a variety of breastfeeding challenges, including nipple pain, low milk supply, and more.How often will my baby breastfeed?There's a very wide range of what's considered normal. Some babies like to nurse all the time  not just for nourishment, but also for enjoyment  while others nurse only when prompted by their tummy. Your baby may be too sleepy to nurse much in the first 24 hours. But after that, here's what's typical:1 to 7 weeksEvery 2 to 3 hours8 to 12 times dailyThis might seem like a lot  and make you wonder whether she's getting enough at each feeding  but keep in mind that your new baby has a tiny tummy and needs frequent refills.2 to 5 monthsEvery 2 1/2 to 3 1/2 hours7 to 9 times dailyAs she grows bigger and gets more efficient at breastfeeding, she'll go longer between feedings and spend less time overall at your breast.6 months and beyondEvery 5 to 6 hours4 to 5 times dailyAnd at this age, here she may stay for as long as you continue to nurse her.How much breast milk do I need to pump?If you pump your breast milk for your baby, you can follow these guidelines to know how much he'll need:Up until they're about 1 month old, most babies will take 2 1/2 to 3 ounces of breast milk in a bottle, feeding about eight times a day  that's taking in a total of 20 to 24 ounces in 24 hours.By 6 months, your baby will most likely be drinking 24 to 30 ounces a day, divided into six to eight feedings. He'll start drinking a little less once he starts eating solid food.Keep in mind that these are just rough guidelines  don't try to get your 6-month-old to drink 30 ounces each day if he doesn't want to.Is it possible to overfeed a baby?Yes, if you're bottle feeding, it's easy to give a baby too much formula or breast milk. A breastfed baby can comfort herself at the breast while getting just a minimal amount of milk, or drink just enough to quench her thirst, but it isn't that easy for a bottle-fed baby. If your bottle-fed baby wants just a little milk, she usually winds up getting much more because of how fast the milk flows through the nipple of a bottle.How can I prevent overfeeding my baby with a bottle?To help your baby get just the right amount of milk, bottle-feed him slowly and take little breaks to give him a chance to let you know when he's had enough. If your baby seems to be gulping the breast milk quickly, help him catch his breath by taking a break every 10 sucks or so. This is especially important during the first couple of months, until he learns to pace himself.As babies start eating more solid foods, they start taking in less breast milk. As your baby nears his first birthday, he might drink breast milk three to four times a day.Once your baby is a 1 year old, he can transition to whole cow's milk in a bottle or sippy cup. Keep in mind that while cow's milk is good for him, you don't want to overdo it or he won't have much appetite for other healthy foods. (Too much cow's milk can also lead to iron-deficiency anemia.) Sixteen to 24 ounces a day should be just fine.And of course, you can continue to nurse past age 1 if you and your child want to. Even though your toddler will get most of his nutrition from solid food, breast milk still provides calories, immune protection, vitamins, and enzymes.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012.

Iron in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-in-your-pregnancy-diet_1468.bc,"Why you need iron during pregnancyEven before you're pregnant, your body needs iron for several reasons:It's essential for making hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to other cells.It's an important component of myoglobin (a protein that helps supply oxygen to your muscles), collagen (a protein in bone, cartilage, and other connective tissue), and many enzymes.It helps maintain a healthy immune system.But during pregnancy you need a lot more of this essential mineral. Here's why:The amount of blood in your body increases during pregnancy until you have almost 50 percent more blood than usual. You need extra iron to make more hemoglobin.You need extra iron for your growing baby and placenta, especially in the second and third trimesters.Many women need more because they start their pregnancy with insufficient stores of iron.Iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy is associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight, and infant mortality.How much iron you needPregnant women: 27 milligrams (mg) of iron per dayNonpregnant women: 18 mgYou don't have to get the recommended amount of iron every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Food sources of ironThere are two forms of iron: heme and non-heme. Heme iron is found only in animal sources and is easier for your body to absorb. Non-heme iron is found in plants, iron-fortified foods, and supplements. Red meat, poultry, and seafood contain both heme and non-heme iron. To make sure you're getting enough, eat a variety of iron-rich foods every day.Red meat, poultry, and fish are some of the best sources of iron. (Liver supplies a very high concentration of iron, but it also contains unsafe amounts of vitamin A, so it's best to limit it to one or two servings a month during pregnancy.) If your diet doesn't include animal protein, you can get iron from legumes, vegetables, and grains.Strawberry and asparagus salad Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 4:02Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -4:02Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Adding just a little meat or fish to a meal helps your body absorb more of the iron in the other foods on your plate.Here are a few more tips for getting as much iron as possible from your diet:Cook in a cast iron pan. Moist, acidic foods, such as tomato sauce, are especially good at soaking up iron this way.Include a source of vitamin C (like orange juice, strawberries, or broccoli) with every meal, especially when eating vegetarian sources of iron, like beans  the vitamin C can help you absorb up to six times more iron.Many healthy foods contain ""iron inhibitors,"" which are naturally occurring substances that can interfere with iron absorption. Examples of iron inhibitors include phytates in whole grains and legumes, polyphenols in coffee and tea, oxalates in soy foods and spinach, and calcium in dairy products.If you have low iron or iron-deficiency anemia, some experts believe you shouldn't eat iron-inhibiting foods at the same time as iron-rich foods. Others believe it's okay to eat these foods together as long as your overall diet includes plenty of iron-rich and vitamin C-rich foods. Your provider or a dietitian can work with you to create a prenatal nutrition plan that supports healthy iron levels.If your provider has prescribed iron supplements, take them one hour before or two hours after meals because iron is absorbed most easily on an empty stomach. Taking the supplement with orange juice  which is high in iron-enhancing vitamin C  can boost absorption. (But don't take your iron pill with milk, coffee, or tea because these can interfere with iron absorption.)Calcium also hinders iron absorption, so if your provider has recommended you take both an iron and a calcium supplement (or antacids that contain calcium), ask for advice on how to space them out during the day.Should you take an iron supplement?Although your body absorbs iron more efficiently during pregnancy, you might not get enough of the mineral from your diet. Many women start their pregnancy without enough iron to meet their body's increased demands and are unable to bring their levels up through diet alone.At your first prenatal appointment, your healthcare provider will probably recommend a prenatal vitamin with about 30 mg of iron. Unless you have (or develop) anemia, this should be sufficient, so don't take additional supplements unless your provider advises you to.What happens if you don't get enough ironWhen you don't get enough iron, your stores become depleted over time. And if you no longer have enough iron to make the hemoglobin you need, you become anemic.Iron-deficiency anemia can sap your energy and cause many other symptoms, especially if you have a severe case. It can also make it harder for your body to fight infection.It may even impact your pregnancy: Iron-deficiency anemia  especially in early or midpregnancy  has been linked to a greater risk of preterm birth, having a low-birth-weight baby, and fetal or newborn death. See our complete article on iron-deficiency anemia.If you're anemic when you give birth, you're more likely to need a transfusion and have other problems if you lose a lot of blood at delivery. And some research suggests an association between maternal iron deficiency and postpartum depression.Your baby does a good job of taking care of his iron needs while he's in your uterus. He'll get his share of what's available before you do. That said, if you're severely anemic, it may compromise your baby's iron stores at birth, raising his risk for anemia later in infancy and possibly hurting his growth and cognitive development.Can you get too much iron?Yes. Aim to get no more than 45 milligrams of iron a day. If you take more than that (either from an extra iron supplement or from your prenatal vitamin), it can cause your blood levels of iron to rise too high, possibly causing problems for you and your baby.For example, too much iron can increase your risk of developing gestational diabetes or oxidative stress, an imbalance in the body that's thought to play a role in infertility, preeclampsia, and miscarriage, and has been linked to heart disease and high blood pressure. Take iron supplements during pregnancy only under the supervision of your healthcare provider.Side effects of iron supplementsIron supplements can upset your gastrointestinal tract. The most common complaint is constipation, which is already a problem for many pregnant women. Try drinking prune juice if you're constipated. It can help you stay regular  and is actually a good source of iron!You may also have nausea or (more rarely) diarrhea. If your supplement makes you feel queasy, try taking it with a small snack or at bedtime.Talk to your provider if you're experiencing other side effects  if you're not anemic and your prenatal vitamin has more than 30 mg of iron, it may make sense for you to switch to one with a lower dose.If you are anemic, you may be able to prevent stomach problems by starting with a supplement that has less iron and gradually building up to the dose you need. You could also try taking the iron in smaller doses throughout the day. Your provider may suggest trying different iron supplements to find one that's easy on your stomach. For example, some moms-to-be have fewer side effects from a timed-release iron supplement, although the trade-off is that the iron isn't absorbed as well this way.Finally, don't worry if your stools look darker when you start taking iron. That's a normal and harmless side effect.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015. Nutrition during pregnancy.

Growth charts: Taking your baby's measurements,https://www.babycenter.com/0_growth-charts-taking-your-babys-measurements_1620.bc,"What are growth charts?At each checkup, the doctor or nurse measures your baby's length, weight, and head circumference, and then marks those numbers on a chart of normal ranges for babies of the same age and sex. In the end, you'll find out what percentile your child is in. (The most recent charts take into account both breastfed and formula-fed babies.)Growth charts show the full range of a child's growth at a specific age. For instance, a length chart for a 2-month-old girl shows the range from shortest to longest. If your 2-month-old daughter is in the 50th percentile, that means she falls right in the middle and is average length for her age.If your baby was born prematurely, the doctor takes that into account by using gestational age to plot her numbers on the chart. For example, if your baby was born 4 weeks early, her numbers are compared with full-term babies who are 4 weeks younger than her.Parents sometimes worry needlessly about these percentages. Percentile ratings in a growth chart aren't like grades in school. A lower percentile rating doesn't mean there is anything wrong with your child.Let's say both parents are shorter than average and their child grows up to be relatively short, too. It would be perfectly normal for that child to consistently rank in the 10th percentile for height as she grows up.Percentile measurements are a general guide to help you and your doctor assess your baby's growth. What's important is that your baby's growth is progressing.Remember that your child is an individual and develops at her own pace. There's a wide range of healthy shapes and sizes among children. Genetics, how active your baby is, health problems, and nutrition are just some of the factors that can influence growth.What are doctors looking for?Your child follows a particular growth curve and your doctor checks to make sure he stays on that curve. Your practitioner makes sure your baby is gaining weight appropriately (no big dips, for example), and keeps an eye on his weight to make sure it isn't excessive for his length. (That might indicate potential weight problems down the road.)Growth CalculatorSee how your baby compares to others in height, weight, and head size.Instead of singling out one percentile number, your baby's doctor looks at these measurements together to see an overall growth pattern. Sometimes natural growth spurts or slow-downs can make the numbers vary a bit, but usually your child will be in roughly the same percentile for length and weight as he grows.A few different growth patterns can signal a problem. For instance, if your baby is in the 10th percentile for length and the 90th percentile for weight, his weight could be an issue. It means that he's longer (or taller) than 10 percent of the babies his age, but he weighs more than 90 percent of them. He may go through a growth spurt that puts him back at an appropriate length-to-weight ratio, or his doctor may want to look into why his weight is a little high.Likewise, if your baby has consistently registered around the 60th percentile for weight at all of his checkups and then his next checkup finds him in the 30th percentile for weight, your doctor will probably want to see if there's a reason he's not growing at the same pace he was before.Doctors typically use different growth charts, depending on your child's age. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggests that doctors use the World Health Organization's charts for the first two years of your baby's life to get the latest and most accurate information.Once your child turns 2, your doctor will probably use the CDC's growth charts.All of the charts show length (or height) in both inches and centimeters, and weight in both pounds and kilograms. How does the doctor take my baby's measurements?Because an inch or a pound can make a pretty significant difference in where your baby falls on the charts, your child is measured very carefully. It can be tricky to get reliable and accurate numbers  especially if your baby is very squirmy!  but most doctors and nurses are experienced at it.The doctor or nurse takes three measurements:WeightAfter you undress your baby completely  that's right, no diaper  the doctor or nurse places her on a scale (either a traditional beam scale or an electronic model). Weight is measured in pounds to the closest ounce or in kilograms to the nearest tenth of a kilo.Length (height)While your child is lying down, the doctor or nurse measures her from the top of her head to the bottom of her heel. Some doctors use a special device with a headboard and a movable footboard for more accurate results.Head circumferenceTo measure your baby's head, the doctor or nurse places a flexible measuring tape where your baby's head has the largest circumference  just above the eyebrows and ears, and around the back of the head where it slopes up prominently from the neck.Why does the size of your baby's head matter? Because the size of her skull reflects the growth of her brain.So if a baby's brain isn't growing and developing normally, her head circumference may not be increasing as it should. On the other hand, if the skull grows too quickly, it could be a sign of a problem like hydrocephalus (the buildup of fluid in the brain). Both conditions are unlikely, but important to rule out.By the way, babies' heads are disproportionately large compared to adults' heads, so don't worry if your baby's head looks big to you. Consider your own proportions, too: If you or your partner has a large or small head, your baby might, too. Can I track my baby's growth at home?Yes, though doing it yourself may not be as accurate as when the doctor or nurse does it. However, sometimes parents pick up on mistakes made at the doctor's office or catch growth problems sooner. If you want to give it a try:Weigh your baby. If you don't have a baby scale, any accurate scale will do. Simply hold your baby and get on the scale. Write down that number. Then put your baby down and get on the scale alone. Subtract that number from your combined weight to get your baby's approximate weight.Measure your baby's length. Lay him down and stretch a measuring tape from the top of his head to the bottom of his heel. It's easiest if you have someone help because you'll need to gently stretch your baby's leg straight to do this. Your number probably won't be exactly the same as the doctor's, but you'll get a ballpark figure.Measure the circumference of your baby's head. Wrap a flexible measuring tape around his head just above his eyebrows and ears, and around the back where his head slopes up prominently from his neck. The goal is to measure his head at the spot where it has the largest circumference.Once you have these measurements, plug them into our growth percentile calculator to find out roughly how your baby compares with other babies the same age.

Dietary fats in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_dietary-fats-in-your-pregnancy-diet_1694.bc,"The value of fats in your pregnancy dietFats are an essential part of a healthy diet, but some fats are better for you than others. Your goal (whether or not you're pregnant) is to make sure you get adequate ""good"" fats in your diet while minimizing the ""bad"" fats.Some fats (and the fatty acids they contain) are especially important during pregnancy because they support your baby's brain and eye development  both before and after birth. Fats also help the placenta and other tissues grow, and studies show that some fats may help prevent preterm birth and low birth weight.Which fats to eat during pregnancyThere are four kinds of fat in food: monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, saturated, and trans fat. Each type of fat is made up of a combination of fatty acids, so fats don't typically fall into just one of these categories. Palm oil and lard, for example, are roughly half monounsaturated and half saturated fat, with a bit of polyunsaturated fat as well. But for the most part, you can follow these guidelines for which fats to avoid and which to eat in moderation:Monounsaturated fats are found in olive, canola, and peanut oils, as well as in olives, avocados, nuts, and nut butters. They're considered ""good"" fats because they're best at lowering cholesterol.Polyunsaturated fats are beneficial too. They contain omega-3 fatty acids, like DHA and ALA (both of which are crucial for your baby's healthy development), and omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3s are found in some cold-water fish, flax seed oil, walnuts, and canola oil, and omega-6s are found in sunflower, cottonseed, corn, and soybean oils. (Soybean oil, found in many salad dressings and processed foods, also contains some omega-3s.)Pregnancy weight gain trackerSee your target weight range for pregnancy and whether your weight gain is on track.Fish can be an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, and pregnant women are encouraged to eat 8 to 12 ounces of seafood per week. But some types of fish contain contaminants such as mercury. Choose seafood high in DHA and low in mercury, such as salmon, anchovies, sardines, and herring.Learn more about which fish are safest to eat during pregnancy.Many monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats contain vitamin E, an important antioxidant often missing in the typical American diet.Saturated fats fall into the category of ""bad"" fats. Eat as little of these as possible, and limit them to less than 10 percent of your total calories. Saturated fats are found in high-fat meats, whole and 2 percent milk, tropical oils (such as palm kernel and coconut), butter, and lard. Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperature, unlike unsaturated fats.Trans fats (also known as hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated fats) are to be avoided as much as possible. These fats, which also are typically solid at room temperature, are found in fried foods and some kinds of margarine. They're also used in some packaged foods  like crackers, cookies, and chips  to extend the shelf life of these products. Read the nutrition facts label to find the amount of saturated and trans fat in a product, but keep in mind that trans fat is only listed if there's more than 0.5 grams.A diet high in saturated fat or trans fat can raise your cholesterol and may put you at risk for heart disease. Studies show that saturated and hydrogenated fats may also be linked to other health problems, such as cancer and diabetes.Don't beat yourself up if you indulge in some fried chicken or a bag of chips on occasion. Just try to replace unhealthy fats with healthy fats as often as possible. How much fat to eat during pregnancyThere's probably no need to increase your fat consumption during pregnancy, but finding the right balance is important  aim to get most of the fats in your diet from plant sources.According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), less than 10 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Here's how to figure out the upper limit for the number of grams of saturated fat you should consume in a day, based on your current calorie intake: Divide the number of calories you eat in a day by 10, then divide that number by nine. (There are nine calories in 1 gram of fat.)To see how your physical activity level and pre-pregnancy weight affect the amount of fats you need, use the USDA's SuperTracker tool to get a personalized daily meal plan. The meal plan will include food group recommendations that feature the appropriate amount of fats for you during your pregnancy.Good fat choices during pregnancyMonounsaturated fatsEach of the following contains 5 grams of fat and 45 calories:2 tablespoons (1 ounce) avocado1 teaspoon safflower, olive, canola, or peanut oilsix almonds or cashews10 peanutsfour pecan halves1 1/2 teaspoons nut butters (trans fat free): almond, peanut, cashewtwo Brazil nutsfive hazelnuts (filberts)three macadamia nutseight large black olives10 large green olives with pimento16 pistachiosPolyunsaturated fatsEach of the following contains 5 grams of fat and 45 calories:1 teaspoon margarine, trans fat free1 teaspoon regular mayonnaise1 tablespoon reduced-fat mayonnaisefour walnut halves (omega-3)1 tablespoon flax seed (omega-3)1 teaspoon flax oil (omega-3)1 teaspoon sunflower, corn oil, or soybean oil (omega-6)1 tablespoon regular salad dressing2 tablespoons reduced-fat salad dressing1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds (omega-3), sesame seeds, or sunflower seeds1 tablespoon pine nuts2 teaspoons tahiniMany foods are now fortified with omega-3s. Check the labels on eggs, milk, soy beverages, orange juice, yogurt, bread, cereal, and margarine. Fats to avoid during pregnancySaturated fatsThough the portions below equal one serving of fat, these are the ones to avoid:one slice bacon (regular or turkey)1 teaspoon butter2 tablespoons shredded coconut1 tablespoon regular cream cheese1 1/2 tablespoons reduced-fat cream cheese1 tablespoon heavy cream1 teaspoon shortening or lard2 tablespoons regular sour cream3 tablespoons reduced-fat sour cream1 teaspoon coconut, palm, or palm kernel oilTrans (hydrogenated) fatsFried foods, such as french fries, donuts, and churrosMargarine that has the word ""hydrogenated"" on the ingredient listPeanut butter made with hydrogenated oilCookies, cakes, crackers, pies, turnovers, and candy made with hydrogenated vegetable oilsEasy ways to reduce harmful fats in your pregnancy dietSwitch oils. If you've been cooking or baking with hydrogenated fats, like stick margarine or shortening, substitute canola or safflower oil. (They have the highest smoke point.) Olive oil and flax seed oil are great for salad dressings.Replace some of the meat in your diet. Try toasted nuts instead of bacon bits in your salad, and eat two or three 4-ounce servings of fish instead of meat every week.When you do eat meat, choose lean cuts and avoid ones with marbling. Because leaner cuts of meat are sometimes not as moist, use marinades and slow cooking methods to enhance their texture.Skim the fat off the top of soups and stews before serving.Cut your cheese consumption. Don't order that double cheese pizza, and put half as much cheese in homemade casseroles or similar dishes. You can usually use less cheese if you choose one with a stronger flavor (sharp cheddar instead of mild, for example). Use mashed avocado on your burger in place of cheese.When eating at a fast food restaurant, avoid fried food and choose a smaller grilled burger or grilled chicken sandwich. Have a fruit salad or side salad instead of fries.Replace fat-laden snacks with healthier options, like fruits and vegetables and whole grains.Replace 2 percent and full-fat dairy products with low-fat or nonfat versions.Remove skin from poultry before cooking.Keep an eye out for fats on restaurant menus. Tip-off words: pan-fried, crispy, creamy, creamed, fried, au gratin, hollandaise, escalloped, and buttery. Ask for grilled, baked, or steamed fish, meat, and vegetables instead.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015. Nutrition during pregnancy.

The more you know about how to get started and the benefits of nursing, the better.Choose a doctor for your babyGet names of pediatricians or family practitioners from friends, co-workers, neighbors, or your prenatal caregiver.

See all pregnancy videosAssemble your baby gearThis is the perfect job for your partner or a friend who wants to help. Cribs, bassinets, and strollers can be tricky to put together, especially when you're sleep-deprived, so get started now. Swings, mobiles, and monitors usually require batteries, so make sure you have enough on hand. To save money  and help the planet  consider getting rechargeable batteries and a battery charger.Set up a safe place for your baby to sleepWhether you plan to have your baby slumber in a crib or bassinet, it's important to follow basic guidelines to reduce your baby's risk of SIDS.Find out all about making sure your baby's sleeping space is safe.Talk to your babyYour baby can hear your voice now, and talking to him or her is a great way to start the bonding process. If having an actual conversation with your bump seems odd, try narrating your daily activities; reading a book, magazine, or newspaper aloud; or sharing your secret wishes for your child.This is great practice for after your baby's born, too. Talking to babies is one of the best ways to help them develop language skills.Learn about coping with labor painThere's no one right way to deliver a baby: Every woman's experience with pain is different and every labor is different. But whether you know you want pain medication during childbirth or a natural birth, it's good to learn about your options now.Know the stages of laborFor first-time moms, labor takes an average of 15 hours, though it's not uncommon to last more than 20. (For women who've previously had a vaginal birth, it averages eight hours.) The process is divided into three main stages  learn about them so you'll feel prepared for labor and birth.Create a birth planChildbirth is unpredictable, and chances are you won't follow your birth plan to the letter. Still, it's helpful to figure out your preferences beforehand for pain management techniques, who'll be present during delivery, whether your baby will ""room in"" with you after birth, and more.Fill out our handy Birth Plan Worksheet and discuss it with your provider.Wash your baby's clothing and beddingYou know all those adorable, pristine outfits and blankies you bought or received as gifts? It's time to throw them in the laundry. You should wash anything that will go near your baby's skin to remove any irritants in the fabrics. The gentlest detergents are those designed for babies and those that are labeled hypoallergenic or good for sensitive skin.Start lining up helpersYour friends and family will want to pitch in after your baby's born, but many new moms are too overwhelmed to direct household help. Here's how to prepare now: Make a list of people who have offered to help. Then set up a schedule so each person has a specific task and date to do it.Tasks could include bringing your family a meal, picking up groceries (create a master list of foods your family likes), taking care of your older children, doing the dishes, cleaning up, taking out the garbage, walking your dog, or feeding your pets.Commemorate your bellyCelebrate your amazing pregnant belly by decorating it with beautiful designs (you can use regular face paint), getting a henna ""tattoo"" applied (go to an artist who uses the pure, natural kind), or making a belly cast. You may also want to splurge on professional pictures of your pregnant self.Consider top baby costs and how to saveRaising a baby isn't cheap. (You can check our Baby Costs Calculator to see how it all adds up.) But there are plenty of ways you can think about saving money now.See the top baby expenses moms reported to us, and what you can do about them.Read up on baby careIf you haven't already, the third trimester is the perfect time to switch reading gears from pregnancy to baby. You won't have as much time to read after your baby's born, so learn all you can about the first few weeks now. A good place to start is BabyCenter's newborn area.Pack your bag for the hospital or birth centerKey things to bring include your insurance card, toiletries, comfy clothing, a going-home outfit for your baby, phone (plus charger!), and snacks for after labor. You may also want to bring a box of chocolates or other treat for the nurses (not required, but appreciated!).See our full list of what to pack for the hospital or birth center.Have your house cleanedIn a BabyCenter survey, a third of moms said they wished they had had their house cleaned before their baby's arrival. Consider hiring a housecleaner or asking a friend or family member to tackle this task, maybe while you're at the hospital or birth center. It feels great to come back to a tidy home, and you won't have time or energy to clean while your baby's a newborn.Stock up on household and personal suppliesTo avoid having to make trips to the store with your newborn, stock up now on pantry staples, frozen food, medicine, toilet paper, sanitary pads for postpartum bleeding, shampoo  even extra pairs of underwear! And of course, make sure you have newborn necessities like diapers, wipes, baby clothing, and bottles and formula if you plan to use these.Make food for after your baby's bornWhen you cook, start doubling recipes and freezing half. You and your partner will be too exhausted to cook in the first weeks after you bring your baby home and you'll be thrilled to have healthy meals you can heat up fast. For ideas, check out these recipes good for freezing and reheating.Install your baby's car seatYou can't drive your baby home without a car seat, and they can be more complicated to install than you'd think. So don't wait until the last minute. If you're having trouble, some car seat manufacturers have a toll-free number for you to call so an expert can walk you through the process. Or get a car seat safety inspector to help you. To find one in your area, go to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website or look in your local phone book.Tour your hospital or birth centerThe more familiar you are with your surroundings, the less intimidating labor and birth will be. On your tour of your hospital or birth center, you'll probably visit labor and recovery rooms and the nursery, as well as get an overview of basic policies.Ask if you can preregister in the weeks before your delivery to get this red tape out of the way. You don't want to have to sign a bunch of releases and permissions forms when you're in labor, or have your partner whisked away to do so.Make a plan for when labor startsLong before the first contractions hit, you'll want a firm plan in place. Your doctor or midwife should give you a clear set of guidelines for when to call and  unless you're having a home birth  when to head to the hospital or birth center.Decide who will take you there, and have a few back-up folks lined up to help if you need it. Practice the route you'll take  this may sound silly, but it will be one less thing to think about. This includes learning where to park and which entrance to use when it's time to check yourself in.Learn the signs that your labor may start soon.Make a baby watch listFigure out who you'll want to tell right after your baby arrives (or when you go into labor) and how you'll spread the word. Some new or soon-to-be moms post updates on their social media accounts, while others prefer to call, text, or email the big news. If you'd rather your partner or a friend handle this for you, make a list of phone numbers or email addresses of people you want told right away and pass it on.Look out for late-pregnancy complicationsUnfortunately, pregnancy complications pop up in the third trimester, too  including premature labor and preeclampsia. Be on the lookout for symptoms that warrant a call to your doctor or midwife.Find baby name inspirationIf you don't have a few great baby names on deck, check out our Baby Names Finder to see name popularity, origin, and meanings.Get creative about third-trimester sexIf you're having a healthy, uncomplicated pregnancy, you can probably continue to have sex right up until your water breaks or you go into labor. You may have to get creative about positions as your belly expands, however!Find out more about having sex in the third trimester.Cope with late-pregnancy jittersBy late pregnancy, there are a lot of unknowns that may be making you nervous  like when your labor will start, how it will go, whether your baby will be okay, and how you'll adjust to being a mom. These fears are normal  but nerve-wracking. Here are a few ways to quiet them:Use the relaxation techniques you learned in childbirth classes. They may help calm your nerves now, plus it's good practice for the big day.Visualize your baby and imagine yourself snuggling with him or her.Check in with other moms-to-be in your Birth Club who are also playing the waiting game.Don't be shy about contacting your midwife or doctor if you have any new or lingering concerns.Slow downToward the end of your pregnancy, slow down and save up your energy for labor day (and beyond). If you've been sitting or lying down for a long time, don't jump up too quickly. Blood can pool in your feet and legs, causing a temporary drop in your blood pressure when you get up that can make you feel dizzy.Learn what your body will be like after birthMany first-time moms don't realize that after giving birth, it's normal to still look pregnant for a while. This may be hard to accept, but try to remember that it took nine months to get here, so you won't bounce back overnight. Learn what to expect from your body.Stock up on light entertainmentPick up some magazines or funny novels, fill up your DVR with your favorite programs, and create a list of online shows that you'd like to watch. Once your baby arrives, you'll be glad to have easy, quick ways to get an entertainment fix when you have the chance.Don't panic if you go past your due dateAfter months of anticipation, your due date rolls around, and ... you're still pregnant. It's a frustrating, but common, situation. (In a BabyCenter poll, 33 percent of moms said they delivered late.) If you go one or two weeks past your due date, your provider may use medication or other techniques to start your labor.To-do's for every trimesterDrink waterDuring pregnancy you need about 10 8-ounce glasses of fluid per day (80 fluid ounces) plus an additional 8 ounces for each hour of light activity. Every woman is different, so don't worry if you end up needing a little more or less. Keep an eye on the color of your urine  if it's dark yellow or cloudy, you need to drink more. Clear or pale yellow urine means you're well-hydrated.Find out why staying hydrated is so important.Do some stretchingStretching enhances your flexibility, prevents your muscles from tightening, and makes you feel looser and more relaxed.Check out these soothing pregnancy stretches.Sneak in a pregnancy power napWhen fatigue makes it hard to get through the day, revive yourself with a 15-minute snooze.

Food poisoning in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_food-poisoning-in-babies_1201239.bc,"How can I tell whether my baby has food poisoning?Food poisoning, which is usually caused by eating food or drinking water that's contaminated with one of several kinds of nasty bacteria, can be hard to distinguish from a stomach virus, which is usually picked up on the hands and transferred to the mouth. The symptoms are often the same: vomiting, diarrhea, excessive fussiness, and often fever.If your baby has food poisoning, the symptoms will likely appear two to 48 hours after he eats the food and will usually last a day or two but can continue in severe cases for a week or more.How can I tell what kind of food poisoning my baby has?Testing of blood, stool, and leftover food may identify the bacteria when necessary, but often the doctor won't need to identify the exact culprit because the treatment is the same regardless. (In fact, the treatment is the same for a stomach virus, too.) There are exceptions, though. If there's blood in your baby's stool, for example, the doctor will test to make sure that your baby doesn't have food poisoning that's caused by a potentially dangerous bacteria, like E. coli 0157:H7, Shigella, or Salmonella.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most common food-borne infections are those caused by the bacteria Campylobacter, Salmonella, and E. coli 0157:H7, as well as by a group of viruses called noroviruses. Botulism isn't very common, but it's more prevalent  and more dangerous  among babies. Here's a quick look at these bacteria:Campylobacter is the most frequently diagnosed food-borne bacterium. It's usually transmitted through raw or undercooked poultry or unpasteurized milk, but your baby can also get it from contaminated water. It's not usually spread from person to person, but it can be. (If your baby has it and has diarrhea, for example, you could possibly get it from changing his diaper.)It's also possible to contract the bacteria from the stool of a dog or cat. Campylobacter often goes undiagnosed because there are sometimes no symptoms, but signs can include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), cramping, abdominal pain, and fever. It usually lasts for two to five days, but can linger for up to ten days.Salmonella can be present in raw or undercooked eggs, poultry and meat, raw milk and dairy products, and seafood, and can be spread by food handlers. Reptiles like pet iguanas, turtles, lizards, and snakes can also carry Salmonella. In most cases, if your baby is exposed to Salmonella, he'll develop fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. He may also have tiny pink spots on his skin.Symptoms usually start eight to 48 hours after contact and last for a day or two, though they can persist for more than a week, and the bacteria can continue to exist in the body for months. Two-thirds of patients with Salmonella are under 20 years old. In a very young baby or a person with a compromised immune system, Salmonella can invade the bloodstream and become life threatening.E. coli is transmitted through food or water that's contaminated with microscopic amounts of cow feces. (If a person has E. coli and does not wash her hands after using the toilet, she can also spread it to another person.) E. coli can cause severe, sometimes bloody diarrhea and painful abdominal cramps, without much of a fever.There are a number of strains of Escherichia coli. E. coli 0157:H7 is a particular strain that causes a more severe, longer-lasting illness. In babies and young children, E. coli 0157:H7 can be life threatening and often requires hospitalization. Symptoms can begin eight to 48 hours after your baby eats a food contaminated with the bacteria and last about two to five days.Norovirus is also called Norwalk-like virus (NLVs) or calicivirus, because it belongs to the Caliciviridae virus family. This very common virus isn't often diagnosed because a lab test for it isn't widely available. Severe vomiting is the hallmark sign, and it usually begins suddenly, about 24 to 48 hours after contact with the virus, although symptoms can show up as early as 12 hours.The norovirus is transmitted through contaminated food, utensils, and surfaces. Because it's highly contagious, it spreads easily in daycare facilities and homes. There are many strains of norovirus, so it's hard to develop immunity to them. A case of norovirus usually goes away on its own in one to two days, but in the meantime you'll want to make sure that your baby doesn't get dehydrated because of the vomiting.Botulism is fairly rare  there are only about 110 cases in the United States each year  but it's a particularly worrisome form of food-borne illness because it can be life threatening for a baby. It's caused by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum, which is found in soil. But it's most often transmitted through improperly canned or preserved food, especially home-canned vegetables, cured pork and ham, smoked or raw fish, honey, and corn syrup.Infant botulism happens when a baby eats the bacteria or its spores, and they then grow in his intestinal tract. (This is why you should never feed honey to a baby before his first birthday.) Symptoms in infants include constipation, weakness (loss of muscle tone, weak cry, and weak sucking), droopy eyelids, and poor feeding due to difficulty swallowing. (The baby will be alert, though, despite his weakness.) Left untreated, botulism can progress to muscle and respiratory paralysis. The symptoms usually show up in eight to 36 hours.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.When should I call the doctor?You'll want to let your baby's doctor know what's going on as soon as you suspect your baby might have food poisoning. She can decide if your baby's symptoms warrant an office visit. Tell the doctor about any of the following signs:a fever higher than 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit if your baby's 2 months or younger; 101 degrees F if he's 3 to 6 months; 103 degrees F if he's over 6 monthsvomiting for more than three daysexcessive fussiness (which may signal abdominal pain)blood in his stoola swollen, hard bellyAlso be alert to any of the classic signs of dehydration, including a lack of tears, going more than six hours without a wet diaper, dark yellow urine, lethargy, and a parched mouth. If this happens, your baby's doctor might want to admit him to the hospital (or just keep him there for a few hours) for IV rehydration. Don't be alarmed. Odds are, your baby will be released and back to his healthy self within a few days' time.If you're concerned that your baby may have food poisoning and your doctor isn't available, speak to the doctor on call or take your baby to the emergency room.If your baby is having trouble breathing or swallowing, or shows any signs of severe dehydration  like lethargy, sunken eyes, or cold, splotchy hands and feet  call 911.What can I do to ease my baby's symptoms?You'll want to continue feeding as usual, if your baby will take the breast or bottle. The doctor may also recommend offering small sips of an over-the-counter oral electrolyte solution, such as Pedialyte or Equalyte, to replace the fluids and electrolytes (salt and minerals) that your baby's body is losing. (Avoid juices and sodas, though, because these may make his symptoms worse.) Your doctor can tell you how much your baby needs to be drinking based on his age and weight.If your child has a fever, ask your doctor about giving him the proper dose of infant's acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Never give your baby aspirin as it makes him more susceptible to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease.When can my baby go back to eating normally?If your baby's on solids, once his vomiting and diarrhea lessens or stops and his appetite returns, your doctor will likely recommend that you stop giving him the electrolyte solution as you slowly reintroduce other fluids as well as healthful food. Follow your child's cues  he'll let you know when he feels hungry.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children recovering from stomach troubles resume a normal diet as soon as possible  one that includes such staples as complex carbohydrates (like bread, cereal, and rice), lean meat, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables. (Stay away from fatty food.)Note that this recommendation is different from the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) that doctors used to prescribe. ""The BRAT diet used to be very commonly advocated, but we no longer recommend it because it lacks certain vital nutrients, such as protein,"" says William John Cochran, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Geisinger Clinic in Danville, Pennsylvania.Studies show that reintroducing a standard diet soon after acute symptoms ease can actually shorten the duration of a child's illness by half a day because it restores essential nutrients to his system necessary to fight infection. On the other hand, if your baby misses a few days' worth of good nutrition because his illness just kills his appetite, don't worry. Just make sure you keep him hydrated.How can I help protect my baby from contracting food-borne illness again?The truth is, it's impossible to protect your child from all food-borne bacteria. But you can certainly help reduce his odds of exposure by using proper food preparation practices at home. Try these:Always wash your hands with warm water and soap before preparing food or after going to the bathroom or changing a diaper. Make sure you wash your baby's hands often as well.Rinse meat, poultry, and fish thoroughly before cooking it, and wash all kitchen surfaces well afterward with hot, sudsy water.Never put cooked food, like a steak, back on a plate or cutting board that held uncooked food.Defrost food in the refrigerator, not on the counter top or in the sink. Don't eat meat, poultry, or fish that has been refrigerated uncooked for more than one or two days.Don't use food that looks or smells unusual.Don't use outdated food, packaged food that has a broken seal, or cans that are dented or misshapen.Don't leave food outside the refrigerator for more than an hour before eating or drinking it.Make sure food is cooked well. Use a meat thermometer: Beef should be at least 160 degrees F, poultry at least 180 degrees F, and fish at least 140 degrees F.When reheating food, be sure to do so thoroughly. (Don't just warm it.)Keep hot food hot and cold food cold before eating it.Don't give your child unpasteurized juice or cheese.Buy all meat and fish from reputable stores.If you can your own produce, follow canning instructions carefully.When traveling out of the country, eat hot, freshly cooked food  not raw vegetables or unpeeled fruit  and drink only water that's been boiled.Don't give honey or corn syrup (Karo syrup) to a baby under age 1, because this can put him at risk for botulism.If your baby is bottle-fed, follow all directions for safely preparing his formula and his bottle."
Food poisoning in toddlers,https://www.babycenter.com/0_food-poisoning-in-toddlers_1201243.bc,"How can I tell whether my toddler has food poisoning?Food poisoning, which is usually caused by eating food or drinking water that's contaminated with one of several kinds of nasty bacteria, can be hard to distinguish from a stomach virus, which is usually picked up on the hands and transferred to the mouth. The symptoms are the same: abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and often fever, chills, achiness, and headache.If your toddler has food poisoning, the symptoms will likely appear two to 48 hours after eating the food and will usually last a day or two but can continue in severe cases for a week or more.How can I tell what kind of food poisoning my child has?Testing of blood, stool, and leftover food may identify the bacteria when necessary, but often the doctor won't need to identify the exact culprit because the treatment is the same regardless. (In fact, the treatment is the same for a stomach virus, too.) There are exceptions, though. If there's blood in your toddler's stool, for example, the doctor will test to make sure that he doesn't have food poisoning that's caused by a potentially dangerous bacteria, like E. coli 0157:H7, Shigella, or Salmonella.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most common food-borne infections are those caused by the bacteria Campylobacter, Salmonella, and E. coli 0157:H7, as well as by a group of viruses called noroviruses. Less common  but dangerous if left untreated  is botulism. Here's a quick look at these bacteria:Campylobacter is the most frequently diagnosed food-borne bacterium. It's usually transmitted through raw or undercooked poultry or unpasteurized milk, but your toddler can also get it from contaminated water. It's not usually spread from person to person, but it can be. (If your child has it and has diarrhea, for example, you could possibly get it from cleaning him up.)It's also possible to contract the bacteria from the stool of a dog or cat. Campylobacter often goes undiagnosed because there are sometimes no symptoms, but signs can include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), cramping, abdominal pain, and fever. It usually lasts for two to five days, but can linger for up to ten days.Salmonella can be present in raw or undercooked eggs, poultry and meat, raw milk and dairy products, and seafood, and can be spread by food handlers. Reptiles like pet iguanas, turtles, lizards, and snakes can also carry Salmonella. In most cases, if your child has a bout of Salmonella, he'll develop fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. He may also have tiny pink spots on his skin.Symptoms usually start eight to 48 hours after contact and last for a day or two, though they can persist for more than a week, and the bacteria can continue to exist in the body for months. Two-thirds of patients with Salmonella are under 20 years old. In a person with a compromised immune system, Salmonella can invade the bloodstream and become life threatening.E. coli is transmitted through food or water that's contaminated with microscopic amounts of cow feces. (If a person has E. coli and does not wash her hands after using the toilet, she can also spread it to another person.) E. coli can cause severe, sometimes bloody diarrhea and painful abdominal cramps, without much of a fever.There are a number of strains of Escherichia coli. E. coli 0157:H7 is a particular strain that causes a more severe, longer-lasting illness. In babies and young children, E. coli 0157:H7 can be life threatening and often requires hospitalization. Symptoms can begin eight to 48 hours after your child eats a food contaminated with the bacteria and last about two to five days.Norovirus is also called Norwalk-like virus (NLVs) or calicivirus, because it belongs to the Caliciviridae virus family. This very common virus isn't often diagnosed because a lab test for it isn't widely available. Severe vomiting is the hallmark sign, and it usually begins suddenly, about 24 to 48 hours after contact with the virus, although symptoms can show up as early as 12 hours.The norovirus is transmitted through contaminated food, utensils, and surfaces. Because it's highly contagious, it spreads easily in daycare facilities and homes. There are many strains of norovirus, so it's hard to develop immunity to them. A case of norovirus usually goes away on its own in one to two days, but in the meantime you'll want to make sure that your toddler doesn't get dehydrated because of the vomiting.Botulism is fairly rare  there are only about 110 cases in the United States each year. It's caused by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum, which is found in soil. But it's most often transmitted through improperly canned or preserved food, especially home-canned vegetables, cured pork and ham, smoked or raw fish, honey, and corn syrup.Infant botulism happens when a baby eats the bacteria or its spores, and they then grow in his intestinal tract. (This is why you should never feed honey to a baby before his first birthday.) Symptoms of botulism include constipation, weakness, droopy eyelids, and difficulty swallowing. (The child will be alert, though, despite his weakness.) Left untreated, botulism can progress to muscle and respiratory paralysis. The symptoms usually show up in eight to 36 hours.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.When should I call the doctor?You'll want to let the doctor know what's going on as soon as you suspect your toddler might have food poisoning. She can decide if your child's symptoms warrant an office visit. Tell the doctor about any of the following signs:a fever higher than 103 degrees Fahrenheitvomiting for more than three dayssevere headaches or abdominal painblood in the stool or vomita swollen, hard bellyAlso call your doctor if your toddler shows any of the classic signs of dehydration, including decreased urination, excessive sleepiness or fussiness, cool and discolored hands and feet, or extreme thirst. If this happens, your child's doctor might want to admit him to the hospital (or just keep him there for a few hours) for IV rehydration. Don't be alarmed. Odds are, he'll be released and back to his healthy self within a few days' time.If you're concerned that your toddler may have food poisoning and your doctor isn't available, speak to the doctor on call or take your toddler to the emergency room.If your toddler is having trouble breathing or swallowing, or shows any signs of severe dehydration, call 911.What can I do to ease my toddler's symptoms?Assuming your child has a run-of-the-mill case of food poisoning, with vomiting or diarrhea, you'll want to keep him home to rest and replace the lost fluids and electrolytes (salt and minerals) that his body is losing. Usually, doctors recommend giving an over-the-counter oral electrolyte solution, such as Equalyte or Pedialyte (which is also sold as ice pops), by offering small sips frequently throughout the day. Your doctor can tell you how much your child needs to be drinking based on his age and weight. (Avoid juices and sodas, though, because these may make his symptoms worse.)If your child has a fever, you might want to give him the proper dose of acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Never give your child aspirin as it makes him more susceptible to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease.When can my toddler go back to eating normally?Once your toddler's vomiting and diarrhea lessens or stops, and his appetite returns, your doctor will likely recommend that you stop giving him the electrolyte solution as you slowly reintroduce other fluids, including milk, as well as healthful food. Follow your child's cues  he'll let you know when he feels hungry.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children recovering from stomach troubles resume a normal diet as soon as possible  one that includes such staples as complex carbohydrates (like bread, cereal, and rice), lean meat, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables. Stay away from fatty food.Note that this recommendation is different from the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) that doctors used to prescribe. ""The BRAT diet used to be very commonly advocated, but we no longer recommend it because it lacks certain vital nutrients, such as protein,"" says William John Cochran, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Geisinger Clinic in Danville, Pennsylvania.Studies show that reintroducing a standard diet soon after acute symptoms ease can actually shorten the duration of a child's illness by half a day because it restores essential nutrients to his system necessary to fight infection. On the other hand, if your child misses a few days' worth of good nutrition because his illness just kills his appetite, don't worry. Just make sure you keep him hydrated.How can I help protect my child from contracting food-borne illness again?The truth is, it's impossible to protect your child from all food-borne bacteria. But you can certainly help reduce his odds of exposure by using proper food preparation practices at home. Try these:Always wash your hands with warm water and soap before preparing food or after going to the bathroom or helping your child with the potty or changing a diaper. Make sure you help your child wash his hands often as well.Rinse meat, poultry, and fish thoroughly before cooking it, and wash all kitchen surfaces well afterward with hot, sudsy water.Never put cooked food, like a steak, back on a plate or cutting board that held uncooked food.Defrost food in the refrigerator, not on the countertop or in the sink. Don't eat meat, poultry, or fish that has been refrigerated uncooked for more than one or two days.Don't use food that looks or smells unusual.Don't use outdated food, packaged food that has a broken seal, or cans that are dented or misshapen.Don't leave food outside the refrigerator for more than an hour before eating or drinking it.Make sure food is cooked well. Use a meat thermometer: Beef should be at least 160 degrees F, poultry at least 180 degrees F, and fish at least 140 degrees F.When reheating food, be sure to do so thoroughly. (Don't just warm it.)Keep hot food hot and cold food cold before eating it.Don't give your child unpasteurized milk, juice, or cheese, or raw meat.If you can your own produce, follow canning instructions carefully.Buy all meat and fish from reputable stores.When traveling out of the country, eat hot, freshly cooked food  not raw vegetables or unpeeled fruit  and drink only water that's been boiled."
Holiday foods to avoid during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_holiday-foods-to-avoid-during-pregnancy_1408439.bc,"Even if you've always had an iron stomach, pregnancy weakens your immune system and makes you more vulnerable to food-borne illnesses that could make you sick and harm your baby. So it's important to learn which foods to avoid during pregnancy  even on special occasions.""The risks are real and need to be taken very seriously,"" says Linda Katz, chief medical officer of the Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).Dangerous bacteria and parasites like listeria, toxoplasma, salmonella, staphylococcus aureus, and E. coli can lurk in improperly prepared, cooked, and stored foods. Andlisteriaandtoxoplasmacan cross your placenta and affect your baby even if you never feel symptoms of the illness yourself.You may have always licked cookie dough off a spoon, enjoyed Caesar salads with raw egg in the dressing, or ordered your burgers medium rare, but pregnancy is a time to err on the side of food safety, experts say.Here are some tips to get you through summer barbecues, holiday buffets, and other festive occasions without feeling deprived  or getting sick.Valentine's DayChocolates:If your valentine brings you a box of chocolates, feel free to dive right in. But tobe on the safe side, don't eat candies filled with alcoholic liqueurs like Grand Marnier or amaretto.Memorial Day, Fourth of July, and Labor DayPrepared foods:Prepared salads from the deli (especially those containing protein, like egg, chicken, ham, and seafood) can be contaminated with listeria if they aren't prepared and handled properly. This includes homemade and store-bought salads as well as sandwiches made from these salads.Ready-to-eat salads that aren't reheated can pose a risk to pregnant women, so you may want to avoid them altogether. If you do choose to eat them, discard any leftovers within four days after preparation.Also stay away from salads (and other food) left unrefrigerated or unheated. For example, if you arrive at a party and there's a potato salad that's not on ice or meat that isn't on a hot plate, don't eat it unless you know for sure that it's been out for less than two hours (one hour for refrigerated foods if the temperature outside is higher than 90 degrees).Hot dogs and lunch meat:Hot dogs are generally high in nitrates, fat, and sodium. But it's safe to enjoy one now and then, provided it's fresh off the grill or has otherwise been cooked until steaming (165 degrees Fahrenheit) to kill bacteria that may be present. Lunch and deli meats also need to be reheated until they're steaming.Also be careful when handling packages of hot dogs and lunch meat. Don't let the juice from the packaging come in contact with foods that won't be cooked, and wash your hands thoroughly after handling it.Burgers and other grilled meat or fish:If you're offered a burger or other grilled or barbecued meat, chicken, pork, or fish, make sure it's well done and not pink in any areas. Undercooked meat can harbor E. coli, salmonella, and toxoplasma bacteria.Ground beef, veal, lamb, and pork should be cooked to at least 160 degrees F, and all poultry to 165 degrees F. Pork roasts and chops need to reach 145 degrees F, and fish 145 degrees F. Use a food thermometer to test the temperature because the color of the food isn't always a good indication of how well it's done.Note: Because of concerns aboutmercury in fish, the FDA recommends limiting yourself to 12 ounces (about two servings) of fish a week, and avoiding some kinds of fish altogether. For more information, see our article oneating fish during pregnancy.Ice cream:Don't eat homemade ice cream made with raw eggs, which can contain salmonella. (Cooking kills the bacteria but freezing doesn't.)Ice:Use clean ice for your drinks, not the ice that's keeping the meat cold or that others have stuck their hands into. Bacteria can thrive in a cooler full of ice.Raw sprouts:Don't garnish your burger or salad with alfalfa or other raw sprouts. They can contain E. coli or salmonella bacteria. For the same reason, make sure raw vegetables  lettuce and cabbage in particular  have been washed. HalloweenRaw cookie dough or cake batter:If you're making Halloween cookies or cupcakes, resist the temptation to sample the batter. The raw eggs in cookie dough and cake batter could contain salmonella or other bacteria that can make you sick. Stick with store-bought goodies or bake your treats without tasting the uncooked batter.ThanksgivingOn turkey day (as on every other day), it's important to be vigilant againstgerms and bacteria in the kitchen. Wash your hands frequently when preparing meals, and be careful to clean any surface that has come in contact with raw meat or eggs before using it for other foods. Use separate cutting boards for poultry and produce, and keep uncooked poultry and meat chilled in the refrigerator and separate from other food items.Don't leave leftovers out for longer than two hours, and store them in shallow containers so they'll cool quickly. Set your refrigerator between 35 and 40 degrees F and your freezer at or below zero to keep cold foods from going bad.Turkey and stuffing:Cook turkey until it reaches an internal temperature of 180 degrees F. (Use a meat thermometer to check it.) If you're preparing stuffing (also known as dressing), cook it in a separate baking dish to 165 degrees F. The inside of a stuffed turkey doesn't get hot enough to kill harmful bacteria.Unpasteurized cider and juice:Make sure apple cider (whether hot or cold) is pasteurized before you drink it. Unpasteurized juices, including cider, are unsafe to drink during pregnancy because they can contain bacteria, including E. coli. Almost all juice sold is pasteurized, and unpasteurized juice sold in containers must be labeled as such.Note: Year round, you'll want to avoid juice served at juice bars, especially if it's freshly squeezed because there's a good chance it's not pasteurized.Smoked meats and meat spreads:If you're serving meat spreads (like pt), or smoked fish (such as smoked salmon or trout), make sure they're canned, not from the refrigerated section of the grocery store. Refrigerated meat spreads and smoked meats, fish, and shellfish can contain listeria, so it's only safe to eat them if they're heated until steaming or part of a dish that has been cooked.Winter holidaysUnpasteurized soft cheeses:Stay away from soft cheeses made with unpasteurized milk.Unpasteurized or ""raw milk"" cheesesmay contain listeria, which is killed during the pasteurization process.The FDA recommends checking the label of any soft cheese to make sure it says ""made with pasteurized milk."" If you can't check the label  if you're at a party, for example  avoid blue cheese and soft cheeses (including Brie, Camembert, goat cheese, feta, and Roquefort) and Mexican-style cheeses (like queso fresco, queso blanco, and panela).If you're not sure which cheeses are safe, stick with hard cheeses, like cheddar and Swiss, and semi-soft cheeses, like Monterey jack and mozzarella. Cream cheese and pasteurized processed cheeses like American are also safe.Sushi:Avoid sushi trays withraw fish, which may contain parasites and bacteria. If you're a sushi fan, opt instead for a California roll made with avocado and cooked crab. Although raw fish poses little direct risk to your baby, if you get ill from sushi you'll probably suffer from vomiting and dehydration, which can affect your unborn baby.Carving stations:Make sure the meat is cooked well-done and is still steaming hot. Unless you're sure they're well cooked, avoid sauces like barnaise, hollandaise, and aioli, which can contain uncooked eggs.Eggnog:Homemadeeggnogis generally off-limits because it's usually made with raw, unpasteurized eggs  andalcohol. But you can make a virgin, pregnancy-safe version at home with pasteurized eggs, a pasteurized egg product, or an egg alternative. Or try store-bought eggnog (just check the label to make sure the eggs are pasteurized).You might also consider ""soy nog,"" which doesn't contain eggs or any other dairy products. You can find it during the winter holidays in most large grocery stores and in natural food stores.You'll also want to avoid desserts that may contain raw or undercooked eggs, like some custards, mousse, and homemade ice cream.Fruitcake and other alcoholic food items:Fruitcake and other desserts that use alcohol as an ingredient are generally okay, because most of the alcohol burns off during cooking. If the fruitcake has been soaked in rum or other liquor after being baked, however, little of the alcohol will have evaporated and you should probably not eat it.New Year's EveRaw oysters and other shellfish:Stay away from uncooked shellfish, including oysters, clams, mussels, and scallops. Cook shellfish until the shell opens to ensure that any bacteria or parasites have been killed. Discard any shellfish that doesn't open during cooking because this means that the shellfish was dead before cooking and may have been sick.Champagne and other alcoholic beverages:It's best to avoid alcohol altogether when you're pregnant. Even one glass of wine or one beer can affect your baby's growth, according to a 2015 report from the American Academy of Pediatrics. Consider celebrating instead with a glass of sparkling apple or grape cider or soda, or try a festive non-alcoholic cocktail.More safe-eating tipsWash your handsafter touching raw meat, raw eggs, or unwashed vegetables, before and after preparing food, and before eating or drinking.Check out the FDA'sprintable brochure on food safety for mothers-to-be.TheMarch of Dimes websiteincludes information on food safety for expectant moms.11 foods to avoid during pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:23Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:23Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Sickle cell anemia,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sickle-cell-anemia_1422335.bc,"What is sickle cell anemia?Sickle cell anemia is an inherited blood disorder that causes red blood cells, which are normally round and flexible, to become stiff and crescent shaped. As a result, these blood cells are unable to travel through the blood vessels to deliver oxygen to the body. They become stuck, causing pain and organ damage and increasing susceptibility to infection.In addition, sickled cells live for only about ten to 20 days, rather than 120 days as normal red blood cells do. Because the body has trouble replacing these cells fast enough, a shortage of red blood cells, or anemia, may result.How does a child get sickle cell anemia?Sickle cell diseases are inherited from both parents. A baby inherits two genes for hemoglobin, one from the mother and one from the father. If a baby inherits genes for hemoglobin S from both parents, he'll have sickle cell anemia, also known as hemoglobin SS disease.A baby who inherits one hemoglobin S gene and one normal hemoglobin A gene won't have sickle cell anemia, but he will be a carrier  which means that he could pass the trait to his children. This condition is called sickle cell trait.Some children inherit one hemoglobin S gene and one for another type of abnormal hemoglobin. This results in a different form of sickle cell disease, such as S-beta thalassemia or hemoglobin SC disease.Sickle cell anemia affects 72,000 people in the United States, most of them of African ancestry. In fact, 1 of every 500 African Americans is born with the disease. Sickle cell anemia also affects 1 in 900 Hispanic Americans. About 1 in 12 African Americans and 1 in 16 Hispanic Americans carry the trait for sickle cell.Scientists think the sickle cell gene may have developed in tropical Africa because carrying the trait also protects against malaria, a disease caused by a parasite that lives in red blood cells which has afflicted people there since ancient times.Can carriers get the disease?A carrier is someone who has one sickle cell gene and one normal gene. This person doesn't have the disease, so he usually doesn't become anemic or experience painful episodes.A carrier does face certain health risks under extreme conditions, however. Physical exertion at high altitudes, for example, could put a sickle cell carrier at risk for dehydration, heat stroke, or blood in the urine.If your baby inherits one hemoglobin S gene and one hemoglobin A gene, he'll make both kinds of hemoglobin, and the normal hemoglobin will keep his blood flowing smoothly. He has a 50/50 chance of passing the sickle cell gene on to his children.How do doctors diagnose sickle cell anemia?A blood test can provide a complete hemoglobin profile. More than 40 states require screening at birth for sickle cell anemia, along with other routine newborn screening tests. If sickle cell disease is indicated, a second test is given to confirm the diagnosis.The blood test will also determine whether your child is a carrier of the sickle cell trait. If your state doesn't require the test, you can request it. And if your baby wasn't screened at birth, you can still have him tested.What are the symptoms?There are many symptoms and possible complications. In addition to chronic anemia, which can make a baby weak and tired, sickle cell patients often experience:Episodes of pain: Sudden, severe pain in a part of the body where the sickled cells are stuck and blocking oxygen flow to the tissues. This can occur anywhere, including the fingers and toes (hand-foot syndrome) or in the chest and long bones of the body.A pain crisis, or sickle crisis, may require a trip to the hospital, where doctors can help make the child more comfortable. Painful episodes can occur as infrequently as once a year or more than 15 times a year.Problems involving the spleen: Sickled cells can sometimes pool in the spleen, causing a sudden, dangerous drop in hemoglobin and more severe anemia. Because of the increased blood volume, the spleen can become enlarged and painful. This is called splenic sequestration.If splenic sequestration occurs often, the damaged spleen may need to be removed. This happens most often in children who are under 4 years old. A child's body can function without a spleen but will have a harder time fighting off infections.More viral and bacterial infections: A healthy spleen helps protect the body against infection by destroying bacteria in the blood. When sickled cells get caught and damage the spleen, the organ can't perform well. As a result, children with sickled cells are especially vulnerable to infections, especially from streptococcus pneumonia, and they're less able to fight off infections once they occur.These infections can be extremely serious. In fact, a pneumococcal infection can quickly become fatal. So it's important for parents of children with sickle cell disease to be on the alert for signs of infection, including fever and unusual symptoms such as vomiting, rapid breathing, cough, lethargy, or pain.Stroke: A stroke can occur if the sickled cells block a blood vessel in the brain. About 10 percent of children with the disease have strokes, most often between the ages of 4 and 6.A child who has a stroke will typically be treated with red blood cell transfusions to prevent further damage. Indications of a stroke include severe headache, difficulty with speech, loss of vision, dizziness, coma, or a sudden weakness or numbness in the face, arm, or leg (usually on one side).Aplastic crisis: An aplastic crisis happens when an infection (usually human parvovirus B19) causes red blood cell production to stop for about ten days. When this occurs in a healthy person, it usually goes unnoticed because normal red blood cells live for about 120 days. When it happens to somebody with sickle cell disease, however, it causes the red blood count to drop dangerously low because sickled cells live only ten to 20 days.Symptoms of an aplastic crisis include headache, fever, lethargy, paleness, and fainting. Blood transfusions can help raise the child's blood count until his body starts making red blood cells again.Acute chest syndrome: This common complication of sickle cell disease is caused by a respiratory infection or by sickled cells becoming trapped in the lungs. Similar to pneumonia, acute chest syndrome causes difficulty breathing, chest pain, and fever. The condition can quickly become life threatening. In fact, acute chest syndrome is the most common cause of death in patients with sickle cell disease.Eye problems: If the retina, at the back of the eye, doesn't get enough oxygen from the blood, it can deteriorate, even to the point of blindness. Laser treatment is sometimes used to help prevent further vision loss in sickle cell patients with eye damage.Jaundice: The liver filters harmful substances from the blood. When the liver has trouble keeping up with the rapid breakdown of red blood cells, bilirubin (a pigment that results from the breakdown of hemoglobin) builds up. This can cause a yellowing of the skin and eyes.When should I call a doctor?When healthy children feel unwell, home treatments  like giving extra fluids or pain medication  are often appropriate before calling a doctor. In a child with sickle cell disease, however, the risk of a life-threatening infection is so high that you should call the doctor at the first sign of illness.What are my child's treatment options?There's no cure for sickle cell anemia or other forms of sickle cell disease, but doctors can help reduce your baby's pain and help prevent infection.Pain that isn't too severe is sometimes managed with pain relievers like acetaminophen and anti-inflammatory drugs. Severe pain crises may require a stay in the hospital, especially if your baby can't drink fluids because of vomiting or pain.At the hospital, doctors will give your baby fluids through an intravenous (IV) tube, as well as pain medication. Blood transfusions are sometimes used to help prevent strokes, treat anemia, and protect the spleen.Penicillin has been shown to reduce the risk of infection by 85 percent in children with sickle cell anemia, so your child will be given penicillin daily from the time he's about 2 months old until he's at least 5 years old.He'll receive the same routine vaccinations as other children, including a pneumococcal conjugate, or PCV7 (prevnar), shot at 2, 4, 6, and 12 to 15 months to protect against streptococcus pneumonia bacteria. He'll also receive an additional pneumococcal vaccine, PPV23 (pneumovax), to cover related bacteria at 2 and 5 years; the meningococcal vaccine, which can be given after the age of 2 to protect against Neisseria meningitidis, a type of bacteria that can cause serious blood infections or meningitis; and an annual flu shot.The doctor may also suggest folic acid supplements, which can help your baby's bone marrow make new red blood cells.What can I do to keep my baby from falling ill?Keep your baby as healthy as possible by providing well-balanced nutrition, good hygiene, regular visits to his healthcare providers, and plenty of rest.Try to keep your child from getting stressed or dehydrated, and avoid exposing him to extremely cold temperatures, because these conditions have been shown to contribute to sickle cell crises. It's also a good idea to keep your baby away from anyone who's sick.Once your child is about age 2 or older, the doctor may suggest something called transcranial doppler ultrasonography, which creates a picture of the brain that can help determine whether your baby is at high risk for a stroke. (Stroke is not uncommon in children with sickle cell disease.)If your child's chance of having a stroke is high or he has severe sickle cell symptoms, he may be given frequent blood transfusions.One other precaution: If you take an airplane flight with your baby, make sure you're traveling in a pressurized cabin. An unpressurized cabin can trigger a sickle crisis because of the lower concentration of oxygen in the air. (The same risk is involved in a visit to an area that's at a high elevation.)What does the future hold?Over the years, children with sickle cell anemia grow and develop more slowly than other children. As adolescents and adults, they tend to have a slight build and often develop gallstones and kidney and joint problems.Until recently, patients with sickle cell anemia typically died from organ failure or infection between the ages of 20 and 40. Today, with proper treatment, many patients live into their 40s and 50s. Researchers continue to work on possible cures and treatment options for sickle cell anemia.Promising drugs include hydroxyurea, which seems to stimulate the production of fetal hemoglobin. Experts believe that fetal hemoglobin helps prevent the sickling of cells.Most people stop producing fetal hemoglobin shortly after birth, and by 6 months of age, there's typically little fetal hemoglobin remaining. But some sickle cell patients continue to produce large amounts of fetal hemoglobin, and these patients have less severe symptoms than those who don't.Hydroxyurea has been approved for use in adults, but its safety for use in children is still being tested. (The National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute is conducting an ongoing trial of the use of hydroxyurea to prevent organ damage in children.)Other drugs include butyrate, a simple fatty acid that's commonly used as a food additive, which is thought to increase fetal hemoglobin production; vanillin, a flavoring that's thought to bind with affected red blood cells and inhibit sickling; and clotrimazole, an over-the-counter antifungal medication that may reduce sickling by preventing the loss of water from red blood cells.Stem cell transplantation (either from bone marrow or umbilical cord blood) is currently a promising possibility for sickle cell patients.Can sickle cell anemia be detected before birth?Yes. Prenatal testing can detect sickle cell diseases. As early as the first trimester, doctors can take a sample of placental tissue (chorionic villus sampling, or CVS) to detect whether a baby has the genes that would lead to sickle cell anemia or sickle cell trait. After 17 weeks, amniocentesis can be used to test the amniotic fluid.Prenatal test: Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:33Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:33Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Age and fertility: Getting pregnant in your 40s,https://www.babycenter.com/0_age-and-fertility-getting-pregnant-in-your-40s_1494699.bc,"There's no denying your odds of getting pregnant are far lower now than they were just a few years ago. After 45, experts say, it's almost impossible to get pregnant using your own eggs.At the same time, many 40-plus women do get pregnant, some using fertility treatments and some not. And there may be benefits to waiting to have children  for both you and your child.Pregnancy at any age has advantages and disadvantages. We checked in with fertility specialists, financial consultants, relationship gurus, and 40-something moms to get a realistic picture of what it's like to have a child in your 40s.Advantages of waiting to have childrenThere are some definite benefits to becoming a parent when you're older:You're more experienced. Probably the greatest advantage of waiting to have children is that you've had time to grow and to see the world. You're probably more secure financially and more comfortable in your career. It's likely you and your partner have had the chance to get to know each other in a variety of circumstances, which can be a solid foundation for raising a family.You're wiser. There's some evidence that older mothers are, in general, better educated than young mothers and make wiser parenting decisions. They're also more likely to breastfeed and, according to a study published in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association, to make healthier nutritional choices for children, such as choosing whole fruits rather than sweets or sugary drinks.You're more financially secure. Waiting to have children also has financial benefits. One U.S. study found that a woman's earnings increase 9 percent for every year she postpones having a child.What does your OB-GYN want you to know before getting pregnant?

See all videosSusan Heitler, a family and marriage therapist in Denver, Colorado, believes that the best time to have children is in your late 20s to early 30s, but she also sees pluses for couples who wait: ""Parents in their 40s are often more focused on their children than younger parents are,"" she says. ""They've had time to travel and to have a broad range of experiences before having children. They have less financial pressure and more of a 'been there, done that' attitude toward partying and 60-hour work weeks.""Nicole Rogers, a mother of five and sales director at the San Francisco Marriott, says that at 41 she has less energy than she used to, but on the other hand is a wiser and more patient parent.""In your 20s and your 30s, you tend to put too much pressure on yourself as a parent,"" she says. ""You think it will be a disaster if things don't go just right. If you don't have time to buy a present before a birthday party, for example, you stress out about it. As an older parent, I find things don't bother me as much.""On a practical level, ""when you're a single parent in your 20s and you're late for work, it can cost you your job, which means you may not be able to pay the rent,"" she says. ""Now I have job and financial security. I'm a lot more relaxed.""Drawbacks of trying to get pregnant after 40Postponing parenthood can cause serious problems:You may have a hard time getting pregnant. The biggest downside to putting off pregnancy until your 40s is significant: It's harder to get pregnant the longer you wait. That's because your egg supply decreases significantly as you age, and older eggs are more likely to have chromosomal problems, raising the risk of miscarriage and birth defects.""There's a steep drop in fertility in the 40s,"" says Julia Johnson, an infertility specialist and chair of the obstetrics and gynecology department at UMass Memorial Medical Center. ""Your odds of getting pregnant at 41 are much better than they are at 43.""A study in the medical journal Fertility and Sterility confirms Johnson's point. Researchers found that 40-year-old women treated for infertility had a 25 percent chance of getting pregnant using their own eggs. But by age 43 that number dropped to 10 percent, and by 44 it had plummeted to 1.6 percent. Among women who did get pregnant, the miscarriage rate was 24 percent for 40-year-olds, 38 percent for 43-year-olds, and 54 percent for 44-year-olds.Fertility expert James Goldfarb says that during his 30 years in the field, he has never seen a woman get pregnant with her own eggs after age 46. ""It's like buying a lottery ticket,"" he says. ""Yes, someone wins every once in a while, but you shouldn't bank on it.""Using donor eggs boosts the odds of getting pregnant considerably, and according to Goldfarb, that's how most older celebrity moms are doing it  whether they admit it or not. ""The fact that they don't talk about it openly does a real disservice to other women,"" he says. ""We get at least one patient a month who comes in with the false hope that she can get pregnant using her own eggs.""You're more likely to have a difficult pregnancy. Pregnancy complications are another concern. In your 40s you're far more likely to develop problems like high blood pressure and diabetes during pregnancy as well as placental problems and birth complications.You're at higher risk of a small or preterm baby. Women older than 40 are more likely to deliver a low-birth-weight or preterm baby. Stillbirth rates are also higher, and studies show that children born to older mothers may be at increased risk of type 1 diabetes and high blood pressure (though this association isn't strong).Your partner's sperm is older too. Don't forget about your partner: Although men are physically capable of fathering children in their 60s and even their 70s, sperm quality deteriorates with age. Older men's sperm has a higher rate of genetic defects than younger men's sperm. In recent years, studies have suggested links between the father's age and genetically related conditions such as Down syndrome, schizophrenia, and autism spectrum disorder.You could strain your finances. One more thing to keep in mind: There are financial advantages to waiting to have children, but there may be liabilities as well. ""If you wait, you're likely to have to continue working to an older age, for one thing,"" says Marnie Azner, a financial planner in Morris Plains, New Jersey.""You'll still have financial responsibilities at a time when many of your friends are beginning to retire,"" Azner says. ""If you haven't been putting aside money for retirement up until now, it's going to get even harder to do so after you have children. Other things become more expensive too, like life insurance and healthcare. Finally, if you have trouble getting pregnant, the cost of fertility treatments can really add up.""Your chances of getting pregnant in your 40sAlmost half of women over 40 have fertility problems, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.You have about a 5 percent chance of getting pregnant in any single ovulation cycle, according to leading fertility specialist Sherman Silber, director of the Infertility Center of St. Louis at St. Luke's Hospital in Missouri and author of four best-selling fertility books, including How to Get Pregnant.At 40, your chance of conceiving within a year is about 40 to 50 percent, compared with a woman in her mid 30s, who has a 75 percent chance. By age 43, a woman's chance of pregnancy plummets to 1 or 2 percent.Why the steep drop-off? Silber says it's all about the eggs. When you reach puberty, your eggs number between 300,000 and 500,000, and after that you lose about 13,000 eggs a year. Over the years, this steady drop in egg supply leaves you with about 25,000 eggs by age 37  the age that also coincides with a precipitous drop in fertility.""By age 43, you're really at the end of your egg supply,"" Silber says, ""and your chances of pregnancy are slim.""Miscarriage rates begin to skyrocket in your 40s as well. At 40, the rate is 34 percent, and it rises to 53 percent by age 45. Your risk of pregnancy complications, such as high blood pressure and gestational diabetes, increases after 35 and continues to rise in your 40s.The odds of genetic problems also jump as you get older: At 40, your chance of conceiving a child with Down syndrome is one in 100; at 45 it's one in 30. Because the risk of genetic problems increase with age, experts routinely recommend that women in their 40s have detailed fetal screenings such as cell-free fetal DNA blood testing, advanced ultrasound, amniocentesis, or chorionic villus sampling.Prenatal test: Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:33Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:33Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosMothers over 40 also have a nearly 50 percent chance of having a c-section as a result of delivery complications. Incidents of low-birth-weight and stillborn babies are higher as well.One very positive fact on your side: Given the range of new assisted reproductive technologies (ART) methods now available, there's no better time in history to try to get pregnant as an older mother. Although in vitro fertilization (IVF) success rates fall significantly when women use their own eggs after age 35, the chance of success using donor eggs remains high with a pregnancy rate of about 50 percent for women through their late 40s.For women in their 40s who use eggs from a woman in her 20s or 30s, the risk of miscarriage and chromosomal problems is consistent with the age of the egg donor.How to get pregnant after 40To give yourself the best chance for a normal pregnancy and a healthy baby, consider taking a few important steps before trying to conceive. Read these tips to help you prepare for pregnancy.If you're in your early 40s, your healthcare provider will likely refer you to a fertility specialist if you don't get pregnant after having frequent (about two or three times a week) unprotected sex for up to six months.Others advise seeing a specialist right away  especially if there are specific reasons you may have trouble getting pregnant, such as irregular or missed periods, ovulation difficulties, or problems with your partner's sperm.Most specialists start by doing tests to determine if there's a problem with the way your ovaries function. Then they'll check for problems with your fallopian tubes or your partner's sperm.If no such problems are found, then it's likely your infertility is from age and declining egg quality. Your physician will advise you about your options depending on your individual circumstances.For more on age and fertility, read our articles on getting pregnant in your 20s and 30s.

14 ways to save on family food bills,https://www.babycenter.com/0_14-ways-to-save-on-family-food-bills_1497525.bc,"Scouting around in the family budget for quick savings? You may not be able to reduce your mortgage or rent overnight, but you can reduce your food bills quickly and easily with these cost-busting ideas.Seven shopping tricks1. Shop alone  and after eatingOne simple recipe for avoiding impulse buying: Do your shopping after a light snack or meal and leave the kids at home.If you aren't hungry, yummy-looking foods will be easier to pass up. And if your children aren't with you, they won't be clamoring for all the goodies at eye level.With your stomach full and your hands free, you'll find yourself with both the time and energy to do real comparison shopping. So have your partner or another adult stay with the kids while you head to the store, list in hand, ready to scan the aisles for what you need as well as special deals.2. Understand how stores workA basic understanding of merchandising can help you avoid overspending. These simple habits will go a long way toward keeping your budget in check:Walk briskly toward what you came to buy and avoid distractions along the way. For example, have you ever noticed that the diapers and milk are often at the back of the store? You're forced to walk past a lot of temptation to get to the items you need most often.Products are displayed at the ends of the aisles to catch your eye. Think carefully about whether what you see there is really necessary or a bargain before you toss it in the cart. Many ""featured"" items are not bargains at all.As you peruse the aisles, bend over to check the prices on the bottom shelves and compare them with the cost of the items at eye level.Avoid buying the items displayed by the register. The magazines at the checkout stand cost much more per issue than they would if you had a subscription, and cookies in little packages cost more than a from a box. Almost everything near the register is there to inspire you to buy on impulse, not to save you money.Tip: Make fewer trips to the store and you'll find yourself with fewer chances to pick up a few extras you don't really need.3. Buy house brands or genericsThe less costly house brands are often so similar to national brands that you wouldn't be able to tell them apart without the packaging. Read labels to compare nutritional value and you'll quickly see how little difference (if any) there is other than price.Store brands cost an average of 27 percent less than name brands, according to Consumer Reports, which looked at 29 different food categories. Testers said store brands tasted the same or better in all but six categories.Meat and dairy products all have to meet government standards, so store brands should be just as wholesome and nutritious as national brands.Tip: You can donate to your child's school as you shop. This costs you nothing just sign up for the school's scrip or electronic scrip fundraising program. Participating stores then donate part of the value of your purchase to the school every time you shop. To find out more, ask at your child's school.4. Check the unit priceDon't be fooled by packaging. As you cruise down the aisles comparing products, take note of the unit price that appears on the store shelf just below or above the product. The unit price tells you what the product costs per ounce or some other consistent unit of measurement.Whether the package is tall, short, or squat, you'll know in an instant whether it costs more or less than other sizes of the same food. Compare per-unit prices and buy the item that offers more for less instead of the one that looks like more for less.5. Use savings cards and couponsCheck your supermarket's weekly flyer or ads for coupons on items you buy regularly, but also take advantage of your store's savings card.Many supermarkets offer savings-card programs that entitle you to special bargains or cash-back dividends on your purchases. Just present the savings card (or your ID number) at checkout, and depending on how your store's program is structured, you'll get savings on the spot or a dividend at the end of the year.Keep your clipped coupons organized, perhaps separated according to grocery aisle or section. Whether you choose to hold them in envelopes, in a zip-top bag, with paper clips, or in a specially designed accordion file, store them in your purse or car so they're with you whenever you shop. It's annoying to come home from food shopping and find the coupon you wanted on the counter on your store's triple coupon day.Tip: If a sale item doesn't appear on the shelves, ask for a rain check so you can get it for the reduced price when it's back in stock.6. Buy in bulkBuying in bulk is a no-brainer if you're feeding a big family or the whole preschool. But you can still benefit from these discounts if yours is a smaller family or you have limited storage space. Here are some ideas for making the most of oversize buys:As always, arrive at your bulk-shopping store with a list. This will help you avoid buying a TV, watch, barbecue, or package of 200 gel pens just because it's such a good deal.Buy mostly nonperishable items that you know for sure you'll use eventually for example, paper products, cleaning supplies, baby wipes, juice boxes, and canned goods.If you do purchase perishables, separate large packages into smaller ones as soon as you get home. Divide chicken and steaks, for example, into daily portions and freeze for later use.Split the purchases and the bill with another family. Again, a list is a must agree ahead of time on what you'll buy. If you trade off trips to the store, both families also save time.7. Buy from the sourceGet produce from a local farmer's market and you may be able to avoid the store markup on fresh vegetables and fruit, especially if you buy organic. Keep an eye out at the farmer's market for growers selling blemished produce at bargain prices it tastes wonderful but doesn't meet grocery store standards for beauty.Some farmer's markets carry locally produced meat and dairy products, locally caught fish, and a variety of prepared sauces, preserves, and condiments made by local food artisans that would cost much more in stores. Of course, these are expensive no matter where you buy them. But if they're must-haves for your family, a farmer's market may be your best bet. Four planning tricks1. Buy in seasonBlueberries can cost $2 a pint or $6 a pint, depending on whether you buy them in June or January. The price of lettuce, tomatoes, avocadoes, and other fruits and vegetables also varies by season (and sometimes by the weather, as droughts and other extremes shrink crops and raise prices).Plan your menus around what's in season in your area, and you'll avoid paying extra for produce that's imported from faraway places with different growing seasons. If you're a once-a-week shopper, plan to use these freshest ingredients in the first few days, choosing recipes with less perishable ingredients for later in the week.If you regularly throw out produce that's well past its prime, consider buying canned or frozen fruits and vegetables instead. If packaged at their peak of freshness, without added salt or sugar, they're as nutritious as fresh and their staying power makes them more economical.Tip: Frugal shoppers know they can get a price break by buying day-old bread or bagels. And you can make a game of cooking fine foods with produce you picked up at a bargain price just before it became over-ripe. But try reversing the strategy by buying only the freshest items, and they'll last longer in your refrigerator.Find out when the market gets its fish deliveries, for example, and buy fish on that day. You'll find yourself tossing less spoiled food into the trash, often saving dollars at a time.2. Plan for the weekTake some time before you head for the store to plan the week's meals. Make a list and stick to it.Knowing what's in season, plan your meals around what you'll find at the best price this week. Then take things a step further and do as our grandmothers did: Get a roast or a ham, serve it on Sunday, slice it for sandwiches on Monday, and toss in a few veggies to turn the leftovers into a stew or soup on Tuesday.Tip: Avoid throwing away leftover food. Dry bread can morph into croutons, bread pudding, stuffing, or pappa al pomodoro (Italian bread and tomato soup). A peeled banana stored in the freezer can be transformed into next week's banana bread or whirled in the blender with milk and frozen strawberries to make a smoothie a healthy, inexpensive snack for kids and adults. Leftover vegetables can become hearty soups or stews, and even one serving of last night's pasta can be packed up as today's lunch for your hungry preschooler.3. Grow your ownFresh herbs can cost a pretty penny at the grocery store, and many recipes call for such a small amount that most of the bundle gets tossed into the refrigerator for later. Unfortunately, ""later"" seldom seems to come, and the herbs are often rediscovered when it's too late for them to be used.Why not grow your own in sweet little pots on your kitchen window ledge? When a recipe calls for it, you can pinch off a bit of basil, dill, thyme, or chives. And in the meantime, the herb plants will decorate your kitchen nicely.Similarly, tomatoes and many other fruits and vegetables are easy to grow in containers. Some, like certain lettuces and cabbages, are so pretty, they're ornamental too. Strawberries have charming flowers and foliage. So if you have a yard, deck, or even just a small, sunny balcony, you can turn a little sunshine and water into both a garden oasis and grocery savings. Check your local library for books on container gardening.4. Enjoy romantic dinners at homeLonging for a dreamy evening with your partner but loath to spring for a pricey restaurant? With a little forethought, you can feed the baby, put her down for the night, and cook yourselves a gourmet meal at home. What you save on a babysitter you can spend on special ingredients. Three cooking tricks1. Cook and freezeDouble the recipe of that casserole, stew, or lasagna or make twice as much cookie dough and pop half into the freezer for the future. It's cheaper to buy ingredients in bulk, so you'll save time and money.Tip: Don't have much freezer space? Form a dinner co-op with another family. Each family chooses one day a week to make a double batch of whatever's for dinner, and the other family picks up their share that night. Both families save time and have a night off cooking without the extra expense of takeout food.2. Make it from scratchThe price of a homemade cake is minimal, compared with a bakery cake, and your own pot roast and special lasagna are almost certainly tastier and less expensive than store-bought versions. Delicious one-dish dinners can be created using your own noodles, tomato products and spices rather than the contents of a single box. But that doesn't mean that you should make everything from scratch.Bottled salad dressing definitely costs more than tossing your salad with oil and vinegar, but some products, like mayonnaise, are tricky and time consuming to make. Others, like spaghetti sauce, cost less if you purchase a jarred version on sale than if you buy all the ingredients and cook them up. (On the other hand, if you grow your own tomatoes, homemade spaghetti sauce becomes a cheap staple.)Tip: Buy a small food processor or baby-food mill and puree leftovers or freshly cooked food into healthy, tasty baby food. Not only does this cost less than jarred baby food, but you can gradually introduce your baby to the flavors that are favorites with your family.3. Eat meat sparingly (or not at all)The priciest portion of most Americans' diets is meat. And nutritionists continue to urge us all to eat more vegetables. You can reduce expenses and build nutritious habits at the same time simply by introducing some vegetarian entrees into your cooking repertoire.Start slowly, maybe by introducing one meatless meal per week. Many families  and even some schools  favor ""meatless Mondays."" Try a vegetable-loaded lasagna, serve bean-filled tacos, or make a stir-fry with marinated tofu (peanut sauce makes a great marinade for young palates) and your family's favorite vegetables.As your family becomes more comfortable with less meat, experiment with other delicious vegetarian entrees. It might take some extra thought to prepare dishes that pack plenty of iron and protein, but your grocery bill will soon look a lot less beefy."
Plus-size and pregnant: Understanding and managing health risks,https://www.babycenter.com/0_plus-size-and-pregnant-understanding-and-managing-health-ris_1504842.bc,"Most plus-size women can expect to have a healthy pregnancy. But if you're carrying extra weight going into pregnancy, youre more susceptible to pregnancy complications like gestational diabetes. Understanding your risk factors will help you do everything you can to enjoy a safe and healthy plus-size pregnancy.You're considered overweight if your pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) is between 25 and 29.9 and obese if your BMI is 30 or higher. It's healthy to have a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9. (Not sure what yours is? Find out your BMI.)Keep in mind that BMI is only a rough estimate of body fat based on your height and weight: It doesn't take genetics or age into consideration, and it isn't a perfect tool for assessing overall fitness. Nevertheless, researchers have consistently found that as BMI increases, so does the risk of many pregnancy and labor complications.And although having a BMI between 18.5 and 24.9 is considered normal, it isn't typical: More than half of pregnant women in the United States have a BMI of 25 or higher and more than a third have a BMI of 30 and above.Risk reality checkDoctors and researchers still don't know exactly why weight matters. And it's just one piece of the puzzle  age, genetics, and ethnicity also factor in.""The impact of obesity is different for every ethnic group,"" says Gladys Ramos, an ob-gyn who has researched race, weight, and pregnancy complications. ""For example, Latina women have a higher rate of gestational diabetes and preeclampsia, compared with Caucasian women. African-American women have a higher rate of c-section than do heavier Caucasian women. Caucasian women tend to form bigger babies, while African-American women do not.""The good news is that most health conditions and situations linked to weight are manageable  and in some cases preventable. So you may not experience any and go on to have a perfectly healthy pregnancy and delivery.""Most plus-size women have completely normal pregnancies and normal babies,"" says Cornelia van der Ziel, an ob-gyn and coauthor of Big, Beautiful, and Pregnant: Expert Advice and Comforting Wisdom for the Expecting Plus-Size Woman. ""You can be overweight and have a fit pregnancy. Any obese pregnant woman can modify her risks by eating well, exercising, and adhering to weight-gain guidelines.""According to Sujatha Reddy, an ob-gyn in Atlanta, the most important thing you can do is have a conversation with your healthcare provider about your particular risk factors. Do you have a history of high blood pressure or uncontrolled blood sugar? What about a family history of larger babies?Once you know your personal risk factors, work with your healthcare provider to make sure you have the healthiest pregnancy you can. And don't panic: As Reddy says, ""It's not a doom-and-gloom scenario at all.""(Do you think your healthcare provider is treating you with respect? If not, read about how to find a plus-size-friendly healthcare provider.)Health conditions and situationsHere are some conditions and situations you and your healthcare provider may need to be mindful of during your pregnancy:Neural tube defects: Neural tube defects (NTDs) are problems with how a baby's brain and spinal cord develop. The overall risk is very small (around 1 in 1,000 births, according to the Duke University Center for Human Genetics), but overweight and obese women are twice as likely to have a baby with an NTD as are women at a normal weight.What you can do: Researchers aren't sure why obese women have higher rates of NTDs, which makes it hard to give specific recommendations. But they do know that folic acid can help to prevent NTDs, and some studies have found that plus-size women may have lower blood folate levels than smaller women. Consider asking your doctor if you should boost your folic acid intake higher than the recommended daily amounts of 400 mcg before conception, and 600 mcg during pregnancy.You can also ask your healthcare provider for a quad screen blood test at 15 weeks to screen for NTDs. If that test suggests a possible problem, ultrasound,and amniocentesis can provide more information.Gestational diabetes: This condition causes elevated blood sugar during pregnancy. Your healthcare provider will evaluate your blood sugar during glucose screening and tolerance tests, which are usually done between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. (They may be done earlier if you're at higher risk.)Uncontrolled levels of high blood sugar can cause a variety of problems, including hypoglycemia (low blood sugar) in your baby after birth and having a large baby. (These babies may have larger shoulders, which increases the risk of shoulder dystocia  a rare but serious situation in which the baby becomes stuck behind the mother's pubic bone during delivery.) And children of mothers who have gestational diabetes are at higher risk of becoming obese or developing type 2 diabetes.Nearly 5 percent of pregnant women develop diabetes, and the risk increases along with BMI: Overweight women are twice as likely to have gestational diabetes, and obese women are four to eight times as likely to have it.What you can do: Learn about gestational diabetes and how you can manage it with nutrition. You can also get more information from the American Diabetes Association. Even if you have gestational diabetes, you can have a healthy pregnancy if you follow your healthcare provider's advice and attend all your prenatal appointments. Preeclampsia: Also known as toxemia, preeclampsia is a serious condition that's diagnosed after 20 weeks of pregnancy if you have high blood pressure along with at least one other symptom. These can include protein in your urine, liver or kidney abnormalities, persistent headaches, or vision changes.It causes blood vessels to constrict, which raises your blood pressure and decreases blood flow through your body.Preeclampsia can range from mild to severe and progress slowly or rapidly. In severe cases, it can cause organ damage to you and problems for your baby, such as poor growth, less amniotic fluid, and placental abruption. Severe cases can lead to seizures, a condition called eclampsia. Women with severe preeclampsia are given antiseizure medication.Reddy notes that while weight is a major risk factor, other factors  such as age  are more significant. ""If you're under age 35 and overweight, you're at a lower risk for preeclampsia than a woman at a healthy weight who's 35 or older,"" Reddy says.Pregnancy swelling (edema) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:50Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:50Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Get tips for prevention and when to call your doctor. See all pregnancy videosResearch shows that about 6 to 12 percent of overweight and obese women will be diagnosed with preeclampsia, while about 4 percent of women with a BMI in the normal range will be diagnosed.What you can do: Attend all your prenatal appointments, so your healthcare provider can check your blood pressure. If your blood pressure is high, your provider will test your urine for protein.Call your healthcare provider right away if you experience puffiness or swelling in your face, swelling in your extremities, a severe or persistent headache, rapid weight gain, intense pain or tenderness in your upper abdomen, or vision changes (like double vision, blurriness, spots or flashing lights, sensitivity to light, or a temporary loss of vision). Learn more about preeclampsia and how it's managed.Gestational hypertension: If you develop high blood pressure (a reading of 140 over 90 or higher  even if only one of the numbers is elevated) after 20 weeks of pregnancy but don't have any symptoms of preeclampsia, you'll be diagnosed with gestational hypertension, sometimes called pregnancy-induced hypertension.If you had high blood pressure before pregnancy, or are diagnosed with it before 20 weeks of pregnancy, that's called chronic hypertension. Chronic hypertension is a heart risk, but gestational hypertension is usually mild and probably won't cause any noticeable problems for you or your baby. However, it does put you at higher risk for preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, preterm birth, placental abruption, and stillbirth.Several studies have shown that roughly 10 percent of obese women have gestational hypertension, versus around 4 percent of women with normal BMI.What you can do: Go to all your prenatal appointments  your healthcare provider will take your blood pressure at each visit. If you have either type of hypertension, she will monitor your health closely and possibly put you on blood-pressure-lowering medication. Learn more about gestational hypertension and how it's managed.Large baby: While most plus-size women have average-size babies (around 7 pounds), obesity is considered a risk factor for macrosomia, or having a large baby (at least 9 pounds, 15 ounces). About 1 percent of babies are macrosomic. Your baby is more likely to be large if you have undiagnosed or poorly managed gestational diabetes, have a family history of large babies, or go past your due date.If your fundal measurements  the distance from your pubic bone to the top of your uterus  indicate you're measuring large for dates, that may mean you're carrying a large baby, but it could also be due to a large amount of amniotic fluid (fundal measurements are more likely to be inaccurate in plus-size women). An ultrasound is a more accurate estimate of fetal size. However, the only real proof of a macrosomic baby is the postbirth weigh-in.What you can do: If you have gestational diabetes, work with a nutritionist to keep your blood sugar levels in check and talk with your provider. If your healthcare provider suspects your baby is large, ask her about your options. Depending on your situation, she may suggest a trial of labor to see if vaginal delivery is possible before turning to a cesarean, or she may recommend a planned c-section. Learn more about macrosomia.Longer labor: Several studies have found that higher BMI is linked to longer active labor. For women in the highest ranges for BMI, the first stage of labor typically lasts more than an hour longer than it does for normal-weight women. But this doesn't necessarily mean you will be in labor longer, says van der Ziel.What you can do: Exercising, eating a sensible diet, and gaining the appropriate amount of weight may affect the length of labor, says van der Ziel. Prepare yourself for labor with childbirth preparation classes and exercises that can ease labor, and consider hiring a labor coach. A positive mindset also helps, van der Ziel adds  so go into labor with confidence in your body's ability to handle it.Labor complications: A number of studies have shown that overweight and obese women are more likely to be induced or have a cesarean delivery. Obese women also may have more difficulty getting effective pain relief from an epidural or spinal block.Recent studies have found that overweight women are roughly 50 percent more likely to have a c-section than women who are at a normal weight, and obese women are twice as likely to have a cesarean.This is likely due to the other factors that can be associated with being plus-size and pregnant: If you're in labor for a long time, or have preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, or other health complications, your healthcare provider may be more likely to recommend a c-section, either scheduled or as an intervention if problems arise during labor.What you can do: Talk to your healthcare provider. Does she consider you at high risk for a c-section? If so, why? Ask about her c-section rate and her philosophy about c-sections in general.If you have no serious health problems, is she fine with trying vaginal delivery? During a vaginal delivery, what might cause her to order a c-section intervention?Also, you may lower your odds of having a c-section by following your doctor's recommendations for weight gain, exercising during pregnancy, and taking childbirth preparation classes. Learn more about having a c-section and what the recovery is like.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2011a. Committee opinion 504: Screening and diagnosis of gestational diabetes mellitus.

Breastfeeding a baby with special needs,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-a-baby-with-special-needs_8481.bc,"The benefits of breastfeeding a baby with special needsLearning to breastfeed can be difficult for any new mother, but if your baby is born prematurely, or with a congenital condition such as Down syndrome or a cleft lip or palate, breastfeeding becomes even more challenging. Nursing can be a calming respite from the emotional ups and downs of raising a special-needs baby, though, and your child will reap the nutritional and immunological benefits of breast milk, which can be especially valuable for a baby with special needs.""A baby with a cleft lip or palate, for example, is often more prone to developing upper respiratory problems such as colds, allergies, and ear infections,"" says Aimee Creelman, a lactation consultant and obstetric nurse at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital in Southern Vermont. ""Many studies show that these babies do much better when they get their mother's milk.""Breast milk can help prevent the respiratory infections and bowel problems that are common with Down syndrome, too. And because it's easily digestible, breast milk also helps babies with heart problems or cystic fibrosis gain needed weight.""Breast milk can help protect your baby from infections during surgery and help them heal afterward,"" says Jan Barger, a lactation consultant in Wheaton, Illinois. ""Sometimes a mom feels helpless while the doctors are busily trying to help her child, but breastfeeding is something that only Mom can do for her baby.""Breastfeeding may also comfort a mother through some of the rough patches of mothering a baby with special needs, says Barger, and may help her feel closer to her baby as well.5 simple breastfeeding positions Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:47Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:47Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videos Challenges of nursing a special-needs babyBecause a baby's special needs may affect his ability to suck, he may need a little extra help when it comes to breastfeeding.For example, a baby with a cleft lip or palate, which is the fourth most common birth defect, may have difficulty latching on to your breast. The cleft palate, an opening in the roof of the mouth that goes up to the inner chambers of the nose, makes it hard for a baby to create an airtight seal on the breast.Your baby's sucking ability will depend on the size of the cleft, as well as on the size of your breast and the compressibility of your areola (the circle of skin surrounding your nipple).""A compressible, soft areola works best for a baby with a cleft palate, because if the breast is soft enough, it can press into the palate and suction can be created,"" Creelman says.Some babies with Down syndrome do well at breastfeeding. But some may have muscles that are either poorly developed (""hypotonic"") or too stiff (""hypertonic""). Either condition can make it difficult to position him at your breast.In addition, he may not have the energy to suckle effectively and transfer milk well enough to gain weight.The small jaw and receding chin that are symptomatic of Pierre Robin syndrome, a rare condition, can also make it very difficult to breastfeed.Just because your baby has been diagnosed with one of these conditions doesn't necessarily mean you won't be able to nurse. ""The amount that a disability affects breastfeeding depends on the degree and type of the condition,"" Barger says. ""The only condition that I know of where you absolutely can't breastfeed is galactosemia, when the baby can't metabolize lactose (the primary sugar in breastmilk)."" Tips for successfully nursing your baby with special needsAlthough the challenges are different for different conditions, many of the solutions are similar. The first step is to establish your milk supply. If your baby doesn't take to your breast immediately, start pumping as soon as possible after the birth and pump every two to three hours, as often as a baby would nurse.It's also important to make sure you stay well-nourished and well rested. ""There's a lot of stress and anxiety for a mom whose newborn is in intensive care and that can affect milk supply,"" Creelman says. ""Our emotions play a big role in our milk's ability to let down.""It's easy to become overwhelmed by concern for your baby and your desire to establish a bond, but these emotions can become detrimental to breastfeeding. ""I always encourage moms to try and approach the first feeding without too much expectation,"" says Creelman. ""The first feeding attempts are times to snuggle and let the baby be close to your breasts. Just let it be a good, close bonding experience.""Sometimes this connection can lead naturally to breastfeeding. Creelman recommends kangaroo care, or cuddling skin-to-skin with blankets over you and your baby.""This helps the mother build her milk supply and can often segue into breastfeeding,"" she says. ""Sometimes the baby will just start licking and rooting and moving her head toward the breast. It's just one of those magic moments.""Read more about how to bond with your premature baby in the neonatal intensive care unit.Once you have established your milk supply and created a bond with your baby, it might be necessary to try specialfeeding positionsor equipment. A baby with Down syndrome or who was born prematurely with poorly developed muscles needs a lot of physical support of the head and upper back.Creelman recommends the football position, in which you hold your baby under your arm on the same side you're nursing from, so you can support the baby's chin and jaw with the same hand that's supporting your breast.On the other hand, if your baby's muscles are stiff, he may tend to arch her body when you try to nurse her. In this case, it may help to swaddle her before settling in to nurse. (Watch our video on how to swaddle a baby.)Positioning is also critical for a baby with Pierre Robin syndrome. Because of the underdeveloped muscles in herjaw and throat, the baby's tongue can actually fall back in her mouth when she's trying to breastfeed while on her back or side. Unless she is positioned virtually on her stomach, with Mom lying beneath, she will not be able to breathe.If your baby is sleepy or placid (as is the case with many babies who have Down syndrome or other neurological disorders), you'll want to wake her up completely before breastfeeding and nurse her frequently throughout the day. Breast compression will help keep your milk flowing (and your baby from dozing while she's feeding). It can also help a baby who isn't sucking well.To use breast compression while breastfeeding or pumping, place your hand around your breast, thumb on one side, a couple of inches back from the nipple. As your baby nurses, alternately apply and release pressure.Sometimes, despite your best efforts, a baby with special needs is slow to take to the breast. Until she's breastfeeding effectively, you can help your baby get the nourishment she needs with the help of some special breastfeeding equipment, such as Lact-Aid or the Supplemental Nursing System (SNS) by Medela.These systems consist of a small bottle with a feeding tube. You fill the bottle with breast milk that you've pumped (or supplemental formula, if your baby needs it), then hang the bottle around your neck and tape the tube to your breast. When your baby nurses, she takes both your breast and the feeding tube into her mouth.You can also make a similar feeding system using a number 5 French feeding tube that's 36 inches long and a baby bottle or syringe without a needle. (These supplies are available at medical supply stores.) It would be helpful to have a lactation consultant show you how to set up and use an SNS.""An SNS decreases the length of time feedings take, and you don't run the risk of creating a nipple preference for the bottle,"" Barger says.It's generally best to avoid bottles and pacifiers, because a baby may get used to the feel of the rubber nipples and refuse to go back to the breast, a situation known asnipple preference.But in some cases, a bottle can help. For babies with a cleft palate, for example, Creelman recommends the Special Needs Feeder, a bottle made by Medela. ""It has a soft silicone nipple that's a bit elongated and a chamber so the person who is doing the feeding controls the flow, based on how well the baby's doing,"" Creelman says.Another helpful accessory is a nipple shield, which gives more definition and firmness to the nipple. ""This can help a baby who is having difficulty latching on,"" Barger says.Don't hesitate to try aids for breastfeeding if they're needed, but it's a good idea to try breastfeeding without them first. ""In general, you want to use as few interventions as possible and make things as natural as you can,"" says Barger.By the way, a fairly common condition called tongue-tie (or ankyloglossia) can also affect a baby's ability to nurse. Learn about breastfeeding a baby with tongue-tie. Where to get more helpBabies with special needs should have routine checkups with a pediatrician to ensure that they are developing normally and healthily. You'll also need emotional support from your doctor, partner, and family, since learning to breastfeed your baby will require a lot of patience and flexibility.""One of the best things to do is talk to other mothers who have been there,"" says Barger. Your hospital should be able to refer you to a support group. You can also try these resources:La Leche League International (LLLI) provides support for breastfeeding mothers.

Vomiting in toddlers,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vomiting-in-toddlers_11395.bc,"What should I do if my toddler's vomiting?Throwing up is usually no cause for alarm. But in some cases it can signal a serious health problem. Here's how to tell when your toddler's vomiting needs immediate medical attention  and how to deal with vomiting that doesn't need a doctor's care.Call 911 immediately if:Your toddler's having trouble breathingHe shows signs of severe dehydration, like sunken eyes, cold, splotchy hands and feet, excessive sleepiness, fussiness, or lightheadedness, dizziness, or deliriumTake your toddler to the emergency room if:He has severe abdominal pain. Your toddler can't explain exactly where he hurts, but you know him best and can probably tell when he's in considerable pain. He could have a blockage in his bowel or some other problem that needs immediate attention.The vomit contains bile (a green substance) or blood that resembles dark coffee grounds. The doctor will probably want to see a sample of the vomit if it contains blood or bile, so as distasteful as it is, you should try to save some in a plastic baggie. Green bile can indicate that the intestines are blocked, a condition that needs immediate attention.He has a swollen, tender abdomen. This could indicate a buildup of fluid or gas, a blocked intestine, a hernia, or some other digestive tract problem. Blockages are uncommon but serious.He vomits more than once after suffering a head injury, which may indicate a concussion.He's vomiting and very irritable or lethargic. He may have a stiff neck, a hallmark sign of meningitis.Call your toddler's doctor if:Your child has been vomiting for more than 24 hours. For some illnesses, this is perfectly normal, but check with the doctor to be sure.He shows signs of becoming dehydrated, including decreased urination (more than six to eight hours without a wet diaper), dry lips and mouth, crying without tears, lethargy, and dark yellow urine.The vomit contains blood. A little blood in the vomit is usually nothing to worry about, as the force of vomiting can cause tiny tears in the blood vessels lining the esophagus. Your toddler's vomit may also be tinged with red if he's swallowed blood from a cut in his mouth or a nosebleed within the last six hours. But call the doctor if he continues to have blood in his vomit or the amount increases. As mentioned above, if the blood resembles dark coffee grounds, go to the emergency room right away.He shows signs of fatigue and jaundice (a yellowing of the skin or whites of the eyes). Jaundice accompanied by pain in the upper right side of the abdomen may signal hepatitis.Call a poison control center if:You suspect your toddler has swallowed something toxic. Call the American Association of Poison Control Center's national emergency hot line at (800) 222-1222 or your local poison control center immediately. If you can identify what he's swallowed  for example, you find an empty medicine bottle  tell the medical experts what it is, and they'll give you exact instructions for taking care of your child.Experts used to tell parents to keep either syrup of ipecac or activated charcoal on hand for poisoning emergencies. But that's no longer the case: Ipecac is not an effective treatment for poisoning  most emergency rooms don't even use it anymore  and activated charcoal hasn't been proven a safe or effective remedy to give children at home.If you have ipecac in your home, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that you dispose of it immediately and safely. (Never throw away any medications in a garbage can that your toddler can get into.) How can I keep my toddler from getting dehydrated?Dehydration can be a serious problem for young children, and if your toddler is vomiting (or has a fever or diarrhea), he's losing precious fluids.One way to keep your toddler hydrated when he's been vomiting is to give him an electrolyte solution as soon as he's able to keep liquids down. (Such solutions are sold over the counter in most drugstores  ask your pharmacist.)Don't force your toddler to drink the electrolyte solution when he's still actively vomiting (every five or ten minutes). But after his tummy's been calm for half an hour or so, offer him slow, frequent sips  say 1 teaspoon (5 cc) every ten minutes for a couple of hours. Then  if he tolerates that well  increase the amount to 2 teaspoons (10 cc) every five minutes. Continue to progress slowly until the vomiting eases up.These electrolyte solutions are very mild and easy on the stomach, but if your toddler won't take them, try giving him clear liquids such as water or broth. Juices sometimes make matters worse (especially if your child also has diarrhea), but if juice is the only liquid your child will drink, don't increase the amount he normally drinks in a day, but dilute it half and half with water. (So if he usually drinks 3 or 4 ounces of juice in a day, you might dilute this to 6 or 8 ounces of liquid.) He might also enjoy ice pops or slushies made from electrolyte solutions or diluted juices. Don't give him carbonated drinks, though, as they're terrible for his teeth and won't help settle his stomach.What about medications?Don't give your toddler any prescription or over-the-counter anti-nausea medication unless his doctor recommends it.And never give medications containing aspirin to a child. Aspirin can make children susceptible to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal illness.Are there any safe home remedies?If your little one will drink it, you can brew up a tummy-friendly tea such as chamomile, peppermint, or ginger. To prevent scalding, serve it warm, not hot. When can my toddler eat solids again?Once your toddler's vomiting diminishes or stops and his appetite returns, you can slowly reintroduce other fluids (including milk) as well as healthful foods. The AAP recommends that a child recovering from stomach troubles resume a normal diet as soon as possible: Offer whatever solid foods your child normally eats, including complex carbohydrates (like breads, cereals, and rice), lean meats, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables, but steer clear of fatty foods.This differs from the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) that doctors used to prescribe. Studies show that reintroducing a standard diet can actually shorten recovery time by half a day because it restores essential nutrients the body needs to fight infection. If your toddler misses a few days' worth of good nutrition because his bug kills his appetite, don't worry. Just make sure you keep him hydrated.By the way, doctors vary on how they feel about milk consumption after vomiting; you might want to discuss this with your toddler's doctor.Why is my toddler vomiting?Children vomit for a number of reasons. And while it's always disconcerting for you and scary for your toddler  it may even make him cry  vomiting usually isn't serious. (For guidance on when to see a doctor, see the first section of this article.) You'll want to find out what's causing it, though, both to confirm that he's okay and to make him more comfortable. If your child vomits once and that's the end of it, maybe he just ate too much at his last meal. If he continues to vomit, possible causes include:Viral or bacterial infectionA stomach flu or other intestinal illness is the most likely culprit. If a virus or bacteria have infected your toddler's stomach lining or intestines, he may also have diarrhea, loss of appetite, abdominal pain, and fever. The vomiting usually stops within 12 to 24 hours.Other infectionsCongestion or a respiratory infection, such as a cold, can also lead to vomiting, especially while your toddler's coughing. A urinary tract infection and even an ear infection can sometimes cause nausea and vomiting. Throwing up can also be a symptom of serious illnesses like pneumonia, meningitis, appendicitis, and, in rare cases, Reye's syndrome.Motion sicknessSome children tend to get motion sickness, which can be a problem if your daily routine includes a car trip. Experts believe that motion sickness happens when there's a disconnect between what your toddler sees and what he senses with the motion-sensitive parts of his body, such as his inner ears and some nerves.Poisonous substanceYour toddler could be vomiting if he's swallowed something toxic, like a drug, plant, medicine, or chemical. Or he may have gotten food poisoning from contaminated food or water.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.Excessive cryingA prolonged bout of crying or coughing can trigger the gag reflex and make your toddler throw up. Although it's troubling for both of you, throwing up during a crying spell won't physically harm your toddler. If he appears otherwise healthy, there's no reason to be concerned. Can I do anything to prevent vomiting?Yes, several strategies are worth trying:To help minimize motion sickness, schedule plenty of stops during your trips to give your toddler a chance to get some fresh air and calm his tummy. Give him a small snack before the trip  having something in his stomach will help. And offer plenty of fluids to keep him hydrated; otherwise he may get headachy or even dizzy or weak, which will only make him more miserable.You can give your child certain medications for motion sickness, but you'll want to know how they affect him before starting out on a trip. These medicines may cause drowsiness or dry mouth and nose (keep those fluids handy), but sometimes they have the opposite effect and cause irritability and hyperactivity. If you want to give one a try, ask your toddler's doctor for advice. Motion sickness patches are not for use on children under age 12, so don't cut one in half to deliver a smaller dose to your toddler.Show sources Hide sources AAP. Undated. Treatment of vomiting.

Food poisoning (ages 3 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_food-poisoning-ages-3-to-8_66337.bc,"How can I tell whether my preschooler has food poisoning?Food poisoning, which is usually caused by eating food or drinking water that's contaminated with one of several kinds of nasty bacteria, can be hard to distinguish from a stomach virus, which is usually picked up on the hands and transferred to the mouth. The symptoms are the same: abdominal cramping, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and often fever, chills, achiness, and headache.If your preschooler has food poisoning, the symptoms will likely appear two to 48 hours after eating the food and will usually last a day or two but can continue in severe cases for a week or more.How can I tell what kind of food poisoning my child has?Testing of blood, stool, and leftover food may identify the bacteria when necessary, but often the doctor won't need to identify the exact culprit because the treatment is the same regardless. (In fact, the treatment is the same for a stomach virus, too.) There are exceptions, though. If there's blood in your toddler's stool, for example, the doctor will test to make sure that he doesn't have food poisoning that's caused by a potentially dangerous bacteria, like E. coli 0157:H7, Shigella, or Salmonella.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the most common food-borne infections are those caused by the bacteria Campylobacter, Salmonella, and E. coli 0157:H7, as well as by a group of viruses called noroviruses. Less common  but dangerous if left untreated  is botulism. Here's a quick look at these bacteria:Campylobacter is the most frequently diagnosed food-borne bacterium. It's usually transmitted through raw or undercooked poultry or unpasteurized milk, but your child can also get it from contaminated water. It's not usually spread from person to person, but it can be. (If your child has it and has diarrhea, for example, you could possibly get it from cleaning him up.)It's also possible to contract the bacteria from the stool of a dog or cat. Campylobacter often goes undiagnosed because there are sometimes no symptoms, but signs can include nausea and vomiting, diarrhea (sometimes bloody), cramping, abdominal pain, and fever. It usually lasts for two to five days, but can linger for up to ten days.Salmonella can be present in raw or undercooked eggs, poultry and meat, raw milk and dairy products, and seafood, and can be spread by food handlers. Reptiles like pet iguanas, turtles, lizards, and snakes can also carry Salmonella. In most cases, if your child has a bout of Salmonella, he'll develop fever, diarrhea, and abdominal cramps. He may also have tiny pink spots on his skin.Symptoms usually start eight to 48 hours after contact and last for a day or two, though they can persist for more than a week, and the bacteria can continue to exist in the body for months. Two-thirds of patients with Salmonella are under 20 years old. In a person with a compromised immune system, Salmonella can invade the bloodstream and become life threatening.E. coli is transmitted through food or water that's contaminated with microscopic amounts of cow feces. (If a person has E. coli and doesn't wash her hands after using the toilet, she can also spread it to another person.) E. coli can cause severe, sometimes bloody diarrhea and painful abdominal cramps, without much of a fever.There are a number of strains of Escherichia coli. E. coli 0157:H7 is a particular strain that causes a more severe, longer-lasting illness. In babies and young children, E. coli 0157:H7 can be life threatening and often requires hospitalization. Symptoms can begin eight to 48 hours after your child eats a food contaminated with the bacteria and last about two to five days.Norovirus is also called Norwalk-like virus (NLVs) or calicivirus, because it belongs to the Caliciviridae virus family. This very common virus isn't often diagnosed because a lab test for it isn't widely available. Severe vomiting is the hallmark sign, and it usually begins suddenly, about 24 to 48 hours after contact with the virus, although symptoms can show up as early as 12 hours.A norovirus is transmitted through contaminated food, utensils, and surfaces. Because it's highly contagious, it spreads easily in daycare facilities and homes. There are many strains of norovirus, so it's hard to develop immunity to them. A case of norovirus usually goes away on its own in one to two days, but in the meantime you'll want to make sure that your child doesn't get dehydrated because of the vomiting.Botulism is fairly rare  there are only about 110 cases in the United States each year. It's caused by the bacteria Clostridium botulinum, which is found in soil. But it's most often transmitted through improperly canned or preserved food, especially home-canned vegetables, cured pork and ham, smoked or raw fish, honey, and corn syrup.Infant botulism happens when a baby eats the bacteria or its spores, and they then grow in his intestinal tract. (This is why you should never feed honey to a baby before his first birthday.) Symptoms of botulism include constipation, weakness, droopy eyelids, and difficulty swallowing. (The child will be alert, though, despite his weakness.) Left untreated, botulism can progress to muscle and respiratory paralysis. The symptoms usually show up in eight to 36 hours.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.When should I call the doctor?You'll want to let the doctor know what's going on as soon as you suspect your child might have food poisoning. She can decide if your child's symptoms warrant an office visit. Tell the doctor about any of the following signs:a fever higher than 103 degrees Fahrenheitvomiting for more than three dayssevere headaches or abdominal painblood in the stool or vomita swollen, hard bellyAlso call your doctor if your child shows any of the classic signs of dehydration, including decreased urination, excessive sleepiness or fussiness, cool and discolored hands and feet, or extreme thirst. If this happens, your child's doctor might want to admit him to the hospital (or just keep him there for a few hours) for IV rehydration. Don't be alarmed. Odds are, he'll be released and back to his healthy self within a few days' time.If you're concerned that your child may have food poisoning and your doctor isn't available, speak to the doctor on call or take your child to the emergency room.If your preschooler is having trouble breathing or swallowing, or shows any signs of severe dehydration, call 911.What can I do to ease my child's symptoms?Assuming your child has a run-of-the-mill case of food poisoning, with vomiting or diarrhea, you'll want to keep him home to rest and replace the lost fluids and electrolytes (salt and minerals) that his body is losing. Usually, doctors recommend giving an over-the-counter oral electrolyte solution, such as Equalyte or Pedialyte (which is also sold as ice pops), by offering small sips frequently throughout the day. Your doctor can tell you how much your child needs to be drinking based on his age and weight. (Avoid juices and sodas, though, because these may make his symptoms worse.)If your child has a fever or is achy, you can give him the proper dose of children's acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Never give your child aspirin as it makes him more susceptible to Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal disease.When can my child go back to eating normally?Once your child's vomiting and diarrhea lessens or stops, and his appetite returns, your doctor will likely recommend that you stop giving him the electrolyte solution as you slowly reintroduce other fluids, including milk, as well as healthful food. Follow your child's cues  he'll let you know when he feels hungry.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children recovering from stomach troubles resume a normal diet as soon as possible  one that includes such staples as complex carbohydrates (like bread, cereal, and rice), lean meat, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables. Avoid fatty food.Note that this recommendation is different from the BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) that doctors used to prescribe. ""The BRAT diet used to be very commonly advocated, but we no longer recommend it because it lacks certain vital nutrients, such as protein,"" says William John Cochran, an associate professor of pediatrics at the Geisinger Clinic in Danville, Pennsylvania.Studies show that reintroducing a standard diet soon after acute symptoms ease can actually shorten the duration of a child's illness by half a day because it restores essential nutrients to his system necessary to fight infection. On the other hand, if your child misses a few days' worth of good nutrition because his illness just kills his appetite, don't worry. Just make sure you keep him hydrated.How can I help protect my child from contracting food-borne illness again?The truth is, it's impossible to protect your child from all food-borne bacteria. But you can certainly help decrease his odds of exposure by using proper food preparation practices at home. Try these:Always wash your hands with warm water and soap before preparing food or after going to the bathroom or helping your child with the potty or changing a diaper. Teach your child to wash his hands after he uses the potty and before he eats. Help him until he can do a good job on his own.Rinse meat, poultry, and fish thoroughly before cooking it, and wash all kitchen surfaces well afterward with hot, sudsy water.Never put cooked food, like a steak, back on a plate or cutting board that held uncooked food.Defrost food in the refrigerator, not on the countertop or in the sink. Don't eat meat, poultry, or fish that has been refrigerated uncooked for more than one or two days.Don't use food that looks or smells unusual.Don't use outdated food, packaged food that has a broken seal, or cans that are dented or misshapen.Don't leave food outside the refrigerator for more than an hour before eating or drinking it.Make sure food is cooked well. Use a meat thermometer: Beef should be at least 160 degrees F, poultry at least 180 degrees F, and fish at least 140 degrees F.When reheating food, be sure to do so thoroughly. (Don't just warm it.)Keep hot food hot and cold food cold before eating it.Don't give your child unpasteurized milk, juice, or cheese, or raw meat.If you can your own produce, follow canning instructions carefully.Buy all meat and fish from reputable stores.When traveling out of the country, eat hot, freshly cooked food  not raw vegetables or unpeeled fruit  and drink only water that's been boiled."
Top 5 parenting fears and what you can do about them,https://www.babycenter.com/0_top-5-parenting-fears-and-what-you-can-do-about-them_3656609.bc,"We recently polled more than 2,400 BabyCenter parents to find out what keeps them up at night. Your fears ranged from concerns about your kids' future to their personal safety to their long-term health  and back again.This made us wonder: Are our kids really at risk, or is worry simply woven into our parental DNA?In general, parents and nonparents alike tend to fear the things they can't control. Parents also tend to be particularly afraid of lurid and sensational hazards, those that draw media attention and make for movie-of-the-week melodramas.Alfred Sacchetti, an emergency room doctor in Camden, New Jersey, and spokesman for the American College of Emergency Physicians, says it's common for parents to worry more about their child being abducted by a stranger than about his riding in a car without a seat belt or playing near an ungated swimming pool  even though car- and water-related accidents pose a far greater threat to kids than abduction.""Unfortunately, a lot of what we're exposed to on TV is designed to generate ratings rather than educate parents,"" says Sacchetti. ""Our access to information doesn't keep up with our access to entertainment.""We consulted Sacchetti and a host of other experts to find out how your fears stack up against the facts and what you can do to keep your child safe.1. Great expectationsThe Fear: I'm afraid my child won't get the education and opportunities she needs to reach her potential.This was the top fear of the parents in our survey. This surprised us, given that we polled the parents of relatively young children. It didn't surprise author Pamela Paul, however, who has spent the past few years examining the mammoth baby-products marketing machine for her book Parenting Inc.In the book, Paul shows how parental anxiety fuels this lucrative industry. Marketers feed the fear, claiming ""educational"" toys and products and early reading programs will put your child on the fast track to success  before he's even out of diapers.Paul believes this parental anxiety is a rational reaction to a scary economic climate. ""Underlying a lot of parents' fears is a broad sense of economic insecurity,"" she says. ""Parents are afraid that their children won't have an easy go of it because they aren't having an easy go of it. Many parents today are struggling to make ends meet, and they want a different kind of future for their kids.""The Reality: There's no question that we're living in a time of economic uncertainty: Unemployment and the cost of living are both on the rise, while wages are stagnant and increasing numbers of jobs are going overseas. It makes sense that parents are concerned about their children and how they'll fare in an increasingly competitive world. But this doesn't mean that you should panic and begin grooming your child for the Ivy League the day you bring him home from the hospital.What You Can Do: Paul and other experts agree that it's not necessary to buy every educational toy that hits the market or fill each hour of your child's day with enrichment activities. When it comes to helping your child reach her potential, it turns out that less is often more.""There is evidence that the best thing you can do for your child is to buy fewer things,"" says Paul. ""The average American child gets 70 new toys a year. But it turns out that kids who are more creative actually have fewer toys. Having a small number of simple, basic toys helps children develop their imagination and resourcefulness.""Psychologist Paul Donahue, author of the book Parenting Without Fear, offers a similar perspective. ""Parents think they should do it all for their kids: stimulate them, keep them constantly entertained, do everything for them so they won't have to endure any frustration. They worry that if they don't do these things, their child will somehow fall behind.""Donahue argues that the reverse is actually true: Constant parental hovering makes it difficult for kids to develop independence, resourcefulness, imagination, and basic life skills  all things that will help a child achieve in school and in life.Steven D. Levitt and Stephen J. Dubner explore this issue in their book, Freakonomics, concluding that many of the things parents do to ensure their children's success, from moving to a better neighborhood to exposing them to classical music, have little impact. 2. Stranger dangerThe Fear: I'm afraid someone will hurt or attack my child.It's not surprising that this is a top fear. Protecting your child is one of the most basic parenting instincts. There are few things as awful to contemplate as your child being hurt in a random attack. Our fears are only intensified by the fact that actual attacks on children get a lot of attention in the media, which can make them seem more common.The Reality: According to the Crimes Against Children Research Center (CCRC), based at the University of New Hampshire, parents do have some cause for concern. The latest statistics of reported and confirmed instances of child mistreatment show that about 1 in 100 kids suffered mistreatment or neglect of some kind.But research by CCRC also points to good news: It turns out that the overall incidence of child mistreatment is dropping nationwide. Child physical abuse fell 2 percent from 2008 to 2009, for example, and child sexual abuse fell 5 percent. This continues a downward trend that started in 1992 in reported abuse of children.According to sociologist David Finkelhor, who directs the CCRC, the exact causes of this drop are unclear. He suggests several factors that may play a part, including a decade of relative economic prosperity that began early in the 1990s, as well as an increase in law enforcement, parenting education, and anti-bullying efforts.Finkelhor believes that new medications to treat depression and childhood behavior problems have also played a major role: ""The development and dissemination of new treatments for mental health and other family problems have caused huge changes in our society and I'm sure have an impact on how children are treated,"" he says.What You Can Do: According to Finkelhor, keeping your child safe means simply doing what comes naturally: Stay as tuned in to your child as possible. ""Maintain a close and supportive relationship and keep the channels of communication open so your child will feel comfortable confiding in you if anything occurs,"" he says.It's also important to know that perpetrators of physical abuse of children are usually family members rather than strangers. The best way to make children safer is to help them develop the tools they need to protect themselves.Educate your child in an age-appropriate way about her body and appropriate and inappropriate forms of contact, and encourage her to seek help from you or other adults if she ever feels at risk. Read more about keeping your child safe from sexual abuse. 3. Accidents and injuriesThe Fear: I'm afraid my child will be injured in an accident, like a car accident.The Reality: This is a parenting fear that can't be discounted: According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), motor vehicle injuries are the leading cause of death for children in the United States. In 2008, 968 children 14 years or younger died in car crashes, and roughly 168,000 were injured.The good news is that this is a fear you can do something about. It turns out that 40 percent of the children who died in car crashes in 2008 were unrestrained by a car seat or seat belt, according to the National Highway Traffic Safety Commission, and more than two-thirds of children fatally injured in car accidents were riding with a driver who had been drinking.What You Can Do: A lot, according to experts like Alfred Sacchetti, chief of emergency services at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Camden, New Jersey. ""The vast number of accidental trauma accidents are preventable,"" says Sacchetti.Car seats, seat belts, bike helmets, and commonsense precautions on the playground: Sacchetti says these simple safety measures can make a tremendous amount of difference. ""I'm amazed by how many kids I see riding around in the car unrestrained or riding bikes without a helmet,"" he says.Sacchetti emphasizes that protecting against head injuries is particularly important: ""In the overall scheme of things, medicine today can help a kid survive most things that happen to them  except injury to the neck and up. Severe head injuries are extremely complicated to treat.""He counsels parents to start requiring their children to use helmets when riding bikes, scooters, or skateboards from the earliest ages, so it's something children learn to do automatically.Be sure your children are buckled in and that you are, too. And of course, you should never drink and drive. Learn more about the biggest car seat safety mistakes and how to avoid them. 4. BullyingThe Fear: I'm afraid my child won't fit in socially or will get picked on.The Reality: This is another parenting fear that is impossible to dismiss, since bullying is widespread among American schoolchildren. About 1 in 7 students in kindergarten through high school has either been a bully or a victim of bullying.Bullying should always be taken seriously, experts say, because it's been linked to long-term self-esteem issues, poor school performance, depression, and even suicide. Recent history also demonstrates that bullying can have widespread results. It turns out that bullying operates like a virus: The worst bullies are often children who've been bullied themselves. Studies indicate that most of the school shootings that have occurred around the country in recent years were perpetrated by kids who'd been bullied.Partly as a result of these tragedies, there seems to be increased awareness of the costs and consequences of bullying. Some school districts around the country have introduced anti-bullying programs. These programs establish schoolwide anti-bullying policies and educate children, teachers, and parents about how to recognize and prevent bullying behavior.Bullying expert Minne Fekkes's research, published in the Archives of Pediatric Adolescent Medicine, found that anti-bullying programs can effectively reduce bullying. His findings emphasize that these programs need to be regularly reinforced.""Anti-bullying programs work best if they are re-introduced at the beginning of each school year,"" says Fekkes. ""The policy should be explained, the rules made clear, and good supervision established."" At least 35 states have enacted some type of anti-bullying legislation.What You Can Do: Experts say that children who experience violence at home are more apt to bully others, so it's important to never treat your child violently or allow others to do so.Fekkes urges parents and teachers alike to be proactive and teach children from a young age that they shouldn't tease or call people names. ""It's important to let teachers and administrators know if your child experiences or observes bullying at school,"" Fekkes says. If your child is a bully, take this behavior seriously."" Lobby your child's school to provide anti-bullying programs.Initiate regular discussions with your children about how they treat others and how to handle bullying if they experience or observe it. There are good books about bullying available for children of all ages  the Anti-Defamation League has compiled a comprehensive list.You should also help your child develop the resiliency and skills she needs to protect herself. ""Talk to your child about ways to respond to bullying,"" says Fekkes, ""and even practice scripts that she can use when and if she encounters bullying."" 5. Weighty mattersThe Fear: I'm afraid my child will have weight problems such as obesity or anorexia.The Reality: Both ends of the scale  obesity and severe weight loss  represent serious risks for growing children. Childhood overweight and obesity rates are both on the rise: According to the CDC, childhood obesity has more than tripled in the last 30 years.At the other end of the spectrum, more and more children and teens are developing anorexia or bulimia. What's more, these disorders are showing up more frequently in younger children than they have in the past.What You Can Do: The good news is that you can help protect your child from the dangers of obesity. Nobody  not your child's doctor, not her gym teacher, not the director of the school lunch program, not even your child herself  has as much control over what she eats and how she spends her time as you do.To help your child avoid excessive weight gain, help your child maintain a healthy diet and active lifestyle  and be sure to do so yourself.You are your child's most important role model. Get your family off the couch and get outside and get moving. Harness your child's natural energy  go for a hike, toss a ball around, or play chase.In general, try to help your children develop a healthy relationship with food. Make family meals a daily ritual: Savor both your food and each other's company and serve reasonable portions of nutritious foods. Limit sweets, including juice, as well as fatty and processed foods. Offer your child plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables.California pediatrician Laurel Schultz urges parents to keep the sweets and junk foods in the house to a minimum. ""You don't want to forbid it completely, but your kids get enough of that stuff in the outside world,"" she says. ""If you have it around, it will be a source of temptation. You can't expect your kid to eat just one corn chip!""Fortunately, there's also a lot you can do as a parent to help your child avoid developing an eating disorder. Schultz, who regularly treats children with eating disorders in her San Francisco practice, urges parents to talk to their children about nutrition, exercise, and good health, rather than focusing on calories and weight.""Let your kids know that it's not about being too fat or too thin,"" she says. ""The important thing is to have a healthy body, which means making good food choices and getting regular exercise.""You should also watch out for changes in your child's behavior, Schultz says. Children who are developing anorexia become increasingly secretive and solitary, and may try to hide their weight loss under baggy clothes.Schultz and other experts emphasize that if you suspect that your child is developing an eating disorder, you should get help right away, because early intervention makes a cure far more likely. ""If you can catch anorexia early, it's more likely that your child will overcome it before it takes hold,"" says Schultz. Consult your child's doctor, who will probably recommend that your child also see a therapist and a nutritionist.Get more tips on developing healthy eating habits and giving your child a healthier, longer life.Sound off: How do you fight back against parenting fear?

Common conditions treated in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU),https://www.babycenter.com/0_common-conditions-treated-in-the-neonatal-intensive-care-uni_10300041.bc,"Premature babies and other very sick newborns face some of the same medical issues. Listed below are some medical conditions that may be seen in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).The conditions listed may not be relevant to your baby's situation. We encourage you to read only what you feel would be helpful to you and your child's particular circumstances.To find out more information about specific conditions, visit the March of Dimes website or email your question to askus@marchofdimes.com.AnemiaPremature babies are often anemic. This means that they don't have enough red blood cells. Normally, the fetus stores iron during the latter months of pregnancy and uses it after birth to make red blood cells. Infants born too soon may not have had enough time to store iron.Loss of blood from frequent blood tests also can contribute to anemia. Anemic infants may be treated with dietary iron supplements, drugs that increase red blood cell production, or, in some cases, a blood transfusion.Breathing problemsPremature babies often have breathing problems because their lungs aren't fully developed. Full-term babies also can develop breathing problems due to complications of labor and delivery, birth defects, and infections. An infant with breathing problems may be given medicines, put on a respirator to help him breathe, or use a combination of these two treatments.Apnea: Premature babies sometimes don't breathe regularly. A baby may take a long breath, then a short one, then pause for five to 10 seconds before starting to breathe normally. This is called periodic breathing. It usually isn't harmful, and the baby will outgrow it.Premature and sick babies also may stop breathing for 15 to 20 seconds or more. This interruption in breathing is called apnea. It may be accompanied by a slow heart rate called bradycardia. Babies in the NICU are constantly monitored for apnea and bradycardia (often called ""A's and B's"").Sensors on the baby's chest send information about his breathing and heart rate to a machine located near the incubator. If a baby stops breathing, an alarm will begin beeping.A nurse will stimulate the baby to start breathing by patting him or touching the soles of his feet. The neonatologist might consider giving the baby medicine or using equipment, such as continuous positive airway pressure (C-PAP), which is delivering air to a baby's lungs through either small tubes in the baby's nose or through a tube inserted into the windpipe).Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD): This chronic lung disease is most common in premature babies who have been treated for respiratory distress syndrome (RDS).Babies with RDS have immature lungs. They sometimes need a mechanical ventilator to help them breathe. Some babies treated for RDS may develop symptoms of BPD, including fluid in the lungs, scarring, and lung damage.Babies with BPD are treated with medications to make breathing easier. They're slowly weaned from the ventilator. Their lungs usually improve over the first two years of life, but some children develop a chronic lung disease resembling asthma.BPD also occasionally occurs in full-term newborns after they've had pneumonia or other infections.Persistent pulmonary hypertension of the newborn (PPHN): Babies with PPHN cannot breathe properly because they have high blood pressure in their lungs. At birth, the blood vessels in the lungs normally relax in response to the first minutes of breathing air and allow blood to flow through them. This is how the blood picks up oxygen.In babies with PPHN, this response doesn't occur. This leads to a lack of oxygen in the blood, and sometimes to other complications including brain damage. Babies with PPHN often have birth defects (such as heart defects) or have suffered from birth complications.Babies with PPHN often need a ventilator (respirator) to help them breathe. They may be given a gas called nitric oxide through a tube in the windpipe. This treatment may help the blood vessels in the lungs relax and improve breathing.Pneumonia: This lung infection is common in premature and sick newborns. A baby's doctors may suspect pneumonia if the baby has difficulty breathing, if his rate of breathing changes, if blood tests happen to show low oxygen levels, or if the baby has an increased number of apnea episodes.The doctor listens to the baby's lungs with a stethoscope and then does an X-ray to see if there's excess fluid in the lungs.Sometimes the doctor may insert a tube into the lungs to take a sample of the lung fluid. The fluid is then tested to see what type of bacterium or virus is causing the infection, so that the doctor can choose the most effective drug to treat it.Babies with pneumonia are generally treated with antibiotics. They also may need additional oxygen until the infection clears up.Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS): Babies born before 34 weeks of pregnancy often develop this serious breathing problem. RDS is sometimes called hyaline membrane disease.Babies with RDS lack a chemical mixture called surfactant, which keeps the small air sacs in the lungs from collapsing. Treatment with surfactant helps affected babies breathe more easily.Babies with RDS also may receive a treatment called continuous positive airway pressure (C-PAP). The air may be delivered through small tubes inserted into the baby's nose or windpipe.As with surfactant treatment, C-PAP helps keep small air sacs from collapsing. C-PAP helps your baby breathe, but does not breathe for him. The sickest babies may temporarily need to be put on a ventilator while their lungs recover. Congenital heart defectsThese heart defects are present at birth. They originate in the early part of pregnancy when the heart is forming.Bradycardia: Premature babies sometimes do not breathe regularly. Interrupted breathing, also called apnea, can cause bradycardia. This is an unhealthy, slow heart rate.When they occur together, NICU staff call apnea and bradycardia ""A's and B's."" Treatments include medicines and breathing support.Coarctation of the aorta: The aorta is the large artery that sends blood from the heart to the rest of the body. In this condition, the aorta may be too narrow for the blood to flow evenly.A surgeon can cut away the narrow part and sew the open ends together, replace the constricted section with manmade material, or patch it with part of a blood vessel taken from elsewhere in the body. Sometimes, this narrowed area can be widened by inflating a balloon on the tip of a catheter inserted through an artery.Heart valve abnormalities: Some babies are born with heart valves that are narrowed, closed, or blocked, and this condition prevents blood from flowing smoothly. Some babies may need to have a shunt (artificial graft) placed to allow blood to bypass the blockage until the baby is big enough to have the valve repaired or replaced.Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA): PDA is the most common heart problem in premature babies. Before birth, much of a fetus's blood goes through a passageway (ductus arteriosus) from one blood vessel to another, instead of through the lungs. This is because the lungs aren't yet in use.This passageway should close soon after birth, so the blood can take the normal route from heart to lungs and back. If it doesn't close, blood doesn't flow correctly. In some cases, drug treatment can help close the passageway. If that doesn't work, surgery can also close it.Septal defects: A septal defect refers to a hole in the wall (septum) that divides the two upper or lower chambers of the heart. Because of this hole, the blood cannot circulate as it should, and the heart has to work extra hard.A surgeon can close the hole by sewing or patching it. Small holes may heal by themselves and may not need repair at all.Tetralogy of Fallot: In this condition, a combination of four heart defects keeps some blood from getting to the lungs. As a result, a baby's skin can sometimes look blue from a lack of oxygen (cyanosis), and he may grow poorly. New surgical techniques allow this complex heart defect to be repaired early in life.Transposition of the great arteries: In this condition, the positions of the two major arteries leaving the heart are reversed. Each artery arises from the wrong pumping chamber. Surgical advances have enabled correction of this defect in the newborn period.Feeding issuesExperts agree that breast milk provides many wonderful and vital health benefits for newborns, especially premature or sick babies. A baby needs good nutrition to grow and become stronger. But he may need to be fed a different way for a while, before he is ready for the breast or a bottle.Babies who are very small or sick are often fed through a vein (intravenously). A tiny needle is placed in a vein in the baby's hand, foot, scalp, or belly button. He'll receive sugar (glucose) and essential nutrients through the vein.As soon as the baby is strong enough, he'll be fed breast milk or formula through a tube placed through the nose or mouth into the stomach or intestines. This is called gavage feeding.In gavage feeding, the tube may be left in place or inserted at each feeding. Inserting the tube shouldn't bother the baby too much because babies this small generally don't gag.When the baby can suck and swallow effectively, gavage feedings will be stopped, and the baby will be able to breastfeed or bottle-feed.Many babies in NICUs start trophic (minimal) feeds shortly after birth. This is done to stimulate the baby's intestine until he's strong enough to tolerate larger feedings.Find out more about feeding your baby in the NICU. GastroschisisThis is a birth defect of the abdominal wall. The baby's intestines, and sometimes other organs, are outside of the baby's abdomen. Surgery is done to put the baby's organs back in place and close the abdominal wall.HypoglycemiaHypoglycemia is low blood sugar (glucose). It's usually diagnosed in a baby shortly after birth.Babies born to mothers with diabetes have their glucose levels checked regularly to assess for hypoglycemia. Early feeding and an intravenous glucose solution help to prevent and treat hypoglycemia.Inability to control body heatBabies who are born too small and too soon often have trouble controlling their body temperature. Unlike healthy, full-term babies, they don't have enough fat to prevent the loss of heat from their body.Babies in the NICU are placed in an incubator or warmer right after birth to help control their temperature. A tiny thermometer taped to the baby's stomach senses his body temperature and regulates the heat in the incubator. A baby will grow faster if he maintains a normal body temperature (98.6 degrees F.).Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR)A baby with this condition grows more slowly than usual in utero, and is smaller than normal for his gestational age at birth.IUGR is ordinarily diagnosed during pregnancy through an ultrasound. It usually is due to fetal or maternal complications. Upon admission to the NICU, babies are tested to determine possible causes, although this isn't always able to be determined.Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)IVH refers to bleeding in the brain and is most common in the smallest premature babies (those weighing less than 3 1/3 pounds). The bleeds usually occur in the first four days of life.Bleeding generally occurs near the fluid-filled spaces (ventricles) in the center of the brain. An ultrasound examination can show whether a baby has had a brain bleed and how severe it is.Brain bleeds are usually given a number from 1 to 4, with 4 being the most severe. Most brain bleeds are mild (grades 1 and 2) and resolve themselves with no or few lasting problems.More severe bleeds can cause difficulties for the baby during the hospitalization and possible complications in the future. Some will require careful monitoring of the baby's development throughout infancy and childhood.JaundiceBabies with jaundice have a yellowish color to their skin and eyes. Jaundice occurs when the liver is too immature or sick to remove a waste product called bilirubin from the blood.Bilirubin is formed when old red blood cells break down. Jaundice is especially common in premature babies and in babies who have blood type incompatibilities with their mothers (such as Rh disease, ABO incompatibility, or G6PD disease).Jaundice itself doesn't usually cause harm to a baby. But a very high bilirubin level can result in more serious problems, especially for premature babies.For this reason, the baby's bilirubin level is checked frequently. If it gets too high, he's treated with special blue lights (phototherapy) that help the body break down and eliminate bilirubin.Occasionally, a baby will need a special type of blood transfusion called an exchange transfusion to reduce very high bilirubin levels. In this procedure, some of the baby's blood is removed and replaced with blood from a donor. MacrosomiaA condition in which a baby is born with excessive birth weight, that is, 4,500 grams (9 pounds, 14 ounces) or more. This is commonly due to maternal diabetes and may require delivery by cesarean section. These babies are also monitored for hypoglycemia.Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)This potentially dangerous intestinal problem most commonly affects premature babies. The bowel may become damaged when its blood supply is decreased. Bacteria that are normally present in the bowel invade the damaged area, causing more damage.Babies with NEC develop feeding problems, abdominal swelling, and other complications. If tests show that a baby has NEC, he'll be fed intravenously while his bowel heals. Sometimes damaged sections of intestine must be surgically removed.Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)ROP is an abnormal growth of blood vessels in the eye. It occurs most often in babies born before 30 weeks of pregnancy.ROP can lead to bleeding and scarring that can damage the eye's retina (the lining at the rear of the eye that relays messages to the brain). This can result in vision loss.An ophthalmologist (eye doctor) can examine the baby's eyes for signs of ROP.Most mild cases heal without treatment, with little or no vision loss. In more severe cases, the ophthalmologist may perform laser therapy or do a procedure called cryotherapy (freezing) to eliminate abnormal blood vessels and scars. Both treatments help protect the retina.SepsisSome babies are admitted to the NICU to determine whether they have this potentially dangerous infection of the bloodstream. The infection is caused by a germ that the baby has had difficulty fighting off.Certain lab tests, cultures, and X-rays can help diagnose this condition. These tests may be recommended if your baby has symptoms such as temperature instability, high or low blood sugar levels, breathing problems, or low blood pressure.The condition is treated with antibiotics, and the baby is monitored closely for an improvement in symptoms.Video: Preemies in the NICUSee what happens in the neonatal intensive care unit and how the littlest babies are treated.

7 signs of a good doctor,https://www.babycenter.com/0_7-signs-of-a-good-doctor_10341017.bc,"What makes a ""good"" doctor? If you haven't given the matter much thought, you're not alone. Most people spend more time shopping for a new car than they do selecting a physician, according to surgeon George LeMaitre, author of the book How to Choose a Good Doctor.But when you're pregnant, trying to conceive, or caring for a young child, the issue becomes more pressing. How do you measure quality, what experience is important, and how do you recognize a good doctor when you see one? After consulting with experts, we came up with a list of seven key things to look for:A caring, sincere, and empathetic attitudeBedside manner isn't everything, but it's important to find a physician you trust and feel comfortable with. In the case of your child's doctor, your child needs to feel comfortable too.At first glance, caring and empathy may seem less important than top-notch medical credentials or professional affiliations. But a doctor who genuinely cares about your well-being and your child's is more likely to pay attention to symptoms and to keep investigating if a particular treatment isn't working.As LeMaitre says, ""If you're looking for a good physician, start by looking for a human being who cares about people.""A warm, attentive manner can also make a big difference in seeing you through challenging situations  like when you're giving birth or if your child is hurt.Your child's doctor should have a repertoire of techniques to soothe a baby, distract a squirmy toddler, or calm a nervous school-age child. Good pediatricians and family doctors know how to comfort and reassure children by getting down on their level and explaining procedures in an age-appropriate way.Guide to Firsts: Doctor visitPrepare for your baby's doctor visit with our handy checklist.""Even when my kids were really little, our pediatrician talked calmly to them and told them exactly what he was doing,"" says one BabyCenter mom. ""They don't look forward to going to the doctor, but they certainly feel comfortable there.""Studies show that having a warm and accessible doctor not only makes you a more satisfied patient, it also has another important benefit: ""When patients trust their physician, they are more likely to adhere to treatment plans and follow advice,"" writes physician Manoj Pawar in Family Practice Management. And that's good news for your whole family. An open and responsive mannerA good doctor is willing to listen and take the time to answer and respond to your questions and concerns.Listening isn't just a matter of courtesy. You want your doctor to be good at diagnosing disease, ""and to do that she has to listen carefully to what you have to say,"" says San Francisco Bay Area pediatrician Laurel Schultz. ""I spend only about 10 percent of my time as a diagnostician, but it's probably the most critical part of my job.""It's also key to find a doctor who is responsive to your wishes concerning your care. If you're pregnant, that means finding a physician or midwife who will help you have the birth experience you want.""I do a lot of preconception counseling appointments. It's important to sit down and talk about what's important to you,"" says ob-gyn William Barth Jr., chief of the maternal-fetal medicine division at Massachusetts General Hospital.When you're considering a pediatric practice, find out whether the doctor shares  or at least respects  your views on feeding, sleep, vaccines, and other issues. One BabyCenter mom says her pediatrician took such a rigid stand against co-sleeping that she ended up keeping her family's sleeping arrangements a secret from him.""He was so opposed that I never raised the issue again. His narrow-mindedness on the subject made me question his other advice as well,"" she says. Ultimately she switched doctors. How to give your child medicine safely and effectivelyLearn five keys to giving your child medication safely and effectively, along with important cautions and parents' most common mistake.Knowledge  and the ability to share itA good doctor doesn't just respond to the immediate health issue that brought the patient in the door, but considers the bigger picture of that patient's overall health and how to maintain and improve it. To do this, your provider has to be informed about the latest medical research in his or her field.Knowledge by itself is not enough, of course. Good doctors are able and willing to communicate that knowledge in language you can understand, not medical jargon.Your doctor and your child's doctor should offer a wide range of information, including nutrition tips, preventive measures you can take to keep yourself and your family healthy, and updates on recent medical advances. Your pregnancy caregiver should make sure you understand the steps to a healthy pregnancy, as well as practical advice like how to recognize the signs of labor and pregnancy symptoms that can signal a problem.If you're a new parent, your baby's doctor will be a key source of information on breastfeeding, formula feeding, introducing solid food, vaccines, developmental milestones, and more.""Educating parents is an important part of a pediatrician's job,"" says Jennifer Shu, an Atlanta pediatrician and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics.""Parents aren't necessarily going to know what questions to ask, so it's important to provide 'anticipatory guidance.' That is, to offer information ahead of time about health and developmental issues that are likely to come up,"" says Shu. A good reputationYour doctor should come highly recommended  and not just by your best friend. Most people choose their doctors based on word of mouth. That's fine, but try to consult a range of people so you'll have a choice and a basis of comparison.""When people move to a new community, I advise them to ask everyone they meet for the name of their doctor. See which names keep coming up,"" says Bay Area pediatrician Schultz.When it comes to specialists, it's a good idea to ask your primary care doctor and any other doctors you know for recommendations.You'll find plenty of doctor ratings online, too. Don't choose or reject a physician based solely on one or two reviews, but do pay attention to feedback that's consistently positive or negative.To learn whether a doctor has committed a serious error or breach of ethics, get in touch with your state medical board. Look for contact information at the Federation of State Medical Boards website.Available, easy to reachA good doctor has regular office hours and clear, consistent guidelines for getting medical advice and help during nights and weekends. Your doctor  or a representative, if your doctor is unavailable  should return your phone calls promptly. This will make your life much easier!When choosing a doctor for your baby, find out whether it's easy to make and change appointments (life with a baby can be unpredictable). Make sure you understand the cancellation policy, too. Many offices charge a fee if you don't give enough notice that you can't make an appointment. Also ask whether the office saves a few slots every day for urgent care appointments, so you'll know your child can be seen right away if necessary.If you're choosing a doctor or midwife to deliver your baby, find out how the practice handles labor and delivery, whether you're likely to be delivered by someone else in the practice depending on who's on call, where you will deliver, and what will happen in case of an emergency.Finally, remember that the quality of your doctor's office staff is essential.""I have a wonderful nurse assigned to me, and in many ways she's more responsible than I am for the nature of patients' experience. She keeps me on time. She spends time with patients and answers many of their questions. She is their glue in an otherwise sophisticated and intimidating system,"" says Barth, the Massachusetts ob-gyn.Respect for your timeWhen considering a doctor for your baby or an ob-gyn, ask how long, on average, patients have to wait when they come in for an appointment. Keep in mind that having a doctor who respects your time doesn't mean you'll never have to wait.""I treat every patient as a unique case, and I take as much time as I need to provide the best possible care,"" says Shultz. ""If there's a child with abdominal pain or a teenager threatening suicide, I'm going to spend the time it takes, and I'm not watching the clock. If this means that sometimes my patients have to wait because another patient is having an emergency, I hope they realize that I'll do the same for their child in a heartbeat.""That said, even on the busiest days office staff shouldn't put you on hold indefinitely when you call, and they should keep you informed about how long you'll have to wait for your appointment. Solid credentials and affiliationsEven the worst doctors can have fancy diplomas and impressive credentials, so don't base your choice on these alone. ""A doctor could be the brightest person from the lamest school, or the lamest person from the most difficult school. I know many excellent physicians who graduated from schools I've never heard of,"" says Schultz.Still, certain credentials are must-haves. Proceed with caution if your doctor doesn't have them.Credentials to look forFirst, all doctors are required to meet state licensure requirements, which vary somewhat from state to state.Most physicians are board certified. This isn't a guarantee of competence, but it is an important seal of approval. Unless a doctor is fresh out of medical school and hasn't taken board exams yet, not being board certified is a warning sign that something's not right.Consider hospital affiliationMake sure you know which hospital your doctor is affiliated with. You'll want a hospital that's conveniently located and has a good reputation, since that's where you'll go to have your baby or if you or a family member needs to be hospitalized.Avoid doctors who have no hospital affiliation or are affiliated with a hospital that has bad ratings. (You can research the hospital by checking online sources and asking friends and acquaintances.)If you'll be delivering your baby at the hospital, ask moms you know about their experience with the labor and delivery nurses. As ob-gyn Barth points out, ""When you have your baby, the labor and delivery nurses will be with you far more than the doctor will. I come by and see how things are going every hour or so, but the nurses are there the entire time, and they have a lot to do with the quality of your experience.""A group or solo practice?Another thing to consider is whether your doctor or your child's doctor is part of a group. Schultz says that being part of a group practice is helpful for doctors and patients alike. ""We talk about cases, ask questions, puzzle things through together,"" she says of herself and her colleagues. ""Our patients get the benefit of our collective experience and knowledge."" For patients, a group practice also offers more flexibility, for instance if you need to see a doctor on your regular doctor's day off.More informationHow to break up with your doctor"
Real mom tips for saving money,https://www.babycenter.com/0_real-mom-tips-for-saving-money_10409454.bc,"The best budget tips come from your friends  even friends you havent met. We reached into the BabyCenter community and pulled out these tried-and-true tips for everything from saving on food and utilities to putting away cash for college.Build up your savingsI commit $250 per month to savings and only touch it if absolutely necessary. The only way it worked was I considered it a bill and would move the $250 as soon as we got paid, and did the rest of the budget after. It was hard at first, but it's gotten easier. -Cross4AllMany people think you need to have money to even start talking with a financial adviser. You don't. It has helped us navigate finances tremendously, and as we have progressed financially, our adviser helped us find the right ways to put aside money. Now we have money pulled automatically into investments so we don't even count that as money coming in. -Irishgirl911the2ndHave money withdrawn from the paycheck(s) go directly into savings. I have a savings account with no checks or debit card and at a different bank than we use day to day. If we get a raise, I try to put more in that savings. Because I have to physically go to the bank, I rarely touch the savings. -MomOnTheClockTry Dave Ramsey's envelope system.You take your budget and divide it up into envelopes. Once the money in that envelope is totally gone, that's it. No more money is to be spent on that category. So if you budget $100 to eat for two weeks and spend $98 in the first week, you only have $2 in that envelope for the next week. It forces you to stick to the budget.-thepotters4Stop being impulsive. Easier said than done, but plan meals, plan daily expenditures, plan for one day to eat out a month. Stick to it. Direct your comfort to the amount in your savings account, not instant gratification from spending spontaneously. -leeL0uFind out where you are spending and then create a budget. Don't try to make it too tight or you will lose it. That is, give yourself blow money and don't feel bad using it but don't just spend willy-nilly.Also look for any income-improvement opportunities. So often we just focus on cutting spending, but that is only half the picture. If you are a SAHM, can you look after another child or work part-time? Are you being paid market rates if youre working? Have a look around. -polarbearmamaaSaving vs. Spending (Mom Confidential) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:16Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:16Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosFind smart ways to scrimpWhen it comes to home goods, I try to make do or mend. I don't buy holiday decorations, but I really wanted a wreath for my front door. I called a friend who had a hedge of evergreens in her yard and made one for myself and one for her (as a thank-you). leeannhuberLook into your health-insurance company's Rx-by-mail program. They usually have the lower rates than commercial pharmacies. Added bonus, it comes to your door. No trip to pick up your Rx and then spend money because you are out and about, or in a pinch because it's one more thing to do and you spend out of convenience.-sparksmommaI stay off Pinterest. Pinterest tempts me try new recipes and buy organizing gadgets and craft supplies. I save so much when I'm too busy to go in there. -IndigorainWalk, bike, and use public transportation as much as possible. -sparksmommaIf you think you ""need"" something, first look around for something you can use as a substitute, at least temporarily (rags for paper towels, cardboard boxes for laundry baskets). If you find something, great! If not, maybe it's something you can borrow from a neighbor (tool you won't use often?).If you still need to buy, start looking for the cheapest way to do so. Hopefully, a substitute has bought you time to look for used, wait for a sale, watch for coupons, or arrange with a friend to go halfsies. Your creativity may also help you find a cheaper substitute. -myla's_tribeTransportation: We share a car. I take my husband into work on Friday and run all our errands/appointments on that day. It takes a bit of planning, but it works. This cuts car payments, insurance payments, and gas. Also where I live, Sam's Club has the cheapest gas, and that saves a ton, too. -2tmommy12Cut the utilities billCell phones: Shop the cheapest plans with appropriate coverage in your area.-2tmommy12We use drying racks for a lot of our laundry. Keeps the gas bill lower and extends the life of the clothing.-sparksmommaSave canning/baking for cold days. Open the drapes to let in sun during the warm part of the day. Add extra built-ins/cabinets/quilt artwork on exterior walls as an extra insulated layer.Sleep in a smaller room so theres less to heat. Wear a second set of wool socks. Set your thermostat at 50 degrees when traveling, as the air warms up in just minutes when getting home. Add humidity. It makes the rooms feel warmer. -ts07404Save on food shoppingAnalyze your receipt. Look at what you are spending on what. Are there things you can cut like juice, Coke, chips, and snacks? Can you cut back on meats and do a meat-free night once a week? Also, are you using everything you buy? If you are throwing out produce, leftovers, or stale snacks, that's wasted money. So watch what is going into the trash. Make plans for or freeze leftovers and produce that is getting too ripe. TexasSugarI find that planning better helps us save money. Meal planning (and knowing what we have on hand) ensures that we are less tempted to go out to eat. -tootsieroll1978Ask/look at your local grocery store for Manager Specials.Mine offersone shelf in the meat dept., one for bread, etc. When I find buttermilk for $1.50, salmon half-price, or the extra-fancy bread for $1, it makes me happy. Note: you might also ask in each department what time of day they put things on the specials shelf, so you can plan your shopping at that time. JGHRWhen using coupons, only buy types of products you normally would use. If a different brand of toilet paper is cheaper, that's great ... but don't start buying canned chili or Hamburger Helper just because it's on sale if no one in your family will eat it! (It's tempting sometimes when you find a great deal.) JGHRI noticed that the more trips I make to the market, the more I spent. Limit your trips (also save on gas), and you are less likely to buy things you don't need. Keep track of what you buy to see whether you can find alternatives or make them at home cheaper or buy in bulk. -swttea2I allow myself small splurges. For example, even though I know frozen pizza isn't the best nutrition-wise, spending $10 on frozen pizza saves me from spending $35 on pizza delivery. Spending $4 on bagged salad at the grocery store saves me from going to a restaurant and spending $10 on a salad for lunch. WalkingInTheWoodsSave on clothes shoppingI go to the Goodwill, where they sell clothing by the pound. It really is helping us clothe our baby at an affordable price. -DanaNewNovemberI used to have a bit of a clothes-shopping addiction, nothing over-the-top crazy but it was making things difficult for me. Now if I feel like I need to impulse buy, I set a $5 limit. Then, if I feel like I can't find anything I really like, I don't buy anything. -IheartWes&GI love to save money by shopping at thrift stores, consignments shops, garage sales, and online auctions. I love sifting through things for great deals on brand-new or almost-brand-new items. I also love to refashion things. Thats fun for me too. My new project is to take a few men's plaid shirts from Goodwill and fit them to me so that I can do the whole plaid-and-leggings thing with boots that I scored for $3 on an auction.-shoestringmammaSocking away for collegeWe have a 529 for our little one. When he was baptized, and almost any other time he receives money, we put it in there. We also put some money in for holidays  if, say, at Christmas we planned to spend $100 on him, half goes toward gifts and the other half goes into the college fund until he's older and actually knows the difference between three gifts and ten. -Kel DCGrandparents have access to our childs savings-account number IF they want to put money in. I also have a small amount going out of my pay each pay period. That way I don't miss the money and it will accrue interest over time. -2catsnabumpOnce our mortgage is paid off and we are debt-free, we will bump up our retirement savings and start to think about college funds. Our financial planner said it best: ""Your kids can always borrow for college, but you can't borrow for retirement!"" -lablizWe haven't started saving yet, but currently pay over $18,000 per year for daycare. When our little one starts school at 5 years old, we will take the money we were using towards daycare to save for his tuition. -Kcopeland08We save whatever we get back in taxes for our sons college every year and put in extra when we can.NiaWeaverDont forget to have funWhat made a huge difference in our world was when we decided dinner out needs to be intentional. Also, we have two or three ""emergency"" meals on hand that can be thrown together quick or tossed in the oven/microwave. We keep these on hand for busy nights where we'd be tempted to just go out or hit the drive-through. I also keep a lunch bag in the cars with assorted snacks and bottles of water. This saves us from hitting the snack bar or convenience store.Make going out an event, and save it for a good reason. -sakuraphoenixCable: Cut it. We kept internet and use Netflix and Hulu instead. In a year of doing this, I honestly don't miss cable because we never watched it anyway. Alsoif you get an antenna, you can pick up your local channels: ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX. We do this quite successfully. Your antenna will depend on your area and whether its metro or rural. -2tmommy12"
What is a high-risk pregnancy?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_what-is-a-high-risk-pregnancy_10414223.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI have a high-risk pregnancy. What does that mean?If your pregnancy is high-risk, it means you need extra care to help you have a healthy pregnancy and baby. If you're being treated for a lifelong (chronic) condition, you may have known for a long time that becoming pregnant carries additional risks. Or you may find out you have a high-risk pregnancy because of a problem that develops for the first time during pregnancy.Either way, having a high-risk pregnancy means it's more likely that you or your baby will have health problems during pregnancy, birth, or after delivery. These could be very minor problems, but in some cases, a high-risk condition can be life threatening for a woman or her baby. That's why a high-risk pregnancy requires extra monitoring by a healthcare provider.Being told that your pregnancy is high-risk can be a shock, and you're likely to feel a mix of emotions. You might find it difficult to enjoy your pregnancy because you're worried about your own health or your baby's health.Ask your provider for information about your pregnancy and how to prevent or manage problems. Building a support network, talking to your partner, family and friends, or other women in a similar situation, can help you feel better informed and more in control.It's likely you'll hear and read about many issues and complications that could affect your pregnancy. But having a high-risk pregnancy doesn't mean you won't have a healthy baby. So don't give up hope.What causes a high-risk pregnancy?Many factors can make a pregnancy high-risk.You may be considered high risk if you had problems in a previous pregnancy  if you delivered a baby early, for example. This doesn't mean you'll definitely experience the same problems again, but your provider will want to keep a closer eye on you as your pregnancy progresses.Some health conditions can make your pregnancy high-risk too. See a doctor before you start trying to get pregnant if you have a chronic condition, so you can be as healthy as possible before you conceive. There are many health conditions that affect pregnancy including:Blood disorders. If you have a blood disorder, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia, the additional strain pregnancy puts on your body can make your condition worse. There are also potential risks to your baby (both during pregnancy and after delivery) if she inherits your condition.Chronic kidney disease. This condition increases your risk of miscarriage, developing high blood pressure and preeclampsia, and having your baby early. Pregnancy can also put an extra strain on your kidneys.Depression. Pregnancy and becoming a mom can make you more vulnerable to mental health problems, including anxiety and depression. Untreated depression and some medications for depression are linked with risks for your baby. (However, don't make changes to your medication without talking to your healthcare provider first. Stopping suddenly has risks too.)High blood pressure. You can still have a normal pregnancy, even if you have high blood pressure. However, untreated high blood pressure can cause your baby to grow more slowly than usual or be born early. Other complications associated with high blood pressure include preeclampsia and placental abruption, a serious condition in which the placenta partially or completely separates from the uterus before a baby is born.HIV or AIDS. If you have HIV or AIDS, your baby can become infected before birth, during delivery, or when you breastfeed. Fortunately, medication can dramatically reduce this risk.Lupus. Lupus and other autoimmune diseases can increase your risk of preterm delivery, preeclampsia, and having a small baby. Being pregnant may also increase the likelihood of your disease flaring up or getting worse.Maternal age. Your age can affect how likely you are to have a high-risk pregnancy. Being an older mom (age 35 or older in your first pregnancy) or a younger one (in your teens) puts you at greater risk of some complications and health problems.Obesity. Having a body mass index (BMI) of 30 or higher before pregnancy puts you at greater risk of gestational diabetes, type 2 diabetes, and high blood pressure during your pregnancy. When it comes to giving birth, you're more likely to need your labor induced or a cesarean delivery.Thyroid disease. Both an underactive thyroid (hypothyroidism) and an overactive thyroid (hyperthyroidism) during pregnancy can cause problems for you and your baby if the condition isn't controlled. These problems can include miscarriage, preeclampsia, low birth weight, and having your baby early.Type 1 or type 2 diabetes. If your diabetes isn't managed well, you could be at risk of complications including birth defects, high blood pressure, having your baby early, and having a very big baby (macrosomia). Your baby may have problems with breathing, low glucose levels, and jaundice.Addiction to cigarettes, alcohol, or drugs will increase your risk of pregnancy problems. Try to be open and honest with your healthcare provider so she can help you access the support you need:Alcohol. Heavy drinking during pregnancy exposes your baby to an increased risk of stillbirth and fetal alcohol spectrum disorder (FASD).Smoking. If you smoke while you're pregnant, your baby is at risk of many complications including being born small and being born early.Substance abuse. If you use illegal drugs or misuse prescription medication regularly your baby may suffer from withdrawal symptoms after birth. He may have birth defects, have a low birth weight, or be born early.It's also possible to develop health problems for the first time during your pregnancy, even if you're usually fit and healthy. These sorts of problems include:Birth defects. About 3 in 100 babies born will have a birth defect. Some birth defects can be detected by ultrasound or by genetic testing before birth. If a birth defect is suspected or diagnosed, you and your baby will be followed more closely during pregnancy. Depending on the defect, you may also need to give birth at a hospital with pediatric specialists available to care for your baby immediately.Gestational diabetes. This is diabetes that develops during pregnancy. Gestational diabetes can be controlled by following a diet and treatment plan that may include medication, such as insulin. Uncontrolled gestational diabetes can put you at risk of a preterm birth, high blood pressure, and preeclampsia.Growth problems. Your provider will track your baby's growth by measuring your belly at each visit. In some cases, a baby doesn't grow as well as it should. If your baby's growth is too slow, you may need extra monitoring, and you may need to have your baby early.Multiples. If you're pregnant with twins or more, you'll have extra care during your pregnancy because carrying more than one baby puts a strain on your body. Your babies can be at risk of complications, especially being born early.Preeclampsia. This is a serious condition that occurs during the second half of pregnancy, in which you develop high blood pressure and protein leaks into your urine. Preeclampsia can slow down the rate of your baby's growth and affect your health. Giving birth is the only cure for preeclampsia, so if you develop this condition you may need to have your baby early.How does being high risk affect my care?If you have a high-risk pregnancy, you may need more frequent prenatal appointments and will be monitored closely by your providers. You may also be referred to a maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) doctor. This is a physician who is specially trained to care for women who have a high-risk pregnancy.The exact care you and your baby need depends on your particular circumstances and on the reasons your pregnancy is high-risk. You might see your MFM doctor just once or regularly throughout your pregnancy. Your MFM doctor will work with your ob-gyn and other providers to keep you and your baby healthy as your pregnancy progresses.How does being high-risk affect my labor?It's worth preparing yourself for the idea that the birth you have may not be the birth you'd choose. If your pregnancy is high-risk, you won't have the option of a home birth or attending a birth center. You'll need to give birth in a hospital where you and your baby can be monitored closely and specialist care is available during the birth and afterward.If you're having multiples, you're more likely to go into labor early. Preterm labor is also more likely if you have a high-risk pregnancy for other reasons, such as having too much amniotic fluid around the baby or having certain medical conditions.You may also need to have your labor induced to prevent or reduce health problems for you and your baby. Or there may be reasons why a vaginal birth isn't possible and you need to have a c-section.Talk to your provider about what you can expect during labor, so you can prepare yourself in the best way possible.Will my baby be okay if I'm high-risk?If you have a high-risk pregnancy, one of your biggest worries will probably be whether any harm will come to your baby. It's natural to be concerned.However, with good prenatal care it's possible to have a healthy baby. Healthy moms grow healthy babies: That's why it's so important to talk to your provider to find out how best to keep you and your baby safe.Some conditions, as well as the drugs that are usually prescribed to manage them, pose a risk to your baby's health. But stopping medications that you take for a condition can also be very dangerous.You may be asked to change the drugs you take for a health condition, such as high blood pressure, to another medication that's safer during pregnancy. This can help to reduce the risk of problems that the side effects of your medication might cause for your baby while he's developing in the uterus. Note: Don't stop taking any medication without consulting your provider first.If your baby is born early, he could have difficulty breathing or feeding, or develop infections or other complications. If this happens, he needs extra care and support, which means staying in the hospital for several weeks, probably in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).How can I reduce the risk of pregnancy complications?There are a few things you can do to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications when you're high risk:If you're not yet pregnant, schedule a preconception visit with your healthcare provider. Aim to do this at least a few months (or more, depending on your condition) before you start trying to conceive. This gives you time to make any changes your provider recommends before you become pregnant.Find out all you can about your condition and what you can do to stay healthy. Ask your provider for information.At your first prenatal visit, tell your provider about any current health problems you have, any medication you're taking, and any difficulties you had in previous pregnancies.Go to all your prenatal appointments and follow your healthcare provider's advice.Have a healthy lifestyle: Follow your provider's nutritional guidance, gain the right amount of weight, and stay active if you're able. Don't smoke or drink alcohol.Ask your partner, family, and friends for support  this is likely to be a stressful time.Look after your emotional well-being. Take time out for yourself and reduce your stress levels where you can.Where to go nextDoes insurance cover the cost of a high-risk pregnancy?High-risk Women Say: The inspiring ways my partner supports meHigh-risk pregnancy: ResourcesUse the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicines Find an MFM Specialist tool to locate a high-risk pregnancy doctor near you.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2011.

"BabyCenter® Reveals Profile of Today's Millennial Mom: She's Resilient, Resourceful, Optimistic",https://www.babycenter.com/0_babycenter-174-reveals-profile-of-todays-millennial-mom-shes_10415025.bc,"Contact:Jennifer Samuels / Sue MurphyCoyne Public Relations973.588.2000Millennial Moms Challenge Generational Stereotypes Key Findings Include Backlash to Helicopter Parenting and Rise of Entrepreneurs(San Francisco)  January 30, 2014  BabyCenter, the #1 pregnancy and parenting mobile and web destination worldwide, today released its Millennial Mom Report, the latest installment in BabyCenters 21st Century Mom Insights Series. BabyCenter has revealed the profile of todays newest and youngest mothers, ages 18 to 32, with insights surrounding their parenting, technology usage, and overall ambitions as both parents and individuals.The Millennial Mom is more than you think she is, says Mike Fogarty, SVP and Global Publisher at BabyCenter. She represents a cultural and economic force thats creating lasting change. Remember, this generation entered adulthood in the late 1990s with a tailwind of economic growth and global stability, only to see their future thrown into question. Millennial Moms are also bucking convention  in the way they raise their kids and the way they live their own lives.Fogarty adds, The media's coverage of this generation as self-centered and entitled misses the point. Millennials are a study in contrasts. They're underemployed but entrepreneurial, educated but in debt, digital natives fluent with technology and new media  but back to basics with a strong focus on the environment, health, and nutrition.Shes Not Her MotherMillennial Moms are the product of helicopter parenting and opt to parent their own children differently by adopting a more relaxed approach. Despite parenting pressures, Millennial Moms say their parenting style is loving (96%), encouraging (92%), supportive (90%), and involved (87%). When asked about their own upbringing, Millennial Moms are more likely than Gen X moms to say that their parents were protective (63% vs. 49%), worried (38% vs. 26%), and enabling (34% vs. 25%). However, when asked about their own parenting style, Millennial Moms say they are fun (88% vs. 82% of Gen X moms), forgiving (87% vs. 77%), relaxed (59% vs 48%), and aspirational (49% vs. 39%).Millennial Moms are clearly reacting to the way they were raised, says Fogarty. Theyre creating an environment for their kids thats more laid back and less structured, and they feel more relaxed and happy as parents. They reject the pressure they grew up with.A closer look at family dynamics shows that Millennial Moms place greater emphasis on being a good parent and less emphasis on having a successful marriage. A Pew Research Center report on Millennials overall found that 52% say being a good parent is one of the most important things in life (24% higher than Gen X) while only 30% say the same about having a successful marriage (14% lower than Gen X).Millennial Moms  and dads too, for that matter  are placing a higher importance on parenting than previous generations, says Fogarty. But they also wont give up the individuality thats a hallmark of Millennials. The result is a highly integrated life, where we time is best served with regular doses of me time.Shes Digitally ConnectedMillennial Moms spend an average of 8.3 hours daily consuming media  about an hour more per day than Gen X moms  with most of that extra time spent streaming video or going online using a smartphone or tablet. According to the study, the Millennial Mom toolkit includes laptops (83%), smartphones (81%), and streaming TV subscriptions (53%). Additionally, Millennial Moms have a preference for all portable devices compared to Gen Xers.The report also uncovered that although Millennial and Gen X moms use both smartphones and tablets, Millennial Moms are simply using them more. Compared to Gen X, Millennial Moms are 5% more likely to use social media on their mobile devices on a daily basis. In addition, they are 20% more likely to take/share photos or video, 37% more likely to listen to music, and 145% more likely to watch online videos and movies on their mobile device daily.As digital natives, Millennial Moms are very comfortable using technology, including apps, to manage their lives and get more accomplished in less time. These moms turn to their mobile devices to look up recipes (76%), manage finances (69%), and search for parenting advice (76%) monthly. The study found that Millennial Moms top five favorite apps are Facebook, Instagram, BabyCenter, Pinterest, and Pandora.Millennial Moms are also socially nimble: They over-index against Gen X moms across all social media platforms and are more likely to experiment with emerging social networks. Compared to Gen X, Millennial Moms are 30% more likely to have used Tumblr, 167% more likely to have used Vine, and over three times as likely to have used Snapchat.Shes Socially SelectiveDespite increased social media activity, Millennial Moms are less concerned about posting pictures of themselves or their children to social networks. This may be due to the fact that they are more tech-savvy and know how to take security precautions. Four out of five Millennial Moms dont settle for Facebooks default privacy settings and three out of five turn off location services for photos and/or social media sites.Millennial Moms are also happy to communicate with others digitally. Compared to Gen X moms, Millennial Moms are twice as likely to prefer communicating with their parents via text, and twice as likely to use social media to send birthday party invitations. In addition, Millennial Moms are 21% less likely to send a thank-you note via postal mail.Social norms change over time, says Robi Ludwig, psychotherapist and BabyCenter contributor. While older generations may interpret some newer communication methods as impersonal, younger generations see them as a natural progression of how we communicate in the digital era.Shes an EntrepreneurThe average Millennial Mom entered adulthood after Apple released the iPhone and after the introduction of social media, eBay, and Etsy. She is fearless, creative, and ambitious with radically different career expectations.According to Entrepreneur, more than half report wanting to start their own business. BabyCenter found that compared to Gen X moms, Millennial Moms are 17% more likely to freelance, and one in five have started a blog with substantial followers. Thirty-nine percent of Millennial Moms have used social media to sell items theyve made (63% higher than Gen X moms). Millennial Moms are also 67% more likely than Gen X moms to have received payment for running errands or helping others, using apps like TaskRabbit and GigWalk.Despite the unstable economy and high unemployment rates, Millennial Moms have a can-do attitude, says Fogarty. Its clear from our research that these moms feel confident in their ability to make ends meet, but what is surprising is how much technology plays into this. From getting paid for making store visits and posting reviews, to leveraging social media to promote freelance work or a home business, Millennials are using the new digital tools at their disposal to deliver in very new ways for their family. A few years ago, we saw moms embrace the online couponing trend, but now were seeing a dramatic shift. Moms arent just saving money; theyre finding creative ways to earn it.For more information on the 2014 Millennial Mom Report, please visit http://www.babycentersolutions.com.###MethodologyFor the 2014 Millennial Mom Report, BabyCenter partnered with Research Now to field an in-depth survey of more than 1700+ respondents including 1,353 Millennial Moms (age 18 to 32) and 359 Generation X moms (age 33 to 44) recruited from the BabyCenter 21st Century Mom Panel, part of the Research Now e-Rewards Panel, leveraged social listening tools including BabyCenters Talk Tracker to gain insights into community conversations among 11.4+ million U.S. moms, and held qualitative in-home friendship groups in Austin and Boston with moms ages 21 to 28 during November 2013 to gather insights on life as a mom today, media, technology, parenting resources, and brand preferences. BabyCenter also used third-party sources, including the United States Census, the CDC, the Pew Research Center, Weber Shandwick and KRC Research, Ciscos Connected World Technology Report, and comScore for population estimates, spending power, behaviors and attitudes.About BabyCenter LLCBabyCenter is the worlds partner in parenting.

Preeclampsia,https://www.babycenter.com/0_preeclampsia_257.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWhat is preeclampsia?Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication that causes high blood pressure, kidney damage, and other problems. Preeclampsia is a potentially life-threatening condition that affects about 5 percent of pregnant women in the United States.Preeclampsia may not cause any symptoms but can still be very dangerous to you and your baby, even if you feel fine. Your healthcare provider will screen you for the condition at every prenatal visit by taking your blood pressure, and if it's high, testing your urine for protein.Preeclampsia most commonly develops during the last trimester, but it can happen at any time in the second half of pregnancy, during labor, or even up to six weeks after delivery. It can become severe very quickly or progress slowly. Left untreated, it can lead to dangerous health problems for you and your baby, such as HELLP syndrome and eclampsia.(See below.)How can preeclampsia affect me and my baby?Most women who get preeclampsia develop it near their due date and do fine with proper care. But the earlier you develop the condition, and the more severe it is, the greater the risks for you and your baby because preeclampsia always significantly raises the chance of serious complications.Severe preeclampsia can affect many organs and cause serious, or even life-threatening, problems. That's why some women may need to deliver early if the condition is severe or getting worse.Weight gain and pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:25Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:25Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosPreeclampsia causes the blood vessels to constrict, resulting in high blood pressure and a reduced blood flow that can affect organs in the body, including the liver, kidneys, and brain. These changes can cause small blood vessels to ""leak"" fluid into tissues, resulting in swelling (edema). And when these tiny blood vessels in the kidneys leak, protein from the bloodstream spills into urine. (It's normal to have a small amount of protein in your urine, but more than a little bit can signal a problem.)When less blood flows to the uterus, it can cause problems for a baby, such aspoor growth,too little amniotic fluid, andplacental abruption(when the placenta separates from the uterine wall before delivery). In addition, a baby may suffer the effects ofprematurityif early delivery is needed to protect the mother's health and prevent stillbirth.Preeclampsia symptomsPreeclampsia doesn't always cause noticeable symptoms, especially in the early stages, and symptoms can also vary from woman to woman. Some symptoms of preeclampsia, such as swelling, nausea, and weight gain, may seem like normal pregnancy complaints, so it's important to be aware of any potential warning signs.Unusual swelling is the most common one, so call your healthcare provider if you:Notice swelling in your face or puffiness around your eyesHave more than slight swelling in your handsHave sudden or excessive swelling of your feet or anklesGain more than 4 pounds in a week (This often results from water retention.)Note: Not all women with preeclampsia have obvious swelling or dramatic weight gain, and not all women with swelling or rapid weight gain have preeclampsia.Pregnancy swelling (edema) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:50Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:50Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Get tips for prevention and when to call your doctor. See all pregnancy videosCall your provider immediately if you haveanyof these other warning signs of severe preeclampsia:Severe or persistent headacheVision changes, including double vision, blurriness, seeing spots or flashing lights, light sensitivity, or temporary vision lossIntense pain or tenderness in your upper abdomenNausea and vomiting (in the second or third trimester)Difficulty breathingHow is preeclampsia diagnosed?Your healthcare provider will check your blood pressure and urine. You'll get a diagnosis of preeclampsia if your blood pressure is elevated and you have protein in your urine. Even if you don't have protein in your urine, an elevated blood pressure reading may prompt your provider to order more lab tests.High blood pressureYour blood pressure is considered high if you have a systolic reading of 140 or greater (the upper number) or a diastolic reading of 90 or higher (the lower number). Because blood pressure can fluctuate during the day, you'll have more than one reading to confirm that it's consistently high.Protein in urineYour provider will also test a urine sample for protein. If this initial screening shows there's protein in your urine, you may be asked to collect all your urine for 24 hours so it can be tested over time. This is the most accurate test for protein. A result of 300 milligrams (mg) of protein in a 24-hour urine sample is a sign of preeclampsia.Protein-creatinine ratioAnother urine test for preeclampsia is called the protein-creatinine ratio. (Creatinine is a waste product that your kidneys should filter out.)This test uses one random sample, so it's easier to do than the 24-hour urine test, and it's sometimes given as a substitute. If the result of your protein-creatinine ratio test is at least 0.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL), it could be a sign of preeclampsia.What is HELLP syndrome?Some women with preeclampsia develop a life-threatening condition called HELLP syndrome. HELLP stands for:Hemolysis, the breakdown of red blood cellsElevatedliver enzymesLowplatelets, the blood cells that are necessary for clottingHELLP syndrome can happen before delivery or postpartum, and puts you and your baby at an even higher risk for the problems that can result from severe preeclampsia alone. Once you develop preeclampsia, your blood will be tested periodically for signs of HELLP syndrome.What is eclampsia?In rare situations, preeclampsia can lead to seizures, a condition called eclampsia. Eclampsia can be life-threatening for both you and your baby.The seizures may be preceded by symptoms such as:Severe or persistent headacheVision changes, including blurred vision, seeing spots, or sensitivity to lightMental confusionIntense upper abdominal painHowever, sometimes the seizures occur without warning, so you may be given the antiseizure medication magnesium sulfate before and after delivery.What causes preeclampsia?Experts believe that preeclampsia is caused by a reduced blood flow to the placenta, and that many cases actually begin early in pregnancy, well before any symptoms become evident. This could happen if the placenta fails to implant properly in the lining of the uterus, and the arteries in that area don't dilate as they should, meaning less blood reaches the placenta. Conditions such as chronic hypertension and diabetes can also cause reduced blood flow to the placenta.There's also evidence that changes in blood flow to the placenta trigger the release of high levels of certain placental proteins into your bloodstream. This can set off a complex chain of reactions that includes:Constricted blood vessels (leading to high blood pressure)Damage to the vessel walls (leading to swelling and protein in your urine)Reduced blood volumeChanges in blood clottingWhy this happens to some women and not others isn't fully understood, and there's probably no single explanation. Genetics, nutrition, certain underlying diseases, the way your immune system reacts to pregnancy, and other factors may all play a role.Preeclampsia risk factorsIt's more common to get preeclampsia during a first pregnancy. However, once you've had preeclampsia, you're more likely to develop it again in later pregnancies.The more severe the condition and the earlier it appears, the higher your risk. So if you had severe preeclampsia that started before 29 weeks of pregnancy, your chance of getting it again may be nearly 40 percent, or perhaps even higher. Other risk factors include:Having a family history of preeclampsiaBeing obese (having a body mass index of 30 or more)Carrying twins (or more)Being younger than 20 or older than 35Having in vitro fertilization (IVF)Certain health conditions also make it more likely you'll develop preeclampsia. These include:Chronic hypertensionorgestational hypertensionCertain blood clotting disorders, such as thrombophilia or antiphospholipid syndromeDiabetes or kidney diseaseAutoimmune diseases, such as lupusIf you're at risk for preeclampsia, your provider may schedule more frequent prenatal visits in your third trimester to monitor you closely.What is the treatment for preeclampsia?Treatment for preeclampsia depends on how severe it is, how far along you are, and how your baby's doing. You'll probably be hospitalized for an initial assessment  and possibly for the rest of your pregnancy.To find out how serious your condition is, your provider will check your blood pressure, test your urine, and do a number of blood tests. You'll also have an ultrasound to check your baby's growth, and possibly abiophysical profileandnonstress testto see how your baby's doing.If you have preeclampsia and you're at 37 weeks or more, you'll likely be induced, especially if your cervix is starting to thin out and dilate. (You'll have a c-section if there are signs that you or your baby won't be able to tolerate labor.)If you're not yet at 37 weeks, your condition appears stable, and your baby's in good condition,you probably won't need to deliver right away. You might remain in the hospital so you can be monitored. Or you might be sent home where you may have to monitor your blood pressure.Most providers will recommend restricting your activities because your blood pressure will generally be lower when you're at rest. But completebedrest, in which you're confined to bed for an extended period, raises your risk of blood clots and isn't recommended.There's no special diet you need to follow when you're on modified bedrest, and you won't need to restrict your salt intake. But don't forget you're supposed to be taking it easy. If you're generally responsible for shopping and cooking in your household, you're going to have to hand over to your partner, or get help from family and friends for the next few weeks.Whether at home or in the hospital, you and your baby will be monitored closely for the rest of your pregnancy. If you're at home, this means coming in to see your provider for frequent blood pressure checks and urine tests (and possibly blood tests), as well as periodic ultrasounds and nonstress tests. Your provider may also ask you to count the number of times your baby moves during a specific period of time(fetal kick counts).If at any time your symptoms indicate that your condition is getting worse, or that your baby isn't thriving, you'll be admitted to the hospital and will probably need to deliver. It's not unusual for preeclampsia to become more severe during delivery, so you'll be monitored very closely throughout the birth.How is severe preeclampsia treated?If you're diagnosed with severe preeclampsia,you'll have to spend the rest of your pregnancy in the hospital. You may be transferred to a hospital where a high-risk pregnancy specialistcan care for you. You'll be given medication to lower your blood pressure if it's extremely high as well as magnesium sulfate intravenously to prevent seizures.If you're at 34 weeks or later you may be induced or, in certain situations, delivered by c-section. If you're not yet 34 weeks along, you may be givencorticosteroidsto help your baby's lungs mature more quickly. If you don't deliver immediately, both you and your baby will be monitored very closely.You'll be induced or delivered by c-section at the first sign that preeclampsia is getting worse or your baby isn't thriving, regardless of where you are in your pregnancy.What if I develop preeclampsia during or after labor?If you develop preeclampsia during or after labor,you'll be monitored closely. Depending on your situation, you may be given magnesium sulfate to prevent seizures and medication to reduce your blood pressure.After delivery, you'll remain under close supervision for a few days to keep tabs on your blood pressure and to watch for signs of other complications. Most women, especially those with less severe preeclampsia, see their blood pressure start to go down in a day or so. In severe cases, it can remain elevated for longer.If your blood pressure remains high, you'll probably be given magnesium sulfate intravenously for at least 24 hours after delivery to prevent seizures. (You may also need to take blood pressure medication at home.)Sometimes cases of preeclampsia, eclampsia, and HELLP syndrome develop after delivery, usually within the first 48 hours but as late as four weeks after delivery. You'll likely have a follow-up blood pressure check within one week of discharge from the hospital, but if you start to experience any symptoms of preeclampsia or HELLP, such as a severe headache, a pain high up in your abdomen or changes to your vision, contact your healthcare provider right away.How can I prevent preeclampsia?No one knows for sure whether it's possible to prevent preeclampsia, but there's a lot of research currently being done.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommend that women at high risk for preeclampsia begin taking low-dose aspirin after 12 weeks of pregnancy.Low-dose aspirin therapy is intended to prevent preeclampsia rather than treat it. Ask your provider if you would be a candidate for aspirin therapy. Never takeaspirin during pregnancyunless your provider recommends it. And if you do develop preeclampsia, be sure to check with your provider about stopping aspirin therapy.Other than that, the best thing you can do is get good prenatal care and keep all your appointments. At each visit, your healthcare provider will check your blood pressure and may test your urine for protein. It's also important to know the warning signs of preeclampsia so you can alert your provider and start treatment as soon as possible.Find out more about preeclampsiaCall the Preeclampsia Foundation at (800) 665-9341 or visitpreeclampsia.org.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

Flawed & fabulous moms: Why great parenting isn't perfect,https://www.babycenter.com/0_flawed-fabulous-moms-why-great-parenting-isnt-perfect_1477588.bc,"""That sure was fun!"" I said to my 6-year-old daughter recently as we were leaving a birthday party at a local bowling alley.But my daughter was pouting. ""You didn't see my strike,"" she said.""Yes, I did, honey,"" I said. ""I saw all the pins go down.""""No, you didn't,"" she stomped her foot. ""You were talking to the other mommies. You didn't even look at me. All you do is talk, talk, talk.""The pang of guilt hit me hard. She was right: I was talking to the other moms when it was her turn. But I did look up just as all the pins toppled over. Was it too late?Ah, my precious kindergartner has learned how to push my buttons. And guess what? It often works.That's because I want to be a good mother. What mom doesn't?Good, better, bestA good mother. This phrase sparks enthusiasm, hope, the glow of positive intentions. After all, we moms by our very nature are driven to do right by our kids.So what is a ""good mother""  how much flexibility have we got in there? Is there an official scorecard? Am I ""the best mom I can be""?""'Best' and 'mom' are two words that shouldn't be used in the same sentence,"" says mom-of-four Paula Spencer, author of the forthcoming book Momfidence! An Oreo Never Killed Anybody and Other Secrets of Happier Parenting (Crown/Three Rivers Press, 2006).""Raising kids isn't like trying to make a 4.0 or win a race,"" she adds.Unfortunately, in too many minds ""good mother"" means ""perfect.""""Absolutely, I feel like I have to be the perfect mom. There's a lot of pressure to have your child be exposed to as many learning and growth opportunities as possible  make them an uber child by being an uber parent,"" says Hilary Miller, account director at a marketing company in Denver, Colorado, and mother of Nicholas.""It's unrealistic to think you can work full time, spend lots of quality time with your kid, be at all the playdates, birthday parties, and sports games, cook the healthy dinners, help them with homework. But whatever you're doing, it can feel like it's still not enough,"" she adds.June Cleaver had it easyMotherhood long ago moved beyond just keeping a tidy house, cooking square meals, and giving hugs. Today's bar is high: making sure the kids are physically healthy and emotionally fulfilled, their lunchboxes and dinner plates are full of the best nutrition, their weekends busy with enriching experiences  all while we hold down anything from a part-time job to a full-time career. But being the Martha Stewart of motherhood just isn't reality for most of us.Who cooked up these crazy expectations anyway?Well, while we were napping, paparazzi photographed another dozen celebrity moms to be lauded in next week's issues. Pictures of them lovingly toting their offspring are flanked by quotes from ""anonymous friends"" about how devoted they are, how delightedly they change diapers. The celebrity herself notes how fun and fulfilling it is making organic baby food, and how motherhood is wonderful and she can't wait to have more. And all the while she manages to film movies, organize fundraisers for charitable causes, and appear on Jay Leno.Are these the new Stepford moms?Actually, the nanny was cropped out of the photograph, you can't see the bags under the celebrity's eyes thanks to her giant sunglasses, and the paparazzi missed her meltdown in the car minutes earlier when she couldn't get little baby Orchid Moonflower out of her car seat.And next week, she'll be raked over the coals for not putting baby sunscreen and a hat on Orchid for that perilous trip from the house to the car.Who asked the experts?As our society becomes more child-centered, parents feel more and more in the service of their children  and more pressured to do everything right. There's a pervasive sense of blame that tells us, no matter how your kid turns out, all his flaws point back to you: The wrong kind of discipline, the wrong foods, the wrong reading materials, even what you eat during pregnancy will affect your child. Is it any wonder we want to be ""perfect""? We want to stay off the firing range!We now know more about the long-term consequences of our parenting, and the pressure's on. Our parents didn't have Oprah and Dr. Phil to show them where they screwed up, but we do  and they're constant reminders of the risks of getting it wrong.And of course, we know that no matter what we do, somewhere years from now in a therapist's office, our child will be talking about us. A lot.But there's also a sense that modern life is competitive, expensive, and more difficult and we have to give our kids every advantage to succeed. So is it any wonder that more and more experts are weighing in on exactly the right way to parent  and we're eating it up?Thousands of parenting books are in print  just look on Amazon.com and try to count. Book titles such as Coaching Your Kids to Be Leaders: The Keys to Unlocking Their Potential, Developing Your Child's Emotional Intelligence: Self Control by Age 3 in 10 Simple Steps, and of course, How to Really Love Your Child (just in case you weren't sure) can make it seem like no matter how well you think you're doing, there are still more mountains to climb to be the ultimate parent.""No one knows your child better than you do. Everyone can give advice on what they think we're supposed to do and it should be taken as just that  advice,"" says Colleen Newman, mother of two in Westminster, Maryland, and founder of My Baby and More Parent Coaching and Educational Services.""Parenting advice books can be a wonderful resource  if you don't take them too seriously,"" says author and mother of four Paula Spencer.She urges moms to ""scan and skim"" advice books, but discourages them from ""trying to follow a whole style of parenting with its own label: attachment parenting, proactive parenting, scream-free parenting, or anything involving a prescribed schedule.""""Use them to give you a big picture of things like child development so you have a sense about what's normal child behavior, or to find ideas on how to solve a particular problem, such as colic or toilet training,"" Spencer explains. ""Compare the advice across a number of different books and don't fall into the trap of thinking any one has all the answers.""Mom versus momIt's not just external forces putting pressure on moms, though. Unfortunately, we also judge each other.""Moms who work look down on moms who don't and vice versa,"" says Miller. ""I had people saying, 'Why didn't you breastfeed longer?' 'Why is he in daycare already?' and 'Ooh, I didn't leave my child alone during his first two years.'""""We need to appreciate people's different ways of raising their kids,"" she adds. ""Mothers are constantly criticized. But you have to do what's true to your heart, and that's good parenting. Everyone will have opinions on what's right and wrong, and there's nothing to say what you're doing is right or wrong, but we're all giving it our best, really.""""We need to support each other to do the best we can, even if our choices are different from other moms',"" says Rebecca Kaminsky, mother of two boys in Berkeley, California, who writes about her experience with postpartum depression on the Web site Literary Mama.Still, each woman interviewed for this article agreed that she is probably her own biggest critic.""I'm hard on myself with everything,"" says Darcel Harmon of Cleveland, Ohio, who also suffered from postpartum depression after having her daughter, Nakiah, two years ago. ""But I also realize that I'm still learning and I'm the best mom I can be to my daughter.""We've got to lighten up on ourselves.""I'm so not perfect,"" laughs Karen Spring, mother of 3-year-old twin boys in Deptford, New Jersey. ""I used to feel guilty about disciplining my twins, but now I realize how important it is,"" Spring adds. ""A timeout isn't hurting anyone now and then. I also try not to panic over every little fall, bump, and bruise. My boys are both smart, well rounded, and speak exceptionally well and I secretly say to myself, 'Geez, despite everything, you must be doing something right.'""Leslie Crawford, mom of two in San Francisco, California, says, ""Personally, I've found that when I let down my 'I must be perfect and have a perfect family' guard  whether it means having a messy house, letting my son be grumpy, or letting my daughter cry  all is better in the end. It's more relaxed; we all are.""Stop the insanity!Many moms, like Jen Lawrence, mother of two in Toronto, who blogs at MUBAR (Mothered Up Beyond All Recognition), admit that they're ""often checking the clock"" after a long day with the kids. And then, ""I feel guilty that I am not totally present when I'm with my children,"" adds Lawrence. ""When I feed my 6-month-old son, I often spend the time sketching out a blog post in my head rather than gazing into his eyes.""""For a long time, guilt was my middle name,"" says Karen Putz, who lives in a suburb outside of Chicago. ""With my first two kids, I tried to do everything by the book. I made sure the house looked great, the kids were served delicious meals, and I stayed on top of everything like a hawk. But having a third child changed that.""After giving birth to her third, she stopped trying so hard and ""started looking within. Today, I'm much more relaxed as a mom and I don't try to prove anything for someone else. Instead, I have my own goals and I'm living my life as a mom in a way that's good for me as well as my kids.""The mothers interviewed agree that there's at least one winning solution: Ask for help. Spread the responsibility around. It's supposed to take a village after all, right?""You don't have to do everything,"" says Karen Spring. ""When you have your baby, let others help you out wherever and whenever. And if people ask what they can do to help, never say, 'Nothing.' When people walk in your door, if they ask if they can help, tell them what to do, whether it's folding your clean laundry, emptying your dishwasher, feeding the baby, giving the baby a bath, whatever it is. Let people bring you meals, hold the baby when it fusses, or straighten up your kitchen.""Parenting experts agree that mothers need to be supported and encouraged. Doris Jeanette, a psychologist in Philadelphia who works with mothers, says, ""They need to trust and go in the direction that they know is correct for themselves.""Give me a breakYvonne Lefort, mother of an 8-year-old son in Moraga, California, and facilitator of the mothers' group Rediscovering Yourself in the Midst of Motherhood, says, ""Many moms feel guilty about taking time for themselves.""""But moms need breaks!"" she says. ""They need to nurture themselves so they can be better moms. Too many moms let themselves run on empty. Being a good mother also means taking care of yourself so you can give more of yourself to your children.""Indeed, it won't actually do your kids any good if you're stressed about being the perfect parent. Taking care of yourself is a priority. It's the ""airplane oxygen mask approach"": Put on your own mask first so you can better help whoever's sitting next to you.In fact, a study published in March 2006 concluded that a mother's mental health directly affects her kids. Kids whose moms were treated  successfully  for depression were much less likely to become depressed themselves. But if the mom's depression continued, her children were more likely to become depressed, too.""If you have a depressed mother, you ought to do everything you can to get her better, because there's a double effect,"" says study author Myrna Weissman, a professor of psychiatry and epidemiology at Columbia University and the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City.But Hilary Miller says she thinks it's not fair that we're only ""allowed"" to take care of ourselves because it has an impact on the family. ""Hello, people forget you're not just a mother  you're an individual who deserves to have a life and take care of yourself, too.""""You are important as a woman and an individual, not simply as a mother and wife,"" agrees mom-of-ten Kathryn Sansone in her book Woman First, Family Always: Real-Life Wisdom From a Mother of Ten (Meredith Books, January 2006). ""During 18 years of marriage, with children, I've learned that if a woman gives up an aspect of herself  either the woman in her, the mother, or the wife  the other two facets will suffer.""Moms are often expected to be martyrs. But we also buy into that role. So how do we put out that self-roasting bonfire?""As with anything important, taking care of yourself requires both conscious commitment and action,"" says Sansone. ""Taking care of yourself means staying focused on your priorities while at the same time giving yourself a break when you need to.""Sophia Raday, mom to a 4-year-old son in Berkeley, California, is married to a policeman and Army Reserve colonel who works very long hours. She gets ""me-time"" by planning dinners with other mother friends. ""The kids entertain each other and the parents can have a glass of wine and do that stop-and-start-and-stop-again conversation thing.""Michelle Combs, mother of two sons in Costa Mesa, California, says that taking a break doesn't necessarily mean being away from your kids. ""Playing basketball with my boys or singing lame karaoke songs at the top of our lungs helps me to blow off some steam  without having to drop them off at a sitter's,"" Combs says.""The one thing that no one ever told me was that being a mother is the hardest job you will ever have,"" says Cindy Kuehnle, mom of a 1-year-old son in Waldwick, New Jersey. ""I don't think there is any way to prepare for it, just try to set realistic goals for each day. And don't forget to give yourself a break.""This includes forgiving yourself  daily, if needed. ""You're gonna screw up, but you have to remember that it's not the end of the world,"" says Miller. ""Let it go. Move on. I turned out okay, my husband turned out okay, I think our kids are going to be okay, too.""The BabyCenter Seven: Wisdom for Happier Mothering1. We all have guilt  just don't let it take hold. ""Every mom has her own tailor-made set of guilt triggers,"" says Paula Spencer, mother of four. ""I think we feel guilty precisely because we are so well intentioned and want to do the best we can by our kids. I don't think it's entirely possible get rid of guilt  you just have to stop taking it seriously.""2. Sharing makes you realize you're not alone. ""Seek out support,"" says Colleen Newman. ""By sharing with others you'll be reassured that you're not alone. Don't be afraid to talk about how your toddler flushed your razor down the toilet. They will probably tell you about the time their toddler used their toothbrush to clean the toilet! Laughing about the absurdities of parenting makes everything a lot easier.""3. Your instincts are just fine. ""Good parenting comes from the heart and gut,"" says mom Elaine Whitesides of Michigan. It's not about being perfect, she explains, but simply living by ""the golden rule"" of treating others the way you want to be treated.4. It's a learning process. ""I learned to take care of myself gradually, and I continue to learn valuable lessons about how best to do that,"" says Kathryn Sansone, whose children range in age from 8 months to 18 years. ""Now, ten children and 19 years of marriage later, I can say that on most evenings when my husband walks through the door, I can smile.""5. Taking care of yourself is important. ""Do one thing each day that nurtures you,"" says Yvonne Lefort. ""Take a bath, go for a walk, listen to your favorite music, make yourself a cup of hot tea, call a friend, read a chapter from a good book, buy a new lipstick! Do something nice for yourself each day, even if it's only for a few minutes.""6. You are doing your best. ""We are all doing our best, even when we fall short,"" says Sybil Lockhart, mother of two girls, ages 5 and 9, in Berkeley, California. ""Since we can't do any better than our best, we may as well call that perfect.""7. Your kids will be okay  really. ""I just look at how well he is doing,"" says Sherri Helwig, mother of a 4-year-old son in Scarborough, Canada. ""Although I sometimes wonder if this is actually because of our faults rather than in spite of them. When our son sees us make mistakes  and take responsibility for those mistakes and fix them  I think he learns a valuable lesson."""
Sample baby schedules for 5- and 6-month-olds,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sample-baby-schedules-for-5-and-6-month-olds_3657233.bc,"Getting into a routine with your baby is a personal thing. You'll learn to read your baby's cues to develop a pattern of eating, sleeping, and playing that meets your little one's needs and works for your family.That said, it can be a big help to see what other moms and dads are doing. We asked parents of 5- and 6-month-olds to share their baby's daily schedule, then picked the eight below as a helpful representation.As you're creating a schedule for your baby, keep in mind that at 5 and 6 months most babies need:Up to 32 ounces of breast milk or formula in a 24-hour period. (Get specific tips on how to tell whether your baby is getting enough breast milk or formula.) Most babies start solid foods at this age, though they'll still get most of their nutrition from breast milk or formula.About 14 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period  this includes nighttime sleep and naps.

See all videosSchedule 1: A breastfeeding attachment-parenting mom of a 6-month-oldEditor's note: This schedule is a baby-led routine6 to 8 a.m.: Piper (who sleeps with me) moves around without waking, and I nurse her or pat her and she continues to sleep.8 to 9 a.m.: I kiss Piper awake and we snuggle in the bed for a few minutes. I take off her diaper and pj's and give her a T-shirt or short dress. I sign ""potty"" and we go to the living room so she can pee in her little potty. (We're doing infant potty training.)9 to 10 a.m.: Piper plays on the floor wearing a cloth diaper or without a diaper (I put waterproof pads over the rug). She squeals at the cat and I show her the signs for ""cat"" and the things she's playing with. I've only been trying baby signing for a week.10 a.m.: Nurse and nap. She usually sleeps about 45 minutes in her bassinet in our bedroom. I prep things for our day and maybe grab a few minutes on the computer. When Piper wakes, I dress her and put her in a disposable diaper. She gets more time on the floor with toys and books and maybe a Mister Rogers record.11:15 a.m.: One more try on the potty, and I slide Piper into the sling, shoulder my bag, and head for the bus. Piper likes to look around as we walk, and she insists on coming out of the sling for at least part of the bus ride. She smiles at everyone and gets a lot of attention. It must take a lot of energy, because she usually wants to take another short nap toward the end of the bus ride and while we walk the four blocks from the bus to work. On the days we don't work, we hit the park or the library or run errands that we can do on foot.Baby sleep: Tips for napping Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:07Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:07Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all baby videosNoon: Greet the teenagers I'm babysitting and offer them lunch. I give Piper a chance to use the potty. I feed the kids, we play cards or video games, and Piper ""helps"" or plays on the floor with the toys we keep there. Every time someone wins or makes a good play, they tell Piper about it at high volume and she laughs and kicks.2 p.m.: Piper's laughter starts getting that hysterical edge, and we break off for nursing and a nap. She sleeps in a Moses basket in the laundry room for about 40 minutes, and then gets up for more play. We go outside to watch the turtle or the kids playing basketball. If she seems clingy, I'll carry her around in the sling so she can see everything but doesn't have to interact unless she wants to.5 to 6 p.m.: I make dinner for the kids, depending on when their parents are coming home, and Piper and I nurse again, then head home or to a friend's house on the bus. Piper often takes a little nap while we're walking, and she doesn't always need to get out of the sling when we're on the bus going back. On the days we don't work, she naps sometime between 4 and 5 p.m.6:30 to 7 p.m.: We get home, and I'm pretty tired. Piper gets to spend some time with Daddy or in a bouncer while I make dinner. Sometimes she's tired at 7 p.m., but I know if I put her to bed that early she won't sleep through the night. Sometimes Piper tries some mashed-up fruits or veggies, depending on what we're eating. I keep giving her tiny bites of food as long as she seems interested.9 p.m.: Dress for bed, nurse in the papasan chair or in bed, and I place Piper asleep in the bassinet (she's really outgrowing it, but I haven't figured out the physics of getting a crib into our postage-stamp-size bedroom yet). She fusses about every 40 minutes, and I pat or nurse her back to sleep. I'm careful to get lots of help from my husband at night or to go to bed early because I'm not my best self when I'm overtired. After I put Piper to bed is when I'm most likely to feel overwhelmed by household responsibilities, but in the morning they're easily managed.9:30 to 11 p.m.: I take Piper into bed with me when I go to bed. She nurses again and then usually sleeps soundly until 6 a.m. But sometimes she's fitful and needs comfort every hour. There really isn't an in-between.

Black women and pregnancy: High blood pressure,https://www.babycenter.com/0_black-women-and-pregnancy-high-blood-pressure_10326262.bc,"What does it mean to have high blood pressure?Blood pressure is the force exerted by the blood pushing against the artery walls. When the pressure in the arteries becomes too high, it's called high blood pressure, or hypertension.A blood pressure reading is given as two numbers. The first number represents the pressure created when your heart beats (systolic pressure); the second number is the pressure when the heart is at rest between beats (diastolic pressure). High blood pressure is defined as a reading of 140/90 or higher, even if just one of the numbers is higher.Most pregnant women with high blood pressure have healthy babies, but a few have problems. High blood pressure problems occur in 6 percent to 8 percent of all pregnancies in the United States. The complications may be mild or severe, and can include preterm labor and low birth weight.African American women are more likely than other women to have high blood pressure, but any woman of any race can have it.What are the different types of high blood pressure?There are four types of high blood pressure that can affect pregnant women:Chronic hypertension: This is ongoing high blood pressure that's diagnosed before pregnancy or before the 20th week of pregnancy. If a woman is diagnosed with gestational hypertension (starting after 20 weeks) and her blood pressure is still high 12 weeks after delivery, the condition is also considered chronic. Read more about chronic hypertension during pregnancy.Gestational hypertension: This form of high blood pressure develops after 20 weeks of pregnancy and goes away after delivery. Read more about gestational hypertension.Preeclampsia: This is a serious disorder that occurs when a pregnant woman has high blood pressure and protein in her urine after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Untreated preeclampsia can cause serious complications to mother and baby that could become fatal. Preeclampsia affects 3 to 8 percent of pregnant women, and it's even more common among African Americans. Chronic and gestational hypertension are risk factors for preeclampsia. Read more about preeclampsia.Chronic hypertension with preeclampsia: As many as 1 in 4 women with chronic hypertension and half of women with severe chronic hypertension (180/110 or higher) also develop preeclampsia during pregnancy.Why is it especially important for black women to know about high blood pressure and preeclampsia?High blood pressure, often called simply ""pressure"" in the black community, is more common among black women than in the general population. In the United States, 45 percent of non-Hispanic black females age 20 and older have high blood pressure, compared with 27 percent of non-Hispanic white women. What's more, African American women have an 85 percent higher rate of medical visits for high blood pressure than Caucasian women.It's unclear why high blood pressure is more common in black women than in women of other racial groups in the United States. Some studies link high levels of hypertension among black women to physical inactivity. For non-Hispanic black females age 18 and older, 33.9 percent are inactive, compared with 21.6 percent of non-Hispanic white females.Preeclampsia is also more prevalent in black women, although exactly how much more common it is in African Americans than in Caucasians isn't known. Also, the disorder is likely to be more severe and show up earlier in black women, when they are 6 months pregnant, while it typically develops in white women when they are 7 to 8 months pregnant.Medical professionals don't know why black women are more likely to develop preeclampsia, but they suspect that it's related to the higher rates of hypertension. Also, one study found that black women had less folic acid and more of a certain amino acid than white women. The study suggested that black women might benefit from taking more folic acid during pregnancy. What causes high blood pressure?In most cases of high blood pressure, there's no identifiable cause. This is called essential hypertension or primary hypertension.Studies show that a number of factors can raise a woman's risk of primary high blood pressure. In the United States, blacks are twice as likely as whites to have high blood pressure, although the gap begins to narrow around age 44. After age 65, black women have a higher rate of high blood pressure than any other group of people.You're also more likely to develop high blood pressure if you have a family history of the disease, and your risk increases as you age.Other risk factors include smoking, stress, obesity, alcohol abuse, a diet high in fat or salt, low potassium intake, lack of physical activity, and certain chronic conditions such as diabetes and high cholesterol.About 5 to 10 percent of cases of high blood pressure are due to underlying conditions such as kidney abnormalities, tumors of the adrenal gland, congenital heart defects, and certain medications such as birth control pills, cold remedies, and decongestants. This type of high blood pressure, called secondary hypertension, tends to appear suddenly and cause higher blood pressure than primary hypertension.What causes preeclampsia?Researchers have learned a lot about preeclampsia in the last decade, but many aspects of the condition remain a mystery. Experts believe that placental abnormalities, genetics, nutrition, certain underlying diseases, and the way your immune system reacts to pregnancy may play a role.Studies also show that these risk factors make it more likely that a woman will develop preeclampsia:Past personal history of preeclampsiaFirst pregnancyFamily history of preeclampsiaPast personal history of chronic high blood pressure, kidney disease, diabetes, certain thrombophilias (blood-clotting disorders), systemic lupus erythematosus, and other autoimmune disordersMultiple pregnancy (carrying two or more babies)Age younger than 20 years or older than 35African AmericanObesity (body mass index of 30 or more)For more information, see our article on preeclampsia.What are the symptoms of preeclampsia and other types of high blood pressure?If you have mild preeclampsia and other forms of high blood pressure, you might not have any symptoms. But more severe cases may be accompanied by the following:Severe or persistent headacheVision changes, including double vision, blurred vision, seeing spots of flashing light, sensitivity to light, or temporary loss of visionDizzinessIntense pain or tenderness in your upper abdomenWeight gain of more than 4 pounds per weekSudden swelling in your face or puffiness around your eyes, more than slight swelling of your hands, or excessive or sudden swelling of your feet or anklesNausea and vomiting (other than morning sickness in early pregnancy)Call your caregiver immediately if you have any of these warning signs.Some symptoms, such as swelling and weight gain, may seem like normal pregnancy complaints, so you might not know you have the condition until it's discovered at a routine prenatal visit. This is one of the reasons it's so important not to miss your appointments. What are the risks if I have high blood pressure or preeclampsia during pregnancy?A pregnant woman with severe preeclampsia or severe hypertension is at risk for congestive heart failure, seizures, kidney or liver problems, vision changes, and stroke. Some studies have shown that women over 40 who have had hypertension for 15 or more years are the most likely to have these problems.All forms of high blood pressure can cause complications during pregnancy and birth. Those include:Low birth weight High blood pressure can cause the blood vessels to constrict and decrease in the uterus, which will affect the supply of oxygen and nutrients to the baby.Placental abruption When the placenta partially or completely peels away from the uterine wall before delivery, it can deprive the baby of oxygen and nutrients and cause heavy bleeding in the mother. Untreated abruption is dangerous for both mother and child.Preterm delivery Some women with severe high blood pressure or preeclampsia require an early delivery to prevent potentially life-threatening complications to the mother and child.The risk for these complications is highest for women with severe chronic hypertension accompanied by preeclampsia. And having chronic hypertension significantly increases your risk of developing preeclampsia. As many as 1 in 4 women with chronic hypertension and half of women with severe chronic hypertension will develop preeclampsia during pregnancy.How is high blood pressure monitored and managed during pregnancy?With close observation and careful management, most women with chronic or gestational hypertension have healthy pregnancies.At every prenatal appointment, a caregiver will take your blood pressure by wrapping an inflatable cuff around your upper arm. Your urine will be checked for excess protein to determine whether you have preeclampsia.Ultrasounds and fetal heart rate testing are usually done repeatedly to measure your baby's well-being. Your provider may refer you to a high-risk pregnancy specialist, called a perinatologist.It's important to go to all of your prenatal appointments because hypertension can get significantly worse during pregnancy and cause serious problems for you and your baby. But also keep in mind that blood pressure often becomes somewhat lower on its own during the second trimester, says Andrea Jackson, an ob-gyn at the Physician & Midwife Collaborative in Alexandria, Virginia. ""This is not a sign to lose vigilance, because it typically goes back up in the third trimester,"" she says.If you have chronic high blood pressure, it's a good idea to see your healthcare provider before you try to conceive. A preconception appointment allows your provider to ensure that your blood pressure is under control and to evaluate any medication you're taking.While some medications are considered safe during pregnancy, others  such as ACE inhibitors  should not be taken during pregnancy.It's important to take prescription medication according to the instructions you're given. Don't stop taking it or adjust the dosage without your caregiver's consent.If you have mild hypertension, your provider may advise you to stop taking your medication or reduce the dose. If it's severe, you'll probably need to take medication throughout your pregnancy.If at any time during pregnancy, your blood pressure gets too high, you'll be hospitalized until it's under control.For more information, see our articles on chronic hypertension and gestational hypertension. Can I have a regular delivery if I have high blood pressure?You and your healthcare provider will discuss how and when you should deliver your baby. Women with mild high blood pressure typically have regular deliveries.If you have severe high blood pressure, your provider may suggest that you deliver a few weeks before your due date to prevent complications. He'll determine whether it's better for you to have a c-section or to be induced and attempt to deliver vaginally.How is preeclampsia managed during pregnancy?It depends on how severe the preeclampsia is, how far along you are, and how your baby's doing. You'll probably be hospitalized for an initial assessment  and possibly for the rest of your pregnancy.Mild preeclampsia: If your condition is mild, expect to visit your provider a few times a week. Your baby's well-being will be monitored with tests, such as ultrasounds and fetal heart rate screenings.You'll get regular urine and blood tests to see whether the preeclampsia is progressing and harming your health. Your provider might recommend that you reduce your activity.If the preeclampsia develops several weeks before your due date, your provider may recommend bedrest to lower your blood pressure and increase blood flow to your placenta, which gives your baby time to mature. There's no standard definition of bedrest, so make sure you understand how much activity is allowed.Your provider also may prescribe an antihypertensive to lower your blood pressure until delivery.At 37 weeks or more, you'll likely be induced, especially if your cervix is starting to thin out and dilate. If there are signs that you or your baby won't be able to tolerate labor, you'll have a c-section.Severe preeclampsia: Expectant moms with severe preeclampsia are almost always hospitalized. In the hospital their baby's health and the amniotic fluid level is monitored through fetal heart testing and ultrasounds. (Low amniotic fluid indicates poor blood supply to the baby.)If you're at 34 weeks or more, you'll be induced or, in certain situations, delivered by c-section. If you're at less than 34 weeks, you'll be given corticosteroids to help your baby's lungs mature more quickly. If you don't deliver immediately, both you and your baby will be monitored very closely.Most moms with severe preeclampsia spend the remainder of their pregnancy in the hospital, and are often cared for by a high-risk pregnancy specialist, called a perinatologist.Read our complete preeclampsia article for more information.What is HELLP syndrome?About 20 percent of women with severe preeclampsia also develop a disorder called HELLP syndrome. The name is an acronym for hemolysis, the breakdown of red blood cells; elevated liver enzymes; and low platelets, the blood cells that are necessary for clotting.Symptoms may include nausea and vomiting, headache, upper abdominal pain and general malaise. Women with HELLP syndrome can develop these symptoms during pregnancy or in the first 48 hours after delivery. They're treated with medications to control blood pressure and prevent seizures, and sometimes with blood transfusions. If still pregnant, they almost always require early delivery to prevent serious complications.If you develop preeclampsia, you'll have your blood tested periodically for signs of HELLP syndrome.Some U.S. studies have found that, for unknown reasons, HELLP is less common in African Americans than in Caucasians. What is eclampsia?Infrequently, preeclampsia can lead to seizures, a condition called eclampsia. ""Pre-eclampsia"" is so named because it's the condition that precedes these seizures. Eclampsia can have very serious consequences for both the mother and the baby.Sometimes, the seizures occur without warning. For this reason, all women with severe preeclampsia and many women with mild preeclampsia are given magnesium sulfate, an antiseizure medication.The seizures may also be preceded by symptoms such as severe or persistent headache, vision changes (blurred vision, seeing spots, or sensitivity to light, for example), mental confusion, or intense upper abdominal pain.Some U.S. studies have found that, for unknown reasons, eclampsia is more common in African Americans than in Caucasians.Can I have a regular delivery if I have preeclampsia?If you have preeclampsia, your doctor or midwife will monitor you closely in the third trimester. If you have severe preeclampsia, your provider may want your baby to be delivered early  at 34 weeks or later. You'll be induced or have a c-section at the first sign that the preeclampsia is getting worse or your baby is not thriving.What can I do to prevent complications if I have high blood pressure during pregnancy?""You have to keep your blood pressure under control during pregnancy,"" says Gail Jackson, an ob-gyn with a private practice in the Cedars Sinai Medical Towers in Beverly Hills. ""The best way to accomplish that is by taking care of yourself."" Here are some tips:Before becoming pregnantTalk to your healthcare provider. If you have high blood pressure, it's important to schedule a preconception appointment with the provider who'll be handing your pregnancy. Your doctor or midwife will evaluate how well you're managing your high blood pressure and consider any treatment changes you may need to make before getting pregnant. If you take medication, your provider might tell you to change the dose or the type of medicine. Some are safe, but others such as ACE inhibitors  may raise the risk of birth defects when taken during pregnancy.Lead a healthy lifestyle. Most providers will want to make sure your blood pressure is under control before you get pregnant. If it's not, your doctor or midwife will probably suggest that you make some lifestyle changes such as limiting salt intake, exercising, and losing weight.During pregnancyEat healthy. Geddis Abel-Bey, an ob-gyn with a private practice in Queens, recommends seeing a nutritionist. ""The things that led you to have high blood pressure are probably diet-related. I can tell you to throw the salt shaker out the window and put the smoked meats away, but I can't follow you home. You have to learn to eat better for you, your baby, and hopefully for your lifetime,"" he says.Get plenty of rest. Reduce stress and limit work hours. Take naps if you can. Prepare yourself for the strong possibility of being on bedrest in the third trimester, especially if you develop preeclampsia.Take your medicine. The good news is that many blood pressure medications have been in use for 30 years and have been proved safe and effective during pregnancy. Take your medication exactly as prescribed.Watch your weight. It's important to gain enough weight to support your baby's growth, but putting on too much weight can put additional stress on your heart.Avoid smoking and alcohol. If you smoke or drink, it's now more important than ever to stop.Go to your prenatal appointments. Start prenatal care early and continue it through the pregnancy. This allows your healthcare provider to find and treat conditions such as preeclampsia early.Is there any way to avoid getting preeclampsia?No one knows for sure how to prevent preeclampsia, although there's a lot of research going on in this area. A number of studies have looked into whether taking extra calcium, vitamins, folic acid, or a low dose of aspirin can help.Read more about preeclampsia.What will happen after the birth?If you have gestational hypertension or mild preeclampsia, delivery is the only cure. Blood pressure usually returns to normal after the birth. If not, your provider may prescribe medication.Women with severe preeclampsia usually remain under close supervision for a few days after giving birth. Your caregiver will keep tabs on your blood pressure and watch for signs of other complications. Many cases of eclampsia and HELLP syndrome happen after delivery, usually within 48 hours.If you have chronic hypertension, you may still be at risk for some complications as your cardiovascular system readjusts after delivery. You will likely be monitored closely for at least 48 hours after birth and may have your blood pressure medication dosage adjusted.It is possible to develop preeclampsia after delivery, so let your provider know if you develop any symptoms, even after you return home.Women who have high blood pressure and preeclampsia are encouraged to breastfeed, even if they're taking medication. Your provider can prescribe medications that are safe for your breastfeeding baby."
Hispanic women and pregnancy: Gestational diabetes,https://www.babycenter.com/0_hispanic-women-and-pregnancy-gestational-diabetes_10346415.bc,"What is gestational diabetes?Gestational diabetes is a type of diabetes that some women get during pregnancy. Between 2 and 10 percent of expectant mothers develop this condition, making it one of the most common health problems of pregnancy. (The rate is even higher among Latinas.)Diabetes is complicated, but in a nutshell it means you have abnormally high levels of sugar in your blood. Here's what happens:When you eat, your digestive system breaks most of your food down into a type of sugar called glucose. The glucose enters your bloodstream and then, with the help of insulin (a hormone made by your pancreas), your cells use the glucose as fuel. However, if your body doesn't produce enough insulin  or your cells have a problem responding to the insulin  too much glucose remains in your blood instead of moving into the cells and getting converted to energy.When you're pregnant, hormonal changes can make your cells less responsive to insulin. For most moms-to-be, this isn't a problem: When the body needs additional insulin, the pancreas dutifully secretes more of it. But if your pancreas can't keep up with the increased insulin demand during pregnancy, your blood glucose levels rise too high, resulting in gestational diabetes.Most women with gestational diabetes don't continue to have the condition after their baby is born. Once you've had gestational diabetes, though, you're more likely to get it during a future pregnancy and to develop diabetes later in life.Why do Hispanic women need to know about gestational diabetes?Gestational diabetes disproportionately affects pregnant Latinas. In fact, Latinas have a greater predisposition to all types of diabetes, and 1 in 4 has some form of the disease. Latinas have a 52.5 percent risk of developing diabetes in their lifetime. The risk for Caucasian women is slightly higher than 31 percent.The genetic predisposition for diabetes puts Latinas at higher risk of developing gestational diabetes. This is especially true because, in many cases, Latinas don't even know they have diabetes when they get pregnant.Overall, more than 11 percent of the Hispanic population has diabetes, but the disease affects certain groups more than others. Puerto Ricans, for example, have the highest rates of diagnosed diabetes with 12.6 percent, followed by Mexican Americans with 11.9 percent and Cubans with 8.2 percent.Something else to keep in mind is that diabetes in all its forms tends to affect Hispanics at younger ages than it does other races and ethnic populations. With more Latinas giving birth in the United States at younger ages than other women, it's important to check with your doctor before planning a family.How will I know if I have gestational diabetes?Gestational diabetes usually has no symptoms. That's why almost all pregnant women have a glucose screening test between 24 and 28 weeks.However, if you're at high risk for diabetes (as Latinas generally are) or are showing signs of it (such as having sugar in your urine), your healthcare provider will recommend this screening test at your first prenatal visit and then repeat the test at 24 to 28 weeks if the initial result is negative.If you do show a positive result on a glucose screening test, it doesn't necessarily mean that you have gestational diabetes. But it does mean that you'll need to take a longer follow-up test (a glucose tolerance test, or GTT) to find out for sure. How can I tell whether I'm at high risk for gestational diabetes?As a Hispanic  or a member of any other ethnic group with a high incidence of diabetes  you're considered to be at high risk for gestational diabetes. In addition, according to the American Diabetes Association, you're at high risk (and should be screened early) if:You're obese (your body mass index is over 30).You've had gestational diabetes in a previous pregnancy.You have sugar in your urine.You have a strong family history of diabetes.More than 76 percent of Latinas in the United States are overweight, with 45 percent of them considered obese. That plus the fact that Latinas have a genetic predisposition to diabetes are two powerful reasons to get checked for the disease.Some healthcare providers will also screen you early if you have other risk factors, such as:You've previously given birth to a big baby. Some use 8 pounds, 13 ounces as the cutoff; others use 9 pounds, 14 ounces.You've had an unexplained stillbirth.You've had a baby with a birth defect.You have high blood pressure.You're 35 or older.In addition, a study published in the March 2010 issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology found an association between excessive weight gain during pregnancy  particularly in the first trimester  and the risk of gestational diabetes. Researchers found the risk highest in women who were overweight to begin with and in nonwhite women.Keep in mind that many women who develop gestational diabetes don't have any risk factors. That's why most providers order the screening at 24 to 28 weeks for all their pregnant patients.How does having gestational diabetes affect my pregnancy?Most women who develop diabetes during pregnancy go on to have healthy babies. Dietary changes and exercise may be enough to keep your blood sugar levels under control. Sometimes medication is needed, too.Latinas who have diabetes are vulnerable to many more risks. To protect yourself, you must be vigilant about prevention, symptoms, and medical supervision.How does having gestational diabetes affect my baby in utero?Poorly controlled diabetes can have serious short- and long-term consequences for your baby.If your blood sugar levels are too high, too much glucose ends up in your baby's blood. Your baby's pancreas then has to produce more insulin to process it. All that excess blood sugar and insulin can cause your baby to put on extra weight while still in utero, particularly in the upper body.This can lead to what's called macrosomia. A macrosomic baby may be too large to enter the birth canal. Or the baby's head may enter the canal but then his shoulders may get stuck. In this situation, called shoulder dystocia, your doctor or midwife has to use special maneuvers to deliver your baby.Delivery sometimes results in a fractured bone or nerve damage. Both of these heal without permanent problems in nearly 99 percent of babies. (In very rare cases, the baby suffers brain damage from lack of oxygen.)The maneuvers needed to deliver a broad-shouldered baby can also lead to injuries to the vaginal area or require a large episiotomy for you.Because of these risks, if it looks like your baby may be overly large, your healthcare provider may recommend that you give birth by cesarean section. Fortunately, only a minority of women with well-controlled gestational diabetes end up with overly large babies.Some studies have found a link between severe gestational diabetes and an increased risk of stillbirth in the last two months of pregnancy. Women with gestational diabetes are also more likely to develop preeclampsia, especially if they were obese before pregnancy or if their blood sugar levels aren't well controlled. How does having gestational diabetes affect my baby after birth?Babies who have excessive fat stores as a result of high maternal sugar levels during pregnancy often continue to be overweight in childhood and adulthood.Shortly after birth, your baby may have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) because his body is still producing extra insulin in response to your excess glucose. This is much more likely if your blood sugar levels were high during pregnancy and especially if they were high during labor.Your delivery team will test your baby's blood sugar at birth and continue to check it as needed by taking a drop of blood from his heel. Feeding your baby as soon as possible after birth, preferably by breastfeeding, can help prevent or correct hypoglycemia.In severe cases of hypoglycemia, though, your baby will receive an IV glucose solution. Testing your newborn's blood sugar and providing an IV if necessary can prevent serious problems such as seizures, coma, and brain damage.Your baby may also be at higher risk for breathing problems at birth, particularly if your blood sugar levels aren't well controlled or you deliver early. (The lungs of babies whose mothers have diabetes tend to mature a bit later.) The risk of newborn jaundice goes up, too.If your blood sugar control is especially poor, your baby is at risk for polycythemia (an increase in the number of red cells in the blood) and hypocalcemia (low calcium in the blood), and your baby's heart function could be affected.What will I need to do if I have gestational diabetes?You'll need to keep diligent track of your glucose levels while you're pregnant, using a home glucose meter or strips. To keep those levels where they should be, you'll be advised to:Eat a well-planned diet. The American Diabetes Association recommends getting nutritional counseling from a registered dietitian. The dietitian can help you develop specific meal and snack plans based on your height, weight, and activity level.Your diet must have the correct balance of protein, fats, and carbohydrates, while providing the proper vitamins, minerals, and calories. To keep your glucose levels stable, it's very important that you don't skip meals, especially breakfast, and that you avoid sugary items like candy, cookies, cakes, and soda.You also need to stay away from simple carbohydrates, such as white-flour tortillas and white bread. These are digested easily and pass quickly into the bloodstream, raising your glucose levels immediately. It's best to eat whole-grain and corn tortillas and whole-grain bread. These complex carbohydrates take longer to digest, calling for lower levels of insulin to handle the glucose that enters the blood.This may sound daunting, but it's not so hard once you get the hang of it.Don't think of yourself as being on a special or restrictive diet. The principles of the diabetes diet are good ones for everyone to follow. Think of this as an opportunity to create healthier eating habits for yourself and your whole family. If everyone in the house is eating the same foods, you won't feel as deprived.Exercise. Studies show that moderate exercise helps improve your body's ability to process glucose, keeping blood sugar levels in check. Many women with gestational diabetes benefit from 30 minutes of daily aerobic activity, such as walking or swimming. Ask your healthcare provider what level of physical activity would be beneficial for you.Take insulin if necessary. If you're unable to control your blood sugar well enough with diet and exercise alone, your provider will prescribe insulin shots for you to give yourself. About 15 percent of women with gestational diabetes need insulin. Recently, some providers have been prescribing oral medications instead of injections for some cases of gestational diabetes.Will I need additional testing while I'm pregnant?Your healthcare provider may want to monitor your baby more intensively during your last two to three months of pregnancy, depending on the severity of your diabetes and whether you have any other medical or obstetrical problems.More prenatal visits and testingThis will probably mean that you'll have more frequent prenatal visits than you normally would. You'll need to start counting your baby's movements at 28 weeks so you can alert your provider immediately if you sense that your baby is less active.If you can't keep your blood sugar under control or it's high enough that you need medication, or if you have any other risk factors, you'll probably be tested to check on your baby's well-being beginning at about 32 weeks (and possibly as early as 28 weeks, depending on your individual situation).This testing may include fetal heart monitoring (nonstress tests) and periodic ultrasound tests called biophysical profiles. If you have mild gestational diabetes kept well under control without medication and you have no other problems, you probably won't begin these tests until about 36 weeks or possibly later.More ultrasoundsYou may also have one or more ultrasounds during the third trimester to monitor your baby's growth. Your provider may order one in the early part of the third trimester to help assess your need for medication.You'll probably have an ultrasound close to your due date, too. If your baby seems to be getting very big, your delivery might be induced before your due date, or your provider may recommend delivering by c-section.Note: If your diabetes was diagnosed in the first half of your pregnancy, it's more likely that you had unrecognized diabetes before you conceived. In this case, your provider may order a fetal echocardiogram (an ultrasound that focuses on your baby's heart). The risk of birth defects, especially heart defects, is higher if your blood sugar was high during the first eight weeks of pregnancy, when your baby's body was being formed. Will I continue to have diabetes after my baby is born?Most women with gestational diabetes don't remain diabetic after giving birth. But you will be more likely to develop gestational diabetes again during your next pregnancy.Latina moms who have had gestational diabetes are also more likely to develop type 2 diabetes in the five to ten years after their pregnancy. According to one study, each year after the pregnancy in which they had gestational diabetes, 12 percent of Mexican American women developed type 2 diabetes.As many as a third of women who've had gestational diabetes will continue to have either diabetes or what's known as impaired glucose tolerance. That means their glucose levels are higher than normal, but not as high as they would be with diabetes.For this reason, you'll need to have a glucose test about six to 12 weeks after delivery. This test requires fasting overnight and can be done at your six-week postpartum doctor visit.For moms who had gestational diabetes and have a normal postpartum screening, the American Diabetes Association recommends repeat testing at least every three years.Does having gestational diabetes put me at higher risk for diabetes in the future?Yes. About one-third to one-half of women who have gestational diabetes will have it again in a later pregnancy. And up to 50 percent of women with gestational diabetes will develop diabetes at some point in the future. Your risk is highest if any of the following apply to you:You're obese. (Your risk is 50 to 75 percent if you're obese and less than 25 percent if you're at a normal weight.)You had very high blood sugar levels during pregnancy (especially if you needed medication).Your gestational diabetes was diagnosed early in pregnancy.The results of your postpartum glucose test were borderline (relatively high, but not high enough to classify you as a diabetic).What can I do to minimize my risk of developing diabetes in the future?Keeping your weight down, making healthy food choices, and exercising regularly can help ward off the disease.In addition, breastfeeding your baby may provide you with some protection. There's research suggesting an association between breastfeeding and higher postpartum weight loss, as well as a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes and cardiovascular disease.For Latinas, developing a support system also helps. Work on learning and sharing what you find out about diabetes, healthy foods to eat, and activities you can do with others. Research shows that what's most helpful for Latinas is a sense of support from people who care about your getting better and managing your condition.What can I do to minimize related risks for my child through infancy and beyond?It starts during pregnancy. Do your best to keep your blood sugar levels in check while your baby is in utero. (See ""What will I need to do if I have gestational diabetes?"")After birth, nurse your baby. There's evidence that breastfeeding has a positive effect on glucose metabolism and may help prevent childhood obesity and reduce your child's risk of diabetes, among other things.Your child is at higher risk for childhood and adult obesity, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. So it's particularly important that you help him eat a healthy diet, maintain a normal weight, and stay physically active.Finally, be sure your child's healthcare provider knows that you had diabetes during pregnancy.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2001 (reaffirmed 2008).
