Everything You Need to Know About Aspartame,http://www.foodinsight.org/articles/everything-you-need-know-about-aspartame,"What is Aspartame?   Reviewed by the American Academy of Physician Assistants  			Download the PDF to view this entire brochure.     Aspartame is a low-calorie sweetener that provides sweetness to foods and beverages without adding significant calories. Nutrition and fitness experts agree that balancing the calories you consume with the calories you burn is important for health. Aspartame can play a role in weight management programs that combine sensible nutrition and physical activity.   Aspartame has been studied extensively and has been found to be safe by experts and researchers. Government agencies worldwide, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have also reviewed the science and found aspartame to be safe for human consumption.   Aspartame consists of two amino acids (the building blocks of protein)  phenylalanine and aspartic acid. It is about 200 times sweeter than sugar, so very small amounts of aspartame are needed to provide the same sweet taste. Aspartame is available as a tabletop sweetener and in many products, including a variety of beverages, dairy products, canned fruits, desserts, confections, sauces and dressings. In addition to helping with weight management, aspartame does not cause dental cavities and may be consumed by people with diabetes.   How many calories are in aspartame?   Aspartame has four calories per gram. However, because it is 200 times sweeter than sugar, aspartame is used in very small amounts, thus adding almost no calories to foods and beverages. As a result, when aspartame is substituted for calorie-containing sweeteners, total calories in foods and beverages are significantly reduced (and sometimes eliminated entirely, such as in diet soda, tea, and flavored seltzer water). It is important to remember that there are other sources of calories in many foods and beverages  sugar-free does not always mean calorie-free. The calorie content of a food or beverage can be found in the Nutrition Facts Panel located on the product label.   How does aspartame fit into a healthful diet?   Aspartame and other low-calorie sweeteners add sweetness to foods and beverages without adding significant calories. Substituting aspartame for sugar or other calorie-containing sweeteners, like agave nectar and honey, can help people consume fewer calories throughout the day. For example, drinking just one aspartame-sweetened soft drink (look for diet versions of your favorite beverages, which often contain aspartame and/or another low-calorie sweetener) instead of a regular soft drink saves about 150 calories  see the chart to the right for other examples of calorie savings that can be achieved with aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages. These calorie savings can add up over time. Several studies have shown that such changes can reduce daily calories and help with weight loss and weight management.   Is aspartame safe to consume?   Yes. The FDA has confirmed that aspartame is safe for the general population, including certain sub-populations like children, people with diabetes and women who are pregnant or nursing. The single exception is individuals with a rare hereditary condition called phenylketonuria (PKU). People with PKU cannot metabolize phenylalanine, an amino acid that is found in aspartame, as well as meat, beans, and many other foods. Individuals with PKU should avoid foods containing phenylalanine, including aspartame. Foods and beverages sweetened with aspartame carry a statement on the label to alert people who have PKU to the presence of phenylalanine.   The safety of aspartame is supported by government bodies and leading independent health groups around the globe. Some of the many groups that have made official statements confirming the safety of aspartame include the American Diabetes Association, the American Dietetic Association, and the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Anecdotal reports of negative effects are not supported by the large body of scientific evidence and have not warranted any changes to aspartames use in countries worldwide (see Aspartames Global Safety Recognition on the back of this brochure).   More than 200 studies support the safety of aspartame. Experts, researchers and government bodies agree that people (other than individuals with PKU) can consume a variety of foods and beverages sweetened with aspartame on a daily basis without concern.   A large body of well-designed and widely-accepted research has found no association between aspartame and cancer. This conclusion has been re-affirmed recently by leading health and food safety regulatory authorities around the world, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and FDA. A few isolated studies in laboratory rats and mice have alleged a link between aspartame and cancer; however, leading scientists and regulatory agencies in the U.S. and internationally have found that the conclusions of these studies are not valid, due to significant problems with the design and interpretation of the studies.   Can people who have diabetes consume sweet foods and beverages containing aspartame?   Yes. Foods and beverages containing aspartame are safe for people who have diabetes. Products containing aspartame provide sweet, good-tasting options that are low in carbohydrates, which are useful for people who have diabetes and who must monitor their carbohydrate intake.   People who have diabetes should talk with a registered dietitian, health care professional, and/ or certified diabetes educator for advice on incorporating foods and beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners into their diets.   Can pregnant and breastfeeding women consume aspartame?   Yes. Foods and beverages containing aspartame can be part of a healthful diet for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Research has shown that aspartame has no adverse effects on expecting or nursing mothers. For women who consumed moderate amounts of foods and beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners before becoming pregnant, theres no need to eliminate them; however, they should also be sure to consume the necessary nutrients for their babys growth during pregnancy and breastfeeding as advised by their physician or health care professional.   Does aspartame cause weight gain?   No. Several studies have shown that low-calorie sweeteners, such as aspartame, can actually aid in weight loss and/or weight management when combined with a balanced diet and regular physical activity. For example, a study of people participating in a comprehensive weight loss program found that those who replaced products sweetened with sugar with those sweetened with aspartame lost weight. Aspartame also appeared to help with long-term weight maintenance.   A few small studies measuring self-reported hunger for a few hours in subjects who unknowingly consumed aspartame have suggested that low-calorie sweeteners may lead to cravings and/or weight gain. However, carefully designed studies that placed low-calorie sweeteners, including aspartame, into the diet over a period of weeks, without the subjects knowledge, have repeatedly reported reduced calorie intake and body weight. Such studies affirm that low-calorie sweeteners like aspartame are useful as weight loss/weight management aids.   Is aspartame safe for children?   Yes. There is no evidence that aspartame is harmful to children or other members of the general population (again, except for those with PKU). In fact, foods and beverages containing aspartame can be part of a healthful meal plan for children when included as part of a balanced diet rich in nutrients. It can be challenging to put together good-tasting, healthful meals and snacks for children and adolescents that provide important nutrients, but not a lot of extra calories. Incorporating some low-calorie, sugar-free foods and beverages may help improve the overall quality of the diet, while helping to keep weight in check. Registered dietitians and physicians can help parents make the right choices based on the childs individual calorie and nutrition needs.   Aspartames Global Safety Recognition   Aspartame was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981 for use in foods, followed by approval for use in beverages in 1983. In 1996, aspartame was approved as a general purpose sweetener. Prior to its approval, aspartame underwent a thorough scientific review, and regulators consider it one of the most widely-tested ingredients in the food supply. It is now approved for use in 136 countries worldwide. Examples of government and scientific groups that have reviewed aspartames safety include:   European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)   U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)   Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/ World Health Organization (WHO) Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA)   Health Canada   Food Standards Australia/New Zealand (FSANZ)   Foods and Beverages That May Contain Aspartame   More than 6,000 products marketed in more than 100 countries worldwide use aspartame as a sweetener. These food and beverage products include some:   Carbonated and other beverages (juices, iced tea, flavored waters, etc.)   Cereals   Chewing gums   Dairy products (low-fat flavored milk, light yogurt, etc.)   Canned fruits   Desserts (light pudding, light ice cream, popsicles, etc.)   Nutrition bars   Syrups and fruit spreads   Tabletop sweeteners   Aspartame is not very heat stable; therefore, it is not recommended for use in baking or in cooking methods that require extended exposure to high temperatures. Although there is no safety concern with doing so, the flavor breaks down, reducing the sweetness of the final product. Aspartame is typically used in prepared foods and beverages that do not require heating during preparation. Aspartame can also be added to a cup of coffee or tea."
A Useful Guide to Understanding GMOs,http://www.foodinsight.org/food-biotechnology-resources-gmos-agriculture-genetic-modification,"As food producers aim to provide a secure and reliable supply of foodfor the growing public, food biotechnology advances are evolving fast.Genetically modified food resources are helping farmers, food manufacturers, and companies produce safe, healthy, great-tasting and environmentally-friendly foods. However, understanding how these foods are created, how they end up on our plates,and the science behind the ingredients can be confusing. Below we have some insightful resources to help you understand how GMOs are shaping our food supply.           GMO-Free Milk: Is There Really Such a Thing?   Modern food production uses various technologies to ensure that our food supply yields safe and environmentally friendly foods. ""Genetically engineered"" foods, also known as ""genetically modified"" foods or GMOs, are safe for consumption, and this has been proven repeatedly by scientific research. Sowhat do package labels such as GMO-free and Non-GMO really mean?             Science Sent: GMOs Are Safe to Eat   For years, the debate over the safety of genetically engineered crops (or genetically modified organisms or GMOS) has come down to one statement: the science isnt there. According to a report published yesterday by the National Academy of Sciences (NAS), there is no difference in potential or adverse health effects in GMO crops compared to non-GMOs. In other words, GMO crops are as safe to eat as their non-GMO counterparts.             No Matter the Food, Ingredients Produced with Biotechnology Are As Safe As ""Non-GMO""   The International Food Information Council (IFIC) Foundation would like to correct media reports raising concerns about infant formula containing ingredients produced using biotechnology (also referred to as genetically engineered ingredientsorGMOs."" Foods produced using biotechnology have been consumed widely for nearly 20 years, with no evidence of any harm to health found, including in pregnant women and children. In addition, scientific research has shown foods produced through biotechnology to be as safe and healthful as their counterparts.                Purdue University Sees What a ""Ban"" on GMOs Would Look Like [INFOGRAPHIC]   Purdue University, published a study in AgBioForum that aimed to answer a simple question: What would the world look like without genetically engineered crops? They answered the question with my personal favorite discipline: economics. Heres a snapshot of what they found.             Biotech Foods are Safe. Says Who? [INFOGRAPHIC]   Biotech foods ('GMOs') are safe. Period. That may seem like a bold statement, but it comes with the weight of a huge body of research and global consensus among preeminent health organizations. To understand the safety of food biotech, it helps to look at the numbers. There are thousands of studies on biotech crops published, billions of pounds of biotech foods eaten, and there are zero illnesses (human or animal)resulting of consuming biotech foods.                Then vs. Now: Our Favorite Foods Before and After Genetic Modification   It seems like everyone is jumping on the ""non-GMO"" bandwagon these days. ButI'd bet a lot of people havent stopped to consider that virtually all their favorite natural foods are still the result of genetic modification that has been happening for thousands of years. These breeding practices have worked to bring us some delicious and highly nutritious foods by selectively breeding for desirable traits. But where did these foods get their starts? Lets take a look.             Food Biotechnology Videos   Technologies, such as food biotechnology, have become an important part of agriculture. However, many myths and misperceptions about food biotechnology have led to questions about its safety and benefits for the public. The video segments below were developed to help clarify the facts on food produced through biotechnology and to address some of your most common questions. In the videos, physicians who are leaders in their field discuss the following topics as they relate to food biotechnology: Safety; Allergies; Children; Benefits; and Labeling. These physicians have relevant background in these areas, as well as knowledge of the safety and health research around food biotechnology."

Healthy Eating During Pregnancy,http://www.foodinsight.org/healthy-eating-pregnancy-nutrients-weight-gain-food-safety,"A healthy eating pattern is very important during pregnancy. Good nutrition plays a key role in the health of both mother and baby. As a mom-to-be, you have higher nutrient needs than you did before conception. Yet the general principles of good nutritionvariety, balance, and moderationstill apply during pregnancy.   This resource will help you learn how to eat healthy during pregnancy. This includes how to choose a variety of healthy foods, maintain healthy weight gain during pregnancy, and stay food-safe.     Click here to download          A Balanced DietWhat a Mom-to-Be Needs    Eating a balanced diet before, during, and after pregnancy is one part of good health. This section covers the key nutrients pregnant women need and where to find them.   Calories   Calorie (aka energy for the body) needs increase during pregnancy. But eating for two only requires an additional 340 calories during the second trimester and 500 calories in the third trimester. The first trimester does not require any extra calories.   Choose foods and beverages that are nutrient-dense. This means that they good sources of the building blocks your body needs. Nutrient-dense foods are full of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. Eat variety of foods from all five food groups. These include grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy, and meat and beans. This will ensure that you and your growing baby are getting the nutrients you both need.   Your nutrient and calorie needs are higher if you are carrying more than one baby. Discuss what and how much to eat with your health care provider.     Key Nutrients     Protein   Protein helps maintain muscle and body tissue. It is also key for a babys growth  especially during the second and third trimesters. Most pregnant women should take in about 70 grams of protein every day to meet their minimum needs. Keep in mind you may need more than that. Protein requirements vary based on weight and activity level. Talk to your health care provider if you have questions about your daily protein intake. Lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and legumes (beans) are good sources of protein. These foods also supply iron, B vitamins, and other important nutrients. Dried beans, lentils, nuts, and soy products like tofu are other good sources of protein.   If you are vegetarian, you can meet your protein needs by eating foods that are complete protein sources. A complete protein has all the essential building blocks (amino acids) your body needs. Each day, eat a variety of protein sources to provide your body with essential amino acids. Vegetarian protein options include beans, milk, yogurt, eggs, and soy products. Greek yogurt is another great option. It has twice the amount of protein when compared to regular yogurt. Pregnant vegans are able to meet their protein needs from soy, a complete protein source. Sources of soy protein include soy milk, soy cheese, soy yogurt, tofu, and tempeh. Examples of other protein-rich vegan foods are nuts and beans (red kidney beans, chickpeas, black beans, etc.).   Carbohydrates   Carbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body. Fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products contain carbohydrates. Whole grains are an important source of nutrients, such as dietary fiber. They also provide a variety of health benefits. Other important carbohydrate foods include enriched refined grains. These grains have the added benefit of iron and folic acid, two essential nutrients for the babys development. Many carbohydrate foods are great choices for breakfast. Including English muffins, yogurt, bagels, cereals, breads, and fruits. Other carbohydrate-containing choices for meals or snacks include crackers, bread, and pasta.   Aim to get the majority of your daily calories from carbohydrates. For most people, carbohydrates should make up about 45 to 65 percent of daily calorie intake. Most pregnant and breastfeeding women need about 175-210 grams of carbohydrates per day.   Fats     Fat is key for good nutrition, health, and storage of many important vitamins. Like carbohydrates and protein, dietary fat is an important source of energy for the body. Certain foods that contain fat supply the body with essential fatty acids. Essential fatty acids are fats that the body does not make, so they should be included in the diet. Most importantly, essential fatty acids are critical for the babys growth and development.   Health experts recommend keeping total fat intake between 20 and 35 percent of total calories. Most fats should come from unsaturated sources. Sources of unsaturated fat include fish, vegetable oils (canola, soybean, olive, peanut, safflower, and sunflower oils), nuts, and flaxseeds. All women, including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should follow these recommendations.   DHA is an unsaturated fat that is important for babies brain and eye development. Pregnant women should aim to get 200 mg of DHA per day. Oily fish such as salmon and tuna contain DHA. For example, a serving of salmon (3.5 ozor roughly the size of a deck of cards) has over 1g of DHA. This is five times the recommended amount. A health care provider may recommend a dietary supplement or prenatal vitamin with DHA. For more information on eating fish during pregnancy, see the Food Safety section.   Calcium   Calcium is important for the growth of strong bones and teeth. Calcium intake is necessary for all women. Especially pregnant women younger than 25 years old whose bones are still growing.   Pregnant women should aim to consume 1,000 mg of calcium per day. This is about three servings of calcium-rich foods. Women 18 years and younger need 1,300 mg per day, or four servings of foods high in calcium. Many women do not get enough calcium, so it is important to focus on calcium-rich foods. Women who do not consume dairy products should consider a calcium supplement or a multivitamin.   Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese are good sources of calcium. Non-fat (skim) and low-fat (1%) dairy have equal amounts of calcium and fewer calories than higher fat (2% and whole) dairy.   Other sources of calcium include dark green, leafy vegetables, dried beans and peas, nuts and seeds, and sardines. Calcium-fortified foods and beverages are also good sources of calcium. These include some orange juices, soy milk, tofu, almond milk, and breakfast cereals. It is easiest to meet your calcium needs through dairy foods. If you are vegan, have lactose intolerance, or a milk allergy, ask your health care provider how to consume enough calcium.   Pregnant women should not consume raw (unpasteurized) milk or eat foods that contain raw milk. Raw milk can increase the risk of very dangerous foodborne illnesses, including listeriosis. For more information, see the Food Safety section of this resource.   Vitamin D   Vitamin D is important for calcium absorption, immune function and brain health. Sunlight is one source of Vitamin D. About five to ten minutes of sunlight to exposed arms or the face can supply a days worth of Vitamin D. These times can vary depending on your geographical location and skin color. Aim for fifty mcg, or 2,000 IUs, of Vitamin D per day. This goal can be met with a multivitamin. Milk or yogurt with added Vitamin D can help you meet your daily needs. Oily fish, mushrooms, fortified cereals, and dietary supplements also contain vitamin D.   Iron   Iron carries oxygen through the blood and delivers it throughout the body. It also aids in immunity, brain development, and metabolism. About 90 percent of the iron in the body is recycled every day. The growing baby also stores enough iron to last through the first few months of life.   Pregnant women have an increased amount of blood in their bodies so they need more iron than non-pregnant women. Pregnant women should aim for a total of 45 mg of iron per day from foods and dietary supplements. Animal products, including red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs, are rich in iron. Other options include enriched and whole grain breads, cereals, and pasta. Green leafy vegetables, beans, nuts, eggs, and dried fruits are also a good source.   The type of iron found in animal products is different from the iron found in plant sources. The body does not absorb the iron in plant sources as well as the iron in meat, fish, and poultry. But iron absorption can increase when eaten with foods high in vitamin C (like orange juice or red bell peppers). A registered dietitian can recommend iron-rich foods and foods that can help with iron absorption.   Many women enter pregnancy with low iron reserves. Your health care provider may recommend iron supplementation starting at the first prenatal visit. Some women may also need screening for iron deficiency on an ongoing basis. Take iron supplements between meals, with water or juice, and not with other supplements. Substances in coffee, tea, and milk can inhibit iron absorption. Taking iron supplements at bedtime may help reduce upset stomach and/or heartburn.   Folic Acid/Folate/Vitamin B 9   Folic acid, a B vitamin needed to help the baby grow, is key before and throughout pregnancy. Folic acid reduces the risk of spina bifida and other birth defects of the brain and spinal cord, which are also called neural tube defects (NTDs). Folate is the term for the different forms of the nutrient found naturally in foods. Folic acid is the form used in supplements and in enriched grain products.   Enriched bread, flour, pasta, rice, cereals, and other grain products are common food sources of folic acid. To see if your food contains folic acid, check food labels to see if the food contains folic acid or folate.   Any woman planning to become pregnant should consume 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily to help prevent birth defects. This is along with eating foods that contain folate. Women who have had a baby with NTD in the past should take 4 mg per day of folic acid before getting pregnant again.   There are many ways to meet your folate/folic acid needs. First, take a multivitamin with folic acid. Also, be sure to eat lots of fruits and vegetables, enriched grain products, legumes (such as peanuts), citrus fruits and juices.      Other Food Ingredients     Caffeine   Coffee, tea, energy drinks, some soft drinks, chocolate, and some over-the-counter medications contain caffeine. Pregnant or not, it is important to estimate your total caffeine intake from all sources. Caffeine from foods and beverages is able to cross the placenta and becomes part of breast milk. Yet, most research finds that pregnant and nursing mothers can consume moderate amounts of caffeine safely. Moderate caffeine intake during pregnancy is about 200 mg/day, which is equal to about two 8-ounce cups of coffee or four cups of tea a day. A 12-ounce caffeinated soft drink contains about 37 mg of caffeine, while an 8-ounce energy drink has about 100 mg. It is important to read the food labels on foods and beverages to be aware of how much caffeine they contain.   Some women may have heard about a link between caffeine and miscarriage. There have been many studies on whether caffeine increases miscarriage risk. Yet the results are unclear. Leading health expertsagree that200 mg caffeine perday or less during pregnancy is safe. Talk to your health care provider about your caffeine intake if you have a history of heart problems or high blood pressure.   Low-calorie sweeteners    Low-calorie sweeteners are safe for the general public, including pregnant women. The FDA and other leading authorities affirm their safety. Eight low-calorie sweeteners allowed for use in foods and as tabletop sweeteners. They are acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), advantame, aspartame, neotame, saccharin, sucralose, monk fruit extract, and stevia leaf extract. Studies show that they are all safe to consume during pregnancy.   Anyone with phenylketonuria (PKU) must restrict their intake of phenylalanine from all sources. This includes aspartame. PKU is a genetic disorder that prevents the breakdown of phenylalanine. Phenylanine is present in aspartame and many other foods. Pregnant women who have the PKU gene but not the PKU disorder can digest aspartame safely.   Sodium   Sodium is a very important, natural part of fluids in the human body. Sodium works with other minerals to keep water balance in the body. It is also critical for a healthy nervous system and muscle coordination.   Sodium needs and limits for pregnant women are not different from the general population. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium intake to 2,300 mg or less per day. Excessive sodium intake has been linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and other health conditions.      Other Nutrition Sources   Vitamin/Mineral Supplements   A balanced diet meets most nutrient needs. Still, your health care provider may recommend you take a daily multivitamin as well. These can also be helpful if you plan to become pregnant. Taken a few months before conception, an over-the-counter prenatal vitamin may help resolve any nutritional deficiencies.   More vitamin and/or mineral supplementation may be important for certain groups. For example, you may need to supplement your diet if you are a strict vegan or follow a restrictive diet. Additional supplementation may also be beneficial if you are carrying twins or triplets. Consider taking a calcium supplement (600 milligrams per day) plus Vitamin D if you are a vegan, are under 25, or do not consume dairy. Also, vitamin B12 supplements (and perhaps vitamin D and zinc) for strict vegans.   Pregnant women should not take Vitamin A supplements. Excessive levels of Vitamin A could be toxic to the developing baby. You can meet your vitamin A needs with a healthful diet and a prenatal multivitamin.   Herbal and Botanical Supplements   There is no scientific evidence to support benefits from herbal and botanical products during pregnancy. In fact, some herbal products may have serious side effects for both mom and baby. For these reasons, pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid herbal and botanical supplements.   Alcohol and Pregnancy   Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause permanent physical, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities. Do not consume alcohol during pregnancy. Also, women who are trying to get pregnant should not drink alcohol. Many women do not know they are pregnant until they are four to six weeks into the pregnancy. Drinking even small amounts during this time could expose their developing baby to alcohol. Women should stop drinking alcohol as soon as they find out they are pregnant.     Weight Gain during Pregnancy     It is important to track your weight gain during pregnancy. This helps to make sure that both you and your baby are healthy. Women who gain too little weight are at risk of having a small baby (less than 5 1/2 pounds). Yet women who gain too much weight have a greater risk of having the baby early or having a large baby. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also lead to other health problems. These may include gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and varicose veins in the mother.   Pregnant women store fat to prepare for breastfeeding. If you are below your target pregnancy weight, your health care provider will carefully track your progress. Also, ask your health care provider or a registered dietitian to help with meal planning. This will help ensure that you get the nutrients and calories you need for proper weight gain.   Goals for Weight Gain   Weight gain goals are based on pre-pregnancy weight, height, age, and usual eating patterns. Every woman and every pregnancy is unique. Your healthcare provider can help you gain weight at a healthy rate throughout pregnancy.   A weight gain of 25 to 35 pounds is normal for women with a body mass index, or BMI, of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 (""normal weight""). BMI is one way to determine if you are at an appropriate weight. This tool can determine how much weight you should gain during pregnancy. Women who are below healthy weight when they conceive (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) should aim to gain about 28 to 40 pounds. Women with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 (""overweight"") should gain no more than 15 to 25 pounds. Go to  http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/  to calculate your individual BMI.   Women with a BMI over 30 kg/m2 (""obese"") should gain no more than 11 to 20 pounds. If you are in this category, a health care provider or registered dietitian can help you meet these recommendations in a healthy way. Aim to meet your calorie and nutrient needs, while maintaining regular physical activity. Weight loss during pregnancy is not advised.   If you are carrying more than one baby, weight gain recommendations increase. Women with a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 should gain 37-54 pounds. Women with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 should gain 31-50 pounds. Women with a BMI over 30 kg/m2 should aim to gain 25-42 pounds. There are no set guidelines for weight gain for underweight (BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2) women carrying more than one baby. Work closely with your health care provider to ensure proper weight gain.   Pattern of Weight Gain   Patterns of weight gain during pregnancy are as important as total weight gain. Your health care provider will keep records of your height and weight starting on the first prenatal visit. Regular weigh-ins will be recorded at each visit to make sure you are gaining weight at the proper rate.   Weight maintenance or slight weight losses are normal during the first trimester (or first 13 weeks) of pregnancy. But most women should expect to gain about four to five pounds during the first trimester. Weight gain should come from the nutrient-rich foods described earlier in this resource. Listen to your bodys signals and stop eating when you feel full. This will help keep you from overeating because youre eating for two.   Women with healthy pre-pregnancy weights should gain about one pound a week during the second and third trimesters. Women who are underweight before conception should gain a little more than one pound per week. Those who were initially overweight should gain at a slower rate (a little more than a half a pound per week).   Food Cravings and Aversions   Food cravings and dislikes of certain foods are common during pregnancy. There is no evidence that food cravings are linked to nutritional deficiencies. Their cause remains a mystery. It is acceptable to meet your food cravings within reason. Especially when they supply nutrients to the diet.   In rare cases, some pregnant women crave nonfood substances. This is a disorder called pica. The consumption of nonfood items can be dangerous for both mother and baby. In some cases, pica involves eating large amounts of nonfood. This can prevent you from getting enough calories or nutrients to stay healthy. Examples of these nonfood items include clay, starch, ice, coffee grounds, or baking soda. If you experience nonfood cravings, talk to your health care provider right away. These symptoms may be a sign of nutrient deficiency (such as Iron), and may need to be treated with an additional supplement.   Physical Activity   Physical activity is another critical part of good health. Include 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity on most, if not all, days of the week. Try activities like walking or swimming. But avoid activities that have a high risk of falling or injury. If you already do vigorous activities (like running), you can continue them throughout your pregnancy. Discuss adjustments to the activity with your health care provider. Some women cannot fit 30 minutes of one time at one time into their schedules. Feel free to split up the time into three 10-minute intervals throughout the day.     Being Smart About Food Safety    Food safety is important for everyone. There are certain foods that pose an extra risk to pregnant women and their unborn babies. In particular, pregnant women should be aware of their increased risk of listeriosis.   Listeriosis    Listeriosis is a dangerous infection caused by bacteria often found in soil, ground water, and on plants. Refrigerated, ready-to-eat foods such as meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy may contain listeria. Also, unpasteurized (raw) milk and products made with raw milk may contain these bacteria. Listeria can be dangerous for pregnant women and their unborn babies. Listeriosis, the infection caused by listeria, can cause many dangers for mother and baby. These include premature delivery, miscarriage, fetal death, and severe illness of the newborn.   Symptoms of listeriosis can take a few days or even weeks to appear and can be mild. You may not even know you have listeriosis. This makes practicing proper food safety even more critical. Listeriosis can have flu-like symptoms at first. These include sudden onset of fever, chills, muscle aches, diarrhea, and/or upset stomach. Other symptoms could include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions. A blood test can determine if you have listeriosis, and it can be treated with antibiotics. This can also prevent the fetus from contracting the infection.   Avoid  certain foods during pregnancy to prevent listeriosis. These include:   Hot dogs, luncheon or deli meats, unless they are reheated until steaming hot.   Soft cheeses such as feta, Brie, Camembert, and blue-veined cheese   Soft Mexican-style cheeses (queso blanco fresco). Unless they are labeled as made with pasteurized milk.   Deli salads such as ham salad, chicken salad, egg salad, tuna salad, or seafood salad.   Refrigerated meat-based pt or spreads.   Refrigerated smoked seafood, unless it is an ingredient in a cooked dish such as a casserole.   Raw (unpasteurized) milk or foods that contain unpasteurized milk.   Mercury in Fish   Fish contains high-quality protein and other essential nutrients. It is also low in saturated fat, and contains healthy omega-3 fats. These fats contribute to heart health, brain development and childrens proper growth and development. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines encourage pregnant and breastfeeding women to eat a 2-3 meals (8-12 ounces) of seafood each week.   All popular types of fish in the U.S. are healthy, low in mercury and safe to eat during pregnancy. These include salmon, tuna (light canned), and tilapia. All seafood contains trace (very, very small) amounts of mercury. But only four types of fish should be avoided during pregnancy due to their mercury content. These higher-mercury fish are tilefish, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel.     Conclusion   Food has a big role in maintaining the health of both mothers and their babies. Practice good nutrition and food safety habits during pregnancy. These can have lifelong benefits for you and your child. Eat a mix of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, lean meats, and beans. All food groups provide essential nutrients to your diet. Also, remember that certain foods may pose health risks to the mother and unborn baby. Choose foods based on the principles of balance, variety, and moderation. This is the best approach to enjoying a healthy eating plan during pregnancy and for a lifetime.

Everything You Need to Know About Stevia Sweeteners,http://www.foodinsight.org/Everything_You_Need_to_Know_About_Stevia_Sweeteners,"Favorably reviewed by the  American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA)   Download the  PDF  to view the brochure   Many people may think they have to give up sweets in order to lose or maintain their weight. However, low-calorie sweeteners such as stevia sweeteners offer a way to reduce calories in sweet tasting foods and beverages, which may help you manage your weight. They also offer a way for people with diabetes to decrease overall carbohydrate intake.   One commonly consumed low-calorie sweetener is stevia. The following is everything you need to know about stevia sweeteners, including facts about nutrition, safety, uses, and benefits.   Everything You Need to Know About Stevia Sweeteners   Many people may think they have to give up sweets in order to lose or maintain their weight. However, low-calorie sweeteners such as stevia sweeteners offer a way to reduce calories in sweet tasting foods and beverages, which may help you manage your weight. They also offer a way for people with diabetes to decrease overall carbohydrate intake.   Read on to learn everything you need to know about stevia sweeteners, including facts about nutrition, safety, uses, and benefits.   What are stevia sweeteners?   Highly purified stevia sweeteners (which we will refer to as stevia sweeteners) are a natural, no-calorie source of sweetness. They are composed of extracts known as highly purified steviol glycosides, which are taken from the sweetest part of the stevia plant. Like other low-calorie sweeteners, they are intense sweeteners  200-300 times sweeter than sugar  meaning a very small amount provides a lot of sweetness.   Stevia sweeteners have a long history of safe use in many countries around the world. The stevia plant is native to South America. Today it can be found growing in many countries, including China, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, India, and South Korea. Hundreds of foods and beverages, such as certain juice and tea beverages, throughout the world are sweetened with stevia sweeteners. They are also available in tabletop sweetener products.   Before 2008, stevia sweeteners were not permitted in foods and beverages in the U.S. Since then, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has reviewed published research and experts conclusions about safety for several stevia sweeteners. FDA has raised no questions about the conclusions that these ingredients are Generally Recognized as Safe, or GRAS (see sidebar, What is GRAS?) As a result, foods and beverages containing stevia sweeteners are now available in the U.S.   How many calories are in stevia sweeteners?   Stevia sweeteners contain no calories. However, some products containing stevia sweeteners may contain other ingredients that have calories. These other ingredients may be used to provide the best flavor or texture. Typically, the amount of these other ingredients is very small, making the total calorie content very low. As a result, products containing stevia sweeteners may be labeled light or reduced calorie. Check the label for calorie information and for the presence of stevia sweeteners.   How do stevia sweeteners fit into a healthful diet?   Stevia sweeteners and other low-calorie sweeteners add sweetness to foods and beverages without adding a significant amount of calories. Therefore, stevia sweeteners can expand food choices for people who want to consume fewer calories.   Are stevia sweeteners safe?   Yes. Many government authorities around the world have concluded that stevia sweeteners are safe for the general population, including children, people with diabetes, and women who are pregnant or nursing. Stevia sweeteners are permitted for use in many countries, including the European Union, Japan, China, Australia, Brazil, and the U.S. In the U.S., stevia sweeteners are GRAS, based on published research and expert opinions that have been reviewed by the FDA.   What is GRAS?   Food ingredients permitted for use in the U.S. fall into one of two categories: food additives (which require review and prior approval from the FDA) or Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) ingredients.   Whether GRAS or a food additive, food ingredients must be safe. To be considered GRAS, an ingredient must meet one of the following two conditions:   A history of safe use has been established and a significant number of people consumed the ingredient prior to the enactment of the Food Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1958; or   Scientific data and information about the safety and use of the ingredient are widely known and publicly available in scientific articles, position papers, etc., with consensus among scientific experts that the ingredient is safe for its intended use.   Global Safety Recognition of Stevia Sweeteners   Stevia sweeteners are permitted for use in foods and beverages in countries around the globe. Government and scientific groups that have concluded that stevia sweeteners are safe include:   U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)   European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)   Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/World Health Organization (WHO) Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA)   Food Standards Australia/New Zealand (FSANZ)   French Agency for Food, Environmental, and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES)   Can people who have diabetes consume foods and beverages containing stevia sweeteners?   Yes. Stevia and other low-calorie sweeteners provide sweet-tasting, low-carbohydrate options for people with diabetes. Research shows that consuming stevia sweeteners does not increase blood glucose levels. Of course, a product containing stevia may still contain carbohydrates and calories. Therefore, always check the food label. If you have diabetes, a health professional, registered dietitian (RD) and/or certified diabetes educator (CDE) can work with you and your doctor to understand how foods and beverages containing stevia sweeteners fit into your diet.   Are stevia sweeteners safe for children?   Yes. Stevia sweeteners are safe and useful options for children and adolescents, and can be included as part of a balanced diet rich in nutrients. Incorporating some low-calorie, sugar-free foods and beverages into meals and snacks is one way to avoid consuming excess calories. Health professionals, including registered dietitians (RD), can help parents make the best choices based on their childs individual calorie and nutrition needs.   Can pregnant and breastfeeding women consume stevia sweeteners?   Yes. Research has shown that stevia sweeteners are safe for expecting or nursing mothers when consumed as part of a healthful diet. For women who consume foods and beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners, talk to your doctor or RD about consuming the necessary calories and nutrients for your babys growth.   Do stevia sweeteners cause weight gain?   No. Stevia sweeteners are low in calories and do not cause increased weight, appetite or preference for sweet tasting foods. Using low-calorie sweeteners in place of those with calories, such as sugar, can help you to consume fewer calories overall, helping you stay within your calorie budget. In other words, they help you to maintain your weight by balancing the calories you eat and drink with the calories you burn through physical activity and other day to day tasks. If weight loss is desired, then the calories you eat and drink must be less than the calories you burn.   A few researchers have suggested that consuming low-calorie sweeteners could lead people to eat more, causing weight gain. However, most experts agree that the current body of research does not support this idea and that low-calorie sweeteners can be effective in aiding weight loss or weight management. A few studies suggesting that low-calorie sweeteners were linked to increased appetite and preference for sweet tasting foods were small and limited in their application, and the larger body of research does not show a link. According to several scientific studies, low-calorie sweeteners do not cause people to feel hungrier or to eat more. In fact, low-calorie sweeteners such as stevia help to provide people who are trying to lose weight a greater variety of low-calorie food choices.

Is Spirulina the New Green Superfood or Just a Nutritionally Dense Algae?,http://www.foodinsight.org/spirulina-health-benefits-side-effects-myths,"New Year, new superfood! And this year, were discussing the super green food spirulina. Whats  spirulina , you ask? Its a blue-green algae that grows in the ocean and has been used as a nutritional supplement in recent years. Along with its nutritional benefits, there are other super(inflated) claims out there. But does spirulina get the green light when it comes to its health benefits, or is there a cautionary blinking yellow light in the distance?   Before I go into the claims, lets sort out the facts. Spirulina is actually nutritionally dense, meaning that there are quite a bit of nutrients in a small amount of calories.  A tablespoon  contains only 20 calories, but offers 4g of protein and 11 percent of your daily recommended iron intake. So if youre trying to find ways to boost protein in your diet or if youre anemic (like myself), a spoonful a day can go a long way. It also contains magnesium, potassium, and folate, and its been  approved by the FDA for use as a natural food coloring agent  to give foodssuch as ice cream, desserts, yogurts, and ready-to-eat cereala beautiful blue/green color.   And ... thats it! Yup, those are the facts, just the nutritional data. Outside of its nutritional content,  spirulina has been the subject of some pretty lofty, unscientific claims . A quick search of the internetand youll see claims that it can benefit those with allergies, depression, diabetes, and even AIDS. Unfortunately, the science is out on this. Some are claims with no scientific evidence, and others have a study, but one that wasn't done well.   There areother claims about it detoxing, even to the point of removing bacteria in the blood, which seems a little far-fetched. I might be convinced to believe this  if it were a real thing. But as weve discussed before,  you dont need to detox  if you have normallyfunctioning liver and kidneysand if you have bacteria in your blood, also known as  septicemia , you would be in the ICU.    Spirulina is sold in tablet, capsule, or powder form. Because contamination is a serious concern, consider buying it from a reputable seller. Also, there are  warnings  that women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should avoid it, as well as those with  phenylketonuria  (PKU), a rare inherited disorder that causes phenylalanine, an amino acid, to build up in the body. And one more thing:It can interact with medications, so consult your doctor if you plan to use it.   Spirulina does have some nutritional benefits, but outside of that, the otherclaims don't have much weight. And with more than a few concerns about contamination and drug interactions, for some, it may be better to give spirulina the red light."
4 Common Foodborne Illnesses That You've Never Heard Of,http://www.foodinsight.org/foodborne-illness-norovirus-Clostridium-Perfringens-Campylobacter-Listeria-Monocytogenes,"Dont eat raw cookie dough or youll get salmonella, is something my mom consistently told me growing up, and Im sure you have probably heard that too at one point or another. Most people are familiar with  Salmonella  and  E. coli , but there are numerous other foodborne illnesses that arent as well known, but still very common. The Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  estimates  that 1 in 6 Americans get sick from some sort of foodborne illness each year. To avoid being one of these six, here are four lesser known, but still common foodborne illness and ways to prevent them.   Norovirus   According to the CDC, the  norovirus  is the leading cause of disease outbreaks from contaminated food in America. Leafy greens, fresh fruits, and shellfish are foods that are often involved in these outbreaks. To lessen the chance of getting norovirus, make sure you are washing fruits and vegetables thoroughly, washing your hands before and after you touch food, and cooking seafood to an internal temperature of 145F. But I can only get norovirus in the winter right? Not true. Your chances of getting norovirus in the winter are higher due to the increased amount of time people spend indoors, which facilitates the spread of germs. Be vigilant about hygiene during every season!   Clostridium Perfringens   Often associated with cafeterias and buffets,  Clostridium perfringens  is commonly found in foods that are prepared in large quantities and kept warm for long period of time: raw meat and poultry, stews, casseroles, and gravies to name a few. My former roommate used to put  everything  in the microwave to keep it warm. Casseroles, lasagna, dumplings you name it; it was probably sitting in the microwave. This is a breeding ground for foodborne diseases like  C. perfringens . Perishable foods need to be held at over 140F or put in the fridge within two hours of sitting out. Large batches of food should be separated into small quantities for refrigeration, and it should be reheated to at least 165F.   Campylobacter   Raw and undercooked poultry, unpasteurized milk, contaminated water, and fresh produce are the foods more commonly associated with  Campylobacter  outbreaks. To avoid these outbreaks, cook poultry to an internal temperature of 165F, wash hands before and after touching raw meat, avoid drinking unpasteurized milk, wash fruits and vegetables, and always use clean cutting boards. Despite what you may think,  Campylobacter  cannot survive ambient conditions. Cleaners and disinfectants easily destroy the bacteria. So, simple hygienic measures are the best way of eliminating the spread of  Campylobacter .   Listeria Monocytogenes   Listeria monocytogenes  most commonly affects people with weak immune systems like older adults, newborns and  pregnant women . Uncooked meats, unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses (like Brie and feta), ready-to-eat deli meats, and hot dogs are regularly involved with  Listeria  outbreaks. Okay, prevention on this is pretty easy: dont eat unpasteurized cheese or drink unpasteurized milk and follow the other food safety tips weve reviewed. Wash your hands, knives, countertops, and produce, thoroughly cook raw meats, and keep them away from other foods. Consume perishable and ready-to-eat foods as soon as possible. What should you do when they expire? Freezing them will probably kill harmful bacteria, right? False.  Listeria  is a foodborne pathogens that can survive for a long period of time at freezing temperatures, so make sure you freeze foods before they expire.   So, youre basically a food safety expert now! Foodborne illnesses can be deadly, and at the very least cause nausea, abdominal cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea. If youve never experienced it, take it from me (PS - never eat gas station sushi). But in all seriousness, preventing foodborne illnesses can be easy if you practice safe food handling and take heed to our words of wisdom."
2013 Food and Health Survey,http://www.foodinsight.org/articles/2013-food-and-health-survey,"The International Food Information Council Foundations 2013 Food & Health Survey examines Americans diet, food safety practices and healthy habits.   Americans Experience a Control Gap Regarding Their Weight, Diet and Activity Level    But, they recognize room for improvement and opportunities to do better.     The 2013 Food & Health Survey: Consumer Attitudes toward Food Safety, Nutrition & Health , commissioned by the International Food Information Council Foundation, is the eighth annual national quantitative study designed to gain insights from Americans on important food safety, nutrition and health-related topics.   The research provides the opportunity to better understand how Americans view their own diets in relation to others, their efforts to improve them, how they balance diet and exercise, their knowledge of food ingredients and components, their beliefs when it comes to food safety, and their behaviors across all of these fronts.    The International Food Information Council Foundation  2013 Food & Health Survey  was conducted by Mathew Greenwald & Associates of Washington, D.C. This 28 minute, web-based survey was fielded in April 2013. The survey respondents were reflective of the demographics of the U.S. population, and while the sample was very close to the target demographics, the data were weighted to match the demographics of the U.S. population. This year, the weighting adjustments were very minor.   This  Survey  offers the important voice and insights of the consumer for health professionals, government officials, educators and other interested individuals who seek to improve the lives and health of Americans.    The vast majority of Americans believe its possible to have a great deal of control over their level of physical activity, the healthfulness of their diet and their weight, yet far fewer are actually taking that control. Ninety percent of consumers say its possible to have a great deal or complete control over their physical activity, yet only 65 percent are actually trying to take that same amount of control in their own livesa 25-point control gap. In terms of the healthfulness of their diet, there is a 20-point gap (88% versus 68%), and regarding their weight, the gap is 16 points (81% versus 65%). This indicates that there are barriers preventing people from taking more control of their physical activity, diet and weight. A lack of willpower (64 percent), the dislike of exercise (60%), the perceived high cost of healthful food (54%), and slow progress (51%) are barriers that prevent Americans from taking greater control over their weight.    On the other hand, when asked about other factors such as their happiness, physical attractiveness, the  amount of money  they make, and the safety of the foods and beverages they consume, the gap vanishes. Americans are taking at least as much or more control in these areas of their own lives than they believe is actually possible.    When asked to assign a letter grade on a grade scale form A to F to their own diet and physical activity, consumers gave themselves an average grade of C-plus for their level of physical activity. They grade their personal diets slightly higher with an average grade of B-minus. While Americans acknowledge that there is room for improvement in their diet, they believe they are doing a full letter grade better than other Americans. They rated the diet of the average American at C-minus. In order to improve the grade of their own diets, Americans think they should consume a more balanced diet in general, including eating more fruits and vegetables and fewer sweets and snacks.     This year, consumers were asked if they agreed that they would rather lose $1000 than gain 20 pounds, and slightly more than half of Americans (56%) agreed with the statement either somewhat or strongly. Women were more likely than men, and, predictably, those with higher household incomes were more likely to agree.

The majority (62%) report that their health is either excellent or very good, and only nine percent report that they are in fair or poor health. Despite their belief that they are in good health, many Americans recognize there is room to improve their diet, with only twelve percent giving the healthfulness of their diet a grade of A or A-minus. The average grade that Americans give to their own diet is B-minus. While they recognize that their diets are not perfect, Americans do tend to believe the healthfulness of their diet is better than that of the average American. When asked what grade they would provide the healthfulness of the average Americans diet, the average grade was C-minus, a full letter grade lower than their own diets.   Eating a more balanced diet generallymore fruits and vegetables and fewer sweets in particularis the most common way Americans would improve their diets to earn a better grade. In fact, the majority of Americans (88%) have made efforts to eat more fruits and vegetables. Thirty-three percent have begun the efforts within the past year, and 56 percent have been trying to do it for more than a year. Other efforts Americans are attempting include: cut calories by drinking water, low- and no-calorie beverages (82%), eating more foods with whole grains (78%), cutting back on foods higher in added sugar (75%), consuming smaller portions (73%), cutting back on foods higher in salt (70%), cutting back on foods higher in solid fats (66%), comparing sodium in foods like soup, bread, and frozen meals and choosing the foods with lower numbers (60%), cutting back on full-fat dairy and replace with low- or no-fat alternative (60%), and balancing calories to manage my weight (54%). Women, older Americans and those with a college education are most likely to be performing these actions than their counterparts.   Weight Management:   More than half of Americans (56%) report that they are trying to lose weight. Twenty-seven percent indicate they are trying to maintain their weight, a significant increase from 2012 (22%). These numbers indicate that more Americans are consciously trying to do at least something regarding their weight, with only 15 percent reporting that they are not doing anything regarding their weight, a significant decrease from 2012 (20%).   Calories and Energy Balance:   The majority of Americans think about the number of calories they consume at least sometimes (69%), and twenty percent rarely think about them. Only ten percent report that they never think about the calories they consume. Of the nine out of ten Americans who think about calories at all, most would find it at least somewhat helpful in their efforts to keep track of how many calories they consume if calories were shown on menus, the fronts and backs of packaging and/or listed in recipes. Those who more frequently think about calories are more likely to perceive these tools and methods of presentation as very helpful.   As in previous years, when it comes to calories, only three in ten Americans (30%) correctly believe that all sources of calories play an equal role in weight gain. Twenty-one percent believe calories from sugars are most likely to cause weight gain, and nineteen percent believe that calories from carbohydrates are most likely to cause weight gainconsistent with 2012. Eighteen percent believe it is calories from fats that are most likely to cause weight gain, while only one percent believes that calories from protein are most likely to cause weight gain.   Physical Activity:   The vast majority of Americans (96%) have given at least a little thought to the amount of physical activity they get, with sixty percent reporting that they have given a lot of thought to the issue.   Americans tend to grade their activity level about as highly as their diet. The average grade Americans would give to their physical activity level is C-plus.       Sustainability:   One in five Americans report that they have given a lot of thought to whether foods and beverages they purchase or consume are produced in a sustainable way, and forty-four percent have given the issue a little thought. When asked what actions they do on a regular basis, about one-third (36%) say they purchase foods and beverages because they are advertised as natural on the label. Nearly one-quarter of Americans report buying food and beverages because they are advertised as organic on the label (27%). Fewer report regularly buying foods or beverages because they are in recycled and/or recyclable packaging (18%), and buying foods and beverages because they are advertised as green or eco-friendly on the label (17%).   Protein:   Nearly six out of ten Americans (57%) are trying to consume packaged foods with protein. The most common reason for eating protein is to have a balanced diet (76%), though many consume protein to maintain energy (62%), to build or maintain muscle strength (56%), and to feel full for longer and delay becoming hungry again (51%).   Fewer than half of Americans indicate that the time of day they get their protein matters to them. In particular, those Americans under the age of 65 and those with college degrees are more likely to say the time of day they consume protein does matter.   Americans believe that higher amounts of protein are especially beneficial for children under twelve (61%) and teens (73%). About half of Americans believe higher amounts of protein are especially beneficial for pregnant women (58%), men aged 20-54 (57%), and women aged 20-54 (53%). Less than half of Americans believe higher amounts of protein are especially beneficial for people aged 55 or older.   Dietary Fats:   Many Americans try to limit the amount of fats they consume. Of those monitoring their fat intake, weight and health considerations, specifically reducing the risk of heart disease, are the main reasons for monitoring fat content in food and beverage products. However, one in four do try to consume foods or beverages that contain omega-3 fats.   Despite recognizing that not all types of fat have the same impact on health, seven out of ten Americans claim they try to eat as little fat as possible (69%). Many say they are limiting or avoiding several types of fats: trans fats (49%), saturated fats (48%), and mono- and poly- unsaturated fats (25%), which are the more healthful fatty acids. Ultimately, no more than half of Americans can identify any given key source of unsaturated fats; moreover, many erroneously think sources of saturated fats have unsaturated fats.   Sodium:   Six out of ten Americans are trying to limit or avoid sodium entirely, most commonly to prevent a future health condition (69%) and to help reduce the risk of heart disease (64%). Sixty percent of Americans consider the sodium content of packaged foods and beverages because sodium plays a role in overall health.   Nearly all Americans (90%) recognize that there are multiple factors that have an impact on reducing blood pressure or keeping it from going higher, including: getting regular physical activity; losing weight; reducing or managing stress; eating a diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains and low-fat dairy; reducing salt/sodium in the diet; limiting or stopping smoking, and limiting or stopping drinking alcohol.   Fewer Americans recognize the functional role sodium plays in foods and beverages. While three-quarters of consumers know that sodium can act as a preservative in foods and beverages, less than half know that it can offset the bitterness of fruits and vegetables (47%), help prevent harmful bacteria in foods (41%), and improve the texture and firmness of foods (38%).   Carbohydrates & Sugars:   When making packaged food or beverage decisions over the past twelve months, more than half of Americans (58%) say they are trying to limit or avoid sugars. While about half (51%) indicate they are trying to limit or avoid high fructose corn syrup (HFCS), four in ten (40%) say they dont pay attention to HFCS. The majority of Americans also say they dont pay attention to complex (60%) or refined (61%) carbohydrates when making packaged food or beverage decisions. Weight management (70%) and preventing a future health condition (61%) are the most common reasons Americans are considering sugars or carbohydrates when making food purchasing decisions.   Most Americans (84%) believe that moderate amounts of sugars can be part of an overall healthful diet. More than 7 in 10 (71%) believe that people with diabetes can include some foods with sugar as part of their total diet. Additionally, a little more than half of Americans believe that it is not necessary to completely eliminate sugar from their diet in order to lose weight (55%).   Low-Calorie Sweeteners:   More than half of consumers (53%) are considering whether or not the packaged foods or beverages they purchase contain low-calorie sweeteners. For those Americans who consume low-calorie sweeteners (n=243), reducing total calories is the most common reason (68%), followed by preventing a future health condition (30%), and for a preference in taste (30%).   Increasing proportions of Americans recognize the benefits of low-calorie sweeteners and believe that they serve a variety of function. Nearly half of Americans agree that low-calorie sweeteners are an option for people with diabetes (49%), that they can reduce the calorie content of foods (47%), and that they can play a role in weight loss or weight management (45%). Older Americans (generally those age 50 or older), men, and those with a college degree are more likely to feel positive about low-calorie sweeteners.   Food Additives and Colors:   Only one in ten Americans believe that many man-made food additives have the same properties as their natural counterparts. Further, consumers are much more likely to believe the government regulates man-made food additives more than naturally occurring ones. Nearly half of Americans (45%) believe the government regulates man-made food additives a fair amount or a lot, while less than one-third (30%) believe naturally occurring food additives are regulated by the government at the same level.   Functional Foods:   Americans are aware of a number of health relationships associated with a variety of vitamins and nutrients, and other healthful components; however, there are some relationships that are more familiar than others. Americans are most familiar with the health benefits associated with fiber, whole grains, omega-3 fatty acids and probiotics. The majority of Americans is aware of the relationship between fiber and a healthy digestive system (85%) and weight management (72%), but fewer are aware of fibers associations with heart health and healthy blood sugar (52% and 43% respectively). Seven out of ten Americans are aware that omega-3s can promote heart health, but far fewer know that they can also promote cognition, immune health and eye health. Eight out of ten Americans associate whole grains with heart health, weight management and digestive system health, while six in ten connect whole grains to healthy blood sugar. Two-thirds of Americans draw a link between probiotics and a healthy digestive system. Few think they contribute to immune health.   Lesser understood nutrients include soy, prebiotics, lutein and flavonoids. One-third of Americans know that soy can promote heart health, though just as many incorrectly believe that it is associated with weight management or digestive system-health. Similarly, one-third associate prebiotics with maintaining a healthy digestive system, but one-fourth think they help with immune healthperhaps confusing them with probiotics. One out of four Americans associate lutein with eye health, and only a very small segment of Americans appear to know the benefits of flavonoids (promotion of heart health, 10%; support of blood flow, 7%).   Food Safety:   Although a large majority of Americans remain confident in the safety of the U.S. food supply, there was a significant drop in confidence from 2012 (78%) to 2013 (70%). Unsurprising, there was an increase in Americans who are not too or not at all confident. Americans are giving at least a little thought to the various elements of food safety: chemicals in food (84%), foodborne illnesses from bacteria (79%), the safety of imported foods (75%), and pesticides (75%). Fewer Americans are giving thought to animal antibiotics (56%) and undeclared allergens (43%).   More than half of Americans believe that imported foods are less safe than foods produced or grown in the USA, a significant increase from 2012 (53% in 2013 vs. 48% in 2012), while 25 percent of Americans believe imported foods are as safe, and only two percent believe they are more safe.   Health professionals (doctor, nurse, dietitian) are among the most trusted sources of food safety information, with 93 percent of Americans finding them at least somewhat trustworthy. Nearly three-quarters of Americans trust friends or family members, and about two-thirds trust the government (FDA, USDA). Less than half of Americans trust food manufacturers to deliver accurate food safety information.   Almost all Americans have heard of Salmonella on food (97%), but nearly half believe that food containing Salmonella bacteria cannot be made safe to eat (45%). Four in ten believe that cooking a food can make it safe to eat if it had Salmonella bacteria on it.   Americans are commonly taking a variety of actions to achieve food safetyespecially washing their hands and cutting boards (97% and 89% respectively). The majority are also regularly storing leftovers properly within two hours of serving the food (81%), separating raw meat, poultry and seafood from ready-to-eat or raw foods (77%), and cooking foods to the required temperature (77%). Fewer Americans are using a food thermometer to check the doneness of meat and poultry items. When it comes to encouraging food thermometer use, many Americans report that being given a free thermometer would prompt them to increase their use of a food thermometer. About half report they would be encouraged to use a food thermometer if recipes in cookbooks and on websites listed temperatures in their direction.   Information Sources and Influences:   When asked what impact various factors have on an individuals willingness to believe new information about food and health, the vast majority of Americans (91%) indicate that doing their own research has the most impact: 59 percent say it has a major impact, and 32 percent say it has a minor impact. Other factors include: hearing the information from a trusted friend or family member (87%), hearing the same information from multiple sources (86%), hearing the information from someone who has an advanced degree in health or nutrition (84%), hearing the information in the news (70%), having it just seem true (64%), hearing the same information multiple times from the same source (61%), and hearing or seeing the information on social media (29%).        Most Americans (61%) have seen the MyPlate graphic, and forty percent feel they know at least a fair amount about it. About one-third of Americans report having never seen the MyPlate graphic.   Food Labeling:   The packaging information most commonly used by American consumers is the expiration date (82%), with significantly more Americans looking at it than in past years (76% in 2012; 63% in 2011). The Nutrition Facts panel is the second most commonly used source of packaging information (67%). These two pieces of information have consistently been at the top of the information consumers seek from the food package. Roughly half of consumers report that they look at the serving size and amount per container (55%), brand name (53%), ingredients list (52%), and cooking instructions/preparation time (45%). Few Americans feel any additional information is needed on food packages.   Of those Americans who use the Nutrition Facts panel, nearly all of them find it helpful for the Nutrition Facts panel to show information on sugars (97%), calories (96%), total fat (95%), fiber (94%), sodium (93%), total carbohydrates (93%), protein (93%), saturated fat (91%), trans fat (91%), and unsaturated fat (87%).   Consumers overwhelmingly prefer to see the common names of ingredients on the food package, as opposed to the scientific name (e.g., salt instead of sodium chloride). Ninety-three percent strongly or somewhat agree that they would prefer ingredient lists to use the common name for ingredients.   Americans increasingly believe processed foods can provide various benefits. Eight in ten Americans agree that minimally processed foods can be healthful choices (up from 67% in 2012) and that food processing can help foods stay fresh longer (up from 74% in 2012). A majority of Americans also believe that some processed foods can provide affordable, nutritious options (65%) and that food processing can help improve food safety (54%).   Purchasing Influences:   Similar to past years, taste continues to drive food and beverage choices (89%), followed by price (71%), healthfulness (64%), convenience (56%) and sustainability (36%). Healthfulness and convenience, while consistent with recent years, have steadily increased since the question was first asked in 2006 (healthfulness, 58%; convenience, 48%). Older consumers are more likely to be influenced by healthfulness and sustainability and less likely to be influenced by price and convenience than are younger consumers. Women are more likely than men to be influenced by price, healthfulness and sustainability.   When making decisions about buying packaged food or beverages, at least six in ten Americans report considering calories (72%), whole grains (69%), sodium/salt (69%), fiber (68%), sugars in general (68%), and/or protein (63%).   Family Health:   Six in ten parents feel that their current lifestyle sets a healthful example for their children.   Interestingly, when asked whether they agreed that their generation is the healthiest generation in America, the majority of Americans disagreed either strongly (38%) or somewhat (37%). Only 17 percent of Americans agree that their generation is the healthiest. However, the older Americans get, the more likely they are to agree that their generation is the healthiest.   _________    The full Survey findings and additional information are available on the International Food Information Council Foundations website:  www.foodinsight.org.

Starting Solids: A Resource for Parents and Their Infants,http://www.foodinsight.org/starting-solids-infant-feeding-safety-homemade-vitamin-mineral,"You may have many questions about this important milestone. When are babies ready for solid foods? Which foods should be given? How much food is enough?   This resource provides tips for starting solid foods and keeping infants safe when they are eating. Keep in mind that each infant is different. Their diets may vary depending on things such as age, development, and nutritional needs. Ask your pediatric nurse practitioner, pediatrician, registered dietitian or other healthcare provider for more feeding advice.     Download the Resource     Newborns   Breast milk or iron-fortified infant formula provide all the nutrients and calories your infant needs for growth during the first four to six months of life. Young infants are not ready for solid foods. They are unable to safely swallow solid foods, and their stomachs are not able to digest solids well. Solid foods or thickened formula should  not  be given to help infants go longer between feedings, help them sleep through the night, or improve their nutrition.   Your infant may be ready to begin solids when:   Holds head up by self   Does not push food out of mouth with tongue   Sits up with support   4 to 6 Months   Most experts recommend starting solid foods sometime between four and six months of age. Remember, breast milk or formula is still the most important food for your infant during the first year of life. Solid foods are given only so your infant gets used to eating different textures.   Iron-rich foods, such as single-grain baby cereal or pureed meats, are good first foods to introduce. Breastfed infants especially benefit from earlier meat introduction. Your healthcare provider will advise you on what food to start first.   How to feed your infant:   If giving cereal, mix one tablespoon with 4 or 5 tablespoons of breast milk or formula   Use a small rubber coated spoon with a long handle to feed   Position your infant in a high chair sitting in front of you so you can see each others face   Place about  teaspoon of cereal or pureed food on the back of your infants tongue. This will help them suck the food off the spoon.   Start with small serving sizes: 1 to 2 small spoonfuls at a time   At first, your infant may not like the taste of solid food. Dont be discouraged. Most infants will make a face and push the food right out. They are learning what to do with food in their mouth and soon become comfortable with eating. You may first want to try giving the food after your infant has taken a little breast milk or formula. That way, feeding solid foods will be associated with an enjoyable event. Your infant will eventually be eager to eat.   What not to do during feedings:    Do not put cereal in the bottle unless directed by your healthcare provider.    Try not to feed your infant when you are in a hurry or distracted, or if he or she is too tired.   Do not force food when your infant is showing signs of fullness. Infants are full when they turn their heads away from food or keep their mouth closed when food is offered.   Once the infant has mastered their first food, other new foods can be tried toward the end of this stage of growth. Begin with one to two spoonfuls of a single strained or pureed vegetables, such as squash, carrots or sweet potatoes, or strained fruits. These foods contain no wheat, milk, or egg to which some infants may be sensitive. Some healthcare providers recommend starting vegetables before fruits. There is no evidence that your infant will develop a dislike for vegetables if fruit is given first. Infants are born with a preference for sweets. The order of introducing foods does not change this.   Give one new food every 3-5 days. This allows your infants system to adjust. You should watch for any unusual reactions. It is normal for an infants stool to change color when eating new foods. However, a skin rash, diarrhea, or vomiting may be signs of a food allergy or intolerance. Stop feeding the new food and tell your healthcare provider about the reaction at the next visit. Keep a diary of new foods introduced and any reactions.   Food Allergies   The most common foods that cause an allergic reaction are milk, soy, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, wheat, fish and shellfish. If there is a strong family history of food allergy, ask your healthcare provider for advice about these foods. Otherwise, most experts agree that these foods can be slowly included as early as 4 to 6 months of age.   6 to 8 Months   Continue to give breast milk or formula as well as add thicker pureed fruits, vegetables, and meats to your infants diet. Do not mix foods until your infant has had every food in the combination by itself. If there is no family history of milk allergies, you can also consider introducing small amounts of whole-milk yogurt. Yogurt is easier for infants to digest than cows milk at this stage. Your infant may be ready to practice cup drinking. Give some formula or breast milk in a sippy cup (training cup with a spout).   Breastmilk or formula is the only fluid your infant needs at this stage. After the age of six months, if you choose to give juice, it should only be 100% fruit juice. Juice should not replace the amount of breast milk or formula your infant is drinking. Limit juice to no more than 4 ounces a day and offer it only with a meal or snack. Give it in a cup, never in a bottle or sippy cup as this can lead to tooth decay.   8 to 10 Months   At this time, most infants are ready to eat more textured foods such as mashed and diced foods. New foods, such as finger foods, may be introduced. Chop food into small bite-size pieces. Ripe banana, well-cooked vegetables, and teething biscuits are all good choices. Avoid giving foods that can cause your infant to choke. Uncooked vegetables or fruits (except bananas and avocados), chunks of cheese, whole grapes, peanuts, popcorn, and hot dog pieces should not be given. Poorly chewed food can block the airway and infants cant cough or clear their throats well enough to remove the food.   Your infant may begin finger foods when able to:   Sit up straight in a high chair   Grasp food with hands or fingertips   Move food from hands to mouth   10 to 12 Months   Even without all of their teeth, infants can still use their gums and tongue to mash food with lumps. Keep offering new foods. It can take 8-15 times of trying a new food for an infant to accept it. Your infant is becoming more independent and may be able to hold a spoon when being fed. Encourage self-feeding as much as possible. While you are feeding your infant, name the food, utensils being used, or colors of the food. Remember, each feeding is a special time for you to communicate together.   Whole cows milk (up to 16-20 ounces per day) should only be introduced after your infant turns one. Young infants can't digest cow's milk as easily as breast milk or formula. This is because cows milk contains higher amounts of protein and some minerals. Whole milk yogurt can be introduced earlier, since it is easier for infants to digest than cows milk. The fat in whole milk is important for proper growth and development. Low-fat dairy should not be given until two years of age, unless your healthcare provider recommends it. If your infant was put on a special formula for a milk allergy or intolerance, talk to your healthcare providerbefore introducing dairy.   The National Association of Pediatric Nurse Practitioners and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend breastfeeding until at least one year of age. Breastfeeding can be continued past this time if you and your infant choose to do so.      Vitamin and Mineral Supplementation   Your infant may need more iron and vitamin D, even if they are growing well. Iron is needed to build red blood cells. Though infants are born with stored iron, it is used up around four to six months of age. After that, it must then be replaced with iron in the infants diet. Vitamin D is another important nutrient. It is needed to build strong bones. Breast milk alone does not provide infants with enough vitamin D or iron. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants receive these nutrients either from food or supplements. Check with your healthcare provider about vitamin D and iron supplements during the first year.   Homemade Baby Food   You may choose to make homemade baby food for your infant.  Peas, corn, and sweet potatoes are good choices for home-prepared baby foods.  Infants younger than 6 months of age should not eat homemade spinach, beets, turnips, collard greens, green beans, squash, and carrots. These vegetables contain large amounts of nitrates. Nitrates can cause a low blood count in young infants.  Store-bought vegetables are safer because the manufacturers test for nitrates.    Baby food made at home should be steamed and then mashed with a fork. Never add honey or corn syrup because they may contain dangerous botulism spores. Do not add salt or seasoning while cooking fresh foods for your infant. Always refrigerate leftover food. Also, look for signs of spoilage before giving the food to your infant. Fresh foods will spoil more quickly than food from a can or jar.   Safety at the Plate   Follow these simple guidelines to help your infant stay safe while eating:   Always supervise your infant while eating. Choking often occurs when infants are given foods they are not ready to eat.   Cut foods into small pieces (1/4 inch or smaller). Place only a few pieces on the plate at a time.   Encourage your infant to take small bites and chew food completely.   It is important that your infant sits down when eating. Never let your infant eat while lying down or walking."
A Guide for Starting Solids [INFOGRAPHIC],http://www.foodinsight.org/starting-solids-infographic,"Your baby needs only one type of food for the first sixmonths of life. Health organizations recommend exclusive breastfeeding, or iron-fortified infant formula, for this first stage. But after that, things can get a little confusing. Many caregivers have questions about the process of starting solids. This infographic provides a simple timeline to help you make sense of the process of introducing solid foods.   Remember, not all babies follow the same timeline for introducing solid foods. Your doctor or registered dietitian can help you tailor the process to your babys nutrition and developmental needs. Make sure your baby achieves a few key developmental milestones before starting solid foods. Your babys birthweight should have doubled since birth. Theyshould also be able to hold their head up by themselves, sit up with support, and hold food in their mouth without pushing it out. Typically, babies are ready to start solids around sixmonths of age, though some babies may be ready a month or so earlier.

Setting the Record Straight on Food Safety,http://www.foodinsight.org/cfsec-panel-food-safety-social-media,"Fad diets and iffy scientific studies occupy so much of the dialogue around food and nutrition issues that it can be easy to lose sight of the things that really count the mostthe ones that are truly matters of life and death.   Did you know that about 3,000 Americans  die every year  from foodborne illnesses? More tragic than the deaths themselves is the realization that they can be prevented, usually just with safe food-handling practices.   Reaching consumers with messages relating to food safety behaviors is a big part of the mission of the  Partnership for Food Safety Education , which hosts the annual Consumer Food Safety Education Conference (CFSEC). I took part in a CFSEC panel discussion, moderated by the IFIC Foundations  Tony Flood , on Consumer Confusion: The Keys to Motivate Positive Food Safety Behavior Change.   The IFIC Foundations annual  Food and Health Survey  noted a steady decline in consumers confidence in the safety of the food supply, falling from 78 percent in 2012 to 61 percent in 2015. However, that number  significantly increased in 2016  to 66 percent.   An Influential Media   While its difficult to pin those trends on any single factor, our survey data haveshown that negative media coverage has a lot of sway over our attitudes about food. At least some of the uptick last year in consumer confidence might be attributed to an election year with unprecedented levels of interest that crowded out media coverage of so many other issues.   Perhaps related, the increase in consumer confidence also correlated with the declining influence of some of the most prominent voices in food conversationsparticularly those whose stock in trade is fear and sensational claims. Dr. Oz,who has come under intense media and government  criticism  in recent years, has seen his TV audience decline from about 3.8 million viewers in 2012 to 1.5 million in 2016.   Vani Hari, aka the Food Babe, published a book that  provoked  an unusually  hostile  reception among  some  media  outlets . Its likely no coincidence that Google Trends, which is a rough gauge of interest in a person or topic, showed that Food Babes influence fell  more than half  between May 2015 and the end of 2016, despite a spike during her books publicity tour.   Spreading Your Own Message   We discussed the power of social media, especially Facebook, in reaching consumers and helping bring about behavior change. According to the Pew Research Center, 68 percent of all Americans are Facebook users. An astounding 44 percent of all Americans get their news from Facebook.   One key to reaching consumers is to know your audiences and adapt accordingly. For instance, the IFIC Foundation has drilled down into its data to discern  key differences  between Millennials and Baby Boomers.   Communicators also must have plans and strategies to reach consumers  before  crises, such as food recalls, arise. The IFIC Foundation, along with many other communications organizations, maintains a content calendar to ensure a steady flow of reliable information. Front and center in our strategy is the power of visuals such as  infographics . Studies have shown that social media posts are far more likely to be seen and read if accompanied by an image.   Best practices also include adopting an accessible tone and personality; finding like-minded communities, such as Facebook pages, and engaging with them; and constantly reviewing and revising communications approaches, using tools such as Google Analytics.   Also speaking on our CFSEC panel was  Dr. Bob Gravani , a food science expert who is also chairman of the IFIC Foundation Board of Trustees, and  Michle Samarya-Timm  with the Somerset County Department of Health in New Jersey."

Bright Papers for Parents: How to Pack Grade-A Lunches That Kids Will Like,http://www.foodinsight.org/Bright_Papers_for_Parents_How_to_Pack_Grade_A_Lunches_That_Kids_Will_Like,"Ever wonder what happens to that nice, balanced lunch you packed for your child to take to school? Does it get eaten or traded or even tossed in the trash? Parents want kids to eat nutritious lunches, while kids want lunches that are fun and great-tasting.   Never fear you can improve the odds that your kids will eat what you pack and like it, too! Try these lunch-packing strategies:   Think variety.  Try to include something from most of the MyPyramid food groups in every lunch. Rotate choices to promote variety and prevent boredom. This also helps to ensure that lunch will provide about one-third of a child's daily nutrient needs.   Send what kids like.  Ask your child to make a list of his/her favorite lunch ingredients from each MyPyramid food group. Then use this list to create his/her lunch menus. Better yet, get him/her involved in the shopping and packing.   Break out of the peanut butter rut.  Experiment with some new fillings for sandwiches, like low-fat lunchmeats (try flavors like smoked turkey!), cheeses, grilled veggies or chicken, tuna and egg salad (see ""Keep lunches safe"" section below). And try using different types of breads, such as bagels, rolls, pita pockets, English muffins, raisin bread or waffles (use whole-grain varieties whenever you can). If your child is devoted to peanut butter, jazz up the old PB&J standby with sliced bananas or apples, raisins, shredded carrots or granola.   Go beyond sandwiches.  The options are endless. Send pasta salad made with fun-shaped, colored pastas. Make a pizza or quesadilla on a tortilla or pita round. Or roll meat and cheese slices in a flour tortilla to make a pinwheel sandwich. Leftovers are great toolike spaghetti, a chicken leg or a hearty soup, to name a few.   Got milk?  If your child's school serves milk, it's a good idea to send milk money each day. If not, look for individual milk boxes at the grocery store. Milk tastes best when it is ice cold, so freeze the milk the night before, and by lunchtime it will be thawed, but chilled. Mini-cheese wedges, cheese cubes and cheese sticks are kid favorites, too. Yogurt and pudding cups make a nutritious dessert.   Play up the produce.  Baby carrots, celery sticks, sweet pepper slices, cherry tomatoes and other crunchy veggies are great for dipping in low-fat ranch dressing, salsa or hummus (chickpea dip). Slice apples, pears or other fruits for dipping in low-fat vanilla or lemon yogurt. Make fruit kebobs with fresh fruit chunks on straws. Or send single-serve cups of fruit, applesauce or dried fruits.   Pack some pizzazz.  Kids love fun and surprises in their lunch. Be creative with shapes, colors, and themes. For example, pack a round meala bagel with veggie cream cheese, an orange, carrot rounds and jelly beans. Or cut sandwiches into puzzle pieces. Have a ""red lunch"" day with spaghetti, red grapes, strawberry milk and red fruit leather. Make a backward lunch with a sandwich made with the meat and cheese on the outside and a note written in reverse telling the child to eat dessert first. Throw in an extra touch with a love note, joke or comic strip.   Keep lunches safe.  Keep hot foods hot and cold foods cold. Use an insulated lunch box or small cooler. Include an ice pack or frozen bottle of water, juice or yogurt to help keep things cold. Use a Thermos to keep soups, casseroles or chili hot.

"Our Favorite Tricks for Nutrition, and Treats for Splurging",http://www.foodinsight.org/halloween-trick-nutrition-treats-splurging,"You can't find a ""one-size-fits-all"" nutrition plan. We all have different ideas on how to stick to a healthful routine. So this Halloween, all of us at Food Insight wanted to share with you our favorite tricks for maintaining a healthy eating pattern, and on the other hand,our favorite treats for splurging. Enjoy!   Prepping for the Holiday Party  My favorite trick is to eat something low-calorie and filling in advance of being around high-calorie treats. I like crispy bran crackers. Taking this extra step helps me to not go overboard on treats. Im looking forward to a Halloween splurge of my favorite combination of chocolate and peanut butter candy. I might even try it as a topper on crispy bran crackers with a piece of apple or banana to maximize the treat in a new way!""  -  Kimberly Reed, president, IFIC Foundation       Sharing is Caring  ""My favorite trick is when dining out, my wife and I try to share an entre whenever possible. The portions usually end up being just right, even if we start with an appetizer. We dont overspend, overeat or have to deal with taking home leftovers. My favorite treat is avocado. It goes with everything  at least in my house it does. Its loaded with healthy fats and gets me fullona relatively small volume of food. I cant wait to try some avocado ice cream!""  -  Kris Sollid, RD,director of nutritioncommunications       Small But Mighty  ""I love those Halloween butter cookies with frosting on top. The cookies are soft and the frosting is so good; its my own deliciously spooky form of kryptonite to my diet. So to prevent me from eating too many at once, I like to use my short stature to my advantage. At 53, to reach the top shelves in my apartment, I have to use a step stool. This is sometimes a burden of some sorts, but for delicious Halloween treats, its incentivized portion control. Another trick? I like to eat these cookies with something else, normally a big salad or some fruit. This way, Im still eating something healthful, and I wont finish my cookies hungry and wanting more.""  -  Kami Guiden, digital media manager       Avoiding Temptation  My favorite trick is buying candy I dont like so leftovers are not a problem to haunt me! Yet, Halloween is a special time and if you want to have a treat, you should! But if you splurge on Halloween, dont beat yourself up! Savor the treat and hop back on the moderation wagon on All Saints Day.  - Geraldine McCann, chief operating officer         Staying Hydrated  My favorite trick to avoid snacking too much throughout the day is to be sure to drink lots of water. Sometimes I want a little flavor so I will opt for flavored sparkling water (with no calories). Drinking enough water can also help with satiation throughout the day. Also,water is good for you! My favorite treat to splurge on is chocolate  I LOVE it! But for some added health value, Ill often opt for dark chocolate.  - Tamika Sims, PhD, director of food technology communications          A Tip for the Kids  ""After trick-or-treating, my favorite trick was to have my children go through the candy they received and pick out their favorites. The rest was disposed of and what was left was placed in the freezer. They were allowed to select 3-4 pieces for a weekend treat. This helped them to learn portion control as they grew up.""  - Ruth Ayers, manager of board relations and strategic initiatives        All About Those Portions  ""My favorite trick for splurging is eating half and saving the other half for lunch the next day. Another trick is to order from the appetizer menu. The portions are smaller and often cost less."" - TonyFlood, senior director of food safety               Home Delivered Meals  ""I dont know if its my favorite trick, but my newest trickas of this weekis to subscribe to a home meal delivery service. I want to eat more healthfully and better control my portions, while not purchasing too many perishable ingredients. Plus, I hope it will be a 'gateway'for me to learn more cooking skills. For my favorite treat, Im going to be totally original and pick ice creampreferably vanilla, chock-full of goodies like chocolate chip cookie dough, brownie bits or toffee. Even so, its still all about portion control. Instead of eating from the pint carton, Ill scoop a sensible amount into a small bowl. It doesnt guarantee that I wont eat the whole thing anyway, but at least it gives me a fighting chance.""  - Matt Raymond, senior director of communications          Sneaking in the Veggies  ""Myfavoritetrick is to sneak in veggies wherever I can. This usually means that Ill have some baby carrots or celery as part of my mid-afternoon snack. I also always have frozen vegetables in my freezer. They are a great way to add more veggies to a stir fry, casserole, or sauce at dinner. Taking the opportunity to get an extra serving of vegetables keeps mefull during the day. I'll be less likely to hit up the tempting candy bowl right outside of my office. My go-to treat is dark chocolate. I keep bars of 70-80 percentdark chocolate in my desk, in my kitchen, and in my work bag. Throughout the day, I will usually have 2-3 small squares, and its one of my favorite sweet(ish) treats that I enjoy each day. The extra added bonus of flavonoids is great too!""  -  Megan Meyer, PhD, associate director of science communications            Out of Sight, Out of Mind  ""My favorite trick is to limit the treats I bring home. Its all about out of sight, out of mind. Its a lot easier to maintain a healthy eating pattern if you are mindful of the items youbring into your home. When I do splurge, I choose items that make me feel like Im eating a lot, but in reality, the caloric intake is minimal. One of my favorite treats for this is popcorn . Popcorn is chocked full of whole grains and, in turn, lots of fiber. But when its time to really treat yoself, Im all about chocolate chip cookie dough ice cream.  - Laura Kubitz, manager of media communications"
What I Learned About Nutrition As a Mom-To-Be,http://www.foodinsight.org/mothers-day-feeding-children-infants-teens-calcium-healthy,"As a mom of three boys, Ive had my challenges. Luckily, none of them stemmed from food or beverages. I firmly believe that good eating habits begin forming right at that first feeding shortly after birth, and that as a mom, you have a lot of influence those first few years to establish healthy habits that will carry through your childrens lives.   For Mothers Day, I thought Id share my tips for feeding children. If things go well in the very beginning, your child will be set for life, and by the teen years, well, at least nutrition wont be an issue.   Breast or Bottle?   Thats up to the mom. While Id encourage every new mom to try to breastfeed, its clear that its a more natural and easygoing process for some. This doesnt mean that those who dont or cant breastfeed their infants are failures! The more important thingis how you feed your baby.   Newborns require small, frequent feedings. Pay attention to your babys cues. If he starts to pull away from breast or bottle, or fuss, take a break. He may be full and finished, or perhaps needs to burp. Dont force an infant to finish a bottle. When he seems to be done, hes done.   Keep track of your infants weight by checking in regularly with your pediatrician.   Table Manners   Breast milk or infant formula is all baby needs the first 12 months of life. But by sixmonths, when baby can sit up in a highchair, its okay to gradually begin offering solid foods. Its not just  what i s offered, but  how and how much . Set the stage for healthy habits by eating on a regular schedule, sitting at the table, helping baby learn to use a spoon and cup, and encouraging good manners. Talk to your pediatrician before beginning solid foods.   Dont Sign Up for the Clean Plate Club   You may have been brought up to clean your plate!, but this rule doesnt support good eating habits early on. Offer very small portions to toddlers (about 1 tablespoon of protein, starch, vegetable or fruit), and if they finish it and still seem hungry, offer another portion. Studies show that children who drink milk have better diet quality, so I recommend milk as the beverage of choice for mealtime.   Teen Struggles   The teen years are often as tough as youve heard theyd be. At this age, there are so many issues that may be going on in your childs lifethat potato chips or an occasional soda are probably the least of your worries. My best advice at this point is to continue to provide healthy meals at home, have healthy snacks on hand at all times (fresh fruit, yogurt, popcorn, nuts, sandwich fixings or make-your-own,healthy pizza fixings) and give them some autonomy. Encourage physical activity and healthy beverage choices (such as water andmilk). A teenagers need for calcium is still high (1,200-1,500 milligrams a day, or about four 8-ounce glasses of milk). In fact, the teen years are a time that they are absorbing more calcium into their bones than ever.   Skip the Food Fights   If you support good eating habits in your baby early on, by the time your child goes to school they should be making reasonable choices and be at a healthy weight. The less of a big deal you make of eating your vegetables or limiting treats, the better. Ive never deprived my children of snack chips, cookies, or candy, and they learned to self-monitor. Of course, monkey see, monkey do. So as the parent, be sure your kids see you enjoying appropriate portions of healthy foods and beverages and exercising regularly.

Good Intentions that May Lead to Bad Outcomes: Home-Made Infant Formula,http://www.foodinsight.org/Good_Intentions_that_May_Lead_to_Bad_Outcomes_Home_Made_Infant_Formula,"For newborn babies and infants, proper nutrition is vital to their healthy growth and development. For optimum nutrition benefits, mothers are encouraged to breastfeed their infants, but sometimes for various reasons they are either unable to, choose not to, or need to supplement breastfeeding.   For those mothers who are not breastfeeding their infants, commercially prepared infant formula is the best alternative. These products have been, and continue to be, thoroughly tested for nutrient adequacy and safety. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets and enforces specific limits on safe levels of key ingredients, such as certain vitamins and minerals, for all commercially available infant formulas. Commercial infant formulas must meet all the requirements of the  Infant Formula Act , which was developed to safeguard the nutritional health of infants, with very specific ingredient, manufacturing, testing, and labeling requirements.   Despite the high standards and rigorous testing of commercially prepared infant formulas set by the FDA, some parents are concerned about the possible presence of ingredients in these products that have been developed through biotechnology. Some of these concerns stem from claims that biotechnology may cause food allergies. But, Wesley Burks, MD, pediatric allergist and chairman of the department of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina Medical School, assures us that foods developed using biotechnology do not lead to food allergies. Allergic disease truly has changed in the last 20 to 30 years. Theres lots of reasons why its differentTheres a hygiene hypothesis, changes in our gastrointestinal systemthe environmentThose \[reasons\] are much, much, much more likely to have a part in the change of allergic disease than anything related to food biotechnology. Its not even on my list of things that I think about because of what I know about the safety and approval process in the development of these foods. (IFIC Foundation videos,  Physicians Offer Expert Advice on Food Biotechnology ) In addition, trusted health organizations such as the American Medical Association have endorsed the responsible use of biotechnology to enhance food production.   As a pediatrician and someone who takes care of children and often is speaking with moms who are pregnant, I feel that these foods are completely safe for children. I personally have reviewed the safety data and the evidence thats put together when these foods are about to be put into the general marketplace, and I find that these foods are completely safe. Theres no evidence that foods produced using biotechnology pose any risk to children or pregnant mothers.   Ronald Kleinman, MD, pediatrician and physician in chief at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children (From the IFIC Foundation videos,  Physicians Offer Expert Advice on Food Biotechnology )   When it comes to concerns about the safety of foods produced with biotechnology for women and children, Laurie Green, MD, practicing obstetrician and gynecologist, and partner at the Pacific Women for OB/GYN Care in San Francisco, says, There are so many things people worry about. The things that would be really important like household products that might cause harm, it gets lost in the shuffle because theres almost too much information\[Biotech foods\] have been used for 20 years in 29 countries and consumed by millions and millions of people including pregnant women and children over nearly two decades. (IFIC Foundation videos,  Physicians Offer Expert Advice on Food Biotechnology )   Out of fear, some advocates have convinced parents that they should be concerned and that they should take matters into their own hands. While it is understandable that parents would want to take any measure possible to minimize a potential risk to their child, good intentions can sometimes lead to dangerous outcomes. For example, various individuals and organizations have taken to the internet to endorse homemade infant formula recipes as a way to avoid products containing ingredients produced with biotechnology; however, there are serious food safety risks of doing so that far outweigh any perceived risk of food biotechnology.   Consumption of homemade formulas can lead to potentially serious health consequences for babies. There is no nutritional analysis for these home recipes, and consuming improper quantities of nutrients can cause poor growth and development. Some recipes call for the use of unpasteurized or raw milk, raising the risk of the presence of E. coli, Listeria, Campylobacter spp, or Salmonellapathogens that can cause serious health risks. Registered dietitian and director of nutrition at Washington University in St. Louis, Connie Diekman, MEd, RD, CSSD, LD, says, Consuming raw milk increases the potential risk of foodborne illness since the bacteria often found in milk have not been destroyed by pasteurization. Young children, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems are especially at risk for getting sick when they consume raw milk. As a registered dietitian, I would discourage anyone from consuming raw milk.   According to the  American Academy of Pediatrics  (AAP), commercial infant formula is the only safe source of food for nonbreastfed infants up to 6 months old and an important food source for nonbreastfed infants through their first year.   Keith Ayoob, EdD, RD, FADA, a practicing pediatric nutritionist and associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine sums it up best: I can applaud the intent of mothers wanting to take an active role in feeding their infants when they can't breastfeed. This is an issue, however, where reality and safety have to trump intent. Commercially prepared formulas are far less risky than homemade baby formula. They provide complete nutrition for the infant; for a mother who cannot breastfeed, they are the go-to option.   The AAP recommends that infants drink only breast milk or commercial infant formula until age 4 to 6 months, and to continue with breast milk or commercial infant formula until at least 12 months of age. In addition, because of digestion/absorption and other issues that can impact an infants growth and development, the AAP does not recommend introducing whole cows milk until after 12 months of age. When a child is ready for other foods to be introduced, the AAP also strongly recommends feeding products that have been pasteurized to kill bacteria and parasites often found in raw beverages. Robert V. Tauxe, MD, MPH, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases, and co-author of the latest CDC  report  on attribution of foodborne illnesses to food commodities in the US, confirms that the CDC is concerned about the trend of consumers drinking raw milk and says, The practice of pasteurizing milk is one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.   Parents are strongly encouraged to discuss infant feeding issues and questions with an experienced health professional such as their childs personal pediatrician (and not the internet!) before embarking on a do-it-yourself infant formula experiment. Babies safety, health, development, and growth depend on it.   For more information, go to:     Why Formula Instead of Cow's Milk?  AAP Healthy Children article   Got Milk?

The Vitamin B Complex: It's Actually Not That Complex,http://www.foodinsight.org/vitamin-b-complex-sources-amounts-riboflavin-niacin-folate-thiamine,"B vitamins primarily help our bodies convert food into fuel that we use for energy. While there are eight B vitamins found in foods, we are just going to focus on four: B1, B2, B3, and B9. (""Gaps"" in the numbering of B vitamins from 1 to 12 are substances that were discovered but were later not considered to be B vitamins, or were found to haveno nutritional value.) Most of these vitamins, often referred to as other names, are probably more recognizable. For example, vitamin B1 is commonly known as thiamine, vitamin B2 as riboflavin, vitamin B3 as niacin, and vitamin B9 as folate or folic acid. Read on to learn more about their health benefits, sources, and how much you should be aiming to incorporate into your diet.   What other health benefits do these micronutrients have?   Along with helping produce energy, B vitamins also enable the nervous system to function properly and are key for a healthy liver, skin, hair, and eyes. While many of these vitamins work together, each vitamin has its own specific roles and benefits. For example, vitamin B1 helps the body produce new cells and strengthens the immune system. Vitamin B2 works as an antioxidant, which protects cells and DNA from damage. It is also important for growth and red blood cell production. Vitamin B3 helps the body make hormones in your adrenal glands and helps suppress inflammation by improving circulation. And last but not least, vitamin B9 is necessary for proper brain function and is especially important at times when cells and tissues are growing rapidly, such as pregnancy.       How much vitamin B1 should I aim for, and what foods should I focus on?   Foods that are rich in vitamin B1 are bread and bread products, fortified cereal and meat substitutes, ham, pork, and whole grain foods.

The Scoop on Alternative Flours,http://www.foodinsight.org/alternative-flours-gluten-free-soy-almond-spelt-quinoa-amaranth-chickpea-coconut-brown-rice,"The minute that bag of flour hits the countertop, you know youre in for something delicious. Warm, homemade bread, cakes and pastries are the epitome of comfort food.   A great way to experiment with your old favorites is by trying out some of the new ingredients popping up on store shelves. All-purpose flour is no longer the only game in town. Predicted to be a big hit this year, alternative flours have been slowly sneaking into our kitchens, and it seems like theres no end in sight. Welooked into some to find out what they have to offer and the best ways to use them.    Soy Flour   Soy flour is made from ground soybeans and is packed with protein. It adds moisture and a nutty flavor to baked goods. A low-fat version is also available. Soy flour causes food to brown more quickly, so make sure to lower your oven temperature or shorten cooking time. Store it in the refrigerator to prevent spoilage. Its best used for thickening liquids like soups, or substituting up to one-third for white flour in cakes, cookies and quick breads.   Per  cup: 120 cal, 6 g fat (1 g sat fat), 0 mg sodium, 8 g carbs (2 g sugars), 3 g fiber, 10 g protein, 30% magnesium, 25% iron, 14% phosphorus, 10% calcium   Brown Rice Flour   Brown rice flour is made from whole rice kernels and can be used like you would whole-wheat flour. A white rice flour version is also available and can be used as a one-to-one substitute for all-purpose white flour. Brown rice flour can yield a grittier texture to baked goods but is a good alternative for those who need to follow a gluten-free diet. The dough can be sticky to handle. Because brown rice flour is gluten-free, baked goods will not rise like those made with all-purpose flour.   Per  cup: 140 cal, 1 g fat, (1 g sat fat), 5 mg sodium, 31 g carbs (0 g sugars), 2 g fiber, 3 g protein, 4% iron   Chickpea Flour   Chickpea flour, also known as garbanzo or gram flour, is made by grinding dried chickpeas into a powder. It has a nutty flavor and can be used in place of whole-wheat flour, as an egg substitute in baked goods, orto add flavor to and thicken soups and sauces. To replace an egg, use  cup chickpea flour, plus  cup water or milk.   Per  cup: 110 cal, 2 g fat (0 g sat fat), 5 mg sodium, 18 g carbs (3 g sugars), 6 g protein, 10% iron, 4% calcium   Coconut Flour   As coconut flour is made from the dried pulp of a coconut, it is high in fiber and has a light, mildly sweet coconut flavor. Coconut flour can be used to substitute 20-to-30 percent of all-purpose flour for most baked goods. Its also a great way to add extra fiber and protein when breading meats, thickening sauces and gravies, and making smoothies, shakes and hot chocolate.   Per 2 Tbsps: 60 cal, 2 g fat (2 g sat fat), 30 mg sodium, 8 g carbs (1 g sugars), 5 g fiber, 2 g protein, 10% iron   Amaranth Flour   Amaranth flour is made from an ancient grain. The flour is too dense to be used on its own but can substitute for all-purpose flour in baked goods by up to 25 percent. Amaranth flour has an earthy, grassy taste. Therefore, it works better in savory dishes like breads and pizza dough as well as to thicken sauces, gravies and soups.   Per  cup: 110 cal, 2 g fat (0.5 g sat fat), 6 mg sodium, 20 g carbs (0 g sugars), 3 g fiber, 4 g protein, 12% iron, 4% calcium   Quinoa Flour   Quinoa flour contains a complete protein that provides essential amino acids, which are the building blocks for muscles. It can be used to substitute for all-purpose flour one-to-one but will yield a grainier texture to baked goods. Because of its bitter flavor, it works best with strong-flavored savory baked goods like cheddar cheese biscuits and herb muffins. To cut the bitterness, you can also try toasting your flour at 215F for 2.5 to 3 hours, until its strong, grassy smell is gone and the flour tastes mild.   Per  cup: 110 cal, 1.5 g fat (0 g sat fat), 8 mg sodium, 18 g carbs (0 g sugars), 2 g fiber, 4 g protein, 7% iron   Almond Flour   Almond flour or almond meal is made from blanched almond nuts. Because nuts are high in good fats, this flour needs to be refrigerated to prevent spoiling. It adds moisture, a nutty flavor and can replace up to one-fourth of the white flour in pastries, cookies and cakes. Almond flour shouldnt be used to replace flour in yeast or quick breads. It is great for using on recipes that call for breadcrumbs.   Per  cup: 160 cal, 14 g fat (1 g sat fat), 0 mg sodium, 6 g carbs (1 g sugars), 3 g fiber, 6 g protein, 35% vitamin E, 20% magnesium, 6% calcium, 6% iron   Spelt Flour   Spelt flour is made from an ancient grain and is very similar to wheat flour. It comes in refined and whole versions and has a nutty, light flavor. Spelt flour can be substituted one-to-one for all-purpose flour without compromising the consistency of baked goods.   Per  cup: 120 cal, 1 g fat (0 g sat fat), 1 mg sodium, 22 g carbs (0 g sugars), 4 g fiber, 4 g protein, 8% iron   Although alternative flours can be a great way to add nutritional variety to your diet, its important to note that, unlike all-purpose flour, they are not enriched with minerals like folic acid. Folic acid is an important nutrient that helps prevent  birth defects . In the end, all-purpose flour will always be a staple, but alternative flours can also be a great way to experiment in the kitchen."

Vitamin C and Iron: A Perfect Match,http://www.foodinsight.org/nutrition-vitamin-c-iron-health-deficiency,"When you think of vitamins and minerals, what is the first one that comes to mind? I know for me personally, its vitamin C. As an immunologist, its the micronutrient I get asked about a ton, especially around cold and flu season.   You might see vitamin C listed as ascorbic acid, ascorbyl palmitate, calcium ascorbate, or sodium ascorbate. Despite having differentand sometimes difficult-to-pronouncenames, they are the same thing.   Want to know another fun fact? Vitamin C helps with other  micronutrient absorption , especially iron.  Iron deficiencies  are common among women, children, and vegetarians, so boosting iron levels through vitamin C supplementation is a good strategy to make sure these populations maintain adequate iron levels.    What are some health benefits of these specific micronutrients?   Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant, which can promote skin health and strengthen your immune system. Additionally, vitamin C is key for maintaining your metabolism and supporting your nervous system. Iron is critical for moving oxygen around the body, so iron mainly promotes cardiovascular health. Iron also plays a role in your bodys metabolism.     How much vitamin C should I aim for and what foods should I focus on?   Foods rich in vitamin C can be found in vegetables such as broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, potatoes, spinach, and tomatoes;fruits like citrusand strawberries; and juices like citrus juice and tomato juice. To better help you understand how much vitamin C you should be getting and how much of it is in certain foods, see the tables below.

Surprising Support for Low-Calorie Sweeteners: Expert Q&A,http://www.foodinsight.org/blogs/surprising-support-low-calorie-sweeteners-expert-qa,"Each week, it seems a different nutritional topic  sweeteners, caffeine, food coloring, salt, carbs, or fat  is in the headlines. Is it good for you? Should you avoid it? Usually the advice changes before you can get to the grocery store. Its no wonder people are confused. Theysometimes go to extremes andcut certain foods and ingredients from their diets altogether.   Low-calorie sweeteners, specifically, have come under fire. People don't understand these ingredients are well-studied. Evenregulatory agencies such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recognized them to be safe. We spoke with Liz Applegate, Ph.D. to answer some key questions about sweeteners. Applegate is director of sports nutrition at the University of California at Davis, author, IFIC advisor and writer of the Fridge Nutrition blog and monthly column for Runners World .      Q: First off, why do we even need low-calorie sweeteners?   A: Low-calorie sweeteners provide sweetness without adding calories or carbohydrates. Theyre a great tool for people looking to manage their weight. Moreover, people with diabetes may find these sweeteners helpful as they look to control their blood glucose levels. The bottom line is low-calorie sweeteners are good options to reduce calorie and sugar intake while enjoying a sweet taste.      Q: Is one low-calorie sweetener better than another?   A: Several low-calorie sweeteners are found in foods and drinks. They share more in common than you might think. All sweeteners -sucralose, aspartame, stevia or others -are proven safe by scientific research as well as by the FDA. Theycan help people looking to manage their calories.   Each low-cal sweetener carries its own unique characteristics and can be used for different purposes. For instance, some are heat stable, such as sucralose, making them great for baking or cooking. Others low-calorie sweetenersare not. Some may even taste sweeter than others.     Q: Are all low-calorie sweeteners safe for adults and children?   A: Yes. These ingredients have been safely used and enjoyed by people, including children, all over the world for more than a century.   In 2013, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) re-confirmed the low-calorie sweetener aspartame is safe for the general population, including infants and children, based on a full review of existing scientific data on aspartame. There is one exception. People born with a rare condition called phenylketonuria (PKU) cannot metabolize phenylalanine (an amino acid). Theyshould avoid aspartame, which also contains this amino acid. PKU is generally diagnosed at birth during routine newborn blood tests. This conditionrequires a variety of foods containing phenyalanine be limited or avoided in the diet.      Q: Do low-calorie sweeteners help or hurt with weight maintenance?   A: Leading health organizations, such as the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Heart Association, agree foods and beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners can help with weight management, particularly when used in place of full-calorie alternatives as they have little to no calories. Studies have also shown that foods and beverages with low-calorie sweeteners can be part of a weight loss plan. Learn more here.     Q: Do low-calorie sweeteners change peoples sensitivity to sweetness or sweet tastes?   A: While this notion has been suggested by some, the data do not support it. More research is needed on the topic. So farweve seenthat low-calorie sweeteners do not cause sweet cravings.   A 2014 review article found most published studies show no consistent association with consumption of low-calorie sweeteners and sweet foods. In fact,many studies report a reduction in intake of sugar-containing foods.      The net/net: There is a lot of misinformation on the internet about low-calorie sweeteners. Hopefully, these answers help clear up the confusion and allow you to enjoy the flexibility and sweet taste of these great sweetener options. Low-calorie sweeteners help make managing weight a little sweeter.

Everything You Need to Know About Sucralose,http://www.foodinsight.org/articles/everything-you-need-know-about-sucralose,"Favorably Reviewed by the American Academy of Physician Assistants www.aapa.org   Download the PDF  to view this entire brochure.   With obesity rates among Americans at an all-time high, many people may think they have to give up sweets in order to lose weight. But theres good news if you love sweets: Low-calorie sweeteners offer a way to reduce calories in sweet foods and beverages, which may help you lose or maintain your weight. They also offer a way for people with diabetes to decrease their carbohydrate intake.   One commonly consumed low-calorie sweetener is sucralose. The following is everything you need to know about sucralose, including facts about nutrition, safety, uses and benefits.   What is sucralose?  Sucralose adds sweetness to foods and beverages without adding calories or carbohydrates. As an alternative to sugar and other calorie-containing sweeteners, it can play a role in weight management programs that combine sensible nutrition and physical activity.   While the process to make sucralose begins with sucrose, or table sugar, the final product is different from sugar. Sucralose is made by replacing three select hydrogen-oxygen groups on the sugar molecule with three chlorine atoms, resulting in an intensely sweet, no-calorie sweetener.   Unlike sugar, the body does not break down sucralose into calories for energy. Yet, both sugar and sucralose activate the same taste buds on your tongue.   Most of the sucralose people consume is not absorbed and passes through the body. The little that is absorbed is excreted in the urine, and doesnt accumulate in the body.   Sucralose is available in tabletop sweeteners (one well-known brand is Splenda) and also as an ingredient in many products, including a variety of beverages, baked goods, desserts, dairy products, canned fruits, syrups and condiments. Sucralose is 600 times sweeter than sugar, and it can be used in place of or combined with sugar in cooking and baking.   Sucralose has been studied extensively and has been found to be safe by experts and researchers around the world. Government agencies worldwide, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have also reviewed the science on sucralose and found it to be safe for human consumption.   How does sucralose fit into a healthful diet?  As a no-calorie alternative to sugar, sucralose-containing foods and beverages still allow people who are following a weight loss or weight management program to enjoy sweet, good tasting options. For example, a light yogurt containing sucralose can save 50 or more calories per serving compared to regular yogurt, and a 12-ounce glass of iced tea sweetened with sucralose can save more than 100 calories compared to the same glass of tea sweetened with sugar.   Sucralose can be used almost anywhere sugar is used, allowing for a variety of choices when planning low-calorie meals.   How many calories are in sucralose?  Sucralose is not metabolized by the body for energy, and therefore it contains zero calories. Tabletop sweeteners that contain sucralose also contain other ingredients that provide needed texture and volume (such ingredients are also commonly added to other no-calorie sweeteners). While these ingredients are typically carbohydrates, the amount is so small (less than 1 gram per serving) that the calories are insignificant.   Is sucralose safe?  Yes. Sucralose has an excellent safety profile. More than 100 safety studies, representing over 20 years of research, have shown sucralose to be safe.   Scientists have conducted many studies on sucralose to determine whether it had any effects on a number of different health conditions, including growth and development, risk of cancer, chemical effects on the body (or toxicology), developmental abnormalities such as birth defects, and effects on the nervous system.   Experts from a wide range of scientific backgrounds have reviewed these studies and concluded that there are no harmful effects from consuming sucralose, even in people consuming the highest amounts.   Based on its strong safety background, experts, researchers, and government bodies agree that people can consume a variety of foods and beverages sweetened with sucralose on a daily basis without concern.   Global Safety Recognition  Sucralose is approved for use in over 80 countries. In the United States, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) must approve all food additives before they can be used in foods and beverages. The FDA approved sucralose for certain food and beverage categories in 1998, and expanded the approval to all food and beverage categories in 1999. Examples of government and scientific groups that have reviewed sucraloses safety include:   European Union Scientific Committee on Food (SCF)   U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)   Food Standards Australia/New Zealand (FSANZ)   Health Protection Branch of Health and Welfare Canada   (Food and Agriculture Organization/World Health Organization) Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA)   Japans Ministry of Health and Welfare   Does sucralose cause weight gain?  No. Several studies have shown that low-calorie sweeteners can actually aid in weight loss and/or weight management. For example, researchers in one study found that when foods and beverages containing sucralose were used as part of a program to reduce calorie intake and increase levels of physical activity, overweight children were able to slow their rate of weight gain. While a few smaller studies have suggested that low-calorie sweeteners may cause cravings and/or weight gain, such an association has not been confirmed in larger studies, and the majority of the research still finds that low-calorie sweeteners such as sucralose can be helpful weight loss/weight management aids.   With rising obesity rates, people are often looking for one magic solution to help them lose weight. And, while low-calorie sweeteners can help, it is also important to practice portion control and participate in regular physical activity in order to reach weight loss goals. Also, when incorporating foods and beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners into a weight management plan, these products should be used in place of the full-calorie versions in order to reduce total calorie intake.   Can people who have diabetes consume foods and beverages containing sucralose?  Yes. Sucralose has no effect on blood glucose or insulin levels in people with diabetes, and therefore it is safe for them to consume. Foods and beverages sweetened with sucralose provide sweet options that are lower in carbohydrates, which are helpful for people who have diabetes, who must monitor their carbohydrate intake.   As with any nutritional concern, people who have diabetes should talk to a registered dietitian, health care provider and/or diabetes care professional for advice on incorporating foods and beverages containing sucralose into their diets.   Does sucralose cause tooth decay?  No, sucralose does not cause cavities. The bacteria in plaque do not break down or eat sucralose, and therefore the acids that can lead to cavities do not form. Sucralose does not increase the growth of bacteria in the mouth and does not promote tooth decay.   Can pregnant and breastfeeding women consume sucralose?  Yes. Anyone can consume sucralose, including pregnant and breastfeeding women. Research has shown that sucralose does not have harmful effects on pregnant women or their babies. Although sucralose may be consumed as part of a healthful pre- and post-natal diet, a pregnant or breastfeeding woman should talk to her physician or health care provider about consuming the necessary nutrients to support her and her babys health throughout pregnancy and infancy.   Is sucralose safe for children?  Yes. There is no evidence that sucralose is at all harmful to children. In fact, sucralose can be part of the solution to the growing problem of childhood obesity by helping to reduce calories from sugar. Foods containing sucralose, including low-fat flavored milk, yogurt, juices, and pudding, can be included in a healthful meal plan for children to help ensure they are getting all the necessary nutrients, while not getting a lot of extra calories.   Products That Contain Sucralose  Sucralose is used to sweeten a variety of foods and beverages. Products containing sucralose are often lower-calorie products, making them useful for people who are trying to lose or maintain their weight. Products labeled as Light or Reduced Calorie may use a low-calorie sweetener to reduce the calorie content - check the ingredients list for products containing sucralose.   Sucralose appears in over 4,000 products, including:     Dairy Products (low-fat flavored milk, light yogurt, low-fat coffee creamer, etc.)   Cereals & cereal bars   Desserts (light pudding, light ice cream, popsicles, etc.)   Snack Foods (light canned fruit, reduced calorie baked goods, candy, etc.)   Beverages (light juice, iced and hot tea, diet soda, coffee beverages, etc.)   Syrups and Condiments (light maple syrup, low-calorie jams, jellies, etc.)   Nutritional Products & Dietary Supplements   Sucralose At-A-Glance   Scientific Name   Sucralose   Brand Names   Splenda, store brands   Date Approved by FDA   1998   # of Times Sweeter Than Sugar   600   Safe for People With Diabetes?   Yes   Can be Used in Cooking and Baking?   Yes      Using Sucralose in Cooking and Baking   Sucralose may be used in place of, or in combination with, sugar and/or other low-calorie sweeteners to reduce the total calories and carbohydrates from sugar in baked goods.   While the sweetness of sucralose is similar to sugar, the flavor, texture, and/or cooking time of a food made with sucralose may be slightly different than the same food made with sugar. For example, sugar adds volume and can help retain moisture in baked goods. Sugar also has the ability to caramelize, which provides a caramel flavor and color.   With items such as sweet sauces, fruit pie fillings, cheesecakes, glazes, and beverages, complete substitution of sucralose for sugar is possible.   For recipes with a high proportion of sugar and/or those that require browning, partial sugar substitution is best.   In baking recipes calling for sugar, sucralose may be fully or partially substituted for sugar and/or other sweeteners."

Picking for Pregnancy: 3 Tips on Eating Out While Eating for Two,http://www.foodinsight.org/eating-out-pregnant-food-safety,"Hi, again, from the pregnancy diaries. Its been a crazy 9  months with only a few more weeks to go. As I reflect on the joys and challenges of pregnancy, theres one challenge in particular that Id like to shed some lighton:eating away from home while pregnant.   During pregnancy, there are two main concerns on food: making sure you get all the right nutrients and calories needed to support your growing baby and ensuring the food you eat is safe . Both are completely doable but may need more attention when you aren't eating just food you cooked and prepared for yourself.   For example, with food safety, eating out at restaurants brings to mind a ton of questions. Has your food been refrigerated at the right temperature? Was a thermometer used to check the meat? Does the waiter really know if the cheese is pasteurized? You could make yourself crazy trying to stay on top of all the food safety dosand donts anytime you are eating outside of the home. And then what about the nutrition side? How do I know how much 340 extra calories is when ordering off a menu? Is this dish going to give me the calcium I need for the day?   If you are like me, the questions can become overwhelming. Instead, I chose to focus on three simple things to help me navigate the challenges of eating right while away from home during my pregnancy.   1) Make your move with made-to-order food   Whether its a restaurant, caf, or coffeehouse, the best bet is to choose made-to-order food that comes to you either nice and cold or piping hot. Skip the cafeteria section with chicken salad or the display cases full of quiche. You dont know how long they have been sitting out. Too much time at the wrong temperature could make them susceptible to harmful bacteria. If you are dying for that egg sandwich in the window, ask them to heat it up so that it is steaming when you cut into it. Thats the only way to ensure any bacteria has been killed. In general, you are better off ordering something that has a short transit time between the stove/fridge and your stomach.   2) Pick foods that have a plethora of nutrients   Many times during this journey, all I wanted was to sink my teeth into a big ol plate of pasta. But staying focused on eating foods with a variety of nutrients helped steer me in a better direction when ordering out. I would still get the pastabut would always make sure that there were veggies and lean protein, like chicken, also included in the meal. Pregnant women need the right mix of vegetables, fruits, low-fat/non-fat dairy, whole grains, lean proteinand healthy fats. It might be a little tough to get all of these at each meal.I decided to challenge myself to get at least three per meal. That way I would stay on track with getting these important nutrients in my diet while still having variety.   3) Consider your calories (no math required)   Remember, you dont need extra calories in the first trimester. In the second trimester, your calorie needs increase by 340. In the third trimester, you should be looking for an extra 500 calories per day. Of course, its important to remember to consume these extra calories in the form ofnutrient-richfoods (see tip #2). But its also OK to have treats once in a while too. Some days you couldnt pry the dessert menu out of my fingers with a blow torch. As long as I was gettingall the important nutrients I needed in other foods, dessert still had a place at my table.   Luckily, many restaurants have their calorie counts on their menus. This can behelpful when trying to consume a certain amount of extra calories . If the calorie count isnt available, there are plenty of online tools to help you keep track of your calories.   Im counting the minutes until I can go back to eating sushi and sunny-side-up eggs. Yet, I have found a lot of consolation in the fact that so many options exist when eating away from home while pregnant. I never found myself saying, Theres nothing I can eat!   Eating out  can  be a regular part of your pregnancy. You can get still get the nutrients you need, stay safe, and most importantly, avoid washing dishes!"
