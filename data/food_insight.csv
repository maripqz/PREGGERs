",http://www.foodinsight.org/healthy-eating-pregnancy-nutrients-weight-gain-food-safety,"A healthy eating pattern is very important during pregnancy. Good nutrition plays a key role in the health of both mother and baby. As a mom-to-be, you have higher nutrient needs than you did before conception. Yet the general principles of good nutritionvariety, balance, and moderationstill apply during pregnancy.This resource will help you learn how to eat healthy during pregnancy. This includes how to choose a variety of healthy foods, maintain healthy weight gain during pregnancy, and stay food-safe.Click here to downloadA Balanced DietWhat a Mom-to-Be Needs Eating a balanced diet before, during, and after pregnancy is one part of good health. This section covers the key nutrients pregnant women need and where to find them.CaloriesCalorie (aka energy for the body) needs increase during pregnancy. But eating for two only requires an additional 340 calories during the second trimester and 500 calories in the third trimester. The first trimester does not require any extra calories.Choose foods and beverages that are nutrient-dense. This means that they good sources of the building blocks your body needs. Nutrient-dense foods are full of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. Eat variety of foods from all five food groups. These include grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy, and meat and beans. This will ensure that you and your growing baby are getting the nutrients you both need.Your nutrient and calorie needs are higher if you are carrying more than one baby. Discuss what and how much to eat with your health care provider.Key NutrientsProteinProtein helps maintain muscle and body tissue. It is also key for a babys growth  especially during the second and third trimesters. Most pregnant women should take in about 70 grams of protein every day to meet their minimum needs. Keep in mind you may need more than that. Protein requirements vary based on weight and activity level. Talk to your health care provider if you have questions about your daily protein intake. Lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and legumes (beans) are good sources of protein. These foods also supply iron, B vitamins, and other important nutrients. Dried beans, lentils, nuts, and soy products like tofu are other good sources of protein.If you are vegetarian, you can meet your protein needs by eating foods that are complete protein sources. A complete protein has all the essential building blocks (amino acids) your body needs. Each day, eat a variety of protein sources to provide your body with essential amino acids. Vegetarian protein options include beans, milk, yogurt, eggs, and soy products. Greek yogurt is another great option. It has twice the amount of protein when compared to regular yogurt. Pregnant vegans are able to meet their protein needs from soy, a complete protein source. Sources of soy protein include soy milk, soy cheese, soy yogurt, tofu, and tempeh. Examples of other protein-rich vegan foods are nuts and beans (red kidney beans, chickpeas, black beans, etc.).CarbohydratesCarbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body. Fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products contain carbohydrates. Whole grains are an important source of nutrients, such as dietary fiber. They also provide a variety of health benefits. Other important carbohydrate foods include enriched refined grains. These grains have the added benefit of iron and folic acid, two essential nutrients for the babys development. Many carbohydrate foods are great choices for breakfast. Including English muffins, yogurt, bagels, cereals, breads, and fruits. Other carbohydrate-containing choices for meals or snacks include crackers, bread, and pasta.Aim to get the majority of your daily calories from carbohydrates. For most people, carbohydrates should make up about 45 to 65 percent of daily calorie intake. Most pregnant and breastfeeding women need about 175-210 grams of carbohydrates per day.FatsFat is key for good nutrition, health, and storage of many important vitamins. Like carbohydrates and protein, dietary fat is an important source of energy for the body. Certain foods that contain fat supply the body with essential fatty acids. Essential fatty acids are fats that the body does not make, so they should be included in the diet. Most importantly, essential fatty acids are critical for the babys growth and development.Health experts recommend keeping total fat intake between 20 and 35 percent of total calories. Most fats should come from unsaturated sources. Sources of unsaturated fat include fish, vegetable oils (canola, soybean, olive, peanut, safflower, and sunflower oils), nuts, and flaxseeds. All women, including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should follow these recommendations.DHA is an unsaturated fat that is important for babies brain and eye development. Pregnant women should aim to get 200 mg of DHA per day. Oily fish such as salmon and tuna contain DHA. For example, a serving of salmon (3.5 ozor roughly the size of a deck of cards) has over 1g of DHA. This is five times the recommended amount. A health care provider may recommend a dietary supplement or prenatal vitamin with DHA. For more information on eating fish during pregnancy, see the Food Safety section.CalciumCalcium is important for the growth of strong bones and teeth. Calcium intake is necessary for all women. Especially pregnant women younger than 25 years old whose bones are still growing.Pregnant women should aim to consume 1,000 mg of calcium per day. This is about three servings of calcium-rich foods. Women 18 years and younger need 1,300 mg per day, or four servings of foods high in calcium. Many women do not get enough calcium, so it is important to focus on calcium-rich foods. Women who do not consume dairy products should consider a calcium supplement or a multivitamin.Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese are good sources of calcium. Non-fat (skim) and low-fat (1%) dairy have equal amounts of calcium and fewer calories than higher fat (2% and whole) dairy.Other sources of calcium include dark green, leafy vegetables, dried beans and peas, nuts and seeds, and sardines. Calcium-fortified foods and beverages are also good sources of calcium. These include some orange juices, soy milk, tofu, almond milk, and breakfast cereals. It is easiest to meet your calcium needs through dairy foods. If you are vegan, have lactose intolerance, or a milk allergy, ask your health care provider how to consume enough calcium.Pregnant women should not consume raw (unpasteurized) milk or eat foods that contain raw milk. Raw milk can increase the risk of very dangerous foodborne illnesses, including listeriosis. For more information, see the Food Safety section of this resource.Vitamin DVitamin D is important for calcium absorption, immune function and brain health. Sunlight is one source of Vitamin D. About five to ten minutes of sunlight to exposed arms or the face can supply a days worth of Vitamin D. These times can vary depending on your geographical location and skin color. Aim for fifty mcg, or 2,000 IUs, of Vitamin D per day. This goal can be met with a multivitamin. Milk or yogurt with added Vitamin D can help you meet your daily needs. Oily fish, mushrooms, fortified cereals, and dietary supplements also contain vitamin D.IronIron carries oxygen through the blood and delivers it throughout the body. It also aids in immunity, brain development, and metabolism. About 90 percent of the iron in the body is recycled every day. The growing baby also stores enough iron to last through the first few months of life.Pregnant women have an increased amount of blood in their bodies so they need more iron than non-pregnant women. Pregnant women should aim for a total of 45 mg of iron per day from foods and dietary supplements. Animal products, including red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs, are rich in iron. Other options include enriched and whole grain breads, cereals, and pasta. Green leafy vegetables, beans, nuts, eggs, and dried fruits are also a good source.The type of iron found in animal products is different from the iron found in plant sources. The body does not absorb the iron in plant sources as well as the iron in meat, fish, and poultry. But iron absorption can increase when eaten with foods high in vitamin C (like orange juice or red bell peppers). A registered dietitian can recommend iron-rich foods and foods that can help with iron absorption.Many women enter pregnancy with low iron reserves. Your health care provider may recommend iron supplementation starting at the first prenatal visit. Some women may also need screening for iron deficiency on an ongoing basis. Take iron supplements between meals, with water or juice, and not with other supplements. Substances in coffee, tea, and milk can inhibit iron absorption. Taking iron supplements at bedtime may help reduce upset stomach and/or heartburn.Folic Acid/Folate/Vitamin B 9Folic acid, a B vitamin needed to help the baby grow, is key before and throughout pregnancy. Folic acid reduces the risk of spina bifida and other birth defects of the brain and spinal cord, which are also called neural tube defects (NTDs). Folate is the term for the different forms of the nutrient found naturally in foods. Folic acid is the form used in supplements and in enriched grain products.Enriched bread, flour, pasta, rice, cereals, and other grain products are common food sources of folic acid. To see if your food contains folic acid, check food labels to see if the food contains folic acid or folate.Any woman planning to become pregnant should consume 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily to help prevent birth defects. This is along with eating foods that contain folate. Women who have had a baby with NTD in the past should take 4 mg per day of folic acid before getting pregnant again.There are many ways to meet your folate/folic acid needs. First, take a multivitamin with folic acid. Also, be sure to eat lots of fruits and vegetables, enriched grain products, legumes (such as peanuts), citrus fruits and juices.Other Food IngredientsCaffeineCoffee, tea, energy drinks, some soft drinks, chocolate, and some over-the-counter medications contain caffeine. Pregnant or not, it is important to estimate your total caffeine intake from all sources. Caffeine from foods and beverages is able to cross the placenta and becomes part of breast milk. Yet, most research finds that pregnant and nursing mothers can consume moderate amounts of caffeine safely. Moderate caffeine intake during pregnancy is about 200 mg/day, which is equal to about two 8-ounce cups of coffee or four cups of tea a day. A 12-ounce caffeinated soft drink contains about 37 mg of caffeine, while an 8-ounce energy drink has about 100 mg. It is important to read the food labels on foods and beverages to be aware of how much caffeine they contain.Some women may have heard about a link between caffeine and miscarriage. There have been many studies on whether caffeine increases miscarriage risk. Yet the results are unclear. Leading health expertsagree that200 mg caffeine perday or less during pregnancy is safe. Talk to your health care provider about your caffeine intake if you have a history of heart problems or high blood pressure.Low-calorie sweeteners Low-calorie sweeteners are safe for the general public, including pregnant women. The FDA and other leading authorities affirm their safety. Eight low-calorie sweeteners allowed for use in foods and as tabletop sweeteners. They are acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), advantame, aspartame, neotame, saccharin, sucralose, monk fruit extract, and stevia leaf extract. Studies show that they are all safe to consume during pregnancy.Anyone with phenylketonuria (PKU) must restrict their intake of phenylalanine from all sources. This includes aspartame. PKU is a genetic disorder that prevents the breakdown of phenylalanine. Phenylanine is present in aspartame and many other foods. Pregnant women who have the PKU gene but not the PKU disorder can digest aspartame safely.SodiumSodium is a very important, natural part of fluids in the human body. Sodium works with other minerals to keep water balance in the body. It is also critical for a healthy nervous system and muscle coordination.Sodium needs and limits for pregnant women are not different from the general population. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium intake to 2,300 mg or less per day. Excessive sodium intake has been linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and other health conditions.Other Nutrition SourcesVitamin/Mineral SupplementsA balanced diet meets most nutrient needs. Still, your health care provider may recommend you take a daily multivitamin as well. These can also be helpful if you plan to become pregnant. Taken a few months before conception, an over-the-counter prenatal vitamin may help resolve any nutritional deficiencies.More vitamin and/or mineral supplementation may be important for certain groups. For example, you may need to supplement your diet if you are a strict vegan or follow a restrictive diet. Additional supplementation may also be beneficial if you are carrying twins or triplets. Consider taking a calcium supplement (600 milligrams per day) plus Vitamin D if you are a vegan, are under 25, or do not consume dairy. Also, vitamin B12 supplements (and perhaps vitamin D and zinc) for strict vegans.Pregnant women should not take Vitamin A supplements. Excessive levels of Vitamin A could be toxic to the developing baby. You can meet your vitamin A needs with a healthful diet and a prenatal multivitamin.Herbal and Botanical SupplementsThere is no scientific evidence to support benefits from herbal and botanical products during pregnancy. In fact, some herbal products may have serious side effects for both mom and baby. For these reasons, pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid herbal and botanical supplements.Alcohol and PregnancyDrinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause permanent physical, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities. Do not consume alcohol during pregnancy. Also, women who are trying to get pregnant should not drink alcohol. Many women do not know they are pregnant until they are four to six weeks into the pregnancy. Drinking even small amounts during this time could expose their developing baby to alcohol. Women should stop drinking alcohol as soon as they find out they are pregnant.Weight Gain during PregnancyIt is important to track your weight gain during pregnancy. This helps to make sure that both you and your baby are healthy. Women who gain too little weight are at risk of having a small baby (less than 5 1/2 pounds). Yet women who gain too much weight have a greater risk of having the baby early or having a large baby. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also lead to other health problems. These may include gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and varicose veins in the mother.Pregnant women store fat to prepare for breastfeeding. If you are below your target pregnancy weight, your health care provider will carefully track your progress. Also, ask your health care provider or a registered dietitian to help with meal planning. This will help ensure that you get the nutrients and calories you need for proper weight gain.Goals for Weight GainWeight gain goals are based on pre-pregnancy weight, height, age, and usual eating patterns. Every woman and every pregnancy is unique. Your healthcare provider can help you gain weight at a healthy rate throughout pregnancy.A weight gain of 25 to 35 pounds is normal for women with a body mass index, or BMI, of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 (""normal weight""). BMI is one way to determine if you are at an appropriate weight. This tool can determine how much weight you should gain during pregnancy. Women who are below healthy weight when they conceive (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) should aim to gain about 28 to 40 pounds. Women with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 (""overweight"") should gain no more than 15 to 25 pounds. Go to http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/ to calculate your individual BMI.Women with a BMI over 30 kg/m2 (""obese"") should gain no more than 11 to 20 pounds. If you are in this category, a health care provider or registered dietitian can help you meet these recommendations in a healthy way. Aim to meet your calorie and nutrient needs, while maintaining regular physical activity. Weight loss during pregnancy is not advised.If you are carrying more than one baby, weight gain recommendations increase. Women with a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 should gain 37-54 pounds. Women with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 should gain 31-50 pounds. Women with a BMI over 30 kg/m2 should aim to gain 25-42 pounds. There are no set guidelines for weight gain for underweight (BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2) women carrying more than one baby. Work closely with your health care provider to ensure proper weight gain.Pattern of Weight GainPatterns of weight gain during pregnancy are as important as total weight gain. Your health care provider will keep records of your height and weight starting on the first prenatal visit. Regular weigh-ins will be recorded at each visit to make sure you are gaining weight at the proper rate.Weight maintenance or slight weight losses are normal during the first trimester (or first 13 weeks) of pregnancy. But most women should expect to gain about four to five pounds during the first trimester. Weight gain should come from the nutrient-rich foods described earlier in this resource. Listen to your bodys signals and stop eating when you feel full. This will help keep you from overeating because youre eating for two.Women with healthy pre-pregnancy weights should gain about one pound a week during the second and third trimesters. Women who are underweight before conception should gain a little more than one pound per week. Those who were initially overweight should gain at a slower rate (a little more than a half a pound per week).Food Cravings and AversionsFood cravings and dislikes of certain foods are common during pregnancy. There is no evidence that food cravings are linked to nutritional deficiencies. Their cause remains a mystery. It is acceptable to meet your food cravings within reason. Especially when they supply nutrients to the diet.In rare cases, some pregnant women crave nonfood substances. This is a disorder called pica. The consumption of nonfood items can be dangerous for both mother and baby. In some cases, pica involves eating large amounts of nonfood. This can prevent you from getting enough calories or nutrients to stay healthy. Examples of these nonfood items include clay, starch, ice, coffee grounds, or baking soda. If you experience nonfood cravings, talk to your health care provider right away. These symptoms may be a sign of nutrient deficiency (such as Iron), and may need to be treated with an additional supplement.Physical ActivityPhysical activity is another critical part of good health. Include 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity on most, if not all, days of the week. Try activities like walking or swimming. But avoid activities that have a high risk of falling or injury. If you already do vigorous activities (like running), you can continue them throughout your pregnancy. Discuss adjustments to the activity with your health care provider. Some women cannot fit 30 minutes of one time at one time into their schedules. Feel free to split up the time into three 10-minute intervals throughout the day.Being Smart About Food Safety Food safety is important for everyone. There are certain foods that pose an extra risk to pregnant women and their unborn babies. In particular, pregnant women should be aware of their increased risk of listeriosis.Listeriosis Listeriosis is a dangerous infection caused by bacteria often found in soil, ground water, and on plants. Refrigerated, ready-to-eat foods such as meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy may contain listeria. Also, unpasteurized (raw) milk and products made with raw milk may contain these bacteria. Listeria can be dangerous for pregnant women and their unborn babies. Listeriosis, the infection caused by listeria, can cause many dangers for mother and baby. These include premature delivery, miscarriage, fetal death, and severe illness of the newborn.Symptoms of listeriosis can take a few days or even weeks to appear and can be mild. You may not even know you have listeriosis. This makes practicing proper food safety even more critical. Listeriosis can have flu-like symptoms at first. These include sudden onset of fever, chills, muscle aches, diarrhea, and/or upset stomach. Other symptoms could include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions. A blood test can determine if you have listeriosis, and it can be treated with antibiotics. This can also prevent the fetus from contracting the infection.Avoid certain foods during pregnancy to prevent listeriosis. These include:Hot dogs, luncheon or deli meats, unless they are reheated until steaming hot.Soft cheeses such as feta, Brie, Camembert, and blue-veined cheeseSoft Mexican-style cheeses (queso blanco fresco). Unless they are labeled as made with pasteurized milk.Deli salads such as ham salad, chicken salad, egg salad, tuna salad, or seafood salad.Refrigerated meat-based pt or spreads.Refrigerated smoked seafood, unless it is an ingredient in a cooked dish such as a casserole.Raw (unpasteurized) milk or foods that contain unpasteurized milk.Mercury in FishFish contains high-quality protein and other essential nutrients. It is also low in saturated fat, and contains healthy omega-3 fats. These fats contribute to heart health, brain development and childrens proper growth and development. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines encourage pregnant and breastfeeding women to eat a 2-3 meals (8-12 ounces) of seafood each week.All popular types of fish in the U.S. are healthy, low in mercury and safe to eat during pregnancy. These include salmon, tuna (light canned), and tilapia. All seafood contains trace (very, very small) amounts of mercury. But only four types of fish should be avoided during pregnancy due to their mercury content. These higher-mercury fish are tilefish, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel.ConclusionFood has a big role in maintaining the health of both mothers and their babies. Practice good nutrition and food safety habits during pregnancy. These can have lifelong benefits for you and your child. Eat a mix of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, lean meats, and beans. All food groups provide essential nutrients to your diet. Also, remember that certain foods may pose health risks to the mother and unborn baby. Choose foods based on the principles of balance, variety, and moderation. This is the best approach to enjoying a healthy eating plan during pregnancy and for a lifetime.A Message from the American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA)PAs are licensed health professionals, and valued members of a health care team that includes a supervising physician.

Everything You Need to Know About Aspartame - IFIC ...



... Can pregnant and breastfeeding women consume aspartame? Yes. Foods and beverages containing aspartame can be ... 

      http://www.foodinsight.org/articles/everything-you-need-know-about-aspartame    

",http://www.foodinsight.org/articles/everything-you-need-know-about-aspartame,"What is Aspartame?Reviewed by theAmerican Academy of Physician Assistants			Download thePDFto view this entire brochure.Aspartame is a low-calorie sweetener that provides sweetness to foods and beverages without adding significant calories. Nutrition and fitness experts agree that balancing the calories you consume with the calories you burn is important for health. Aspartame can play a role in weight management programs that combine sensible nutrition and physical activity.Aspartame has been studied extensively and has been found to be safe by experts and researchers. Government agencies worldwide, including the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), have also reviewed the science and found aspartame to be safe for human consumption.Aspartame consists of two amino acids (the building blocks of protein)  phenylalanine and aspartic acid. It is about 200 times sweeter than sugar, so very small amounts of aspartame are needed to provide the same sweet taste. Aspartame is available as a tabletop sweetener and in many products, including a variety of beverages, dairy products, canned fruits, desserts, confections, sauces and dressings. In addition to helping with weight management, aspartame does not cause dental cavities and may be consumed by people with diabetes.How many calories are in aspartame?Aspartame has four calories per gram. However, because it is 200 times sweeter than sugar, aspartame is used in very small amounts, thus adding almost no calories to foods and beverages. As a result, when aspartame is substituted for calorie-containing sweeteners, total calories in foods and beverages are significantly reduced (and sometimes eliminated entirely, such as in diet soda, tea, and flavored seltzer water). It is important to remember that there are other sources of calories in many foods and beverages  sugar-free does not always mean calorie-free. The calorie content of a food or beverage can be found in the Nutrition Facts Panel located on the product label.How does aspartame fit into a healthful diet?Aspartame and other low-calorie sweeteners add sweetness to foods and beverages without adding significant calories. Substituting aspartame for sugar or other calorie-containing sweeteners, like agave nectar and honey, can help people consume fewer calories throughout the day. For example, drinking just one aspartame-sweetened soft drink (look for diet versions of your favorite beverages, which often contain aspartame and/or another low-calorie sweetener) instead of a regular soft drink saves about 150 calories  see the chart to the right for other examples of calorie savings that can be achieved with aspartame-sweetened foods and beverages. These calorie savings can add up over time. Several studies have shown that such changes can reduce daily calories and help with weight loss and weight management.Is aspartame safe to consume?Yes. The FDA has confirmed that aspartame is safe for the general population, including certain sub-populations like children, people with diabetes and women who are pregnant or nursing. The single exception is individuals with a rare hereditary condition called phenylketonuria (PKU). People with PKU cannot metabolize phenylalanine, an amino acid that is found in aspartame, as well as meat, beans, and many other foods. Individuals with PKU should avoid foods containing phenylalanine, including aspartame. Foods and beverages sweetened with aspartame carry a statement on the label to alert people who have PKU to the presence of phenylalanine.The safety of aspartame is supported by government bodies and leading independent health groups around the globe. Some of the many groups that have made official statements confirming the safety of aspartame include the American Diabetes Association, the American Dietetic Association, and the National Cancer Institute of the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Anecdotal reports of negative effects are not supported by the large body of scientific evidence and have not warranted any changes to aspartames use in countries worldwide (see Aspartames Global Safety Recognition on the back of this brochure).More than 200 studies support the safety of aspartame. Experts, researchers and government bodies agree that people (other than individuals with PKU) can consume a variety of foods and beverages sweetened with aspartame on a daily basis without concern.A large body of well-designed and widely-accepted research has found no association between aspartame and cancer. This conclusion has been re-affirmed recently by leading health and food safety regulatory authorities around the world, including the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) and FDA. A few isolated studies in laboratory rats and mice have alleged a link between aspartame and cancer; however, leading scientists and regulatory agencies in the U.S. and internationally have found that the conclusions of these studies are not valid, due to significant problems with the design and interpretation of the studies.Can people who have diabetes consume sweet foods and beverages containing aspartame?Yes. Foods and beverages containing aspartame are safe for people who have diabetes. Products containing aspartame provide sweet, good-tasting options that are low in carbohydrates, which are useful for people who have diabetes and who must monitor their carbohydrate intake.People who have diabetes should talk with a registered dietitian, health care professional, and/ or certified diabetes educator for advice on incorporating foods and beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners into their diets.Can pregnant and breastfeeding women consume aspartame?Yes. Foods and beverages containing aspartame can be part of a healthful diet for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Research has shown that aspartame has no adverse effects on expecting or nursing mothers. For women who consumed moderate amounts of foods and beverages containing low-calorie sweeteners before becoming pregnant, theres no need to eliminate them; however, they should also be sure to consume the necessary nutrients for their babys growth during pregnancy and breastfeeding as advised by their physician or health care professional.Does aspartame cause weight gain?No. Several studies have shown that low-calorie sweeteners, such as aspartame, can actually aid in weight loss and/or weight management when combined with a balanced diet and regular physical activity. For example, a study of people participating in a comprehensive weight loss program found that those who replaced products sweetened with sugar with those sweetened with aspartame lost weight. Aspartame also appeared to help with long-term weight maintenance.A few small studies measuring self-reported hunger for a few hours in subjects who unknowingly consumed aspartame have suggested that low-calorie sweeteners may lead to cravings and/or weight gain. However, carefully designed studies that placed low-calorie sweeteners, including aspartame, into the diet over a period of weeks, without the subjects knowledge, have repeatedly reported reduced calorie intake and body weight. Such studies affirm that low-calorie sweeteners like aspartame are useful as weight loss/weight management aids.Is aspartame safe for children?Yes. There is no evidence that aspartame is harmful to children or other members of the general population (again, except for those with PKU). In fact, foods and beverages containing aspartame can be part of a healthful meal plan for children when included as part of a balanced diet rich in nutrients. It can be challenging to put together good-tasting, healthful meals and snacks for children and adolescents that provide important nutrients, but not a lot of extra calories. Incorporating some low-calorie, sugar-free foods and beverages may help improve the overall quality of the diet, while helping to keep weight in check. Registered dietitians and physicians can help parents make the right choices based on the childs individual calorie and nutrition needs.Aspartames Global Safety RecognitionAspartame was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in 1981 for use in foods, followed by approval for use in beverages in 1983. In 1996, aspartame was approved as a general purpose sweetener. Prior to its approval, aspartame underwent a thorough scientific review, and regulators consider it one of the most widely-tested ingredients in the food supply. It is now approved for use in 136 countries worldwide. Examples of government and scientific groups that have reviewed aspartames safety include:European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO)/ World Health Organization (WHO) Joint Expert Committee on Food Additives (JECFA)Health CanadaFood Standards Australia/New Zealand (FSANZ)Foods and Beverages That May Contain AspartameMore than 6,000 products marketed in more than 100 countries worldwide use aspartame as a sweetener. These food and beverage products include some:Carbonated and other beverages (juices, iced tea, flavored waters, etc.)CerealsChewing gumsDairy products (low-fat flavored milk, light yogurt, etc.)Canned fruitsDesserts (light pudding, light ice cream, popsicles, etc.)Nutrition barsSyrups and fruit spreadsTabletop sweetenersAspartame is not very heat stable; therefore, it is not recommended for use in baking or in cooking methods that require extended exposure to high temperatures. Although there is no safety concern with doing so, the flavor breaks down, reducing the sweetness of the final product. Aspartame is typically used in prepared foods and beverages that do not require heating during preparation. Aspartame can also be added to a cup of coffee or tea."

",http://www.foodinsight.org/pages/case-study-Bisphenol-A-in-baby-bottles,"October 3, 2014Written with Elizabeth L. Petrun, Ph.D. Bisphenol A1. Introduction and Case Overview Bisphenol A (BPA) is a man-made chemical used in polycarbonate plastic and epoxy resins (WHO, 2013). BPA is often incorporated into packaging materials, that can accompany food and beverages, which has since sparked debate over the chemicals safety. The substance was first developed in 1891, when it was tested as a synthetic estrogen hormone to help women with issues ranging from menstruation and nausea during pregnancy to menopause (Bell, 1995). In the 1990s, researchers realized that the chemical was migrating from plastics into water, starting the current debate about its use in packaging and impacts on consumer safety (Krishnan, Stathis, Permuth, Tokes, Feldman, 1993).Currently, these epoxy resins are widely used as a protective lining on the inside of metal-based food and beverage cans to prevent corrosion and minimize the risk of food contamination (Lofstedt, 2011). Manufacturers also rely on BPA to make a durable and heat resistant plastic called polycarbonate, frequently used as an alternative to glass in containers for food and beverages (Vogel, 2009).1.2 Nature of Hazard When Krishnan et al. (1993) observed that the chemical was migrating from polycarbonate laboratory bottles into the water they contained, after about 100 years of use BPA was thrust into the arena of hazards as if the chemical was new or recently altered. This study raised concern that BPA might be unintentionally consumed by persons from food and beverage packing; and as a potential endocrine disrupter could affect reproductive, breast, prostate, and overall health in addition to damage the brains neurobehavioral functioning (Lofstedt, 2011).At the time, BPA was only suspected as a hazard. Further evaluation was still needed to determine if there was indeed any significant risk to consumers.1.3 Who, What, and How are we Affected? A majority of scientific evidence suggests that BPA poses no immediate risk to human health when measured in realistic exposure levels (e.g. levels most humans would likely encounter in everyday life) (Health Canada, 2012; WHO, 2010). However, many groups have misgivings and misperceptions about the safety of BPA. These concerns include:Manufacturers who use epoxy coatings in packaging,Producers of the food and beverage products contained therein,Consumers who purchase and consume products affiliated with BPA, andHealth officials and regulatory agencies responsible for public safety.1.4 Historical Background Dr. Frederick vom Saal of the University of Missouri tested artificial estrogens, including BPA, following Stanfords research (Lofstedt, 2011). He published his first paper in 1997, which found that estrogenic responses were higher than anticipated (Nagel et al, 1997). vom Saals early studies were conducted on a small sample of mice or rats and did not meet the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) test guidelines; nor OECDs defined Good Laboratory Practice (Lofstedt, 2011). vom Saals studies were certainly questionable, yet they revealed that very low exposure to BPA, through intravenous or oral injection, might induce serious health effects. His studies spurred the concern for health problems that include reproductive abnormalities, obesity, breast and prostate cancer, and neurobehavioral problems in those mice (vom Saal & Hughes, 2005).Regulators and risk assessors in the United States and Europe, including the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), examined vom Saals research but found his research to be unreliable based on unlikely reproducibility and small sample sizes (Lofstedt, 2011). Even with questionable research methodology, the fallout surrounding BPA studies in the 1990s still creates concern for many stakeholders.EFSAs more recent 2008 BPA panel concluded that BPA was safer than initially thought and even considered increasing the Tolerable Daily Intake (EFSA, 2008). Still, in October 2008, a number of articles in the Toronto Globe and Mail referenced the work of vom Saal and others. The articles were highly critical of the use of BPA; Health Canada (the Canadian food and health regulatory agency) decided to ban BPA from baby bottles (Layton & Lee, 2008).Weeks later, the heavy-hitter retailer Wal-Mart announced that they would not sell baby bottles containing BPA (Gunther, 2008).FDA began to look more closely at BPA again in the fall of 2008. In December 2008, FDA found that data surround BPA remained inconclusive at best, and chose not to ban the chemical on speculative evidence. Since this decision, advocates at both the state and national level continue to press for action. By January 2011, nine states banned the use of BPA in baby bottles and other childrens packaging (Lofstedt, 2011). Other states are still considering bans (Crowley-Koch, 2013).In the wake of recent advocacy campaigns, some industries have sought other alternative to BPA laden packaging. Some have reverted to older technologies with limited applications  as new alternatives were not yet available or still under development. Even without concrete scientific evidence industry began to reduce the production and use of BPAcontaining bottles and infant feeding cups.Even though BPA research has yet to indicate need for legitimate health concerns, a series of contradictory or confusing actions by government agencies, health authorities, media, and key stakeholders around the globe continued to elevate levels of public concern. These actions include: European Union (E.U.) member states who voted to back a proposal to ban BPA in baby feeding bottles, The divide that erupted between member states with the United Kingdom Food Standards Agency and Germanys Federal Risk Institute, who found BPA to be safe at current levels,The French National Assembly voted to ban the use of BPA in food contact materials in 2014 and in packaging for food and drink that target young children in 2013, andTaiwans FDA equivalent announced a ban on the use of BPA in baby bottles beginning 2013. Many regulatory agencies continued to conduct new experiments, but did not ban BPA in absence of substantial evidence of detrimental health outcomes. Even though many regulatory bodies find BPA safe, the chemical has been virtually eliminated around the globe. Further, BPAs use in many other aspects of food packaging is also in jeopardy, despite fifty years of safe and productive use.1.5 Levels of Risk and Levels of Exposure United StatesUS FDA initially discussed agency concern for the possible effects of BPA on childrens health, in addition to new research on the chemicals effects in 2010 (FDA, 2013).In March 2012, the FDA rejected a petition from the advocacy group National Center for Toxicological Research that called for a ban on BPA for food and beverage packaging (Walsh, 2012). FDA found no compelling scientific evidence to justify the petitioned restrictions, but maintained current research studies on BPA. Three months later, FDA accepted a petition to prohibit the use of BPA in infant formula containers. but initially denied the ban as it also related to small reusable containers and canned food packaging (FDA, 2013). A month later, FDA announced that their rule permitting the use of BPA in baby bottles and sippy cups would be phased out by October 2012, as the chemical was no longer in common use for these applications. The agency further emphasized that this should not be misinterpreted as an issue of safety.By March 2013, FDA updated its current perspective on BPA. More specifically, FDA (2013) finds that: BPA is safe at the very low levels that occur in some foods. Additionally, the agency does not recommend that families change use of infant formula or foods, as the benefit of a stable source of good nutrition outweighs the potential risk of BPA exposure (FDA, 2013). FDAs current assessment was based on review by FDA scientists, considering hundreds of studies, which all still failed to produce reasonable doubt of the chemicals safety.World Health Organization (WHO) and Health CanadaIn fall 2010, an international panel of experts convened by WHO and Health Canada concluded that, while food is by far the main source of BPA exposure for consumers, circulating levels in the body are very low (WHO, 2010). The finding suggests that BPA is not accumulated in the body and is rapidly eliminated through urine. While a few recent experimental and epidemiological studies found associations between low BPA exposure and some adverse health outcomes, initiation of public health measure would be premature. A second panel in February 2011 reached the same opinion.Health CanadaHealth Canada last updated its position BPA in August 2008. Since 2008, however, Health Canada has conducted additional surveys to measure concentrations of BPA in canned food and drinks, bottled water, soft drinks, beer, and Total Diet samples (Health Canada, 2012). Considering new evidence and testing, Health Canadas Food Directorate continues to conclude that current dietary exposure to BPA through food packaging uses is not expected to pose a health risk to the general population (2012). This finding is also identified as being consistent with other countries, including the United States, the E.U., and Japan (Health Canada, 2012).EuropeIn November 2011, as a follow-up to a request by the European Commission, EFSA published its report on the health effects of BPA (EFSA, 2011a).This was in response to the earlier reports by Frances Agency for Food, Environmental and Occupational Health & Safety (ANSES). The EFSA panel concluded that the information in the ANSES report did not change their views on the safety of BPA, and there was no need to revise the current TDI of 0.05 mg/kg bodyweight which was set in 2006 and reaffirmed in 2008 (EFSA, 2011a).The EFSA report acknowledged uncertainties about BPA-related effects in rodents at low-dose levels, saying that their panel would reconsider its opinion following evaluation of new studies that would be available from the U.S. in 2012 (EFSA, 2011b).The European Commission asked countries such as Belgium, France and Sweden, which were pushing ahead with national BPA restrictions in the absence of E.U. measures, to hold off until EFSA completed its opinion.In a July 25, 2013 Press Release, EFSAs scientific experts announced that they had provisionally concluded that for all population groups diet is the major source of exposure to BPA, and exposure was considerably lower than previously estimated (EFSA, 2013). For infants and toddlers (aged 6 months to 3 years) average exposure from the diet was newly estimated to amount to 375 nanograms per kilogram of body weight per day (ng/kg bw/day) whereas for the population above 18 years of age (including women of child-bearing age) the figure was up to 132 ng/kg bw/day (EFSA, 2013).By comparison, these estimates are less than 1% of the current Tolerable Daily Intake (TDI) for BPA (0.05 milligrams/kg bw/day) established by EFSA in 2006 (EFSA, 2013). EFSA is now seeking feedback on this draft assessment. Next, EFSA will publicly consult on the human health aspects of its risk assessment prior to finalizing its scientific opinion. In the interests of openness and transparency, EFSA notes it will continue to provide regular updates on the progress of this important scientific work (EFSA, 2013).1.6 Ability to Control the RiskThe actual risk associated with BPA has been continuously speculative, and findings from the FDA, WHO, Health Canada, and EFSA have only reaffirmed the absence of documented harm. Further, at the time of heightened public scrutiny, the only means through which industries could minimize the damage imposed by perceived BPA risk was to avoid using any products with the chemical.The impact of perceived risk encouraged industries to avoid BPA products and seek out alternative packaging measures, even though empirical evidence was missing. Worse, some manufacturers could be switching to alternatives that have less evidence of safety in use. These alterative chemicals or packaging could pose an even higher level of risk to consumers  without legitimate reason.1.7 Level of Communication Required: Level Public Health Impact/ Level Public InterestThis case required several levels of communication. Each level targeted different audiences with myriad perspectives. To begin, there was a need to communicate to the scientific community to obtain additional data and research findings. This happened with the FDA, who needed to resume BPA research activity. Secondly, there was a need to communicate the rationale for new research to BPA manufacturers and to food and beverage producers that used BPA in their packaging. Unfortunately for persons in associated BPA industries, the mere action of FDA engaging in more research can signal to consumers that something is wrong or concerning.Next, men, women, and children needed information surrounding the reason for new BPA research. They needed to know if they should be wary of health issues, products to avoid, or new information. Relatedly, new mothers needed to know about possible effects on their children. Finally, food and beverage producers and their customers needed to consider how to protect their brand images and reputations as organizations that legitimately produced and sold safe products.In all cases, it was essential to consider public perceptions of the use of chemicals and to provide accurate, complete, and timely information for stakeholders so that they could make informed decisions about BPA and their health.Complicating matters further, differing reactions to terminology and messaging also ought to be considered. While scientists and regulatory officials would be familiar with chemicals, and their threshold levels and effects on human health, non-expert publics will not know these nuances. As such, identified risks are difficult to register and are more black and white instead of a more sophisticated gray. Communication surrounding risk should be adapted and tailored to serve each identified target audience.1.8 Emergency and Non-Emergency Situations BPA discussions from the 1990s forward have evolved from a non-emergency to an emergency situation. This shifted is marked by the perceptual threat brought forth to this issue by both faulty science and activist groups. At best, there is only a suspicion of possible risk associated with BPA and speculation is not enough to fuel policy change and heightened regulation.When Health Canada banned BPA in baby bottles, manufacturers and users faced a legitimate crisis. This crisis though was not about health, but rather about rumors which further fueled BPA stakeholders legitimacy crisis.1.9 Event Timelines See section 1.3.1.10 Uncertainty Identification This case contains a large element of uncertainty. In fact, uncertainty is what can fuel a majority of stress, worry, and damage to stakeholders tasked with decision-making. In this case it was unclear (a) what the true risk was, (b) who should worry about it, (c) where changes would take place, (d) why the FDA was conducting research involving BPA if it was safe, and more. Beginning in 2008, little information existed to answer these questions.2. Evidence and Application of the Principles and Best Practices for Risk Communication in the Case2.2 Openness: Yes, definitely.2.3 Transparency: Yes, definitely.2.4 Present risk message with honesty: Messages were presented with sincerity, not necessarily clarity, neutrality and objectivity.2.5 Credibility of Information Sources The public and media struggled to understand messaging from food safety and health agencies.Though his research lacked a high level of scientific validation, vom Saal was widely perceived as a credible source by the media and health advocates creating tension and uncertainty with several stakeholder groups. This tension is met by research conducted over the years by industry, which has been widely accepted by United States and international food safety agencies. Stakeholder may be left thinking: Who do I believe? and what do I think is right?This raises the question as to whether regulatory bodies made sufficient effort to tailor their communication messages to make this process more understandable to consumers.2.6 Responsiveness and Timeliness From the point of view of commissioning, executing and reporting new scientific research, the responsiveness was exemplary and the time frame would probably have been considered as accelerated by the scientific community.From the point of view of the consumer, it has taken years to come to even an interim conclusion, and will take at least another year until 2014 for further results. Again, this raises the question as to whether regulatory bodies made sufficient effort to tailor their communication messages to make this process more understandable to consumers.These differences in perspective continue to point to the need for bridges between the scientific and non-expert communities.2.7 Channels and ToolsFood safety agencies typically use press conferences, press releases and posting information online to discuss their issues. Public health and risk assessment officials addressed the media, and through the media, the public at large.2.8 Message developmentFew health and regulatory agency spokespersons were highly trained in communicating food risk to the public and to the non-expert stakeholder. Communications were generally objective, science-based, and data laden from recent assessments and observations regarding regulatory oversight and its application. They were rarely personal, empathetic, reassuring and easily understood by the lay public.Conversely, communications by advocacy groups and agents for change in academia, politics, and public policy circles used rhetoric, emotion, and memorable quotes and sound bites through the media to elevate levels of concern. They also swayed public opinion and seek to force changes in regulation and food production practices that were unsubstantiated by the currently available scientific evidence.2.9 Acknowledge and Explain Uncertainty It is important to both acknowledge and explain uncertainties. Still, acknowledging the uncertainties, while failing to offer clear guidance on how stakeholders and the public might best respond while investigations continued, undoubtedly raised the level of public anxiety and precipitated disproportionate responses by producers, users, stakeholders and consumers.2.10 Communication about Risk Mitigation MeasuresA promise of ongoing scientific research is hardly reassuring to confused and concerned stakeholders. More concrete, established evidence is needed to foster certainty in affected groups.2.11 Risk Perceptions Identified in Target Populations2.12 Design Risk Messages to be Culturally Sensitive/ Reflect Culture Values and Social Sensitivity2.13 Acknowledge Diverse Levels of Risk Tolerance Knowing your Audience 2.14 Involve the Public in Dialogue About Risk 2.15 Meet Risk Perception Needs by Remaining Open and Accessible2.16 Collaborate and Coordinate about with Credible Information Sources2.17 Collaborate with Regulatory Agencies and Industry Groups2.18 Infuse Risk Communication into Policy Decisions Answers to points 2.11 to 2.18All of the aforementioned areas needed more consideration and work in this case. The court of public opinion was left wide open for manipulation by special interest groups, political pressures, and advocates for change. Scientifically based evidence with clear communication concerning the real and perceptual concerns of stakeholders was minimized in comparison to other emotionally charged arguments.Media observations suggest that the European Commission could have more openly and publicly urged countries, much sooner, not to take premature measures without EFSAs findings.FDA clearly stated they had not changed their regulatory position on BPA while they continued to review new research and scientific evidence. U.S. media, however, interpreted this as exactly the opposite construing FDA investigations for legitimate present threat.3. Lessons Learned and Implications Drawn from the use of Risk Communication Best Practices 3.2 Increased attention is needed to identify impacted stakeholders and the differing levels of risk perception of each impacted sector. Accomplishing this task requires resources for original research and environmental scanning. Clearly, more information is needed to understand how certain audiences process risk.3.3 Message development and communication channels need to meet the communication needs of all implicated target audiences.3.4 Press conferences should provide empathetic, clear and unambiguous statements to the media that can be readily re-quoted and disseminated.3.5 Promises of future research, risk assessment, and exposure assessments do not reassure potentially vulnerable populations. They may need more explanation and rational to understand why more information is needed on issues in absence of existing risk.3.6 Communication can mistakably amplify doubt, and uncertainties may hasten commercial decisions by those concerned with reputational management and protecting or increasing market share. In these cases, decisions that are grounded in objective food safety risk assessment become less important than organizational or market survival.Organizations affiliated with industries at risk for perceptual challenges must proactively address emerging issues before they evolve to crisis. Unfortunately, market shifts most likely signify that perceptions of a product or practice have occurred, and involved industries will either be forced to back pedal or engage in a much larger response that might have been avoided with more significant communication in the pre-crisis or risk communication phases.3.7 It is vitally important that regulatory, food safety, and health agencies find a more effective way ongoing research is needed without fueling the perception that there is, or there most likely is a yet-to-be proven, elevated level of risk.Considering the expertise demanded to fully understanding the rationale, methodology, and findings from studies many agencies might consider placing more attention on internal employees tasked with public relations, public information, or marketing. These positions should emphasize and handle the need for clear, concise, and accessible public information. 3.8 Disproportionate risk management decisions may present short-term advantages to certain stakeholders or special interest groups. However, this short-term focus shifts attention away from legitimate or actual risks, which creates major inconsistencies in issue management and crisis response. By implication, the consistent application of risk management measures that are in proportion to the level of risk determined by objective risk assessment is a better way to ensure food safety and, in doing so, maintain and build trust among stakeholders and consumers.3.9 Transparency, cooperation and consistency in communications builds understanding and trust.3.10 Confusing and conflicting messages invariably elevate levels of concern and erode trust, often creating unanticipated consequences that would not be warranted by objective assessments. What remains important is also the necessity to ensure heightened international collaboration on risk communication issues  as many stakeholders look to international sources to make health decisions. Inconsistent global consensus is troubling, particularly because regulatory agencies and governments who are perceived to be credible fail to articulate consensus on BPA, leaving stakeholders wondering, Who exactly should I trust?ReferencesFood and Drug Administration (FDA).

Healthy Mother, Healthy Baby: Prenatal Nutrition 101



... Healthy Mother, Healthy Baby: Prenatal Nutrition 101. By Food ... Your baby-to-be needs those extra calories. While pregnant ... 

      http://www.foodinsight.org/prenatal-nutrition-101-healthy-baby-mother    

",http://www.foodinsight.org/prenatal-nutrition-101-healthy-baby-mother,"There may never be another time in your life where you receive a doctors order to consume 300 more calories per day! Your baby-to-be needs those extra calories. While pregnant, eating a healthy diet is crucial to making sure your baby is getting all the essential nutrients to develop properly.Before we get started, keep in mind that weight gain is a normal part of pregnancy. Not everyone will gain the same amount and thats ok. Gaining the same amount of weight is not recommended for everyoneit depends on your starting BMI. Heres a link to the Institute of Medicines guidelines.What does a healthy diet look like for a pregnant woman?Pregnancy is special time in life, so it makes sense that you have special nutritional needs. Here are a few tips to help deliver a healthful diet while pregnant:1. Make half your plate fruits and vegetables. Fruits and vegetables remain an important source of vitamins and minerals during pregnancy.2. Make at least half of your grains whole. Whole grains offer key vitamins, minerals, and fiber. Enriched grains should be included in your diet, too. These grains have been fortified with B vitamins (thiamin, riboflavin, niacin and folate) and iron, all of which are important for healthy growth and development. So important, in fact, that in 1998, the United States FDA required folic acid be added to enriched flour to reduce the risk of neural tube birth defects.3. Choose fat-free or low-fat dairy. For example, try switching to skim or 1% milk. This can help reduce your saturated fat intake. Milk products (e.g., milk, yogurt, cheese and fortified soy beverages) can be an excellent source of vitamin D and calcium necessary for your babys bone growth.4. Make sure to get enough protein. Proteins main roles are to aid in growth, maintenance, and repair of cells, all of which your body needs for your babys development. Try varying your protein sources among plant-based and animal-based protein to assure you are consuming all the essential amino acids your body needs for healthy development.5. Fats are key components in cell membranes and brain and nervous tissue. All fat-containing foods contain a blend of fatsyoure never eating just one type in isolation. Its important to incorporate healthful unsaturated fats into your diet. Unsaturated fats are primarily found in foods such as vegetable oils, nuts, avocadoes, and fish. Monounsaturated fats help to lower LDL cholesterol (the kind you want less of) and maintain HDL cholesterol (the kind you want more of). Omega-3s and omega-6s are two types of polyunsaturated fats that can also help reduce total and LDL cholesterol when subbed for saturated and trans fats. Omega-3s also assist in visual and cognitive development of young infants.By following these tips for a healthy diet you will not only feel full after a meal, but will also ensure that you are consuming the essential vitamins and minerals needed for your babys health. To make sure you are covering all aspects of your babys developmental needs, additional supplementation may be recommended for the following vitamins and minerals:Folic acid/FolateFolic acid is the form of the vitamin you will find in dietary supplements, and folate is found in foods such as beans, peas, oranges, dark green leafy vegetables, and fortified grain products. It is recommended that pregnant women consume 600 micrograms (mcg) of dietary folate equivalents (DFEs) (the unit used on dietary supplement labels) every day to prevent brain and neural tube birth defects.CalciumCalcium is found in foods such as broccoli, dark green leafy greens, and fortified milk and orange juice. Calcium is important for many aspects of development, including strengthening your babys bones and teeth. It is recommended to consume 1,300 milligrams (mg) per day from diet, supplements, or a mixture of both.IronIron is found in red meat, poultry, fish, and fortified cereals and is critical for providing red blood cells with oxygen to the baby. The amount of iron recommended for pregnant women is 27 mg per day. For lactating women, the recommended amount per day is 9 mg. Its important to note that prenatal supplements alone can often contain the whole 27 mg, so read the label to determine how much youre receiving aside from foods.Vitamin DVitamin D can come from fortified milk, fatty fish such as salmon, mushrooms, and by spending time out in the sun. Even though no additional supplementation is recommended for pregnant women, it does work together with calcium to build bone and teeth, which makes it important to consume the recommended amount of 600 IU (15 mcg) per day.Eating healthy is only half the battle! Physical activity also plays an important role in a healthy pregnancy. The goal is to participate in physical activity for at least 2  hours per week, depending on your own limitations and your doctors approval. Walking, swimming, and low intensity exercise classes are all great ways to stay active!

Good Intentions that May Lead to Bad Outcomes: Home-Made ...

",http://www.foodinsight.org/Good_Intentions_that_May_Lead_to_Bad_Outcomes_Home_Made_Infant_Formula,"For newborn babies and infants, proper nutrition is vital to their healthy growth and development. For optimum nutrition benefits, mothers are encouraged to breastfeed their infants, but sometimes for various reasons they are either unable to, choose not to, or need to supplement breastfeeding.For those mothers who are not breastfeeding their infants, commercially prepared infant formula is the best alternative. These products have been, and continue to be, thoroughly tested for nutrient adequacy and safety. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) sets and enforces specific limits on safe levels of key ingredients, such as certain vitamins and minerals, for all commercially available infant formulas. Commercial infant formulas must meet all the requirements of the Infant Formula Act, which was developed to safeguard the nutritional health of infants, with very specific ingredient, manufacturing, testing, and labeling requirements.Despite the high standards and rigorous testing of commercially prepared infant formulas set by the FDA, some parents are concerned about the possible presence of ingredients in these products that have been developed through biotechnology. Some of these concerns stem from claims that biotechnology may cause food allergies. But, Wesley Burks, MD, pediatric allergist and chairman of the department of pediatrics at the University of North Carolina Medical School, assures us that foods developed using biotechnology do not lead to food allergies. Allergic disease truly has changed in the last 20 to 30 years. Theres lots of reasons why its differentTheres a hygiene hypothesis, changes in our gastrointestinal systemthe environmentThose \[reasons\] are much, much, much more likely to have a part in the change of allergic disease than anything related to food biotechnology. Its not even on my list of things that I think about because of what I know about the safety and approval process in the development of these foods. (IFIC Foundation videos, Physicians Offer Expert Advice on Food Biotechnology) In addition, trusted health organizations such as the American Medical Association have endorsed the responsible use of biotechnology to enhance food production.As a pediatrician and someone who takes care of children and often is speaking with moms who are pregnant, I feel that these foods are completely safe for children. I personally have reviewed the safety data and the evidence thats put together when these foods are about to be put into the general marketplace, and I find that these foods are completely safe. Theres no evidence that foods produced using biotechnology pose any risk to children or pregnant mothers.Ronald Kleinman, MD, pediatrician and physician in chief at Massachusetts General Hospital for Children (From the IFIC Foundation videos, Physicians Offer Expert Advice on Food Biotechnology)When it comes to concerns about the safety of foods produced with biotechnology for women and children, Laurie Green, MD, practicing obstetrician and gynecologist, and partner at the Pacific Women for OB/GYN Care in San Francisco, says, There are so many things people worry about. The things that would be really important like household products that might cause harm, it gets lost in the shuffle because theres almost too much information\[Biotech foods\] have been used for 20 years in 29 countries and consumed by millions and millions of people including pregnant women and children over nearly two decades. (IFIC Foundation videos, Physicians Offer Expert Advice on Food Biotechnology)Out of fear, some advocates have convinced parents that they should be concerned and that they should take matters into their own hands. While it is understandable that parents would want to take any measure possible to minimize a potential risk to their child, good intentions can sometimes lead to dangerous outcomes. For example, various individuals and organizations have taken to the internet to endorse homemade infant formula recipes as a way to avoid products containing ingredients produced with biotechnology; however, there are serious food safety risks of doing so that far outweigh any perceived risk of food biotechnology.Consumption of homemade formulas can lead to potentially serious health consequences for babies. There is no nutritional analysis for these home recipes, and consuming improper quantities of nutrients can cause poor growth and development. Some recipes call for the use of unpasteurized or raw milk, raising the risk of the presence of E. coli, Listeria, Campylobacter spp, or Salmonellapathogens that can cause serious health risks. Registered dietitian and director of nutrition at Washington University in St. Louis, Connie Diekman, MEd, RD, CSSD, LD, says, Consuming raw milk increases the potential risk of foodborne illness since the bacteria often found in milk have not been destroyed by pasteurization. Young children, pregnant women and those with compromised immune systems are especially at risk for getting sick when they consume raw milk. As a registered dietitian, I would discourage anyone from consuming raw milk.According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), commercial infant formula is the only safe source of food for nonbreastfed infants up to 6 months old and an important food source for nonbreastfed infants through their first year.Keith Ayoob, EdD, RD, FADA, a practicing pediatric nutritionist and associate professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Albert Einstein College of Medicine sums it up best: I can applaud the intent of mothers wanting to take an active role in feeding their infants when they can't breastfeed. This is an issue, however, where reality and safety have to trump intent. Commercially prepared formulas are far less risky than homemade baby formula. They provide complete nutrition for the infant; for a mother who cannot breastfeed, they are the go-to option.The AAP recommends that infants drink only breast milk or commercial infant formula until age 4 to 6 months, and to continue with breast milk or commercial infant formula until at least 12 months of age. In addition, because of digestion/absorption and other issues that can impact an infants growth and development, the AAP does not recommend introducing whole cows milk until after 12 months of age. When a child is ready for other foods to be introduced, the AAP also strongly recommends feeding products that have been pasteurized to kill bacteria and parasites often found in raw beverages. Robert V. Tauxe, MD, MPH, deputy director of the Centers for Disease Control and Preventions (CDC) Division of Foodborne, Waterborne, and Environmental Diseases, and co-author of the latest CDC report on attribution of foodborne illnesses to food commodities in the US, confirms that the CDC is concerned about the trend of consumers drinking raw milk and says, The practice of pasteurizing milk is one of the greatest public health achievements of the 20th century.Parents are strongly encouraged to discuss infant feeding issues and questions with an experienced health professional such as their childs personal pediatrician (and not the internet!) before embarking on a do-it-yourself infant formula experiment. Babies safety, health, development, and growth depend on it.For more information, go to:Why Formula Instead of Cow's Milk? AAP Healthy Children articleGot Milk?

",http://www.foodinsight.org/vitamin-b-complex-sources-amounts-riboflavin-niacin-folate-thiamine,"B vitamins primarily help our bodies convert food into fuel that we use for energy. While there are eight B vitamins found in foods, we are just going to focus on four: B1, B2, B3, and B9. (""Gaps"" in the numbering of B vitamins from 1 to 12 are substances that were discovered but were later not considered to be B vitamins, or were found to haveno nutritional value.) Most of these vitamins, often referred to as other names, are probably more recognizable. For example, vitamin B1 is commonly known as thiamine, vitamin B2 as riboflavin, vitamin B3 as niacin, and vitamin B9 as folate or folic acid. Read on to learn more about their health benefits, sources, and how much you should be aiming to incorporate into your diet.What other health benefits do these micronutrients have?Along with helping produce energy, B vitamins also enable the nervous system to function properly and are key for a healthy liver, skin, hair, and eyes. While many of these vitamins work together, each vitamin has its own specific roles and benefits. For example, vitamin B1 helps the body produce new cells and strengthens the immune system. Vitamin B2 works as an antioxidant, which protects cells and DNA from damage. It is also important for growth and red blood cell production. Vitamin B3 helps the body make hormones in your adrenal glands and helps suppress inflammation by improving circulation. And last but not least, vitamin B9 is necessary for proper brain function and is especially important at times when cells and tissues are growing rapidly, such as pregnancy.How much vitamin B1 should I aim for, and what foods should I focus on?Foods that are rich in vitamin B1 are bread and bread products, fortified cereal and meat substitutes, ham, pork, and whole grain foods.

",http://www.foodinsight.org/healthy-eating-pregnancy-nutrients-weight-gain-food-safety,"A healthy eating pattern is very important during pregnancy. Good nutrition plays a key role in the health of both mother and baby. As a mom-to-be, you have higher nutrient needs than you did before conception. Yet the general principles of good nutritionvariety, balance, and moderationstill apply during pregnancy.This resource will help you learn how to eat healthy during pregnancy. This includes how to choose a variety of healthy foods, maintain healthy weight gain during pregnancy, and stay food-safe.Click here to downloadA Balanced DietWhat a Mom-to-Be Needs Eating a balanced diet before, during, and after pregnancy is one part of good health. This section covers the key nutrients pregnant women need and where to find them.CaloriesCalorie (aka energy for the body) needs increase during pregnancy. But eating for two only requires an additional 340 calories during the second trimester and 500 calories in the third trimester. The first trimester does not require any extra calories.Choose foods and beverages that are nutrient-dense. This means that they good sources of the building blocks your body needs. Nutrient-dense foods are full of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. Eat variety of foods from all five food groups. These include grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy, and meat and beans. This will ensure that you and your growing baby are getting the nutrients you both need.Your nutrient and calorie needs are higher if you are carrying more than one baby. Discuss what and how much to eat with your health care provider.Key NutrientsProteinProtein helps maintain muscle and body tissue. It is also key for a babys growth  especially during the second and third trimesters. Most pregnant women should take in about 70 grams of protein every day to meet their minimum needs. Keep in mind you may need more than that. Protein requirements vary based on weight and activity level. Talk to your health care provider if you have questions about your daily protein intake. Lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and legumes (beans) are good sources of protein. These foods also supply iron, B vitamins, and other important nutrients. Dried beans, lentils, nuts, and soy products like tofu are other good sources of protein.If you are vegetarian, you can meet your protein needs by eating foods that are complete protein sources. A complete protein has all the essential building blocks (amino acids) your body needs. Each day, eat a variety of protein sources to provide your body with essential amino acids. Vegetarian protein options include beans, milk, yogurt, eggs, and soy products. Greek yogurt is another great option. It has twice the amount of protein when compared to regular yogurt. Pregnant vegans are able to meet their protein needs from soy, a complete protein source. Sources of soy protein include soy milk, soy cheese, soy yogurt, tofu, and tempeh. Examples of other protein-rich vegan foods are nuts and beans (red kidney beans, chickpeas, black beans, etc.).CarbohydratesCarbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body. Fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products contain carbohydrates. Whole grains are an important source of nutrients, such as dietary fiber. They also provide a variety of health benefits. Other important carbohydrate foods include enriched refined grains. These grains have the added benefit of iron and folic acid, two essential nutrients for the babys development. Many carbohydrate foods are great choices for breakfast. Including English muffins, yogurt, bagels, cereals, breads, and fruits. Other carbohydrate-containing choices for meals or snacks include crackers, bread, and pasta.Aim to get the majority of your daily calories from carbohydrates. For most people, carbohydrates should make up about 45 to 65 percent of daily calorie intake. Most pregnant and breastfeeding women need about 175-210 grams of carbohydrates per day.FatsFat is key for good nutrition, health, and storage of many important vitamins. Like carbohydrates and protein, dietary fat is an important source of energy for the body. Certain foods that contain fat supply the body with essential fatty acids. Essential fatty acids are fats that the body does not make, so they should be included in the diet. Most importantly, essential fatty acids are critical for the babys growth and development.Health experts recommend keeping total fat intake between 20 and 35 percent of total calories. Most fats should come from unsaturated sources. Sources of unsaturated fat include fish, vegetable oils (canola, soybean, olive, peanut, safflower, and sunflower oils), nuts, and flaxseeds. All women, including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should follow these recommendations.DHA is an unsaturated fat that is important for babies brain and eye development. Pregnant women should aim to get 200 mg of DHA per day. Oily fish such as salmon and tuna contain DHA. For example, a serving of salmon (3.5 ozor roughly the size of a deck of cards) has over 1g of DHA. This is five times the recommended amount. A health care provider may recommend a dietary supplement or prenatal vitamin with DHA. For more information on eating fish during pregnancy, see the Food Safety section.CalciumCalcium is important for the growth of strong bones and teeth. Calcium intake is necessary for all women. Especially pregnant women younger than 25 years old whose bones are still growing.Pregnant women should aim to consume 1,000 mg of calcium per day. This is about three servings of calcium-rich foods. Women 18 years and younger need 1,300 mg per day, or four servings of foods high in calcium. Many women do not get enough calcium, so it is important to focus on calcium-rich foods. Women who do not consume dairy products should consider a calcium supplement or a multivitamin.Dairy products like milk, yogurt, and cheese are good sources of calcium. Non-fat (skim) and low-fat (1%) dairy have equal amounts of calcium and fewer calories than higher fat (2% and whole) dairy.Other sources of calcium include dark green, leafy vegetables, dried beans and peas, nuts and seeds, and sardines. Calcium-fortified foods and beverages are also good sources of calcium. These include some orange juices, soy milk, tofu, almond milk, and breakfast cereals. It is easiest to meet your calcium needs through dairy foods. If you are vegan, have lactose intolerance, or a milk allergy, ask your health care provider how to consume enough calcium.Pregnant women should not consume raw (unpasteurized) milk or eat foods that contain raw milk. Raw milk can increase the risk of very dangerous foodborne illnesses, including listeriosis. For more information, see the Food Safety section of this resource.Vitamin DVitamin D is important for calcium absorption, immune function and brain health. Sunlight is one source of Vitamin D. About five to ten minutes of sunlight to exposed arms or the face can supply a days worth of Vitamin D. These times can vary depending on your geographical location and skin color. Aim for fifty mcg, or 2,000 IUs, of Vitamin D per day. This goal can be met with a multivitamin. Milk or yogurt with added Vitamin D can help you meet your daily needs. Oily fish, mushrooms, fortified cereals, and dietary supplements also contain vitamin D.IronIron carries oxygen through the blood and delivers it throughout the body. It also aids in immunity, brain development, and metabolism. About 90 percent of the iron in the body is recycled every day. The growing baby also stores enough iron to last through the first few months of life.Pregnant women have an increased amount of blood in their bodies so they need more iron than non-pregnant women. Pregnant women should aim for a total of 45 mg of iron per day from foods and dietary supplements. Animal products, including red meat, fish, poultry, and eggs, are rich in iron. Other options include enriched and whole grain breads, cereals, and pasta. Green leafy vegetables, beans, nuts, eggs, and dried fruits are also a good source.The type of iron found in animal products is different from the iron found in plant sources. The body does not absorb the iron in plant sources as well as the iron in meat, fish, and poultry. But iron absorption can increase when eaten with foods high in vitamin C (like orange juice or red bell peppers). A registered dietitian can recommend iron-rich foods and foods that can help with iron absorption.Many women enter pregnancy with low iron reserves. Your health care provider may recommend iron supplementation starting at the first prenatal visit. Some women may also need screening for iron deficiency on an ongoing basis. Take iron supplements between meals, with water or juice, and not with other supplements. Substances in coffee, tea, and milk can inhibit iron absorption. Taking iron supplements at bedtime may help reduce upset stomach and/or heartburn.Folic Acid/Folate/Vitamin B 9Folic acid, a B vitamin needed to help the baby grow, is key before and throughout pregnancy. Folic acid reduces the risk of spina bifida and other birth defects of the brain and spinal cord, which are also called neural tube defects (NTDs). Folate is the term for the different forms of the nutrient found naturally in foods. Folic acid is the form used in supplements and in enriched grain products.Enriched bread, flour, pasta, rice, cereals, and other grain products are common food sources of folic acid. To see if your food contains folic acid, check food labels to see if the food contains folic acid or folate.Any woman planning to become pregnant should consume 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily to help prevent birth defects. This is along with eating foods that contain folate. Women who have had a baby with NTD in the past should take 4 mg per day of folic acid before getting pregnant again.There are many ways to meet your folate/folic acid needs. First, take a multivitamin with folic acid. Also, be sure to eat lots of fruits and vegetables, enriched grain products, legumes (such as peanuts), citrus fruits and juices.Other Food IngredientsCaffeineCoffee, tea, energy drinks, some soft drinks, chocolate, and some over-the-counter medications contain caffeine. Pregnant or not, it is important to estimate your total caffeine intake from all sources. Caffeine from foods and beverages is able to cross the placenta and becomes part of breast milk. Yet, most research finds that pregnant and nursing mothers can consume moderate amounts of caffeine safely. Moderate caffeine intake during pregnancy is about 200 mg/day, which is equal to about two 8-ounce cups of coffee or four cups of tea a day. A 12-ounce caffeinated soft drink contains about 37 mg of caffeine, while an 8-ounce energy drink has about 100 mg. It is important to read the food labels on foods and beverages to be aware of how much caffeine they contain.Some women may have heard about a link between caffeine and miscarriage. There have been many studies on whether caffeine increases miscarriage risk. Yet the results are unclear. Leading health expertsagree that200 mg caffeine perday or less during pregnancy is safe. Talk to your health care provider about your caffeine intake if you have a history of heart problems or high blood pressure.Low-calorie sweeteners Low-calorie sweeteners are safe for the general public, including pregnant women. The FDA and other leading authorities affirm their safety. Eight low-calorie sweeteners allowed for use in foods and as tabletop sweeteners. They are acesulfame potassium (Ace-K), advantame, aspartame, neotame, saccharin, sucralose, monk fruit extract, and stevia leaf extract. Studies show that they are all safe to consume during pregnancy.Anyone with phenylketonuria (PKU) must restrict their intake of phenylalanine from all sources. This includes aspartame. PKU is a genetic disorder that prevents the breakdown of phenylalanine. Phenylanine is present in aspartame and many other foods. Pregnant women who have the PKU gene but not the PKU disorder can digest aspartame safely.SodiumSodium is a very important, natural part of fluids in the human body. Sodium works with other minerals to keep water balance in the body. It is also critical for a healthy nervous system and muscle coordination.Sodium needs and limits for pregnant women are not different from the general population. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend limiting sodium intake to 2,300 mg or less per day. Excessive sodium intake has been linked to high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke, and other health conditions.Other Nutrition SourcesVitamin/Mineral SupplementsA balanced diet meets most nutrient needs. Still, your health care provider may recommend you take a daily multivitamin as well. These can also be helpful if you plan to become pregnant. Taken a few months before conception, an over-the-counter prenatal vitamin may help resolve any nutritional deficiencies.More vitamin and/or mineral supplementation may be important for certain groups. For example, you may need to supplement your diet if you are a strict vegan or follow a restrictive diet. Additional supplementation may also be beneficial if you are carrying twins or triplets. Consider taking a calcium supplement (600 milligrams per day) plus Vitamin D if you are a vegan, are under 25, or do not consume dairy. Also, vitamin B12 supplements (and perhaps vitamin D and zinc) for strict vegans.Pregnant women should not take Vitamin A supplements. Excessive levels of Vitamin A could be toxic to the developing baby. You can meet your vitamin A needs with a healthful diet and a prenatal multivitamin.Herbal and Botanical SupplementsThere is no scientific evidence to support benefits from herbal and botanical products during pregnancy. In fact, some herbal products may have serious side effects for both mom and baby. For these reasons, pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid herbal and botanical supplements.Alcohol and PregnancyDrinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause permanent physical, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities. Do not consume alcohol during pregnancy. Also, women who are trying to get pregnant should not drink alcohol. Many women do not know they are pregnant until they are four to six weeks into the pregnancy. Drinking even small amounts during this time could expose their developing baby to alcohol. Women should stop drinking alcohol as soon as they find out they are pregnant.Weight Gain during PregnancyIt is important to track your weight gain during pregnancy. This helps to make sure that both you and your baby are healthy. Women who gain too little weight are at risk of having a small baby (less than 5 1/2 pounds). Yet women who gain too much weight have a greater risk of having the baby early or having a large baby. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also lead to other health problems. These may include gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and varicose veins in the mother.Pregnant women store fat to prepare for breastfeeding. If you are below your target pregnancy weight, your health care provider will carefully track your progress. Also, ask your health care provider or a registered dietitian to help with meal planning. This will help ensure that you get the nutrients and calories you need for proper weight gain.Goals for Weight GainWeight gain goals are based on pre-pregnancy weight, height, age, and usual eating patterns. Every woman and every pregnancy is unique. Your healthcare provider can help you gain weight at a healthy rate throughout pregnancy.A weight gain of 25 to 35 pounds is normal for women with a body mass index, or BMI, of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 (""normal weight""). BMI is one way to determine if you are at an appropriate weight. This tool can determine how much weight you should gain during pregnancy. Women who are below healthy weight when they conceive (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) should aim to gain about 28 to 40 pounds. Women with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 (""overweight"") should gain no more than 15 to 25 pounds. Go to http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/ to calculate your individual BMI.Women with a BMI over 30 kg/m2 (""obese"") should gain no more than 11 to 20 pounds. If you are in this category, a health care provider or registered dietitian can help you meet these recommendations in a healthy way. Aim to meet your calorie and nutrient needs, while maintaining regular physical activity. Weight loss during pregnancy is not advised.If you are carrying more than one baby, weight gain recommendations increase. Women with a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 should gain 37-54 pounds. Women with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 should gain 31-50 pounds. Women with a BMI over 30 kg/m2 should aim to gain 25-42 pounds. There are no set guidelines for weight gain for underweight (BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2) women carrying more than one baby. Work closely with your health care provider to ensure proper weight gain.Pattern of Weight GainPatterns of weight gain during pregnancy are as important as total weight gain. Your health care provider will keep records of your height and weight starting on the first prenatal visit. Regular weigh-ins will be recorded at each visit to make sure you are gaining weight at the proper rate.Weight maintenance or slight weight losses are normal during the first trimester (or first 13 weeks) of pregnancy. But most women should expect to gain about four to five pounds during the first trimester. Weight gain should come from the nutrient-rich foods described earlier in this resource. Listen to your bodys signals and stop eating when you feel full. This will help keep you from overeating because youre eating for two.Women with healthy pre-pregnancy weights should gain about one pound a week during the second and third trimesters. Women who are underweight before conception should gain a little more than one pound per week. Those who were initially overweight should gain at a slower rate (a little more than a half a pound per week).Food Cravings and AversionsFood cravings and dislikes of certain foods are common during pregnancy. There is no evidence that food cravings are linked to nutritional deficiencies. Their cause remains a mystery. It is acceptable to meet your food cravings within reason. Especially when they supply nutrients to the diet.In rare cases, some pregnant women crave nonfood substances. This is a disorder called pica. The consumption of nonfood items can be dangerous for both mother and baby. In some cases, pica involves eating large amounts of nonfood. This can prevent you from getting enough calories or nutrients to stay healthy. Examples of these nonfood items include clay, starch, ice, coffee grounds, or baking soda. If you experience nonfood cravings, talk to your health care provider right away. These symptoms may be a sign of nutrient deficiency (such as Iron), and may need to be treated with an additional supplement.Physical ActivityPhysical activity is another critical part of good health. Include 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity on most, if not all, days of the week. Try activities like walking or swimming. But avoid activities that have a high risk of falling or injury. If you already do vigorous activities (like running), you can continue them throughout your pregnancy. Discuss adjustments to the activity with your health care provider. Some women cannot fit 30 minutes of one time at one time into their schedules. Feel free to split up the time into three 10-minute intervals throughout the day.Being Smart About Food Safety Food safety is important for everyone. There are certain foods that pose an extra risk to pregnant women and their unborn babies. In particular, pregnant women should be aware of their increased risk of listeriosis.Listeriosis Listeriosis is a dangerous infection caused by bacteria often found in soil, ground water, and on plants. Refrigerated, ready-to-eat foods such as meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy may contain listeria. Also, unpasteurized (raw) milk and products made with raw milk may contain these bacteria. Listeria can be dangerous for pregnant women and their unborn babies. Listeriosis, the infection caused by listeria, can cause many dangers for mother and baby. These include premature delivery, miscarriage, fetal death, and severe illness of the newborn.Symptoms of listeriosis can take a few days or even weeks to appear and can be mild. You may not even know you have listeriosis. This makes practicing proper food safety even more critical. Listeriosis can have flu-like symptoms at first. These include sudden onset of fever, chills, muscle aches, diarrhea, and/or upset stomach. Other symptoms could include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions. A blood test can determine if you have listeriosis, and it can be treated with antibiotics. This can also prevent the fetus from contracting the infection.Avoid certain foods during pregnancy to prevent listeriosis. These include:Hot dogs, luncheon or deli meats, unless they are reheated until steaming hot.Soft cheeses such as feta, Brie, Camembert, and blue-veined cheeseSoft Mexican-style cheeses (queso blanco fresco). Unless they are labeled as made with pasteurized milk.Deli salads such as ham salad, chicken salad, egg salad, tuna salad, or seafood salad.Refrigerated meat-based pt or spreads.Refrigerated smoked seafood, unless it is an ingredient in a cooked dish such as a casserole.Raw (unpasteurized) milk or foods that contain unpasteurized milk.Mercury in FishFish contains high-quality protein and other essential nutrients. It is also low in saturated fat, and contains healthy omega-3 fats. These fats contribute to heart health, brain development and childrens proper growth and development. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines encourage pregnant and breastfeeding women to eat a 2-3 meals (8-12 ounces) of seafood each week.All popular types of fish in the U.S. are healthy, low in mercury and safe to eat during pregnancy. These include salmon, tuna (light canned), and tilapia. All seafood contains trace (very, very small) amounts of mercury. But only four types of fish should be avoided during pregnancy due to their mercury content. These higher-mercury fish are tilefish, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel.ConclusionFood has a big role in maintaining the health of both mothers and their babies. Practice good nutrition and food safety habits during pregnancy. These can have lifelong benefits for you and your child. Eat a mix of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, lean meats, and beans. All food groups provide essential nutrients to your diet. Also, remember that certain foods may pose health risks to the mother and unborn baby. Choose foods based on the principles of balance, variety, and moderation. This is the best approach to enjoying a healthy eating plan during pregnancy and for a lifetime.A Message from the American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA)PAs are licensed health professionals, and valued members of a health care team that includes a supervising physician.

",http://www.foodinsight.org/healthy-eating-pregnancy-nutrients-weight-gain-food-safety,"A healthy eating pattern is very important during pregnancy. Good nutrition plays a key role in the health of both mother and baby. As a mom-to-be, you have higher nutrient needs than you did before conception. Yet the general principles of good nutritionvariety, balance, and moderationstill apply during pregnancy.This resource will help you learn how to eat healthy during pregnancy. This includes how to choose a variety of healthy foods, maintain healthy weight gain during pregnancy, and stay food-safe.Click here to downloadA Balanced DietWhat a Mom-to-Be Needs Eating a balanced diet before, during, and after pregnancy is one part of good health. This section covers the key nutrients pregnant women need and where to find them.CaloriesCalorie (aka energy for the body) needs increase during pregnancy. But eating for two only requires an additional 340 calories during the second trimester and 500 calories in the third trimester. The first trimester does not require any extra calories.Choose foods and beverages that are nutrient-dense. This means that they good sources of the building blocks your body needs. Nutrient-dense foods are full of vitamins, minerals and other nutrients. Eat variety of foods from all five food groups. These include grains, vegetables, fruits, dairy, and meat and beans. This will ensure that you and your growing baby are getting the nutrients you both need.Your nutrient and calorie needs are higher if you are carrying more than one baby. Discuss what and how much to eat with your health care provider.Key NutrientsProteinProtein helps maintain muscle and body tissue. It is also key for a babys growth  especially during the second and third trimesters. Most pregnant women should take in about 70 grams of protein every day to meet their minimum needs. Keep in mind you may need more than that. Protein requirements vary based on weight and activity level. Talk to your health care provider if you have questions about your daily protein intake. Lean meats, poultry, fish, eggs, dairy products, and legumes (beans) are good sources of protein. These foods also supply iron, B vitamins, and other important nutrients. Dried beans, lentils, nuts, and soy products like tofu are other good sources of protein.If you are vegetarian, you can meet your protein needs by eating foods that are complete protein sources. A complete protein has all the essential building blocks (amino acids) your body needs. Each day, eat a variety of protein sources to provide your body with essential amino acids. Vegetarian protein options include beans, milk, yogurt, eggs, and soy products. Greek yogurt is another great option. It has twice the amount of protein when compared to regular yogurt. Pregnant vegans are able to meet their protein needs from soy, a complete protein source. Sources of soy protein include soy milk, soy cheese, soy yogurt, tofu, and tempeh. Examples of other protein-rich vegan foods are nuts and beans (red kidney beans, chickpeas, black beans, etc.).CarbohydratesCarbohydrates are the primary source of energy for the body. Fruits, vegetables, grains, and dairy products contain carbohydrates. Whole grains are an important source of nutrients, such as dietary fiber. They also provide a variety of health benefits. Other important carbohydrate foods include enriched refined grains. These grains have the added benefit of iron and folic acid, two essential nutrients for the babys development. Many carbohydrate foods are great choices for breakfast. Including English muffins, yogurt, bagels, cereals, breads, and fruits. Other carbohydrate-containing choices for meals or snacks include crackers, bread, and pasta.Aim to get the majority of your daily calories from carbohydrates. For most people, carbohydrates should make up about 45 to 65 percent of daily calorie intake. Most pregnant and breastfeeding women need about 175-210 grams of carbohydrates per day.FatsFat is key for good nutrition, health, and storage of many important vitamins. Like carbohydrates and protein, dietary fat is an important source of energy for the body. Certain foods that contain fat supply the body with essential fatty acids. Essential fatty acids are fats that the body does not make, so they should be included in the diet. Most importantly, essential fatty acids are critical for the babys growth and development.Health experts recommend keeping total fat intake between 20 and 35 percent of total calories. Most fats should come from unsaturated sources. Sources of unsaturated fat include fish, vegetable oils (canola, soybean, olive, peanut, safflower, and sunflower oils), nuts, and flaxseeds. All women, including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding should follow these recommendations.DHA is an unsaturated fat that is important for babies brain and eye development. Pregnant women should aim to get 200 mg of DHA per day. Oily fish such as salmon and tuna contain DHA. For example, a serving of salmon (3.5 ozor roughly the size of a deck of cards) has over 1g of DHA. This is five times the recommended amount. A health care provider may recommend a dietary supplement or prenatal vitamin with DHA. For more information on eating fish during pregnancy, see the Food Safety section.CalciumCalcium is important for the growth of strong bones and teeth. Calcium intake is necessary for all women. Especially pregnant women younger than 25 years old whose bones are still growing.Pregnant women should aim to consume 1,000 mg of calcium per day. This is about three servings of calcium-rich foods.

Calcium-fortified foods and beverages are also good sources of calcium. These include some orange juices, soy milk, tofu, almond milk, and breakfast cereals. It is easiest to meet your calcium needs through dairy foods. If you are vegan, have lactose intolerance, or a milk allergy, ask your health care provider how to consume enough calcium.Pregnant women should not consume raw (unpasteurized) milk or eat foods that contain raw milk. Raw milk can increase the risk of very dangerous foodborne illnesses, including listeriosis. For more information, see the Food Safety section of this resource.Vitamin DVitamin D is important for calcium absorption, immune function and brain health. Sunlight is one source of Vitamin D. About five to ten minutes of sunlight to exposed arms or the face can supply a days worth of Vitamin D. These times can vary depending on your geographical location and skin color. Aim for fifty mcg, or 2,000 IUs, of Vitamin D per day. This goal can be met with a multivitamin. Milk or yogurt with added Vitamin D can help you meet your daily needs.

You can meet your vitamin A needs with a healthful diet and a prenatal multivitamin.Herbal and Botanical SupplementsThere is no scientific evidence to support benefits from herbal and botanical products during pregnancy. In fact, some herbal products may have serious side effects for both mom and baby. For these reasons, pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid herbal and botanical supplements.Alcohol and PregnancyDrinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause permanent physical, behavioral, and intellectual disabilities. Do not consume alcohol during pregnancy. Also, women who are trying to get pregnant should not drink alcohol. Many women do not know they are pregnant until they are four to six weeks into the pregnancy. Drinking even small amounts during this time could expose their developing baby to alcohol. Women should stop drinking alcohol as soon as they find out they are pregnant.Weight Gain during PregnancyIt is important to track your weight gain during pregnancy. This helps to make sure that both you and your baby are healthy. Women who gain too little weight are at risk of having a small baby (less than 5 1/2 pounds). Yet women who gain too much weight have a greater risk of having the baby early or having a large baby. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may also lead to other health problems. These may include gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, and varicose veins in the mother.Pregnant women store fat to prepare for breastfeeding. If you are below your target pregnancy weight, your health care provider will carefully track your progress. Also, ask your health care provider or a registered dietitian to help with meal planning. This will help ensure that you get the nutrients and calories you need for proper weight gain.Goals for Weight GainWeight gain goals are based on pre-pregnancy weight, height, age, and usual eating patterns. Every woman and every pregnancy is unique. Your healthcare provider can help you gain weight at a healthy rate throughout pregnancy.A weight gain of 25 to 35 pounds is normal for women with a body mass index, or BMI, of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 (""normal weight""). BMI is one way to determine if you are at an appropriate weight. This tool can determine how much weight you should gain during pregnancy. Women who are below healthy weight when they conceive (BMI < 18.5 kg/m2) should aim to gain about 28 to 40 pounds. Women with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 (""overweight"") should gain no more than 15 to 25 pounds. Go to http://www.cdc.gov/nccdphp/dnpa/bmi/ to calculate your individual BMI.Women with a BMI over 30 kg/m2 (""obese"") should gain no more than 11 to 20 pounds. If you are in this category, a health care provider or registered dietitian can help you meet these recommendations in a healthy way. Aim to meet your calorie and nutrient needs, while maintaining regular physical activity. Weight loss during pregnancy is not advised.If you are carrying more than one baby, weight gain recommendations increase. Women with a BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 kg/m2 should gain 37-54 pounds. Women with a BMI of 25 to 29.9 kg/m2 should gain 31-50 pounds. Women with a BMI over 30 kg/m2 should aim to gain 25-42 pounds. There are no set guidelines for weight gain for underweight (BMI less than 18.5 kg/m2) women carrying more than one baby. Work closely with your health care provider to ensure proper weight gain.Pattern of Weight GainPatterns of weight gain during pregnancy are as important as total weight gain. Your health care provider will keep records of your height and weight starting on the first prenatal visit. Regular weigh-ins will be recorded at each visit to make sure you are gaining weight at the proper rate.Weight maintenance or slight weight losses are normal during the first trimester (or first 13 weeks) of pregnancy. But most women should expect to gain about four to five pounds during the first trimester. Weight gain should come from the nutrient-rich foods described earlier in this resource. Listen to your bodys signals and stop eating when you feel full. This will help keep you from overeating because youre eating for two.Women with healthy pre-pregnancy weights should gain about one pound a week during the second and third trimesters. Women who are underweight before conception should gain a little more than one pound per week. Those who were initially overweight should gain at a slower rate (a little more than a half a pound per week).Food Cravings and AversionsFood cravings and dislikes of certain foods are common during pregnancy. There is no evidence that food cravings are linked to nutritional deficiencies. Their cause remains a mystery. It is acceptable to meet your food cravings within reason. Especially when they supply nutrients to the diet.In rare cases, some pregnant women crave nonfood substances. This is a disorder called pica. The consumption of nonfood items can be dangerous for both mother and baby. In some cases, pica involves eating large amounts of nonfood. This can prevent you from getting enough calories or nutrients to stay healthy. Examples of these nonfood items include clay, starch, ice, coffee grounds, or baking soda. If you experience nonfood cravings, talk to your health care provider right away. These symptoms may be a sign of nutrient deficiency (such as Iron), and may need to be treated with an additional supplement.Physical ActivityPhysical activity is another critical part of good health. Include 30 minutes or more of moderate physical activity on most, if not all, days of the week. Try activities like walking or swimming. But avoid activities that have a high risk of falling or injury. If you already do vigorous activities (like running), you can continue them throughout your pregnancy. Discuss adjustments to the activity with your health care provider. Some women cannot fit 30 minutes of one time at one time into their schedules. Feel free to split up the time into three 10-minute intervals throughout the day.Being Smart About Food Safety Food safety is important for everyone. There are certain foods that pose an extra risk to pregnant women and their unborn babies. In particular, pregnant women should be aware of their increased risk of listeriosis.Listeriosis Listeriosis is a dangerous infection caused by bacteria often found in soil, ground water, and on plants. Refrigerated, ready-to-eat foods such as meat, poultry, seafood, and dairy may contain listeria. Also, unpasteurized (raw) milk and products made with raw milk may contain these bacteria. Listeria can be dangerous for pregnant women and their unborn babies. Listeriosis, the infection caused by listeria, can cause many dangers for mother and baby. These include premature delivery, miscarriage, fetal death, and severe illness of the newborn.Symptoms of listeriosis can take a few days or even weeks to appear and can be mild. You may not even know you have listeriosis. This makes practicing proper food safety even more critical. Listeriosis can have flu-like symptoms at first. These include sudden onset of fever, chills, muscle aches, diarrhea, and/or upset stomach. Other symptoms could include headache, stiff neck, confusion, loss of balance, or convulsions. A blood test can determine if you have listeriosis, and it can be treated with antibiotics. This can also prevent the fetus from contracting the infection.Avoid certain foods during pregnancy to prevent listeriosis. These include:Hot dogs, luncheon or deli meats, unless they are reheated until steaming hot.Soft cheeses such as feta, Brie, Camembert, and blue-veined cheeseSoft Mexican-style cheeses (queso blanco fresco). Unless they are labeled as made with pasteurized milk.Deli salads such as ham salad, chicken salad, egg salad, tuna salad, or seafood salad.Refrigerated meat-based pt or spreads.Refrigerated smoked seafood, unless it is an ingredient in a cooked dish such as a casserole.Raw (unpasteurized) milk or foods that contain unpasteurized milk.Mercury in FishFish contains high-quality protein and other essential nutrients. It is also low in saturated fat, and contains healthy omega-3 fats. These fats contribute to heart health, brain development and childrens proper growth and development. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines encourage pregnant and breastfeeding women to eat a 2-3 meals (8-12 ounces) of seafood each week.All popular types of fish in the U.S. are healthy, low in mercury and safe to eat during pregnancy. These include salmon, tuna (light canned), and tilapia. All seafood contains trace (very, very small) amounts of mercury. But only four types of fish should be avoided during pregnancy due to their mercury content. These higher-mercury fish are tilefish, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel.ConclusionFood has a big role in maintaining the health of both mothers and their babies. Practice good nutrition and food safety habits during pregnancy. These can have lifelong benefits for you and your child. Eat a mix of whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy, lean meats, and beans. All food groups provide essential nutrients to your diet. Also, remember that certain foods may pose health risks to the mother and unborn baby. Choose foods based on the principles of balance, variety, and moderation. This is the best approach to enjoying a healthy eating plan during pregnancy and for a lifetime.A Message from the American Academy of Physician Assistants (AAPA)PAs are licensed health professionals, and valued members of a health care team that includes a supervising physician.
