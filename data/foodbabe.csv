Your Top Pregnancy Questions Answered!,http://foodbabe.com/2017/03/14/top-pregnancy-questions-answered/,"I have been slowly cataloging all the pregnancy questions I received while pregnantwhat prenatal vitamins I took whether Im vaccinating my baby what foods I avoided how did I prevent stretch marksdid I do a birth plan? I answer all these questions (and more!) This list will be updated regularly so if you have more questions, please ask in the comments below and Ill update this list and let you know!My sweet Harley at one week oldPhotography by Little Nest PortraitsWhat preparation did you go through before getting pregnant?Ihave been on a journey for over 10 years to get my health back on track, which helped to prepare my body for pregnancy. Over the years, acupuncture has helped tremendously to balance my hormones and heal my body. I also stopped taking birth control pills years ago, because they were preventing my body from doingwhat it is naturally supposed to do. Ive restored my gut bacteria back to normal with a whole foods diet, supplementing with effective probiotics, and eating fermented food daily.My bookThe Food Babe Waywill show you how to provide thecleanest foods for your body to prepare it for pregnancy  it includes a 21 day plan that includes all the healthy habits I follow. Another great book that I love and read (twice!) was How to Conceive Naturally: And Have a Healthy Pregnancy after 30 by Christa Orecchio, a member of my advisory council. This book is spot on about the nutrition you want to put into your body if you are tryingto conceive.What foods did you avoidwhile pregnant?Overall, I stuck with the same diet that I had before pregnancy full of whole nutrient-rich foodswith a few indulgences into those cravings  organic grilled cheeses and pizza to be exact!However, thereare a few foods that I didnt eat during pregnancySushi  especially Tuna (and other high-mercury fish): You are supposed to limit it due to mercury content, so its not worth the risk. Although I ate fish during pregnancy, I stuckto lower mercury varieties of fish such as wild salmon. Other high-mercury fish to avoid are halibut, sea bass, swordfish, shark, marlin, orange roughy, and mackerel.Processed foods: Anything that comes in a package or box or container, Iate way less of! I wanted to stay awayfrom all the packaging chemicals that food can be exposed to when it is processed  stuff you do not see on the label. Also once a food is processed, nutrients are degraded  I wanted to the get the maximum micro-nutrition out of all my food to make sure there are plenty of nutrients the baby could assimilate.Soda and sugary drinks: Sugar in general is bad, but it goes down way too easy when you drink it!MSG, yeast extract, hydrolyzed proteins, natural and artificial flavors:In the second trimester, your baby can actually start to taste the food you are eating! Knowing that gave meserious motivation to stay away from controversial food additives and processed foods that screw with your sense of taste or satisfaction. You dont want them tricked by the food industry before theyre even born!Processed and cured meats like sausage, ham, and deli: These are more likely than other foods to be contaminated with listeria, which can cause a miscarriage or infect your baby.Did you drinkraw juice while pregnant?Yes, smoothies and juices made with mostly vegetables are full of vitamins and minerals that help to keep your immune system strong during pregnancy. As always, I take care to thoroughly wash my vegetables before making a juice and fill up my blender or juicer with greens like romaine lettuce, spinach, turnip greens, mustard greens, parsley, and collard greens. I tried not to overdo the beet juice though! I did that once in my first trimester and lets just say it did not stay down! Its always good to remember natural foods when juiced can be very potent too.What did you doabout cravings for bad food?Ive never had such a roller coaster of cravings before in my life (I know you other pregnant women can relate!). Read more about that here. One of myobsessions was frozen grapes to curb that sudden sweet tooth. I tookmy commitment to staying on track with my eating principles even more seriously while pregnant, even while indulging in the occasional treat. Id indulge  but I made sure the ingredients wereorganic. If I wanted cookies  Id eat them, but they need to be organic first to avoid any unnecessary toxic pesticides and chemical additives!What strict pregnancy guidelines did you adhere to? Did you eat soft cheese? Have a glass of wine? Etc.I didnt drink any alcohol, but did have some soft cheeses on occasion when I knew they were either heated or pasteurized. I continued my habit of drinking lemon water with cayenne pepper first thing in the morning, drank kombucha on occasion, reduced the amount of caffeine I used to have in half (from 8 ounces of coffee or tea to 4 ounces), and tried to eat fermented foods everyday (See more important info on pregnancy habits from my advisory council member Dr. Amy Shah here).Can you give us a breakdown of what you ate on a daily basis while being pregnant? What are some things that are completely off limits aside from the obvious foods?As always, my diet consists mostly of plants like fruits, vegetables, seeds, beans and nuts, but there are some specific foods that I ate more of during pregnancy. This is such a big topic that I wrote an entire post about it with links to my favorite recipes! Check it out here.Did you drinkthat awful glucose drink to test for gestational diabetes?These drinks (also known as Glucola) are essentially sugar water with hazardous artificial colors and preservatives fora VERY LONG shelf life. They are no better than most sodas on the market  and truly not something youd want to consume while pregnant. While its certainly important to monitor your blood glucose during pregnancy, there are saferalternatives to drinking this toxic sugar water. I simply asked my doctor what my options were and she was ready with 5 alternatives! I wasable to monitor with simple blood tests and it wasreassuring to see that my blood sugarwas on track.Specifically, I took my blood sugar two times a day for 3 days over one week and reported the results back to her.Be sure to ask your health care provider for options! In myopinion there is no way in hell any doctor could convince me to drink something with flame retardant, artificial dyes made from petroleum, controversial preservatives and GMOs, pregnant or not!Did you wear nail polish while pregnant?Only on my toes since it lasted longer and I didnt need to paint them as often. I am generally doing the same thing while breastfeeding and handling my newborn as well  although I do occasionally paint them for events andhere is a link to some safer nail polish brands Ive used.How did you handle being around a computer and wireless phone all the time?One of the things that I absolutely could not live without during pregnancy was my Belly Armor Belly Blanket. I worked from my laptop almost every day, but knew that it wasnt safe to expose my baby to all of the radiation that emits from laptops and wifi. Radiation exposures during pregnancy can increase risk of miscarriage and are also linked to developmental issues  and there was no way I was willing to take that risk. So I found an amazing solution! I just placed this Belly Blanket over my pregnant belly whenever I was working at my computer or using my phone for an extended period of time. The blanket is made with special fabric that neutralizes electromagnetic waves and blocks the radiation from reaching my belly, keeping my baby safe. This really gave me peace of mind! Now that she is born, I continue to use my Belly Blanket to protect her while Im on my computer. As a new partner of Food Babe, Belly Armor is offering you a special deal:Get a free baby hat ($19 value) if you spend $50 or more in their online store with the code foodbabe at checkout. (Note: the code will only work once you have the baby hat in your cart! These are found in their Nursery section.)How did you handle the exhaustion?Before getting pregnant, I couldnt remember the last nap I took! But once I became pregnant, I needed at least a 30 min  1 hour nap almost every day, otherwise I would fall asleep at 8pm. Your body needs more sleep during pregnancy, so dont fight it.I also drankunsweetened iced tea or kombucha to perk myself up on occasion!What do you recommend for prenatal supplements and vitamins?I didnttakeprenatal supplement formulas because the ones available on the market are one-size-fits-all and not everything in those supplementswork well with my body. I worked with my doctor to come up with a supplement regimen that worked for me. I tooka whole food based organic multivitamin with no fillers and synthetics, following theseguidelines.I also tookextra probiotics, calcium, vitamin D, magnesium which helps with sleep. Of course, I also eatThe Food Babe Wayand have been limiting the amount of sugar in my diet.What did you do to helpyou sleep?I wasable to sleep pretty well throughout my pregnancy, which Im thankful for. The vitamin and mineral supplements that I took(see above)werehelpful, but I also tooknightly baths with epsom salts. This really helpedme to relax and ease discomfort! I did not buy any special pillows, I just used a king size pillow between my legs while I slept on my side.How did you handle heartburn naturally?This simple remedy worked wonders for me: 1 tsp apple cider vinegar with 8 ounces of water. Take up to 2 doses, as needed. I also slept at an angle propped up on two pillows and took a 10 min walk after eating to help prevent heartburn.What did you do for exercise?Getting out in the fresh air makes a huge difference in everyday life! Although I didnt goat it as hard as I did before I was pregnant, just doing a little bit of something improved my mood. I keptit part of my routine and made sure to get up and go showing up to my exercise class every day, whether I coulddo everything or not! For example, I took a pilates barre class (Hilliard Studio Method) all the way up to my due date. I loved spinning in my first and second trimesters. And I lifted heavy weights with my trainer and took long walks the entire pregnancy.What did you do for your nausea?I drank ginger tea, woke up and ate first thing in the morning and had smaller meals spaced out through the day. Exercise always helped too!What did you doto prevent stretch marks?I found the most effective thing to do to avoid stretch marks is eat lots of fruits and vegetables and avoid processed foods while your tummy is growing. All those vitamins and minerals strengthen the skins elasticity! I also used organic coconut oil and/or sesame oil on my body every day.Did you take the flu shot during pregnancy?Idont normally take the flu shot because it has shown to be not effective (so I dont take the risk) and I would personally never consider it as a pregnant woman. Iwant mybody to react naturally to the environment and to fight viruses on its own. I take steps to prevent the flu  wash hands often, reduce stress, exercise, drink lots of filtered water, eat fermented foods, and avoid industrial toxins. I believe that livinga healthy lifestyle sets you up for a healthy pregnancy.Did you have anatural birth?Yes, you can read my birth story here.Did youencapsulate your placenta?No, I did not. I discussed this with my doctor and doula, researched options and there was not enough convincing evidence for me, although I have heard it does benefit some women.Did you do something for your baby shower registry to specify no plastics? If so, how did you make those requests known?The awesome women throwing me the shower put my preferences on the invitation. I had an eco baby shower, for example, instead of bringing a card with a gift, they requested guests bring an inscribed book instead. I also registered for a lot of eco-friendly items at Sprout San Francisco.What was your Birth Plan?My birth plan is below, this is highly personalized and you should talk about these choices with your family and health care providers before determining your own.This list is intended to express our preferences under normal conditions.Labor Preferences: A Natural Birth. I will use natural pain relief techniques. Please do not offer any medication, I will ask if needed. I have an adverse reaction to most pharmaceuticals. Interventions only following opportunity to discuss options with husband and doula. I prefer minimal internal exams. A vaginal exam only when I ask to be checked. I prefer to move freely during labor and eat and drink as needed.  I prefer only intermittent monitoring when needed. I prefer to have no IV but will consent to a saline lock, if medically necessary. I prefer no induction of any kind. I prefer the bag of waters to break on its own. I would like perineal support with massage, hot compresses and various positions to avoid a tear.  I prefer no episiotomy unless required for babys safety. I prefer that no vacuum or forceps are used.Birth Preferences: Please place baby on my bare chest immediately.  Please do not cut cord for 15 minutes or until it stops pulsing. Father will plan on cutting cord. Please allow placenta to expel on its own.Newborn Preferences: Please conduct newborn procedures in arms, at least 2 hours after birth.  We have chosen to DECLINE: erythomycin, Hep B vaccine (baby will follow up with Pediatrician), and Vitamin K shot (baby will be taking liquid Vitamin K per Stanford University Protocol). We consent to: newborn screening (including PKU), necessary emergency treatment. Please conduct all in room. Father will accompany baby for hearing test.Afterbirth Preferences:  Baby will be breastfed exclusively. Please do not offer sugar water or formula.  I wish for baby to remain with me following birth. Father will accompany baby out of room if needed. I do not wish to receive any medication post labor, including stool softener.  I prefer to leave the hospital as soon as possible after birth. Should a transfer be necessary for baby, please allow me to accompany baby.In case a Cesarean becomes necessary: Husband and doula present in operating room. Father holds baby immediately for skin-to-skin and stays with baby continually. Doula present continually during recovery. Newborn reunited with mother as soon as possible.Did you take any classes?Yes! I did the Mama Natural Birth Course from start to finish and loved it so much. This is a digital course that you watch from home on your own time, and on your own schedule. It is super informative and I left each lesson feeling empowered and confident. I can honestly say that I dont believe Ive ever enjoyed an online course as much as this one. You can sign up here for free and Mama Natural will send you weekly pregnancy updatesand you can find information on the Mama Natural Birth Course here.Are you going to vaccinate your child?Themost powerful thing you can do for your health is become educated about everythingyou put in your own and your familys bodies  whether it be the food you eat or the pharmaceuticals you inject. Vaccines are not one-size-fits-all and I feel that is way too simplistic of a view  and my doctor agrees. Not all vaccines are created equal. It is really important to recognize that what can help one person, has the ability to hurt another. Eachvaccine needs to be evaluated individually for its benefits and risks relative to your personal situation.Understand that Im not an expert on vaccines recommended by the CDC for children, but now that Im a parentI feel that it is my obligation to become as educated as possible on the subject so Ive been doing A LOT of reading! I have checked out or ordered just about every vaccine advice book under the sun and am doing a thorough personal investigation to become as educated as possible about my choices. I have also been taking the time to talk to my own doctors and trusted advisors to make the best decisions. I encourage you to do the same and make thedecision for yourself as to what you feel comfortable with. Here is one of my favorite books I read about the topic.What type of meal plans can I follow to help get me ready to become pregnant or while pregnant?Join us inthe Food Babe Eating Guide Program.

The Importance Of Gut Bacteria In Pregnancy (and how we destroy it with modern practices!),http://foodbabe.com/2017/03/14/importance-gut-bacteria-pregnancy-destroy-modern-practices/,"This is a guest post written by Dr. Amy Shah, a member of my Advisory Council. Dr. Shah is a practicing physician, specializing in Allergy & Immunology and Internal Medicine. Dr. Shah is also a mom, and as we were recently discussing my pregnancy she brought up a topic that I believe will be very helpful to all of the other mamas-to-be out there! How can you nurturethe bacteria in your gut to protect the future health of your child?{Photo credit: Brad Olson photography}Nurturing bacteria in pregnancy and childbirth may be the key to unlocking the mystery behind the modern American crisis of diabetes, autoimmunity, asthma, allergies, obesity and more!Here is how we in medicine think this happensThere are 2 basic arms of the immune system: Th1 and Th2. These are white blood cells known as T-helpers that recognize and combat pathogens. Th1 fights bacteria, and viruses; Th2 takes on parasites, allergies and, we think, does not have much of a role these days.During pregnancy the body is weighted towards Th2. The hypothesis is that is so the body does not activate the immune system against the growing fetus. When the baby is born it is also predominantly Th2. Because of the lack of bacteria (good and bad) and viruses in the modern world, the baby stays weighted towards the Th2 immune side instead of shifting back to Th1 side. This, we think, is why we have seen such an increase allergy, asthma and autoimmune disease!So what is the take away?Improve your babys life (and yours) by nurturing the bacteria around you. Our bacteria stand as an army blocking or helping things pass through into the body.I know its hard to believe, but there is more bacteria in our body than our cells! Heres what you can do to grow your gut garden:1. Avoid hand sanitizers and cleaning products when pregnant!I cant tell you how many times I see new moms slather hand sanitizer over themselves and anyone who comes close to their little one. The logic is there  of course you dont want pathogens near your sensitive newborn. But  AND A BIG BUT  is this sterilization may be doing more harm than good by blocking the colonization of nurturing bacteria.More concerning  ingredients in hand sanitizers are known endocrine disruptors that adversely affect sex hormones, especially in infants and new mothers. Endocrine disruptors are also found abundantly in common triclosan-based cleaning products. Use natural cleaning products when possible (or have someone else clean!)Tip: Dont let sick people go near your newborn but for others gentle washing with natural soap and water is preferred.2. Avoid C-sections when possible.Of course this isnt always possible and a C-section is necessary, but if it can be avoided, it should be. Immense difference has been reported in the microbiological constitution of babies born vaginally vs. C-section babies. C-section babies dont get microbes from the birth canal, which are different than those colonized by the skin, nipple and milk.A diverse microbiome is significant, as a less diverse microbiome means more chance the immune system will stay in the TH2  meaning a higher probability of asthma, allergies and obesity related immune disease later in life.Tip: If C-section is absolutely medically necessary, dont fret  skin to skin contact, breast feeding, and other techniques to improve babys microbiome exist.3. Avoid antibiotics  and that includes the food you eat!Again, of course, sometimes antibiotics are necessary and cant be avoided but we may be overly reliant on them as a panacea for every ill. Generally avoid antibiotics for gut health, but especially for your infant and when pregnant or breastfeeding. They wreak havoc on the gut garden, destroying good bacteria with the bad, decreasing bacterial diversity and even creating a leaky gut and mood disorders.Foods containing antibiotics can be assumed to have the same effect. Avoid conventional meats and dairy and instead look for products labeled organic  federally regulated to only come from animals never given antibiotics.4. Play with dirt and animals.You may have heard of the so-called Hygiene Hypothesis that speculates children raised in overly sterile, germ-free environments develop hypersensitive immune systems. Though it may sound counter-intuitive (and gross), exposing infants in their first year of development to pets, household germs, microbes found in soil, rodent dander and roach allergens appears to lay foundations for a robust immune system, lowering risk of asthma and allergies, according to research from Johns Hopkins.However, after the first year, the protective effects of exposure to dander, germs and droppings disappear. Playing in the dirt, on the other hand, seems to improve gut health no matter what age you are, so dont be afraid to be a little dirty!5. Breastfeed instead of formula feeding.Dont be too quick to wean off breast milk and introduce formula or solid food. Colonization and proliferation of an infants microbiota can be distressed when exclusive human-milk feeding is stopped. Formula especially incorporated into the diet while breastfeeding can undesirably alter the structure of babys gut.6. Practice Kangaroo Mother Care.Skin to skin contact, especially right after birth (even for preemies), exposes the newborn to the mothers bacteria, creating a more diverse gut garden.Kangaroo Mother Care  basically oodles of naked baby skin on skin exposure several hours a day  has a myriad of additional benefits for babys overall health. For example, breastfeeding maybe easier as it aids baby to seek out and latch on to moms nipple, reducing soreness.Studies suggest that babies deprived of skin contact can contribute to mood issues like depression and learning disabilities later in life.7. Your diet is KING for yourself and your baby.Obviously diet is top on the list of effectors to the intestinal microbiome. Sugar and processed, chemicalized, artificial foods dont just upset gut equilibrium but can lead to leaky gut, IBS and other digestive issues you dont want.Best course of action for a diet to improvegut health:Eat an organic whole food diet rich in nutrient dense foods like vegetables, fruits, and healthy fats.Steer clear of GMOs, artificial sweeteners, ibuprofen/NSAIDs, preservatives like TBHQ, etc.Eat and drink an abundance of superfoods like algae, seaweed, aloe vera, and cacao.Get plenty of probiotics and fermented foods like kefir and sauerkraut as well as prebiotics like tubers and alliums.The healthier your gut flora while pregnant and breastfeeding, the healthier your babys constitution  establishing their health now and for the rest of their life.Dr. Amy Shah is a specialist in Allergy & Immunology and Internal Medicine.

"How To Create The Safest, Organic and Natural Nursery For Your Child",http://foodbabe.com/2017/02/16/create-safest-organic-natural-nursery-child/,"When I first became pregnant, I knew right away I wanted to create a safe environment and nursery for my baby. There was so much to research and it all was very overwhelming. Cribs, mattresses, clothes, diapers, toys, strollers, car seats  the list goes on and on and on! I remember walking into Buy Buy Baby for the first time and walking right back out because it was too much to handle! But all my frustration quickly went away after I met the founder of Sprout San Francisco, a natural and organic childrens store in CA. Suzanne Price is a mother of two who has devoted her life researching toxic chemicals in childrens products and their effects on their bodies. When we met while I was on a business trip last year, we instantly hit it off. Her passion was contagious! Suzanne created Sprout to be a one-stop-shop for new parentswho want to outfittheir nursery with the safest and healthiest products. Sprout has done all the research for usand only stocks their store with products that get their seal of approval. I loved how Icould walk in to their store and feel comfortableas a new mom who wants to do the very best for my baby, knowing that everythingon the shelves is non-toxic and safe for my newborn.Shopping at Sprout was SO FUN! I didnt have to stress out researching every little thing myself! The staff made it so simple tooutfit my entire nursery and set up ababy registry formy friends and family.Iwas so impressed with everything they did for me and Harley, that I asked Suzanne to share her top tips and recommendations for a safe, natural and organic nursery in this special guest post.Also, to help all the other moms and dads out there, I partnered with Sprout to offer a 15% discount on your purchase when you use the code FOODBABE at checkout here.These pictures were taken by Little Nest Portraits(highly recommend them!)during Harleys one week old photo shoot.Still working on commissioning some low VOC art and picture frames for the walls, but Harleys nursery is almost done!Sprouts Baby Nursery Buying Guide:At Sprout, we try to provide everything a family needs for a new baby in the healthiest and most natural way possible. We offer a gift registry so people can let their friends know what to buy them, an app to register on their iPhone, and a registry checklist so that parents can make sure they have not forgotten anything they might need. We even provide Healthy Baby Guides on our website that help parents to learn everything they should be looking out for in every category. However, I sometimes forget how overwhelming this can be to parents who are learning about all of it at once for the first time. I decided to break down the main things you need to make sure you have in order to bring your baby home, and what Sprout looks for in each category to make sure it is as healthy for your baby as possible.Crib and Dresser / Changing Table: Try to find solid wood with low VOC paint. Most cheap cribs are made with particle board thats stuck together using glue that emits formaldehyde, a known carcinogen. Vanis Skylar Crib is made in the USA using solid hardwoods (pictured above). Youll also want a bookshelf to store all the adorable books and picture frames youll receive as gifts, as well as a comfortable place to change the baby, such as the top of a dresser with a secured organic changing pad.Crib Mattress: This is the most important thing to buy organic. Traditional mattresses are made of foam that release particulars into the air (VOCs) that are not good for your babys lungs. They are also sprayed with flame retardant chemicals, horrible for a baby to breath and known to cause lots of different health issues. Putting an organic mattress pad cover on a regular mattress does NOT solve the problem. But you should also have an organic mattress pad cover. Sprout sells a variety of organic mattresses. Vani chose Naturepedic (pictured above) and a fullyorganic co-sleeper here.Crib Bedding: Since your baby will spend so much time lying on these sheets, it is important to have organic crib sheets. Consider trying a solid white sheet with a patterned crib skirt to add some decoration to the crib if you do not fall in love with any of the organic patterned sheets.Clothing: You are going to get tons of clothing as gifts, and from everywhere, but you should definitely register for things you like. At the very newborn stage, its nice to have organic cotton touching your babys skin since it has been shown that pesticides can rub off of a finished garment. (Cotton is the most heavily pesticided crop in the country.) I would suggest registering for some layette sets like kimono tops (so they dont have to be pulled over the head) and pants in organic cotton and let people buy you all the other cute fun outfits for the older sizes. The first few weeks the baby will basically be in a shirt or bodysuit and a swaddle all the time anyway.Baby Carrier: Our favorite carriers are the adjustable, backpack-style Beco or the wrap-style Solly. Whichever you choose, prioritize organic, since its shocking how much the babies suck on the fabric and straps.Baby Bath: Make absolutely sure that it is free of BPA, PVC, andphthalates. These are 3 terrible chemicals in plastics that will leach into warm water.Car Seat: Many car seats are sprayed with toxic flame retardant chemicals. Find one that is GREENGUARD or OEKO-TEX certified, or that promises it does not use any of the worst flame retardants, like Tris. The only infant seat we carry is one we have had tested and know to be free of Tris, the Nuna Pipa.Toys: I always opt for wood or organic cotton over plastic. Phthalates in plastics were outlawed in toys for kids under 3 in 2009, yet nobody really knows this (so dont take hand-me-downs) and from what I have heard, it is not really enforced, especially for products made overseas.Glider / Rocker: A glider or rocker isnt an absolute must-have, but many find it extremely helpful in those early days of nursing your baby in the middle of the night. Make sure to look for one that does not have foam sprayed with flame retardant chemicals. Our exclusive gliders do not have flame retardants or polyurethane foam. Vani has our Como Pure in her nursery (pictured above).Rug: Many rugs are backed with formaldehyde emitting glue. Find a rug for your nursery made of natural fibers with no glue backing, so that your baby will be safe laying on it during tummy time.Art: To finish off your nursery, add some cute artwork to walls to give the room a personal touch. Just make sure that anything with paint is low VOC. Vani used Natura by Benjamin Moore.I think this is a good place to start and not get overwhelmed. Of course you can always call or come into one of our stores to ask as many questions you like of our knowledgeable sales team.Good luck!If you want to pick up any of these babyessentials or other amazing safe baby products, feel free to use the discount codeFOODBABE when you visit Sprout herefor 15% off.Iknowwhen you are expecting you have so many things to think about, so I hope this helps you out as much as it did me!

My Birth Story. Our Little Angel Is Here!,http://foodbabe.com/2017/01/24/birth-story-little-angel/,"Our little angel is here and we are so crazy in love. Meet Harley Diane, 6.5 pounds and 20 inches. Every time I look at her, myheart feels like it is going to explode! This is my birth storyI prepared right from the start for a natural child birthWhen I became pregnant back in April 2016, I knew right away I wanted to have a natural birth and my commitment became even stronger after talking to several experts, reading many books about child birth, taking a natural birth course and talking to my doctor & doula about the risks associated with some interventions and drugs. Hearing all my friends and familys birth stories, as well as reading and watching many online, there was one big common theme  there are no two births that are the same and things dont always go as planned! So I decided to go into all of this with a very easy going attitude and not get too worked up if things did not turn out the way I expected them to go. I said to myself whatever happens, happens, as long as I have a healthy baby at the end, nothing else matters. And I also repeated the mantra My body was designed to do this to prime my brain to stay focused on the goal.One of the biggestreasons I wanted a natural birth was because I know how my body reacts to foreign substances and pharmaceutical drugs  I dont feel good after taking them and often feel the bad side effects for weeks. Not only did I not want those substances to get to my newborn baby, but I wanted to have the fastest recovery possible after birth. I also have undergone two different abdominal surgeries in my lifetime and know the recovery is not for the faint of heart. These experiences have given me a very strong conviction to do what I can in my power to avoid medical interventions. Feeling the way I do now  a week later  I know I made the right decision for me to focus on a natural birth. I remain in awe that everything worked out the way I envisioned it to.I thought I would deliver early but no!The month leading up to the birth, I started to get Braxton Hicks contractions and at first they didnt hurt at all, and then suddenly on Christmas Eve (38 weeks) they began to hurt. The entire day on Christmas Eve, I was having contractions and even contracting at my brothers Christmas Eve party that evening. It was nothing too painful at this point, but I for sure thought I would have a Christmas baby (and my family thought so too!). A doctor friend at the party even wanted me to go to the hospital to get checked but I didnt go and eventually on Christmas Day all the contractions fizzled out.When you hit your due date everyone in the world starts calling and texting you, wondering when you are going to give birth. This can be stressful if you let it but after she didnt come early during the holiday break, I became super patient leading up to her birthday. Babies are born on their birthdays is one of my affirmation cards that I read every night and this kept me focused on taking care of myself, staying calm and relaxed before birth, knowing that my baby would arrive when she was ready. The extra week, gave me time to continue organizing closets and cabinets throughout the house  which I am so glad to have done now!The week leading up to the birthI have been using acupuncture for years as preventative medicine, but when I became pregnant, I started to go to acupuncture almost every week. Not only did this help my pregnancy symptoms (just ask my best friend, who said I never complained during my pregnancy!) but it primed my body for the best birth possible. When I hit 39.5 weeks, I had 3 acupuncture treatments over the course of one week to get my body ready for big day. Acupuncture can help start labor if your baby is ready! After these treatments, I started a type of early labor on Tuesday and Wednesday both nights I woke up at around 3am with painful contractions that hit every 20 mins or so but would tinker on and off throughout the day.The daybefore birthOn Thursday, the day before 41 weeks, I saw my doctor and we did a quick safety ultrasound check just to make sure I still had enough amniotic fluid and to see if the baby was doing well in there. As long as everything looked good, she was going to just let me keep going in my late pregnancy until the baby was ready. This was very exciting  I hadnt seen my baby for over 24 weeks! Everything turned out perfectly! She also checked my cervix and reported that I was 3 cm dilated and 75% effaced, all that early labor was working! This put me at so much ease and I was relaxed enough to go to the Bechtler Museum of Modern Art that afternoon (even though I was still contracting!) to walk around and keep my body moving. We bought the baby an art book to remember the moment and eventually my contractions fizzled out again to relax a bit for dinner.41 weeks pregnant! Last belly shot before the hospitalThe big dayAfter 2 nights of no sleep, I finally went into REAL labor late Thursday night  actually at about 2:30am Friday morning. The contractions hadsped up significantly to every8-10 minutes all night long. At about 5:30am I texted my doula and she wanted me to keep her posted on progress and we kept in touch throughout the morning. I labored at home finding any position to get me through  hands and knees and bending over with my arms on a wall were the best positions. At around noon, I knew it was time for my doula to come over, it was getting intense and I was having contractions every 5 minutes.What contractions feel likeFor those of youwho have never given birth or experienced contractions, it feels likethe worst stomach cramp you have ever experienced, and like a wave of sensation with a strong peak that you absolutely have to breathe to get through if you want to be able to handle the pain. It takes all of your focus and concentration during the contraction just toget to the next one. The key is to relax in between the contractions as much as possible so you can get through the next one.Is it time to go to the hospital yet?I had been in my bedroom all morning by the timemy doula arrived. She got me up out of bed and said take me on a tour of your house and so we went through and walked my entire house  going up and down the stairs in my house, I contracted on each wall! I had to hold on to her or the wall and bend down for every contraction. After the tour, I thought it would be a good time toeat something, my doula suggested soup and my husband warmed me up some butternut squash soup I had made for our freezer meals after the baby was born. I ate that with some crackers and water. It was so good! I was starving! Then it was finally time for the tub. This was my doulaslast resort before getting to the hospital, getting from the stage of early labor to active labor so I would not be in the hospital for too long before giving birth.According to many natural birth experts, if you get to the hospital too early, there is more time for interventions, so the key is to get there at just the right time to avoid that. My doula was very experienced in knowing when to go and without her, I probably would have left earlier my husband was definitely getting antsy and a bit nervous at this point!I had a ginger blackberry popsicle in the bath  it was delicious, but I couldnt finish it  the contractions were coming too strong! The bath helped me get through them until about 5:00pm, and then I started feeling an intense amount of pelvic pressure that made me want to push.When my doula witnessed this, she knew it was time to head to the hospital. My husband put the last minute things in the car, handed me my labor robe and nightgown to wear and walked me down the stairs to the car. I was worried about the car ride to the hospital, because even though we were close to the hospital, I was contracting every two minutes. I didnt want to get out of the bath either because it was such an amazing feeling and the soothing warmth of the water was helping so much with the intense contractions.We arrived at the hospital at 5:30pmOnce I got to the hospital, I completed a cervical exam (my least favorite thing to do while being pregnant!)  I was at 6 cm and a midwife had to double check it because they thought I had broke my water already too. My doula and I were stunned that they said that I broke it because I didnt feel anything at all! That same day, Ihad lost my mucus plug however, which I had been looking forward to seeing as a sign of labor. It was one of those things I was looking for every time Iused the bathroom but never found prior to that day. As soon as we got settled into thedelivery room, one of my first contractions broke my water. It was the loudest pop Id ever heard inside my body and it brought on a flood of emotions (no pun intended!). It still baffles me that they thought I had already broke it!My doula whispered to me, things are about to speed up, so lets get the tub ready. The tub in the delivery room had thesemagical massaging jets that I didnt have at home and I was really excited about that. My contractions were coming really fast and very hard in the tub. So hard that the jets no longer felt good and after a few minutes, I begged andscreamed to turn the jets off. It got so hot, I thought Iwas going to melt. Thank goodness for the cooler of coconut water my husband brought to the delivery room  I think I drank about 4 bottles within just a few hours. And this whole time, my sweet nurse was trying to monitor the babys heart beat which for some reason really made me uncomfortable, the tiny bit of pressure from the hand held doppler on my pelvis was driving me nuts!In transition, I was loud like an animal!I screamed like an animal for a couple of hours (my throat hurt so bad the next day  so remember to bring some organic throat dropswith you mamas!). Giving birth is such a primal experience, and I never thought I would hear the sounds that would come out of my mouth. I was in full gorilla ape mode! Leading up to my birth, I thought I would be a quiet birther but heck no! Making the animal sounds really helped me get through the intensity.My doctor, who is a huge advocate for natural birth and very supportive of my birth plan, arrived at the scene. I was SO HAPPY to see her. I was progressing so fast and when I got out of the tub, I couldnt believe it  I was fully dilated and ready to push about 8:45pm.Pushing was very athletic!I got back to the delivery bedand tried to find some positions that would be the bestto push in. As many mamas know, laying on your back is not really the most comfortable position during contractions or pushing, and my birth team had some other tricks up their sleeve. It ended up being that asquat bar and laying on my side were what worked best for me. So I used both of those positions throughout my pushing.At this point, I had been laboring for about 18 hours and I was tired! But the pain was not that bad, nothing worse than what I had already experienced up until that point.At first it took me awhile to get a hang of pushing. I had been breathing heavily through contractions, and my birth team reallywanted me to push through contractions while holding my breath  the opposite of what I had been doing all day long! That was difficult for me and really stressed out my body. I felt intense pain on my chest, holding my breath and almost like I was drowning from the lack of oxygen!I eventually got the hang of it and only pushed for an hour and a half before my daughter was born at 10:11pm.The final pushes were really athletic and it took everything in me to focus  I felt the ring of fire, but it wasnt as bad as I expected. When she finally came out, I heard the doctor do something (but didnt really know what was happening at the time because I couldnt believe I just pushed her out) and then she checked to see if I tore, and said everything looked great  no tears to stitch!In absolute aweIwas so stunned and so in awe when my daughter was born the sense of accomplishment the excitement of seeing her for the first time everything that you dream about. It is so magical and the feeling of relief is so instant that everything you did up until that point becomes a BILLION times worth it!For every birth video I had seen since I became pregnant, I cried at the end when the baby was born. Even reading a birth story, I would cry at the end. But when my own baby came, I didnt cry. I was just so happy and I felt my heart exploding with love! I will never ever be able to equate giving birth to anything else Ive ever accomplished in my life. It is definitely my greatest achievement and was so thankful everything went as I had hoped.After the birth, we waited until the cord stopped pulsating and my husband cut the cord, I got to spend a lot of time skin to skin with my baby and breastfeeding, but the baby nurse did take her away to weigh her, measure her, clean out her nasal passages and mouth and take a blood sample to test her blood sugar (which in hindsight  I wish I would have waited for). It felt like an eternity those few minutes she was out of my arms!We spent about 36 hours more at the hospital before going homeThe next morning, I really just wanted to take my baby in my arms and say peace out, but I had to stay to monitor my blood pressure that was high after birth. Thankfully it has been treated naturally since leaving the hospital and is back down. They did prescribe me some pharmaceuticalsfor high blood pressure to take at home before I left (which I didnt end up taking). I know my body, and knew it would be back to normal in a flash, if I rested and allowed my body recover from the lack of sleep and exhaustion!I also had a wonderful at home acupuncture treatment about 5 days later that worked like a miracle for my blood pressure and sore muscles.More details emerge about my birthWhen mydoula came over for a postpartum visit, I learned that my baby was born with the cord wrapped around her neck, this is what I heard my doctor taking care of, but didnt see it when she was coming out. My doctor gently looped the cord back over her head before the rest of her body came out, and the cord was long enough that it didnt pose any danger during the delivery, thank God! It was kinda scary learning about this days later, but it is a really very common thing to happen. Its amazing that a safe natural birth is still possible in circumstances like this!Having strong support is a must!I know I couldnt have achieved a natural child birth without the coaching of a doula, a supportive doctor, and a very positive and helpful nurse  I had the A Team for sure! Giving birthis like a marathon. At a marathon, at every water stop along the way, you have people cheering you on with motivational signs and encouragingyou to finish. You need the same support while giving birthbecause there are so many times you think to yourself that you cant do it or youre not sure if it is possible or if something will go wrong and you are tired! You need thatpositive energy in the room to get you through it. There were a few moments during labor where I asked the team can I do this? and they would say yes,you can do this, and that really motivated me. Taking drugs, however, did not enter my mind once! I credit this to my daily practice ofbirth affirmation cardsleading up to the birth.I feel incredibly lucky I got to experience natural hospital birth, which I know is not often the case for many.There were times when I thought I willnever, ever, ever have another child while I was going through the really tough parts of labor (the point where my water broke to the point where I started pushing), but that thought went 100% out the window after meeting my baby and the high that I felt of accomplishing my goal of a natural childbirth. I will take 10 babies please!!!! Mr. Food Babe, are you ready? haha.A heartfelt thank you to my extended birth team!I want to thank my magical birth team: my dear husband who was 100% supportive of my decision to go natural and even more incredible now as a new Dad, all of the women in my life that shared their advice, birth stories and wisdom with me, Genevieve from Mama Naturalfor her amazing birth course and affirmation cards, Megan from Detoxinista, Latham Thomas from Mama Glow, my sister-in-law Judy who has given natural birth twice!, my trainers atHilliard Studio MethodandK.O.

My Favorite Moments From 2016 – See Which Food Companies Are Dropping The Toxins!,http://foodbabe.com/2016/12/29/my-favorite-moments-from-2016-see-which-food-companies-are-dropping-the-toxins/,"Weve come a long way Food Babe Army! 2016 was full of surprises and a lot of turmoil  but there was so much good to reflect on, these are some of my favorite moments of 2016At a recent conference, executives fromlegacy food companies agreed thatconsumers want to buy clean, healthy food and that this isnt just a fad  its here to stay.Iconic food brands are now on a real food journey,removing artificial additives and eliminating harmful farming practices (like routine antibiotics). They are moving in the right direction and they arent alone.The good food revolution is in full force thanks to the Food Babe Army, activist organizations and countless consumers that are taking back their health!When I look back on 2016, one of the things Im so proud of isseeing the public become increasingly aware of the unethicaltactics employed by the food and chemical companies to mislead consumers. Thanks largely to the work done by consumerinterest groups like U.S. Right to Know, Food and Water Watch,Center for Food Safety and The Cornucopia Institute we now see exactly how companiesuse front groups, scientists, and other paid experts to conduct covert public relationsfor them. The Food Babe Army has been very instrumental in spreading the word and we are creating a better informed public! We now know why they are attacking us for simply asking for healthy food and how to fight back. There are some big revelations on this front to come next year, and I couldnt be more proud of the amazing work that we are doing together. The Food Babe Army Rocks!!!The Most Loved Instagram Posts of 2016!JanuaryCampbells labels GMO ingredients (January 7, 2016)  The new year started out with a bang when one of the largest food corporations in the U.S. announced they will begin labeling GMOs on all of their products, which includePepperidge Farm, Prego, Plum Organics and V8, and they anticipate that labeling will be complete within 12 to 18 months. We had previously exposed the GMOs in their products here, and the Food Babe Army showedour thanks to Campbells for being the first major brand to label the GMOs in their products in the U.S.All the letters you sent to Campbells thanking them for labeling GMOs  So nice of them to acknowledge our efforts!Vani Harinamed one of Americas 50 Most Powerful People in Food for 2016 by The Daily Meal(January 27, 2016) I was honored to make this list as one of the watchdogs, the inspirers, the facilitators of the food movement in America.

This is a campaign that we have been working on since 2012 (see here, here, here, and here) and these posts have been shared hundreds of thousands of times. Starbucks used to claim that their ingredients were proprietary and refused to disclose  so this is a huge win for transparency!FebruaryMars removes artificial colors from candies (February 5, 2016)  The maker of M&Ms, Skittles, and Starburst willremove all artificial colors from all of their products(excluding pet foods) within the next 5 years. Renee Shutters (an activist consumer) and The Center For Science In The Public Interest petitioned to remove the dyes from M&Ms, and received over 217K signatures!Vani Harinamed one of The 13 Most Powerful Women in Food by The Daily Meal (February 19, 2016)  Pretty surreal a food activist was on this list with Oprah Winfrey and the CEOs of major food companies!Perdueschicken strips go antibiotic-free (February 26, 2016) Perdue announced that they would eliminate chicken raised on antibiotics from their chicken strips and nuggets sold in grocery stores by June 2016. This just goes to show that it doesnt need to take YEARSto accomplish this! This makes them the largest supplier of antibiotic-free chicken strips in the U.S. Yet, this is still only a portion of the chicken that Purdue produces, so I am still waiting for them to eliminate the routine use of antibiotics across their entire product line. We have campaigned along with dozens of consumer interest groups to to stop the dangerous routine use of antibiotics on farms and we are slowly chipping away at it (see here, here, here, here, and here).MarchThe Food Babe Way is released in paperback!  My first book,The Food Babe Way,was a #1 bestseller & New York Times Best Seller  selling more books than any other book the week that it was released in 2015.

Theres a way to survive and look good without dieting, and this book contains the 21 essential habits that I taught myself to take control of my health. It is now available in paperback online here.AtThe Natural Living Expo in Boston, MAIn-N-Out Burger commits to stopping routine antibiotic use (March 2, 2016)  On February 24th, I joined over 50 public interest and consumer advocacy groups in sending a letter to In-N-Out Burger, asking them to phase out the routine use of antibiotics across all of their meat supply chains(as well as usingbeta-agonists and growth hormones) and also to provide a more healthful and sustainable grass-fed option on the menu. The following week, In-N-Out Burger responded by telling reporters,Our company is committed to beef that is not raised with antibiotics important to human medicine, and weve asked our suppliers to accelerate their progress towards establishing antibiotic alternatives.Although they stated they are moving in that direction, they have not provided a timeline, so this fight is not over. Heres more about whats in their food.General Mills labels GMO ingredients (March 18, 2016)  Two days after the DARK Act was initially defeated by the Senate, General Mills was the first company to announce that they will label GMOs on all of their products within the U.S.Their product line includes Yoplait, Betty Crocker, Pillsbury, Chex, Progresso, and Fruit By The Foot.

They are the largest canned soup maker in the U.S., so this is huge!Del Monte joins the Food Babe Army (March 29, 2015)  Del Monte told reporters that they will begin to move away from GMOs and that they would add non-GMO labels to their products that dont contain them. When I thanked Del Monte on Twitter for their decision  they told me: We are happy to join your #FoodBabeArmy! these brands are listening to us!!!

This synthetic preservative is a form of butane (a very toxic gas) and has been linked to vision disturbances, liver enlargement, childhood behavioral problems, and stomach cancer in animal studies. New research coming out of Michigan State University links it to the rise in food allergies, which has prompted more research. Although the FDA allows TBHQin America, itis banned for use in food in other countries including Japan. Cheez-It took notice and responded that they are actively testing a number of natural alternatives to TBHQ  but how many more people will continue to consume TBHQ before they change it?SeptemberIn September, I spoke at the Hawaii-Center for Food Safetys event called the Ethics of Eating. The Center For Food Safetyisa nonprofit organization that promotes organic and sustainable agriculturewith work focusing on the public health impacts of the pesticides and herbicides used on GMOs, and because of this, they are heavily targeted by the biotech companies who are profiting off of these chemicals and technologies. Despite unethical efforts by the biotech industry to disrupt my talk, we had a packed house and standing room only! We streamed the eventlive on Facebookand it was a huge success. Thank you Hawaii-Center For Food Safety for the incredible hospitality and of course, for hiring additional security to keep the event on track!Ethics of Eating Talk at The University of Hawaii,09/15/2016Healthy Futures SALT Salonhosted by The Center For Food Safety, Honolulu, HawaiiStouffers simplifies ingredients in their lasagna (September 6, 2016)  Nestle reformulated their recipe and removedautolyzed yeast extract (hidden MSG), carrageenan, dextrose and bleached wheat flour from their Stouffers Lasagna.

The Food Babe Army shared this investigation so much that it was read by millions of people over the last couple years. Informed consumers like usstopped buying JELL-O and look what they had to do! Beware that the old toxic version of JELL-O with artificial colors and BHA is still in stores and this is just a new line that they have created  so continue to check the ingredient list on any product you buy!Buitonigoes non-GMO (October 25, 2016) Buitoni announced that they will remove the GMOs from their pastas and sauces.NovemberCarrageenan to be removed from organic food (November 17, 2016) -The National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) declares that carrageenan will no longer be permitted in organic food by 2018.

Its been shown to be a dangerous and potent inflammatory agent (and possible carcinogen), so it has no business being in our food. This is a HUGE win for consumers.

My Favorite Healthy Pregnancy Foods!,http://foodbabe.com/2016/09/28/healthypregnancyfoods/,"Im in the home stretch of my first pregnancy and I thought it would be fun to give you a little insight into what Ive been eating! If youve been following me on social media (Instagram:thefoodbabe & foodbabemama), you know I am a very non-processed organic real food gal! Ive been taking my commitment to staying on track with my eating principles even more seriously while pregnant and even while indulging in the occasional treat. My latest obsession is frozen grapes to curb that sudden sweet tooth Im experiencing this month. Ive never had such a roller coaster of cravings before in my life (I know you other pregnant women can relate!). The first trimester was all things salty and heavy like breads, crackers and pastasand now in my second trimester its salads, vegetables and desserts  I can only imagine what the third trimester will bring with the holidays coming up!While youve got a growing baby inside you, its more important than ever to nourish your body with the right foods. You need to keep yourself healthy while preparing for labor and motherhood, and you also are providing your baby everything it needs to be strong and healthy. In the second trimester, your baby can actually start to taste the food you are eating! Knowing that gives me serious motivation to stay away from controversial food additives and processed foods that screw with your sense of taste or satisfaction!Ive been doing a lot of research into the specific nutrients that I need during pregnancy, and compiled a list here of my favorite pregnancy foods for all of the other new mommas-to-be out there. I also included some of my favorite recipes here too, to make it easy for you to add these foods to your diet.Keep in mind that there are a few foods that pregnant women should avoid like deli meats, raw cheese and some fish and sushi, but, most healthy foods are fair game! Of course, always ask your doctorif there are any specific foods you should be avoiding.New research out of the U.K. is finding a link between mothers who ate a diet of sugary and high-fat processed foods during pregnancy and ADHD in their children.As you probably know, Im already pretty careful about the food I eat and mostly stick to whole unprocessed foods. That being said, there are some specific nutrients that are known to be especially important to eat during pregnancy  so if you arent eating them already, now is the time!My Favorite Foods For Pregnancy:1. Beans & LentilsFolate (a water soluble B vitamin) is one of the most important nutrients to eat if you are either pregnant or hoping to get pregnant. Folate has been shown to protect against neural tube defects in newborns, so many experts advise eating up to 400 to 600 micrograms of folate leading up to and during pregnancy. Instead of eating the synthetic version (folic acid) found fortified cereals and breads, seek out natural sources of folate found in whole foods. Beans and lentils are some of the best natural sources out there, so add them to your meals often! Beans are also high in iron, another crucial nutrient during pregnancy. Your body needs almost twice the amount of iron while you are pregnant and you are at a greater risk of developing anemia or labor and delivery complications when you arent getting enough. This is especially important if you are a vegan or vegetarian!Recipes to try:Chickpea Curry WrapsLentil Detox SaladPumpkin Black Bean ChiliCauliflower Lentil Taco SaladSprouted Lentil Stuffed PeppersGreen ChiliI love lentil pasta from Tolerant  try it at Thrive Market.2. Green DrinksSmoothies and juices made with mostly vegetables are full of vitamins and minerals that help to keep your immune system strong during pregnancy. Folate is also prevalent in most green drinks that are made with leafy greens or beets! Leafy greens like kale and collards are excellent sources of calcium  and if you are a vegan, its especially important to make sure that you are getting enough calcium during pregnancy. Fill up your blender or juicer with greens like romaine lettuce, spinach, turnip greens, mustard greens, parsley, and collard greens. Throw some ground flaxseeds into your green smoothies to add an additional boost of folate and nutrients. Warning: Try not to overdo the beet juice, I did that once in my first Trimester and lets just say it did not stay down! Its always good to remember natural foods when juiced can be very potent too.Recipes to try:Anti-Inflammatory SmoothieKickin Kale JuiceCherry Berry SmoothieCabbage Patch Kid JuiceSunrise Green SmoothieBanana Bread Hemp Smoothie (use spinach or romaine for the most folate)3. FigsFigs are amazing for you during pregnancy, as they are rich sources of folate, calcium, and iron  all especially important nutrients to eat during pregnancy. The vitamin K in figs is helpful for proper blood clotting, which is necessary during childbirth and helps you to recover. Figs are said to have a sedative effect on your mood, so they can help to keep you feeling happy and positive during your pregnancyoh yeah! They are also packed with fiber to help keep things moving.  Recipe to try:Fig Newton SaladTry stuffing a dried fig with a walnut for a quick snack4. Chia SeedsChia seeds are packed with omega-3 fatty acids (more than any other plant food). You may want to limit or avoid eating fish during pregnancy due to its mercury content, but you still need to make sure youre getting your omega-3s! Your body can convert the type of omega-3s in chia seeds (AHA) to make DHA, which growing babies need for healthy brain development. Chia seeds keep you full by slowing down your digestion and help to keep your blood sugar in check. Chia seeds are also high in antioxidants and very high in minerals like calcium and iron, of which your body requires more of during pregnancy. Recipes to try:Chia Seed Fruit SaladPeach Chia Green SmoothieApple Pie Chia Pudding5. CoconutAll forms of coconut (water, milk, oil, meat) are super good for you during pregnancy! Coconuts (especially the water) provide both calcium and magnesium, which are essential for the developing baby  and if you dont eat enough, your body will take it from your bones putting you at risk for osteoporosis. Coconut water is also excellent for replenishing your body if youre experiencing morning sickness. Some people swear that the electrolytes in coconut water can also alleviate painful leg swelling during pregnancy.Coconut oil is antiviral and boosts your immunity to help keep you from getting sick, and the fat will help your body process fat-soluble vitamins to give you and your baby more nutrition from the foods you eat. Applying the oil to your growing belly can also prevent stretch marks. Coconuts are full of lauric acid, which can enhance your breast milk after you deliver your baby. Fresh coconut is always best, but when buying packaged versions choose organic products that are minimally processed without sugar and additives. Check out my buying tips for coconut water, coconut milk, and oils before you head to the store.

Fresh GingerHere Im talking about fresh ginger root  not supplements! It can be dangerous to take ginger supplements during pregnancy because they are so potent, and you would want to ask your doctor before taking supplements or eating fresh ginger to be on the safe side. Its been shown that fresh ginger is likely safe during pregnancy as long as you dont overdo it  and can be really beneficial. Ginger can help to relieve morning sickness. It also increases your circulation and supplies your body with iron and vitamin C. Recipes to try:One-Ingredient Ginger TeaClassic Real Ginger CookiesHomemade Real Ginger AleCandied Ginger7. Carrots (and other orange produce like Mangos!)The beta-carotene (provitamin A) in thesehelp your growing baby develop healthy eyes and organs. It also helps to prepare your body for childbirth because it helps with postpartum tissue repair  so, make sure to eat lots of thesewhen you are close to your due date! The magnesium in mangos are also a useful remedy for leg cramps.Recipes to try:Hummus Mezze Plate With Carrot SticksMango LassiProtein Rich Carrot Ginger Lentil SoupRoasted Beet & Carrot Salad8. Fresh BasilIt seems so simple, but this delicious herb is packed with nutrients that your pregnant body needs like iron, calcium, and folate. Fresh basil is also rich in numerous vitamins and other minerals that help to keep you from getting sick. Just make sure you pick up the fresh basil leaves (and not the dried version in jars) from the store. Its also super easy to grow at home in a sunny window. The easiest way to add this to your diet is to throw some into a green salad or you could layer it over slices of tomatoes and drizzle with balsamic vinegar.Recipes to try: Creamy Avocado & Sweet Pea PastaVegetable Lasagne With No NoodlesMini Vegetable Frittatas9. AvocadosAvocados are one of the richest sources of vitamin B6, which helps relieve morning sickness in some people. This vitamin is also excellent for proper brain development in the womb. Avocados are also loaded with folate, potassium and vitamin C.Recipes to try:Quinoa Avocado TacosAvocado Berry Banana Breakfast SmoothieCoconut Avocado FriesAvocado & Carrot Salad10.Pumpkin SeedsWhen you are pregnant your body produces more red blood cells to help your baby grow, and thats why its important to eat enough iron everyday. Pumpkin seeds are one of the best sources of iron, along with folate and omega 3 fatty acids to help with fetal brain development.These are easy to add to your diet. You can snack on them, throw them in smoothies, or top salads with them.Recipes to try:Kale Slaw SaladPapaya Pineapple Protein Smoothie11. Fermented Foods and PrebioticsProbiotics and prebiotics are both important and Im glad folks are starting to learn more about why you need healthy bacteria in your gut. In Chinese Medicine, they believe that most diseases start from the gut. Its all about whether or not your healthy bacteria can crowd out the bad. The fermentation process increases the nutritional value of food. Many fermented foods are good sources of K2 (a vitamin that is rare in most diets and good for your baby) and B vitamins, including B-12.I love to add fermented veggies (like kimchi) to my plate almost everyday.I also take a probiotic everyday first thing in the morning for my insurance that I have a belly full of good bacteria. You can find it in the refrigerator section at vitamins stores or natural food markets and make sure to choose one with an enteric coating that allows the pill to slowly be absorbed by your body throughout the day.Its also essential to regularly eat foods that naturally contain Prebiotics  this is the stuff that feeds the good bacteria thats already in your gut and helps it to grow. Prebiotic-rich foods include whole foods like radishes, bananas, onions, garlic, leeks, radicchio, asparagus, artichokes, and legumes.Recipes to try:Homemade YogurtKimchiMiso SoupAsparagus Lemon Quinoa RisottoAsparagus Hazelnut Salad12. Wild Fish (low-mercury varieties)  Salmon, Trout, Sardines, Shrimp andHerringSome in the nutrition world opt to completely eliminate fish from their diets while pregnant and go for a supplement instead. But Ive read about too many positive reasons to eat low-mercury fish twice a week for a growing baby. For example in one large Danish study, children whose mothers ate the most fish during pregnancy (an average of 14 ounces a week) had better motor and cognitive skills at 6 months and at 18 months than those whose mothers ate little fish. And those whose mothers ate the least fish had the lowest developmental scores. And this becomes even more important when you are breastfeeding after the baby is born too. One rule of thumb  I avoid the highest mercury fish like the plague  Tuna, Marlin, Shark, Swordfish, etc. Recipes to try:Wild Salmon Cakes With Fresh ArugulaThe Best Salmon EverI have to admit, it was hard limiting this list to just 12! There are so many more amazingly delicious foods that are healthy to eat during pregnancy (or anytime!) so these are just some of my personal favorites. If you havent tried any of thembefore, I hope this motivates youto try something new!If you know anyone who is pregnant (or is trying to be), sharethis post to them.Heres to all of us having healthy and happy pregnancies!Xo,Vani14.1K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

Protein Powder To Never Buy Again (And What To Choose Instead)!,http://foodbabe.com/2016/08/25/protein-powders-to-never-buy-again-and-what-to-choose-instead/,"I get a lot of questions about protein shakes and powders. Many of you want to know if I drink them, which brands I recommend, what types of protein are the best, which ones to avoidetc.The truth is that most protein powders on the market are filled with highly processed denatured proteins, preservatives, GMOs, and tons of additives. Many areso expensive but also at the same time can be some of the lowest quality ingredients you can buy!Let me give you an example of a protein powderthat I would NEVER buyEAS Soy Protein Powder: Soy Protein Isolate, Fructose, Cocoa Powder (Processed with Alkali), Natural & Artificial Flavor, and Soy Lecithin.This protein powder is not certified organic or non-GMO project verified  so it can contain GMO ingredients. The soy likely comes from Roundup Ready soybeans (a GMO) that is engineered to be doused with Monsantos herbicide glyphosate.The World Health Organizations International Agency for Research on Cancer deemed glyphosate probably carcinogenic  This is definitely not something you should be supplementing your diet with!Besides being GMO, I avoid soy protein because when soy is isolated to just its protein state it becomes denatured and can cause hormonal disruptions. It also endures an extreme amount of chemical processing to become isolated  so it is not what I consider real food.Heres another popular one I wouldnt buyIsoPure Zero Carb Protein (Vanilla): Ion Exchange Whey [Milk] Protein Isolate, Microfiltered Whey [Milk] Protein Isolate, Vitamin/Mineral/Amino Acid Blend, (Taurine, Potassium [As Potassium Chloride], Chloride [As Potassium And Sodium Chloride], Calcium [As Dicalcium Phosphate Dihydrate], Phosphorus [As Dicalcium Phosphate Dihydrate], L-Glutamine, Magnesium [As Magnesium Oxide], Vitamin C [As Ascorbic Acid], Vitamin E [As DL-Alpha Tocopheryl Acetate], Niacin, Zinc [As Zinc Sulfate Dihydrate], Vitamin A [As Palmitate], Pantothenic Acid [As D-Calcium Pantothenate], Vitamin B6 [As Pyridoxine Hydrochloride], Copper [As Amino Acid Chelate], Manganese [As Manganese Sulfate Dihydrate], Riboflavin, Thiamin [As Thiamin Hydrochloride], Folic Acid, Biotin, Iodide [As Potassium Iodide], Chromium [As Amino Acid Chelate], Vitamin K, Molybdenum [As Amino Acid Chelate], Selenium [As Amino Acid Chelate], Vitamin B12), Soy Lecithin, Natural And Artificial Flavors, Xanthan Gum, Sucralose.This artificially flavored protein powder is made from whey protein that is not certified organic, so it likely comes from cows that were raised on GMOs, growth hormones, antibiotics and other drugs. It also contains the artificial sweetener sucralose (Splenda) which is linked to leukemia. The Center for Science in the Public Interest says sucralose is not safe and should be avoided.This next protein powder seems pretty clean, but I still wouldnt buy itVega One Nutritional Shake (French Vanilla): Pea protein, whole flaxseed (micro-milled), organic acacia gum (naturally occurring fiber), hemp protein, SaviSeedTM (sacha inchi) protein, organic gelatinized maca root, organic broccoli, inulin (from chicory root), organic spirulina, organic kale, organic marine algae calcium, fruit & vegetable blend (spinach, broccoli, carrot, beet, tomato, apple, cranberry, orange, blueberry and/or bilberry, strawberry, shiitake mushroom), chlorella vulgaris (cracked whole cell), papaya extract, probiotics (bacillus coagulans [provides 1 billion cfu/serving]), antioxidant fruit blend (grape seed extract, organic pomegranate, aai, mangosteen, organic goji, organic maqui), Contains 2 percent or less of: natural vanilla flavor, natural caramel flavor, stevia extract, citric acid.This shake is not certified organic, including the first two ingredients, which means that they may have been treated with synthetic pesticides. Roundup herbicide is also used as a desiccant (drying agent) on some non-organic peas and flaxseed crops. Since I try to avoid these chemicals, I choose certified organic foods whenever possible! This powder is also sweetened with stevia extract (instead of whole stevia leaf), which goes through a chemical-laden process.I cant tell you how many times Ive been askedto review this next shake (a lot!) and again, this is one that I wouldnt buyIsagenix IsaLean Shake (Strawberry Cream): Exclusive Myo-IsaLean Complex [whey protein concentrate (undenatured), milk protein concentrate (undenatured), low heat nonfat dry milk], isomaltooligosaccharide powder, fructose, sunflower (Helianthus annuus) oil powder, natural strawberry flavors, olive (Olea europaea) oil powder, tapioca maltodextrin, flax (Linum usitatissimum) seed powder, xanthan gum, medium chain triglyceride oil powder, Ionic Alfalfa (Medicago sativa) leaf extract, natural flavors, beet juice powder, magnesium oxide, tricalcium phosphate, potassium citrate, enzyme blend [lactase (from Aspergillus oryzae), lipase (from Rhizopus oryzae), cellulase (from Trichoderma longibrachiatum), invertase (from Saccharomyces cerevisiae), protease (from Aspergillus oryzae), amylase (from Bacillus subtilis), bromelain (from Ananas comosus), papain (from Carica papaya), acid stable protease (from Aspergillus niger)], magnesium citrate, sea salt, stevia (Stevia rebaudiana) leaf extract, silicon dioxide, yucca (Yucca schidigera) root powder, vitamin C (ascorbic acid), magnesium stearate, psyllium (Plantago ovata) seed powder, biotin, selenium amino acid chelate, vitamin E succinate, copper amino acid chelate, vitamin A (beta carotene), zinc oxide, manganese amino acid chelate, iodine amino acid chelate, niacinamide, d-calcium pantothenate, vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), chromium amino acid chelate, niacin, molybdenum amino acid chelate, vitamin B6 (pyridoxine HCl), vitamin B12 (cyanocobalamin), riboflavin, Lactobacillus acidophilus, thiamine HCl, folic acid.This protein powder is not organic! Although Isagenix claimsthey make every effort not to use GMOs, this shake is not Non-GMO Project Verified or certified organic so there is a chance that some of the ingredients (such as the fructose) are derived from GMOs. While their website statestheir whey comes from New Zealand cows fed on a pasture, they readily admit, we have also sought other suppliers in Australia and the U.S. who meet the same standards for dairy protein.Without the certified organic orcertified grassfed label, there is the possibility that the cows were raised with some GMO feed. The amount of sugar in this shake is pretty high too at 11 grams per serving, which is almost 3 teaspoons! Although this powder is filled with vitamins and minerals, these dont come directly from real food. The ingredients within the natural flavors in this shake are not identified on the label. Flavors can contain up to 100 ingredients, including synthetic chemicals such as the solvent propylene glycol or the preservative BHA as well as GMO-derived ingredients.Another twoI get asked about all the time that arent organic eitherShakeology (Greenberry): Proprietary Superfood Blend, Protein Blend (Whey Protein Isolate (milk), Pea protein, Flax (seed), Chia (seed), Quinoa (seed)), Chlorella (whole plant), Pea fiber (seed), Spirulina, Yacon (root), Cordyceps (fungi), Camu-Camu (fruit), Acerola cherry (fruit), Chicory fiber (root), Spinach leaf, Pomegranate (fruit), Astragalus (fruit), Bilbury (fruit), Blueberry (fruit), Lycium berry (fruit), Maitake (fungi), Reishi (fungi), Rose hips (fruit), MSM (methylsulfonylmethane), Ashwagandha (root), Enzyme Blend (Amylase, Cellulase, Lactase, Glucoamylace, Alpha-galactosidase, Invertase, Kale (leaf), Lactobacillus sporogenes, Shisandra (fruit), Maca (root), Luo Han Guo (fruit), Cinnamon (bark), Green tea extract (leaf), Moringa (leaf), Sacha inchi (seed), Other ingredients (non-GMO Fructose, Xanthan Gum, Natural Strawberry Flavor (with other natural flavors), Citric acid, Himalayan salt, Stevia extract (leaf).Thisshake is also not certified organic or Non-GMO Project Verified, but even ifall the ingredients are non-GMO, there is a BIG difference between organic and non-GMO ingredients  These ingredients can still contain synthetic pesticides and thats why I choose certified organic foods whenever possible. This is especially important if you are drinking a protein shake daily, as many people do! The whey is also isolated, which is a heavily processed form and is not the best way to consume it.Arbonne Vanilla Protein Shake Mix:Protein Matrix Blend (pea protein isolate, cranberry protein, rice protein), sugar cane, sunflower oil, natural vanilla flavor, inulin, maltodextrin, flax seed, stevia leaf extract, xanthan gum, gum acacia, guar gum.This protein isnt certified organic or Non-GMO Project Verified  which is the first reason to not to use this powder. Its also sweetened with stevia extract, which to me, leaves an odd after taste in your mouth, and they add several gums which are not necessary.You can still supplement with protein and avoid heavily processed protein powders like these!I typically prefer to make protein smoothies from scratch with real nutrient-dense foods  but this is not always the most convenient option. I realize there are times when you just need to whip up a quick protein shake and run out the door or want something while traveling  without worrying about poisoning yourself with unnecessary chemicals. Now that I am pregnant, I need extra protein for my growing baby, but want to make sure I am getting it from the safest sources.Its important to note that I dont like consuming additional no-calorie sweeteners like stevia extract and erythritol on a daily basis. The extra sweet sensation screws with my taste buds and Id rather have my daily drinks sweetened with fruit and other natural sources that dont mess with myhunger signals.Thats why I love Nutivas brand new protein powder: Organic Plant Protein Superfood 30 Shake.Nutivas shake is made from certified organic whole food plant proteins  no processed whey or isolated soy and contains 20 grams of protein per serving. This shake is a blend of organic pea, pumpkin, sunflower, chia, hemp and sacha inchi proteins, along with 30 superfoods including reishi mushroom, baobab, moringa, kale, hawthorn berry, purple corn, sea buckthorn, kelp and cinnamon.It also tastes amazing, despite having no fake flavors, nasty chemical additives, and only 2g of sugar per serving. Unlike other protein manufacturersthatnever tell you whatsin their natural or organic flavors, Nutiva uses a vanilla organic flavor where they actually list whats in it  vs. hiding it! All of these ingredients areORGANIC too  so they are not using Roundup-Ready GMO corn andthey use all organic ingredients to make the carriers for the flavors! This is a huge deal, not just with transparency, but the high level quality of each ingredient they choose. Also note  the sugars in the product come mostly from plants and fruits  not added sugaror stevia (which I think makes most protein powders taste kinda too sweet and some nasty!)Im so happy that Nutivaformulated the BEST plant protein powder out there!Do you know someone still consuming protein powders with terrible ingredients? If so, please share this post with them and spread the word!Xo,VaniP.S. Still confused on protein powders? Remember, if your protein powder is not certified organic, its not worth putting it in your body  especially on a regular basis.

Does Your Body Cleanse Itself? Is Detoxing Really A Myth?,http://foodbabe.com/2016/08/16/does-your-body-cleanse-itself-is-detoxing-really-a-myth/,"How many times have you heard on the Internet or from an expert on TV, theres no such thing as detoxing, theres no SCIENCE behind it and your body cleanses itself? If youve questioned the word detox like many out there, then you definitely want to read this, and then decide for yourself if what they are leading you to believe is true or not.What do you think it REALLYmeans to be healthy? Does it mean that you are not sick? Does it simply mean the absence of diseaseor does being healthy mean so much more than that? Could being healthymean that not only are you NOT sick, but you are thriving, happy, and full of energy?Im sure many of you agree that there is so much more to being healthy than just the absence of health problems, especially since these usually take years to surface and can remain hidden for long time. In my personal life, not only have I been able to get off of several prescription medications for eczema, asthma and allergies, but I feel better and healthier than ever!But what if I didnt do anything to change my diet? What if I just believed the experts who said your body detoxes naturally  and theres nothing you can do to make it detox any faster or better. What if I just listened to their advice and trusted that my body was going to be able to continue to detox itself just fine from all the soda, fast food and candy I was eating filled with a slew of controversial synthetic additives, pesticides and plasticizer chemicals from the packaging material  not to mention the daily exposure of suspect chemicals in water, air and the environment I was being exposed to  ?I suppose I could have just stayed hopped up on medicine, just surviving the days, walking around like a zombie!One thing is clear, we might not be able to see toxins, but they are there!Hearing the breaking news that the government has approvedaerial spraying of a chemical that is banned in Europe all over Florida that is linked toneurological disorders and defects in the wombreally opened my eyes. This pesticide  Naled  is moderately to highly toxic whichdegrades into dichlorvos,classified by the EPA as a probable carcinogen. Repeatedexposures to Naled over time may result in the same effects as acute exposuresuch asrespiratoryproblems,vomiting, diarrhea, dizziness, slurred speech, twitching, paralysis, convulsions and coma. Its alarming that this toxic pesticide is routinely being sprayed all over our communities(not just in Florida) to kill mosquitoes  but this is just one example of what our regulatory bodies allow us to beexposed to on a daily basis.Varying amounts of toxic chemicals pesticides, heavy metals, parabens, fertilizers, herbicides, and mold  are consumed by our bodies during normal everyday life. Many of theseset up shop in the body for months or years(sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and are showing up in human urine and blood tests.So how do they endup in our bodies?Many of them come frompesticide-sprayed food, farmed fish, and food packaging materials. Besides the food we eat, everyday items like shampoo, household cleaners, plastic bottles, clothing, furniture, water, and even the air we breathe are all possible sources of toxin exposure. It has been estimated that theaverage person could be harboring about 500 synthetic chemicals in their bodies, and one study found that unborn babies had over 200 toxins in their umbilical cord blood this amount of toxins is no joke!What is a toxin?When I say the word toxin, I am talking about a substance that is harmfulto the body after either after a single exposure(acute) or repeated exposures over time (chronic). While we may not find ourselves at the scene of anaccidental chemical leak (which would be acute exposure), all of usare being chronically exposed tolow-levels of synthetic chemicals repeatedly, day after day. Low-level chronicexposures to synthetic chemicals over time have been shown to have a negative impact on health. (sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11).An unprecedented alliance of 48 of the nations top scientists recently came to a consensusthat thescientific evidence supports a link between exposures to toxic chemicals in our environment (which specifically includeorganophosphate pesticidesthatare sprayed on non-organic food)andneurodevelopmental disorders in children, such asautism and learning disabilities. They are calling out thechemical industry to prove a chemical is safe, rather than waiting on the medical and scientific community to prove it is harmfulandaskingthat food companies get these toxins out of their supply chains so that pregnant women and children are no longer exposed.The problem is that your body cant easily eliminatemany of these toxinsor break them down. They get stored in places like fat tissue and eventually make their way through your bloodstream and invade your brain, lungs, heart, eyes, stomach, liver, and sexual organs. Heavy metals are particularly toxic to your brain cells, where they can cause memory loss, migraines, and premature brain aging.Anyone who eats, drinks, breathes is being exposed to these toxins, we cant escape them. While this isntsomething to livein fear of, we shouldnt pretend that its no big deal and hope that our body will take care of these toxins for us automatically. When you look at the increasing amountschemicals invading our environment, doesnt it just make sense to do whatever we can to mitigate the damage?Sure, its true that our bodies are designed with the natural ability to detox  but that isnt the whole story.Our kidneys, liver, cardiovascular system, and skin are all working hard every day to process all of the substances that come into the body and to expel toxins but they are being pushed to the brink. Even when we eat a good diet and surround ourselves with a healthy environment, the natural system in the body needs help. When our organs are overtaxed and overburdened with toxins, symptoms can creep up such as fatigue, digestion problems, bloating, and muscle aches (sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and while we may appear healthy, this is not the true health that Im talking about! When these symptoms go unchecked and our bodies are not able to detox optimally, we are at risk for greater health problems down the road. (sources: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9).This goes against the mainstream idea that our bodies can process all of the toxins that we are exposed to throughout our lives without any intervention on our part. Many doctors and scientistshave been known to say, your body can handle toxins on its own and that detoxing is a myth  I know youve heard these claims before as they are prevalent in the media.Which drink or food helps your liver work more efficiently? A couple of shots of vodka or green juice? A McDonalds Super Sized Meal or pasture raised chicken with vegetables? I think you know the answer.An article published in the New York Timesearlier this year is a perfect example of how many of the experts quoted in the media paint a different picture and steer people away from the belief that food has any ability to help you detox from poisons.Dr. James H. Grendell is quoted as saying: The human body is well designed to eliminate wastes and toxins, and a number of organs play a role there is no good scientific evidence that a juice cleanse, or any other food for that matter, is particularly relevant to removing toxins.No good scientific evidence? Thats BS!This article really got under my skinbecause Ive seen that there is good evidence that certain foods have remarkable powers and are capable of helping your body flush toxins. Traditional Chinese Medicine and Ayurvedic Medicine have used detoxification and purification techniques for centuries continuing on to today  healing foods, massage, herbs, and fasting  this is not somefad.Just a few examples of how foods can help you detoxGarlic and onions are high in sulfurandcompounds that help to remove heavy metals from the bodyand can also prevent kidney damagecaused by exposure.(sources:1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7) These sulfur-rich foods also help your body produce more glutathione, acritical antioxidant whichlatches onto and carries toxins out of the body(sources: 1, 2).Chlorella (a type of green algae) helps your body eliminateof mercury stored in yourgastrointestinal tract, muscles and bones. If youve never eaten this before, you can try adding it to a green drink!Vitamin B1, which isnaturally foundin peas, spinach, and pistachios, increases the excretion of lead from the body.Likewise, diets with sufficient vitamin B1inhibitsleadabsorption and correlates withlower levels of lead in the blood.Sunflower seeds, avocados,and almondsare high in Vitamin E, an antioxidant shown toprotect the body from methylmercury (sources 1, 2, 3). Avocados in particular canimprove the health of your liver (your bodys primary detoxing organ).Calcium-rich foods like collard greens and almonds protect your body from lead becausemore lead isabsorbed by people on a calcium-poor diet.Lemon juice stimulates the liver and helps your body flush out toxins. (sources: 1, 2).The vitamin C in lemon juiceis alsoused by the body to produce glutathione.(sources: 1, 2, 3, 4)Thats why I do this every morning!Garbanzobeans (chickpeas) and pumpkin seedsare high in zinc, a mineralshown toprotect the kidneysfrom cadmium and caneliminate the symptoms of cadmium toxicity. (sources 1, 2, 3)Cilantro (also called Chinese parsley) enhances your bodys ability to detox from heavy metals such as lead and mercury. (sources 1, 2) It also has been shown to effectively purify drinking water that is contaminated with these toxins!The lactic acid bacteria in kimchi (my favorite fermented food) has been shown to degrade the presence of pesticides. Probiotics also help to protect the body from BPA exposure, and also to detox from heavy metals and cancerous nitrosamines.Beets and milk thistle bothhelp to keep the liver healthy so that it can do its job toremove toxins from the blood. (sources 1, 2, 3)Simply drinking plenty of filtered water every day (not fromplastic bottles!) helps your body eliminate toxins by keeping your kidneys and bowels active.Somethingas basic as fiberin our food helpsto remove toxic waste from the body (sources:1,2)All of us can naturally keep our bodys detox system running optimally at very little cost or effort.The average person doesntneed some fancysupplement or expensive prescription, you can simply eat whole real foods that support the detoxprocess, while avoiding things that are known to tax the liver such as toxic cookingoils (soybean, corn, canola) and sugar.Juicing is an easy way to keep your organs working optimally!There are specific foods that I eat every day to help my body detox  besides drinking lemon water first thing in the morning, I like to add detoxifying ingredientslike dandelion greens, cilantro, and parsley to my salads and green drinks. Juicing is one way that I provide my body with a rich source of nutrients and give my digestive organs a rest.Ive been on several green juice fasts in my life  and I come out feeling better and healthier than ever! I even put together my plan for others to try, because it is so effective you can check it out here.Eating organic can reduce exposure to synthetic chemicals that overtax your bodys natural ability to cleanse Ieatfresh organic produce withevery meal.Choosing organic food helps me avoid organophosphate pesticidesandother hazardouschemicals.My health changed dramatically when I changed my eating habits and started filling my body with organic raw whole foods from all of the colors of the rainbow  leafy greens, red beets, orange carrots, purple cabbage, blueberries as varied as possible! It is no accident that my health improved because there is ample scientific evidence that these types of foods help support the detox process and provideoptimal health!The absolute best thing about eating this way is that the food industry hasnt adulterated your food with industrial chemicals that you need to detox from  artificial colors, flavors, chemicals, pesticides, additives, preservatives, or BPA and other harmful packaging materials. Meal planning and cooking at home with whole real foods is one of the best ways to stay alkaline, provide your body an abundant amount of nutrients on a daily basis, and prevent disease.If you want help eating this way, I invite you to join the Food Babe Eating Guide Program.

The Time I Almost Ate At Taco Bell… (I’ve Been Keeping A Tiny Little Secret!),http://foodbabe.com/2016/07/18/secret/,"I am thrilled to announce we are expecting our own little Food Babe this winter.I know all you moms and dads out there have been waiting for this moment for a long time I laugh just thinking about all the times you said to me Just wait, until you have kidsWell  that time is almost here and you can finally get all your I told ya sos ready to fire!No, but seriously, we are SO EXCITED. Its been really hard to keep this secret from you! Ive been walking around with a ridiculous smile on my face for months trying to hold it in.Im obsessed! Baby investigations are underway! Ive been reading every natural pregnancy and baby book under the sun for the past several months.How it happenedWell I am not going to go into all the exact details (Ill let you use your imagination  haha) but late last year, I knew I was finally ready to be a Mom. My parents werent getting any younger, Mr. Food Babe and I were about to celebrate 10 years of marriage and the more I thought about my role in this life, I knew I really wanted to bring another force for good into the world. I have so many hopes for her  to be brave, confident, powerful, smart and have lots of tenacity!When I looked at my husband and said I was ready, things happened quick. BOOM. I was pregnant. I honestly couldnt believe it  I thought it would take a long time considering all the pregnancy stories and experiences I have heard about with loved ones and close friends, but I am incredibly grateful that it happened so easily for us. We are truly blessed  I cant help but think the years of getting my health to its optimal state had to help  practicing my healthy habits, regular acupuncture and staying away from processed food!Ive never been more hungry in my life! Now that I am pregnant  wow  have my eating habits changed. First of all, not in a million years did I think I would ever crave Taco Bell again. But it happened. I was walking by one on the way to another restaurant and I could literally taste a chicken soft taco and bean burrito in my mouth. Of course I didnt get any  But man! It was the weirdest sensation I have ever experienced, especially considering I havent eaten at Taco Bell since it was like 2am in the morning and I was in college.And then Burger King happened. Yes. That nasty excuse for food. I was in Spain (of all places!) promoting the Spanish version of The Food Babe Way and was stuck in an airport terminal with the smell of charbroiled hamburgers radiating the whole waiting area. I thought I was going to DIE if I didnt have one. But thankfully my years of personal investigation and study of food toxins and industrial factory farming kept me FAR FAR away  there was no way I was going to feed my growing baby that tainted meat on that processed to death sesame seed bun!As you can see, my pregnancy cravings have been INTENSE! To tame them, Ive spent a lot of time making organic comfort food at home  Ive made just about all my childhood favorites  grilled cheese, biscuits, pancakes and more. (Have you seen all the cooking on Snapchat? Follow me at thefoodbabe).I have heard most mamas stop enjoying green vegetables during this time  thankfully that is not the case for me, I still LOVE kale and all things green (with a slice of hot cheese pizza please  haha). Actually my Melt In Your Mouth Kale Salad has been on serious repeat lately and is the one dish that doesnt give me the pregnancy burbs!

"She Gave Up Processed Food, And WHOA! Look At Her Results!",http://foodbabe.com/2016/06/02/she-gave-up-processed-food-and-whoa-look-at-her-results/,"A couple weeks ago I received an email from Shannon, a reader of my bookThe Food Babe Way,and my jaw dropped to the floor! In just the past few months, Shannon has made an incredible transformation toher body  she wentdown 5 sizes in 4 months, but what I think is most important is that her health and fitness has improved dramatically. I am so excitedshe wants to share her story with you.Shannons storyjust goes to show how quickly you can change your body even if nothing else worked for you in the past and that you can still enjoy amazingly delicious food all day, every day!She told my team that she hopes others can relate to her story and that maybe it will inspire them to know that it can be done. I reallylove that she wants to help others, and I am so happy for her and all she has accomplished! Are youready to be inspired?The Before picture that Shannon sent in was taken sometime prior to January 2016 (when she began eating The Food Babe Way) and the After pictures were taken in May 2016:Shannons story:In the beginning: When I was in my teens and early 20s I competed in pageantseven winning swimsuit awards at a few state competitions. Fat-free was all the rage then and I prided myself on eating less than 5 grams of fat a day during competition season. I was muscular, 56 and 125 lbs. Losing weight wasnt easy, but it wasnt hard either back then. I love a lot of diverse foods, but gave up a lot when competing. When I joined the workforce I challenged myself with a job that required a yearly fitness testpush-ups, sit-ups, waist measurement and a timed run. While the amount of my physical activity has ebbed and flowed throughout the years, it has always been a part of my life.What happened: As I moved into my late 20s and early 30s it became harder. I worked out daily, but was still 20 lbs more than when I competed. Folks said thats what happened with age. I was still within my BMI though and felt good, but always had to have a daily nap! When I got married in my early 30s I maintained my weight until I had children. I put on 25 lbs while pregnant, but 25 lbs never came off. Sure, some of it did, but as most new moms can relate it was a struggle. For years I teetered between a normal BMI and what doctors consider overweight. It was frustrating.In 2010, I started actively running, about 4-5 miles a day. I used a stand-up desk because I read it burned 500 extra calories a day. I also started a healthy eating routinewhole grain breads and pastas, yogurt, oatmeal, low-fat dairy, soups, fruits and vegetables. I often had a Lean Cuisine, Weight Watchers or Healthy Choice for lunch. I mean just look at the nameshow could these meals not be good for me? When I traveled for work I ate at Subway. I got back to an acceptable BMI, but that only lasted about 7 months and the scale started to go up again.I remember at my yearly physical I told my doctor about my daily running routine and my healthy diet. When she said, You might have a thyroid issue, I thought YES! Something that explains it. First off, what crazy logic is that to get excited about a possible illness to explain weight gain! Thank God, I did not have a thyroid issue, but what was happening?In 2013, I took on a new, more stressful position, but still went to the gym. I drank coffee with creamer like a fiend in the morning and drank a glass or two of wine at night to unwind. Store bought French bread became a staple at every meal. I always tried to balance the plate with a meat, starch and vege, but again the numbers on the scale kept climbing. I also must admit I have a sweet tooth, but a bit of Dove, Hersheys or M&Ms always seemed to satisfy it. In 2014, we had a British soccer coach stay at our home. We went to the grocery store to buy food for his lunches. He couldnt believe all the choices we had. He told me how many of the foods here were outlawed in England. I thought it was interesting, but didnt give too much more thought to it as I took him through a McDonalds drive thru later that day.By 2015 I had gained all my baby weight back. I was 15 lbs over my BMI and officially dubbed overweight. I felt tired, stressed, unhappy with my appearance and hopeless. In Dec. 2015 I gave away a ton of size 8 clothes thinking Id never, ever be able to wear them again since I had not been able to wear them since 2010.A new chapter: In late 2015, a friend told me about an M.D./nutritionist she was seeing. I quickly made an appointment for after the New Year. On Jan. 7, 2016 I met Dr. B. and she talked to me about gluten and casein allergies, GMOs, glycemic index, organic foods and foods dubbed healthy that would actually sabotage weight loss. I had never heard about GMOs! She gave me a daily caloric plan, recipes, shopping lists and supplements to help me as I changed my eating habits.That weekend we had a snowstorm, so I binge watched every Netflix film I could find on food. FedUp, Food, Inc, Cowspiracy, Forks over Knives, SuperSize Meyep I watched them all. FedUp and Food, Inc. really hit home. I was shocked to learn what Big Food was doing to our food and what little the FDA was doing to protect us. I went through my pantry and got rid of boxed rice and pasta sides. I swapped out whole grain wheat pastas for brown rice, corn and quinoa. I made a few changes, but my low-fat cereals stayed, my Chunky soups stayed, my lunch meats stayedas did many other products that I thought were healthy. In fact, I bought more Gatorade Power Bars for my son. The packaging said 20 grams of protein. We kept the Carnation Breakfast drinks with 11 vitamins and minerals. That stuff had to be good for you right? I mean, the packaging said so.For as long as Ive known my best friend shes always been into food and fitness. She is a wealth of knowledge and an inspiration. When I shared with her my new knowledge she told me about Food Babe. I looked at the Facebook page and was intrigued. I went to the library to get the book. Im not a fast reader, but that book went with me to every soccer game, baseball practice, and carpool line I went to. I knew half-way through that I had to order my own copy. I wanted to dog-ear it, highlight it, tab it.By the middle of the book I was back in my kitchen pantry. I spent three days reading EVERY LABEL in my kitchen. By the third night I wanted to sit on the floor and cry. All these foods I was feeding to my kids were loaded with TBHQ, BHA, hidden MSG, sugar, sugar and more sugar. If I didnt recognize an ingredient I looked it up on the internet. The vast majority were not good. For me, the light bulb went on. This wasnt healthy food. My body had no idea how to process it. It was making me sick and fat and was causing who-knows-what damage to my kids. I did another clean out and started looking for other alternatives to baked crackers, granola bars and peanut butter.I must tell readers that Ive been through my pantry and freezer at least six or seven times. Food has an emotional pull either because we are addicted to the taste or we cant wrap our minds around the cost of getting rid of it. My taste buds started to change after the first month, but my wallet still cringed at the thought that I had just bought a club-price pack of turkey bacon and years supply of Eggo waffles (Ok, not really a year, but certainly a months worthmaybe two).The turning point came as I started to see the scale go lower and lower each week. Pounds were coming off like crazy! Real food tasted great. I was cooking and finding new recipes to satisfy my needs and my sweet tooth (Yep, Babes Almond Butter Fudge recipe rocks!) I remember I left for a business trip and my husband found the last pack of frozen, processed lunch meat. When I came home I was so disgusted by it that I immediately threw it away. He came home a few days later looking for it as I feigned like I didnt hear him ask me, What happened to the lunch meat? I finally had to confess that I threw it away. It wasnt good for any of us. I promised to make an organic chicken weekly so that he would have lunch meat.When I went to the gym I talked to people who looked fit and healthy. Fitness instructors are a wealth of knowledge, as are many people who take their classes. Id ask a question during class about food and get three or four varying answers all good answers that would lead me to a new recipe, or gadget or better, cleaner way of living my life. All the instructors said that changing your body was 20 percent exercise and 80 percent food. WOW were they right! I started seeing muscles and definition in my arms and legs from only lifting five to eight pound weights. I went from wearing my husbands t-shirts and baggy running pants to buying cute, matching yoga outfits (a reward for meeting each new weight goal).When my copy of The Food Babe Way came in March I was close to reaching my initial goal weight35 lbs less than when I started. I wanted to be the weight I was when I got married and fit into some adorable jeans my husband bought me that I hadnt worn in years (a pair of size 8s I just couldnt bring myself to donate). I decided to order a few more copiesone for my doctor, one for my fitness coach, one for my sister and a few spares for special gifts. Im trying to follow the 21-day plan and do pretty well at it. A few things took me some attempts the lemon/cayenne water didnt stick right away, but I tried again after a week or so and have been on it for nearly two months now. I cant imagine not starting my morning without it.I recently went to a hibachi-style restaurant and didnt read the book before going. I knew the hibachi was out when I asked the cook, Do you have brown rice? And was told, Umm well we have white rice and we put soy sauce on that and it makes it brown. Every question I asked about what they were putting on the meat to the bananas was answered as a joke. I ordered sushi knowing it wasnt that great of an option either. I swore off that restaurant that night. I was saddened to learn our state farmers market doesnt sell organic, so I make treks to Whole Foods and order from online services I read about in the book. I still havent been able to master the 12-hour fast, but Im working on it. Ive read the book twice now and it still travels with me. In fact, I made up several packages of Vanis oatmeal with dates for an upcoming trip. Ive probably recommended the book to more than a dozen people who ask me What are you doing to look like that?Four months after I started this journey Ive lost 42 lbs and am considered by doctors and weight calculators as being at an ideal weight for my height! My husband has never seen me at this weight. I havent been this weight since I was in my early 20s. I want folks to know that I eat too! I eat a lot! My body craves blueberries and asparagus cauliflower lemon risotto, sauted spinach and cabbage, green juice and smoothies, nuts, avocados (I eat one a day!), coconut and organic chicken and fish. Im also asked all the time Dont you reward yourself? I sure do every day! I reward myself with healthy sweets like those pumpkin-spiced nuts or chocolate coconut fat bombs or homemade ice cream. I also reward myself by fitting into size 4 clothes! Clothes are actually fun for me now, not something to hide under.Most importantly Im setting an example for my children of what healthy is and should be. Ive opened up a whole new dialogue with them about what constitutes healthy eating so that were getting the most out of our minds and bodies. I want them to see me as strong, fit and healthy on a daily basis not a picture of what I once was in my early 20s. I believe we lead by example and I need to be an example for them.A few final notes, I kicked butt on my annual fitness test this year. I ran faster than any previous year, did more sit-ups and push-ups than any previous year and had the same waist measurement I did 20 years ago when I was 25. I outran 90 percent of the people I tested with that day  most of them were much younger. In addition, I usually suffer 6-8 weeks with spring pollen allergies (a curse I gained moving to the South)taking a daily pill. This year my allergies have practically disappeared. I only suffered two days! I cant 100% say it is the diet, but I sure think it is. The Food Babe Way changed my lifeand it feels and tastes wonderful!My Top Tips:You must make time for yourself. If you give your time away to everyone else and have nothing left for you at the end of the day then positive life changes, whether losing weight, working out, etc, will be very tough to accomplish.Only you have the power to change your life. Spouse not on-board with the program? Thats ok. You make the decision as to what food goes into your body. If youre not the shopper or the chef, it is harder, but you can purchase for yourself or make requests. You have to want it and not let anyone stop you.Dont be a naysayer. There are so many people Ive encountered that dont believe that organic is better or that pesticides are hurting us. All I know is that I have seen the difference first-hand and I wont let anyone argue with my facts. If you dont believe thats up to you, but dont put it down unless youve tried it.Surround yourself with positive influences! This one is SO IMPORTANT. I could not have done this alone. I had fit, healthy people to encourage me and answer my questions and lift me up. I know my limitations. I know I cannot go to restaurants or drink on a daily or even weekly basis (by the way, I no longer want to), but my positive influencers were all about finding other ways to socialize like PARKfit or making homemade meals. Sure we imbibe from time to timea girls gotta live! But I love them for their company, energy, spirit and supportnot because they come with a cocktail.If you stick with ittruly stick with itthen youll need to go clothes shopping! Dont buy a complete wardrobe the next size down because you may surprise yourself at where your body decides its comfortable. I wanted to wear those size 8 jeans in the worst wayand I did, but only once. Now I need a belt for a few of my size 4s!Good luck with YOUR JOURNEY. I know The Food Babe Way can help you too!

The Shocking Email From Monsanto: Why I am submitting a FOIA request,http://foodbabe.com/2015/09/08/proof-monsanto-pays-public-scientists-discredit-movement-submitting-foia-request/,"Ive always said that food andchemical corporationswork with public university scientists behind closed doors to manipulate the publicand now our movement has irrefutable PROOF. But first, let me start at the beginningWhen our movement got big companies to change, Dr. Kevin Folta, from University of Floridaappeared on the scene. Every time we made headway on an important issue, Kevin Folta, who claimed to be an unbiased scientist, was there to refute our claims and throw some ad hominem attacks. Here are a few examples (many more are documented at the end of this post):The fact that she is able to mobilize this army of blind followers who reject science and follow her words, to smear and harm the reputations of companies that are doing nothing wrong. The Atlantic, 2/11/2015Kevin M. Folta, the chairman of the horticultural sciences department at the University of Florida, described Ms. Haris lecture at the university last October as a corrupt message of bogus science and abject food terrorism.  quoted inNew York Times, 3/15/2015Theres something that dies inside when you are a faculty member that works hard to teach about food, farming and science, and your own university brings in acrackpotto unravel all of the information you have brought to students.  Foltas Blog, Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014My intuition and common sense knew that this guy HAD to be connected to these corporations in some way, but he kept denying any connection. And I believed he was causing irreparable harm to our healthy food movement because the media believed that he was an unbiased scientist.Well, NOT ANYMORE.This weekan unprecedented major investigative report was published in the NY Times about how the chemical and food industries work with public university scientists to advance their agendas to the public. Hundreds of emails have now been revealedbetween University of Florida Professor Dr. Kevin Folta, Monsanto, the biotech front groups, and their PR firm Ketchum after a FOIA (Freedom of Information Act) request was submitted by the nonprofit group U.S. Right To Know.Why would Monsantowork with a public scientist in the first place?Some powerful entities in the chemical and food industries have a financial incentive to try to discredit us in the work we have all done together and now we know how they are using public scientists like Dr. Kevin Folta as sock puppets to advance their message. Weve come a long way in our food movement and things are finally starting to change  people are getting healthier and the food industry is responding to us, but why is someone likeDr. Kevin Folta on a mission to stop our progress?Newly discovered emailsreveal that Folta received a $25,000 unrestricted grant from Monsanto, and even wrote to a Monsanto executive,Im glad to sign on to whatever you like, or write whatever you like,and I promise a solid return on investment.However, Folta previously denied ties to Monsanto, here are 9 different examples:But he denies financial ties.He has no formal connection to Monsanto.David [Oppenheimer] and I have no research or personal funding from Big Ag  only in our dreams.Certainly Monsanto (and others) have funded work at my university. Not my work.I have no financial ties to any of the BigAg companies that make transgenic crops, including Monsanto.I have nothing to do wth MONIm an independent scientist. Not Monsanto.I am one of thousands of independent, public scientists worldwideI have nothing to do with Monsanto. Im not, you know, I dont work for them I am not a shill (laughing) Im a public scientist.Not only was Folta repeatedly dishonest about his ties to Monsanto, but on several occasions according to the NY Times, Folta took word for word answers and commentary from Monsantos PR firm Ketchum to use as his own words. Previously heclaimedhe never used the text written for himby the PR firm Ketchum.Monsanto sells Roundup, the chemical that is sprayed on the majority of GMO seeds. The main ingredient in Roundup was recently classified as a probable carcinogen. They are in panic mode trying to repair their image and will do anything to confuse the public.Folta attempted to derail my speaking event at the University of Florida. He has also beeninterviewed by major media outlets such asThe Atlantic, NPR, and the NY Times acting as an unbiased third party source, telling reporters he has no financial ties to Monsanto or the biotech industry all while acting as the ringleader and chief of my critics.Monsanto thanks Folta for attending my talk at The University of FloridaOne of the emails discovered by USRTK.org showed Lisa Drake, an executiveat Monsanto cheering Dr. Folta on after he attended my talk at his University last fall. Dr. Folta wrote a blog post attempting to discredit my talk including a false accusation that I refused to answer questions from the audience. (FYI Heres the photographic evidence of the long line of teachers and students that I answered questions from.) I still find it bizarre that if he wanted to ask me a question so bad that he didnt stay to meet me face to face. Instead he spread dishonest information about my talk all over social media, in forums and on his blog, acting more like an online troll than a distinguished science professor.Seeing this email sent shivers down my spine and left me with a lot of questions. First and foremost, my talk was not about the dangers of GMO foods, it was about the story of quitting my corporate career to become a food activist sharing examples of major food companies changing their policies. Who wrote thatparagraph summarizing my talk that Lisa Drake referenced? Why was a Monsanto executive sending this messageto Folta? Did they ask him to attend my talk? Are they paying him to attack activists like myself? At the time I had no idea why this professor wasso aggressive towards me but now its starting to make sense. Ive tried to explain to various reporters in the past that many of our critics are part of the larger entrenched food and chemical lobby that doesntagree withhaving more transparency (labeling GMOs) or doesntwant toremove thecontroversial chemical additives from our food. The reporters have always said but what about the public university scientists that have no ties?This investigation finally begins to explain that.Why I am also submitting a FOIA requestIn light of this email and the incredible amount of reputationaldamage Dr. Folta has waged on me personally and our healthy food movement (see a sampling of his public comments below), I am submitting a formal request to the University of Florida to have all documents and correspondence released to the public from Dr. Kevin Folta regarding my name Vani Hari and Food Babe.I believe obtaining these correspondences will serve the public in greater transparency on how the food industry usesindependent third-party scientists and professors to control science and deliver their PR and lobbying messaging.Ive often wondered why companies like Monsanto go through such great lengths to stop transparency about GMOs If their food is safe, why dont they want to label GMOs? Why would they pay public university scientiststo advance their message?Xo,VaniQuotesfrom Kevin Folta:Folta calls me a crackpot, accuses me of food terrorism, blackmail, villifying farmers and compares me to a dog.Vani is very good at marketing herself and telling people what they want to hear.She is very good at playing into the current popularity of vilifying farmers and large-scale agriculture. But really, shes her own company, and shes the spokesperson. The Atlantic, 2/11/2015Kevin M. Folta, the chairman of the horticultural sciences department at the University of Florida, described Ms. Haris lecture at the university last October as a corrupt message of bogus science and abject food terrorism. (Her fee was $6,000.) Dr. Folta added, She found that a popular social media site was more powerful than science itself, more powerful than reason, more powerful than actually knowing what youre talking about..  quoted inNew York Times, 3/15/2015She really conflates the science.If anything, shes created more confusion about food, more confusion about the role of chemicals and additives. NPR, 12/4/2014To have someone like Hari go out and make up nonsense that only digs into public opinion against these technologies is really frustrating for us. The Atlantic, 2/11/2015Thats not healthy activism or change based on science. Thats coercion, fear mongering and (yes) terrorism to achieve short-sighted political non-victories in the name of profit and self-promotion, ironically the same thing she accuses the companies of.Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014Luckily, Starbucks didnt foldOtherwise, Hari would have blackmailed them too. Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014Vani Hari would be spreading her corrupt message of bogus science and abject food terrorism here at the University of Florida. Oh joy. Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014Responding to the Food Babe is like telling a funny joke to my dog at a party. Everyone there gets it except for the dog. She just tilts her head to one side and looks at me like Im stupid. Response to the Food Babe. This is Boring, 3/19/2015Theres something that dies inside when you are a faculty member that works hard to teach about food, farming and science, and your own university brings in a crackpot to unravel all of the information you have brought to students. Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014If this is a charismatic leader of a new food movement it is quite a disaster. Shes uninformed, uneducated, trite and illogical. Shes afraid of science and intellectual engagement. Shes Oz candy at best.-Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014What if Hari were to take a long look in the mirror and decide that while scaring people into boycotts and book buying pays the bills, the legacy associated with it is embarrassing. Time will frown on Hari, and it already is happening. While adored by internet fans, scientists, physicians, the food industry, farmers and science fans see her clearly as the empty information vessel she truly is. The Value of Vani, 12/12/2014Her discussion was a narcissistic, self-appointed attack on food science and human nutrition. There is a vein in my head that pulses when I hear someone deliberately misrepresent science for personal celebrity, and it was pounding.Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014I was really proud to see that the student audience was not buying it. Throughout her presentation that was about Hari in the spotlight and me-me-me, students got up and left. She left gaping pregnant pauses where previous performances got applause only to hear nothing. Not even crickets. Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014While microphones stood ready in the audience to answer questions, there was no public Q&A period where a scientist that knows the research could publicly challenge her false assertions.-Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014I guess Im just angry because I didnt get to lock science horns with The Food Babe. I would have liked to have asked a few questions that she could never answer. Food Babe Visits My University, 10/21/2014I listened to her talk about herself and provide lots of false information to my students, and waited for the opportunity to ask dismantling questions from one of the two microphones in the room. A Letter To Support My Claims Against the Food Babe, 11/16/2014She did not take questions from the audience. The event ended and the audience left.-A Letter To Support My Claims Against the Food Babe, 11/16/2014She was paid $6000 for over an hours time to promote her brand and spread her filth. Now scientists and educators have to fix it. A Letter To Support My Claims Against the Food Babe, 11/16/2014As we attempt to illuminate products, technology and method to feed a growing population, Haris shameful resistance to reality needs to be met. Weve done that, and Im proud of the push back The Value of Vani, 12/12/2014Recently Ive given a number of talks and interviews where Ive been described as the guy that stood up to the Food Babe. While standing up for science is important, Id rather be described as the guy that changed her mind because I took the time to teach the facts. The Value of Vani, 12/12/2014I cannot think of someone so clueless that thinks shes so clue-full. The bravado to manufacture completely wacky statements is beyond arrogance, and to criticize students who approach her from a scholarly evidence-based point shows shes fully subscribed to her own deception. Vani Haris Kooky Response to CriticalStudents, 1/26/2015Folta discreditsFood Babe campaigns to remove controversial chemicals from the food supply:Bread is a foam. Even culinary experts will tell you.It was a perfectly safe food additive for years, until she came along and decided that Subway bread was essentially a yoga mat. The Atlantic, 2/11/2015The fact that she is able to mobilize this army of blind followers who reject science and follow her words, to smear and harm the reputations of companies that are doing nothing wrong. The Atlantic, 2/11/2015Safety always has to be the number one concern. And an understanding of safety is contingent on an understanding of the chemical in question. But she lacks the scientific prowess to be able to tell when something is truly a threat, and when something poses no threat. The Atlantic, 2/11/2015Additional Evidence: Folta deniesanyties to Monsanto on his blog:In another thread she encourages those curious to call the university, because a certain professor who promotes Monsanto has spread a lot of nonsense. Again, she speaks from no evidence, leveling false allegations against a public scientist that only wants her to back her claims with science. How do I support Monsanto?-A Letter To Support My Claims Against the Food Babe, 11/16/2014She also took the liberty of making a false association between a public scientist and university professor to a company that does not exist, purely to discredit him.Here are two clear falsehoods that Hari stands by. Why anyone would take any advice from her, ever, is beyond me.-A Letter To Support My Claims Against the Food Babe, 11/16/2014Of course, she ties me in with Monsanto. Blatantly false. But since when does she need evidence before making a claim? Vani Hari (Food Babe) and Silencing Critics, 12/7/2014Foltas personal email to Food Babe (3/19/2015): I work as an independent, public scientist. Companies have no control of my research, my results or my opinions.Youll also see from my publications that almost all of my funding comes from public sources, like USDA, NSF and NIH. Im not a Monsanto scientist as youve suggested. My only industry funding is for strawberries a strawberry industry of family farmers that grow a nutritious fruit. Yes, I answer questions on GMO Answers. I am not paid, Im grateful for the forum, and if you gave me a page on Food Babe.com to answer questions the answers would be exactly the same.26.9K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

I Can’t Believe I Used To Beg My Mom To Put These In My Lunch Box,http://foodbabe.com/2015/05/28/i-cant-believe-i-used-to-beg-my-mom-to-put-these-in-my-lunch-box/,"When I was little, we had a Kmart really close by my house. Every time we would visit, I would beg my mom for Little Debbie Snacks for my lunchbox. Those boxes of deliciousness (and now grossness) lined the end cap of the aisle so nicely by checkout, we just couldnt miss them when we walked by. Little did I know at the time, that I was eating one of the most controversial preservatives ever invented. Youve probably heard all about this ingredient in cosmetics, shampoos, lotions, toothpastes and deodorants, but may not realize that youcould be eating it too.This endocrine-disrupting preservative has been found in the urine of over 90% of Americans, so nearly all of us are being exposedto it from a variety of sources  and theres absolutely no reason we should be eating it!The Culprit: ParabensParabens are added to someprocessed foods as a preservative. Youll find it mostly in cheap baked goods like muffins, cakes and tortillas. But, its also added tosome seemingly healthy products like trail mixes.The problem with parabensThe scientists at the Environmental Working Group (EWG) recently came out with their Dirty Dozen Guide to Food Additives and propyl paraben makes their list as one of the most hazardous ingredients in our food. Their guide lists the 12 worst offenders in the ingredient world that are associated with serious health concerns and which the FDA has failed to take serious action on.Parabens have been researched extensively and found to be endocrine-disrupting chemicals that are linked to breast cancer (sources: 1, 2, 3, 4), andreproductive problems(sources: 1, 2,3). Parabens act as a weak synthetic estrogen,and endocrine-disruptors like these arebelieved to be a contributing factor in the increasing incidents of early puberty in young girls. According to a report in the New York Times:Of particular concern are endocrine-disruptors, like xeno-estrogens or estrogen mimics. These compounds behave like steroid hormones and can alter puberty timing. For obvious ethical reasons, scientists cannot perform controlled studies proving the direct impact of these chemicals on children, so researchers instead look for so-called natural experiments, one of which occurred in 1973 in Michigan, when cattle were accidentally fed grain contaminated with an estrogen-mimicking chemical, the flame retardant PBB. The daughters born to the pregnant women who ate the PBB-laced meat and drank the PBB-laced milk started menstruating significantly earlier than their peers.Althoughparabens are generally believed to beexcreted fromthe bodywithin hours after exposure, thesehealth effects are being attributed torecurrent exposures that take place over time. As wererepeatedly exposed to parabens in our environment and food, this is a real hazard.Parabens can be in your food even if its not on the label.This is because parabensare sometimes naturally occurring in food (such as blueberries and vanilla) and can also appear in food packaging, contaminating its contents.Researchers recently tested food products froma grocery store in New York and found parabens in 90% of awide variety of foods: drinks,dairy products, oils, fish, grains, meat, fruit, vegetables  so they are everywhere! This means that we cant completely avoid parabens, but we can do our best to minimize our exposure. Eliminating themas a food additive is an easy way to start.What To Look Out For In The Grocery Store:When parabens are added as an additive, theyare fairly easy to spot on an ingredient list, as long as you know what to look for. There are a fewdifferent types approved to be added tofood, and this is how you might see them listed on the ingredient label:Propyl Paraben or PropylparabenMethylparabenSometimes listed as Methyl and Propyl Parabens or Methyl-Propyl ParabenHeptylparaben  This paraben additive is permitted in beer & wine,but unless they agree to list their ingredients well never know if its used.Artificial Flavoror Artificial Flavoring The FDA allows parabens in synthetic food flavorings.Ethylparaben  not commonly used in foodButylparaben  not commonly used in foodBesides checking out the ingredient list,its always a good idea to consider the packaging that is being used in any packaged food, becausethese chemicals may leach into the food. This is yet another goodreason to ditch processed food and head straight to the farmers market!Food Brands Guilty of Using ParabenAdditives:Last month, theEWG launched a campaign, demanding that U.S.companies remove parabens from their food after their Food Scores database found parabens in49 widely-available processed foods. Cheap processed foods are the biggest offenders big surprise! Heres just a few popular brands that have beenknown to use paraben ingredients according to EWGs database:Little DebbieWeight WatchersSara LeeLa Banderita TortillasEmeraldBreakfastPrivate SelectionCafe ValleyArcher FarmsArizona Snack CompanyMrs. Fields(addsparabenstosome frosted cookies)A major place that you mayfind paraben additives is in your local grocery stores private-label bakery section. Ask the bakery department if they will let you read the ingredients in their special-order cakes before you ever order anything. I dont believe in deprivation, and I know there are times in our lives when we just need to eat cake! Instead of picking up a chemical additive laden supermarket cake, try out my fantastic pound cake recipe with homemade chocolate frosting. If you want more help avoiding processed foods with synthetic preservatives, youve got to check out theFood Babe membership program. Youll get exclusive weekly tips, a new monthly meal calendar with recipes, grocery lists and the support of the Food Babe team. Hope youll consider joining us!Dont Be Fooled By The NaysayersSome people who have a vested interest in continuing the use of these synthetic chemicals like to say,Vanilla naturally contains parabens! Your recipes contains parabens!. It is true that parabens occur naturally in foods like blueberriesand carrots, but does that mean we shouldstop eating these healthy foods? Absolutely not!As over 90% of us have been shown to have parabens in our urine, we are being over-exposed to parabens, and its not because we are eating too many vegetables. Theres no reason for food manufacturers to continue the use of synthetic paraben additives as preservatives in food. As stated in the postabove parabens are everywhere  so we should do our best to limit our exposure by choosing foods (and beauty products) without these additives. Propylparaben is on EWGslist of food additivesto avoidfor a reason. The use of synthetic parabens as an additiveis irresponsible and should be stopped.Please spread the wordDo you know someone who isnt reading ingredient lists or is still buying brands like Little Debbie Snacks? If so, please share this post with them!The real food movement is spreading like wildfire because of your sharing, so thank you!Xo,Vani31.7K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

Shocking: Why Are Doctors Recommending This Toxic Drink?,http://foodbabe.com/2014/05/13/shocking-why-are-doctors-recommending-this-toxic-drink/,"I have been receiving emails from the #FoodBabeArmy about an alarming practice that happens at doctors offices around the country that needs to stop today.First, however, I was thrilled by the news last week that Coke and Pepsi both announced that theyre (finally) removing Brominated Vegetable Oil (BVO) from their products  which includes Mountain Dew and Powerade. Of course these products are still no good for your body, as they are loaded with sugar or artificial sweeteners, preservatives, phosphates, and artificial colors.Once consumers find out about these questionable ingredients, food companies have nowhere left to hide, but some remain in denial, Ill get to that in a minute.This is a great win for my friendSarah Kavanagh, an amazing teen food activist(seen below)who started the initial Change.org petition, and also for the #FoodBabeArmy because BVO is one of the most harmful ingredients that is still being used in the U.S., even though its banned in Europe and Japan. Its patented for use as aflame retardant!Its banned for good reason.According to food chemist, Walter Vetter, PhD, BVO can build up in the body and cause toxic effects. Most shockingly, there is a published report of a man who had to undergo dialysis after regularly consuming large amounts of Ruby Red Squirt containing BVO. There is another report here indicating that soda with BVO caused the same condition, deteriorating a man to the point that he couldnt even walk. Of course, these people were drinking an insane amount of soda (up to 8 liters a day), and the cumulative effects on your body when you consume fewer BVO-containing drinks is largely unknown because the research is scarce. Charles Vorhees, a toxicologist at Cincinnati Childrens Hospital Medical Center agrees by saying, Compounds like these that are in widespread use probably should be reexamined periodically with newer technologies to ensure that there arent effects that would have been missed by prior methodsI think BVO is the kind of compound that probably warrants some reexamination.Out of the research that has been done, it has been shown that BVO accumulates in your body and is linked to heart lesions. As reported in Scientific American, After a few extreme soda bingesnot too far from what many gamers regularly consumea few patients have needed medical attention for skin lesions, memory loss and nerve disorders, all symptoms of overexposure to bromine. Given this evidence pointing to the dangers of BVO consumption, can you believe that it has taken SO LONG for Coke and Pepsi to finally remove it from their products? There really is no excuse. Way back in the 1970s, the FDA began to question the safety of BVO and put the ingredient on interim status, which meant that food companies could use it in products until toxicology research was done. Well  guess what? Those studies have not been done in the last 40 years, so it has remained in our food  and the FDA has done nothing about it. With the FDA asleep at the wheel, you will still find BVO legally in these drinks by the Dr. Pepper Snapple Group:SquirtDiet SquirtRuby Red SquirtDiet Ruby Red SquirtSunkist Fruit Punch SodaSunkist Peach SodaCrush Orange SodaCrush Peach SodaCrush Pineapple SodaPeafiel Grapefruit SodaPeafiel Mandarin SodaSun Drop Citrus SodaDiet Sun Drop Citrus SodaSun Drop Cherry Lemon SodaStewarts Orange n Cream SodaDiet Stewarts Orange n Cream SodaStewarts Key Lime SodaI found it incredibly disturbing that some of these sodas comply with school beverage guidelines and are being served nationwide in our schools. A member of my team contacted Dr. Pepper Snapple Group and was told they have no plans to remove BVO from any of these drinks because its FDA approved and has been diligently researched. At least we know the truth and will avoid these drinks at all costs.Also, many store brand citrus sodas still contain brominated oil, so watch out for those too.And we arent done yet.There is one place where BVO is lurking that is reprehensible  and I knew that I needed to bring light to it. A drink containing BVO is being prescribed by doctors to pregnant women everywhere when they get tested for gestational diabetes  a routine test given to nearly all pregnant women in the U.S. Check out the ingredients for the Oral Glucose Tolerance Beverage by AeroMed:These drinks (also known as Glucola) are essentially sugar water with hazardous artificial colors and preservatives with a VERY LONG shelf life. They are no better than most sodas on the market  and truly not something youd want to consume while pregnant. Yet, doctors routinely prescribe this non-carbonated soda to their pregnant patients, without taking into consideration the dangerous ingredients they contain. While its certainly important to monitor your blood glucose during pregnancy, there are alternatives to drinking this toxic sugar water.Realize you have a choice  Simply ask your doctor what other options you have and if they dont know, educate them!The purpose of the drink is to ingest 50 to 100 grams of glucose, after which your doctor can test how your body handles influx of sugar.This woman was given the alternative of eating real food, such as bananas.This study showed that eating 28 jelly beans had the same effect on blood sugar in a 50 gram glucose test. Of course, youd want to choose a non-gmo variety, free of artificial colors and other nasties! An even better option that you can discuss with your doctor would be to avoid the test altogether and monitor your blood sugar with a glucometer throughout your pregnancy, as recommended here, here and here. This is the best alternative because you wont create an extreme blood sugar spike, and can stick to your regular healthy diet. You will also avoid feeling like you are going to vomit and the dreaded crash and burn that women report after drinking glucola  including several Food Babe readers who have reached out to me personally.As you can see, there is absolutely no reason that you need to consume these toxic glucola drinks. Now that you are informed, you can make a better choice for yourself and your baby.Remember, I am not a doctor (take my advice at your own risk), however, in my opinion there is no way in hell any doctor could convince me to drink something with flame retardant, artificial dyes made from petroleum, controversial preservatives and GMOs, pregnant or not!If you know someone who is pregnant or is still drinking BVO, please share this critical information with them and let them know they have a choice!Wishing you the greatest health imaginable.Xo,Vani372K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

Jason’s Deli: What’s Healthy & What’s Not,http://foodbabe.com/2013/04/23/jasons-deli-whats-healthy-whats-not/,"Jasons Deli is one of the places my family loves to eat. When I would come home from college to visit, we would go there all the time. Wed have sandwiches, soup, salad, those little free mini corn and gingerbread muffins and free ice cream at the end of every visit. The prices were economical which suited my Dads frugality and the location was super convenient. But as soon as I started figuring out what was in restaurant food, my trips to Jasons Deli stopped. I didnt really have a specific reason other than the fact that home prepared meals tasted better and made me feel great  much better than the days I would go out to eat.Jasons Deli is a very popular choice for a lot of people out there, not just my family, so I thought it would be crucial to investigate their food. Besides, many of you have asked for this specific investigation on facebook for quite some time now so with no further delay, heres what I found out.  On paper Jasons Deli appears to have your health in their best interest. Jasons Deli was the first major restaurant chain to eliminate transfat and high fructose corn syrup. They recently claimed to have eliminated MSG too (we will address that later) and1/5 of Jasons Deli menu is organic  an absolutely staggering statistic considering the size of the menu. They also do not use any artificial colors  another amazing feat considering all the restaurants that still do.So this begs the question  What other ingredients should you watch out for at Jasons Deli? What should you still be concerned about? And whats REAL FOOD and whats not?Trying not to be overly exhaustive, I requested the ingredients of a sampling of some of the most popular items on Jasons Delis menu. Requesting the ingredients was easy compared to some of the investigations I have done in the past. There are a couple of ways you can get your hands on the ingredients. You can call the headquarters and request them, email them or ask in the store. If you ask for the ingredients in the store, it is a quite laborsome for the employees as they have to dig for the packages to show you the ingredients on actual boxes. Unfortunately, they do not have a list in a neatly organized binder. During the several requests I made using all of these methods, Jasons Deli employees (in the stores and at the headquarters) were amazingly cooperative and made sure I got all the answers I was looking for  a huge win in my book. However, posting their ingredients online for everyone to see would be an even bigger win in transparency, especially considering their tag line We are all about healthy food. Until then, Ive posted the ingredients that I inquired about below, so this can serve as your online guide until they do. (please note: the ingredients highlighted in red are either potential genetically engineered or GMO ingredients, harmful additives or preservatives  in other words, things no one should willingly want to eat.)***Update: After releasing this investigation,Jasons Deli posted all ingredients onlinewith an Interactive Nutrition Menu a huge win in transparency!***Jasons Deli Ingredients(Sampling of Menu Items)Artesian 9-grain Bread The first ingredient is refined white flour  (you can tell when you see that vitamins and minerals are added back into the flour and the word whole is missing from the front of the word wheat). Refined white flour is basically empty calories with zero nutrition, but thankfully they add in a bunch of other whole grains to round out the bread.Whole Grain Bread  Has several questionable ingredients added to it  GMOs in the form of soybean oil, soy lecithin, dextrose etc., caramel powder (which is just a powdered form of caramel color that is considered a carcinogen), and preservatives, along with questionable natural flavorsthat trick your brain into enjoying a processed product like this more than you should.Croissant This bread definitely doesnt come from France considering all the preservatives and dough conditioners it contains, especially the ingredient azodicarbonamide which is banned in Europe and if you get caught using it in Singapore you are fined $450,000 dollars  the substance is linked to asthma and allergies.Organic Wheat Wrap  Definitely the best choice on the bread menu.Wild Sockeye Salmon  Any restaurant serving wild salmon over farmed salmon deserves praise, but the additives used here are dreadful. Several ingredients are genetically engineered and spice extractives can be a hidden form of MSG.Ham  Carrageenan is the most concerning ingredient here, first of all whats a seaweed by-product even doing in ham? I found out it is used as a gelling agent that mimics fat that you would normally find in meat. For low fat meat products, manufacturers add it to improve texture. Carrageenanwhen ingested can start to degrade in the gastrointestinal tract and in the liver and turn into a carcinogen, resulting in a serious inflammatory agent that also can cause intestinal abnormalities.All Natural Chicken Breast  One thing I would like to mention here is that just because a meat is labeled natural doesnt mean its free from GMOs. By the looks of the ingredients here, this would be the best meat option to get, however you have to realize the chickens were likely fed GMO corn and soy  not the healthiest diet. Personally I would avoid meat all together and go vegetarian for this reason.Roast Beef, Chicken Salad I would avoid both of these choices  there are GMOs, hidden MSG (hydrolyzed soy protein, hydrolyzed corn gluten, and/or autolyzed yeast extract) and caramel color. Whats so bad about caramel color, you ask? Its not thetype of caramel you make at home by cooking sugar. This caramel color is manufactured by heating ammonia and sulfites under high pressure, which creates carcinogenic compoundsproven to causeliver tumors, lung tumors, and thyroid tumorsin rats and mice.Chili, Southwest Chicken Chili, Organic Vegetable SoupThis is where Jasons Deli really messes up. And it wouldnt be a stretch to say their No MSG message in their marketing is a total lie if you read between the lines. As you have noticed above, there is hidden MSG in several different meat products, as well as all of their soups  including the organic vegetable soup in the form of autolyzed yeast paste. The amount of MSG that restaurants can put in your food isnot regulatedand having a No MSG label is extremely misleading if they replace MSG with other forms that cause the same health issues.MSG is an excitotoxin that if given in large enough doses canexcite brain cells to death.MSGcan cause adverse reactions in some people including skin rashes, itching, hives, nausea, vomiting, migraine headaches, asthma, heart irregularities, depression and even seizures. Additionally,MSG is an ingredient added to different recipes so your brain remembers a taste combined with the smell of a food. Food scientists use it to create addiction. Bottom line, it doesnt belong in food considering the obesity crisis in this country.Homemade Ranch  Looking at the ingredients above, you can see that calling this dressing homemade is a complete joke. I dont have maltodextrin or carrageenan sitting around in my pantry, do you?Organic Balsamic  The best option for dressingOrganic French Dressing Another good option, but not a fan of natural flavoring as mentioned above.Mac & Cheese Light years ahead of Kraft Mac & Cheese, but still concerning since the cheese used is not guaranteed to be hormone and antibiotic free.Guacamole  Clean of additives. I would use this as a salad dressing.Organic Corn Chips  I found out they use Garden of Eatin brand chips, which are GMO free. The only issue I have with these is that they use canola oil, which is not a healthy oil.Over-consumption of oils like canola are causing an abundance of Omega 6 fatty acids in our diets. The imbalance of Omega 6 fatty acids increases the risk of inflammation, heart disease, obesity, andprostate and bone cancer.Pickle  This was a huge bummer. I was excited there were no artificial colors but bummed that the pickles contain sodium benzoate, one of the absolute worst preservatives out there.The Mayo Clinic reported that this preservativeincreases hyperactivityin children. Also, when sodium benzoate combines with ascorbic acid (vitamin C), it can formbenzene, acarcinogen that damages DNA in cells and accelerates aging.Chocolate Chip Cookie & Fudge Brownie (see picture below)  Both of these baked sweets have propylene glycol, the same ingredient that you winterize cars with  antifreeze, and the same ingredient that lubricates condoms. This is definitely not an ingredient I want to end my meal with!Ice Cream  Besides the carrageenan already discussed above, artificial vanilla flavor is manufactured in a factory without using any real vanilla beans, instead it is a by-product of the wood pulp industry. Polysorbate 80, which is in both flavors, is linkedtoinfertility in mice, an increased riskof blood clots, stroke, heart attack, heart failure, and tumor growth or recurrence in patients with certain types of cancer. Anarticlepublished about polysorbate 80 found that the agent could cause pregnant woman to go into anaphylactic shock and isharmful to patients with Crohns disease.Lastly, the milk products used are not hormone or antibiotic free, this should be enough reason to leave Jasons Deli without eating the free ice cream.Given all this information, the obvious question now isWHAT WOULD I GET AT JASONS DELI?Straight off the menu, I would feel pretty good about ordering the Nutty Mixed Up Salad (likely without the chicken)and Spinach Veggie Wrap. Also I would excitingly order all the organic vegetables currently available (which are: spinach, mixed greens, apples, carrots and peas) at the salad bar and top it off with a huge side of guacamole and hummus. Id also get the steamed veggies if I were feeling like I wanted something warm to eat. (Note the zucchini that is offered in the steamed veggies may be GMO since it is not organic.)For the kids in your life (if ordering off the kids menu), Id go with the Organic Peanut Butter & Jelly or the Organic Grilled Cheese but with organic whole wheat wrap or 9 grain artisanal wheat bread vs. the whole wheat bread that has additives (as discussed above). Organic carrots and organic apples on the side are a wonderful accompaniment too!I know I stopped going to Jasons Deli a while back but given the opportunity to dine there again, I wouldnt think twice. Its a no brainer  Jasons Deli blows away the competition when it comes to quick, easy and organic meals without having to visit a grocery store.If you think this post can help someone make the right decision the next time they visit Jasons Deli  please share it with them. I want this information to be out there helping as many people as possible who would not otherwise know or understand the ingredients they are eating.Thank you in advance for spreading the word.XOXO,Food Babe5/1 Update: Just received the ingredients in the famous free mini muffins at the salad barI would stay far, far away!86.3K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

Is Your Protein Shake Safe?,http://foodbabe.com/2012/12/13/is-your-protein-shake-safe/,"Protein shakes, powders, and supplements are incredibly popular with the health conscious crowd. Considering what typical protein shakes promise  sleek muscles, weight loss and a quick, easy healthy meal replacement  its logical to see why, but is your protein shake safe? Unfortunately, the food industry is making an absolute killing (maybe literally) selling ones that are filled with highly processed denatured proteins, chemicals, preservatives and other additives. Theres one thing in common for all of them  they are all processed and deciding on whether or not they are actually real food comes into question. Now not all processed things we put in our body are technically bad for us  but understanding what exactly is in your protein shake is critical to deciding whether to consume it, select an alternative, or discontinue use all together.GET INFORMEDWeve discussed GMOs here, Artificial Colors here, Natural Flavors here, Carrageenan here, Antibiotics here, and Hormones here before so I wont go into them again in detail specifically. Regardless, you should know consuming a protein drink with any of those ingredients is a risk to your health.NOT CERTIFIED ORGANICMost protein powders on the market are not certified organic, nor are they Non-GMO Project Verified. That means all of them might contain GMOs and most definitely contain pesticides that are considered harmful and potentially toxic with long-term exposure. This increased exposure is linked to birth defects, nerve damage, and even cancer. The Presidents Cancer Panel has urged us not to consume food sprayed with pesticides and doesnt believe any amount is safe. Because of this reason, I cant imagine willingly wanting to spend a serious chunk of change (protein shakes are expensive!) to buy any of these listed products as a way to help build muscle, lose weight or replace a meal.IS YOUR PROTEIN DRINK SAFE? Hmmm NOT WITH THESE INGREDIENTS:Heavy Metals Consumer Reports conducted an eye-opening investigation that revealed several protein powders contain heavy metals  specifically arsenic, cadmium, and lead. EAS Myoplex tested for two heavy metals in higher amounts than the USP limit of exposure per day. Muscle Milk had the highest of all levels of all brands tested.Heres an excerpt taken from the Consumer Reports investigation on Protein Powders:Cadmium raises special concern because it accumulates in and can damage the kidneys, the same organs that can be damaged by excessive protein consumption. And it can take 20 years for the body to eliminate even half the cadmium absorbed today. This is a highly toxic metal, and while there are some cases where decisions have to be weighed against relative risks, accepting that you have to be exposed to any cadmium at all in your protein drink after your workout is definitely not one of them, says Michael Harbut, M.D., director of the Environmental Cancer Initiative at the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Royal Oak, Mich. When these toxic heavy metals are combined in a product that is marketed for daily use, that raises serious public health concerns, especially for pregnant women, children, and young adults, says Burns, who has been a toxicology consultant to state and federal government agencies.Soy ProteinMany protein drinks use soy protein concentrate or soy protein isolate in conjunction with other proteins. Over 90% of the soy produced in this country is GMO and contaminated with Roundup herbicide, but thats not the only reason to avoid soy protein. When soy is looked at from a macronutrient perspective, it can give the illusion of a very healthy food  full of plant based protein, essential amino acids and fiber. However, the soy that is grown and produced today is largely hybridized, making the amino acids largely indigestible leading to digestive issues that have caused many people to be allergic to soy. Whats worse is when soy is isolated to just its protein state, it becomes severely denatured and can cause hormonal disruptions because of the excessive amount of estrogen contained in it. Soy also has an abundance of phytic acid that leaches calcium and other vital minerals from your body.Maltodextrin & FibersolCalling out an ingredient filler like maltodextrin may make you think Im being nitpicky  but is this carb substitute that is likely derived from genetically modified corn really necessary in protein powders? Maltodextrin can be used to make the substance fibersol. This is made by heating maltodextrin at very high temperatures and treating it with enzymes and acids to make a fiber your body simply cant digest and makes you feel artificially full. If you are eating enough plant-based foods, there is no reason to supplement with this type of chemically derived fiber. Fibersol is just another additive that does absolutely nothing for your long term health. Why not add a real food like spinach or a banana to your smoothie instead?Acesulfame Potassium or Acesulfame KThis is the most common form of artificial sweetener available in protein drinks (and tons of other processed foods) today and according the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) it is anything but safe. CSPI reported thesafety tests of acesulfame-K that were conducted in the 1970s were inadequate. Specifically, two rat studies suggest that the additivemight cause cancer, but these studies were never addressed by the FDA before they approved the substance to also be used unregulated in soft drinks. In addition it is mentioned that large doses of acetoacetamide (a breakdown product of this sugar) have been shown to affect the thyroid in rats, rabbits, and dogs.Whey Protein IsolateWhey protein isolate is highly processed, unlike whole protein food concentrate.Most whey protein isolates start from ultra-pasteurized conventional milk that has antibiotics and growth hormones and are then exposed to acid processing, stripping alkalinizing minerals, naturally occurring vitamins and lipids. This processing makes whey protein isolate over acidifying in the body. Chronically consuming whey protein isolate without appropriate balance of alkalizing foods, can acidify your body and over time increase your vulnerability to degenerative disease. This overly processed form of whey can be found in a lot of popular protein drinks.Luckily, you dont have to rely on protein drinks because simply eating a variety of real food alone gives you plenty of protein.But, if you are still concerned about protein you could make a protein-filled real food smoothie like this or choose from any of these real food sources of protein below:Meat sources of protein  beef, pork, poultry, eggs, yogurt, cheese, fish (very important to choose organic if you go this route) Vegetarian sources of protein  legumes (dry beans, lentils, and peas), nuts and seeds (almond butter, sunflower seeds, hemp seeds), whole grains (oatmeal, quinoa, brown rice, pasta),dark leafy vegetables, and some fruits like avocadoSO ARE THERE ANY HEALTHY PROTEIN POWDERS?Fortunately, there are a few Food Babe approved protein powders, including Organic Plant Protein Superfood 30 ShakeTeras Organic Whey, Nutivas Hemp Protein that do not contain any of the ingredients mentioned here, and would fall under the definition of real food in my book. If you decide to supplement your protein, it is very important to double and triple check the ingredient list and check with the manufacturer to see how they process their protein.If you know someone using a questionable protein powder, please share this post with them  I know they will be grateful to know the truth, considering how much some of these types of supplements cost!Xo,VaniUpdated 8/2016: Additional research on protein powders added andremoved outdated information.759K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

Another Fabulous Vegan Potluck…,http://foodbabe.com/2012/01/18/another-fabulous-vegan-potluck/,"Good Evening!I broke Habit #3 last night  but for good reason.I started the day with Habit #1 and Habit #4 (do you know these habits by heart yet?) I also had some protein powder mixed with chia seeds after a quick 3 mile run.I practiced another Habit #4 with a Hari Shake before lunch.I followed the shake about an hour later with a salad at my desk. I dont really like eating at my desk, but you gotta do what you gotta do especially when there are back to back meetings you have no control over.I have complete and utter control over what I put in my mouth, though. I stuffed it full ofquinoa, arugula, tahini, red peppers, carrots, red onion and raisins, a few buckwheat crackers with almond butter too. Oh and I had a few Marys Gone Sticks & Twigs  Have you tried them yet?  they are so great when you are feeling all snacky snacky and want something crunchy crunchy!After work I did a quick 45 mins of yoga at home  I needed to decompress from sitting all day long. I did a few hand stands during my sequence Ive been feeling rather dizzy at random times during the day since I started practicing them hopefully this will subside with time. Any yogis out there experience this?Last night, I spoke at Three Weeks to Wellness and was invited to another amazing vegan potluck before my talk I made lots of Forever Cookies with cherries to share with all the cleansers just like last time.I was kinda mad at myself  because I didnt write down directions to the new gathering spot and I was late. I missed all the yummy food explanations (my favorite part), so I honestly dont really know what I ate for dinner. My plate looked like this and everything tasted fantastic.At the cleanse, I got to catch up with Scott Harris, the owner of Viva Raw. He was doing the cleanse and brought fresh juice for everyone to try. Viva Raw uses local and organic produce to make their juices and will deliver them to your door if you live in Charlotte. Ive tasted Viva Raw juices and their protein blend a couple of times now and definitely recommend them, especially if you want to do a juice cleanse!We had the vegan potluck at Plan Breathe  I havent done a breath works class there yet  but I heard its like tripping on oxygen. Sounds fun!My talk was about dairy. My favorite moment was hearing the room get silent when I talked about how the female cow is the #1 over worked animal in the world. Typically kept pregnant by artificial insemination for 7 months out of every year  which equates in human terms to us running about 8 hours every single day for 7 months. Can you imagine the toxic stress hormone we would produce in our bodies if we did that? Well its the same for the cow  and you are consuming those toxins if you consume dairy products.(Maybe I should video tape the next talk I am giving in Feb  so I can play it for all of you? What do you think?)At the end of the night  Elle presented me with the most beautifully gorgeous wrapped gift in a vintage apron. A special something from her fashion inspired business  Urban Gypsy.Even though I ate a full plate of foodI came home at 10pm absolutely starving! I went straight into the pantry and made a big bowl of candy! Breaking Habit #3 was worth it, dont you think?In honor of the cows  Im going to sign off with a big loud.Moooooo!Food Babe32@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

Should I get the Flu Shot?,http://foodbabe.com/2011/10/04/should-i-get-the-flu-shot/,"***Disclaimer  This post is strictly based upon my opinion and consultation of my own health provider, I recommend you make the best choice for you and your family based upon your own due diligence and research on this topic. *** One of the goals I made in starting this blog back in April, was to uncover and unveil information that isnt readily available for public consumption on true health, nutrition and wellbeing. I want this blog to help you break free from the conventional wisdom that the food industry, government agencies, pharmaceutical and medical community try to push because of greed or corruption that is ultimately harmful to you and your family. I want you to walk away questioning what you put in your body  food or medicine. I want you to learn from my mistakes and adopt the positive discoveries Ive made. I want you to feel as good as I do. But most importantly I want to give you the information you need to make real informed decisions about your health.This is why it is extremely important to understand the Flu Shot  I want you to think about what you are directly injecting into your bloodstream. Before you consider jumping off the ledge with other lemmings and taking this years Flu Shot  Here are the questions I think you should ask yourselfWhats exactly in the Flu Shot? To sum it up  A bunch of toxic chemicals and additives that lead to several types of Cancers and Alzheimer disease over time.Heres a list of what could be lurking in that vial of vaccine:Egg Products (including avian contaminant viruses)AluminumThimersol (Mercury)Monosodium Glutamate (MSG)Chick Embryo CellsLatexFormaldehydeGelatinPolysorbate 80Triton X100 (strong detergent)Sucrose (table sugar)ResinGentamycinI wont eat any of these ingredients or even put them on my body  however, the mainstream medical community, government agencies and pharmaceutical companies suggest that I directly inject these ingredients into my bloodstream? And I need do it every year until I die? Are you freaking kidding me? Long term effects of the combination of these toxic additivesare very alarming  a very famous immunologist & geneticist has completed studies and research that shows in that every five flu shots a person receives over a ten year period they increase their risk of Alzheimer Disease by ten times! This is because of the ingredients above  Aluminum and Mercury  they slowly destroy your brain cells one by one.Does the Flu Shot really protect me against the Flu? No, the CDC even admits it doesnt protect you because the virus mutates every year and they cant predict which strains will hit. Even when they do get the strain right, they cant prove it actually works. Just do a google search for the effectiveness of the flu shot and just see how many studies prove it is ultimately unreliable and ineffective. In a couple of studies I read, The flu shot was compared to a placebo  The same number of people caught the flu regardless if they took the shot or not!Why do I have to get a Flu Shot every year? Arent vaccines suppose to immunize you for life? They have to continuously give you a flu shot, because it is not a real vaccine. Lets say for instance, you get a vaccine for another virus like Hepatitis A or B  you are immunized for life. Why isnt this the case with the flu vaccine? Because the scientists have not developed a real vaccine for the flu and are continuously guessing on how to come up with a new chemical formula that could be effective.Research has shown that it takes close to a full year to develop an effective vaccine against a virus  however, in developing the flu shot  scientists spend less than 4 months producing it so they can get it out for production before flu season starts. They dont have time to thoroughly test it or judge its reactions in the human body. They take a chance on the symptoms it causes and that it might work  are you willing to take this chance too?What kind of strain are they going to use this year for the Flu Shot? Its the same one as last year. Really? But then why do I need to get another shot if I got one last year? This is the way the pharmaceutical companies continue to make money off of you  The CDC says it wears off. And this brings me back to my previous point  if the flu vaccine were truly a vaccine  it wouldnt wear off. Think about it  Once you get chicken pox as a child, your body develops antibodies to strengthen your immune system from ever getting chicken pox again. This is how vaccines are suppose to work. But the flu shot doesnt work this wayThere is something wrong with this pictureWhy is there so much pressure to get the Flu Shot year after year? Why does every drug store have a sign up promoting the shot? Why are shots available at work? And at school? Why is their so much propaganda each year around this time? There is only one answer  Money. The making, distributing, and administering of the flu shot is a 7 Billion Dollar Industry. Each year the pharmaceutical industry eyes glow with $ signs when its time to make more as the American public become the guinea pigs again to try it out.Why are Flu Shots recommended for children, women who are pregnant and the elderly? Because that group of individuals typically have weaker immune systems and if they catch the flu and dont treat it in time it can lead to other complications like pneumonia. However,why would you give a group with already weakened immune systems something that weakens their immune systemsystemically further?The flu shot causes all sorts of side effects and symptoms likeMuscle pain, respiratory tract infections, eye problems, abnormal blood pressure, asthma, hives, and gastrointestinal problems that could also lead to other complications. This is why the vaccine isnt effective in the first place, because administering a drug that weakens the immune systems makes people even more susceptible to the flu! This is another reason I believe why some studies I read proved that the flu shot was not effective in treating the elderly.Why have some countries banned the Flu Shots in the past? Because it caused all sorts of terrible and sometimes deadly reactions in their children and other citizens. Australia banned the flu shot for all children under 5 last year when 250 children were hospitalized and one died after receiving the vaccine. Finland and Sweden also banned the shots and opened up an investigation last year. Dont you wonder why this didnt make major news here in the United States?Can I immunize myself naturally from the Flu? Yes! You can build lifetime antibodies against the infection. Just Skip the vaccine, boost your vitamin D intake, and encounter the flu naturally. If you encounter the flu  rest, take care of yourself, understand that your body needs a break and focus on getting better  This type of immunizing yourself works amazingly better than relying on an artificial injection that has been proven ineffective. Youll have these new antibodies for life that will ultimately protect you from similar strains of the virus better than any yearly shot could ever provide.What ongoing things should I be doing and getting from my diet to keep my Immune System healthy and to prevent getting the Flu?Exercise daily, Take Probiotics, Get Vitamin A from beta carotene, Vitamin C, B6, B12, Garlic, Zinc and plenty of Vitamin D. Building up your immune system can help your body fight off the flu virus before you experience symptoms and lessen the time you take to recover from the flu.Is Food Babe planning to take the Flu Shot?Given all the answers I have learned above  No, Im not taking the Flu Shot. Ever.Wishing you the best health life can offer and all the sunshine in my heart.Love,Food BabeP.S. If you know someone who would like to hear about this perspective, please share this post with them.P.S.S.I am notanti-vaccination, I choose not to take the flu shot for the ingredients they contain as stated above.129K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

Goodie Goodie Gumbo,http://foodbabe.com/2011/05/30/goodie-goodie-gumbo/,"Happy Memorial Day! Partying Hard with Family!Happy Memorial Day Weekend! Weve been spending this weekend with my cousin Raja and his wife Tina visiting from Dallas. In the middle of the night last night Raja declared we must make Gumbo for Sunday Funday! We had all been drinking and celebrating a huge family event. We were all a little delirious and tired from all the festivities.Raja & Tina  Dodging the speed street crowd on the way to celebrate my cousin Reevas graduationRaja, I could tell, was very enthusiastic about showing Food Babe his cooking skills. Ever sense Rajas arrival on Friday, hes been in my kitchen playing with my Shun knives and contemplating what he could chop next. He diced left over lemon rind from a garnish earlier in the day. You can tell Raja loves the kitchen as much as Food Babe. Maybe this is because our mothers, who were both pregnant with us, took us on our first trip together to India before we were even born. We are only a few weeks apart in age, both born Aries, a raging fire sign and have more in common than we both like to admit.A little excited first thing in the morning, prepping veggies before our trip to Earth FareRaja is from Louisiana and well, not the healthiest state in America and wanted to make traditional gumbo. We began to discuss whats exactly is in gumbo.. he declared all sorts of Food Babe unfriendly ingredients like bleached white flour, inorganic oils, and pre-cooked conventional & nitrate filled sausage and was very hesitant, in fact, adamantly against changing the original recipe. I pleaded with him back and forth and finally he was convinced we could make this organic.So here it is  Organic GOODIE GOODIE Gumbo!Going to Earth Fare for all the organic goodsTina in charge of the cartLooking for the best bell peppers in the houseEarth Fare hand made fresh Andouille Sausage  doesnt get fresher than thisChecking out  This was the least Ive spent at Earth Fare ever.

Are Baby Carrots Soaked in Chlorine?,http://foodbabe.com/2013/05/03/are-baby-carrots-soaked-in-chlorine/,"If youve been following along onFacebook, you know that I was in NYC earlier this week to film an investigative report well, now it is out!Inside Editioninterviewed me as a food expert,regarding thebaby carrot controversysweeping the web.Watch the full story here:For the record: I love carrots, I eat them or juice them almost everyday, but personally I do not buy baby carrots, because I prefer the taste of larger, non-ready to eat carrots better.Also, if you know me, you know this  I want the least amount of environmental chemicals to enter my body. I filter my water at home (to remove chlorine and other chemicals) and wash my vegetables with filtered water before consuming them.The most important decision you can make at the grocery store regarding carrots is not whether they come in a bag or not but rather if they are organic or conventional. According to the USDA Pesticide Data Program,conventional carrots can have up to 26 different pesticideson them (16 of them are hormone disruptors, 8 are carcinogens, 7 are reproductive toxins, and 3 are neurotoxins).My recommendation for everyone is to choose organic carrots for this reason.Here are some behind the scenes photos from the shoot. I had an absolute blast chatting with Paul Boyd from Inside Edition  hes quite the comic! We even taste tested the carrots. Baby carrots are grown from a sweeter variety and you can definitely tell the difference in taste!Hope you enjoyed the clip!Food BabeP.S.

Monsanto Is Scrambling To Bury This Breaking Story – Don’t Let This Go Unshared!,http://foodbabe.com/2016/11/15/monsanto/,"I am frankly shocked this information is not making front page newsright now.Monsanto will do anything to bury this story and as of right now, its working. Not a single mainstream media outlet has covered this appalling new report that shows millions of people being poisoned by a chemical that does not belong in our food.This chemical is ending up in processed foods like Cheerios, Ritz Crackers, and Oreos and being consumed by humans across the world.The health of millions of people is on the lineand this newsmust go mainstream! Thats whyIm calling on every single one of you who reads this post toshare this breaking story now.The only way this injustice will be corrected is if enough of us stand up and demand that something be done to stop the poisoning of our food supply.Share this shocking new report with everyone you know.A FDA-registered food safety laboratory tested iconic American food for residues of the weed killer glyphosate (aka Monsantos Roundup) and foundALARMING amounts.Just to give you an idea of how outrageous these amounts are, independent research shows that probable harm to human health begins atreally low levels of exposure  at only0.1 ppbof glyphosate. Manyfoods were found to have over 1,000 times this amount! Well above what regulatorsthroughout the world consider safe.{See thetest results and full report by Food Democracy Now! and The Detox Project}.Here is why we all should be concerned about eating glyphosate:Independent research links glyphosate to cancer (sources:1,2,3,4,5) and it has been deemed a probable human carcinogen by the World Health Organizations team of international cancer experts. Thechildhood cancer rate is steadily risingand experts say that they dont know why. Why are they not taking a closer look at these facts?Research also indicates that glyphosate is anendocrine disruptor, which disrupts hormones and leads to reproductive problems, early onset puberty, obesity, diabetes, and some cancers. When it comes to endocrine disruptors,very small exposuresare the most damaging, sothe dose makes the poison mantradoes not apply!Glyphosate isa broad-spectrum antibiotickilling the good bacteria in your gut.Poor gut healthis linked to inflammation and a whole host of diseases. As GMOs laced with glyphosate are commonly fed to farm animals, this could very well becontributing to antibiotic-resistant bacteria.It binds with vital nutrients in the soil (like iron, calcium, manganese, zinc) andprevents plants for taking them up. Glyphosateis thereby making food less nutritious!Why is this weed killerin these foods? Even non-GMO and organic food!This chemical has gone so mainstream that glyphosate has infiltrated every facet of our environment  our water, air, soil.ManyGMOs were invented to be resistant to glyphosate  and since GMOs have been introduced the use of glyphosate has gone through the roof! It is now the worlds most widely used herbicide.Glyphosateis not just used on GMOs. Conventional (non-organic farmers) use Roundup as a drying agent on crops, such as oats and wheat. It cantbe simply washed off, as it is taken up into the plant itself.As the active ingredient in popular Roundup herbicide, millions of people are using this stuff around their homes, and its widely used at parks and other public spaces.So, that is why its not just GMO-filled junk food that is laced with glyphosate. Its contaminating organic and non-GMO foods, and its even in our honey! The FDA quietly found it in almost every singlesample of honey that they tested (from mass produced to organic mountain honey). The media has been essentiallysilent and barely anyone heard this news!Even if you dont personally eat thespecific brands that were tested (I dont), how many peopleare eating Cheerios and Ritz Crackersevery day? A lot! How many of your friends and family have their cabinets filled with these foods?These people need to know this information.There are still thousands of other brands and whole foods that have not been tested for glyphosate residues, so we cant be so sure that our own organic, non-GMO, and unprocessed food is safe. Americans are effectively being forced to eat this poison until something is done to stop the rampant use of this chemical. Yes, I said poison.Monsanto doesnt want the public to know these findings for obvious reasons. They have our regulatory agencies in their back pocket to make sure they can continue to make a hefty profit while poisoning the masses.While there are now several manufacturers of glyphosate herbicides, Monsanto completely dominates the market and this is a best seller. They are raking in BILLIONS every year and certainly dont want that to stop. They are clearly, without a doubt, using their prosperity to influence our government regulators. Why else wouldthose entrusted to protect the public from harmful chemicals turn a blind eye to this? Our public agencies are allowingcorporations to poison Americans for profit.In 2013, the EPA massively increasedthe industry standard of what is considered a safe level of glyphosate on our food, in order to make enormous amounts seem A-OK. Instead of properly regulating, they effectively raised the safe level so that no one can blame the industry for poisoning us with unlawfulamounts of chemicals.This is corruption at its finest.The EPAhas a long and sordid history of doing whatever Monsanto wants and you have to ask yourself why this continues to happen and how we can make it stop.The EPA continues to pander to Monsanto, as they keep postponing and dragging their feet to evaluate glyphosates link to cancer in humans. The industry is fightingtooth and nail to make sure that the EPAevaluation will be in their favor and is trying to control who will be on the panel. Why wont the EPA do their job to make sure that the worlds most widely used herbicide isnt causing us all to get cancer? Dont you think this should be a top priority? Its time for the EPA to put the public health above the corrupt desires of corporations. When it comes to the FDA, they are not protecting the American public from glyphosate either. After announcing in February that they would FINALLY begin testing foods for glyphosate residues, they just decided tosuspend their testingthis week. Could it be that Monsanto didnt like the results they started getting  especially since the FDA found glyphosate in foods that should be especially safe like BABY FOOD? Monsanto will do whatever it takes to keep that story out of the public eye.Doesnt the public deserve to know this information? It should be shouted from the rooftops!It is shameful that the American media has thus far failed to cover this breaking news, but WE HAVE THE POWER to make this information go viral. If you really want to stop the corruption perpetuated by Monsanto and the large chemical companies  this is how we shut them down! CALL TO ACTION: Share this post with everyone you know. Tweet, share, and email this information to major media outletsand ask them to cover this story.Remember the best way to avoid glyphosate is bychoosing certified organic foods because it is prohibited on organic crops.

The Exciting Changes The Food Industry Made in 2015 Because Of Us!,http://foodbabe.com/2016/01/01/the-exciting-changes-the-food-industry-made-in-2015-because-of-us/,"Happy New Year! Welcome to 2016!Reading all the news about food this past yearhas been a bit surreal for me. It seems like there was a new announcement every week that eliminated another chunk of our food supply that was once tainted with chemical additives, GMOs or antibiotics.Our world istransforming and its absolutely beautiful to be part of with all of you.Theres a landslide of artificial additives falling out of our food. You (the Food Babe Army), along with hundreds of food activists and consumer interest groups, have truly been at the helmof manyof these changes.Youve beenleading the way by sharing investigations, signing petitions, and simply asking for healthier food without fake chemical additives, flavors, colors, preservatives, and GMOs.While we all know these changes are just a startand weve got a long way to go I thought it would be a good idea to sit back and take a look at all thats happened in just the last 12months. Seeing this picture of my topnine most liked Instagram posts in 2015  sums it up pretty good, but there is so much more that happened. When you see the long list below, you might do a double take, but thats what we did in just one year! We made history together and its AMAZING.JANUARY 2015Heineken Newcastle Brown Ale (January 26, 2015) Removedcaramel coloring (level IV) to their Newcastle Brown Ale, and will go back to coloring it the natural way with roasted malt. In 2013, following extensive work done by CSPIwho sued the government to require ingredient labels on alcohol30 years ago, I publishedthe long list of hidden ingredients that are permitted to be used in beerswithout labeling. At that time, Ireached out to Heineken as the maker of my husbands favorite beer  Newcastle  and disclosedon my blog that they color it artificially with caramel color andthis post went absolutely viralwith millions of page views. I also wrote a chapter about all the additives in alcohol in my NYT Best Selling bookThe Food Babe Way, which I released early in December before the book came out. I continued tocorrespondwithHeinekenperiodically until they emailed me this January, as your husbands former favorite beer. I wanted to make sure you knew that we have removed caramel coloring from Newcastle completely.FEBRUARY 2015General Mills  (February 6, 2015) In response to our petition asking them to dump the BHT just as they do overseas, General Mills said that they will be removing this controversial preservative from their cereals. They have yet to provide a timeline for its removalbut theyhave made progress and havesince removed BHT from some varieties of their cereal  Golden Grahams, Cocoa Puffs, Banana Nut Cheerios, and Corn Chex no longer contain BHT. Kelloggs also committed to look into removing this verycontroversial additive, but has not provided a timeline either.Nestle Chocolate  (February 17, 2015) Announced that they will get rid of artificial colors and artificial flavors from their chocolate candies, including Butterfinger and Crunch bars, by the end of this year. In 2012, weexposed the artificial additives in candy bars, a post you shared thousands of times. Now at least two of these additives (artificial colors and artificial flavors) will be gone from Nestle chocolate for good!Hersheys Chocolate  (February 24, 2015) On the heels of Nestles big announcement, Hersheys said they are cleaning up their famous Milk Chocolate Bars and Hersheys Kisses, by removing GMO sugar and GMO soy lecithin, polyglycerol polyricinoleate (PGPR), vanillin and artificial flavors, and will use milk from cows not treated with the growth hormone rBST. In 2012, I wrote about the GMOs in most popular chocolates and asked for a boycott of these brands (including Hersheys) until they got rid of the GMOs and last December GMO Inside started a campaign to get GMO sugar out of Hersheys Chocolate.MARCH 2015McDonalds  (March 4, 2015) Announced that over the next 2 years they will stop using chickens that were treated with antibiotics commonly used for humans after behind the scenes pressure from us and several consumer interest and activist groups:NRDC, Friends of The Earth,Pew Charitable Trusts, Consumers Union, Center for Food Safety,FACT, Keep Antibiotics Working, Consumers International, U.S. PIRG and others. You shared so many posts from here on FoodBabe.com about the dangers of feeding growth-promoting antibiotics to animals, notably here,here, here, and on CNN here. This is huge news, as McDonalds is one of the biggest industry leaders.Costco  (March 5, 2015) Just one day following McDonalds, Costco reports to the media that they are in the process of eliminating chicken and meat that was raised on human-use antibiotics from their stores.Dunkin Donuts  (March 10, 2015) Removed the whitening agent titanium dioxide from their powdered sugar, following a campaign by the non-profit group As You Sow. Theydecided to remove it after As You Sow reportedly foundtitanium dioxide nanoparticles in their powdered donuts. This is important because nanoparticles (super tiny particles) arent necessarily safe and can be more dangerousthan larger versions of the same substances.APRIL 2015McDonalds  (April 2, 2015) Starting to clean up their grilled chicken, and wontcook it in the liquid margarine that theyve used for years in many of their menu items. They are removing sodium phosphates and maltodextrin from their grilled artisan chicken breasts. In March, we put a spotlight on theinsane amount of additives found in McDonalds food, even their healthier items like their Premium Southwest Grilled Chicken Salad, full of soybean oil, hidden MSG, and high fructose corn syrup (and thats without the dressing).Kraft  (April 20, 2015) Kraft finally announced plans to drop the artificial colors (yellow #5 and yellow #6) from all of their Mac & Cheese products. This came after we launched a petition in 2013 asking them to remove these fake dyes made from petroleum, and to use the same safer natural food colorings that they use in other countries. Ourpetition ultimately garnered over 365,000 signatures and received widespread media attention. When I visited their headquarters to deliver signed petitions two years ago, they told me that we would have to agree to disagree  and revealed no plans to remove these dyes. Well, we did it! The fake dyes in Kraft Mac & Cheese will be ancient history by January 2016.Pilgrim Pride  (April 20, 2015) Told reporters that they are working to stop the use of human-use antibiotics in their chickens within 18 months, and has further plans to eliminate all antibiotics from  of their chickens by 2019. Pilgrim is one of the major suppliers of chicken to Chick-Fil-A, and as the 2nd largest poultry processor in the U.S. this news should rock the industry. My #1 request when I met with Chick-Fil-A in 2012 was for them to go antibiotic-free and when they finally committed to this requestin 2014 itbegan to make shock waves!Chipotle  (April 28, 2015) Officially dumped all genetically modified (GMO) ingredients from their food (excluding animal products and drinks). This means that they are no longer using tortillas with GMO ingredients and wont be cooking their beans in GMO soybean oil any longer. In 2013 we finally convinced Chipotle to list their ingredients online publicly, after weexposed the GMOs in most of their menu items. Not only did you share this post a lot, but some citizen activists even started a petition based on my investigation. The pressure worked!Tyson  (April 28, 2015) As the largest U.S. poultry producer, Tyson announced huge plans to stop using human-use antibiotics in their chickens by September 2017, and is working on this for other meat as well. Tyson is also a major chicken supplier for McDonalds, so this move was likely influenced by them.Wendys  (April 29, 2015) Starts offering their first organic item: tea.MAY 2015Panera Bread  (May 4, 2015) Announced they are removing 150 artificial additives, including artificial colors, BHT, nitrates, high fructose corn syrup, hidden MSG, and partially hydrogenated oils. Wecalled out Panera back in 2012for using nitrates and hidden MSG ingredients like hydrolyzed corn and soy protein, autolyzed yeast extract and yeast extract. Now those ingredients will be history! They are all slated to be removed by the end of 2016. This commitment also extends into their soft drinks, as the New York Times reported that Panera is going to either sell Pepsi products without high fructose corn syrup, or kick them to the curb!Target  (May 19, 2015) Reportedly told big name brands like Kraft, General Mills, Campbells, and Kelloggs that they were going to stop heavily promoting their products in their stores. Instead, Target will stock their shelves with more food from healthier organic brands.Walmart  (May 22, 2015) Askedtheir suppliers to stop the use of growth-promoting antibiotics. Theyre also asking them to follow five principles of animal welfare, ensuring the animals are not starved, have sufficient space to move, and do not suffer mental distress.Abbott Laboratories  (May 25, 2015) The maker of Similac Advance baby formula cameout with a non-GMO version thatissold in Target stores. They will also be launching a non-GMO Similac Sensitive formula, and if sales are strong they will offer more non-GMO varieties. In 2014, we reported the results of testing done by Consumer Reports that found GMOs in many popular infant formulas, including two Similac formulas. Several activist groups (Green America, GMO Inside, As You Sow) have been working extensively to rid GMOs from infant formulas.Unilever  (May 26, 2015) Announced they are coming out with a new non-GMO Hellmanns Mayonnaise made with olive oil. Since most mayonnaise dressings are made with GMO soybean oil, and Hellmans is an industry leader, GMO Inside started a campaign last year to get the GMOs out of Hellmans real mayo. (This non-GMO mayonnaise is already in some stores, but beware that the eggs used were raised on GMO feed and non-GMO soybean oil is an ingredient).JUNE2015Subway  (June 4, 2015) Plans to remove all artificial flavors, colors and preservatives in the U.S. and Canadaby 2017. This is clearly just a start, but I was thrilled that they have been working onremoving caramel coloring from their cold cuts!But, they made no mention of the breads that still contain it. Subway has so far been tight lipped about which specific ingredients and preservatives they are nixing.I first broke down the ingredients in a Subway sandwich 2012, and showed that every Eat Fresh sandwich contained preservatives, andthey stilluse a lot of them! Artificial yellow dye shouldbe coming out of their fat-free Italian dressing, banana peppers, andpickles.Subwaycurrently uses artificial flavors in a number of items (like a few of their breads and cookies), but if all theyre going to do is replace those with natural flavors that isnt an improvement.General Mills Cereal  (June 22, 2015) Removing artificial colors and artificial flavors from all of their cereals, including Lucky Charms, Trix, and Reeses Puffs. For instance, instead of using Red #40, Yellow #6 in Trix, theyre going to start coloring it naturally with turmeric and berry juices  which is huge news for parents that report that their children are sensitive to these artificial food dyes. The majority of their cereals dont contain artificial colors already, but 40% dountil these changes finish rolling out in waves by the end of 2017.Papa Johns Pizza  (June 23, 2015) Announced theyre removing 14 ingredientsby the end of 2016, including artificial colors, caramel color, the preservative sodium benzoate, and hidden MSG ingredients like autolyzed yeast extract and hydrolyzed proteins. We wrote all about these hidden MSG ingredients used in Papa Johns pizza in our pizza investigation in 2014, and reported their lack of transparency in refusing to disclose ingredient lists. Since ourinvestigation, they listedingredients on their website (however thislist is NOT complete).If youheard the news that Pizza Hut & Taco Bell are removing artificial ingredients hereswhat I think about that in this video!July 2015Campbells  (July 23, 2015) Theyregetting rid of artificial flavors and artificial colors by2018 in all of their brands  Campbells Soup, Pepperidge Farm, Swanson. Theywill also remove high fructose corn syrup from some products and offer more organic products.In 2013, I wrote about how Pepperidge Farm duped my familyinto buying their products full of artificial additives  this post was viewed by millions of people because you shared it. Once you learn this information, you cant unlearn it and thats why these companies have had to change for the better! Wendys  (July 27, 2015) Starts offering chicken raised without antibiotics in four test markets.August 2015Kelloggs  (August 5, 2015) Following General Mills lead, they will start removingartificial colors and flavors in their cereals, snack bars and Eggo products to be completedby end of 2018.Starbucks  (August 17, 2015) Starbucks published the new ingredients in their reformulated Pumpkin Spice Latte, which now includes real pumpkin and no caramel coloring, on their blog. This camefollowingmy initial investigation into their ingredients in 2012 and after millions of you readmy post aboutStarbucks PSLin 2014,which exposed their lack of transparency about ingredients and that the PSLcontained class IV caramel coloring thats linked to cancer.In March, Ireceived an email fromStarbucks corporate offices confirming they removed caramel color from their vanilla syrup and willfrom their other beverages.General Mills Fruit Snacks  (August 25, 2015) Fruit Rollups, Fruit By The Foot, and Fruit Gushers will be free of artificial colors and flavors by the end of 2017. In 2014 I called out the unhealthy Generally Toxic ingredientsand thousands of you shared this post.McDonalds  (August 31, 2015) Starts using real butter and ditches the trans-fat containing buttery spread that they previously used.September 2015McCormick  (September 8, 2015)Introduced non-GMO vanilla extract (many brands contain GMO corn syrup) and said80% of their gourmet herbs & spices will be organic and 70% of all of their herbs, spices, and extracts will be non-GMO by 2016. This is big news because although the spices themselves are not GMO, they can be mixed with derivatives of GMO corn or soy, and many spices are heavily sprayed with synthetic pesticides and irradiated (not allowed on organics). You shared this post about all additives that could be lurking in your spice cabinetthousands of times!October 2015Mondelez (October 1, 2015) Removing artificial colors and flavors many products such astheirOreo cookies and Ritz crackers but they gave themselves until 2020 to do it.Aldi Grocery Stores  (October 1, 2015)Removed artificialcolors, partially hydrogenated oils (trans fat) and MSG from their store-brand products.Subway  (October 20, 2015)Committed to eliminating the use of antibiotics in all of their meat in the U.S.  and they also provided a timeline. This announcement came followingour major petition in conjunction with other petitions launchedbyotherconsumer advocacy groups (U.S. PIRG,NRDC,Center for Food Safety,Friends of the Earthand others) thatIve been working closely with for the last year. All of these petitions received a total of over 250,000 signatures! I was literally about to board a plane to deliver petitions to their headquarters when this announcement was made!Schwans  (October 21, 2015) Working to removepartially hydrogenated oils, high-fructose corn syrup, artificial flavors and artificial colors by 2017 from their many brands such asRed Baron, Tonys, Freschetta pizza, and Mrs. Smiths.November 2015Guinness Beer  (November 2, 2015)Willeliminate the use of isinglass (fish bladders) in their refining process, making their beers vegan-friendly. Many people were unaware of this practicewhich I exposed in my 2013 beer investigationand my book, and although it may not be harmful, its use is not labeled anda big concern for vegans who would never guess that animal parts are used to produce some beers.December 2015Papa Johns  (December 18, 2015) Joins the growing list of restaurantsthat will no longer servechickenraised on antibiotics. By next summer, their grilled chicken pizza topping and chicken poppers will be antibiotic-free.As You Can See. We accomplished a lot this year! Everything that is happening in this giant GOOD FOOD MOVEMENT is mind blowing to me.Please note, this list only captures just some of the changes we directly impacted or were involved with, but so much more is happening behind closed doors. Food companies everywhere are making tweaks without alerting the media and public, so make sure to pay attention to those ingredient lists and keep asking questions!Ittruly has taken hundreds of food activists and consumer interest groups, along with all of us working together, sharing investigations and petitionswith ourfriends and families, to spreadthis movementlike wildfire. These companies know that we wont back down, and that we are looking to them to keep improving their products.It certainly seems thatsome additives that have been mainstays in processed food for decades (like artificial colors) will soon be out of our food for good. This is a really exciting time! I love this quote from Richard McCarthy of Slow Food USA on this current food movement:What was once considered unrealistic is now pragmatic and good businessWhile the fine print may not speak to dramatic shiftsthe bounds of thinkable thoughts are moving towards our belief that food should be good, clean and fair.I thank you and all the food activists that work along side us for your incredible work. Looking back at what we have accomplished this year together, continues to blow my mind! Wish I could hug each of you in person for changing the world with me  who knows, maybe soon?!? I hope.Heres to making even bigger changes in 2016!Happy New Year,VaniP.S. Im currently working on threebig investigations  the ones you have been asking for!!! So stay tuned!

3 Things Doctors Say You Should Do… But Shouldn’t!,http://foodbabe.com/2015/06/02/3-things-doctors-say-you-should-do-but-shouldnt/,"This post is written by Dr. Joel Kahn, otherwise known as Americas Holistic Heart Doc. Dr.Kahn is a practicing interpreventional cardiologistwho also writes for Readers Digest. He has taught dozens of residents and cardiologists, andgraciously accepted to be a speaker at the launch party for The Food Babe Way in New York City back in February. I am thrilled to have him as a contributor here!I am hardly a doctor basher. Last I checked, I was a cardiologist actively involved in seeing hundreds of patients a month. In the next few months I am lecturing at several medical meetings sponsored by University faculty and hold the position of professor at 3 universities myself. But it is no exaggeration to say that in general conventional medicine is slow to adapt new ideas and platforms. While I could pick many aspects of practice that are due for an overhaul, I want to focus on 3 that come to mind that need to be flushed from medical jargon.1.Moderation in everything is the keyThis is simply wrong. My advice for patients is extreme in diet, moderate in fitness, abundant in love. Why do I say that? Although I wont go into detail about fitness, there is abundant research in the last few years that extreme exercise, like repeated marathons or triathalons, may acutally increase the risk of heart diseases. The current mantra is exercise is like a medication and the dose matters. More central is the issue of nutrition. Simply put, medical societies have failed to address the critical connection between diet and the origin and reversal of chronic diseases. For example, years ago Dr. Dean Ornish compared the impact of the diet and lifestyle on blocked heart arteries. The control group was told to follow their doctors dietary recommendations and the experimental group was told to follow an extremediet constituting mainly plants. At the end of 5 years, heart artery blockages became more severe in the conventional group but showed reversal in the extreme diet! Other examples of extreme diets stressing quality of foods, plant-centeric approaches, and organic produce have shown reduction in cancer growth, reversal of aging, and reduced excretion of pesticides in children and adults. I advise you to be vigilant in what goes into your awesome body to maximize your health and vitality.2.Vitamins just make expensive urineOh how doctors love to bash vitamins, or nutraceuticals if you want to impress friends. When I am at a party with doctors and it is a bit dull I just say in a loud voice, excuse me, I have to go take my last few dozen vitamins! Sure, there are legitimate areas of confusion but are all vitamins just window dressing to make someone rich? Hardly based on the science. For example, take Coenzyme Q10, an antioxidant and substrate to make energy in every cell in the body . Can you find CoQ10 in a hospital? Can patients or their families freely bring a bottle into the hospital to use for health? The vitamins will likely be confiscated like crack. How strange when studies show improved outcome including death when CoQ10 was studied in rigorous trials. My favorite 4 vitamins, or my Core 4, for all to consider is a probiotic to improve their gut health or microbiome, chelated magnesium to assist in over 300 enzymatic reactions, Vitamin D3, and CoQ10. Shh, I take about 20 more to assist optimal cellular health on a daily basis.3.A sleeping pill wont hurt youAt that same time that medical science has shown the importance of 7 good hours of sleep to restore our metabolism to normal overnight after a stressful day, fewer and fewer people are achieving those good 7 hours. Whether it is EMF and wifi, bright lights rich in 480 nm blue waves from our PCs, pads and phones, or jobs that hyper-connect us 24/7, nearly a majority of respondents to surveys indicate that they sleep poorly. So what is the harm in your doctor giving you a prescription for a sleeping pill (hypnotic) or stress pill (anxiolytic) to help you sleep for the rest of your life? In fact, that recommendation from your doctor may risk your very life. In a recent matched-cohort study from American clinics, a prescription for even <18 sleeping pills a year was associated with a 3-fold increased risk of death and higher doses increased the risk of dying by 5-fold. Of course, it may be that people getting those prescriptions had other reasons for poor sleep that were associated with death but we must consider the possibility of a direct relationship. In another even more recent analysis involving 100,000 subjects, a prescription for hypnotics or anxiolytics was associated with a risk of dying that was over 300% higher than those without a similar prescription.What should you do if you are sleeping poorly? I suggest you say No Thank You to your doctors prescription. Make your bedroom cold and dark. Turn off your wifi and cellphone if you can. Take an Epsom salt bath and meditate for 10-20 minutes before bed. Consider adding a nighttime cocktail of chamomile tea, magnesium lotions or powders, or herbs like valerian before bed. I sleep on sheets that ground me to the earth and recommend that approach to you too.Life has changed dramatically since Marcus Welby MD and Dr. Spock advised us on how to maintain our health. Even Dr. Spock reevaluated his advice to so many mothers late in his life and advised extreme care in dietary choices for optimal health. We live in an age where it is acceptable to question medical authority, particularly on issues about nutrition, and it is advisable to link over to www.pubmed.com and search the National Library of Medicine to seek your own information. When I went to medical school at the University of Michigan my favorite professor told me that 50% of what he was going to teach us was wrong, but he did not know which 50% it was.While you dont throw out the baby, or your health care provider, with the bathwater, it is permissible to question medical advice with the simple question: Why?More about Dr. Joel Kahn:Dr. Kahn is a practicing interpreventional cardiologist, known as Americas Holistic Heart Doc, who graduated summa cum laude from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor in 1983. Dr. Kahn has been practicing invasive, interventional and preventive cardiology in suburban Detroit since 1990, and was advanced to full Clinical Professor of Medicine (Cardiology) at Wayne State University School of Medicine and Associate Professor of Medicine at Oakland University Beaumont School of Medicine. Readers Digest magazine selected Dr. Kahn for their Holistic Heart Doc column and their publishing arm published his book, The Whole Heart Solution, in 2014. He appears regularly on Fox TV 2 in Detroit as a health commentator. He has been nominated as a Top Doc in cardiology for most of the past years. In 2011, he received a certification from the University of South Florida in Metabolic Cardiology, and became the first physician to complete the program in the world. He is now a visiting lecturer for that university and has traveled the country speaking. To learn more, visit drjoelkahn.com.Note from Vani: What do you think about Dr.Kahns post?

10 Grocery Store Items You Should Never Buy Again (Plus the good alternative swaps!),http://foodbabe.com/2014/10/21/10-grocery-store-items-you-should-never-buy-again/,"Earlier this monthon my Facebook page, I asked you to share yourbiggest ah-ha moment whenyou started to read ingredient lists. I asked this question because Im curious about what opened your eyes to the processed chemicals the food industry is dumping in our food.There were over 1,500 responses on Facebook to my question, and I tried to read every single one of them. I found your comments insightful, really encouraging, and some were really funny! Im glad to see that so many of you are changing your eating habits and reading ingredient lists!Isaw severalrecurring ah-ha moments (the same ones I had when I started my journey), so I am summarizing the top 10 most popular ones here for you to share with your friends and family, just in case they havent had these ah-ha moments yet. You might even see your own ah-ha moment quoted below! If you didnt already know about any of these major offenses at the grocery store, this will also give you tips for what to lookout for next time youre shopping.10 Grocery Store Items You Should Never Buy Again:1. Pickles & Relish That Contain Artificial Food DyeWHY do they need to add artificial chemical coloring? Same with everything that adds chemical for coloring. Its just WRONG ~ SaraPickles started a food change in my house when I realized my children couldnt even eat a pickle without eating yellow #4 & #5. Totally changed how we eat! ~ TracyYellow #5 in my Pickleshuh?? Why on Gods green earth is that in there?!! ~ CarrinTheres Yellow-5 in Mt Olive dill pickles!! ~ Josh and ErikaFood dyes. Its even in pickles! Really?!?! Couldnt understand that one. Grandmas pickles were always green and she never used yellow #6 ~ BeckyThis week it was Vlasic dill pickles, which we usually keep a giant jar of. Why do pickles need food coloring? ~ JulieDyes. Especially items like food coloring in pickles. Um, WHY? ~ HeatherPickles have yellow #6! WTH?? Why?? ~ AmberWhy do we insist on putting artificial colors in everything?!! Pickles arent supposed to be fluorescent!!! Nature colors things beautifully on its own! ~ ChelsLynFood dye in pickles..idk why but it pissed me off ~ TinaRelishwould never have thought there would be food coloring in relish. Blech!!! ~ KimOmg pickles? ~ VanessaRecently I looked at every single jar of pickles in a conventional grocery store, and only found one brand that didnt contain artificial yellow food dye. Of course, there is no real reason to add dye to pickles, as its just used to make them look prettier and gives us no other benefits. Artificial colors are linked to health issues and have been banned or require a warning labels in several other countries  so food manufacturers often take them out of their products in other countries. Most pickles contain Yellow #5 or #6, which havebeen shown to contribute to childhood behavioral problems. Better Store-Bought Alternative:Real Pickles (brand) organic pickles, Woodstock organic pickles.2. Canned Soups WithMSG!That all my favorite soups have MSGs in them. ~ TeresaWhen I compared a cream of chicken soup label to a recipe & realized how basic & easy it is to home-make with only 4 ingredients!I literally got angry!! ~ BrandiI ate my usual Dr MacDougalls lentil soup today and then noticed it had yeast extract in it. Seriously??? Hidden MSG in healthy soup?? Ugh!!! ~ AndreaHigh fructose corn syrup in canned and boxed tomato soup. I couldnt find any available product without sugar, so I had to make my own! ~ SaraWhen I realized that the chicken bullion I put in my soup was basically a block of msg. ~ KellyJust how awful most canned and boxed foods are. And how extensive the naughty list is. I used to keep cream of soups in the pantry and use them in my casseroles. I just cant bring myself to do that anymore. ~ ChristineCampbells chicken and stars soup  shocked it has High fructose corn syrup and MSG! Never giving this to my kids again! ~ CandiceSoy in 90% of soups in grocery stores ~ MelanieMSG (akaMonosodium Glutamate) is areally common ingredient in packaged soup, along withhidden MSG ingredients like hydrolyzed protein and autolyzed yeast extract. These flavor enhancers trickyour braininto eating more than you should and have been linked to headaches, obesity, depression, and mental disorders. Better Store-Bought Alternative: Amys Organic Lentil Soup or make your own like I do. Heres a recipe for one of my favorites  carrot ginger soup.3. Salad Dressings That Are Full Of GMO Oils!Salad dressings!! They all have soybean oil!!! And basically how EVERYTHING has soy in it ~ SierraGluten in salad dressings ~ DaviYellow food dye in Italian salad dressing. Why?!?! ~ NeekaCant eat salad dressings because of soy/canola oils. I now must get over it and make my own. ~ NormaMSG is in a lot of foods even salad dressings no wonder I was getting migraines! Im highly sensitive to it ~ CarolineThat nearly every salad dressing has Xanthan gum or guar gum in it. ~ SusanSOYBEAN OIL and/ or canola in every single salad dressing or mayonnaise!! We just make our own now. ~ MelissaThis is why I make my own salad dressing. Its super easy to whip up a vinaigrette at home to avoid dumping GMO soybean oils all over your healthy salad. You might be surprised to know that even salad dressings that say they are made with olive oil (likeWishbone Olive Oil Vinaigrette) typically contain soybean oil asamain ingredient. Almost all store-bought salad dressings also contain emulsifier ingredients to help them stay blended on the shelf, but dont do anything good for your health.Better Store-Bought Alternatives: Raw Foodz Salad Dressing (not available everywhere),Hilarys Eat Well Salad Dressing &Wilderness Family Naturals Salad Dressing. If you are a Food Babe Eating Guide subscriber, youll get a new (and easy) salad dressing recipe every month as part of the plan. Check it outhere.4. Bread That Has Way Too Many Nasty Ingredients!Many packaged breads and baked goods contain L-cysteinea non-essential amino acid made from dissolved human hair (often from China) or duck feathers (mmmm). Food manufacturers use the ingredient as a commercial dough conditioner, meant to change the texture of breads and baked goods. ~ ArthurHigh fructose corn syrup in bread. ~ SeanColor and corn fructose in my 100% whole wheat bread. Argh ~ VanessaGMO corn syrup in bread. ~ KrystlHigh fructose corn syrup in light wheat bread. ~ KatieBread! Such a simple food is now a health hazard if purchased in most grocery stores. ~ Farmhouse Blues InteriorsHigh fructose corn syrup and the long list of ingredients that go into bread. ~ ArushiOnce I started noticing all the products (Baked items/Breads) that have Azodicarbonamide in them. Since quitting eating foods with that my respiratory issues have gone away. SO glad I found out about that horrible, unnecessary ingredient being put in food. ~ TraeBreadsomething you think is a simple staple ~ LaurieOne thing that drives me nuts it bread with 30 ingredients! Wth! It should have maybe 5! Egh! ~ JacquelineHow about store bought bread?! Can you believe all of the stuff that is in it?! Homemade is sooooo much better for you. Time consuming, yes, but way better for you! ~ DarcyIts nearly impossible to find bread at the store without dough conditioners(like the yoga mat chemicalazodicarbonamide), added sugars, artificial colorsand GMOs  which is ridiculous because it really only takes 4 ingredients to make bread. Although I dont eat a lot of bread, when I do I dont want to be subjected to unnecessary and harmful ingredients. So, I generally stick to sprouted grain breads or gluten-free varieties that are made up of primarily seeds and healthy grainslikemilletandquinoa. Better Store-Bought Alternatives:Food For LifeEzekiel 4:9 Sprouted Grain Bread,Manna Gluten Free Ancient Grains Bread. Heres a list of more clean ingredient breads.5. Coffee Creamer That Is Full Of Trans Fat!Coffeemate coffee creamer. Omg???!!!!!!! Switched to organic half and half this week. ~ HomairaCoffee creamer..silicon dioxide anyone????? ~ MiriamCoffee creamer. So gross to even think about how much of that Ive consumed! ~ JulieCoffee creamer. I now make my own with all organic ingredients and couldnt be happier! ~ CaraCoffee creamerstill breaks my heart! ~ CristaYouve opened my eyes with carrageenan..I had no idea! I was drinking it every morning in my organic coffee creamer! ~ KateCreamers with carrageenan!! ~ BrandiWhen I found out that Coffee-Mate Non-DairyCreamers primary ingredient waspartially hydrogenated oil I was disgusted. Millions of people are dumping deadly trans fatinto their coffee every morning. Sure, theyonly use a bit in their coffee, but would anyonepour themselvesa full glass of it? Of course not. Yet, theyll eventually consume the entire container. This is theperfect example of why I think the motto Everything in Moderation is bogus. AFDA loophole allows Coffee-Mate toclaim that it has no trans fat because it contains less than 0.5 g. per serving,although their serving size is only 1 tablespoon. According to the CDC, trans fats are linked to 7,000 deaths and over 20,000 heart attacks!Better Store-Bought Alternatives: Coconut milk  its thick and creamy and most only contain 1 or 2 ingredients if you stick to the culinary version like Natural Value and Native Forest. You can also make your own coconut milk by combining 1/4 cup coconut manna and 4 cups water into a blender. Blend on high for 1-2 mins and keep milk in an air tight container in the fridge for up to 5 days.6. Baby Formula That ContainsCorn Syrup!Baby formula. I was so upset I gave my kids this after I read whats in it. ~ JenniferBaby formula. For some the first ingredient is high fructose corn syrup. Ugh ! ~ MaryBaby formula really made me angry when it had to become my daughters main source of food!! ~ KristaCorn Syrup in organic baby formula ~ CarolinaBaby formula! Poor little ones! The victims of industry. ~ AlleDomestic baby formula. After I stopped breastfeeding at six months I wanted to find an organic formula that was free from ingredients that I discovered infants should not ingest. I was disgusted by what was included in the ingredients  even organic formula. I now purchase a formula from the U.K. as they dont allow those same crap ingredients in baby formula. ~BeckyIts outrageous that mostconventional baby formulas in the store contain GMOs and milk from cows treated with antibiotics or artificial growth hormones. Even organic formulas arent perfect, and can containcarrageenan, synthetic preservatives, refined sugars with detectible levels of arsenic, and DHA extracted with hexane. As put in this guest post by Nutrition expert, Charlotte Vallaeys other options include donor milk and this recipe from the Weston A. Price Foundation.Better Store-Bought Alternative: Babys Only Organic Formula and HiPP Organic Formula.7. Canned Tuna That Has Hidden Soy (GMOs)!Canned tuna in water may contain soy. ~ JeanneSoy in cans of solid white albacore tuna. Wtf. ~ HillaryI cant believe gmo corn and soy is in everything!!! Please look at tuna. Why does it need soy? ~ ChristieTuna packed in waterwhich is actually broth, which contains soy! ~ DianeSoy in everything!! Even my tuna! WTH??? ~ LinzTuna is not a main staple in my diet because the practices largely used in the industry arent sustainable and are endangering marine species. Couple that with the fact thatmainstream tuna brands typically packtheir tunain a soy-based vegetable broth, and not actually in water like it says on the front of the can. If you like to occasionally eat tuna, seek out a brand from a sustainable fishery that uses pole & line (and troll-caught) fishing methods, preferably from North Americanwaters and packed without additives in BPA-free cans. When tuna are pole & line caughtthey are younger and much smaller, so they do not have the high mercury content that is found in most regular tuna.Better Store-Bought Alternative: American Tuna (brand)MSC Certified Sustainably Caught Albacore Tunaand Seafare Wild-Caught Tuna.8. Soda That Is Full Of Artificial Ingredients!Diet coke (and other diet sodas) being chemical nastiness in a can! Went cold turkey 4 years ago and havent been tempted once since that daywhen you know better, you do better ~ AndiGinger ale isnt really healthy..all pop (soft drinks) are just chemicals! ~ ElizabethAspartame will cause seizures in those prone to them. For me: No diet coke=no seizures. ~ AllisaI will also never regret the day I gave up diet coke!! ~ KatieI had a lightbulb moment about the huge bottles of diet coke Id drink daily. I had no idea that they were robbing me of my bone density. I quit that day and had another bone density test a few months later and it was amazingly wonderful. I never looked back.~ ChrisMine was when I saw the womens heart association label on Diet Coke cans several years ago. Made me think thats like cigarette companies putting lung association labels on the package. Food/ drinks that come with warnings of what it contains.like gum, diet pop .fair warning..its toxic. ~ BethAspartame. I use to be obsessed with diet coke and thought I was making a better choice cuz it was diet ~ DeneanHansens natural sodas containing artificial sweeteners in the diet varieties. ~ AmberIt wasnt what I read on a label, but giving up sodas has been an eye opening experience. I get full faster and I have no sugar cravings any more. Although I was drinking diet sodas I am amazed at how that crap was influencing my diet. ~ LaurieBoiling soda just once. Never drink another one. ~ ThomasYears ago when I worked in a marine store and sold Fozz, which is used to remove rust from metal. Then reading the ingredients in Coca Cola, which has the same ingredient: phosphoric acid! I stopped drinking soda from then. ~ MaggieA common ingredient in regularsodais high fructose corn syrup, which has been shown to be processed by your body differently than regular cane sugar. According to a 2007 study, high fructose corn syrup containsastonishingly high levels of reactive carbonyls, which are not present in table sugar, and these carbonyls are believed to cause tissue damage, and may contribute to the development of diabetes.Even more disgusting is the use of chemical artificial sweeteners (like aspartame and sucralose) in diet drinks, as these have been shownto stimulate your appetite, increase carbohydrate cravings, and promote weight gain.Better Alternatives:Homemade REAL Ginger-Ale,homemade iced tea or Kombucha.9. Very Controversial Ingredients That Are In Cereal!Aspartame in Fiber One cereal ~ EricaBHT in so many cereals ~ JennyI started noticing BHA & BHT in the kids cereal and various other foods and looked it up. I found out they are carcinogens and banned in just about every country but ours. ~ MichelleBreakfast cereals.BHT, sugar, preservativesand many more. GROSS ~ RachelKashi cereal. Wondered what was on it to keep you full. First ingredient is soy. Now what to do with boxes i have.  throw away or donate and let this poison feed someone else? I think i just answered my own question ~ RochelleThe amount of sugar in cereals I thought were healthy, & serving to my kids! ~ TraciPaint thinner in childrens cereal ~ KimTSP in cereal! ~ MichelleLife cereal has RED FOOD DYE? ~ HeatherSeeing BHT in almost all cereals. What? WHY? ~ Don and JenSix different names for sugar (sucrose) in the ingredients list for a cereal, to hide the fact the main ingredient is SUGAR. ~ EmiliaFiber One original cereal. I just couldnt believe I ate that junk for so many years almost daily with skim cow milk. Now I read the ingredients in all their new products and just hope nobody buys them. ~ JeezusTo think that this childhood morning staple is loaded with artificial colors, GMOs, preservatives, refined grains and sugar, makes me sick. One of the worst ingredients in many cereals is the preservativeBHT (butylated hydroxytoluene). Its a knownhuman allergen that has also caused tumor growth in animal studies. Due to serious health concerns,its been banned or restricted in several countries, yet itswidely used incereals here in the U.S.Better Alternatives: Oatmeal, Parfait Porridge,Two Moms In The RawPlain Grain Free Cereal (gluten-free), Homemade Granola,Ezekiel 4:9 Sprouted Whole Grain Cereal& Qia from Natures Path.10. Juice That Is Full of Junk!My 9 year old went from a juicebox a day to water. She sometimes asks for juice but when I look at the ingredients i put it right back. ~ AnaCorn syrup!! They put this in juices. Lol. ~ LorraineNaked juice, just crushed! ~ TawnyPasteurization kills all the benefits of orange juice and real fruit juice :( ~ CarolNatural Flavoring = corn and/or corn derivative to which I am highly allergic. I am not allergic to apples or cranberries; however, I had to take a Benadryl after drinking Motts-advertised and Ocean Spray-advertised 100% pure juices. I reported this to the FDA requesting that these juice companies cease advertising their juices as 100% pure. ~ DianeMost orange juices now have natural flavors! That is just crap! We dont need this crap in our orange juice! ~ NanNaked juice Something thats supposed to be great for you is full of junk. ~ KateAll the crap in kids juice drinks. ~ HeatherMost of the juice at the store is just glorified sugar water. Theyre oftenmade from concentrates, which means that the fresh juice has been heated down to syrup and reconstituted with water. During the concentration process, natural nutrients and flavors are lost, so they add those back in artificially. Even 100% Juice often contains proprietarynatural flavors that may be derived from anything natural, including animals. The juice is then heated up a second time to be pasteurized, which also denatures enzymes and destroys nutrients. So, after all that processing,its really not worth the money.

CONFIRMED! Lab tests show over 30+ popular food products contain GMOs. Are you eating them?,http://foodbabe.com/2014/10/10/confirmed-lab-tests-show-over-30-popular-food-products-contain-gmos-are-you-eating-them/,"This week headlines about GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) splashed all over major media outletsacross the country. This media firestorm was in response to a new report released by Consumer Reports regarding GMOs in American food products. This report finally shared what I have thought all along: Non-labeled food products most likely contain GMOs if the ingredients include a corn or soy byproduct.Before I get into the shocking results of the report, I want to share with you why I personally try to avoid GMOs in my diet:There are no mandatory safety assessments required before GMOs are introduced into our food system.GMOs have contributed to more toxic pesticide usage since their inception. I want the pollution of our earth to stop. The types of environmental chemicals we are being exposed to are what the Presidents Cancer Panel says will destine 41% of us to get cancer in our lifetime.There areno long term human studies to prove GMOs are safe.GMOs are responsible for killing beecolonies. Without bees, we are in big trouble.I could go on with more reasons, but one in particular is very personal. I used tosuffer from some of the worst allergies. I have been hospitalized multiple times because of them. I used to be on several prescription drugs to control them too. When I removed GMOs from my diet, eating a majority of organic whole, unprocessed foods, my allergies vanished and was able to stop taking all myprescription medications. I feel like I have ten times more energy now and feel incredible. For this reason alone, I take avoiding GMOs very seriously.GMOs are running rampant in our food supply Earlier this year, the Consumer Reports Food Safety and Sustainability Center sent out secret shoppers to purchase more than 80 processed food products in New York and Seattle, which includeda wide range of products all containing corn or soy ingredients: breakfast cereals, bars, corn chips, corn tortillas, baking mixes and flours, baby formulas, meat substitutes, soy dairy products, and tofu/tempeh products. Then, theytestedthese productsto see if they contained any GMOingredients, and if so, how much. This is important because the overwhelming majority of processed food in America contains corn orsoy ingredients, which are also the most prevalent genetically modified crops, yet most major food manufacturers are strongly against labeling GMO ingredients. We are being left in the dark in this country, and virtually theonly way to know whether a product contains GMOs is to have it tested  and thats exactly what Consumer Reports did. What I love abouttheir reportis that Consumer Reports essentially just slapped a big fat GMO label on a few dozeneveryday food products here in America, including many that are considered Natural and healthy. The manufacturers of these foods do not want you to know that their products contain GMOs andhavecollectively spent millions of dollarsto fight against labeling laws, depriving us of our right to know. This is outrageous considering that92% of American consumers want GMO labels on foodand are becoming increasingly aware of how prevalent GMOshave become in our food supply.TheNatural Label: Its a sham.Consumer Reports tested several products thatare labeled as Natural because they found that the majority of Americans still believe that the Natural label means that they are non-GMO. AsIve written aboutin the past, the word Natural on a product means absolutely nothing in regards to GMOsthe FDA hasfailed to definethe use ofthis termwhich allows food manufacturers to deceptivelylabel their products as Natural to trickus into thinking their product is betterthan the others on the shelf. Consumer Reports notes that,Consumers who want to avoid GE ingredientsshould notrely on products labeled natural to avoid GMOs. This label is highly confusing and generallymisleading for consumers and Consumer Reports is asking the government to ban its useon food. They should because GMOsare not natural. As put by theInstitute for Responsible Technology: A GMO (genetically modified organism) is the result of a laboratory process where genes from the DNA of one species are extracted and artificially forced into the genes of an unrelated plant or animal. The foreign genes may come from bacteria, viruses, insects, animals or even humansWith genetic engineering, scientists can breach species barriers set up by nature. For example, they have spliced fish genes into tomatoes. The results are plants (or animals) with traits that would be virtually impossible to obtain with natural processes, such as crossbreeding or grafting.Yet, GMOsremain in Natural foods all over the country. Consumer Reports found that some Natural products contained similar amounts of GMOs as theircounterparts without a natural label. For instance, they found substantial quantities of GMO corn or GMO soy in popular Natural foods such as Kashi GoLean Honey & Cinnamon hot cereal (owned by Kelloggs),Utz All Natural Multigrain Tortillas, and Nature Valley Crunchy Oats N Honey Granola Bars (owned by General Mills).From Consumer Reports  Products guilty of using GMOs(A-Z):Betty Crocker Authentic Cornbread & Muffin MixBoca Original Vegan Veggie BurgersCorn Tortillas/Tortilla FlourDoritos Oven Baked Nacho CheeseEnfamil ProSobee Soy Infant FormulaGeneral Mills Cocoa PuffsGeneral Mills Corn ChexGeneral Mills KixGeneral Mills TrixGerber Good Start SoyJiffy Corn Muffin MixKashi GoLean (in the process ofof getting Non-GMO project verified)Kashi GoLean Hearty Honey & Cinnamon (Hot Cereal)Kelloggs Froot LoopsKelloggs Special K Protein Chocolatey Peanut Butter Granola Snack BarKrusteaz Natural Honey Cornbread & Muffin MixLa Banderita Corn TortillasMaseca Instant Corn Masa FlourMission White Corn TortillasMission Yellow Corn TortillasMorningStar Farms Chikn NuggetsMorningStar Farms Grillers California Turky BurgerNature Valley Crunchy Oats N Honey Granola BarsNature Valley Protein Peanut Butter Dark Chocolate Chewy BarNice!

Most disturbingly, all soy-based infant formulas they tested (thatare not labeled organic) are made with GMO soy, which includedEnfamil Prosobee, Gerber Good Start, Similac Go and Grow, and Similac Soy Isomil. If you are looking for the safest baby formula, be sure to check out this full investigation.Unverified Non-GMO claims: Dont fall for it.One of the most shocking things that Consumer Reports uncovered is thatXochitl Totopos de Maiz original corn chips (the non-organic variety) contain on averagemore than 75%GMO corn, although theyclaim right on the front of the bagthat they contain no GMOs. Consumer Reports tested 6 packages of non-organicXochitl chipsfrom different lots and found GMOs in every single one. These chips arentverified by the Non-GMO project, but theycontain the misleading statements All Natural and No GMO on the package. This just goes to show that becausethere are no regulations in place to ensure that non-verified claims can be trusted, the only way to be certain that youre avoiding GMOs is to look for the verified seal or 100% certified organic food. Most of theproducts that Consumer Reportstestedwithouta Non-GMO Project Verified or Certified Organic label contained GMO ingredients with few exceptions. Consumer Reportsconcluded that the USDA Organic and Non-GMO Project sealis reliable. This is why I do not purchase products that contain high-riskGMO ingredients without a 100% certified organic orNon-GMO Project Verified label. Tipsto use this information andavoid GMOs at the grocery store:Neverbuy products purely based onNaturalor100% All Naturallabel claims. Look for 100% Certified USDA Organic labels on food.Dont blindlytrust a non-GMO ingredient label claim that is not verified with aNon-GMO project seal or verification of 3rd party testing or certified organic. Read ingredient labels andwatch out for this list ofcommon GMO ingredients, particularlyanything derived from corn, soy, canola, cottonseed, sugar beets, papaya, zucchini and squash.Do not buy any products thatConsumer Reports verified contains GMOs(see the complete list fromtheir reportabove).Consumer Reports supports mandatory GMO labelingDespite this consumer demand, there are no requirements for labeling genetically engineeredingredients in processed foods and there is extremely limited safety testing required. Without labeling, there is a lack of transparency in the marketplace and Consumers Union, the policy and advocacy arm of Consumer Reports, is actively engaged in a campaign to have foods with GE ingredients (also known as Genetically Modified Organisms or GMOs) labeled. In the meantime, consumers are unable to make informed purchasing decisions.Consumer Reports dispel many of the myths (and lies) circulating about GMOs, such as:GMOs arenecessary to feed the world(FALSE)it is interesting to note that the world already produces more than enough food to feed all its inhabitants. Hunger, whether in the US and or other parts of the world, is not caused by an insufficient quantity of food being grown. Rather it is caused by disparities in wealth, waste, wars, and market inefficienciesLooking at the long term outlook, GE foods may actually threaten food availability and increase food costs.GMOs are required to undergo pre-market safety testing by the FDA(FALSE)FDA, which regulates food safety, does not require any safety assessment of the GE crops, but invites companies to provide data for a voluntary safety review. This is in contrast to other major economies such as European Union, Australia, Japan, and China, which all require that a premarket mandatory safety assessment of GE crops is conductedGMOs are safe for the environment (FALSE)GE crops can have a significant negative impact on the environment. Although the industry often claims that GE crops reduce pesticide use, in fact the opposite istrueThe vast increase in herbicide use, especially glyphosate (trade name RoundUp), has caused weeds to become resistant to them, and this chemical is losing its effectivenessIn addition, studies suggest that glyphosate-tolerant crops and the use of glyphosate are likely more responsible for the large decline in monarch butterfly populations than are declines in the overwintering habitat in Mexico, since this herbicide use is wiping out most of the milkweed, which the Monarch butterfly depends on for food.GMOs have been proven safe to eat (FALSE)There is global scientific agreement that genetic engineering has the potential to introduce allergens and toxins in food crops, to change the nutritional value, and to create other unintended changes that may affect human health.The tide is beginning to turn in this country  I can feel it! The more knowledgeable we become about the use of GMOs in our food, the more quickly we will get transparency. When we voice our opinion to these companies, they have proven time and again that they are willing to change  and they have. Consumer Reports noted that,between testing and publishing of this report, that there were manufacturers who were obtaining or obtained Non-GMO Project Verified certification. This demonstrates an actively changing market that seems to be respondingto consumer demand. There are few things you can do to help keep this moving in the right direction:If you live in Oregon or Colorado, cast your vote in favor of GMO labeling this November. More information can be found on the Oregon Right to Know and the Colorado Right to Know websites.If you know someone who lives in Oregon or Colorado, call them, facebook them, tweet them or go visit them and ask them to cast their vote in favor of GMO labeling.If you live elsewhere, contact your state legislators and tell them you support mandatory labeling of GMO food.Join the Food Babe Army here its completely free and youll be the first to know about any new investigations.Spread the word bysharing this post with everyone you know.Thank you for your commitment to a more transparent food system.We have the right to know what we are eating!Vani105K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

You’ll Never Guess What’s In A Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte (Hint: You Won’t Be Happy),http://foodbabe.com/2014/08/25/starbucks-pumpkin-spice-latte/,"Updated 4/6/2015 (see bottom of post)I really love the smell of pumpkin (especially in the Fall), but, there is at least one seasonal pumpkin treat that I will never order and thats the StarbucksPumpkin Spice Latte. Withmore than 200 million sold to date, these drinks sell like hotcakes this time of year, andStarbucks CEO Howard Schultz saidit still ranks as its most popular seasonal beverage.But, does anyone know whats really in it?I found out, and Im going to break it all down for you here. But first, I want to mention that I get riled up when restaurants refuse todisclose their ingredients, because we have the right to know whatwe are eating and drinking. Ive tried for years to get ingredient information from Starbucks and its been a bit frustrating to say the least. If youve ever tried emailing their customer service for ingredients you probably know what Im talking about.This week, we emailed them asking for the complete list of ingredients in the Pumpkin Spice Latte and this was their response:The Pumpkin Spice Latte is of pumpkin and traditional fall spiceflavors combined with espresso and steamed milk, topped with whippedcream and pumpkin pie spice. If you ever have any questions or concerns in the future, please donthesitate to get in touch.After severalmore emails back and forth, they were still refusingto share the ingredients:While we understand that some customers would like to know the nutrition information for their specific customized beverage, unfortunately we are unable to provide this level of detail for every beverage customization request. The beverage information that is available on Starbucks.com reflects the beverage offerings currently on our menu with the most common customization options. For a company that prides itself in its transparency, its unbelievable to me that this is how they respond to customers who ask for information about whats in their drinks. After really putting the pressure on, I was finally able to get the complete list, but it wasnt easy. While theylist some ingredients on their website, they still do not list the ingredientsin their most popular items: their drinks! This includes all of their lattes, frappuccinos, macchiatos, smoothies, etc. Starbucks doesnteven publish the ingredients in their Kids Drinks keeping parents completely in the dark. If you have a food allergy, their allergen information isnt available online either.Hows that for transparency?Besides trying to get an employeeto spill the beans, pretty much the onlyway to getthe ingredients in their drinksis to go into their online store and search for each of the individual components that make up these drinks, but they are not all listed here. Quite frankly, this is a pain. This also requires you to know all of the components that make up the drink that you order. For instance, the Pumpkin Spice Latte isnt just espresso, syrup and milk. If you order it the usual way onthe menu, it contains espresso, pumpkin sauce, steamed milk (or soy milk), whipped cream and spice topping  and these each come with their own ingredient list. Another way to get ingredients is to email andcall customer service, or to ask a corporate contact at Starbucks (if youre lucky enough to know one like me). We used all of these avenues to get the ingredients in this drink, and you know what? We got different ingredients.Overall, the ingredients were similar, but there were slight differences. We initially called Starbucks customer service and they said that all of the syrups sold in theironline store are the same ones that are used in the restaurant, and that specificallythe Pumpkin Sauce is the same. The online version heresays Pumpkin Saucecontains high fructose corn syrup. They also divulged the ingredients in the whipped cream, spice topping, and soy milk. Shortly thereafter, we also received a response to our email inquiry and this is when things became shady.This timethe ingredient list they sent over didnt have anyhigh fructose corn syrup on it. Rather, it was replaced with sweetened condensed nonfat milk. After a couple email exchanges, they seemed to confirm that HFCS is an ingredient:Yes the sauce that we sell online at www.starbucks.com is that same sauce that we use in our stores. I understand you concerns about high fructose corn syrup being used in the Sweentened Condensed Nonfat Milk. Please be aware that product information is provided to us by the suppliers who manufacture food and beverage items for Starbucks Coffee Company. Variations may exist due to periodic changes in formulations. While we attempt to provide product information that is as complete as possible, product changes or new product introductions may cause this information to become outdated or incomplete. Products may vary from location to location.I wasnt done yet. I also contacted a PR rep at Starbucks whom I had been in contact with previously and asked her to send me the ingredients. According to her, The condensed milk is sweetened with sugar (no HFCS).As you can see, this makes for a very confusing customer experience, and I still dont really know if it contains high fructose corn syrup (or not).Why wont they just publish ingredients online and end the confusion?They obviously know what the ingredients are in each of their drinks, so I seeno reason for them to hold back frompublishing them (in their entirety) online just like they do for their food items. This would make it easy for their customers to know exactly what they are drinking. I believe the reason that theyre dragging their feet is because they dont want you to know about the harmful additives in their biggest selling items.Case In Point: Youll get 2 doses of Class IV Caramel Coloring in Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte.Youve probably heard me talk about caramel coloring before, and thats because I think its one of the mosthazardouschemicals being added to our food. Although it sounds harmless, food safety and consumer watch dog groups say it is not. There are fourdifferent types (classes) of caramel coloring and twoof those types contain the dangerous substance4-methylimidazole (4-Mel). Starbucks uses Class IV Caramel Color, considered the most harmful typethat contains 4-Mel,in many of their drink syrups and sauces. Its even in their whipped cream! Why Starbucks should stop using Class IV Caramel Coloring immediately:Its created in a laboratoryby reacting corn sugar with ammonia and sulfites under high pressure and temperature, which produces the byproduct4-Mel.A U.S government funded study found that feeding mice caramel coloring IV (which contained 4-Mel)increased their risk of developinglung cancer and leukemia,at every dosage level.The International Agency for Research on Cancerclassifies4-Mel aspossibly carcinogenic to humans.Any food or drink thatcontains more than 29 micrograms of 4-Melrequires a cancerwarning label In California (under Prop 65) that says, WARNING: This product contains a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer.The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) petitioned the FDA to bancaramel coloring in 2011 due to safety concerns and the cancer risk of allowing this ingredient in our food.It has no nutritional benefits and is only used cosmetically to improve the appearance of food and drinks, yet thereare safer alternatives available to food manufacturers.Its sometimesadded unnecessarily to food and drinks that are naturally brown or that are not even visible to the consumer (e.g. baby vitamin drops).Its the most widely used food coloring in the world, which makes it easy to consume excessive amounts.Thankfully, the FDA iscurrently reviewingitssafetyand GRAS status,due to aConsumer Reports studythat found excessive levels in many popular drinks.In previous correspondence with Starbucks, they told me they have no plans to remove the ingredient and, in all instances where the color is used in our beverages, the level is well below the No Significant Risk Level (NSRL) allowed by Californias Prop 65, regarded as a conservative evaluation system, and safe to consume. I havent seen any testing results that show the exact levels of 4-Mel found in Starbucks drinks, so we just have to take their word for it on this one. Also, even if the level is below whats allowed, what if someone has a Vente (Starbucks largest size) with the double dose of caramel coloring within the syrup and whipcream  whats the amount of caramel coloring then? Even if the levelsare below whats permitted in California, its still not safe. In the opinion of toxicologist Dr. UrvashiRangan, There is nosafe level of 4-MeI, but if youhave set athreshold, it shouldbe well below the Prop 65 level (29 micrograms/day)  and more like3 micrograms/day.Roasted coffee itself has been shown to contain trace amounts of 4-Mel. Couple that with the fact that this coloring is in just about every processed food you can imagine, so you may be cumulativelyeating more of this stuff than you realize  and no amount is safe. Would you really care if the syrup and sauces that they squirt into your coffee are colored brown? Its going into brown coffeeanyhow. its totally ridiculous to me that caramel coloring is even considered a necessary ingredient and that Starbucks doesnt ask their suppliers to completely remove it.Wheres the pumpkin?After reading the ingredients in the Pumpkin Spice Latte, I can tell you thattheresabsolutely no pumpkin. Instead, youll be drinking this:A Huge Dose of Sugar  A lot of it. Order up a non-fat grande and youll get served 50 grams of sugar. Is it apick-me-up from the caffeine, or all that toxic sugar?MonsantoMilk Even though over a hundred thousand customers are demanding it, Starbucks refuses to serve organic milk (at alllocations). Due to consumer pressure, they stopped using milk from cows injected with growth hormones several years ago, but their milk still comes from cows that are fed genetically modifiedfeed all day long  which is really supporting Monsanto and the biotech companies. When cows survive primarilyon acheap grain diet (corn, soy, alfalfa, cotton)its bad for the health of the animals, which is contributing to the overuse of antibioticsand the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. If they made the switch to organic milk, or even offered it for that matter, it would ensure that it didnt come from cows grazing on GMO grains or injected with antibiotics.Pesticide Residue Starbucks doesnt serve organic coffee in most locations. Non-organic coffee is considered one of the heaviest chemically treated crops in the world, especially whenitsimportedfrom developing nations that allow pesticides that arerestrictedin the U.S. due to health concerns, such asChlorpyrifos.Natural and Artificial Flavors  Since this drink contains absolutely no pumpkin, this is where all that flavor comes from. The problem with both artificial and natural flavors is that their sources are proprietary and you never really know what they are made from.Preservativesand Sulfites  Which may cause allergic reactions orasthmaattacks, and is linked with DNA damage.If youre vegan, I have a specific warning for you.Many of you may beshocked to find out that whenyou order a Pumpkin Spice lattewith soy milk, its still not vegan. This is because the Pumpkin Sauce contains condensed nonfat milk, and many Starbucks employees dont realize this and have misinformed customers. This is yet another reason that Starbucks Corporate should be transparent about whats in their drinksby publishing complete ingredientsonline.Youll also get more than you bargained for if you order up a soy latte, because the Starbucks proprietary organic soy milk contains carrageenan  which is linked to gastrointestinal inflammation and cancer. It also contains another dose of addedsugar, preservatives and natural flavors.Complete Ingredients in Starbucks Pumpkin Spice Latte:Milk, Espresso (Water, Brewed Espresso Coffee), Pumpkin Spice Flavored Sauce (Sugar, Condensed Nonfat Milk, High Fructose Corn Syrup or Sweetened Condensed Nonfat Milk (Milk, Sugar), Annatto (for color), Natural and Artificial Flavors, Caramel Color (class IV), Salt, Potassium Sorbate (preservative)),Whip Cream(Whipping Cream, Starbucks Vanilla Syrup (Sugar, Water, Natural Flavors, Potassium Sorbate, Citric Acid, Caramel Color (class IV)),Pumpkin Spice Topping: Cinnamon, Ginger, Nutmeg, Clove, Sulfites.SOY OPTION:Starbucks Organic Soy Milk (plain):Filtered Water, Organic Whole Soybeans, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Calcium Carbonate, Organic Vanilla Flavor, Natural Flavors, Sea Salt, Carrageenan, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Bicarbonate, Vitamin A Palmitate, Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin), Vitamin B12, Zinc Gluconate.Starbucks Organic Soy Milk (vanilla): Filtered Water, Organic Whole Soybeans, Organic Evaporated Cane Juice, Calcium Carbonate, Natural Vanilla Flavors, Natural Flavors, Sea Salt, Carrageenan, Sodium Citrate, Sodium Bicarbonate, Vitamin A Palmitate, Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin), Vitamin B12.Ditch the Starbucks and Drink This Instead!Mama Natural has a version of ahomemade pumpkin spice lattethat actually uses real pumpkin!

The more people that know the truth, the more Starbucks will be forced to make a change.Thank you for your activism and spreading the word in advance. Together we can change the food system. Hopefully in the near future, we can have treats like these without worrying about the toxic chemicals in them!Xo,VaniUpdate 4/6/2015: I received an email from Starbucks representatives that they have started to remove caramel coloring level IV. we recently transitioned the vanilla syrup in our US and Canada stores to a new formula which is free from caramel coloring. We prioritized vanilla as it is an ingredient in our whipped cream, so with this one change we removed caramel coloring from many beverages. We are actively working on the rest and dont have a specific timeline to share at this time.

"What To Bring On Your Flight, So You Never Get Stuck Eating Airport Food Ever Again!",http://foodbabe.com/2014/06/27/healthy-airport-food/,"If you know me, you know I love to travel, but theres one thing about travel that gets me worked up every time. There are millionsof people coming in and out of the airports across the world thinking they have no choice. They think theyhave to eat airport and airplane food because its the only thing available. They let their surroundings control their lives, their health, and the health of their families. I used to be one of these people. For years, I traveled for work, consulting at major financial institutions all over the United States going from city to city. I didnt know anything about the food I was eating and I felt terrible about myself  I was overweight, felt tired all of the time, my skin was a mess, and I was generally less productive. This is why I feel obligated to share the information I learned that changed my life forever. I cant just sit back and let this happen for so many people.This madness needs to stop. We have a choice! We are in control of everything we put in our mouths! Our bodies arenot trashcans for the industrial food system!Bring food with you to the airport & on airplanes!Im happy to say that I havent had to eat airport and airplane food in a long time. Airplane food is oftenheavily processed with tons of controversial additives and preservatives that dont fit into my healthy lifestyle. On my last flight, I posted some pictures of what I was eating and drinking on my Facebook page, and got a lot of questions. Many of you are wondering how I was able to bring my own food on board and wanted details. Its easy to do, but it does take a bit of prep time and you have to make sure that what you bring wont get confiscated by the TSA at the security checkpoint.TSA lets you bring food through security.In the United States and in most countries, the transit authorities allows you to bring food through the security screening and onboard. Here are some items that work well and dont get confiscated:Homemade sandwiches wrapped in parchment paper stored in a quart-sized plastic bag. Keep in mind that all food that you carry on will need to go through the x-ray machine at the checkpoint. So, never use any foil. They will want to search your bag and delay your travels.Dips and sauces, such as hummus, salsa and almond butter, as long as it is in a 3.4 oz (or smaller) container, and put into a quart-sized plastic bag.Fresh fruits and veggies, such as apples, bananas and avocados. Just wash them at home or in your hotel room before you put them in your bag. If you cut or peel them ahead of time, of course they need to be wrapped in a plastic bagor put in a glass container. Keep in mind that you can also bring a butter knife to slice ripe avocados and bananas on the plane.Crunchy snacks such as crackers, popcorn, kale chips, etc.Dried fruit and raw nuts make a great snack on the plane. I like to make my own mix  1/2 cup each of raw almonds, coconut flakes, dried cherries or raisins, and raw walnuts. The airport usually has trail mix, but it comes loaded with inflammatory oils, other additives and are usually not raw or organic.Pre-made salads in glass containersor BPA-free plastic. Salad dressing can be packed separately as long as its in a 3.4 oz. or smaller container. However, I find that its easier to bring it already mixed into a salad or at the bottom of the bowl for mixing in later. (Just dont forget to bring a fork!)Empty thermos and empty water bottles  any size. These are great for filling up after you get through security.Tea bags for making hot tea in the airport before you board. Dont use the hot water on the airplane. Its not as clean as you would like, try to get it from a cafe in the airport before boarding.If you are traveling with your child: baby food, breast milk and formula are exempt from the 3.4 oz. rule and you can bring those on the plane in any quantity needed. Green juice in mini ball jar containers packed in a cooler to stay fresh.In addition to this list  Check out this app on the TSA website to search for what items may (or may not be) currently allowed in your carry-on. Tips for packing your carry-on bag:Most people dont think about this, but you can pack a cooler as one of your carry-on bags. There are some great travel coolers available, and even some that are on wheels that easily go through security for long flights or if you are traveling with family. Just make sure that it meets thesize requirements for the airline that you are flying on. These are two of my favorites:eBags Crew Cooler  Designed to fit over your carry on luggage as your second bag and comes in many different colors. Perfect for in-flight food.Available on Amazon for ~$49 here.Coleman Wheeled Travel Cooler  This cooler has a hard plastic liner, which is good for either taking as your carry-on bag orchecking in with your luggage at the airport. Available on Amazon for ~$41.23 here.I drink a lot of water, especially when traveling. Try packing a large empty water bottle and fill it up after going through security. Make sure you fill it up before you get on the plane, becauseIve found that some airlines wont do it for you.Pack an extra empty plastic bag and fill it with ice from a restaurant after you get through security to keep your cooler cold. Ive never had a problem asking for free ice, they will gladly provide it. Some airports have food courts, where you can just help yourself too.I personally havent had any trouble bringing in frozen gel ice packs, so you can try it  but there is a possibility that they would be confiscated. So, an extra bag for ice is a good back up plan.For longer flights, pack some frozen food in your cooler. If you pack some frozen berries or yogurt in small containers, it will help to keep your cooler cool and slowly defrost during your flight.If you find yourself in a bind or didnt have time to pack food, dont worry. There is fresh food available if you look for it. Many airports have a Jamba Juice, where you can pick up wheatgrass shots and some juice bars even offer fresh squeezed green juice or cold pressed juice in bottles (Yeah! San Fran airport!). You can always find fresh fruits (bananas, apples) and raw unsalted almonds in a store or restaurant at the airport. Check out this Farmers Market stand with plenty of real food options I found in terminal E of the Charlotte Airport:I have anextensive list hereof easy to pack snack foods that you can easily toss in your bag and take through security.If you are traveling internationally, only bring enough food for your flight in your carry-on because you will likely need to throw away any leftover food when you arrive at customs in your destination country. Before you leave, reviewthecustoms restrictions for your destination, to see what you may be able to bring into the country you are visiting.I like to fill my thermos with about 3 inches of slicedraw ginger before packing it in my carry-on bag. After you go through security, fill it up with hot water from a restaurant and youve got hot ginger tea for your flight! Ginger tea improves circulation, reduces inflammation, and is antibacterial  everything you need on a flight. Ive been using the Think Sport insulated bottles  which come in two sizes for my tea. They are available herewith 10% off affiliate code: FOODBABE10 if youd like to get one!    4.7 from 13 reviews   Food Babe's In Flight Ginger Tea     Print     Prep time  2 mins    Total time  2 mins      Serves: 1   Ingredients  3 inch piece of ginger root Empty insulated water bottle like ThinkSport     Instructions  Wash, peel and slice ginger root Place ginger root in an empty insulated bottle Fill with hot water after going through security - any cafe will gladly do this for free or sometimes for a dollar.

Please choose organic ingredients when possible.   3.2.2708 Recipes that travel well for your flight:Salads  Thesepack well, especially if they have some grains in them such as quinoa to help keep the greens from getting wilted. When packing a basic salad, layer the salad in a glass container with the dressing on the bottom, followed by the grains, and then layer the greens on top. Just stir it up on the plane right before eating. Of course, this will need to be packed in a cooler with some ice to keep it from going bad if you dont eat it right away.

Healthy Holiday Granola {Perfect For Anytime Of The Year!},http://foodbabe.com/2013/12/17/healthygranola/,"Im so excited to share the healthy holiday granola I am giving to friends and family this season! (If you are my friend or family member that is going to get one of these  sorry for ruining the surprise!) This granola makes the perfect breakfast to replace cereal or snack and/or holiday gift. I used my basic recipe for granola but purposely chose pistachios and red dried fruits like cherries, goji berries and cranberries for the ingredients to create a festive look.This granola recipe is really perfect to make anytime of year  not just the holidays and sure does beat the overly processed kind you buy at the grocery store that is full of refined sugar, inflammatory oils, and added artificial or natural flavoring.To create the gift containers, I used leftover Lunas Living Kitchen Juice Glass Jars and brushed off the glue gun to glue some pretty ribbon around the bottles to cover up their logo. I could have easily bought inexpensive mason jars, but was looking forward to reusing these all year long  I drink A LOT of their organic raw juice! I still have many jars left that I havent used and plan to use them all year round (think baby showers, bridal showers, kids parties, etc all you need to do is change the ribbon and out comes the perfect party favor!)Word to the wise: Make sure you add dried fruit in after baking, this will keep them from drying out too much, keeping them yummy and chewy. This is especially true for goji berries.    4.9 from 13 reviews   Food Babe's Healthy Holiday Granola     Print     Prep time  5 mins    Cook time  60 mins    Total time  1 hour 5 mins      Serves: 10   Ingredients  3 cups rolled oats 2 cups of raw nuts of your choice (I used pistachios and almonds)  cup shredded unsweetened coconut 1 tbsp vanilla  cup coconut oil melted  cup maple syrup  teaspoon sea salt 2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice or cinnamon  cup dried cherries, goji berries or cranberries     Instructions  Preheat oven to 250 degrees Combine all ingredients except for dried fruit and mix well Place mixture on a large baking sheet lined with parchment paper Bake for 1 hour (stirring every 20 mins so all sides evenly brown) Remove granola from oven and let cool Stir in dried fruit Store in an airtight container for up to 2 weeks     Notes ***Please choose all organic ingredients if possible***   3.2.2124 Hope you share this recipe with friends and family this holiday season and all year round Cheers!

How To Find the Safest Organic Infant Formula,http://foodbabe.com/2013/05/28/how-to-find-the-safest-organic-infant-formula/,"I am honored to share this guest post by Charlotte Vallaeys, former of Director of Farm and Food Policy at the Cornucopia Instituteand now a Senior Analyst within theConsumer Safety and Sustainability Programat Consumers Union. This isthe truth about organic infant formulas that currentlyexiston the market today and something that needs to be read by every mother-to-be, mothers and fathers everywhere.Unfortunately, choosing an infant formula that is organic is not enough  you must look deeper and understand the ingredients manufacturers are using in their products. Charlotte shares the exact ingredients you need to look out for and how to find the safest organic infant formula available. She holds Masters degrees from Harvard University and Tufts Universitys Friedman School of Nutrition.Some of my favorite memories of my sons as babies (which was not that long agothey are 2 and 4 years old) involve breastfeeding. It is a truly magical and priceless bonding experience. And for someone who loves good, real food as much as I do, there could be nothing more satisfying and empowering than that tingling feeling that accompanies the milk ducts springing into action to produce fresh milk, full of just the right mix of enzymes, nutrients, antibodies, hormones, and other beneficial components that have yet to be discoveredthe product of millions of years of evolution, specially made for my baby to ensure hell grow and thrive.But we also faced many obstacles along the way. The challenges started in the hospital with my firstborn and continued up to the moment my lastborn sipped his last drop of human milk.My oldest, Liam, would not latch on at first. I had expected breastfeeding to be easyit was, after all, so naturalbut there I was, a brand new mom with an hours-old baby, struggling to get my newborn to latch on. Those first hours of motherhood ushered in the realization that, in parenthood, not everything will go as planned.After involving many contraptions, including a hospital-grade breast pump, specialized bottles, and a silicone nipple shield, and many different nurses and lactation consultants advice (not to mention a lot of maternal determination), we finallyafter a couple of daysmade it work.When Liam was 9 weeks old, I discovered blood in his diaper and disregarded our pediatricians advice to switch from breastfeeding to hypoallergenic formula (she claimed he was allergic to milk, including his mothers milk). Instead, I continued breastfeeding but cut all dairy and soy out of my diet until Liams first birthday.Among other challenges, we weathered two bouts of painful mastitis and many days of separation for work-related trips that required a freezer full of pumped milk.The challenges continued until the very end, and unfortunately, my final memories of breastfeeding are also the most painful. When he was 9 months, my second son, Kai, decided to wean on his own. I had heard about self-weaning, and until I was faced with an uninterested and stubborn infant, I thought it was just a clever excuse for mothers to switch to more convenient formula feeding. Again, it was a stark reminder that many things about parenthood are easier said than done, and so much of what happens on this journey is entirely out of our control.I suppose I was more stubborn than Kai, and he eventually became hungry and thirsty enough that he would feed. But he responded by reluctantly drinking and then ending the session with a bite. After a couple of weeks of very tenseand often painfulfeeding sessions, I switched to pumping and giving my milk to Kai from a bottle. I grimaced every time I saw him bite down on that rubber nipple. Eventually, after a couple more weeks, I produced no more milk, and that bottle needed something in it for the remaining weeks until we could switch to organic whole milk.All this baby-feeding drama happened while I worked as a researcher and policy analyst with The Cornucopia Institute. Cornucopia acts as a watchdog for the organic community. As I carefully read labels in the baby food aisle of my local food store, I couldnt help but notice numerous violations of the organic standards. I avoided these baby foods with multiple unapproved synthetic ingredients. Meanwhile, Cornucopia took a leading role in advocating for the removal of unnecessary or potentially harmful synthetics from organic formula and baby food.This blog post is for parents, grandparents and others who want more information on organic infant formula. Id like to share what I learned both as Policy Director at Cornucopia and as a mom looking for the best food for my own babies.Without a doubt, human milk and factory-produced infant formula dont compare, as human milk is far superior in so many respects, including in ways we will probably never fully comprehend. We can all agree on that. But in parenthood, many things dont go as planned, and for many committed, food-conscious, organic-buying parents, that includes breastfeeding.I will only cover organic formula, and I hope that readers will understand that while there are many problems in this segment of the organic industry, organic formula is still a far better choice than conventional formula, with its genetically engineered ingredients (GMOs), milk from cows that were likely treated with antibiotics or artificial growth hormones, and oils that were processed with the use of neurotoxic solvents like hexane. Major ingredients in conventional formula are derived from crops that were sprayed with harmful pesticides and herbicides in the field and likely fumigated in storage.Organic formula offers an alternative, but it is far from perfect. I hope that parents will find the information here useful if faced with the tough decision to turn to formula. The Organic Formula IndustryIf you need formula and cant make your own, you likely want to know how to purchase the best one.While there are seven brands of organic infant formula currently available on market shelves, there are only three companies that make organic infant formula in the United States.One manufacturer is PBM Nutritionals, owned by Perrigo. At $3 billion in annual sales, Perrigo is the worlds largest manufacturer of private label (store-brand) over-the-counter pharmaceuticals. PBM primarily produces conventional formula, but makes organic formula for its own Vermont Organics and Bright Beginnings brands. It also manufacturers organic formula for Hain Celestials Earths Best brand, Whole Foods Markets 365 Organic brand, and Walmarts Parents Choice brand.Similac Organic is manufactured by Abbott Laboratories. Abbott, a major manufacturer of pharmaceuticals in the U.S., introduced Similac Organic in 2006. By 2007, its first full year on sale, Similac Organic captured 36% of the organic formula market. Abbotts Similac is a market leader in conventional formula.Finally, Babys Only Organic is developed and marketed by Natures One. Natures One markets Babys Only Organic formula as a toddler formula rather than an infant formula (according to the company, this is done to encourage breastfeeding until age 1). Its products meet the same nutritional standards that the FDA sets forth for infant formula. Natures One is the only company marketing organic formula that is not a publicly traded corporation; the business is family-owned and operated.Top five ingredients to take a close look at  how do organic brands compare?1. Sweeteners: corn syrup, sugar, or brown rice syrupFormula manufacturers strive to formulate a product that mirrors the nutritional profile of human milk. Human milk contains higher levels of lactose, a carbohydrate, than cow milk, which means that formula manufacturers must make up the difference by adding a sweetener to cow milk-based formula.But in their choice of sweetener, it appears that concerns over the availability and price of the various sources have taken precedence. The sweetener that most closely mimics human milk would be lactose (the naturally occurring carbohydrate in any mammals milk). But lactose is also the most expensive, and manufacturers have, over the years, switched from this milk-based sweetener to plant-based sweeteners.Corn syrupWhen PBM Nutritionals first rolled out its organic infant formula under the Bright Beginnings brand name, it contained only organic lactose, with no corn-based sweeteners. PBM soon produced the same product for Walmart, under the Parents Choice brand name, which also contained only organic lactose.But PBM Nutritionals switched from organic lactose as the sole sweetener for Bright Beginnings, and so did Walmarts organic formula, in 2010. Their formulations changed to include both organic corn syrup solids and lactose.By 2011, organic lactose in Bright Beginnings and Parents Choice had disappeared altogether, replaced by organic maltodextrin, another plant-based sweetener. Maltodextrins are partially hydrolyzed starch molecules, which can be derived from corn, rice or potatoes. Maltodextrin is less sweet than corn syrup.Today, Bright Beginnings, Parents Choice and Whole Foods 365 Organic contain no organic lactose at allonly plant-based (mostly corn-based) carbohydrates.A similar move away from organic lactose happened with Earths Best and Vermont Organics (again, both manufactured by PBM). In 2007, Earths Best infant formula contained only organic lactose as the added carbohydrate. When Vermont Organics entered the market in 2008, it mirrored Earths Best and also contained only organic lactose. By 2011, both Earths Best and Vermont Organics contained reduced amounts of organic lactose, which were replaced with organic glucose syrup solids.Organic glucose syrup solids is another name for organic corn syrup solids, which are partially hydrolyzed corn starch molecules that are dried to a low moisture powder (hence the name solids). Corn syrup solids are moderately sweet (sweeter than maltodextrin).BrandCompanyManufacturerCarbohydrate in 2013365 (Whole Foods) OrganicWhole Foods Markets, Inc.PBM NutritionalsOrganic Glucose Syrup Solids, Organic MaltodextrinBabys Only OrganicNatures OneNatures OneOrganic Brown Rice SyrupBright BeginningsPBM NutritionalsPBM NutritionalsOrganic Glucose Syrup Solids, Organic MaltodextrinEarths BestThe Hain Celestial GroupPBM NutritionalsOrganic Lactose, Organic Glucose Syrup SolidsParents Choice OrganicWal-MartPBM NutritionalsOrganic Glucose Syrup Solids, Organic MaltodextrinSimilac Organic Abbott LaboratoriesAbbott LaboratoriesOrganic Maltodextrin, Organic SugarVermont OrganicsPBM NutritionalsPBM NutritionalsOrganic Lactose, Organic Glucose Syrup SolidsSugarIn terms of the added sweetener, Abbott Laboratories took a different route for its Similac Organic product: sugar.Abbotts decision came under fire in 2008, when The New York Times reported on the various concerns regarding the use of sugar in infant formula. The Times even commissioned its own professional taste test. Similac Organic was the sweetest, with the sweetness of grape juice or Country Time lemonade, according to Gail Civille, the director of Sensory Spectrum, which performed the tests.The European Union banned sugar-sweetened infant formula in 2009, due to concerns with rising rates of childhood obesity and the possibility that overly sweet formula might lead to overfeeding. Sucrose (sugar) is allowed only in special formula for babies with allergies, and even then, it may not exceed 20% of the total carbohydrate content.The New York Times quoted Dr. Benjamin Caballero, director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and an expert in risk factors for childhood obesity: I would be very concerned about this as a pediatrician. The issue is that sweet tastes tend to encourage consumption of excessive amounts. Evidence shows that babies and children will always show a preference for the sweetest food available, he said, and they will eat more of it than they would of less-sweet food. This is how breakfast cereal manufacturers compete, he added.Despite the concerns raised in The New York Times, Abbott Laboratories continues to use sugar as the added carbohydrate.Brown Rice SyrupNatures One chose organic brown rice syrup as the added carbohydrate for its toddler formula. In 2012, researchers at Dartmouth University tested various foods for levels of arsenic, and found organic toddler formula made with organic brown rice syrup contained up to six times the U.S. EPA safe drinking water limit for inorganic arsenic (there are no established safety standards for arsenic in food, including infant formula).In response, Natures One developed an organic-compliant technology to filter and remove inorganic arsenic from its organic brown rice syrup to undetectable levels.Consumers Union tested Babys Only Organic products to determine if the company had indeed removed arsenic from its products, and confirmed Natures Ones claims that its formula now contains undetectable arsenic levels2. Palm Oil: Forms Soaps In The Babys GutNot all oil is created equalits a basic fact of nutrition science, and one that is especially important for infants. Human milk is naturally high in certain types of fatty acids, which formula manufacturers try to mimic by adding certain types of oil. And to mirror the levels of palmitic acid, a fatty acid found in human milk, some manufacturers add palm oil.However, palmitic acid from palm oil is structurally different from palmitic acid in human milk, and research has shown that human infants do not properly absorb it.The unabsorbed palmitic acid remaining in the infants gut reacts with calcium, and causes the formation of soaps in the babys intestines. This important finding has been reported on more than one occasion in the journal Pediatrics, of the American Academy of Pediatrics.Research suggests that the formation of soaps in the babys intestinal tract negatively affects a babys development and health. Since palmitic acid from palm oil is not absorbed properly, it means overall fat absorption is lower in babies given formula with palm oil. Bone mass is significantly lower in babies given formula containing palm oil, perhaps because the calcium in the babys intestines turns into soap rather than reaching the babys growing bones. And the soapiness in the intestines also leads to hard stools.According to researchers at Wayne State University, who performed a comprehensive review of published studies on the effects of palm oil in infant formula:The use of palm oil ininfantformulas to match the human milk content of palmitic acid has unintended physiological consequences. The avoidance of palm oil  ininfantformulas can prevent this detrimental effect.Despite these concerns, all organic formula products coming out of the PBM Nutritionals factory continue to contain palm oil. Earths Best did not contain palm oil when it first came on the market, but switched to palm oil in 2007.BrandCompanyManufacturerContains Palm Oil?365 (Whole Foods) OrganicWhole Foods Markets, Inc.PBM NutritionalsYesBabys Only OrganicNatures OneNatures OneNoBright BeginningsPBM NutritionalsPBM NutritionalsYesEarths BestThe Hain Celestial GroupPBM NutritionalsYesParents Choice OrganicWal-MartPBM NutritionalsYesSimilac Organic Abbott LaboratoriesAbbott LaboratoriesNoVermont OrganicsPBM NutritionalsPBM NutritionalsYes(As if parents needed another reason to avoid Enfamil, which offers no organic option, the first oil listed in Enfamil is palm oil). 3. Ingredients extracted with neurotoxic solvents from algae and soil fungusnot exactly the way mom makes it C. Cohnii oil (DHA) and M. Alpina oil (ARA):Six years ago, Cornucopias codirectors asked me to look into two ingredients, C. Cohnii oil and M. Alpina oil. They are marketed as DHA and ARA, and were starting to appear in organic infant formula without having gone through the proper approval process required by federal organic law.The oils were manufactured by a biotechnology corporation in Maryland (the company has since been bought by the Dutch multinational corporation Royal DSM), using processing aids and synthetic ingredients that are not approved for use in organics.Fresh out of a graduate program in nutrition, I could not help but dig deeper. I have to admit: I didnt want to be involved in filing a legal complaint against ingredients that might be beneficial to infant development. I was concerned we might be depriving infants if we actually succeeded in having the USDA pull these ingredients out of organic infant formula (I clearly underestimated the power of the infant formula lobby that wed be up against).I soon discovered from the scientific literature that we wouldnt be harming babies at all if they didnt have these additives in their formula. If fact, wed be protecting them from potential harm. Studies repeatedly failed to show benefits from adding these additives to formula, and the FDA had been receiving dozens of reports from parents and pediatricians who noticed some babies do not tolerate these ingredients. In 2008, we filed a legal complaint.DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid, and ARA is an omega-6 fatty acid. Both are naturally found in human milk, and DHA is a component of brain and eye tissue. But the DHA and ARA added to most brands of infant formula are extracted from factory-produced C. Cohnii and M. Alpinaspecific strains of algae and fungus that have never been part of the human diet, let alone the diet of infants.Since we released our report and filed the legal complaint, it has become even clearer that these additives are not necessary and are primarily added as marketing tools. Three of the most prominent and respected independent scientists in the field of infant formula science stated in 2010 that the scientific evidence base for DHA and ARAs addition to infant formula is recognized by most investigators and Key Opinion Leaders in the field to be weak, and that this field of research has been driven to an extent by enthusiasm and vested interest.Several comprehensive reviews of all published research have been conducted since we released our report, and all conclude that DHA and ARA had no proven benefit regarding vision, cognition, or physical growth. The World Health Organizations Director of Nutrition for Health and Development even wrote a letter in 2011 to members of the European parliament, letting them know that as to date no solid evidence exists to be able to say that adding DHA to infant formula will have important clinical benefits.When an Associated Press reporter asked the chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition, Dr. Frank Greer, to comment on DHA and ARA in infant formula, he said: The truth of the matter is, theyre not essential. Humans can synthesize these. Fatty acids are naturally present in the diet. And the whole issue becomes, do you make really make people smarter if you put DHA and ARA in everything? Or is this just all marketing hype? Personally, I lean toward the latter.When the C. Cohnii and M. Alpina oils first appeared in infant formula, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) received dozens of reports from physicians and parents who noticed diarrhea, vomiting, and other gastrointestinal distress in infants given formula with these oilssymptoms that disappeared when the infant was switched to the exact same formula without these novel additives.The FDA reports that no post-market surveillance has taken place to assure the safety and tolerance of these additivesdespite the FDAs clear request to the formula manufacturers to conduct rigorous post-market monitoring to ensure their safety.Another concern with these additives is how they are produced: the oil is extracted from the algae and fungus with the use of hexane, a neurotoxic petroleum-based solvent.When the USDA received legal complaints against the unapproved use of C. Cohnii and M. Alpina oils, a Washington lobbyist with the powerful law firm of Covington and Burling convinced USDA officials to open a loophole in the organic standards, which would allow the formula manufacturers to add the unapproved ingredients without facing enforcement action.While the USDA has since admitted that this was inappropriate, the agency has failed to take enforcement action and continues to bow to pressure from the infant formula industry. The National Organic Standards Board even explicitly stated that hexane-extracted algal oil and fungal oil should not be allowed in organic foods but the USDA has failed to act on this very clear and legally binding vote, and hexane-extracted DHA and ARA remains in organic infant formula.The only company that adheres to the legal requirement that DHA and ARA oil must not be extracted with the use of the neurotoxic solvent hexane is Natures One, which has chosen a water-extracted source of DHA and ARA (derived from egg yolks) for its Babys Only Organic formula.4. Carrageenan: Dangerous Inflammation In Your Babys GutIf you search for carrageenan in a medical database, thousands of search results will appear. Why so many? Because carrageenan is used in animal experiments to predictably cause inflammation, which allows pharmaceutical scientists to test the effectiveness of new anti-inflammatory drugs.In a report Cornucopia released earlier this year, we carefully analyzed the scientific literature on food-grade carrageenan, and found that scientists have raised concern about carrageenans safety for decades. These concerns are based on their research linking the common food additive to gastrointestinal disease in laboratory animals, including colon tumors.But the food industry, including the infant formula industry, has responded for decades by claiming that carrageenan is safebased largely on industry-funded studies, with flawed methodologies. When a Chicago Tribune reporter asked both the FDA and the carrageenan industry lobby group earlier this year to share studies that were not funded by the industry and that could indicate carrageenan is safe, they could not come up with a single one.Carrageenan appears in some organic infant formula, even though the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB) voted to prohibit it. The Secretary of Agricultures decision to disregard the NOSBs decision shows the lobbying power and influence of the infant formula industry.Carrageenan is prohibited in infant formulaconventional and organicin the European Union. The science linking carrageenan to intestinal inflammation is disturbing enough, but what adds insult to injury is that it is entirely unnecessary. Carrageenan contributes no nutritional value or flavor to formula, or other food, but is added to stabilize ready-to-feed formula. Adding carrageenan means parents or caregivers do not have to shake the product before feeding it to the baby. The alternative is to put a shake well label on the bottle.Earths Best and Similac Organic ready-to-feed formula, the only liquid organic formula on the market, both contain carrageenan.5. Synthetic Preservatives and Nutrients In Organics: A Mirror-Image Of The Synthetics In Conventional FormulaFederal law requires that a synthetic ingredient cannot be added to organic products unless it has been reviewed and approved by the National Organic Standards Board (NOSB). Two synthetic preservatives and numerous synthetic nutrients have recently been rejected by the NOSB. Final rulemaking is pending. For now, they remain in some organic infant formula products.Some brands contain more of these unapproved synthetics than others.Synthetic PreservativesThe NOSB rejected two synthetic preservatives: ascorbyl palmitate and beta-carotene.One of the primary reasons why formula manufacturers add these synthetic preservatives is to prevent the algal DHA and fungal ARA oils from going rancid.Since Babys Only Organic is the only formula that does not contain algal DHA oil and fungal ARA oil, it also is the only formula that does not contain these two synthetic preservatives.Synthetic NutrientsThe National Organic Standards Board rejected the use of the following synthetic nutrients in dairy-based formula: lutein, lycopene, nucleotides, taurine, l-carnitine and l-methionine.None of these nutrients are required in infant formula by the Food and Drug Administration, and all are prohibited in organic formula in the European Union. Some, like lutein and lycopene, are even prohibited in conventional infant formula in the European Union.Luteinis produced from conventionally grown marigoldslikely treated with insecticidesand processed with the neurotoxic solvent hexane.BrandCompanyManufacturerContains Lutein?365 (Whole Foods) OrganicWhole Foods MarketPBM NutritionalsNoBabys Only OrganicNatures OneNatures OneNoBright BeginningsPBM NutritionalsPBM NutritionalsNoEarths BestThe Hain Celestial GroupPBM NutritionalsNoParents Choice OrganicWal-MartPBM NutritionalsNoSimilac Organic Abbott LaboratoriesAbbott LaboratoriesYesVermont OrganicsPBM NutritionalsPBM NutritionalsNoLycopene is most commonly found in tomatoes, but the version in organic infant formula is produced synthetically by the chemical manufacturer BASF.

It is utterly disturbing that the infant formula and baby food aisle would contain some of the most egregious violations of the organic standards.Even after the National Organic Standards Board voted to prohibit hexane-extracted DHA and ARA, carrageenan, two synthetic preservatives and six synthetic nutrients in organic infant formula, these unapproved ingredients remain in organic products on store shelves (lobbying efforts by the formula industry are apparently paying off).Some parents make their own infant formula (Weston A. Price foundation has a recipe). Human milk sharing is becoming more popular as well, with social media making it increasingly easy to connect donors and recipients (check out Human Milk 4 Human Babies and Eats on Feets).Other parents import organic formula from Europe, such as the Holle brand from Germany, since it does not contain any of the unapproved synthetic preservatives and nutrients (Holle still does contain palm oil and maltodextrin). In Europe, as in the U.S., these ingredients are prohibited, and manufacturers there follow the law.Dont babies in the U.S. deserve the same? When will the USDAs officials in charge of overseeing the organic label stop bowing to the lobbying pressure of the infant formula lobbyists, and enforce the organic law?Please Take Action and Share This PostLet the USDA know how you feel about their decision to continue allowing carrageenan in organic infant formula. You have until June 3rd to submit a comment through the governments portal (for the required field organization, enter citizen). While youre sharing your thoughts on carrageenan, you can also urge the USDA to remove the other unapproved synthetic ingredients from organic infant formula.Writing this post was not easy. As a parent, I wish I could tell other parents who are in a bind and who need formula that the organic label signifies a safe option without any of the harmful ingredients found in conventional formula. As this post has shown, thats not always the case.That being said, let me stress again that organic infant formula remains a safer and a far superior alternative to conventional formula. Organic formulas milk does not come from cows that were fed GMO feed, given antibiotics or injected with synthetic growth hormones. Organic formulas sweeteners and oils cannot be GMO, treated with pesticides or extracted with neurotoxic solvents. So the choice between organic or conventional formula is a no-brainer.Until we get unapproved ingredients out of organic infant formula, I hope this information will help parents make informed decisions when purchasing formula for their babies.More about Charlotte Vallaeys:Former of Director of Farm and Food Policy at theCornucopia Institute(when this post was written)and now a Senior Analyst within theConsumer Safety and Sustainability Programat Consumers Union.With a Master of Theological Studies degree from Harvard University and a Master of Science degree from Tufts Universitys Friedman School of Nutrition Science and Policy, Charlottes research explores the ethics of our food system.

How To Eat Organic On A Budget (Over 75 Tips!),http://foodbabe.com/2013/05/20/how-to-eat-organic-on-a-budget/,"The one tried and true worry I get about living an organic lifestyle is the cost. Its likely the only immediate downside because everything else about living organically is pretty magical. Remember, non-organic food often containscancer-causing hormones, immunity destroying anti-bioticsand dangerous pesticides.Pesticides bynature are designed to kill, they are poison. So when given the choice, I dont know why anyone could logically buy food with poison sprayed on it? Pesticides can cause neurological problems, cancer, infertility, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea,allergies and asthma, wheezing, rashes and other skin problems,ADHD, birth defects and more. Thats why buying quality organic food and eating the most nutritious foods on the planet will save you BIG BUCKS down the road in medical costs, prescription drugs and doctor visitslike my friend Birke always says We can either pay the farmer or we can pay the hospital  Its totally up to us.Over 75 Tips On How to Eat Organic On A BudgetIn hopes to mitigate the initial money pains of buying organic, I want to share the top organic money saving ideas that Ive gathered from my friends and family members. And, let me tell you, I learned a lot myself while putting together this list and combining everyones tips into one cohesive guide. I cant wait to put some of these new ideas into practice.Let the savings begin!FIND AND USE ORGANIC COUPONSCheck the websites of your favorite companies for coupons and special promotions, almost all of them have some.Join your favorite companys social media pages for special coupons and deals.Checkout various organic coupon sites. Some of my favorite examples includeMambo Sprouts,All Natural SavingsandOrganic Dealsfor organic food/natural living coupons, and money savings ideas.Simply Organic who makes spices, seasoning mixes and baking mixes always have coupons on their websitehere sometimes more than a dollar off.Kroger has coupons orSimple Truth.Whole Foodshas couponshereevery week for various products throughout the store.Earth Fare has couponshereevery week for various products throughout the store.Most stores take each others coupons, so dont be afraid to use them all in one shopping trip at your most convenient or favorite store.AT HOME AND IN THE KITCHENStay organized. Plan out your meals for the week according to organic foods that are on sale and/or that you have coupons for.Budget. Write out a weekly and monthly budget to help you keep track of both erratic spending and responsible spending. This will allow you to see your spending habits and help you prioritize purchasing organic food within your budget.Do it yourself, rather than buy it. Make your own organic granola bars, kale chips, smoothies, juices to replaced store-bought with more overhead.Learn how to portion and prioritize  it is a necessity to always buy organic meats and dairy products, and, therefore, learn to portion your consumption of these products each week. For example, keep meat to 4 ounces or less per serving.Invest in a4 stage water filterinstalled directly under your sink to avoid having to buy bottled water. Also, check the Environmental Working Group guide on choosing the right water filter for you.Check out the book Wildly Affordable Organic for organic menu planning on $5 a day or less.USE YOUR FREEZER9 times out of 10 the organic frozen produce at the store is cheaper than fresh, especially if the fruit or vegetable is out of season.Freeze all left overs using inexpensive mason glass jars orsilicone ice moldsfor smaller portions.Freeze homemade cookie dough and other treats like almond freezer fudge, so you can have a treat ready to go in the appropriate portion size.Buy local produce when in season and freeze to save for out of season, for example in the spring and summer spread berries on a sheet pan and freeze overnight and then store in jars for the fall and winter.Double recipes and freeze leftovers, this works great with soups and stews.Freeze core kitchen staples like butter, cheese and bread scraps for bread crumbs or homemade croutons.MAKE CHOICESMeat & dairy (animals products like chicken, eggs, cheese, butter, yogurt, milk, etc.) are the most important to buy organic because of the combined risk of pesticide, anti-biotic and cancer causing growth hormone exposure. Whatever you do, do not skimp here.Reduce meat and dairy consumption if you cannot afford organic  One way to do this is tobe vegan before 6pm, as Mark Bittman explains in his latest book. For example, have a green smoothie for breakfast with ezekiel toast, and then a large salad with lentils at lunch or a wrap made with hummus and then at night choose high quality meat in small portions.Reduce amount of organic meat used by substituting half the portion with organic beans.Buy a whole organic chicken for less per pound, vs. just the breast, legs or wings which are more expensive per pound. You can use the carcass to make your own chicken broth.Use the Clean 15 and Dirty Dozen lists available on ewg.org to help you navigate which products to buy organic (or take with you when you travel).For example, if you have a choice between more expensive organic red peppers and less expensive conventional asparagus  choose the asparagus. Asparagus naturally repel pests allowing it to be grown with minimal pesticides. Include red pepper in your diet when it is in season or you can find it cheaper at another grocery store.Do not buy pre-washed and ready to eat fruits and veggies, as they can cost twice as much.Skip conventional Starbucks(and other coffee shops). Buy organic coffee and tea such as:Larrys Beans Organic CoffeeandNumiand make it yourself. This will actually save you time in the morning too.Eat out only twice a week  eating organic at home is significantly less expensive than eating at organic restaurants.BUY IN BULKTake advantage of the buy one get one free sales or buy one get the other for a discounted price. You never know when it will go on sale again, so make sure to take advantage of it and store for later use. (This trick only works if you really love the product and it is a staple at your home  otherwise this could lead to wasted food)Always buy packaged staples on saleBuy unpackaged foods from bulk dispensers  I personally save a ton of cash by doing this, I buy everything from oat groats, to nuts, to dried fruit and lentils.Bring measuring cups with you to the grocery store if you are buying from bulk containers. That way you can get exactly the amount you need for a specific recipe and you wont be paying for extra.Buy smaller organic spice packets or jars, old spices lose their medicinal qualities so it is smarter to buy in smaller quantities. For example, Earth Fare has little pre-portioned tiny ziplocs with herbs and spices available at the fraction of costs compared to a whole jar.Buy the whole animal and freeze the portions you dont use. I personally know someone who is on a budget and does this all the time. You can also do this by contacting your local farmer and then splitting the cost with a group.To satisfy a sweet tooth, skip the full size packages of candy and chocolate. Buy a few pieces in the bulk section, for example go for a few pieces of organic dried fruit or 10 chocolate covered almonds.Find out what foods are in season and buy those in bulk, as they are significantly cheaper.BUY ONLINEJoinThrive MarketThis website is like a health food store stocked up with non-GMO and organic groceries at drastically reduced prices (up to 25-50% off). Ive found that the quality of their products are always as good as what I can buy locally and they carry many of the brands I love and support.The way they work is similar to Costco because you need to join to shop, but their fee is really reasonable (works out to about $5 month). Ifyouve never shopped atThrive Market before, theyll give you your first month free so you can try it out and see if you love it as much as I do and theyll also give you25% off your first order.No code needed to get 25% off, justgo to this link.Amazon  One of my favorite shopping sites, because they basically have every brand available and ship free over $25.00.VitaCost  Another low cost website that has a wide variety of organic and healthy foods, vitamins, etc.Herbs Pro  Another low cost website that has a wide variety of organic and healthy foods, vitamins, etc.Before you check out online, visitRetail Me Not for online promotional codes and discounts for all your favorite online stores and sources.CHOOSE ORGANIC BRANDS THAT SAVE YOU MONEYChoose more inexpensive grocery store brand products like Trader Joes, Earth Fare, 365 brand, ShopRite, Wegmans, Kroger, Publix, Harris Teeter. Regardless of the brand, they are all required to follow the same guidelines set forth by the USDA organic certification program if they contain the USDA organic seal and chances are that you wont be able to tell the difference between a brand name and store brand.Join grocery store loyalty programs for discounts. For example, if you join Earth Fares tomato bank program, you get a dollar back for every 100 points you earn.Use your rewards cards always. Most convenient stores, grocery stores, and drug stores allow you to sign-up for a rewards or savings card that will help you save money on a few of your items at the checkout counter. Even if this time of purchase does not contain organic food, the extra money that you are saving on your items can be put towards buying it when need be.Always remember that if you are not satisfied with your organic product, most grocery stores and organic food companies offer you money back guarantee. This also works for companies you bought in the past that you are now boycotting like KraftCheckEbayssection for food and beverages, prices are really cheap!BUY LOCALLocal food can be significantly cheaper than food shipped from miles away.Find a farmers market near you throughLocalHarvest.orgorthe USDA get to know your local farmers, create a personal relationship and negotiate prices.Ask your farmer about his farming practices.Some farmers do not spray pesticides on their crops but do not seek USDA certification to keep prices lower.Be the last person to leave the farmers market. Farmers will likely cut their prices at the end of the day, so they do not have to take their produce back to the farm.Buy a share in a community-supported agriculture CSA program. Its nice to contribute toa local farms operating expenses while getting a weekly box of fresh fruits and vegetables.GROW YOUR OWN FOODPlant an herb pot in your kitchen or somewhere convenient so you can always have fresh herbs on hand. Organic herbs are one of the most overpriced items at the grocery store.Follow these tipsfrom The Organic Consumers Association to grow organic food inside your home year round.Check this amazing guidethat details out all the options and information you need to start urban farming at your home regardless of how much space you have.Once you start growing produce, give herbs, fruits and vegetables as gifts to family and friends (saving money on other material objects they might otherwise not use or collect).Remember to buy non-GMO seeds, check outSow True Seedfor lots of options.Check out growinglessons learnedfrom 100 Days of Real Food.Learn how to can the produce you grow,heres a how-to-guidefor strawberry jam.Get a couple of chickens and hatch your own eggs. One friend of mine has so many eggs she doesnt know what to do with them. You could also sell them to your neighbors or give them as hostess gifts.TRAVEL WITH ORGANIC FOODOn a road trip useEatWellGuide.orgto find out where to buy local, organic and sustainable foods from point to the other.Remember, a pricey restaurant doesnt equal organic or quality food  going to a grocery store and picking up some organic food will save you money and your health.Bring your food with you in a cooler  even if you are flying. Did you know you cancheck a cooler?Bring organic tea with you and ask for hot water. A cup of tea can cost up to $5 dollars, vs. $1 dollar you would tip the barista or server.Bring filtered water with you wherever you go in areusable safe water bottleso you never have to buy expensive bottled water.Always carry snacks like homemade trail mix in your purse or bag for emergencies.At the movies, bring your own organic popcorn and snacks if they do not offer them. There is no reason to pay a premium for conventional food.STOP WASTING FOODQuick fact: Americans waste an estimated 1,400 calories of food per person EVERY SINGLE DAY.Raw nuts and flours should be kept in the refrigerator to last longer without going rancid.Line your refrigerators crisper drawer with paper towels to absorb excess moisture. Theyll absorb excess moisture which will help keep produce longer.To repel bugs, place a bay leaf in containers of rice, flour and pastas.Buy and keep bananas separated from one another, they spoil slower.Turn almond butter, yogurt, sour cream, tahini and cottage cheese containers upside down when stored in the fridge  this creates a vacuum seal, keeping them fresh longerDo not throw away nut meal from homemade nut milk  use it for smoothies, baked goods likebiscottior to make nut flours by placing the pulp on a baking sheet and drying it out in a 250 degree oven or dehydrator.Repurpose vegetable pulp from juicing to add fiber to soups, smoothies or make crackers or bread.Placed limp celery, baby carrots and radishes in water with a slice of potato to make them crunchy again.Keep all organic citrus fruits in the fridge  they will last up to 1-2 weeks longer.Do not wash organic dark leafy greens or berries until they are ready to consume.Store herbs, spring onions, asparagus upright in a large glass filled with an inch of waterLearn tips and recipes on how to use over the edge food. For examples,panzanella with stale bread, and banana bread with overripe bananas.If you know you will not have a chance to eat it, freeze food before it goes bad.Choose to eat less, use a smaller plate to help you control the amount of food you might eat or end up wasting.Compost all food waste to put nutrients back in your garden (you will spend less on fertilizer).If you know someone whos struggling to buy organic because of cost, or that needs a little extra cash (like most of us!), please share this post with them.Thanks for spreading the word  lets make buying organic easier for everyone!Food BabeP.S.Got any more organic food budget tips?

The Ingredients in Sunscreen Destroying Your Health,http://foodbabe.com/2013/05/05/what-you-need-to-know-before-you-ever-buy-sunscreen-again/,"Your skin is your largest organ.It covers and protects everything on your body. How you treat it is incredibly important to your health. However, the skin is one of the most unappreciated organs, and one that I used to totally take for granted, slathering products full of toxic chemicals on it day after day. When I look back at all the different potions Ive tried, I shake my head in disbelief and wish I would have known better. Not only would I not have developed eczema all over my body and face, but I would have looked a million times better growing up.One of those products that has always caused me issues  is sunscreen. Every time after a beach vacation or going to the pool, Id end up with a rash on my face or body. I wondered if Id eaten something that I was allergic to. Little did I know at the time  the culprit was sunscreen.The unknown long-term consequences of the chemicals in sunscreen are just starting to be revealed and the results are shockingly horrific, going beyond the common skin rash. Here in the United States, the FDA does not regulate cosmetics as rigorously as pharmaceuticals or food  allowing cosmetic companies to get away with using all types of chemical ingredients that are not used and in some cases banned in other countries. Sounds familiar  eh? Sunscreen is supposed to protect us from harmful UV radiation from the sun, but as more people use sunscreen, the incidence of skin cancer continues to rise. This fact alone has to make you think  do sunscreens really provide skin cancer protection? Or could the chemicals in them actually be contributing to causing skin cancer?It gets complicated trying to answer those questions. Some studies have shown that sunscreens do in fact protect us from some types of less threatening forms of skin cancers, but others have found that sunscreens have actually contributed to the risk of some of the worst forms of skin cancers.So what do you do?I certainly dont want to look like a wrinkly old hag when Im older from laying out in the sun too long without protection  but I also dont want to increase my cancer risk by using products that could be harmful. Anti-aging is important to me and thats why I live the way I do  not only do I want to look my best when Im older, I want to feel my best too.Below are my favorite sunscreen brands that are rated between 0-2 for their entire line of sun care products and are the safest available. Ive included the links on where to find these brands online if you cant find them in stores near you  but most natural food stores and vitamin shops will have one of these options available.Badger Certified organic, several different SPFs and option for kids, babies and active people, unscented availableThinkbaby/Thinksport Great for athletes, kids and adults for prolonged exposure in sun.John Masters Organics SPF 30, only one option availableSeventh Generation SPF 30, only one option availableAubrey Organics SPF 26-45 available, unscented availableRaw Elements The first organic, non-GMO certified sunscreen. (Try the tinted stick for your face  its awesome!) Ive partnered with them to give you discount Get 10% with code:foodbabeSunology  Kids, Face and Body Protection  one of my favorites, because it glides in easilyCalifornia Baby(Target carries this brand)  Formulated for sensitive skin, SPF18-30*Note  Alba and Kiss My Face are two other brands that are safer than most conventional brands. However, you must only choose their mineral based products  for exampleAlbas Mineral SPF 30 UnscentedandKiss My Faces Mineral Lotion SPF 40are great choices  but other versions in the same brand category may not be as safe.There are over 1800 products on the market to choose from, making it incredibly confusing and difficult to pick the best and safest brand. Heres what you need to watch out for:Oxybenzone this is a hormone disrupting chemicalwhich penetrates the skin and enters the bloodstream. It is the most popular ingredient in chemical based sunscreens and only blocks UVB ray (suns good rays that provide vitamin D production), not UVA which are the most free radical damaging rays. Avoid any sunscreen that has this chemical at all costs, especially for children.Vitamin A (Retinyl Palmitate)  A 2009 study by U.S. government scientists released by the National Toxicology Program found when this is applied to the skin in the presence of sunlight, it may speed the development of skin tumors and lesions.Fragrance  Sure it may make the product smell nice, but this is a petroleum based product that is linked to organ toxicity and allergies.High SPF  The FDA does not regulate SPF higher than 50 and theres no scientific proof they work better than lower SPF. Many of the higher SPFs do not provide any additional protection and studies have suggested that users are exposed to as many or more ultraviolet rays as those who use lower-SPF products.Sprays or Powders  Generally speaking, sprays and powders have additional chemicals added to them for performance purposes. These additional chemicals are usually not something you want to be spraying on your body and can be toxic to the lungs. Besides, remember sunscreen is formulated for your skin, not your lungs. Many of the side effects of sprays and powders on the lungs are not tested before being approved.Popular Conventional Brands Aveeno, Banana Boat, Coppertone Sport, Coppertone Water Babies, Bull Frog, Neutragena, Storebrands (CVS, Rite Aid, Walgreens), Hawaiian Tropic and many other popular brands are rated the worst in terms of safety in theEnvironmental Working Groups Sunscreen Guide. You can use this guide to find out how good or bad the brand you have or want to buy is rated.How To Choose A Safe Sunscreen:Look fortitanium dioxide and zinc oxidebased mineral sunscreens, which do not penetrate the skin and provide UVA protection against the suns most damaging rays.Choose non-nano products that do not have small particles that can absorb into skinChoose sunscreens that are unscented or use essential oils as fragrancePick lotion based sunscreens with water resistancePick broad spectrum sunscreens that protect against UVA and UVB raysChoose sunscreen products that are rated 0-2in the Environmental Working Groups Sunscreen Guide.When it comes to being in the sun, Im lucky. I tan, dont burn and dont completely freak out if I forgot my sunblock  however, because of my olive complexion I have to stay in the sun longer in order to get sufficient Vitamin D. (The lighter your skin color, the faster your absorption of Vitamin D). I wear sunblock at the pool, at the beach and when Im outdoors for extended periods, but Ive decided not to wear it everyday.Using as little as 15 SPF blocks your bodys ability to convert the suns rays to Vitamin D by 99%. If you want to increase your chances of avoiding diseases linked to deficiencies in Vitamin D (cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and depression)  you must get sunshine! The suns rays are pure wonderful energy your body needs.Before I go  I want to mention this important fact. The biggest immediate benefit of getting sun a few times a week is the reduction of cravings. When Vitamin D levels are low, the hormone that controls appetite stops working. You eat and eat and eat, and never feel full when this happens. The sun contributes significantly to the daily production of Vitamin D, and as little as 10 minutes of exposure a few times a week is enough to help prevent deficiencies. Vitamin D also helps boost serotonin levels, your happy hormone, warding off depression which naturally reduces cravings. For me, this is reason enough to let the sun shine in!If you know someone that might still be buying sunscreen with shady ingredients, please share this post with them, you could have a serious impact on their livelihood!Thank you for spreading the word to the ones you love.Food BabeP.S.

Our Response to Kraft’s Letter: It’s Time To Surrender Your Artificial Dyes,http://foodbabe.com/2013/03/14/our-response-to-krafts-letter-its-time-to-surrender-your-artificial-dyes/,"Its been a little over one week since we started apetition to remove artificial food dyesfrom Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. We have over228,000 signaturesand, while we heard from Kraft right after the petition launched, it was not the response we were hoping for.We thought it would be important to share their response and exact letter with you, so you can understand exactly what we are up against.Below youll see Krafts letter to us along with our specific response and reaction inbold.From Kraft:Thanks for contacting us. The safety and quality of our products is our highest priority and we take consumer concerns very seriously. We carefully follow the laws and regulations in the countries where our products are sold. So in the U.S., we only use colors that are approved and deemed safe for food use by the Food and Drug Administration.Our Response: When Kraft found out the safety of artificial food dyes was in question in Europe  why didnt they make the safety of U.S. citizens their highest priority, too? Food is food  whether in our country or someone elses  why not make all Kraft products standardized to the highest safety regulation across the board? Kraft was able to reformulate their products without artificial dyes in the U.K. without noticeably changing the color or taste  we even taste tested it ourselves just to prove this point. We know it can be done; Kraft doesnt have to reinvent the wheel.To further prove this point  Kraft stated this fact themselves by reformulating Lunchables in the UK without compromising quality, taste and food safety.Kraft Foods UK has no products aimed at children that contain the ingredients highlighted in the FSA [Southampton] study. . . . [W]ith our recent Lunchables reformulation in the UK, we reduced fat and salt, as well as removed artificial colours and flavours. Without compromising quality, taste and food safety, we will continue to see where we can make changes and still meet consumer expectations.Kraft Foods UK (Quote Taken fromAllergyKidsFoundation)Because Kraft has not willingly and proactively reformulated their products in the US, its obvious to us that Krafts highest priority is their bottom line. We are asking Kraft, a multi-billion dollar company, to be the leader in the US Food Industry by voluntarily removing artificial dyes and owning up to the statements they make about safety and quality of their products.From Kraft:We expanded our line of KRAFT Mac & Cheese (KMC) offerings. We know some people prefer foods without certain ingredients  we now offer a multitude of products without added colors, as well as products with natural food colors including:KMC Organic White CheddarKMC Organic CheddarKMC White CheddarKMC AlfredoKMC Deluxe Original CheddarKMC Deluxe Four CheeseKMC Deluxe Sharp CheddarKMC Homestyle Creamy Parmesan AlfredoKMC Homestyle Sharp Cheddar and BaconKMC Homestyle Classic CheddarKMC Homestyle Hearty Four CheeseKMC Homestyle Bowl Southwest TortillaKMC Homestyle Bowl Creamy Broccoli with White CheddarKMC Cup AlfredoOur Response: Who prefers food with artificial color? We are not sure many consumers do since it adds no benefit or nutritional value to the foods its in and is simply a cheap, cosmetic additive. And what about all the kids that reach for the boxes with cartoon characters? Do you really think they are going to pick out the Organic/Homestyle version over Spongebob? The above options of Macaroni and Cheese without artificial dyes are not targeted towardschildren, and the versions that are specifically designed for children do contain Yellow #5 and Yellow #6. Children are the ones that are most at risk for complications when consuming artificial dyes. In Europe, a food company is required to use a warning label when using artificial food dyes stating, May cause adverse effects in activity and attention in children on the package.But meanwhile back in the US, Kraft features children regularly in commercials and goes as far as holding essay contests specifically for children to promote the introduction and creation of new product lines containing artificial food dyes  products like Cheddar Explosion, Extreme Cheese Explosion, and Grilled Cheese Explosion.Since artificial dyes provide no value but do pose risks, we believe it is up to Kraft to voluntarily change their product and stop exploiting the FDA laws to their financial advantage. The 30 or so Kraft varieties that do still contain artificial dyes in the US are unfair to the children lured by these products, unfair to the less fortunate who buy these products because they are cheaper, and unfair to the uneducated consumer that is unaware of these potentially harmful ingredients.Even the FDA admits we should be concerned, stating the following on theirwebsite:Exposure to food and food components, including AFC [Artificial Food Colors] and preservatives, may be associated with behavioral changes, not necessarily related to hyperactivity, in certain susceptible children with ADHD and other problem behaviors, and possibly in susceptible children from the general population.Yellow #5 and #6 both have not been retested since their approval  do we have confidence in the FDA to keep up to date on health risks considering there were91 artificial dyes(allowed in food, drugs, cosmetics, or medical devices) that were at one point approved by the FDA that are now no longer authorized or have been restricted?Also what about all the big restaurant chains like Applebees, IHOP, Perkins, Dennys, Longhorn Steakhouse, Bob Evans and Steak n Shake offering Kraft Macaroni & Cheese in kids meals and on menus across the country? These children do not get a choice between mac & cheese with or without dyes  instead they are solely offered the riskier option.From Kraft:We appreciate the opportunity to share this information with you.Our Response: Sharing this information with us does not address our petition nor does it address our concerns for the health of Americans. We request that Kraft listen to the (228,000+) people signing our petition and the families who have reached out to us directly in concern.Weve received numerous letters from parents and people who have had dramatic improvements in the health of their families after removing artificial dyes. Here are just a few excerpts from these hundreds of letters  we hope this finally convinces Kraft to act and remove artificial dyes:Artificial dyes caused him to have tantrums that nobody could believe  after eating anything containing dye  absolutely any and everything could set him off into a tantrum and he would scream in such a state of rage that he was unreachable for approx. 50-60 minutes at a time. TracyMy son had very bad eczema along with hyper activity when he was younger. After years of expensive medicine and creams for his skin we decided to stop eating foods with dyes in them.The results were astounding. I had a much more manageable child with beautiful skin.  ReneeMy 5 year old son, has horrible reactions to artificial dyes. Weve always been very cautious about what we eat, we dont buy products that contain artificial ANYTHING, but we used to let him partake in treats at parties that contain artificial colorings, until we realized the random violent outbursts he was having came only after consuming artificial dyes. Normally, he is a very sweet soul, but the day after Halloween, when we had allowed him to eat skittles, he had a violent outburst in class where he threw a chair. A CHAIR. His teachers were shocked, so were we.  EmilyWe struggled for over 2 years, trying various strategies to stop the tantrums, teach him to self-soothe and calm himself when overstimulated, and help him sleep through the night again. Nothing worked until we eliminated artificial food dyes from his diet when he was 4 1/2 years old. We saw dramatic results just 5 days after eliminating them. He started sleeping through the night consistently for the first time since he was a baby, and his intense and long-lasting tantrums also disappeared.  JenniferMy 5 old daughter is hypersensitive to food dyes which we didnt discover until we took them away. Her behavior was off the charts fighting, screaming, and just plain unhappy. We removed artificial food from her diet, she became a different child. She is happy and compliant. But if she has any thing containing food dye, she losses her mind and will begin to scream, fight, hit the halls. Finally at the age of 5 she is able to tell me when she has a headache and its alway after having something containing artificial food dye at school. This cant be just a coincidence!! I mean every time my daughter has artificial food dye she is in pain!  KelliMy 14 year old daughter was diagnosed with eczema when she was 3 months old. We have been to many Doctors and have had way to many prescriptions. The triggers for this condition are many. The major ones that we have found that bother her are artificial dyes.As you can imagine, it is very difficult to keep all of them out of our homes. It is something that we need to be mindful of everyday if she wants to stay healthy.I truly believe that all dyes should be banned for our food supply today. Not only our food supply but also from medications, whether over-the-counter or prescription.  KerryOne of my sons is allergic to artificial food dyeto the point of it being life-threatening. His breathing becomes labored, he becomes lethargic and we must have (dye-free) Benadryl and an EPI Pen Jr. on hand at all times. Fortunately, we try to eat very naturally so we were able to identify the issue fairly quickly. However, its very difficult to protect him from artificial food dye in public, i.e. visiting friends/family, church, schools, etc. It would be a relief to this momma if artificial food dye were out of U.S. food products.   JenMy son has Aspergers, a form of autism. Food dyes significantly affect his behavior sometimes leading to explosive tantrums. Red dye #40 causes aggression and self injury. Blue #2 and yellow #5 affect his communication and emotional state. Basically, he becomes nasty and grumpy. Unable to tell us how he is really feeling, this behavior leads to tantrums. Food dye is not allowed in my house. Why do I care if other children eat it? Because until people are fully educated on the side effects of the poison they feed their children they are not able to make rational choices.  MicheleMy son is adversely affected by artificial colors. Several months ago we removed all foods with artificial colors and flavorings from his diet to see if his behavior would improve. We were amazed to find that by removing these from his diet he has a better attention span and is less fidgety. If there is ever a time when he does eat something with these dyes in it, after about 20 minutes I can tell.  ChristieMy 2 year old daughter breaks out in hives from artificial food dyes.  KatieWe were having a hard time with his behavioral outbursts when I read an article on how food dyes can often effect kids with ADHD. I decided for the heck of it to remove them from our home. We already eat pretty healthy, but Mac and Cheese was one thing that my son loved and was willing to eat. I switched to the organic brand Annies and also now read every thing I buy. If it contains and food coloring at all, we dont buy it. Within a month my son completely changed. His erratic behavior was gone and he was able to focus a lot more on tasks. His stimming (self stimulating behaviors that you see with Autism) also decreased significantly.   LoriWe hope you join us and demand this change by signing this petition nowand sharing it with as many people as you know. Together we can make our voices heard!With Much Love,Vani1657@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

Coca Cola’s Low Calorie Beverages Will Kill You Before They Solve Obesity,http://foodbabe.com/2013/01/25/coca-colas-low-calorie-beverages-will-kill-you-before-they-solve-obesity/,"When I saw Coca-Colas new anti-obesity ad, my jaw dropped wide open. Yes, you read that right Coca-Cola is on a new mission to fight the obesity epidemic now, in what I call a desperate attempt to prevent declining sales. The sad part is that some people will actually believe their nonsense. In the advertisement they try to make a case that there is room for Coca-Cola products in peoples healthy diets.Coca-Cola is promoting the introduction of new low calorie beverages and using the failed logic of a calorie is a calorie to convince people who need to lose weight to keep Coca-Cola products around in their diet.But you know what? A calorie isnt a calorie  when its made up of chemicals that affect how much you eat and the way your body metabolizes those chemicals.So Im here to break that down for you and detail out why Coca-Colas low calorie beverages will not fight obesity  and if anything  the reliance on low calorie chemical-filled drinks just perpetuates the problem even more. Proving in fact, that these drinks will continue to be linked to the increase in obesity.If you want to see the full advertisement videoit is at the bottom of this postbut I dont recommend watching it (unless you want to get a good laugh) because it deserves no more attention and I want you to focus on the truth that I am about to share with you now.(And when you see this advertisement being played during the Super Bowl coming up  I suggest you yell loudly at the TV, like I plan on doing.)Quotes from Coca-Colas Anti Obesity Advertisement:For over 125 years, we have been bringing people togetherReally?? How? By selling a products to adults and children that are linked to diabetes, heart disease and obesity? Hmmm. What do you call spending millions of dollars against the consumers right to know  i.e. GMO labeling  Is this bringing people together? If anything  it makes you an enemy company people should boycott.Weve created smaller portion control sizes for our most popular drinks and well have then in about 90% of the country by the end of this yearA smaller can of poison will not solve obesity. Thank you.No matter where they come from, including Coca-Cola and everything else with calories.And if you eat and drink more calories than you burn off, youll gain weight This is faulty logic and Ill show you why in just a minuteAcross our portfolio of more than 650 beverages we now offer over 180 low and no calorie choices and most of our full calorie beverages now have low or no calorie versions.Over the last 15 years, this has helped reduce the average calories per serving across our industries products in the US by about 22% This is where I want to take a closer look at exactly which low calorie beverages Coca-Cola is referring to here are some examples and the ingredients these low calorie beverages include:Artificial Sugars  Linked to Obesity and aMyriadof DiseasesSure you can save some calories drinking beverages with artificial sugars, but you wont reduce your risk of obesity or getting a tumor.If someone is trying to lose weight, the consumption of artificial sweeteners is not the solution and will not work as long term strategy. Artificial Sweeteners are proven to stimulate your appetite, increase carbohydrate cravings, and promote fat storage and weight gain.Thats right  consuming artificial sweeteners actually increases your appetite. Think about it  when someone consumes something that is sweet, but it has little to no calories  their brain receives a signal to want more calories because their body is not actually getting any energy (i.e. enough calories) to get satisfied. So that person keeps looking for gratification elsewhere and ends up craving more.The fact that Coca-Cola and other food industry giants are getting away with this orchestrated deception is unbelievable and then to say developing low calorie beverages using these artificial sweeteners is actually going to help the obesity epidemic? Seriously? Who are they kidding?Furthermore, there are more dangerous side effects from artificial sweeteners, especially aspartame, which is considered one the most dangerous substances allowed in our food supply. Aspartame is found in Powerade, Diet Coke, Coke Zero, Diet Dr. Pepper, Fanta Light, Fuze, Minute Maid Light, etc.Over 10,000 complaints have been filed with the FDA on this substance since 1980 and has actually never been proven to be safe before it was approved for use in our food supply. Aspartame is linked to diabetes, auto-immune disorders, depression (which can cause you to eat more  once again), birth defects, and several forms of cancer.Erythritol found in Vitamin Water Zero is a sugar alcohol the body does not easily digest and is linked to diarrhea, headache and other intestinal disorders.Acesulfame Potassium or acesulfame K is the one of main sweeteners in Minute Maid Fruit Falls  which is a low calorie beverage aimed at kids  and Monster Zero for example. According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) it is anything but safe.CSPI reportedthesafety tests of acesulfame-K that were conducted in the 1970s were inadequate. Specifically, two rat studies suggest that the additivemight cause cancer,but these studies were never addressed by the FDA before they approved the substance to also be used unregulated in soft drinks. In addition it is mentioned that large doses of acetoacetamide (a breakdown product of this sugar) have been shown to affect the thyroid in rats, rabbits, and dogs. As you might know  the thyroid gland  regulates the endocrine system, which is responsible the metabolism.If Coca-Cola wanted to really improve their offerings  they would immediately eliminate artificial sugars from their products.Natural Flavors  Trick Consumers To Drink MoreBy producing zero or low calorie drinks that taste like the real thing, Coca-Cola is hijacking your taste buds one by one. Food scientists can engineer natural flavors to cause the inability to stop eating or drinking. All of the Coca-Cola products listed above have added natural flavors.These flavors scientists synthesize trick your mind into wanting more and more. They dont want you to have the full essence of the strawberry or real coconut  they want you to only experience the best 1 millionth part of the taste  so you get addicted and keep having to go back for more and more, searching continuously for gratification  eating more of that product which in turns fills Coca-Colas pocket, as well as other big food companies.This is an industry trick that is used in so many products  beyond drinks  but is the most prevalent in low calorie beverages. In a few versions of Coca-Colas product Zico  a coconut water  they have to use natural flavors to cover up the fact that they are getting coconuts from all over the world, that taste different, which they then process into concentrate. Thecoconut water is heated down to syrup and then reconstituted with water.To keep the flavor consistent  they have to add back in natural flavors and what you end up with is an inferior product that is a mix of several different species of coconuts that have lost their original integrity, taste and nutrition.Artificial Colors  Attract Adults and Children to Unhealthy DrinksAdding artificial colors into food, actually contributes to the obesity epidemic by attracting children (and adults) to fake sweetened drinks that provide almost zero nutrition. This is another marketing ploy by Coca-Cola to target more people to get addicted to their products.Additionally  its important to note  the caramel coloring that Coca-Cola and other soda giants like Pepsi use  is completely artificial  not the stuff you make at home by cooking sugar.This caramel color is manufactured by heating ammonia and sulfites under high pressure, which creates carcinogenic compounds. A highdose of this known carcinogen is proven to causeliver tumors, lung tumors, and thyroid tumorsin rats and mice.WhenThe Center for Science in the Public Interestreleased a study last year found dangerous levels of caramel coloring could be contributing tothousands of cancersin the US, it prompted Coca-Cola and Pepsi to quickly change their formulas so they didnt have to include the cancer warning label on their products in California.Regardless of the reformulation  many of Coca-Colas products still contain this caramel coloring  even if its in a lesser amount. How small of a dose of poison are you willing to take on a regular basis?Overconsumption of Caffeine  Causes Addiction and Adrenal FatiqueThe reason why so many of Coca-Colas low calorie drinks contain caffeine  is because they want you to become addicted. The stimulation you get from the caffeine, along with the taste of something sweet  keeps you coming back for more and more. One of the most alarming drinks on the market is Monster Zero which can directly affect how your adrenal glands function and lead to persistent exhaustion. What happens when people are exhausted all the time? They stop moving and likely gain weight.Right now, Monster energy drinks is being sued by multiple families because it is suspected to have caused death of their loved ones. Despite these lawsuits and the recent FDA report about the dangers of energy drinks, Monster continues to be on the market.Genetically Modified Organisms or GMOs  Linked to ObesityEvery single one of Coca-Colas products here are likely to have GMOs. Thats because they have a hidden corn based product  like sorbitol, fructose, aspartame, maltodextrin, or citric acid. And why in the world would they have spent millions fighting GMO-labeling in California, if their products werent full of them!A study published in the International Journal of Biological Sciences shows that GM food is indeed contributing to the obesity epidemic. The study found that GM corn fed to mice led to an increase in overall body weight of about 3.7 percent, while also increasing the weight of the liver by up to 11 percent.The American Academy of Environmental Medicine (AAEM), reported studies that show GMOs responsible for faulty insulin regulation and therefore advise their patients to have GMO-free diets.Preservatives  Accelerate Aging and Acidify The BodyPreservatives like sodium benzoate are in almost all of Coca-Colas products. The Mayo Clinic reported that this preservative mayincrease hyperactivityin children. Also, when sodium benzoate combines with ascorbic acid (vitamin C) benzene can form acarcinogen and kill DNA cells, and accelerate aging.Preservatives cause accelerated aging because they acidify the body. Dr. Jameth Sheridan (D.H.M.) Doctor of Holistic Medicine,states that it takes 36 glasses of water to re-alkaline your body after drinking just one diet soda. 36 glasses! Wow.When your body is in an alkaline state your chances of developing disease is significantly lower than a body in an acidic state. This is because our bodies are made of up of billions of cells that are naturally alkaline according to its ph balance. When we consume more acidic foods (i.e. many of Coca-Colas low calorie drinks) vs. alkaline foods this upsets the balance and leads to all sorts of trouble for our bodies and the organs that regulate our metabolism and weight.Bisphenol A (aka BPA)in Cans  Linked to ObesityAfter reviewing the results of over 3,000 children and teens who had high urine BPA levels and high body mass index, a very recent studydetermined that BPA is linked to childhood obesity.BPA has already been banned in baby bottles  however, kids across the country are still drinking Coca-Cola products tainted with this environmental toxin.Coca-Cola has downright refused to eliminate BPAfrom its products and even defends the use of this metabolism destroying compound on their website.Fructose & Fruit Juice From Concentrate  Too Much Sugar For the Body To ProcessYoull find crystalline fructose in Vitamin Water Zero, which ismade from (genetically modified) corn starch which is 20% sweeter than sugar.Fructose is processed by the body differently than other sugars  and is linked to fatty liver disease, cirrhosis, coronary arterial disease and obesity.Coca-Cola claims that they have helped remove soda from schools by replacing them with juices. (This not entirely true  they actually fought the removal of vending machinesin schools).Nonetheless, these juices are mainly comprised of fruit juice concentrates and do little if anything to solve the problem of obesity.Consuming fruit juice concentrate on a regular basis actually overloads sugar in the liver, which increases the risk of diabetes, heart disease and obesity.For instance, Minute Maid fruit juice might contain several ounces of straight fructose, with none of the fiber, pulp, or living enzymes that help the body properly digest the sugar.A Cola Cola sponsored smoothie bar using real whole fruit in schools would be a MUCH better solution  just a thought.____________________________________________________In summary, at the end of Coca Cocas advertisement they invite you to.To learn more, and visit coke.com/comingtogether Ha! Thats funny. When pigs fly!Thats the last place anyone should go to learn about solving obesity.If you know a friend or family member who still consumes Coca-Cola products  especially these low or zero calorie beverages  please share this article with them.You could be their hero!Wishing you lots love, health and a longer life than this tortoise.Food Babe140K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

Why You Shouldn’t Buy Supermarket Birthday Cakes,http://foodbabe.com/2012/04/06/why-you-shouldnt-buy-supermarket-birthday-cakes/,"My birthday was last week and I had only one thing on my mind. Can you guess what it was?  Nope, it wasnt thoughts about getting older, or what presents I wanted this year or where I wanted to go on my next vacation. All I could think about was Where am I going to get my birthday cake from!?!This is a dilemma for my family and me every single time there is a birthday on the horizon. We sometimes have knock down, drag out fights about where we buy our cakesand thats because not everyone in my family follows the same real food principles as I do. (Im secretly hoping they will read this post so theyll think twice about fighting me next time around!)Growing up we would always get our cake from the local grocery store chain Harris Teeter. This was our go-to cake for as long as I can remember. Then in college and in my early twenties I became a Costco member and was thrilled to be able to get such a huge decadent cake for only $14.99 on my college budget.  As I became more refined in my taste for cake, I thought it would be a good idea to upgrade and shop at the Fresh Market because well it had to be fresher than Harris Teeter or Costco, right? Unfortunately, as youll find out this couldnt be further from the truth.When you look into these three different cakes from three very different places  a regular grocery store vs. a huge wholesaler warehouse store vs. a specialty market  you dont see much difference in the ingredients. They all resemble one big science experimentLets take a look at some of the cakes at Harris Teeter. This cake says Home-style carrot cake but when you you look closely at the ingredients it reveals something much differentWe know why Lisa dislikes artificial colors (that are unfortunately in all the cakes I am sharing with you here today.) But lets talk about a new and scary ingredient you may not have heard of  propylene glycol. This petroleum based chemical food additive  thats been approved by the FDA  is also found in products like brake fluid, acrylic paints, tile grout, primer, shoe polish, antifreeze, floor polish, tire sealant and sealant paste, according to Food Facts.org. It has been reported on Dr. Mercola.com that the following symptoms can arise after repeated small doses  throat irritation, headache, backache, and kidney problems. Furthermore, ingesting very large doses of this chemical can cause drowsiness, vomiting, respiratory failure, coma, convulsions, or can be fatal.Yes  you have to ingest a lot of this stuff to see some of these reactions  but is saying death by a thousand cuts? taking it too far? I dont know  you decide. And why is this stuff in our birthday cakes anyway?Even the cakes that Harris Teeter gets from a famous local bakery, Tizzerts, are just as bad as their store brand cakes because they also contain propylene glycol.Then you move on to Costco where the ingredient list is so long I literally had trouble keeping count  but its close to 80 ingredients! The majority of them are fake chemical fillers and food-like substances that are obviously not real food. (Notice the inflation  the price has gone up $3 dollars since the last time I bought one.)And whats so American about this All American chocolate cake? Gosh I didnt know you needed this many artificial colors (6 to be exact!) to color chocolate  I thought chocolate was already brown!The most upsetting  and most expensive  cakes were from The Fresh Market where I learned they arent made on premises, but instead by a bread and snack manufacturer named Vie de France. Again, this name fools you into thinking you are getting a higher quality or fancier product. I was impressed that The Fresh Market had a book of all the ingredients they willingly shared with me, but when I found the page labeled bakery goods free from trans fat (which had only a very small subset of the large amount of bakery goods in the book) I was deflated to say the least. Again, most of their cakes had propylene glycol too and lots of other preservatives.Regardless of these ingredients being clearly labeled on packaging and readily available, I see these types of cakes at almost every celebration I encounter  baby showers, bridal showers, childrens birthday parties, schools, work celebrations, retirement parties, etc. Childrens birthdays are probably the worst offender especially at school, since the opportunities to celebrate birthdays seem endless.The thought of consuming artificial flavors, artificial colors, transfat, and other food like chemicals made from petroleum willingly on the day we are supposed to be celebrating our life or our childrens lives seems a little ironic, doesnt it?The next time the occasion arises and its time to get a cake, here are 5 questions you need to ask your baker before reaching into your wallet:What ingredients do you use to make your cakes? Always ask this basic question  you may be appalled at what you find. For instance, many cake manufactures use no real sugar at all and the whole cake is made with high fructose corn syrup.What kind of flour do you use? The answer should be an unbleached flour, and if it is organic flour, even better!Do you use any preservatives in your cake? Propolyne glycol, parabens, and polysorbate are just a few of the laundry list of potential preservatives. If there are any of these ingredients or other preservatives used  I would keep looking.Do your cakes contain any partially hydrogenated oils (trans fat)? I would specifically say partially hydrogenated oil because legally food manufactures can still include this ingredient and say no trans fats at the same time.Do you use any artificial colors in your cakes? If you find out the cake is clean, but they still use artificial colors to decorate the cakes, ask for the cake to be made without them and then consider decorating the cake with organic candies, dried fruit, chocolate sauce and/or natural food colorings yourself.You make a decision to vote with your dollars every time you take out your wallet, whether you realize it or not. With the right information and enough conscious decision making about what we eat and how we spend our money, together we can make a change. They say you cant have your cake and eat it too  but why not?P.S.

Bojangles: Stop Routine Use of Antibiotics & Publish Your Ingredients – Share,http://foodbabe.com/bojanglesshare/,
The Unethical Tactics Of The Chemical Industry To Silence The Truth,http://foodbabe.com/2016/10/06/the-unethical-tactics-of-the-chemical-industry-to-silence-the-truth/,"I debated whether or not I should botherto share the information in this post with you. On one hand, I choose to put my focus and energy on the willing  the people who want to hear about whats really in their food and how they can make healthy changes to their lifestyle. On the other hand, there are some serious detractors that do not want the truth about our food to be heard. They are working as agents for the biotechand chemical industry to prevent information about the risks of using GMOs and their productsto come to light.I decided to publish this post because I want you to be awareof who these detractors are  and why they cant be trusted.Myrecent trip to Hawaii is the perfect example of how these detractors workA few months ago, I was invited to speak by Hawaii Center for Food Safety (Hawaii CFS) for an event called the Ethics of Eating. This is the Hawaii chapter of the Center For Food Safety (CFS), a nonprofit organization that promotes organic and sustainable agriculture. They fight back against the corrupt food system with petitions and have bravely taken legal action to force our government to create stronger regulations in regards to GMOs and chemicals that are harming our bodies, the environment,andfarm animals.Hawaii is a hot bed for the research and development of new chemically intensive GMOs and they are a testing ground for many experimental chemicals and crops  it is essentially ground-zero. Five of the largest chemical companies are suing the counties of Hawaii to keep their testing secret. Much of the work that Hawaii CFS is doing is focusing on the public health impacts of the pesticides and herbicides used on GMOs, and because of this, they are heavily targeted by the biotech companies who are profiting off of these chemicals and technologies. In 2015, over 100 Monsanto employees crashed a CFS presentationin Hawaiiin an attempt to intimidate the presenters.This is how biotech operatives operate, and CFSis very aware oftheir tactics. The people that work with CFS are very well respected and fearless activists in an increasingly aggressive climate.I was thrilled I was invited toHawaii to speak, yet I had no idea the absolute chaos that would ensue when they began promoting the event.As soon as my upcoming appearance was announced, the biotech industry quickly engaged and astroturfing began on the Hawaii CFS Facebook page. They began receiving hundreds of insulting and inflammatory comments  mainly criticizing me personally, characterizing me as hilariously uninformed, a crazy food blogger, and telling Hawaii CFS that they promote pseudoscience and fearmongering for bringing me in to speak.Vanis visit to Hawaii would unleash the most powerful display of the pro-GMO public relations machine that I have witnessed since taking my position with CFS. ~ Ashley Lukens, Director of Hawaii Center for Food SafetyThis just goes to show the great lengths that the GMO industry will go to in an attempt to discredit our workand make it difficult for anyone to ever ask me to speak again.They weredefaming me in an attempt to harm my future speaking engagements  but they didntstop there.24 hours before I was scheduledto take the stage, I was informed by Hawaii CFS thatthepro-GMO and satire activist group March Against Myths About Modification (MAMyths) launched a campaign to sabotage the event.The tickets to the event were free, but there were a limited quantity available as the venue could only accommodate a certain number of people. When word spread that I was coming to speak, MAMyths asked their followers to reserve blocks of tickets using fake names and fake emails so that it would appear to be sold out and that we would be speaking to an empty venue.They reserved over 1,500 tickets using names like Fraud Babe, Organic is Dumb, Susi Creamcheese, and Harriett Tubman from traced IP addresses outside of Hawaii and overseas in the United Kingdom, Australia, China, Thailand, Germany, Sweden, and the Netherlands.They were unsuccessful because Hawaii CFS discovered where these bogus requests were coming from and were able to easily cancel their reservations. Yet, it was clear that we struck a cord and they were trying to disrupt the event.Who is March Against Myths About Modification?MAMyths is a spin-off group and partner of Biology Fortifieda website which advocates strongly for GMOs and who has been working with the PR groupCornell Alliance For Sciencein protesting the bravework being done by U.S. Right to Know (USRTK) whichexposes hidden relationships between biotechcompanies, scientists, and PR firms.Biology Fortified received agrant from the American Society of Plant Biologists (ASPB)  a group sponsored by biotech companies.Theyclaim most of their operational funding comes fromindividual personal donations and that the authors are all unpaid volunteers.MAMyths describesthemselves as Radicals for science utilizing grassroots organization and direct action for social change and are basically satirizing the March Against Monsanto movement. They attend Marches in their I Love GMOs t-shirts and protest talks given by anti-GMO food activists such as Vandana Shiva.Industry front groups like the American Council for Science and Health (funded in part by Bayer and Syngenta) havepromoted MAMyths and encourage people to join them.They have also been featured in the Cornell Alliance for Science newsletter aPR arm of the biotechindustry that defends companies like Monsanto ruthlessly. Why dobiotech and agrichemical companies support MAMyths? Is there more than meets the eye to this relationship?The founders of MAMyths are Karl Haro von Mogel,Kavin Senapathy andDavid SutherlandKarl Haro von Mogel works exhaustively to defend biotechnology (GMOs) and has been called a leader by Cami Ryan, Social Science Lead at Monsanto. Yet, it is unclear how he makeshis living doing this work, as supposedly he is a volunteer for these organizations.Hewas on the faculty for the Biotechnology Literacy Project a boot camp thattrained individuals toengage the media and also to appear as experts in local legislative and government hearings, sponsored by the Monsanto-backed organizationAcademics Review. Karl also writes articles for other pro-Monsanto websites, such as Genetic Literacy Project.Why would Karl show up torecord our recent presentation?Karl showed up at my recent panel discussion with USRTK at the Heirloom Festival on September 8th, 2016 in California and proceeded to film and record our presentation (on 2 devices) even after he was asked to stop recording. Did he travel all the way from his hometown in Wisconsin just to record our discussion? Who paid for him to be there and why?This is not the first time he has tried to harass activists at this event.He did the same in 2014 and offered toreimburse the entrance fee of the event.This begs the question again, who is MAMyth funded by?Kavin Senapathy:Who is she really defending?Kavin likes to call herself a science defender and swings a cartoon sword, but she is not a scientist by trade. Kavin studied Business Marketing atUniversity of Wisconsin. Sheworks as an Advisor forher fathers company, Genome International Corporation, which holds several patents that are likely licensed to biotech companies. She also works as a writer for several pro-GMO blogs like Grounded Parents and Skepchick.She once emailed me for comment on a story she was writing and refused to answer my questions about her conflicts of interest.Just like her friend Kevin Folta, shedenies industry ties but a picture says a thousand wordsIsnt it a bit strange to see her hanging out withMonsantos social media and PR friendsif she has no ties to them?Kavin is a spokeswoman for Chow Babe hate Facebook page.Kavin has taken a big interest in me personally. She spends a verysignificantamount of timecriticizingme and the work of the Food Babe Army.Sheactsas the spokesperson for a Facebook page that was created solely to criticize and parody me all day long, every day, sometimes being severelyoffensive.Kavin co-authored an entire book against the food revolution and meHer social media presencegained the attention of the NPR  The Salt Blog, allowing her to be interviewed and quoted in a heavily circulated hit piece against me. Since focusing on mehad gotten Kavin so much attention, she proceeded to co-author an entire book about me called Fear Babe, which includes a forward written by none other than Kevin Folta  a scientist that was caught red-handed accepting cash from Monsanto for his outreach.Kavin is a busy girl!Spending so much of her time trying to discredit me and our movement. Youve got to ask yourself, what motivates her to do this?More importantly: Whydoes Forbes allowKavin to write articles for them without appropriate conflict of interest disclosure?Kavinhas recently published several articles inForbes (a websitethat reaches millions) in which she spews hate fororganic food and farming, and bashes non-GMO food activists like me over and over again:3 Tactics Donald Trump Shares With Dr. Oz, The Food Babe, And Other Snake Oil Salesmen  Forbes, 10/5/16The Food Babe Is A Bully And Cotton Incorporated Isnt Going To Take It  Forbes, 5/27/16Del Monte Joins Food Babe Army, Shuns Fruit-Saving Technology  Forbes, 4/5/16The Toxic Chemical Hypocrisy Of Food Babe, Joseph Mercola And Mark Hyman  Forbes, 12/3/15In Kavins libelous articles, her sources are PR operatives and peoplewho are paid to protect the profits of the big food and GMO companies.For instance, shecites expertsfrom:U.S. Farmers And Ranchers Alliance (funded byDupont and Monsantoand run by the PR firm Ketchum)Cotton Inc. (a trade group for cotton growers who have received technology from Monsanto)An advisor for the Calorie Control Council (a trade group for artificial sweetener manufacturers that is run by the PR firmKellen Company)Farmer who sells Monsantos GMO seedsAre these people Independent Experts? Absolutely not!In her earlier Forbes pieces, sheco-wrote themwith Henry Miller, a former FDA employee who founded theOffice of Biotechnology, and is also associated with several front groups that ferociously defend the use of GMOs and pesticides. His resume includes accolades from Philip Morris for defending thetobacco industry.Henry has been writingpro-GMO articles for Forbes for over 10 years. Why did Henry takeKavinunder his wing? Did he help her secure a position at Forbes? Does Forbesknow about her relationships to Monsanto and PR firms? Do they know that she heads up a Facebook group that works with front groups? Are her conflicts of interest disclosed? Does Forbesknow shes the leader of a Facebook group encouraging people to use fake names to get fake tickets for an event to harass activists? How can Forbes allow someone to write for them who engages in unethical tacticslike this?Contact Forbes and ask them to disclose Kavins ties to industryIf you think this behavior is as shady as I do, join me in contacting Forbes here and letting them know how you feel about Kavin and her undisclosed ties to the industry.We need to speak up when we see corruptreporting to encourage media outlets to do better due diligence and toinspirereal investigative journalism. I tried to get her to disclose her ties, but my email went unanswered. After my questions about her conflicts of interest went unanswered she continued to write defamatory pro-industry articles about our work without contacting me for comment.Whoelse has beenbehind the wheelat MAMyths?Reportedly, asocial media consultant and contributor for MAMyths is Jayson Merkley, who has a background in writing and marketing. He isa Fellow of the prestigious-sounding group The Cornell Alliance for Science,in which hecompleted their leadership training.Who is the Cornell Alliance For Science, and why do they train leadersto harass food activists?The Cornell Alliance For Science sounds prestigious, right??? In reality, they are arelatively new front group leading the charge in the pro-GMO propaganda machine.They are thepublic relations arm for the agrichemical industryinsidiouslyhosted at one of the most renowned universities in the country.Their goalis to depolarize the GMO debate and their stance is squarely pro-GMO and pro-chemical. The Allianceclaims to have zero industry ties, yet their partners include several organizations funded by biotechnology companies. For instance, one partner is ISAAA, whoreceives funding fromMonsanto and CropLife, a trade organization for biotech.See how they try to obscureaffiliations like these?They want to gag activists into silence and refuse to debate REAL independent scientists.Although their stated mission is to depolarize the GMO debate, when it comes down to it they refuse to debate scientists or activists who are critical of GMOs unless they are in complete control. A GMO debate was organized on the CornellUniversity campus, and no one from Cornell Alliance For Science or Cornell facultywould agree to debate the benefits of GMOs, despite numerous email requests by the student coordinator. They didnt even need to travel! The debate was brought to their campus but they refused.Could it be that they know their arguments are defenseless?They recently got called out by 67 New York State farmers who sent a letter to Cornell, urging them to evict the Alliance for Science for theirbiased and unscientific attitude towards GMOs.Nothing in the materials or programs of The Alliance for Science is anything but entirely pro-biotechnology. They are without balance or significant critical evaluation of the range of agricultural systems and technologies that exist in food production today. ~Elizabeth Henderson, organic farmer from Wayne County, New YorkMeanwhile they are training leaders to exploit the media.The CornellAlliance for Scienceprovidesleadership training to students, farmers, and scientists,many of whom have a background in marketing, business, or journalism, to usetheir communication skills topromote the use of GMOs along with chemical-intrusive agriculture and to slam activists that are fighting for more sustainable practices. They also provide journalism fellowships with cash awards to promote in-depth contextualized reporting. They put on a front that they are activists trying to help farmers, when they are actually just conducting PR work forthe biotech industry.Its disgusting and appalling.There are several scientists, bloggers, farmers and social media personalitiesthat appear to be legitimate, but have strong ties (and sometimes covert financial relations) with thebiotech industry and their PR firms.Usuallytheir relationship to each other runs deep and they take specific steps to hide their affiliations with the industry. Their goal is to fool the masses into believing industry propaganda.The industry has done consumer researchwhich showsthatmost people tend to trust farmers and publicly-fundedscientists for information about GMOs, especially if they are a mom. Armed with this information, theindustry hides their tracks and triesto fool the masses with front groups largely comprised ofuniversity scientists, moms, and farmers.Is this who you trust for information about GMOs?{Above slides presented by the front group Center for Food Integrity at IFT16}The makings of a GMO industry front group and how they hide their affiliations to the industry:1. A biotechor agrochemicalcompany donates money to a foundation or charity that will give the appearance of being independent, but will act as a funnel for their money going forward.2. This foundation will go on to provide funding for a new scientific organization to be established to communicate science to the public. Other times, a PR firm is hired to create this organization. They may even create multiple child organizations down the line to further hide their connections to biotech. These are all front groups. See exampleshere.3. This new front group will create a respectable looking website and social media accounts, stating that their mission is to spread the truth about science and food.4. The front groupwilltrain farmers, bloggers, and scientists (if they are a mom, this is a bonus!) on how to work with them to help spread their messages about the safety of GMOs, food additives, factory farming practices, or pesticides. Sometimes they are paid or given other accommodations to do this work for the organization.5. The organization will call those that they work with andtrainexperts. Theywill recommend them to journalists who are writing for major media publicationsand their ties to the industry are not readily disclosed. They will be touted as independent.6. These trainedfarmersand scientists go out and write for their own blogs and sometimes branch out, writing for bigger publications such as Forbes. Likewise, they create Facebook groups and pages that will be used to poke fun at activists (such as myself) and try to disrupt the work we are doing. There are countless food-related satire and astroturf pages like this online right now.This process has been duplicated dozens of times and will continue as long as they are not exposed!As you can see, these peopleare just agents for biotech. Whether or not they are paid directly by them, they are doing their bidding.I think it is absolutely mandatory forjournalists to investigate and further probe these connections. Judging by the way these groups and individualsmock me publicly andtroll ourwork, it is clear they are working together and havean agenda.The bottomline? We want a safer and healthier food system, and some people want to keep the food system just like it is today  broken, corrupt and full of unregulated food additives and chemicals that only improve the bottom line of food and biotech companies and not our health. We clearly have different missions.I hope that this information gives you more courage to useyour voice online to elicit change. If you do find yourself the victim of their trolling behavior, heres what to do. They want us to stop and be silenced. We truly are creating a safer food system, and they are freaking out!!! That is why they are spewing so much vitriol towards us  they simply have no other options left.Please share this post!The more people aware of these disgusting tactics, the better we are equipped to determine fact from fiction when it comes to finding ultimate health  which is our goal after all.Xo,VaniP.S.

Real Life Stories From Inspiring Women Who Eat The Food Babe Way!,http://foodbabe.com/2016/07/27/real-life-stories-inspiring-women-eat-food-babe-way/,"Just to show you how much it can change your life to eat The Food Babe Way, I thought Id share with you some of the incredible emails that Ive received recently. Each of these women have inspiringstories to tell about the transformation they experienced in their bodies and health when they stopped eating processed foods full of additives and filled up their plates with real nutritious food instead! As you read through their stories, Im sure that you will recognize yourself in some of them  I know I do!Kerry: My goal is not to be perfect but to be wise in my food choicesI started my journey at 216, and as of this morning, I am down 9.6 pounds which is great. What I am most proud of is taking control of my health and eating habits. When I ate according to the food guide for two weeks I felt great and had energy and my headaches disappeared. When I slipped back into my drive through habit and ate processed foods I felt bloated and crappy and my headaches returned. There is no doubt in my mind that eating organically as much as possible is beneficial. Sure, it was expensive at first to stock the cabinets and very time consuming to go through my kitchen and throw out the junk. My goal is not to be perfect but to be wise in my food choices and take responsibility for my current condition (which is improving).The best part about changing my health is cooking. I forgot how much I like to cook and using the meal prep guide is fun and keeps me on track while looking ahead. I space my times for eating to every four hours and when I am tempted to eat, I ask myself why? Is it out of habit, boredom, or am I eating to postpone an unpleasant task? If I am really hungry I eat and dont worry about it.Kraft Macaroni and Cheese is one of my very favorite foods, but I no longer eat it (per my agreement) I guess I should say, I no longer consider this my favorite food. I ate a so called healthy burger and was amazed how salty it tasted. My taste buds are changing. I love using new spices such as curry in my chicken and having cucumber in my green drink and putting fresh ginger in hot water for tea.The Food Babe is just what we need. I will become more of a testimony to my family and friends once they see me gain health, vitality, and lose weight. They have heard my diet plans so much they are immune to what I say. They just kind of pat me on the head with a There, there, God bless her, she keeps trying. ~ KerryEllen: My taste buds have changed to crave all the wonderful nutrients I allow themAlthough my mother instilled healthy eating habits (she was beyond her time!) from a young age, I came to America from England 39 years ago and continued (for the most part) with the values instilled in me. Over the years I, like most other Americans, didnt realize the food industry had added all the toxins and chemicals into our foods until a few years ago when I was shocked at my weight gain and decided to go back to the principals I had been taught. During this time I came across The Food Babe (amongst others) and started to follow her teachings becoming aware of all the dreadful processes in the American food industry today. Armed with this proven new method of approaching food, I was living, breathing testament to the way we eat and wanted to share this with everyone I came in contact with, especially those near and dear to me.Other than being an example of good health and the foods I allow in my temple and gifting The Food Babe Way to many of those I love, unfortunately this has not been received as I would like and have come to realize that if anyone is interested in doing something good for themselves, I am there to help and advise but not to force it on anyone, however much I love them.I love how I feel, huge amounts of energy (walking average of 7-10 miles per day), dropped 40 lbs and of course the way my taste buds have changed to crave all the wonderful nutrients I allow them. Some days its a challenge to stay the course without seeming either rude or smug but I have been doing this long enough now that it is getting easier and easier especially eliminating most grains and unnecessary carbs. I am blessed in that I dont have to deal with any health issues but I believe this would not be the case without the changes in my diet.I have shared all of The Food Babes eating guides and books with many friends and family members and mostly show by example as I realize not everyone is going to be receptive to this. Everyone is on a different course in their lives and if I can help by sowing seeds, with The Food Babes help, that is the best I can do. ~ EllenCharla: My blood tests had improved unbelievably. My cholesterol went from 215 to 145 and Im NOT on any cholesterol medicationIve been T2 Diabetic for almost 10 years now caused by large doses of Prednisone. When I was finally able to afford healthcare and stop going to Mexico to buy medicine I got back to my doctor to have regular blood tests. I was staying in Texas for the holidays and there was just TOO MUCH TEMPTATION all over the house. I couldnt say no. In January, I got back to my doctor and he looked at my blood tests and couldnt believe how bad they were. He said, YOU HAVE TO CHANGE WHAT YOU EAT! He even asked if I drink, which I dont, because of the decline in my liver. I was raised with all vegetables having a white or cheese sauce, potato chips, cokes & canned fruit.On the drive back to Texas I heard Vani on health radio. She just clicked in my head. I got to Tucson, found a book store and bought her book. That night I laid in bed all night reading. The next day I found a small health food store and bought organic fruit. I started eating organic lettuce, meats with no antibiotics or preservatives, organic cheeses, no prepared foods, nothing with food coloring (which I was already convinced causes ADHD). I only lost 5-6 pounds because my activity level was still really low due to arthritis and injuries from a car accident but still I was feeling better. In April, I went back to the doctor and my blood tests had improved unbelievably. My cholesterol went from 215 to 145 and Im NOT on any cholesterol medication. I truly believe that following Vani to the best of my ability (and my ability to eat fruits and vegetables is not really good) but I am determined to beat this!!!I am back living in San Diego where people DO eat healthier and cleaner so I have to be honest and say Vani and my community have helped me! But I do believe in Vani and what she stands for. I really havent gone to fast food in years but am so ashamed at all the fast food I gave my kids growing up because our schedule was insane.I love shopping for healthy food and reading the labels. I HAVE to concentrate on my diabetes and get it completely under control. I HAVE to learn to LIKE fresh fruits and vegetables. I do have more energy. I do feel better. Its up to me now to do this completely. Vani has given me the tools. I need to continue using them.There are a lot of haters on the internet and most of them are scientific types. They slam Vani because she doesnt have a degree in science or food technology but I will argue with each and every one of them because I am living proof, emphasis on LIVING, that Vani has her Masters in Common Sense. Thank you Vani. Your book makes great birthday presents!!! ~ CharlaShirley Anne: I am an old lady of 81+ years and walk twice a day every dayThis is a very short story as I am a fairly recent reader of all things Vani sends out through emails. I am an old lady of 81+ years and walk twice a day every day. I have long term osteoarthritis (40 years) and it covers from my neck to my feet & ankles. I must exercise every day for all parts of my body just to keep moving and not in a wheelchair. Move it or lose it.I share any news from Vani with my family and friends. Not everyone is as excited about this info as I am, nevertheless, I share and they can use the info or not. Their decision.My favorite part of changing my health and food habits is the excitement of learning new ways to make old favorites with organic and healthy vegetables. Not much red meat but lots of chicken. I need to up my fish intake  will work on that one. Thanks to Vani I am so much more connected to eating right and reading labels on everything.This winter when the Pennsylvania winters are so long and icy; it is not feasible to walk safely on ice. I took to the internet for all new healthy soups  none of these did I make in the past for my young family  we ate old standbys like vegetable with lots of beef, bean soup with lots of ham  you get the picture. NOW this past winter I have made soups with organic beans, lentils, quinoa, farro and all other ancient grains. I live in an apartment with a neighbor across the hall in her last year of college, so I shared my soups with her and she was a happy young friend. I used a rebounder for winter moving about when the weather was bad. This year in a new locale has been a busy and rewarding one with my turnover in cooking healthy. I credit you with this. Thanks and God bless. ~ S.A.Amelia: Its never too late to improve ones healthIhave read and was told by my doctor years ago, sugar, and salt are killers as well as processed foods. I am 84 yrs old and ate healthy (my moms cooking) over the years. I fell into sweets and fast foodswhen I was working, now knowing all the info regarding chemicals, etc, I have cut back on sugar about 90%, no salt and no processed foods.Some people asked why am I depriving myself of foods I love, at my age. With my heart and stroke issues I do not want to die hooked up to machines in hospital, its never too late to improve ones health so Iam trying to eat more veggies, fruit, hardly any red meat, little poultry, no seafood (deathly allergic).I omitted processed foods and I am now beginning to regain my energy. I have health issues that keep me from doing too much but all in all between giving up sweets, eating lots more veggies then before, and fruit, I know I am going to be fine, by the Grace of God. I am still driving, very little running around and miss dancing. I really feel keeping away from the chemicals in foods is the reason I am doing this well.

See What Happens When Twins Makeover Their Diet The Food Babe Way! {Lisa & Laurie’s Story},http://foodbabe.com/2016/04/19/two-twins-makeover-their-diet/,"This week has been a bit surreal to me. Im celebrating the 5 year anniversary of FoodBabe.com (yeah!) and reflecting on all that has happened since I first started this blog. Never in my wildest dreams did I envision all that the Food Babe Army has come to be! Changing multi-billion dollar corporations for the better, educating families across the world about whats in their foodand changing so many individual lives. To say I have my dream job, would be an understatement  theres nothing more in the world I would rather do.The most rewarding part of it all is YOU. When you send me an emailand tell me that one of our campaigns has raised your awareness about a crazy food additive in our food supply that you now avoid or that you have been following the 21 habits in my New York Times Best Selling bookThe Food Babe Way and feel and look so much better or that you are loving the recipes and tips in myEating Guides it totally makes my day and lets me know that what Im doing is making a real life-changing difference.That being said, I have a super inspiring story from a reader (actually two readers!) to share with you today! I know we all could use a little bit of motivation and I love reading real life stories of people who have succeeded at changingto a healthier diet and lifestyle  and are reaping the benefits! Dont you?Im going to start sharing more stories like these with you all, so get ready!Last SummerI started communicating with Lisa, who reached out and told methat she was doing something very exciting. Lisa, a 39 year old identical twin, decided to do a Food Babe Way challenge with her sister Laurie for the next 6 months.Lisa was already a dedicated Food Babe reader and would be following Food Babe eating habits, while her sister was a bit resistant to change and intended to continue with her typical lifestyle.I provided Lisa with a Food Babe Eating Guide Program Membership to help give her all of the tools that she would need to be successful and she really has been! Im so floored and inspired by what a difference they both have made and Im sure that once you hear their stories you will feel inspired too!Meet Lisa & Laurie:Lisas story:My name is Lisa, and I live in Ballantyne, NC. I am 40 years old, a wife, and mother of 3. I work full-time as a nanny of 2 children, and also attend college. I am pursuing a career in Nursing.Last year I noticed my body was changing  my normal routine of being active only occasionally, and not paying attention to the foods I was eating on a daily basis was beginning to show. Six months before my 40th birthday I decided it was time to make a change!I came across the blog written by Lisa Leake, from 100 Days of Real Food.I was so impressed with the meals, especially the lunch ideas for my kids, I took the pledge and my journey to eating healthy began. I became acquainted with Vani Hari on the blog, began researching, and discovered foodbabe.com  this took my eating habits to an entirely new level. The research Vani does and the impact she has on so many lives immediately drew me in and furthered my commitment to living an entirely healthy and new way of life..the foodbabe way!Not only have I seen improvements in my body, skin, and hair, but I feel happy! I used to feel emotional a lot, stressed out, tired, and just unhappy with everything around me. I can only express that I feel peaceful, completely less stressed, even with the added activities and more of a busy schedule than I had before. I find time to work out consistently, cook for my family, and have an overall happier family as a result.The most important thing I have learned is to read my labels. I am now aware of the harmful chemicals in our food and products we use. Also I have learned the difference between GMO and NON-GMO, organic and non-organic. My main goal is to just eat food that is living and will take care of my body.My sister Laurie and I challenged each other to making the biggest improvements we could in the 6 months leading up to our 40th birthday in February. We formed a facebook page to allow others to follow our effort and also to drive some additional accountability. We both saw such great results and had so many friends interested, we decided to continue on to June 1st. We have an amazing group that joined us on our continued journey to a healthy lifestyle  for me its the foodbabe way all the way!~ LisaLauries story:My name is Laurie, I am 40 years old, have been married for 17yrs. and am the proud mama of three. I am a survivor of depression and today I celebrate being medication free for 8 years. Battling depression without medication was the first step I took on my journey to being whole and healthy. I was blessed with good genetics, for the first 26 yrs. I never exercised and I ate whatever I wantedsome could say I was lucky, but I was nave. I had no idea that another battle was just beginning.my battle to become healthy! An obvious first step I had to change my diet. Green leafy foods, well, lets just say they werent a staple in my diet. Fortunately my twin sister Lisa had begun her own journey by following the foodbabe. I am not fond of following rulesI am, quite frankly, a rebellious rule breaker. For months I thought my sister was crazy with all the facts she would send me. I knew I needed to change my diet but it was not until I educated myself on what I was putting into my body that I came to appreciate the value of nutrition. It was then that I joined the foodbabe army! Besides diet I had to exercise, so I started with yoga. I thought yoga would be easy, but quickly found out yoga is not for the weak! At the age of 37 I became a certified yoga instructor. I became strong physically and during the meditation/quiet time my mind was healing too. My desire to look cute in my yoga pants was additional encouragement to eat healthy, but it was a struggle and took years even to incorporate diet and exercise improvements into my daily life. Ive come to realize though, that when you know better you tend to do better. Last November I hit a wall. Though I was now 39 yrs.old and medication free, I was not feeling good about any area of my health. I believed I could do better. Lisa was facing the same wall. We challenged each other to a competition Twin vs. Twin fight to forty. For accountability we posted our challenge on FB and quickly had followers. It worked! Lisa and I celebrated our 40th birthday with great results. We were so encouraged that we decided to do the challenge again and to invite our FB friends to join in. The interest was overwhelming and Lisa and I quickly found that this community of smart, strong women were struggling just like us. Together we celebrate each others accomplishments, share recipes and workouts, but most of all we share our hearts, and I am privileged to travel this journey alongside them. That, the unexpected privilege, was the trophy I received at the end of our challenge. I began on a quest for a six pack, and ended with the blessing of communion. On this journey, I have learned to love myselfin a way I never did before. I feel like I am just getting warmed up, that this is just the beginning. Im pretty excited to meet the Laurie that has yet to be revealed. Looking back I can see a pattern; when I reached a goal I quickly set a new one. These became milestones on my journey thus far, they are permanent marks of great progress on my road to recovery and living a life of wholeness and health. They remind me just how important taking one more step can be.Stay tuned! ~ Laurie (changing the face of the desperate housewife, one workout and meal at a time)Laurie (Left), Lisa (Right)A Healthy Outside Starts From The Inside!I hope Lisa & Lauries story inspires you to know that you can make a change.

"When You See What’s In These Popular Fast Food Buns, You’ll Run!",http://foodbabe.com/2016/01/27/when-you-see-whats-in-these-popular-fast-food-buns-youll-run/,"Lets discuss a basic concept about eating real food.Food has to rot! If it doesnt, weve got a huge problem!Real food naturally goes bad  thats what it is supposed to do. So when I see bread that lasts over 10 days, I start to squirm thinking about all the additives it must contain to keep it looking fresh. Bread only hasa fewbasic ingredients: flour, yeast, water, salt  and then maybe some fat (oil or butter) and sugar. However, the buns at popular fast food restaurants are designed to last much longer than fresh baked buns, sometimes longer than 2 weeks. In order to achieve this long shelf life that improves profitability they have to pump those buns up withartificial, man-made, chemical ingredients.The real question is, what are these chemicals doing to our bodies?How does our health reactwhen we load them up day after day with diets full of GMO soybean oil, azodicarbonamide, calcium peroxide, high fructose corn syrup, caramel color made from ammonia, and other artificial ingredients? Couldthis be the real reason that so many people feel better after they stop eating bread? In this comparison youll see that popular fast food buns are nearly identical and carry many of the same toxic additives!AzodicarbonamideThis is the Yoga Mat dough conditioner that we petitioned Subway to remove from their bread in 2014 (and succeeded!). This additive is banned in Europe and Australia, and The Center For Science In The Public Interest has called on the FDA to ban it in the U.S. as well. The World Health Organization has linked it to respiratory issues, allergies and asthma. When the azodicarbonamide in bread is baked, there is research that links it to tumor development and cancer. According toDr. John Coupland,small amounts of semicarbazide and urethane have been shown to form from azodicarbonamide breakdown during baking and these compounds may pose a health risk.GUILTY BUNS: Burger King, McDonalds (McRib bun), Dairy Queen and Arbys. (Chick-fil-A removed it after our petition to Subway).Monoglycerides and DiglyceridesThis emulsifier is a byproduct of oil processing  including partially hydrogenated canola and soybean oils  which contain artificial trans fat that is detrimental to our health. The consumption of artificial trans fat is strongly correlated with an increased risk of type 2 diabetes and heart disease. The CDC has linked it to at least 20,000 heart attacks per year and the Institute of Medicine says trans fats have no known health benefit and there is no safe level to eat. GUILTY BUNS: Shake Shack, Dairy Queen, KFC, Burger King, Wendys, McDonalds, Jack In The Box and Arbys.High Fructose Corn Syrup The worst of refined sugars, this sweetener increases appetite, and the risk of weight gain, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, cancer and dementia. Fast food companies use this man-made sugar because it has a longer shelf life and inhibits microbial spoilage.Almost 50% of high fructose corn syrup samples have been shown to be contaminated with toxic mercury.GUILTY BUNS: KFC, Burger King, Wendys, McDonalds, Jack In The Box, Dairy Queen and Arbys.Soybean OilAlmost every fast food bun on this list contains this cheap GMO oil that increases the risk of inflammation, cardiovascular disease, cancer, and autoimmune diseases.GUILTY BUNS: In-N-Out Burger, Dairy Queen, KFC, Burger King, Wendys, McDonalds, Jack In The Box, Arbys, and Carls Jr.Calcium PeroxideThis bleaching agent and dough conditioner is banned inforeign countries including China (and also from some natural food stores like Whole Foods). Its use is a sign that the bun is heavily processed and not something I want to put in my body. Its also not a necessary ingredient. McDonalds doesnt use calcium peroxidein their buns in the U.K.so why do they use it here?GUILTY BUNS: Chick-Fil-A, McDonalds, Dairy Queen, Jack In The Box, and Arbys.Sucralose This artificial sweetener (a.k.a Splenda) is added to KFCs buns even though they already add high fructose corn syrup. Research out of Europe showed rats developed leukemia after consuming sucralose.GUILTY BUNS: KFC.Caramel ColorThere are 4 different types of caramel color used by the food industry.Class III and Class IV caramel color (commonly used in bread)aremade from ammonia and contain the byproduct 4-MEI, a known cancer risk. We contacted Arbys and asked them what class of caramel color they use and have not heard back from them yet,butwill updatehereas needed.Natural orArtificial FlavorsAny time you see flavors on an ingredient list be aware that you dont really know what you are eating. According to the Environmental Working Group, every flavor has their own secret list of up to 100 ingredients, includingsynthetic chemicals such as the solvent propylene glycol or the preservative BHA as well as GMO-derived ingredients. Flavorscan also include excitotoxins like MSG that cause your taste buds to experience irresistibility when it comes to food.GUILTY BUNS: Carls Jr., Dairy Queen, KFC, Wendys, and Arbys.Acesulfame Potassium According to the Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI) this artificial sweetener is anything but safe. CSPI reported the safety tests of acesulfame-K that were conducted in the 1970s were inadequate. Specifically, two rat studies suggest that the additive might cause cancer, but these studies were never properly addressed by the FDA before they approved the substance.GUILTY BUNS: Carls Jr.Neotame This is a relatively new and rarely used artificial sweetener that can be found in Carls Jr.s buns. Some health experts warn that this chemical sweetener is more harmful to our health than aspartame  a neurotoxin  but its safety is still up in the air. Just like experts believedthat Sucralose was safe when it first came out, people trusted what they were told and consumed it for years before it was linked to leukemia. I dont know about you, but I dont see any reason to consume a risky chemical invention that is unnecessarily added to food, especially since it has zero health benefits!GUILTY BUNS: Carls Jr.DATEMThis acronym stands for Diacetyl Tartaric Acid Esters of Monoglycerides, and isa dough conditioner that is usually derived from soybean or canola oil (GMO crops). Just like mono and diglycerides, this ingredient can be a hidden form of deadly trans fat in our food that most people dont know about.GUILTY BUNS:Shake Shack, Burger King, Wendys, McDonalds, Jack In The Box, Arbys, and Carls Jr.Calcium PropionateThis mold-inhibitor was found in almost every fast food bun on our list  even at In-N-Out Burger!Calcium Propionate is considered a safer preservative, but beware that research published in the Journal of Paediatric Child Health links it to irritability, restlessness, inattention and sleep disturbance in some children and long term consumption of calcium propionate has also been shown to damage the stomach lining and induce ulcers.GUILTY BUNS:In-N-Out Burger, KFC, Dairy Queen, Burger King, Chick-Fil-A, Wendys, McDonalds, Jack In The Box, Arbys, and Shake Shack.All that  and I barely even mentioned the GMOsYoull almost always find at least one of these ingredients derived fromGMO crops in a fast food bun:Corn SyrupHigh Fructose Corn SyrupSugar (from sugar beets)Cottonseed OilSoybean OilCanola OilMaltodextrinDextroseDATEMMono and DiglyceridesGMOs are concerning because theycancontain glyphosate residues from the Roundup weed killer that is prevalently used on them. Glyphosate was deemed aprobable carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is also linked tokidney disease,birth defects, andautism.Thankfully, I cant remember the last time I ate a burger from one of these fast food places, but Id go back in time and knock it out of my hands now if I could!If you or any of your loved ones are still hitting up the fast food drive thru, please share this post with them!Xo,Vani22.9K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

Dissecting Thin Mints Girl Scout Cookies {It Isn’t Pretty!},http://foodbabe.com/2016/01/19/dissecting-thin-mint-girl-scout-cookies-isnt-pretty/,"There is no denying that Girl Scout Cookies are delicious but when you find out whats actually in them, you might think twice about eating them ever again. I used to be a Girl Scout and if I knew what I know now about food and nutrition, I would have boycotted selling them until the ingredients changed.We all know cookies are cookies and they are a treat that isnt meant to be healthy. But, thecookies I like to eat have basic ingredients  flour, sugar, butter or coconut oil, baking soda and eggs. If youve been to any grocery store lately, youll see that there are tons of options that are just that. So, whyis it that the Girl Scouts getlittle girls to hawk these cookies year after year that are filled with artificial and questionable ingredients?Just take a look at the ingredients, they speak for themselves!Sugar made from GMO Sugar BeetsThe sugar in Girl Scout Cookies doesnt allcome from sugar cane, but instead from genetically modified sugar beets. This type of sugar cancontain glyphosate residues from the Roundup weed killer that is prevalently used on them. Glyphosate was deemed a probable carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO), and is also linked to kidney disease, birth defects, and autism. If you think a little bit of herbicide residue in your cookie isnt something to worry about, consider this, soon after Monsanto got approval to market GMO sugar beets for public consumption, they requested that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) increase the limit of allowable glyphosate residues in sugar beet roots from 0.2 ppm to 10 ppm  thats a 5000% increase! Given the prevalence of Roundup-Ready crops in America, just how much of this stuff are we really eating? Not to mention glyphosate pollution of our water, soil and air that is affecting us all. High Fructose Corn SyrupThere are two versions of of Girl Scout Cookies made by 2 different bakers. Although the ingredients are nearly identical, one version of the Thin Mints cookie (and some other cookie varieties) is sweetened with High Fructose Corn Syrup. This sweetener can be contaminated with toxic mercury and has been shown to contribute to type II diabetes, especially in children.Partially Hydrogenated OilsThe Girl Scouts use a sneaky FDA loophole to claim all of their cookies contain 0 Grams Trans Fat per serving, while some of them (including Thin Mints made by Little Brownie Bakers) actually contain partially hydrogenated oil withartificial trans fat. They get away with this because the FDA allows any product is labeled 0 grams of Trans Fat to contain up to 0.5 grams of trans fat per serving(which is only 4 Thin Mints). Yet, the Institute of Medicine says that no amount of trans fat safe to eat becausetrans fat islinked to thousands of cases of heart disease. Please note  The FDA is requiring all food manufactures to remove trans fats by 2018, but food companies can still petition the FDA for a special permit to continue using it.Enriched White FlourThis type of flour has been stripped of natural nutrients so it has no redeeming qualities and is essentially dead food. So, they enrich it with synthetic vitamins (niacin, reduced iron, thiamine mononitrate, riboflavin, folic acid) that are not naturally derived. These fake nutrients are engineered in a lab from such things as coal tar, ammonia, formaldehyde, GMO bacteria, and petroleum.Artificial Flavors The type of flavors used by the Girl Scouts is a top secret man-made concoction of chemicals. Not only do you not know what chemicals you are really eating when you eat artificial flavors, but they are linked to allergic reactions. Class IV Caramel ColorThere are 4 different types of caramel color used by the food industry, and Class IV caramel color is added to some Girl Scout cookies like Thin Mints. Class IV caramel color is made from ammonia and contains the byproduct 4-MEI, a known cancer risk.And if Thin Mints are not your favorite Girl Scout Cookie, Samoas are even worse!And if you like Tagalongs  heres the deal with those:Do we really need to buy these cookies to support the Girl Scouts?When the Girl Scouts come knocking, consider a donation or volunteering for the Girl Scouts instead of buying these cookies. Please also consider signing this petition started by a little Girl Scout asking for organic and non-GMO cookies!Voting with your dollars is not always popular or easy but surely sends the right message to these bakers that continue to use these controversial ingredients.If you know someone who is selling or eating Girl Scout Cookies, please share this post with them. The more people that know the truth, the better!Xo,Vani52.9K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

“I felt hopelessly addicted to food…” but not anymore!,http://foodbabe.com/2015/09/15/addicted-to-food/,"How do we decide what to eat when we live in a world full of toxic food? All it takes is a little planning and action.Many of you are upset about whats happening in the food industry and I dont blame you.Upon reading my investigations and finding out the truth, you say:Tell me what I can eat!Thats my favorite brand  oh no!I was addicted to that!?I just fed that <insert product> to my child this morning  what am I suppose to do now?Well, I have a solution and I want to make sure you know about it!The only person who can control your health is you. I didnt understand this growing up. Instead, I believed what everyone else around me was telling me. I looked up to several authoritative figures, organizations and companies and blindly followed them as many people do today.The food industry and organizations like Weight Watchers told me I could eat anything I wanted as long as I checked the calories or points and fat grams. I followed their advice and found myself always in a struggle to maintain my weight. The advice left me with no energy and feeling hungry all the time.I outsourced my meals to restaurants like Subway that told me I would eat fresh and lose weight like Jared if I ordered their sandwiches. I believed them and so many other restaurant chains that were serving me industrial chemicals instead of real food.For so long, I looked to everyone else for answers. I didnt know that everything I believed for most of my life would be turned upside down once I started to investigate this for myself.My biggest lesson learned during all of this discovery has been:I cannot outsource my health or my food.As a result, I started to learn how to cook and how to prepare my own food as much as possible  and this is how The Food Babe Eating Guide Membership was born.Over the last few years I have learned that this lifestyle is not for everyone. Not everyone is ready to take back control of their food and stop outsourcing it to corporations. Some refuse to believe whats really happening to our food supply and thats ok. But, what inspires me most is the people courageous enough to take back control and serve as the change we all wish to be in the world! Jennifer is a perfect example of that.Jennifer has been aFood Babe Eating Guidemember for over a year now. When I learned about her amazing transformation, I asked her if it would be ok for me to share her story and letter with you. I love all that she has accomplished and she is the perfect example of what can happen when you take back control of your food. Obviously, I cant guarantee these results for you withthis program, but this really embodies what can happen if you make a commitment to yourself and stop making excuses. Not only has she clearly lost weight (66 pounds!), but she now glows from the inside out and has changed her familys life forever.Heres what Jennifer has to say:I am so excited to have the opportunity to share my story with you and to thank you for all the hard work that you have done to help encourage me and many others.Let me start by giving you a bit of my history. I have struggled with my weight in my thoughts and self image or actually being overweight most of my life. I have never liked vegetables. My diet mostly consisted of fast food hamburgers, chicken nuggets, fries, and pizza. When I would eat at home it would be boxed foods or some other version of fried and processed foods. I drank sodas and juices and very little water. I have always been an athletic energetic type of person. I was a cheerleader and a gymnast and so I managed my weight pretty well. I can say that looking back but when I was looking in the mirror at that age I always felt fat.When I went on to college my activities became a lot more sedentary and the weight began to stick. I gained 20 pounds in the first six months. Fast forward through the next seventeen years and I was obese. I was one hundred pounds over weight and pre diabetic. I had abnormally high white blood cell count, plantar fasciitis, and heals spurs. My white blood cell count was so high and abnormal that they thought I might have leukemia. Upon lots of testing and emotionally fears, I found out that my white blood cell count had been high going back as much as 15 years. I could hardly walk because of the pain in my feet. I also had a nursing rash that I got immediately upon the birth of my fourth child. It lasted for two years. I could not get rid of it.After two years I went to a dermatologist who said it was staff infection and I would need to take an antibiotic for two months. I had tried every diet. I had lost fifty pounds here and there and then gained it back. It was a cycle.I felt hopelessly addicted to food. I felt trapped in the cycle. I was always worried about the longevity of my life for the sake of my children as well as my own.Then in September of 2013 my dad was diagnosed with cancer. My dad developed diabetes at age 36, but he seemed to totally manage that disease. However, when he got cancer I was immediately faced with my fears. My dad is in construction, which requires a lot of physical activity and he has never been as overweight as me. So as I looked at him I saw myself but worse. It was like the hand of God empowered me to change in that very moment. And that is exactly what happened to me. My life changed.I started learning about food. I had several friends who were on this journey as well. One friend, Hillary, helped me so much. It was very important part of this journey to have encouragement and accountability. Then one day my mom, Debbie, told me about FoodBabe. I was so excited and amazed by the information that she was giving. She was making such an impact in the world. She was making a difference.I signed up for her monthly menus. I was so excited to have the meal plans and the shopping lists. She is very creative. One of the things that I like most about FoodBabe is that she is very realistic and neutral. In this journey it has been hard to find the heathly road. There are so many healthy plans . Yet FoodBabe is very practical and teaches you how to have spice in life without the chemicals. The food is tasty and enjoyable. It is beautiful to the eyes as well as tasting great.I have really enjoyed many of her videos of how to make things, like coconut milk. I used to buy the So Delicious thinking that was the best choice. But once again FoodBabe showed me how easily I can make my own. I have read her book as well. And it is awesome. It is captivating and encouraging. FoodBabe is spunky and stunning. She is bold and courageous. She is educated and full of wisdom. Her guidance in this journey as been invaluable. She has an amazing ability to reach in to peoples lives and change them. She is reaching into the culture and changing it. She is reaching into the world of big food and changing it. She is arming we the people to make true change in health. She is changing generations to come. She is exposing the truth. She is beyond amazing in this journey of truth. I would encourage anyone to read her articles and get her menu plans.As for me, I have lost sixty six pounds to date. I no longer have plantar fasciitis or heal spurs. My white blood cell count is completely normal. My nursing rash went away in the first twenty one days of eating an anti inflammatory diet with no antibiotics. I feel great.I am not at my goal weight yet but I will get there. This is not a sprint. I have learned how to travel and live life all while choosing to eat healthy. My whole family is eating this way. I have peace now knowing that my children will be empowered and educated about food and what is actually in the food. My life is forever changed. Praise the Lord for true and lasting change. September will mark two years of this journey for me. I am still going strong and for the first time have no regrets!Let me encourage each of you to take this amazing journey. You will never look back in defeat again. It is beyond worth it. Thank you FoodBabe for all that you do. I will forever be touched by your passion. Your passion is igniting a wild fire that is burning through the world making an impact on everyone!!

Subway: We Want Subs Not Drugs! (Share This With Everyone You Know),http://foodbabe.com/subwaymeatshare/,
"5 Foods I Used To Eat At The Office That Made Me Sick, Tired and Overweight.",http://foodbabe.com/2015/04/08/5-foods-used-eat-office-made-sick-tired-overweight/,"When I used to work in a busy office, I was exposed to a variety of foods on a daily basis that weresabotaging my health, weight and looks. Because I wanted to fit in and focus on work, I ate whatever everyone else around me was eating, and boy was that a mistake. Thankfully, I broke free from this mentality, started thinking for myself and taking back control of my food and health. Not only did I lose weight when I did this, my entire body changed.One of the first commitments I made was to start taking my lunch to work. Not only was it less expensive to do this, my health soared as a result.It all comes down to being prepared. Only youcan control what you eat on a daily basis, and it doesnt need to be complicated or expensive. I compiled alist here of 20 of my favorite foods to dineand munch on at the office. But first, Im going to warn you about some of the most common office foods that you should stay far, far away from  as they are no good for your health. These are the foods I would eat because they were there. Sitting there in the office break room or on a co-workers desk calling my name! Eventually giving up additive-filled food helped me finally say no thanks.Dont let your office be a breeding ground for food industry toxins! Getthese foods out of your office for good:1. Microwave PopcornWhen it comes to microwave popcorn, everything from the bag, the oil, and the corn, is bad news! Dont believe for a second that the delicious popcorn smell wafting into your office is a good thing! Food companies might not want to publicize all the details about artificial flavors, but some emit possibly toxic fumes. Artificial flavors are a secret concoction of ingredients that are not required to be disclosed, so you dont know whats really in them. The flavoring ingredient diacetyl, which some major manufacturers eliminatedfrom their artificial flavors, has been linked tolung diseaseamong employees at popcorn and flavoring production facilities. We dont know what these manufacturers have substituted diacetyl with and theres the possibility that some brands still use it because it hasnt been banned. A possible substitute for diacetyl is 2,3-pentanedione, which is linked tolung damage in animal studies. The bottom line is, you dont know what you are ingesting when it comes to artificial flavors  so its a good idea to avoid them.Some brands (like Jolly Time Healthy Pop and Pop Secret) still use partially hydrogenated soybean oil, a major source of artificial trans fat which is associated with up to 20,000 heart attacks and 7,000 deaths per year according to the CDC. To top it all off  some popcorn bags may be lined with perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA), a chemical linked to cancer, and the popcorn itself may contain harmful pesticide residues.2. DonutsNo one thinks donuts are healthy, but this treat is super popular at meetings and I used to get excited when someoneplopped a box of these on the table. That was until I found out that commercially made donuts contain a lot more than just carbs and fat  theyre loaded with harmful additives too. A single frosted strawberry donut from Dunkin Donuts is slathered withhigh fructose corn syrup and partially hydrogenated oils  an ingredient the FDA is considering toban and contains a slew of preservatives, emulsifiers, fake flavors and artificial color. Some commercially bought donuts even contain butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), a preservative linked to cancer. Its not worth riskingyour health with these ingredients.3. SodaMost sodas contain high fructose corn syrup, natural flavors, and caramel coloring. When it comes to diet (low-calorie) soda, youre still not doing your body any favors.A calorie isnt a calorie when its made up of additives that affect how much you eat and the way your body metabolizes those chemicals. Low calorie beverages will not fight obesity,and if anything, the reliance on chemical-filled drinks just perpetuates the problem. Despite what you might have heard, artificial sweeteners have been shown to stimulate your appetite, increase sugar cravings, and thereby promote fat storage and weight gain. Recent research links it to nearlytripling abdominal fat!4. Supermarket Birthday CakesHow many times have you celebrated a co-workers birthday with a supermarket cake? The ingredient list on most store-bought cakes is so long I literally have trouble keeping count  but Ive seen close to 80 ingredients! The majority of them are fake chemical fillers and food-like substances that are obviously not real food, and its nearly impossible to find one without artificial colors and partially hydrogenated oils. Most cake manufacturers use no real cane sugar at all and the whole cake is sweetened with genetically modified sugar beets (which will just say sugar in the ingredients) or high fructose corn syrup. Some cakes also contain paraben ingredients, like propyl paraben, which is believed to be an endocrine disruptor linked to cancer.5. Frozen Processed LunchesI am so guilty of this. I used to think calorie-controlled frozen meals were actually a good way to stay slim. I was wrong. Just because theyre quick and low-calorie doesnt mean you should eat it. Ive never been in an office where someone doesnt pop a Lean Cuisine or Healthy Choice entreein the microwave for lunch. Unfortunately, the vast majority of these meals contain a shocking number of harmful additives. A singleWeight Watchers Smart Ones Salisbury Steak meal containssodium phosphate, partially hydrogenated oil, caramel coloring and lots of hidden MSG. None of the ingredients are organic or non-GMO verified and its full of sugar and corn-derived ingredients.Stockup with these Top 20 Office Eats instead:1. Veggie sticks: This seems so obvious and simplebecause it is! Even when working at home, this is my daily go-to snack. Its easy tomake some matchsticks of carrots, celery, bell peppers, cucumbers or whatever raw veggies are your favorite. Pick veggies that are local, seasonal and organic.2. Hummus:This goes great with those raw veggie sticks, or you canalso use this as a dip for crackers. I recommend making your own, as most store-bought versions contain preservatives and soybean or canola oil. Plus  its super easy to make! (Hummus Recipe & Beet Hummus Recipe).3. Homemade Superfood Popcorn: I make this easyand deliciouspopcorn with 3 amazing ingredients: coconut oil, hemp seeds, red palm oil. All popcorn is non-GMO, but choose organic to minimize exposure to pesticides. Get the recipe here and put it in a reusable bag like this to bring to the office. Also you can buy some ready-made store bought organic popcorn like the one from Trader Joes that is made with olive oil.4. Trail mix: Mix up your own with personal favorites like raw almonds, brazil nuts, cashews, walnuts, sunflower seeds, pumpkin seeds, coconut flakes, and dried fruit. Walnuts in particular have been shown to enhancecritical thinking skills which is essential to performingyour best in the office. If you buy each of the ingredients separately inbulk bins at the grocery store (instead of pre-mixed packaged versions) you can save some serious cash.5. Fresh fruit: This is natures convenience food. Bring along grapes, bananas, apples, peaches, pears, berries, ect. Stick with seasonal, local and organic. I also love to snack on cherry tomatoes at my desk because they are convenient and not messy.6. Oatmeal: Make your own little packets of oatmeal with rolled oats, quick oats, cinnamon, and chia seeds. This is how I make oatmeal when Im not at home.7. Dates:These are full of fiber and nutrients, but they are super sweet like natures candy! Just one of these will satisfy your sweet tooth, and theyre super delicious stuffed with a walnut or almond butter. I also use dates to sweeten my oatmeal (dice it upand add it to the water before cooking the oats).8. Parfait Porridge: Thistastes like a berry parfait, minus the yogurt. The best part of this breakfast is the raw oat groats as theycontain more vitamins, minerals and nutrients than processed steel cut, rolled or instant oats. They are available in most health food stores inexpensively in the bulk section. Itonly takes a few minutes to put together the night before work and youll be super happy to have one in the morning for breakfast (I promise). I like tomake enough to last about 3 days and keep them in the fridge for busy mornings. Get the recipe here.9.Almond butter: This is great with apples,bananas, crackers, or stuffed into a date. You can buy individual packets here, if you dont want to keep an entire jar at the office.10:Green tea and herbal teas: Im always carrying around tea with me, wherever I go, because I drink it every day. Stick with organic teas that dont contain artificial and natural flavors and unnecessary additives (my favorite brand is Numi). I used this Breville kettle regularly when I worked outside of the home in an office to heat up water for my tea. Yes, I kept my kettle plugged in at my cubicle! (My cube mates loved using it too!) When you add up the cost of unhealthy andexpensive alternatives (sodas and lattes), the cost of a good tea kettle is a no brainer and it pays for itself pretty quickly. This kettle can also heat up water for cooking oatmeal.11. Kombucha:This naturally fermented drink made from tea is slightly sweet, tangy and refreshing. It also helps populate your gut with good bacteria, which can improve your digestion, strengthen your immune system, and may help you stay lean. You can also make your own kombucha soda at home on the cheap.12. Homemade Ginger Ale (or Seltzer Water with Fruit Slices):Theres no reason to ever hit up the soda machine in the break room anymore. If you crave the fizz, try packing some of my Homemade REAL Ginger Ale(recipe here), or simply marinateslices oflemons, limes, oranges (or other fruits) in some seltzer water for a refreshing drink.13. Salads: Its super easy to pack salads in a glass container, just keep the dressing on the side (or at the bottom of the container) to keep the greensfrom wilting. You can keep a few in ready-to-go containers in the fridge. Add in some beans, lentils, hemp seeds and quinoa for extra protein and try myMelt in Your Mouth Kale Salad,Quinoa Tabbouleh Salad, orCarrot Blueberry Sprout Salad recipes.One of my all-time fave salad dressing recipes is this Tahini Dressing (it will make a salad lover out of anyone).14. Sandwich Wraps:You dont even need a recipe necessarily, as I often just spread some hummus on a sprouted grain tortilla and wrap up some greens, chickpeas or lentils, bell peppers, shredded carrots, and whatever fresh veggies are in my fridge. Adding some pickles or kimchi adds some spicy saltiness. Recipes to try: Chickpea Curry Wrap and Chicken (or chickpea) Salad Sandwich.15. Homemade Cookies: Yes  I said cookies! These are great for those times when you want to treat your office mates with something sweet and avoid the dreaded donuts and supermarket birthday cakes. The best part about making them yourself is that you can reduce the amount of sugar and control exactly what you put into them. Try baking some homemadeLow Sugar Cookies or Forever Cookies.15. Golden Berries:These are natures little Sour Patch Kid, arent loaded with sugar and have 5 grams of fiber per ounce. You can buy them in most grocery stores and online here.16. Plain Yogurt:Before you leave for work toss in some fresh or frozen berries, banana slices, and if you like it a bit sweeter mix in someraw honey or maple syrup. Other great stir-ins are granola, chopped nuts or chia seeds. Just pack those separately and add them to the yogurt when youre ready to eat. Always choose plain organic yogurt  heres why. Its also super easy to make your own yogurt, check out my moms recipehere.17. Brads Raw Chips:For those times when you really want a crunchy chip, this is one of the best good for you chips on the market. Brads Raw Chips are made from raw and all whole foods  no gluten, sugar or added chemicals.18. Avocados:You can pop one open, and keep some salt and cayenne at your desk for sprinkling.19. Marys Gone Crackers or Pretzels: Stack these with avocado slices, bananas, almond butter or hummus  theyre very versatile and crunchy. Also great served alongside a salad for lunch.20.Green Smoothie: Theres a reason that this smoothie made the news  its both healthy and delicious!To make it quickly in the morning, wash and cut all of the veggies and fruit that you will be using the night before and store it in the fridge. That way in the morning you just pop it in the blender and pour it into a glass jar (like this one) to bring to work. You can even make smoothies the night before too and have them ready to grab and go. If you want added protein, blendin some hemp protein powder, hemp seeds, chia seeds or nut butters. Check out my favorite blenders here.No matter how busy you are, its possible to make a healthy lunchtime part of your daily routine.I hear from somany of you that youlack the time in the morning to pack a healthy lunch for work, and dont know where to start to make it simple enough to fit into your busy schedule. You find yourself hungry at lunchtime, with vending machines and fast food restaurants at every corner waiting to sabotage your goals. Thats why I created the Food Babe Eating Guide for you  check it out here.Do you know a co-worker or friend that could use this info?

Response: NY Times Lets Biased Freelancer Attack Food Babe – Vani Hari,http://foodbabe.com/2015/03/15/response-to-ny-times/,"This is a response to the NY Times article:Taking On the Food Industry, One Blog Post at a Time by Courtney Rubin, Published March 13, 2015I am very sad to have to post this rebuttal to the New York Times story about our movement. The Times is among the most respected newspapers in the world, but it violated its own standards of accuracy and fairness in Courtney Rubins story about me last week.This story is a classic one-sided hatchet job.You know the work we do is important to the health of millions. Weve demanded transparency, helped remove questionable chemicals from the food supply along with other respected groups, changed major multi-billion dollar food companies and educated many people.This unfortunately is not the focus of the story.The reporter featured only the views of certain academics who attack us  every single one of whom has a conflict of interest due to their associations with the food or chemical industries (and this is not disclosed). Although I gave Ms. Rubin the names of scientific, medical and consumer experts who support our work, these did not appear in the story, with one exception (Ken Cook of the Environmental Working Group) and even his quote was chosen to support her obvious bias.The Center for Science in the Public Interest, the Natural Resources Defense Council, Consumers Union, the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, The National Academy of Sciences, The Center for Food Safety, and many respected medical and scientific authorities support reducing the synthetic chemicals used in our food. Authorities in the UK, the EU and Australia have banned many of the ingredients we have campaigned against, based on the scientific evidence. None of these were quoted or mentioned.Lets examine who wasDr. Joseph Schwarczis the Director of McGill Universitys Office for Science & Society, which has in the past received funding from the biotech (GMO) industry Dow, Monsanto, and Dupont through the Council for Biotechnology Information (1). Dr. Schwarcz is also on the Editorial Board for the magazine of the Chemical Institute of Canada, ACCN. Based on his advocacy,one could say Dr. Schwarcz hasnt met a chemical he doesnt like.Furthermore, he has made sexist remarks about me including one that was quoted by Bloomberg Businessweek: She gets on all these talk shows partly because she is easier to look at.Hes been highly and personally disrespectful to me (2) more than once in public comments. He saidIm addicted to the Food Babe, called methe stupid woman, I havezero knowledge, that hes concerned aboutthe location of my brain, andI aman American Hoax artist.He cyberbullies by asking his students to post repeated questions about my credentials over and over again on my Facebook wall, although they already know the answer. I sent this information to Ms. Rubin, but again she failed to mention it  instead glorifying his comments like a thoughtful critic.Ms. Rubin quotesKevin Folta, chair of the Horticultural Sciences Department at the University of Florida. He does not specialize in health or nutrition; rather he is a crop scientist specializing in GMOs who seeks industry funding and support for this research (3). He has repeatedly stated in the media he wishes to improve the public perception of GMO technology.Dr. Folta writes for GMOAnswers (4) a website thatsfunded by the biotechnology industry.Theres an obvious conflict of interest here  he is a pro-GMO activist and as you have read through my investigations, I have doubts about the technology and its role in the proliferation of chemicalsthat are impacting human health. I, along with the majority of Americans believe we should have the right to know whether we are consuming GMOs  he does not. UPDATE: Although Foltahas claimed publicly he has no relationship with Monsanto multiple times,it was found during a FOIA request that he received 25k from Monsanto. Evidence & detailshere,hereandhere. FOIA request also revealed emails that show evidence of coordinated messagingbetween executives at Monsanto and Monsantos PR Firm Ketchum.Professor Dr. Fergus Clydesdaleof the University of Massachusetts is on the Board of Sensient Technologies (5), aglobal manufacturer of colors, flavors and fragrances which means they make synthetic food additives. As you know, many experts find these artificial ingredients in food questionable and sometimes misleading  so of course he would oppose our work. He also served on the food industry front group International Food Information Council (5a). His argument that synthetic chemicals in the food supply are the equivalent of naturally occurring ingredients is not only disproven, but laughable. By his, and apparently this reporters logic, there should be no regulatory action taken against the proven carcinogens, obesegens, teratogens that cause birth defects, and synthetic estrogens or chemicals that have invaded our food supply and our bodies.The piece mentionsDr. David Gorski, who also has received pharmaceutical industry funding (6). He likes to vilify quackery, and has even attacked the venerable Cleveland Clinic for using some alternative medicine (7). He is simply wrong that there is no propylene glycol, the antifreeze kind, in some beers and alcohol. We know Fireball Whiskey contains it (8) and its listed as an approved ingredient in alcohol on the government website ttb.gov (9). This is easy to prove if you arent looking to discredit someone. I answered this previously in a response to my critics back in December2014 (10), but this was ignored and has been re-hashed time and time again.I truly thought when I agreed to be interviewed by Ms. Rubin, I was meeting with a fair and unbiased journalist. Based on the last 48 hours of repeated tweets by her and others (11) I see where her true colors lie. For example, she chose to favorite a tweet that called me Fraud Babe and that claimed my activism is purely an opaque money making operation. She retweeted a spokesperson from a hate Facebook group. Ms. Rubin also repeatedly tweeted accusationsat me. This is what harassment looks like, and is very unprofessional for a freelancer for the venerable New York Times. See screenshots below.Regardless of her agenda, Ms. Rubin has a history of being misled before (12) and looks like she is being duped again by an organizedfood industry campaign against us.Ms. Rubinsstory had many errors and omissions. Here are some of the biggest ones:The dough conditioner azodicarbonamide is banned in food in the EU, Australia and Singapore. FDA allows its use, as they do many chemicals banned abroad, relying solely on industry representations without independent testing, and often without testing of any kind. Both the EWG (13) and The Center For Science In The Public Interest (CSPI ) (14) supported my Subway petition to remove it from their bread and agree the FDA should remove it from the Generally Regarded As Safe or GRAS status. FDA approval sadly does not mean proven safe  this is well known and legislation has been proposed to address it. (15)I never said that microwave ovens are causing cancer. I said using them could create carcinogenic compounds. Many expertsadvise against microwaving food in plastic, for example, for just this reason. (16a, 16b)The beer investigation and petition was all about transparency. My objection to fish bladders in beer stems from the view that ingredients should be labeled, so that vegetarians can avoid them if they choose. I never said the ingredient is harmful. I responded to this argument in my beer investigations (17)  but this keeps getting rehashed as part of an intentional industry campaign to paint me as a fearmonger.Ken Cooks statements about me were taken out of context. Ken is an advisor of mine, and several of the ingredients weve campaigned against appear on his respected Environmental Working Groups list of the dirty dozen chemicals to avoid in the food supply. Of course this wasnt mentioned.I (just like the NY Times and most other bloggers & websites) remove comments on my website and on social media pages from people making blatantly sexist, objectionable remarks, using fake profiles, and those that conduct astroturf, organized campaigns to harass over and over again. No apologies for that. I also provided Ms. Rubin with a 2-paragraph explanation (via email with screen shots of examples) of our social media moderating methodology, and this was not mentioned.We want to interact with people who truly want to have a better food system  promoting healthy ingredients on a daily basis and create a positive environment. A healthy debate is fine, but someone can make their point without stepping over the line and becoming abusive.Ms. Rubin wrote that the dose makes the poison, which is not always true. In the case of endocrine-disrupting chemicals, for example, studies show that it is precisely the lowest doses that cause an effect (mimicking hormone levels in the body) while higher doses have none. This statement also ignores the very real  and unregulated  problem of the additive and synergistic effects of the cumulative soup of chemicals we are being exposed to everyday. (18)Since this reporter failed to do balanced reporting, I want to share this research by my friend and colleague Max Goldberg who documented the scientists and experts who do agree with our work. Its a must read.This story is just way outside the normal standards of a normally truly great newspaper. However, it wont daunt or stop us from pushing to clean up the food supply to improve the health of this country.Onward!VaniSources:1.http://web.archive.org/web/20070627055333/http://oss.mcgill.ca/ 2.

The Shocking Difference Between Organic & Non-GMO Labels – It’s Huge!,http://foodbabe.com/2015/02/26/difference-between-organic-non-gmo-labels/,"One of the things I love to do every year is visit The Natural Products Expo, I go to both shows every year (west coast and east coast) to see the types of natural products food companies are creating and meet the founders behind them. Every year I see more and more Non-GMO products being created which is a great sign of the times, but theres something really tricky and important you need to know about these products.Theres a lot of confusion and debate about what non-GMO and organic labels really mean.The labels are very different! Its crucial to understand the difference if you want to pick out the healthiest and safest food for you and your family. Every time we decide to buy a product, we are supporting so much more than our bodies. We are shaping the landscape of the entire food system  everything from the environment, land, air, water to the farmers themselves. And this is why I want you to know the truth about the Non-GMO label and what it really means.What exactly does the Non-GMO Project label mean?The Non-GMO Project label only verifies that aproductdoesnt contain genetically modified (GMO) ingredients (or technically less than 0.9% GMOs). While that is good, its not the whole story about what the product contains, how it was produced, and where it came from.But when I have a choice, I always choose organic food because of these reasons10 reasons whyOrganic beats Non-GMO every time:1. Certified organic foods are also non-GMO.USDA organic regulations prohibitany genetically modified (GMO) ingredients in a certified organic product. I avoid GMOs at all costs, and going organic is one of the easiest ways to do it. NOTE: The USDA Organic labelcertifies that 95%-100% of the ingredients are organic, so there is a slight chance that (up to 5%) of non-organic ingredients are in the producthowever they are not supposed tobe GMO. There are still some tricky loopholes, so thats why you need to look for 100% certified organic or a Non-GMO Project verified label to ensure its GMO-free.2. Organic crops cannot be grown with synthetic pesticides, and contain much lower pesticide residues overall.Organic regulations prohibit certain toxic pesticides from being used on crops, but there are no special restrictions for non-GMO crops. So, non-GMO crops can be grown the same as other conventional crops andcanstill be laden with toxic pesticide residues, including organophosphatesthat are linked tolymphoma and leukemia. A bag of non-GMO potato chips can contain residues from up to 35 different pesticides used on conventional potatoes, several of which are known carcinogens, suspected hormonedisruptors, neurotoxins, orreproductive toxins. Also non-GMO produce (like strawberries and celery) are on the EWGs Dirty Dozen Guide as the most contaminated with pesticides.While natural pesticides are allowed on organic crops, its been shown that organic produce hasvery low levels of pesticide residue compared with conventional crops, and by eating organic you can significantlydecrease your exposure to pesticide residues (source).3. The most widely-used herbicide on the planet  Glyphosate (Roundup)  is prohibited on organic crops. Non-GMO crops such as wheat can be pre-harvested with glyphosate. This herbicide is a toxin that can accumulate in your body the more you are exposed to it. It has been linked to kidney disease, breast cancer, and some birth defects. According to Dr. Stephanie Seneff, a senior research scientist at MIT, glyphosate is largely responsible for the escalating incidence of autoimmune and other neurological disorders that we are experiencing. There are many non-GMO products on the market that contain wheat and seem healthy  but they could be laced with glyphosate. For instance, whole-wheat breads and non-GMO cereals that arent organic (like Grape Nuts)may contain glyphosate residues.4. Organic ingredients arent processed with toxic hexane. Most conventional oils (canola, soybean, corn) are extracted with the neurotoxin hexane, and some residue has been shown to remain in these oils. Hexane is also used in the processing of many soy ingredients like soy protein and textured vegetable protein, and testing done by The Cornucopia Institute has found residues insome ofthese ingredients. Almost all research focuses on the industrial use and inhalation ofhexane:No epidemiology or case report studies examining health effects in humans or chronic laboratory studies evaluating potential health effects in animals following oral exposure to n-hexane are available. Why isnt anyone studying how safe it is to have this neurotoxin in our food? Industrial exposure has beenlinkedto brain tumors and nerve damage. The FDA does not set a maximum residue level for hexane, and no one knows for sure how much residue is being consumed by the American public.Theresnothing prohibiting these ingredientsin non-GMO products, but hexane-processed ingredientsarebanned from products with the USDA Organic seal.5. Organic crops are prohibited from beingfertilized with sewage sludge. Conventional non-GMO crops can be treated with biosolids, which is literally the treated waste thats flushed down the toilet, and waste from hospitals and industry. This waste can be contaminated with such things as heavy metals, endocrine disruptors, pathogens, pharmaceuticals, pesticides, and dioxins  its basically a toxic chemical soup! Its been shown that some of these contaminants are absorbed into (or remain as residue on) the crops that we eat. These residueshaveproven deadly to cattle that have grazed on crops fertilized with biosolids, and it certainly isnt something we should be eating.6. Organicmeat isnt produced withgrowth-promoting drugs, like ractopamine. Packagednon-GMO foods maycontain meatthat has been raised on growth-promoting steroids and drugs.Residues of some of these drugs have been found in meat and its been shown that eating products with traces of ractopaminecan lead to an unacceptable level of risk of diseases of the cardiovascular system.7. Organic animals arentfattened up with growth-promoting antibiotics.The overuse of growth-promoting antibiotics is creating superbugs that could threaten the entire human population. Antibiotics have been used for years, not just to fight infection, but to fatten up farm animals. This use is polluting our environment, water and food supply. Studies show that antibiotics have the same consequences for us, and can fatten us up too. This is because antibiotics kill off healthy bacteria in the gut  beneficial bugs called probiotics that influence how we absorb nutrients, burn off calories, and stay lean. Scientists have found that lean people have more of the good, anti-obesity bacteria in their guts, compared to people who are overweight. Growth-promoting antibioticsare only being used to increase industry profits andthe bestway to stop these practices is to refuse to buy products made with them.8. The non-GMO label claim is unregulated.Essentially anyone can say that their product is non-GMO, because the FDA has not set any standards to regulate the use of this claim on a label. This is not to be confused with theNon-GMO Project label, as they have a processfor verifying whether products are non-GMO, andI feel that their label can be trusted(just as Whole Foods will only label products as non-GMO if they carry the Non-GMO Project verification label or are certified organic). However, some food manufacturers have been caught red-handedwith unverified claims on their packages that say they are non-GMO when they really arent. As no independent 3rd party testing is required to verify their claims, there is some corruption going on. For instance, when Consumer Reports tested Xochitl tortilla chips with a non-GMO claim on the bag, they found GMO corn in them. Since most of these non-verified products have not been 3rd party tested and there are no government regulations, its not a reliable label claim.Theres another big reason to eat organic It can help you stay thin!9.Organic foods prohibit many of the chemicals known as obesogens that trigger our bodies to store fat.Antibiotics, growth hormones, pesticides, and synthetic preservatives are just a few of the chemicals that researchers have defined asobesogens. The theory that obesogens in our food and environment could be making us fat has been gathering steam ever since researcher Paula Baillie-Hamilton published an article in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine in 2002, presenting strong evidence that chemical exposure caused weight gain in experimental animals. As reported in the New York Times piece, Warnings From A Flabby Mouse, exposure to endocrine disrupting chemicals can cause weight gain. This is important because many of the synthetic pesticides that can be found on non-GMO conventional crops are endocrine disruptors. Also  the sewage sludge fertilizing some of these crops has been shown to contain endocrine disruptors. Minimizing your exposure to obesogensby choosing an organic dietmay be the boost you need to lose weight and keep it off.Source: NY TimesThe only difference between these mice: The one at the top was exposed at birth to a tiny amount of an endocrine-disrupting chemical  these chemicals can be found in synthetic pesticides sprayed on non-GMO and conventional crops.10. By choosing organic food youll automatically avoid most of the Sickening 15 ingredients that I talk about in my new book, The Food Babe Way. Chemicalslike synthetic preservatives, synthetic pesticides, growth hormones and antibiotics are not used in organic food. These are the chemicals that can make you tired, wreck havoc on your skin, make you feel fat and miserable, even though youve been dieting and exercising like crazy. Even worse  they may put you at risk for scary, life-shortening diseases like cancer.Im not saying thatall organic products are perfect. Some of them contain suspect chemicals too.While its best to choose organic unprocessed food whenever you have the opportunity, its still very important to read ingredient lists on organic packaged products.Some organic and non-GMO products contain unnecessary additives and non-organic additives that can be detrimental to your health and waistline. Look for (and avoid)these ingredients in organic and non-GMO foods:Hidden MSG  Although monosodium glutamate is prohibited in organic food, they can useother forms of free glutamic acidsuch as Yeast Extract, Hydrolyzed Soy Protein, Autolyzed Yeast Extract, Textured Protein. These chemicals are excitotoxins and can greatly influence how much you eat. For a full list of these hidden MSG additives, check out my new book  The Food Babe Way.Carrageenan  Its alarming that this ispermitted in organic food. According to research conducted byThe CornucopiaInstitute, animal studies showthat food-grade carrageenan causes gastrointestinal inflammation and higher rates of intestinal lesions, ulcerations, and even malignant tumors. Food grade undegraded carrageenan iscontaminatedwith degraded carrageenan (the kind thats not considered food grade). The World Health Organizations International Agency for Research on Cancer and the National Research Council of the United Stateshave both determinedthat degraded carrageenan is a carcinogen.Unhealthy Oils  Non-GMOcanola oil isused in some products, but canola oil consumption islinkedtovitamin E deficiencyand ashortened life spanin animal studies. Likewise, I often see sunflower and safflower oils on the label, which arevery high in omega-6 fatty acids, and not the healthiest oil to use.Natural Flavors  These are not so natural, as they are created in a lab,may contain addicting chemicalsand up to 100 secret ingredients.If you know someone who needs to know this truth  please share this post with them! Its so important that we keep spreading the word about what these labels really mean. The more we know, the better we all are!Xo,Vani255K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

Gingerbread Cupcakes With Coconut Icing,http://foodbabe.com/2013/12/03/gingerbread-cupcakes-with-coconut-icing/,"I made these gingerbread cupcakes for a family get together last weekend and they were an absolute hit! I love gingerbread, especially given the season  all that yummy smelling ginger, cinnamon, and cloves baking in the oven, so good! What makes these cupcakes unique however, is the icing! I love making healthier icing because it is usually the worst part of any cupcake recipe. This one uses a unique blend of coconut manna or coconut butter, a little maple syrup, vanilla and coconut flakes for a festive look.Coconut manna is basically dried coconut meat that is blended until really smooth like butter (just like almonds are ground and blended into almond butter). Coconut manna can replace many dairy ingredients like milk, cream cheese and butter.For the cake part, I love using a mix of almond flour and coconut flour or entirely spelt flour. Ive made them both ways and they turn out fantastic every time. Coconut flour is much drier and absorbent than the average flour so if youre substituting it, youll need to make some adjustments  for every 1/2 cup of coconut flour, you will want to add more liquid to your recipes. An extra egg does the trick!And its no secret Im a huge fan of coconut oil andcoconut sugar to replace any refined oil or white sugar in recipes. Coconut sugar has more vitamins and minerals than any other type of sugar, its completely unrefined and considered a low glycemic sugar that has a smaller effect on blood sugar. And thankfully Nutiva (who I buy all my coconut products from because they support GMO labeling and my investigations) sources their coconut sugar sustainably without hurting the environment or animals.    4.9 from 14 reviews   Gingerbread Cupcakes With Coconut Icing     Print     Prep time  5 mins    Cook time  25 mins    Total time  30 mins      Serves: 12-24   Ingredients   cup coconut oil  cup coconut sugar  cup molasses 1 egg (or flax egg (combine 1 tbsp ground flaxseed with 3 tbsp water)) 1 and  cup spelt flour (gluten free option: 1 cup almond flour +  cup coconut flour + 1 more egg)  tablespoon ground ginger 1 teaspoon cinnamon  teaspoon salt  teaspoon ground cloves  cup boiling water  tablespoon baking soda     Instructions  Preheat oven to 350 and line muffin tins with baking cups In a bowl, combine coconut oil, coconut sugar, and molasses and egg and mix well In a medium bowl whisk flour, ginger, cinnamon, salt, and cloves.

Don’t Fall Victim To These Tricky Juice Labels,http://foodbabe.com/2013/11/10/juice-labels/,"Theres nothing like making fresh raw vegetable or fruit juice at home with your own juicer. But lets be honest, it takes time, energy and a commitment to keep up the routine at home. The availability and the variety of store-bought juice concoctions have absolutely exploded on the market and tempt us with convenience, fancy marketings and a bunch of healthy buzz words. Heres the scoop on how tricky understanding juice labels can be at the grocery store and how to choose the best store bought juices for you and your family.100% Juice Doesnt Mean AnythingWhat does 100% juice really mean? Not much. Food companies are allowed to say 100% juice on the label even though their juice contains additional additives, flavorings or preservatives. In the case of V8, they add sodium (salt), flavoring, vitamin C and citric acid to preserve the juice for a longer shelf life. All of these added ingredients do nothing for your body and in some cases could harm you. This isnt exactly a healthy dose of juice after considering the flavoring on the label could bemade from petroleum that is often contaminated with carcinogens. Also, flavoring could have hidden MSG in it  which increases cravings and addiction (so food companies profit more). Companies that use flavoring wont tell you exactly whats in it either, theyll say their formula is proprietary and keep you guessing.Concentrate Is Just A Fancy Name for SyrupAnother way juice companies sabotage you, is by using shelf-stable juice concentrates instead of real juice. Juice concentrates are made from fruits and vegetables that are heated down to syrup and then have water added back in. The concentration process involves both adding in and subtracting chemicals and natural plant by-products in order to condense the juice. During the concentration process, fruits and vegetables lose flavor and this is one of the reasons why companies have to re-add flavoring to make the juice taste fresh.The concentration allows juice companies to keep their juice shelf stable, preserved longer and allows them to save money during fruit processing. In other words, juice companies sell you an inferior product while making more money.Not From Concentrate Could Be FlavoredWhat if the label explicitly states not from concentrate. Does that mean that the product has no added flavors? No. Actually, thats a big fat no! When most commercially available orange juices are made, according to the book Squeezed: What You Dont Know About Orange Juice,the juice is stored in giant tanks and the oxygen is removed from them, which allows the liquid to keep for up to a year without spoiling. This storage makes the orange juice lose mega flavor. So the industry uses flavor packs to re-flavor the juice. Even if your juice says 100% juice or premium on the ingredient label, it can still have these flavor packs, because they are not required to be listed on the ingredient label because technically they are derived from orange essence or oil. Sneaky, huh?Ever wonder why store-bought juice can achieve that consistent trademarkedtaste, bottle after bottle? Now you know! (Please note: Uncle Matts is a brand that is 100% juice, not from concentrate that specifically does not use flavor packs.)GMOsMany juice companies use an ingredient called citric acid to extend the shelf life of their product. Most people would think this citric acid comes from, well, citrus like lemons, oranges and limes, but it doesnt. The ingredients most food manufacturers use to create citric acid aregenetically engineered corn and sugar beets, by synthetically fermenting the glucose from these crops in a laboratory.Also, some juice companies go as far as adding sugar (that could be from GMO sugar beets), high fructose corn syrup (from GMO corn) and/or other ingredients that could contain GMOs. Tropicana, Ocean Spray and Minute Maid are huge offenders of this  so its no surprise they were some of the companies who gave millions of dollars recently in Washington to stop GMO labeling. They dont want you to know their juices are full of GMOs.Remember GMOs have never been tested long term on humans, and are linked to the rise in allergies, infertility and auto-immune disorders, not to mention they have increased the use of toxic pesticides in the environment by 500 million pounds.It is absolutely critical we get GMO labeling in this country. We deserve the right to know what we are eating and the companies fighting against this basic fundamental right do not deserve our money.Synthetic IngredientsThe sneakiest of ingredients that can show up in juice are in the form of synthetic ingredients that seem natural but are actually man-made and created in a laboratory.Naked Juice (owned by Pepsi Co) was recently sued because they claimed their juices were 100% All Natural but really contain these synthetic ingredients:Fibersol-2  a proprietary synthetic digestion-resistant fiber produced by Archer Daniels Midland and developed by a Japanese chemical company.Fructooligosaccharides  a synthetic fiber and sweetener.Inulin  an artificial and invisible fiber added to foods to artificially increase fiber content.This example is just one of the reasons why its incredibly important to look at the ingredient list rather than the marketing lingo on the front of the label. (FYI  The Wall Street Journal just reported, Pepsi plans to drop the All Natural label on Naked Juice)Also, make sure to watch out for other harmful ingredients like artificial food coloring. I was shocked to see that so many innocent looking juice brands use petroleum based dyes to color their juices, like Ocean Sprays Red Ruby Grapefruit Juice.PasteurizationHeres the real killer, no pun intended. Most juice companies use traditional pasteurization or flash pasteurization to destroy harmful bacteria, viruses, molds, and other microorganisms to safeguard our health by heating the juice (this would be the second time your juice is heated if you are drinking juice from concentrate). But during this process, pasteurization also kills raw enzymes, minerals and vitamins  the reason that we are drinking the juice in the first place. Heat kills the bad stuff and good stuff, making the juice pretty much worthless to consume.Juice companies sometimes even replenish the lost vitamin content with synthetic vitamins because there is barely any nutrition left after processing. In the book Pandoras Lunchbox, Melanie Warner questions what happens during processing and determined like vitamins, phytochemicals are being destroyed or removed in manufacturing and therefore arent particularly abundant in processed juices. Adding them back in wouldnt work from a biological point of view, meaning they dont function effectively when isolated from their natural fruit and vegetable habitat. Furthermore, most companies create vitamins by chemical manipulation and synthesis, not from actual fruits and vegetables.Choosing The Best JuiceSo you must be wondering, are there any store-bought juices that are nutritious to drink? I created this chart below to help you navigate the juice aisles more clearly and choose the best store-bought juice. Thankfully, there are lots of options for us!OrganicIt is absolutely critical that you choose organic juice first and foremost. The amount of pesticides that you could be consuming could be astronomical otherwise. We know that increased exposure to pesticides islinkedto birth defects, nerve damage and cancer.The Presidents Cancer Panelhas urged us not to consume food sprayed with pesticides and doesnt believe any amount is safe.RawIn an ideal world, you would always be able to consume a juice raw straight out of a juicer. Enzymes, vitamins and minerals start to degrade over time, so timing is important. If your juice is fresh, its important to drink it as soon as possible.Cold-PressedCold-pressing is the most nutritious way to obtain juice. First, the produce is ground into a fine pulp. Then a press applies thousands of pounds of pressure to the pulp extracting every ounce of juice that the fruit or vegetable has to give. This process gets all the vital nutrients from the pulp into the juice.Cold-Pressed juices have a longer shelf life than centrifuge or slow juicers. Juice Press, Organic Avenue, andLunas Living Kitchen(One of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte!)all have raw organic cold-pressed juice available for purchase in their stores. Health food stores like Whole Foods sometimes makes their cold press juices in advance or carries brands like Suja, that are found in the refrigerator section.HPPThe next best thing to raw in-store cold pressed juice is HPP orHigh Pressure Processing. This method retains food quality, maintains freshness, and extends microbiological shelf life without the addition of heat. After juices are bottled, a high level of cool pressure is applied evenly to destroy any pathogens and ensure the juice is safe to drink while preserving all of the vitamins, enzymes and nutrients. Grocery stores like Whole Foods likes selling HPP juices because they safeguard the consumer from foodborne illnesses more effectively than raw juices. Suja is a popular organic juice brand that uses HPP, but also cold-presses their juice (and gave money in support of GMO labeling  yeah!). Their Twelve Essentials is one of my favorites. They also recently developed a line called Suja Elements that is more like a smoothie. Its the type of product youd choose over Naked Juice, Odwalla, or Bolthouse Farms Smoothies  since all of those are traditionally pasteurized with heat and can contain additives. See this smoothie comparison chart below for details:Finding Organic Pressed Juice Near YouMy friend Max Goldbergcreated theworlds first Pressed Juice Directory, where you can find organic juice wherever you are. He created this directory because he (like me) tries to eat 100% organic whenever possible and wanted the ability to find quality juice on the road while he traveled. I cant thank him enough for this amazing tool! It makes finding organic juice and traveling so much easier.If you have any questions about choosing the best store-bought juice, let me know in the comments below.Also, if you know someone in your life that is still drinking a juice thats on the worst side of the chart above, please share this post with them. Spreading awareness about how our food is produced and which companies we should support will change the marketplace!Ive seen this with my own eyes Food Babe471K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

How Pepperidge Farm Duped My Family,http://foodbabe.com/2013/06/26/how-pepperidge-farm-duped-my-family/,"This is a picture of me on my first birthday. My father was clearly holding me back from taking a chunk out of my cake with my hand. Now I dont remember this day exactly  but I do remember this Pepperidge Farm Golden 3 Layer cakebecause we had it more than just on my 1st birthday, we ate it all of the time. I also remember having the worst asthma and allergies as a child too, but of course did not realize those symptoms were related to what I was eatingMy parents were the first people in their respective families to come to America from India and did not have a slew of homemade family cake recipes to choose from when celebrating events. Growing up, my Mom did make the BEST Indian desserts ever, but that didnt matter. My family wanted to celebrate like everyone else in America  with cake! I remember this cake so vividly and can almost taste it in my mouth right now. We had it countless times throughout the years. It came out of the freezer section in a white box and I will never forget having to wait forseveral long grueling minutesfor it to thaw on the counter.Little did we know at the time, but we were clearly being duped. What we thought we were getting and what we actually ended up consuming were 2 totally different things. My poor unsuspecting foreign parents figured it was frozen because it had been baked fresh (probably on a farm like the label suggested) and needed to be preserved. They were clueless to the fact that it was actually preserved not by freezing, but by a slew of chemicals and other artificial ingredients that helped keep it from breaking down, and to keep it fresh.GMOs were not in production or even invented yet on my 1st birthday  so this cake went from pretty bad to REALLY bad in the late 1990s when food companies like Pepperidge Farm started sneaking GMOs into our food. This was right around the time I left the house for college and discovered Costco cake, which I thought was better (butthats another story) and stopped eating this cake.Looking back at this photo, I wanted to understand why the heck a company named after a farm would sell junk food filled with garbage like this? I was downright shocked when I learned the history of Pepperidge Farm and how it started.The founder Margaret Rudkin had a son who was asthmatic and had an allergy to commercially baked products that contained preservatives and artificial ingredients. He would have terrible reactions when he ate the bread sold in their towns local bakery, so she decided to make her own bread without additives. The sons doctor saw an immediate improvement in her sons allergies after making the switch to home baked bread and started to recommend her bread to his patients with asthma. He eventually convinced Margaret to sell the baked goods to small grocers throughout the area. She named the company after her familys farm  Pepperidge. Her baked goods became very popular especially after she visited Europe to discover what is known as the Milano cookie and Goldfish cracker from Switerzerland and brought it back to the states to sell her own licensed version. Campbell Soup bought her company in 1961 and Margaret continued as the head of the company until she died in 1967. I am not sure when Campbell Soup completely destroyed the integrity and quality of her products  but looking at the ingredients in Pepperidge Farm products today, there is NO WAY these ingredients would be considered natural, free of artificial ingredients, additives and preservatives, like Margaret originally intended for her products.Case in point  Gold Fish is being sued right now for misleading labeling and false advertising. On the label of Gold Fish it states Natural and No Artificial Preservatives, however, the product is made with genetically engineered ingredients (GMOs)  namely canola or soybean oil. How can a company claim something is natural when they are using ingredients made in a laboratory?Remember there is nothing natural about taking DNA, a virus or bacteria from one species and inserting it into another. GMOs are man made, not tested for long term human safety and pose disastrous consequences to our water, land and the entire food supply.Ive been quoted before saying that I think Gold Fish is one of the most dangerous products on supermarket shelves. The reason I say this is because they are so friendly, unassuming, made with smiles and look natural enough for millions of families to feed them to themselves and their children. In actuality, they are nothing more than refined white flour colored with annatto, made with GMO oils and a certain special ingredient called autolyzed yeast that is actually a hidden form of MSG. This ingredient is probably the most disastrous because it stimulates the brain cells to remember a taste, make you want more and enhance the flavor of something that would other wise not taste as addicting. This is the first cracker that millions of children eat and this has to stop.When I saw a new product on the shelf from Pepperidge Farm called Baked Naturals  I thought it was a pretty daring move considering the recent lawsuit and all the potential GMO ingredients it contains in the form of various oils, cornstarch and soy lecithin.Recently, I was delighted to find out Pepperidge Farm removed artificial coloring from their line of Gold Fish and created a new Mac & Cheese product that is colored naturally. However, it would have been nice for them to leave out the yeast extract  another form of hidden MSG and possible GMOs in the form of maltodextrin.There is even Gold Fish shaped 100% whole wheat bread that is full of GMOs, preservatives and other ingredients likecarrageenanthat are seriously questionable because of their link to intestinal inflammation. So many moms are buying this product for their children thinking it is natural and healthy, but that cant be farther from the truth.Pepperidge Farms Light Style Wheat bread has fooled me in the past. I thought I hit the jackpot, getting to eat two slices of bread for 80 calories, but the only person hitting the jackpot was Pepperidge Farm by taking my money and millions of other peoples money and selling us cheap ingredients in the form of GMOs, high fructose corn syrup, dough conditioners (DATEM is linked to asthma), preservatives and artificial sugars.The artificial sweetener Sucralose (a.k.a. Splenda) is added to keep the calories down, make it unnaturally sweet and get you addicted. Recent research out of Europe showedrats developed leukemiaafter consuming Sucralose. This is obviously an ingredient no one should be consuming especially if you are trying to lose weight.Diet breads are worthless when they contain artificial sweeteners because they increase sugar cravings and promote weight gain.Thats right  consuming artificial sweeteners actually increases your appetite. Think about it  when someone consumes something that is sweet, but it has little to no calories  their brain receives a signal to want more calories because their body is not actually getting any energy (i.e. enough calories) to get satisfied. So that person keeps looking for gratification elsewhere and ends up craving more.The thing that makes me the most angry about Pepperidge Farm cookies is their fancy packaging. Its like they were specially made just for me with those fancy compartments divided with paper cupcake holders. They make it seem like you are buying such a premium upscale and high quality product  it even says the word Distinctive on the label. These Milano cookies, along with other flavor varieties contain nothing but cheap worthless ingredients that do nothing in terms of nutrition for your body. Quality cookies do not contain partially hydrogenated oils, but instead real butter.If Margaret Rudkin were alive today  what would she think? Do you think she would have sold her company to Campbell Soup knowing that her products would turn into the same ones that caused her son so much trouble?Luckily, I havent seen any Pepperidge Farm products in my familys pantry for a long time now and I hope it stays that way. I obviously havent bought this brand in a while and thankfully dont have bad asthma or allergies anymore either.If you know someone who still buys Pepperidge Farm products, please share this post with them.There is no more integrity left in their brand and they do not deserve anyones hard earned money.Wishing you the greatest health imaginable,Food Babe273K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

Birke Reports: What’s Really In Your Local Meat?,http://foodbabe.com/2013/05/13/birke-reports-gmos-in-meat/,"This post is written by Birke Baehr, a 14 year-oldorganic farming advocate and author.I am thrilled Birke is a regular contributor here on Food Babe, inspiring other children and adults across the nation to eat local, Non-GMO and organic.Hey everyone! I am so thankful to Vani & the Food Babe blog for having me on as a guest blogger.As some of you may know I am a youth advocate for sustainable food & farming. I am very concerned about the production of genetically engineered food and crops. Im also a large supporter of getting to know your farmer. I believe everyone should buy local and that it is important to be able to shake hands with the person that grew your food. Im always visiting farms and getting to see how the farmers raise their animals and/or produce.When talking to the majority of my local pasture based dairy or meat farmers, I always ask if they use any type of supplemental feed usually made from corn or soy. If they do use any, I ask them if it contains any genetically engineered ingredients. I usually hear from them that itdoes containgenetically modified (GMO) products and this fact upsets me.The one thing I get told time and time again is that non-GMO feed or even organic feed is too expensive.Every time I hear a farmer blame the price of non-GMO feed for not using it, I become even more determined to find a solution for them.We must not only pay attention to GMO ingredients in additives and in raw form, but we must keep an eye out for 2nd generationGMO food, likefeed or grain for livestock.Many people dont realize that they are consuming GMO food when they buy non-organic or local meat. If you buy local (or grass-finished, or pasture raised)  you are doing a great thing, but when the farmer is using GMO food to feed the livestock that can be passed down to you.GMO food that is fed to animals has been linked to sickening them with diseases, like kidney & liver toxicity, cancer, infertility, birth defects, and death.Scientists have found genetically engineered D.N.A. in animal tissue, that we end up consuming in the end.We must find a solution to this issue. I want to help farmers source local non-GMO or organic feed for a fair price. A co-op of produce farmers, land owners, seed suppliers, and monetary backers should be formed. A co-op would have three key benefits:Stop farmers from having to truck feed from across the country.Eliminate farmers having to resort to GM feed.Help farmers obtain organic feed without having to pay a fortune.This idea I hope will sprout up across the country in many different regions, so the farmers and everyone involved will make money. We need to let our farmers know every time we go to the market, we will not settle for GMO feed. Until this idea becomes reality, I dont mind paying the extra price for the farmers that do use organic feed because in the end the real price well pay will be our health and well being.If you are raising livestock and looking for non-GMO feed  check out the resource guide from the non-GMO shopping guidehere. (Especially for all you backyard chicken folks!)And remember to buy organic meat or avoid conventional meat altogether if you want to stop consuming 2nd generation GMO food. I know Food Babe highly suggests this all the time.Thanks for Reading!BirkeMore About Birke Baehr  An Internationally recognized speaker and youth advocate for sustainable food and agriculture, Birke has visited and volunteered at farms around the United States and recently published his first book, Birke On The Farm.

From One Babe To Another: #DumpKraft,http://foodbabe.com/2013/04/15/from-one-babe-to-another-dump-kraft/,"I want to share a letter I sent today to the man behind the newest Kraft Commercial. Kraft is using this new campaign to distract peoples attention away from the petroleum based artificial dyes they use in Mac & Cheese to hot sexy abs. Lets not let them detract from the real issue at hand.Watch the the latest Kraft Commercial Video HEREDear Anderson Davis, akaThe Zesty Guy,Hi, its Vani Hari aka the Food Babe here! From one babe to another, Ive got something really important to ask you. I saw the recent Kraft commercial you are starring in, and boy was it hot! So it got me thinking. Kraft is one of the largest food companies here in the US, and it makes total sense why they would want your face on their brand especially after all the negative publicity they have experienced as of late with another babe, me. The reason why they want to change the conversation to your face and abs is because they dont want Americans to know they are being exploited. Let me explain.I recently discovered that several American brands are using harmful additives that are not used  and in some cases banned  in other countries. One of those products is an iconic staple that almost every American has had at one time or another: Kraft Macaroni and Cheese. Kraft Macaroni and Cheese in the US contains the artificial food dyes Yellow 5 and Yellow 6 made from petroleum, however Kraft reformulated this product in the U.K. using natural dyes, paprika and beta carotene when they found out these dyes were going to require a warning label.These unnecessary  yet potentially harmful dyes are linked to hyperactivity in children, asthma, allergies, migraines and are contaminated with carcinogens (substances that cause cancer!).The worst part, all of Krafts Mac & Cheese products marketed towards children contain these artificial dyes. I noticed you are a family man and have children. Would you let your child be pumped up with questionable petroleum-based ingredients and support a company that uses them here but not in other countries? How can we trust Kraft with our children? It is completely unfair to us that Kraft has reformulated the exact same product in other countries without petroleum. Dont we deserve the same safer version our friends get overseas?Well, you are not alone, actually over 280,000 people thought it was unfair too and last month signed a petition to ask Kraft to remove these dyes. Many of the people who signed the petition have either been affected by these dyes themselves or have had children who have experienced negative consequences. The letters I have personally received are heartbreaking.After basically no response from Kraft (other than this letter to their fans), I decided to go to Chicago and deliver the signatures to their front door step on the same day they launched your new commercial (coincidence, I think not). Because of social media pressure, they eventually caved and let me in for a discussion, however all they did was just reiterate their position, and asked me to agree to disagree with them. Kraft does not put the safety of their consumers as their highest priority, rather it is their bottom line, and they confirmed this during my meeting with them.Kraft obviously missed a huge opportunity to do the right thing, and now many concerned consumers are boycotting not only Mac & Cheese, but their entire line of products  including the dressing you are so famously known for now. So lets talk about this dressing. Kraft Zesty Italian contains a couple of ingredients you should know about ASAP.Vinegar, Water, Soybean Oil, Canola Oil, Sugar, Salt, Contains Less Than 2% of Garlic*, Garlic, Red Bell Peppers*, Onions*, Xanthan Gum, Spice, Oleoresin Paprika, Potassium Sorbate And Calcium Disodium Edta (to Protect Freshness). *Dried.The ingredients in red above are likely all GMO (Genetically Modified Organisms). Oh you dont know what GMOs are?Let me fill you in on that too.GMOs are not sexy.Theyare ingredients that are made in a laboratory with seeds that have been injected with DNA from another plant, animal or virus. GMOs (Genetically Modified Organisms) threaten our entire farmland and there has been no long term testing on humans, even though they were sneaked into our food supply in the late 1990s. Companies like Kraft dont want you to know they are using them, in fact, they spent 2 million dolllars last year against the labeling of these GMOs. Over 64 countries label or regulate GMOs, but companies like Kraft are preventing that from happening here because they value their pocketbook over Americans health.You used to play baseball right?Considering all of this, I find it hard for you to really want to be on the same team as Kraft  promoting not only GMO dressing, but supporting a company that is exploiting Americans for profit. I watched a couple of your recent interviews and you seem like a such a nice down to earth guy, so I hope youll consider this request.I am asking you to end your relationship with Kraft until they listen to over 280,000 people who signed the petition to remove dyes from Mac & Cheese. It doesnt help your image to be part of a dishonest, deceptive and hypocritical brand. To most people, it looks like you sold out for the bad guys, but I think this can be turned around pretty quickly and make you look like a hero. And besides, The Hero Guy will sound way cooler to your kids anyways.You recently said on Twitter and Facebook,if you could do it all over again youd be a country music star. Its not too late for that either. I will even help you come up with a song to sing about the GMOs in Kraft dressing if you like. Continuing to be The Zesty Guy will only make you look like The Sellout Guy. Its time to follow your true passion and dump Kraft.I hope we can be friends one day, us babes need to stick together (but um not like that, I have a husband for goodness sakes!).I have faith that you will make the right decision, if you have the brains to match those good looks.Love,Food BabePLEASE TAKE ACTION AND SHARE THIS LETTER:Help me and 280,000+ other voices get heard and tell The Zesty Guy to end his relationship with Kraft until Kraft removes artificial dyes from Mac & Cheese.

Fox’s Buckley Report: The Food Babe Takes On Processed Foods,http://foodbabe.com/foxs-buckley-report-the-food-babe-takes-on-processed-foods/,
A “Food Babe Investigates” Win – Chipotle Posts Ingredients,http://foodbabe.com/2013/03/24/a-food-babe-investigates-win-chipotle-posts-ingredients/,"On my birthday last Friday, I received an AMAZING present. It was an email from Chris Arnold, the Communications Director at Chipotle, that read Tadah! in the subject line and had a link attached to the body of the email.The link directed me to the Chipotles website where they finally released a comprehenstive list of all their ingredients online.Back in August of last year, I did an investigationthat ultimately left me frustrated with the company. When inquiring about the ingredients  I was met with significant challenge and had to work my way around the corporate headquarters to actually find out the ingredients.Heres an excerpt and infographic from my investigation that sums up my experience quite nicely When I emailed Chipotle asking for the ingredients in certain products they downright refused. They in turn asked if I was concerned about a specific ingredient or had an allergy. Really? Why do I have to be concerned about a specific ingredient or have an allergy to want to know what I am eating and whats in my food? When I tried to call them, there was no way for me to leave a message or get a person on the phone to answer my questions. Email responses were S-L-O-W. I had to ask very specific questions to get the data I needed to write this  specific questions that most consumers would likely not ask. Thank goodness for the genuinely accommodating employee who shared some of the ingredients with me (behind his Managers back) so I could give you the full story.A few weeks after my investigation, Chris from Chipotle contacted me and asked me to meet with him, so I could better understand their challenges with posting their ingredient list. Ive been in contact with him ever since  asking for periodic updates and making sure he knew I wasnt going to let Chipotle off the hook. To keep the pressure on, some folkswere so inspired by theinvestigation, that they created apetition on my behalf, where 2400+ people shared their voice in concern.  So that begs the question  whats really in Chipotles food now that we can easily find the ingredients and read them for ourselves? Some of the original results of my investigation still hold true  but Chipotle made a major oil switch in some of their products like the black beans that dont use GMO oil any longer and has made a fanastic committment to eliminate the transfat, preservatives and other GMO ingredients in the future.As you can see  putting pressure on companies to change their ingredients and petitioning them to change their practices leads to actual results. We together are changing the food system  and today we have a win in terms of true transparency and knowing whats in our food!If you live in Manhattan  Chipotle is using rice bran oil instead of the GMO soybean oil for meat preparation  so for you lucky New Yorkers, you can avoid the GMO oil they currently use in their chicken and beef.For the rest of us, in the meantime, I still wouldnt order the chicken, beef, tortilla products, rice, salad dressing or chips  those items still contain GMO soybean oil. In several states, the chips and corn tortillas have benzoic acid  a preservative that I would avoid at all costs. Studies have shown this ingredient to be linked to decreased good bacteria in the gut in animal studies. The Mayo Clinic reported that this preservative increaseshyperactivityin children. Also, when this acid combines with ascorbic acid (vitamin C), it can form benzene,carcinogen that damages DNA in cells and accelerates aging.Chipotles burrito and flour taco shells havepartially hydrogenated vegetable oils (a.k.a. trans fat). A 40-calorie-per-day increase in trans fat intake can lead to a23% higher risk of heart disease. 40 calories is a mere 2% of a typical 2000 calorie per day diet. Trans fats can be deadly even in a small amount and as you can see will easily add up if you go over one serving size.Also the pinto beans, contain pork bacon and have sodium nitrate  a substance linked tocancer,heart disease,anddiabetes.I have to be completely honest, I havent been to Chipotle in over six years, but I wouldnt be shy about eating there again now that I know I can order some options without GMOs, preservatives, and transfat. Im actually pretty excited about that fact.This is what my order would look like if I went there A salad with:Organic black beansRomaine lettuceFresh tomato salsa (and maybe try the others without the corn)A huge serving of guacamolePossibly sour cream or cheese if I were feeling fancyIf you are a meat eater  you could add pork carnitas to that list  since they do not use any GMO oil during the cooking preparationI hope you celebrate this accomplishment with me and praise Chipotle for their changes.Its a great day in the world  however, we have a lot more work to do, dont we? I can only wonder when Kraft will have the courage to meet with us and address the concerns of over 270,000+ consumers.Food BabeP.S.

Are Over-The-Counter Medicines Making You Sick?,http://foodbabe.com/2013/02/26/are-over-the-counter-medicines-making-you-sick/,"Food is thy medicine. but can medicine be thy food?Well yes it can. There are certain hidden ingredients labeled inactive in several over-the-counter and prescription based drugs that could be harming you and your family. The fact that they are called inactive is a detraction from what they really areanything you put in your body is active and heres the information you need to know.Let me start by telling you a personal storyA few years ago I had a crazy metallic taste develop in my mouth that I just couldnt get rid of. It goes without saying, it was annoying and very alarming to be tasting metal in my mouth on a constant basis. As a result, I went to my acupuncturist and my regular doctor looking for answers. They had me eliminate fish from my diet (because of possible mercury poisoning), had my blood checked, and they did everything possible to find out what the heck was happening. No one could figure it out even after all the tests came back.There was only one pharmaceutical drug I was taking at the time  a little blue birth control pill. To my surprise, my pharmacist made the decision to give me the generic version instead of the brand version that month. Of course my acupuncturist and doctor both asked me if I had been taking any new drugs/vitamins, etc  and my answer was no  but little did I realize at the time I was taking something totally different. Generic versions of pills can contain all sorts of additives, artificial colors and ingredients that make them chemically different from the brand version. It is a routine practice for drug companies to vary the exact combination of inactive ingredientsto avoid patent infringement on brand name drugs and to make their appearance more appealing and last longer on the shelf .Shortly, after I switched back to my brand version of birth control pills, the metallic taste in my mouth magically disappeared. (FYI  2 years ago, I decided to stop taking birth control pills because I did not like what I uncovered about them and regret taking them at all, but thats a topic for another time). Finally figuring out that the generic version of the drug was quite different than the original was ground breaking to my understanding what inactive ingredients can do to you.And thats why I decided to look into the most popular household cold and flu medicines out there and investigate the actual ingredients in them.Cold medicines like NYQUIL, Robitussin, Alka Seltzer and Triaminic have been around for decades and you, as well as your grandparents have probably used them. I still remember the taste of original orange flavored Triaminic  as my parents gave it to me every time I had a cold.The main problem with many of these drugs is that back in the day the FDA did not perform rigorous testing on them. Instead they were only required to give them a stamp of GRAS or Generally Regarded As Safe and many of the inactive ingredients were not sufficiently tested. Although new drugs are tested more thoroughly now, drugs like pseudoephedrine were often grandfathered in.Are these medicines really healing us or just putting a bandaid on symptoms that have no effect on us actually getting better?According to Dr. Bruce Barrett, a leading cold researcher at the University of Wisconsin, cough and cold drugs have an effectiveness rate of only 20% of reducing symptoms and virtually zero effectiveness in actually removing the bacteria or virus out from your system.Dr. Michael Carome, Deputy Director of the advocacy group Public Citizen, agrees. He states that these drugs have more debilitating side effects than benefit. For example, decongestants can work in reverse and cause rebound stuffiness and cardiac arrhythmia; cough syrups make you drowsy, fever reducers like acetaminophen can wreak havoc on your liver, while others can irritate your gastrointestinal system.So why do so many people still take these over-the-counter drugs?A study published in 2010 by Harvard Medical School found that placebo pills are just as effective as taking drugs when it comes to non-life-threatening chronic conditions. Which basically means our belief that something is working is sometimes all we need! The placebo effect has been documented over centuries and several natural medicine doctors believe our thoughts can be powerful healers.Additionally, when drug manufacturers createmarketing campaigns depicting quick recovery from illness after consuming their productsof families going from in-the-bed sick back to school and/or work in commercials and advertisements  our brains get hooked to the message and we believe these drugs are actually working, when all they are doing is producing side effects we could definitely live without as well as allexposing us to potentially toxic and unhealthy inactive ingredients.Most of the over-the-counter medicines you find at drug stores have several inactive ingredients that could be harming you with substances you didnt even know you were consuming. GMOsThe doctors that belong to the American Academy of Environmental Medicinecalled on All physicians to educate their patients, the medical community, and the public to avoid GM (genetically modified) foods when possible and provide educational materials concerning GM foods and health risks.If you are trying to remove GMOs from your diet  youve got to make sure to look in your medicine cabinet too. All of these over-the-counter cold and flu remedies here listed have potential ingredients that contain GMOs. Many of the ingredients are hidden sources of GMOs. (See a full list of GMO ingredients here)For example, notice the partially hydrogenated cottonseed & soy oil a.k.a. transfat in Zicam, high fructose corn syrup in NYQUIL and Robitussin, and soy lecithin in Halls cough drops.There have been no long term human studies on GMOs and preliminary studies on animals show horrific consequences.A studyshowed GMOs causedtoxic and allergic reactions, sick, sterile, and dead livestock, and damage to virtually every organ studied in lab animals.Anotherstudyrevealed that female rats fed GMO soy for 15 months showedsignificant health issuesin their uterus and reproductive cycle, compared to rats fed organic soy or those raised without soy.A 2009 French Study concluded that Glyphosate (used on GMO soy) cankill the cellsin the outer layer of the human placenta, theorgan that connects the mother to her fetus, providing nutrients and oxygen and emptying waste products.A Russian study conducted on hamsters that were fed GMO soy diets for two years over three generations found that by the third generation,most of the hamsters lost the ability to have babies, showed slower growth, and suffereda higher mortality rate.Chemical PreservativesSodium Benzoate and/or Benzoic Acid are cautionary preservatives found in cough syrups like Robitussin. The Mayo Clinic reported that this preservative increases hyperactivityin children. Also, when sodium benzoate combines with ascorbic acid (vitamin C), it can form benzene,carcinogen that damages DNA in cells and accelerates aging.Dimethylpolysiloxane is ananti-foaming agent and type of silicone used in caulks and sealants and as a filler for breast implants. Its commonly used in fried fast food items  even McDonalds new Fish McNuggets have this ingredient added to it. Its also the key ingredient insilly putty. This agent might not kill you  but do we really need to be consuming a chemical cocktail of synthetic ingredients when we are sick or at all?Artificial SugarsSaccarin (a.k.a Sweet n Low), Aspartame, Sucralose (a.k.a. Splenda), Acesulfame Potassium, etc. are all chemically derived sugars with absolutely no nutritional value at all and can be dangerous.Saccarin which is found in Robitussin and NYQUIL is one to avoid at ALL costs.The Center for Science in the Public Interest (CSPI)has reported the studies showing saccharin causes cancer in the urinary bladder, lungs, ovaries, uterus, and other organs in animals and also increases the potency of other cancer-causing chemicals.Over 10,000 complaints have been filed with the FDA on Aspartame since 1980 and has actually never been proven to be safe before it was approved for use in our food supply. It has been linked to diabetes, auto-immune disorders, depression (which can cause you to eat more  once again), birth defects, and several forms of cancer.CSPI also states Acesulfame-K or Acesulfame Potassium is anything but safe. Two rat studies suggest that the additive might cause cancer, but these studies were never addressed by the FDA before they approved the substance to also be used by in 1970. In addition, it is mentioned that large doses of acetoacetamide (a breakdown product of this sugar) have been shown to affect the thyroid in rats, rabbits, and dogs. This toxic sugar substitute can be found in Alka Seltzer, Triaminic and NYQUIL.Artificial ColorsCan they really call artificial dye inactive when it has been proven to causehyperactivityin children? All of these drugs  NYQUIL, Mucinex,Robitussin, Halls, Alka Seltzer, Triaminic, and Zicamhave artifical colors. These artificial colors are made in a lab with same chemicals used in petroleum productionand are consideredknown carcinogensby many consumer watch agencies. How is taking petroleum which is used in gasoline going to help your immune system long term? Why are these substances even in medicines to begin with? Arent medicines suppose to heal you?So What Do You Do The Next Time You Get A Cold/Allergies/Flu?There are a LOT of natural remedies out there that work. so I want to share the top 5 that have worked for me. Please note these remedies are just on top of my regular habits of exercise, taking probiotics, eating a plant-based diet and drinking warm water with lemon and cayenne first thing every morning that all improve my immune system and help me ward off colds as much as possible.Use A Neti Pot neti pot is aceramic pot that looks like a cross between a small teapot and Aladdins magic lamp and used to irrigate the nasal cavities and has been used for centuries! Almost immediately at the sign of a cold, I grab my netty pot, filtered water (very important that it is filtered), some salt and a little bit of baking soda and go straight into my bathroom to clean out my nasal passages. This practice usually reduces the amount of time I have a cold or immediately stops it from becoming full blown. Also, I love using it in allergy season or when Ive been around allergens in an old house with mold or around animals I am allergic to.Avoid Sugar Like the Plague  Sugar absolutely wreaks havoc on the body when you arent sick, but when you are sick and you eat sugar  you are multiplying the harmful effects further weakening the immune system and creating even more inflammation in your body. Sugar is one the key ingredients that bacteria and viruses feed off in your body, thats why if you get a cold its important to stay away from candy, cakes, ice-cream, all those types of items that are extraordinary high in sugar if you want to get better fast.Juice with Ginger and Garlic If you can stand it, add garlic and ginger root to your green juice. They both have amazing anti-bacterial and anti-inflammatory properties that can get you better in no time! I havent had a cold last more than 2 days as a result of drinking green juice like this on a regular basis, especially when I have symptoms of a cold.Stay Hydrated  I avoid caffeine and drink an extraordinary amount of water based substances like hot soups, hot teas and just plain water. I dont recommend gatorade  but these alternatives instead. Also  if you have kids, try this homemade version of Pedialyte  you dont want to go anywhere near that branded hoax of a product either.Acupuncture & Chinese Herbs When I get sickI rarely go to a conventional medical doctor now  I almost always first see my Acupuncturist. A treatment is sometimes all I need to help move a virus or bacteria infection out of my system. Also  I take combination of medicinal Chinese herbs as soon as I get a sign of a cold (usually the first sign for me is a scratchy throat) and/or to lessen the severity or duration of colds. One time when I had a crazy astronomical fever, I was able to reduce it just by taking these herbs. (Please note  I am not a doctor or Chinese medicinepractitioner please do not use this information as medical advice for you personally.)My goal in sharing this information with you is not to scare you into believing this stuff will kill you (although, it likely will slowly over time), but to inspire you to look at all the chemicals that being pushed at us by the pharmaceutical and food industries. We dont need to consume these chemicals  our bodies were not made to consume them and we certaintly dont need them to feel better.If you think this post could benefit someone in your life  please share it  you could be a life saver.Wishing You The Best Health Always,Food Babe90.4K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

How To Detox After Vacation (or anytime!),http://foodbabe.com/2013/01/09/how-to-detox-after-vacation-or-anytime/,"No. Im not making out with my juice. This is what happens when I find juice on vacation. I cherish every ounce of goodnessThis was a mix of carrots, cucumbers, celery and sprouts.It was one of my only pure vegetables juices I had while traveling last month. I had it in Cusco, Peru, where juice was available all over the placebut we were sadly only there a few days.For the last part of last year and early part of this year  Ive been a traveling mad woman, hence the lack of juice (and I had ZERO kale. The horror.). For instance, just in the last month, Ive taken 15 different flights. Im not complaining about this at all, because the places (Lima, Cusco, Sacred Valle, Machu Picchu, Paracas, Quito, and the Galapagos Islands) I went were totally INCREDIBLE. I cant wait to share the pictures and our experiences with you but first I must get back on track.After all the travel, my body is SCREAMING for a detox, routine, normality and just to be home for a while. (My mind on the other hand has a different plan, already planning the next tripahhhh). And to be completely honest, even though Ive been following most of my healthy habits on the road (if you dont know what they are and wish to find out  subscribe here to get a list!), I havent been watching how much Ive been eating nor have I been on my regular schedule of exercise or yoga (I forgot myyoga travel mat at home  big mistake!). I find it funny, actually, that Im getting back on track during this month the month of January, when everyone and their neighbor is trying to do the same (not a bad thing, just the truth) Years past, because of my heavily plant based clean eating lifestyle, I havent really needed to lose weight or detox during this specific month (the beauty of living and eating organically!) but this year Im with the rest of the folks, trying desperately to feel as good as I did last year.These are some simple steps I take to get back on track. The best part is that you can use any of them anytime of year, not just after vacation.Drink Dandelion Tea This stuff is DYNAMITE for reducing that initial swelling or bloating after traveling. It also significantly reduces water retention after a heavily salted diet. I have found that eating out almost always guarantees salt bloat. Even after asking the waiters in South America to reduce the amount of salt in my food on several occasions, it never actually happened it perhaps got lost in translation but I didnt worry too much, because I packed dandelion tea with me and always drink it as soon as I get back home.Dandelion stimulates the liver, the primary organ that removes toxins  which is what you want after a trip being exposed to all sorts of things out of your element oh you dont know what I am talking about? Im talking about stuff like . radiation from airplanes and pesticides being sprayed on an airplane and in your food, using hotel sheets, towels, etc washed with detergents that are full of chemicals, blowing your nose and wiping your tush with fragrance filled tissue paper, drinking water from plastic bottles non stop, etc it all adds up and anything to help move those toxins out of my body the better. My favorite brand of dandelion tea is Traditional Medicinals and available hereon Amazon.Daily Wheatgrass Shots  Speaking of removing toxins, there may not be a better way to do that than drinking daily wheatgrass. I have 40 or so reasons listed hereif you dont believe meYou dont have to do a daily shot to get the benefits however, a few times a week is great too, especially after a vacation or the holidays. It is a sure fire way to help speed up your energy, your vibrance and your metabolism. Its very powerful stuff and its potency takes getting used to. I have to sike myself up every time I take a shot but by the end of it all, Im all smiles.Eat Raw Vegetables At Every Meal This might seem like a obvious way to detox but not having any kale for almost a month and trying to determine where I could eat raw vegetables safely was very limiting (most guide books say to avoid raw vegetables when traveling), making this tip very important for my detox plan on return. I didnt even have my usual daily green powders (Green VibranceorVitamineral Greens) with me on my travels either they got lost in a taxi cab in Lima early in the trip. (You are welcome Mr. Taxi Cab Driver Im sure you are feeling great after all those nutrients!) So what is the plan to get more vegetables  and raw ones at that? Its simple  just eat raw vegetables before every meal (including during breakfast), drink daily green juice or green smoothiesIll probably do all three, because I am a vegetable fanatic. Raw vegetables makes me feel AMAZING and are known for removing toxins and healing your body fast.The following daily plan works great with my schedule  a green smoothie for breakfast (FAST to make), raw veggies before my lunch (pre-cut the night before) or a large salad, and a green juice (freshly made after work or bought) before dinner. And of course my actual meals will all consist of even more vegetables to aid in the overall detoxDo a Juice Fast (but not right away)  While my body is still get used to the cold 40 degree weather, coming off of 80s in the Galapagos, Im not quite ready to dive into a juice fast just yet but will be after a week or two back in this environment and eating clean. Thats the key  the detox symptoms of a juice fast are much less severe when you have been eating healthy, mostly raw and clean for at least a week, so I dont recommend starting a fast, day one after a vacation. You definitely want to make the fasting as pleasant as possible and not painful! I will likely do one soon, stay tuned on that but if youd like to read up on one of my previous juice fasts  check out this series of posts, along with some of my favorite juice recipes:Why Juice Fast & PreppingJuice Fast Day 1Juice Fast Day 2 and Juicer TipsJuice Fast Day 3Kickin Kale JuiceRainbow Bite JuiceRavishing Red JuiceSuper Detox JuiceEat at Home  This should be like numero uno on this list. Although I pretty much ordered my food at restaurants my usual way while on vacation following my eating out tips, the amount of high calorie fat (healthy and unhealthy ones too) probably ended up in my food more than I would have liked. Also the variety of food in general wasnt always the best either for instance, there were about 7 days straight the main course for lunch and dinner consisted of fish, corn and potatoes. While those arent terrible foods and wont kill you. I dont normally eat meat more than once a day and rarely eat white potatoes or corn. I am very much looking forward to controlling the amount of oil, salt, starch, etc. in my food and eating organically as much as possible in the coming weeks to counteract all the pesticides and other potentially toxic ingredients I may have encountered.Count Calories Following all the tips above and getting back on my usual routine will likely aid in helping me lose a few pounds I might have gained during my travels but theres no better sure fire way to lose the weight than to follow this tip. When I notice my pants fitting a little snug (for the record, Ill be wearing dresses for the whole month of January, so I dont need to find out how snug they are right now), or I am feeling a bit untonedI count my calories. Most real foodists are probably rolling their eyes at this tipbut to my experience, counting calories WORKS. Its plain and simple  calories in vs. calories out helps you lose weight. Good for you foods can be higher in calories(think avocado, walnuts, coconut oil) and if you eat them freely, not portioned control, its easy to pack on weight especially when they are easier to find and eat on vacation.Of course, if you havent been following a clean chemical-free and organic lifestyle  choosing a diet consisting of whole real plant based food is the first step to feeling great and naturally losing weight but for the folks that have a clean organic lifestyle down pat  calorie counting is the next step to getting the optimal body you want.I like to count calories before a trip and after, because during is no fun! If I count calories before, it gives me a little buffer to indulge on vacation with higher calorie food and of course, counting calories after a trip gets me back where I feel my best.I like to use a BMR Calculator to find out my basal metabolic rate (BMR) and determine the number of calories it takes for me to sustain my weight. For my height and weight  its always around 1300. This means I can consume around 1300 calories every single day and not do a lick of activity and not gain weight. So what I usually do is exercise by burning anywhere between 400-600 calories a day to create a calorie deficit (I use my Polar Heart Rate Monitor to track this) and eat a total 1300-1500 calories a day until I get back down to where I feel great (FYI  this is where my skinny jeans fit nicely). Then I slowly increase my calories to roughly 1800-2000 when I dont need to lose weight. Now, about 80% of the year I dont count calories, because I am in the zone, wearing my skinny jeans, following my habits, not traveling like a crazy person, having a good routine of juicing and smoothies, etc. But when I do count calories, I use an app on my iPhone for that. A food journal works great too. Its totally up to you but the app has helped me get results 100% of the time, because it is so easy to keep up with and I dont have to do the math. I know my body takes about a month to lose 3-4 pounds (there are 3500 calories in a pound), so by March (my birthday month), I know I will be back where I need to be (i.e. feeling good in my skinny jeans  yeah!).Doing yoga with one my best friends in the sand dunes of Huacachina, PeruHot Yoga Now I really believe that 80% of detoxing is what you put in your body but I dont want to discount how hot yoga has helped me detox my body from the inside out. When I do yoga, focusing on my breathing and the postures, it completely eliminates my stress and makes me happy and so energetic. There is no other activity that gives me more pleasure and peace of mind. And its because the yoga poses are designed to hit and bring energy to every organ in the body  improving your digestion, circulation and brain. Practicing in a hot room, allows you to get deeper into the poses (stimulating all the organs that help with detoxing more effectively) and releases some toxins via sweat. There are lot of people that have tried to disprove that toxins are released through sweat  but I dont believe their research or theories at all. I know from my own experience that it works. For example  when I know I havent been eating right or exposed to some element that is harmful or not good for my body, my skin will literally sting after sweating, but if Im practicing clean living, my sweat will not do this to my skin. Ive become so in tune with my body, I know exactly whats going on. Yoga helps with tuning into my body intuition even more. My whole body smiles in joy when I practice. If you havent tried it hot or at all  I highly recommend it!I really want to know if you have tried any of these strategies to get back on track after a vacation or the holidays and if you have any other detox tips to share. Please leave a comment below and share your experience with me and other readersI would love to hear what works for you.And if you find this information could help someone in your life  please share this post, everyone deserves to feel AMAZING after vacation (or anytime!)XOXO,Food Babe185K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

What to Watch out for at Whole Foods,http://foodbabe.com/2012/10/01/what-to-watch-out-for-at-whole-foods/,"If I could give one piece of health advice to everyone I meet Id ask them to shop in a place where they can get the best quality groceries and produce available. Changing where I shop has been fundamental in changing my health for the better.However, going to the grocery store  even natural ones  can be really daunting, especially if you are trying to avoid processed foods. Whole Foods Market stores, known for their organic and natural options, are popping up everywherewe even got one here in my hometown just last month. People inherently trust Whole Foods because their marketing is almost spotless. Whole Foods emotionalizes the shopping experience with visions of abundant good-for-you-eats the moment you walk in the store. They greet you with an array of fresh flowers that immediately invokes a state of freshness, and the high quality standards are touted to easily make anyone believe they are shopping at the best place possible.Whole Foods has a laundry list of chemicals, preservatives and additives they do not allow in their stores that should alleviate most of your worries  an unacceptable list of ingredients that I highly endorse and wish every grocery store followed (albeit, its missing a couple of items). Typical wholesalers and conventional supermarkets are stocked with so many questionable chemicals and ingredients it makes my head spin. This is why Ive pretty much stopped going to conventional grocery stores all together  its just too exhausting to have to avoid all the chemical additives they let into their stores and to have to constantly scrutinize their ingredients.Whole Foods is far superior to conventional grocery stores in terms of what they dont allow in their stores, however I uncovered some facts that will shock even the most savvy consumer.Okay, so back to Whole Foods and what you need to look out for:1. Not Everything is Organic Dont let the fact that they are a certified organic grocery store fool you. Being CCOF certified means practically nothing in terms of how much organic produce they actually have to sell you. Ive been to Whole Foods many times now, and I havent been able to find all of the organic produce I want  most of it is conventional and often flown in from other countries. For instance, I use cucumbers in one of my favorite smoothie recipes right now, and on the last three trips to Whole Foods, organic cucumbers were not available along with several other of my staples I buy on a weekly basis. Buying organic vegetables like cucumbers is very important because they are included in the dirty dozen list  a list of fruits and vegetables that are recommended to purchased only organic because of the high level of pesticide residue found in them. Remember that increased exposure to pesticides are in some cases linked to birth defects, nerve damage, and cancer. The Presidents Cancer Panel has urged us to avoid food sprayed with pesticides and doesnt believe any amount is safe.Chart from Environmental Working GroupI sometimes go to Whole Foods for a quick meal, but its not very often because the prepared foods and salad bar are mostly conventional, too. Its very hard to find an organic meal available at any of their food stations  pizza, deli, sushi, soup, salad, sandwiches, smoothies, etc. Since Im already at the store in the first place, I usually talk myself into buying the organic ingredients I need and preparing them at home rather than making a habit of eating there. On several occasions, Ive found less than stellar ingredients hidden in their prepared foods  like GMOs, hidden MSG and the over use of cheap oils like corn, soy, and canola, which I will get to in a minute.2. Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) are Everywhere If there was one thing I thought I could avoid by shopping at Whole Foods, it would at least be GMOs, especially looking at their quality standards. When you ask the staff about GMOs, like I did just the other day, they will tell you all sorts of different answers on the topic. The inconsistencies in their communications to customers was just recently exposed in an Organic Spies tell-all-video, that used hidden cameras to ask Whole Foods employees about GMOs in their stores. This video uncovered that most employees said there were no GMOs at Whole Foods, however in actuality approximately 20  30% of their stores goods contain GMOs. When I specifically asked the team leader of my store in Charlotte if I could have a list of all the non-GMO products, he said there are absolutely no GMOs in here, we dont have a list. He was so pompous about his answer, that I followed up his bold statements with a couple of questions that were not answered correctly. I did not want to argue with him, so instead, I took pictures of the Kashi, Pirate Booty, Barbaras Bakery, etc. on their shelves  all brands Ive researched that have GMOs.As I explained in my Chipotle Investigation, GMOs were not studied for their safety on humans before they were approved by the FDA, and they do not require labeling in the United States. A recent French Study revealed that rats fed GMOs during the course of their lifetime and exposed to the pesticide Round Up developed tumors all over their bodies and in their internal organs. There has been so much outrage about the alarming results that Russia just last week banned all GMO Corn imports into their country and Europe is considering banning them too.Whole Foods sources non-GMO ingredients for their 365 store brand and supports GMO-labeling in California, where the issue will appear on the ballot as Proposition 37 in November. However, Whole Foods hasnt donated a single cent to the campaign  a large percentage (~$2-3 billion dollars) of their profits are directly tied to the sale of GMOs after all. Their support is superficial at best and a company that makes over $10 billion dollars in revenue should put their money where their mouth is, especially since big food corporations are outspending the effort to label GMOs 11 to 1. Whole Foods has stated they havent donated because they do not contribute to political campaigns. Our right to know is not political  its a basic fundamental human right to know what we are eating. Safeguarding our organic farm land starts with labeling and eliminating GMOs  this is something Whole Foods could have a major impact in protecting and should be committed to, especially wearing the label of a CCOF certified organic grocer.The Non-GMO project and the Institute of Responsible Technology are two resources that provide non-GMO shopping lists. Also check out a list of my favorite organic snack substitutes for popular conventional GMO snacks.3. Hidden Ingredients I know I am preaching to the choir when I say this, but reading the ingredients on everything you buy is still critical, even when you are shopping in Whole Foods! Considering the laundry list of unacceptable ingredients Whole Foods does not allow in their stores  I find it appalling that they still allow brands they carry to use rBGH (a.k.a. recombinant bovine growth hormone) in their dairy products. rBGH has been outlawed in 27 countries and study after study links this genetically modified ingredient to many forms of cancers. It is risky buying conventional dairy products from Whole Foods- buy only organic, 365 brand, or other brands explicitly labeled rBGH free.Additionally, Whole Foods list of unacceptable ingredients does not include propylene glycol, caramel color, carrageenan and several forms of hidden MSG  ingredients that would make logical sense to ban from their stores.Carrageenan is used as a stabilizer in dairy and non-dairy like products and consumption is linked to gastrointestinal disorders. 365 brand cottage cheese, soy milk, flax milk and rice milk all contain carrageenan. You also can find it all over the store in different brands of ice cream, sour cream, etc. (Cornucopia Institute created a helpful shopping guide to help you avoid this additive.)I found yeast extract, a common hidden name for MSG, in soups, sushi, seasonings and in many packaged goods. The amount of MSG that can end up in your food is not regulated by the FDA, but Whole Foods consciously allows it throughout their store. MSG is also likely genetically modified and can be listed under several different names. MSG is an excitotoxin that, in some cases, can excite brain cells to death and cause adverse reactions in some people including skin rashes, itching, hives, nausea, vomiting, migraine headaches, asthma, heart irregularities, depression and even seizures. This list of hidden MSG names is helpful in understanding the various names for MSG so you can look for it on the label and avoid it.Many of Whole Foods prepared foods contain cheap acidic oils  like corn oil seen in this Borscht soup below. This is something I pay a great deal of attention to, because so many processed foods are using these highly refined oils (which are likely genetically modified too) and creating an imbalance of Omega 6 to Omega 3 fatty acids in our bodies. Furthermore, experts are so emphatic about the unhealthy nature of oils like corn, soy, and canola, they recommend discontinuing all use and throwing them in the trash. Switching to unrefined coconut, olive and sesame oils could drastically improve Whole Foods prepared foods and send a loud message that they are putting the health of their customers before their profits.4. High Prices Im sure youve heard the joke that when you shop at Whole Foods you can end up spending your whole pay check! This joke may not be far from truth based on the total cost of some common grocery staples.Prices turned out to only be slightly higher at Whole Foods (depending on what you are buying) when compared to one of their local competitors, Earth Fare. Luckily, you can find many of these items cheaper elsewhere, but it just takes a little effort. I like to keep shopping costs down by buying staples in bulk on the internet, going directly to local farms and visiting farmers markets.In Summary As you can see  Whole Foods may not have all your best interests in mind. Whole Foods has a tremendous opportunity to make a historical impact on our food policy  if they do the right thing. We could all easily find non-organic products, GMOs, and other unwanted ingredients at the rest of Americas supermarkets so lets just hope a store like Whole Foods will lead the way and eventually eliminate these items all together.Im cautiously still a customer because obtaining organic groceries is hard enough as it is; limiting my store choices even more would be silly. Whole Foods, Earth Fare, and other grocery stores that have eliminated laundry lists of chemicals and additives will always be better than conventional grocery stores. I am thankful they make shopping for healthier alternatives much more convenient. Besides, my husband loves having a local craft beer at Whole Foods while I shop  getting him to the grocery store with me is an absolute miracle that Im just not willing to give up!2906@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!

How Food Companies Exploit Americans with Ingredients Banned in Other Countries,http://foodbabe.com/2013/02/12/how-food-companies-exploit-americans-with-ingredients-banned-in-other-countries/,"Thoughts of outrage, unfairness, disbelief, and ultimately grief consumed me while I was doing this investigation. A list of ingredients that are banned across the globe but still allowed for use here in the American food supply recently made news. While I have written about some of those ingredients before, this list inspired me to look a little deeper and find out how pervasive this issue is for us. Could these banned ingredients be contributing to the higher mortality and disease rates here in the U.S.?The health of Americans is downright grim according to a report just released by the Institute of Medicine and the National Research Council. It declares Americans are sicker and die younger than other people in wealthy nations. The United States spends 2.5 times more on health care than any other nation, however, when compared with 16 other nations we come in dead last in terms of health and life expectancy for men and near the bottom for women.Here is the breakdown for you:More than two thirds of United States citizens are overweight  33% being obese.32% of children are either obese or overweight.43% of Americans are projected to be obese in 10 years.After smoking, obesity is Americas biggest cause of premature death and is linked to 70% of heart disease and 80% of diabetes cases.And 41% of Americans are projected to get cancer in their lifetime!These reports and statistics scream the word HELP! Recently, I spent some time down in Mississippi volunteering in the most obese county in the nation. I found that while social and economic factors do play a part in this epidemic, the main culprit was the lack of nutrition education. The victims of obesity are likely the same victims of systematic brainwashing from Big Food marketers, relying on diet soda, low fat products, or looking only at calories on product labels. Basically, they are doing what the food industry has been teaching them about losing weight versus finding out the truth about real food.And thats the problem  the food industry is the one leading our conversation in this country about food and nutrition, educating the mass public about what to eat and what not to eat. Coca-Cola recently even went as far as creating a special campaign to combat obesity  yes you read that right  a sugar filled soda company trying to stop obesity. (You can read my reaction to that here).Unfortunately, the doctors in this country are not exactly leading the discussion either, since nutrition is not currently a focus in medical school. And the government has their hands tied by big food industry and chemical company lobbyists that basically control what the FDA approves, deems safe for human consumption, and our overall food policy. So who is going to finally tell us the truth about our food?The food industry does not want us to pay attention to the ingredients nor do they care about the negative effects from eating them. They certainly dont care about the astronomical medical bills that are a direct result of us eating the inferior food they are creating.The HELP we need starts here. We as a collective nation must stop this trajectory of sickness and rising health care costs, by understanding the ingredients we are putting into our bodies. We must challenge the U.S. food industry to discontinue the use of banned ingredients that are not allowed elsewhere in the world. We deserve to have the same quality food without potential toxins.Food is medicine, and plain and simple, if our food is sick (filled with GMOs, chemicals, additives, artificial ingredients, and/or carcinogens), collectively we as a country are going to continue to be sick.Using banned ingredients that other countries have determined unsafe for human consumption has become a pandemic in this country. To prove this point, I found the best and easiest place to look for evidence was just across the pond in the United Kingdom, where they enjoy some of the same types of products we do  but with totally different ingredient lists. It is appalling to witness the examples I am about to share with you. The U.S. food corporations are unnecessarily feeding us chemicals  while leaving out almost all questionable ingredients in our friends products overseas. The point is the food industry has already formulated safer, better products, but they are voluntarily only selling inferior versions of these products here in America. The evidence of this runs the gamut from fast food places to boxed cake mix to cereal to candy and even oatmeal  you cant escape it.Some of the key American brands that are participating in this deception are McDonalds, Pringles (owned by Kelloggs), Pizza Hut and Quaker (owned by Pepsi), Betty Crocker (owned by General Mills), Starburst (owned by M&M/Mars), and Ritz Crackers (owned by Kraft). In the examples below, red text indicates potentially harmful ingredients and/or ingredients likely to contain GMOs.Having a pre-made box of flour, baking soda and sugar all ready to go saves time for some people when it comes to making a cake, but does saving time have to come at the expense of chemically derived and potentially toxic ingredients? The United States version of Betty Crocker Red Velvet cake not only has artificial colors linked to hyperactivity in children, food cravings, and obesity, but it also has partially hydrogenated oils (a.k.a. trans fat). Trans fat has been shown to be deadly even in small amounts. Previous trials have linked even a 40-calorie-per-day increase in trans fat intake to a 23% higher risk of heart disease. This could easily be the amount of trans fat in one serving of Betty Crocker icing alone.Sodium benzoate is an ingredient that Coca-Cola actually removed in their Diet Coke product overseas, but youll still find it in their product Sprite, cake mixes and loads of other products across the USA. The Mayo Clinic reported that this preservative increases hyperactivity in children. Also, when sodium benzoate combines with ascorbic acid (vitamin C), it can form benzene, a carcinogen that damages DNA in cells and accelerates aging.Fast Food giants like McDonalds and Pizza Hut are just as guilty as General Mills Betty Crocker. Look closely at the ingredients in McDonalds french fries above. Do you see how the french fries in the U.K. version are basically just potatoes, vegetable oil, a little sugar and salt? How can McDonalds make french fries with such an uncomplicated list of ingredients all over Europe, but not over here? Why do McDonalds french fries in the U.S. have to have TBHQ, trans fat and anti-foaming agents? Correct me if Im wrong, but the last time I checked  I didnt think Americans liked foam with their fries either! The anti-foaming agent  dimethylpolysiloxane  is a type of silicone used in caulks and sealants and as a filler for breast implants. Its also the key ingredient in silly putty. Thanks FDA for allowing companies to put silly putty in our french fries. Seriously  this is out of control. McDonalds Strawberry Sauce in the United States includes high fructose corn syrup, red #40 and sodium benzoate, while the citizens of the U.K. get off scot-free. Instead, they get 37% real strawberries in their product and no additional flavoring or harmful preservatives.Pizza Hut does a huge disservice to us (and their workers) by using Azodicarbonamide in their garlic cheese bread. This ingredient is banned as a food additive in the U.K., Europe, and Australia, and if you get caught using it in Singapore you can get up to 15 years in prison and be fined $450,000. The U.K. has recognized this ingredient as a potential cause of asthma if inhaled, and advises against its use in people who have sensitivity to food dye allergies and other common allergies in food, because azodicarbonamide can exacerbate the symptoms. However, Pizza Hut and many other fast food chains like Subway and Starbucks use this ingredient in their U.S. bread products.Natural and artificial flavors and hidden MSG (in the form of autolyzed yeast extract, in this case) are commonly found throughout products in America but not elsewhere. Junk food companies intentionally add this combination of ingredients to create sensory overload by exciting your brain cells to remember the food you are eating and make less nutritious ingredients taste better to you. Im not saying that the food industry has completely eliminated these same tricks abroad  but when you look at the U.K. version of garlic cheese bread, the ingredients look pretty basic. Many of the ingredients you could use at home to make garlic bread. Ive never found TBHQ in the baking aisle at the grocery store, have you? TBHQ, by the way, is a preservative derived from petroleum and used in perfumes, resins, varnishes and oil field chemicals. Laboratory studies have linked TBHQ to stomach tumors. This preservative is also used by Chick-Fil-A  in their famous chicken sandwiches.Reviewing the ingredients in Pringles really got me worked up ever wonder why you cant stop eating chips after having just one? MSG is the culprit  and in the U.S. version of Pringles, its added twice! Once in its known name and again in a hidden source, called yeast extract.This begs the question Why are Americans so addicted to processed food?! The food industry has designed it that way on purpose to line their pockets with profits, at the expense of our health.The U.K. Ritz Crackers ingredient list resembles items that youd find in every household around the country  but the United States version goes the extra mile to include trans fat, HFCS and natural flavor. Natural flavor can be also be a hidden form of MSG, which, again, is an additive that will likely make you eat more than you would otherwise.In the United States, Quaker Oats has several different flavors of oatmeal that contain different fruit flavored, artificially dyed pieces of dehydrated apple but that dont actually contain any of the fruit shown on the package. But in the U.K.  they dont even attempt to sell that garbage. They instead have a product called Oats so Simple that actually has REAL strawberries in it  light years ahead of our version that includes trans fat, artificial food coloring, and artificial flavors.Theres only one difference in Rice Krispies between the U.S. and U.K. version  but its a big difference. Its one ingredient that is banned virtually in every other country, except here in the United States. That ingredient is called BHT (butylated hydroxytoluene) or BHA (butylated hydroxyanisole) and is a very common preservative used rampantly throughout packaged food in the U.S.Test studies published by the IPCS (International Program for Chemical Safety) show tissue inflammation, enlargement, and/or growths in 100%, and cancer in 35% of [animal] subjects as reported in this article. How can the U.S. allow this chemical in our food  much less in cereal aimed and targeted at our kids?And speaking of targeting our kids  food companies have found a way to naturally color candy all over Europe, but our candy here is still full of artificial substances made from petroleum and GMO sugar. Looking at the ingredients in Starburst Fruit Chews provides a great example of this disgrace.I saved the most startling fact for last. One very cautionary set of ingredients that are included in almost all of the American products but not the U.K. products are GMOs, in the form of either corn or soy.There have been no long term human studies on GMOs and preliminary studies on animals show horrific consequences. For instance, a study showed GMOs caused toxic and allergic reactions, sick, sterile, and dead livestock, and damage to virtually every organ studied in lab animals. Another study revealed that female rats fed GMO soy for 15 months showed significant health issues in their uterus and reproductive cycle, compared to rats fed organic soy or those raised without soy. A 2009 French Study concluded that Glyphosate (used on GMO soy) can kill the cells in the outer layer of the human placenta, the organ that connects the mother to her fetus, providing nutrients and oxygen and emptying waste products. A Russian study conducted on hamsters that were fed GMO soy diets for two years over three generations found that by the third generation, most of the hamsters lost the ability to have babies, showed slower growth, and suffered a higher mortality rate.In the U.K. food companies are required by law to list if a certain ingredient is derived from a genetically modified or genetically engineered material on the label. Out of all the products I researched, I couldnt find one product with this label. (See example from GMO-Compass and BBC above of what it would look like if I did.)This was very telling considering that not only have food companies taken out all sorts of hazardous chemical ingredients abroad  but they also have willingly reformulated their products without GMOs.Food corporations in the U.S. claim reformulating their products to remove harmful ingredients or changing labels would be too expensive  but theyve already done just that in Europe and in many other countries. Their governments listened to the outrage of their people and took the safety of their citizens health above everything else. Is it too much to ask the same for us in the United States of America? How much do our sickness, obesity, and mortality rates have to worsen before they respond to us?I will leave you with this note: is and I are very disturbed about the shameful hypocrisy allowed to happen with our food supply here in the U.S. In fact we are feeling very compelled to do something about it. Stay tuned, because we are going to need every one of you to help when we are ready.

Chipotle vs. Moe’s – What’s Really In That Food?,http://foodbabe.com/2012/08/14/chipotle-vs-moes-what-really-in-that-food/,"3/22 Update: Chipotle responded and agreed to release ingredients online in response to petition started after this blog post. Check out the latest and whats safe to eat at Chipotle hereand a news report here.Before I get into the meat of this next investigation (no pun intended), Id like to express my disappointment with Chipotle and Moes. Both of them made it extremely difficult (just like Yoforia) to get the exact ingredients in their product offerings. With marketing phrases like Food with Integrity and Feed the Moement  youd think their messages would easily be backed by ingredients they would be willing to share. Unfortunately, this is not the case at all and it took extreme perseverance to get quality information about their ingredients. Perseverance the average consumer would likely never have.Its saddening to watch two competitors leading the way in organic/local/healthy fast food offerings being so secretive. If they were true leaders, they would have nothing to hide, right? Im not saying Subway, Panera Breadand McDonalds are better than Chipotle or Moes  but you do have to hand it to them for willingly posting their ingredients for everyone to see.When I emailed Chipotle asking for the ingredients in certain products they downright refused. They in turn asked if I was concerned about a specific ingredient or had an allergy. Really? Why do I have to be concerned about a specific ingredient or have an allergy to want to know what I am eating and whats in my food? When I tried to call them, there was no way for me to leave a message or get a person on the phone to answer my questions. Email responses were S-L-O-W. I had to ask very specific questions to get the data I needed to write this  specific questions that most consumers would likely not ask. Thank goodness for the genuinely accommodating employee who shared some of the ingredients with me (behind his Managers back) so I could give you the full story.I had to call the headquarters of Moes every single day for 8 days, visit 2 different Moes, and call 5 different locations in different states to finally get the full story. Moes company does not provide their stores with an ingredient list of what they are serving, only an allergy info guide. Since the stores throw out the labeled boxes as soon as the food packages comes in, you would have no hope in knowing exactly what you are eating unless you call the headquarters and badger them until they finally concede.I can only assume Chipotle and Moes are betting that youll give up and continue to be acquiesced with their marketing messages that in many cases are misleading and in some cases inaccurate. Now that you know what it took to get this information, lets take a look at the results of the investigation.Both restaurants use cheap genetically modified (a.k.a. GMO)soybean oil to make most of their food. Over-consumption of this cheap oilis causing an imbalance of Omega 6 fatty acids, which increases the risk of inflammation, heart disease, obesity, and prostate and bone cancer.Chipotle and Moes both pride themselves that your meal can be customized, but when I asked if they could make my food without GMO oils, they couldnt. The chicken, beef, rice, beans and the tortillas (flour, corn and soft) are all not customizable, so you have no choice but to consume GMOs if you order these items. If you are a regular consumer of Chipotle and Moes because of their local, organic and healthy messages, you also need to be concerned about consuming GMOs. Heres why:Over 50 countries have significant restrictions or outright bans on GMOs, but here in the United States the FDA continues to not require safety standards or testing on GMOs. To date, there has been no long term study conducted for humans.The Institute of Responsible Technology reported a studyshowing GMOs causedtoxic and allergic reactions, sick, sterile, and dead livestock, and damage to virtually every organ studied in lab animals.After consuming GMOs, your intestines basically turn into a breeding ground for pesticides (heres a videoexplaining further). GMO soy and corn actually produce pesticides inside themselves. The plant becomes toxic inside so insects wont eat it.A studyconducted and published in the Anatomical Record revealed that female rats fed GMO soy for 15 months showed significant health issuesin their uterus and reproductive cycle, compared to rats fed organic soy or those raised without soy.A 2009 French Study concluded the key ingredient in GMO soy can kill the cellsin the outer layer of the human placenta, theorgan that connects the mother to her fetus, providing nutrients and oxygen and emptying waste products.A Russian study conducted on hamsters that were fed GMO soy diets for two years over three generation found that by the third generation,most of the hamsters lost the ability to have babies, showed slower growth, and suffered a higher mortality rate.Fertility issues in males were also observed when a study on male rabbits found a decrease in sexual activity and sperm concentrationand an increase in dead or abnormal sperm when they were fed GM soy.Please note  Since neither Chiptoles or Moes carries 100% Organic USDA certified label meat, the animals were all likely raised with GMO feed, which does get transferred to us when we consume it.I could really go on and on forever listing out the different studies about the potential health consequences and why you should be concerned about consuming GMOs. I would also like to note that you will likely encounter GMOs at any restaurant (or with any processed, packaged foods) unless it is 100% organic. If you want to learn even more  This PDFfrom the Institute of Responsible Technology is a great reference. And if you live in California  you must vote Yes to Prop 37this November to label GMOs. The outcome will likely affect all of us. So what else did I find? Heres a closer look at some of my other discoveries:Moes Grass-Fed Steak  This is where Moes really messes up. And it wouldnt be a stretch to say their No MSG label on their marketing is a big fat lie. They lace their prized grass-fed meat with 3 hidden sources of MSG  hydrolyzed soy protein, hydrolyzed corn and hydrolyzed yeast.The amount of MSG that restaurants can put in your food isnot regulated.MSG is an excitotoxin that if given in large enough doses canexcite brain cells to death.MSGcan cause adverse reactions in some people including skin rashes, itching, hives, nausea, vomiting, migraine headaches, asthma, heart irregularities, depression and even seizures.Moes Ground Beef Not organic, likely contains hormones and antibiotics, contains chemical preservatives and sweetened with corn syrup. I didnt know ground beef needed to be sweetened, yuck.Chipotles Pork Carnitas The only meat available to be made without GMO soybean oil.Chipotles & Moes Flour Tortillas  Made with enriched white flour and partially hydrogenated vegetable oils (a.k.a. trans fat). Previous trials have linked even a 40-calorie-per-day increase in trans fat intake to a 23% higher risk of heart disease. 40 calories is a mere 2% of a typical 2000 calorie per day diet. Trans fats can be deadly even in a small amount and as you can see will easily add up if you go over one serving size.Chipotles Corn Tacos (soft or hard) Containspreservatives andcellulose thats made from wood pulp.Cellulose is used as filler to processed foods because it doesnt contain calories or fat content and is cheap. Your body simply cannot use this ingredient at all nutritionally and lacks the enzymes to digest it. The thought of a company adding a cheap filler to my food to boost profits just doesnt sit well with me, and tortillas are easily made without it.Moes Whole Grain Tortilla  Contains many preservatives and colored with a potential carcinogen (caramel coloring) proven to causeliver tumors, lung tumors, and thyroid tumorsin rats and mice.Chipotles Roasted Chili-Corn Salsa, Tomatoes and Cilantro These are the only two guaranteed items at Chipotle that are GMO free.Moes El Guapo Salsa  Also colored with questionable caramel coloring. WOW. Why did they add color to the salsa? Because Moes salsa is a highly processed product that is mainly tomato concentrate, not real chopped tomatoes.Chipotles Cheese  Isnow 100% antibiotic and growth hormone free  but only 65% pastured raised.Moes Queso  Processed cheese product that is not from naturally raised animals. Contains propylene glycol, apetroleum based chemical food additive. Its the same stuff you can find in antifreeze, and it has been reported that the following symptoms can arise after repeated small doses  throat irritation, headache, backache, and kidney problems.Some Good News  Moes and Chipotle do not use microwaves nuking food to death or allowing it to sit out cold and be reheated again and again.VERDICT: Clearly, based on the overly processed nature of Moes products, Chipotle is the lesser of two evils, especially if you just stick to a salad with guacamole and salsa. For me  I am tired of always having to choose between the lesser of two evils and its going to be hard to support or trust either establishment until they man up and post their ingredients.If you are wondering how Im going to satisfy my burrito craving until then, check out a ridiculously fast 100% organic, non-GMO, and additive free recipe here.XOXO,Food Babe25.9K@media (min-width:980px) {#eop_optin_btn_container{margin-top:-20px;}}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-webkit-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-moz-placeholder { font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container ::-moz-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container :-ms-input-placeholder {font-size:20px;padding-top:5px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container {background-color:#28AAE1;margin:0px;}#eop_optin_subscribe_container .optin_msg{width:90%;text-align:center;border:none;border-top:1px dashed white;border-radius:0px;color:#FFF201;background-color:#28AAE1;font-size:26px;word-wrap:break-word;}.eop_header_txt{color:black;font-size:24px;line-height:24px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:10px;}.eop_h_divider{border-top:5px solid #ED297B;}.eop_main_txt{color:white;text-align:left;padding:10px;line-height:28px;font-size:25px;font-family:arial;}.eop_highlight{color:#FFF201; font-weight:normal;font-family:arial black;font-size:32px;}#eop_optin_btn{cursor:pointer;display:block;height:51px;width:51px;background:url(http://foodbabe.com/wp-content/plugins/foodbabe-eop-optin/img/social.png);background-position:-31px -50px;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;opacity:1;transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-moz-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;-webkit-transition:opacity .15s ease-in-out;}#eop_optin_btn:hover{ opacity:0.7;}.eop_input_field{height:24px !important;font-size:24px !important;font-family:monospace !important;}.eop_optin_input_n_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_dt{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_n_t{width:90%;}.eop_optin_input_e_t{width:90%;}#eop_optin_btn_container{padding:5px;}input#eop_optin_subscribe_fname_tb,input#eop_optin_subscribe_addr_tb {font-family:arial !important;}											Join the Food Babe Newsletter for Free!
