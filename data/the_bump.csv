"8 ', <b>Nutrition</b>, u' Tips for Plus-Size Pregnant Women",https://www.thebump.com/a/healthy-plus-size-pregnancy,"In general, overweight women should aim to gain between 15 and 25 pounds during pregnancy, while obese women should aim for 11 to 20. A plus-size pregnancy is a higher-risk pregnancy, so following weight-gain guidelines is that much more vital, says Margaret Wertheim, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Madison, Wisconsin. And keep in mind: Pregnancy isnt the time to start dieting. I definitely do not recommend pregnant women restrict themselves to the point of depriving their bodies or their babies of the calories they both need, Wertheim says. Instead, focus on eating nutrient-dense real foods emphasizing protein, healthy fats, vegetables, and fruit while limiting foods with added sugar. Read on for more tips on eating for two.Tip #1: Go lighter on the carbs.Overweight or obese women are more likely to have elevated blood sugar levels, which can lead to having a large baby, so Wertheim doesnt recommend consuming lots of carbs. Whats more, many carbohydrate-rich foods, like sweets, soft drinks, bread, pasta and chips, generally aren't super-rich in vitamins and minerals compared with beans, nuts, meats or veggies. But cutting them out altogether can lead to growth retardation, says Romy Block, MD, an endocrinologist who sees patients in a high-risk obstetrics clinic in Chicago. Stick to healthier sources of carbs, like fruit, dairy products and whole grains, which will give you and baby the nutrients you need.Tip #2: Slash your sugar intake.I always suggest that mommies-to-be reduce refined sugars and starches, says Julie Kabat Friedman, a health psychologist specializing in obesity and weight management and an assistant professor at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Were not saying you have to go cold turkeyyou can still have your treats. Just heed Friedmans advice to be mindful of portion size and make eating sweets a planned part of your day, instead of whenever you feel like it.  AdvertisementTip #3: Focus on lean protein.While youre cutting back on carbs and sugar, focus on filling your plate with more lean protein, like chicken breast, sirloin cuts of beef, beans, fish, tofu and low-fat dairy. Theres evidence that doing this helps prevent excessive pregnancy weight gain, decreases the risk of gestational diabetes and helps you feel more full, Friedman says.Tip #4: Try dividing your plate.Block suggests following this easy formula to get the right balance at every meal: Just divide your plate into quarters. Fill one quarter with lean protein, another with grains/complex carbs and fill the last two with veggies or a salad. Do this three times a day and youll have packed your day full of healthy nutrients, without overdoing it.Tip #5: Stick to a meal schedule.Stress eating can kick in for many pregnant women, especially in the third trimester when anxieties over big issues (delivery, child care, finances!) pop up. Friedman suggests creating a schedule that includes eating three meals and two snacks each day at a set time. Eating according to the clock helps prevent skipping a meal or overindulging, and it can help reduce emotional decision making about food. Need a few more ways to fight those stress-induced cravings? Try changing your environment (take a walk around the block or go run an errand) or distracting yourself with an enjoyable activity that doesnt involve food, like emailing a friend or browsing online for baby names.Tip #6: Check your prenatal vitamin for iodine.Getting enough folic acid and calcium during pregnancy is a no-brainer, but theres another necessary mineral you probably havent heard about. One especially important nutrient that has come to light recently is iodine, says Wertheim. Its essential for proper thyroid function and for baby's brain development, but about one-third of pregnant women in the United States are iodine-deficient. Check the label of your prenatal vitamin to see if it includes 150 microgams of iodine, and talk to your OB about the right dosage for your particular needs.  AdvertisementTip #7: Get those zzzs!Have you ever noticed its like a thousand percent harder to eat right when youre extra tired? Lack of sleep makes your body want to eat more, but then its too sleepy to burn off those extra calories, Friedman explains. Chances are heartburn, leg cramps or vivid dreams are going to disrupt your sleep at least some nights, but you can make sure you get the best rest possible by having a set wake and sleep time, and taking a hot shower before bed. Your body cools down after getting out of the hot shower, and that process has a relaxing, sleep-inducing effect, she says.Tip #8: Dont try too hard to be perfect.You and your body are going through a lot right now, and its important to be kind to yourself through this memorablebut stressfulexperience. Preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy has health benefits for both mom and baby; but the same goes for stress, says Friedman. If eating perfectly while pregnant is stressing you out too much, take a step back and dont beat yourself up if you have to give into the cravings once in a while. No mother should feel overly pressured about weight during pregnancy, Friedman says.Plus More From The BumpNutrition During PregnancyWeight-Control Tips for Plus-Sized Pregnancy6 Tricky Things About Your Plus-Sized PregnancyRelated Video"
10 Pregnancy Foods To Eat For Baby Kristin Koch,https://www.thebump.com/a/10-pregnancy-foods-to-eat-for-baby,"EggsWhat it's got: Whether you like them fried, scrambled, hard-boiled or served as an omelet, eggs are the gold standard for prenatal protein. They also happen to be a great source of folate, iron and choline.Why it's good for both of you: Not only are eggs a relatively cheap, versatile and convenient source of protein, but they contain choline too. Never heard of that last one? Choline is critical to fetal brain development and reduces the risk of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida. But to reap the benefits, you'll have to eat the whole thing (so forget the egg-whites-only order); choline is contained in the yolk. If your cravings are more for a burger than eggs Benedict, youre in luck  there's also choline in beef. Bonus: Give baby a brain boost by buying eggs fortified with omega-3s.Sweet PotatoesWhat it's got: Don't just save these guys for Thanksgiving  sweet potatoes are full of nutritious fiber, vitamin B6, potassium (even more than bananas have!), vitamin C and iron, as well as copper and beta-carotene.Why it's good for both of you: Sure, other foods on our list offer many of the same nutrients, but we're singling out sweet potatoes for their beta-carotene  an antioxidant that your body converts to vitamin A. And as you may recall, vitamin A plays an important role in the development of baby's eyes, bones and skin. Sweet potatoes are also a great way to meet your iron quota. Not only do these orange spuds contain iron, but they also have copper  a mineral that helps your body absorb iron. So swap in sweet potatoes for your usual sides; they're great mashed, baked or French-fried (um, yum!)  AdvertisementNutsWhat they've got: This crunchy (and convenient) snack is full of healthy fats (including those brain-boosting omega-3s we mentioned earlier), protein, fiber and a variety of vitamins and minerals. Plus, noshing on nuts will help make a dent in the 800 milligrams of magnesium you're supposed to get now that you're preggers.Why they're good for both of you: Munching on magnesium-rich foods helps reduce the risk of premature labor and aids in the development of your baby's nervous system. A quarter cup of almonds contains 98 milligrams of magnesium, so keep a stash in your purse for a convenient prenatal power snack on the go. Cravings control: If you feel like a bottomless pit these days, try noshing on shelled pistachios. They take longer to eat, giving your body more time to register that it's full.Beans and LentilsWhat they've got: If you're not a big meat eater (or one at all), beans and lentils are great sources of protein and iron, as well as folate, fiber and calcium. And beans (especially baked ones) are also bursting with zinc.Why they're good for both of you: Beans boast a bunch of the baby- and mom-friendly minerals found in animal products, so they're a great option for vegetarian and vegan moms-to-be. Beans are also rich in zinc  an essential mineral that's linked to a lower risk for preterm delivery, low birth weight and prolonged labor. Beans bother your stomach? Other great sources of zinc include meat, chicken, milk, fortified cereals, cashews, peas, crab and oysters (just don't eat them raw!).  AdvertisementLean MeatWhat it's got: Sure, you know it's a great source of protein, but lean beef and pork are also packed with iron and B vitamins.Why it's good for both of you: Your body needs a lot more protein now (about 25 extra grams a day) to help the fetus grow and to ensure his or her muscles develop properly. Same goes for iron: Not getting enough of this mineral can impair baby's growth and increase the risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight. Iron is important for mom, too  it's necessary for red blood cell formation (to prevent anemia). During pregnancy, your blood volume increases, so you'll need to up your iron intake (to around 27 milligrams a day). Bonus: Meat supplies a hefty dose of vitamins B6 (helps baby's tissue and brain growth, while easing mom's morning sickness) and B12 (helps to maintain healthy nerves and red blood cells).Orange JuiceWhat it's got: Down a glass in the morning to fill up on folate, potassium and, of course, vitamin C.Why it's good for both of you: You've probably heard a lot of buzz about folate and folic acid (the synthetic form that you get in supplements and fortified foods), and with good reason: It's a necessary nutrient for preventing certain birth defects early on in pregnancy and for ensuring a healthy pregnancy after that, so try to get about 600 micrograms a day. The potassium in OJ is important for keeping your muscle function, metabolism and overall health in check. Like iron, pregnant women need to consume more potassium, because of their expanding blood volume. And as you already know, orange juice is an excellent source of vitamin C, which, in addition to fighting colds, helps your body better absorb iron and keeps both your and baby's teeth and bones healthy.  AdvertisementYou can also get your vitamin C from broccoli, tomatoes, strawberries, red peppers and a variety of citrus fruits, including another prenatal power food  mangoes, which are packed with more than 20 different vitamins and minerals. Bonus: Opt for OJ that's fortified with vitamin D, which increases blood circulation in the placenta and aids in calcium absorption so that your baby will have stronger bones.YogurtWhat it's got: Surprise! Plain yogurt actually contains even more calcium than milk. Plus, it's got essential bone-building nutrients, including protein, B vitamins and zinc.Why it's good for both of you: Calcium is essential for keeping your bones and teeth healthy and helping baby to develop his or hers, and skimping on this key nutrient could put you both at risk. Expectant moms should get at least three servings of calcium a day to reduce the risk of low birth weight and preterm delivery. If your calcium count comes up short, your body will take the calcium baby needs from your bones, putting you at greater risk for osteoporosis later on. Bonus: Snack on Greek yogurt topped with fruit for double the protein (and fiber) punch.OatmealWhat it's got: Those oats are filled with fiber, protein and vitamin B6.Why it's good for both of you: Start your morning off right with a nice big bowl of oatmeal. Whole grains are great for keeping your energy levels up, especially if morning sickness has you feeling a bit drained. Plus, all that fiber will help with another pregnancy pleasantry: constipation. But the benefits don't just stop with mom. This convenient breakfast dish (yep, the instant kind is great too!) also contains protein and vitamin B6, both of which are important for baby's development. Bonus: Look for a variety that's fortified with iron, B vitamins and folic acid.  AdvertisementLeafy GreensWhat it's got: You had to know these guys were gonna make the list. Chock-full of antioxidants and nutrients, dark-green veggies  including spinach, asparagus, broccoli and kale  should really be on everyone's plates.Why it's good for both of you: These super foods are especially important for moms-to-be and developing babies. That's because, in addition to all those antioxidants, leafy greens supply calcium, potassium, fiber and folate, plus another important nutrient we haven't told you about yet: vitamin A. Because of its role in helping baby's eyesight develop and aiding in bone and skin growth, it's important for moms to nosh on vitamin A-filled foods too. No midnight cravings for asparagus or spinach? Oranges are also a great source.SalmonWhat it's got: This oily fish is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids and protein.Why it's good for both of you: Forget about preordering Baby Einstein DVDs  just incorporate salmon into your diet over the next nine months. The omega-3 fatty acids (aka DHA and EPA) in fish help baby's brain to develop, and higher levels of DHA in newborns have even been associated with higher IQs, advanced motor skills and fewer neurological problems later on. Omega-3s are good for the development of baby's eyes, too, and salmon is also a great source of lean protein for moms-to-be. Worried about seafood? Salmon's low in mercury and considered safe for expectant moms, but limit your intake to two servings of six ounces or less each week to be safe. Just not feeling fish right now? Snack on walnuts and almonds.

"Q&A: ', <b>Nutrition</b>, u' and getting pregnant?",http://www.thebump.com/a/nutrition-and-getting-pregnant,"There are a few good reasons to fine-tune your eating habits now. First, a balanced diet is linked to increased fertility. The healthier you and DH are, the better your chances of conceiving. Plus, eating wisely now will get your body in prime condition to have a healthy pregnancy once you conceive.So how do you start? Make sure to get several servings of fruits, veggies (especially leafy greens), whole grains and dairy every day. Cut back on refined sugar, white flour and saturated fat. You might also consider reducing your caffeine intake. Research on whether it affects fertility is mixed, but most docs say 200 mg (about one-to-two cups of coffee) a day or less is safe. A vitamin-mineral supplement is another good idea. Ask your doc for recommendations, because some contain things unsafe for baby (a prenatal vitamin is probably your best bet). Whatever you take, make sure it contains folic acid, calcium, iron, zinc, manganese, vitamin A, vitamin B6, and vitamin C.Related Video"

Professor Cristina Campoy, lead researcher for the project, described the need for a long-term study because shorter-term research seem ""unable to detect the real influence of nutrition in early life."" She added, ""NUTRIMENTHE was designed to be a long-term study, as the brain takes a long time to mature, and early deficiencies may have far-reaching effects. So, early nutrition is most important.""So far, they've examined the effect of B-vitamins, folic acid, breast milk (compared to formula), iron, iodine and omega-3 fatty acids on the cognitive, emotional and behavioral development of children from before birth up to age nine.Researchers have found that folic acid can reduce the likelihood of behavioral issues during early childhood. They've also found that oily fish is also very beneficial  not only for the omega-3 fatty acids but also for the iodine content  because it has a positive effect on a child's ability to read when measured at the age of nine. NUTRIMENTHE researchers also found that parental education level, socioeconomic status and age are all major influences on a child's mental performance because they influence how certain nutrients are processed and transferred during both pregnancy and if a mother breastfeeds.  AdvertisementCampoy said, ""It is important to try to have good nutrition during pregnancy and in the early life of the child and to include breastfeeding if possible, as such 'good nutrition' can have a positive effect on mental performance later in childhood. However,"" she said, ""in the case of genetics, future studies should include research on genetic variation in mothers and children so that the optimum advice can be given. This area is relatively new and will be challenging!""As the NUTRIMENTHE research is ongoing, the results of the most recent study will contribute to the scientific dietary recommendations for pregnant women and children in order to improve their mental performance.Looking to get the most out of your prenatal nutrients?:Foods With Calcium Foods With Folate Foods With IronFoods With Omega-3Foods With ProteinAm I Getting Enough Folic Acid?What's the Importance of Fiber?Do I Need More Iron Now That I'm Pregnant?Are Iron Supplements Safe for Pregnant Women?The Vegetarian Pregnancy: Am I Getting All the Nutrients I Need?Should I Eat More Fish?What Foods are Best to Brown Bag?Which foods help soothe your symptoms and keep you feeling great?:Foods to Eat to Ease Your Symptoms10 Superfoods for You (and Baby!)What to Eat When You're PregnantHow to Eat Right All Pregnancy LongHealthiest Foods for Moms-to-Be7 Awesome Meal Ideas for PregnancyWhich foods should you avoid?:Foods to Avoid When You're Pregnant10 Worst Foods for Pregnant WomenNot sure what to eat?

Best Foods For Baby (and What To Avoid) Erika Rasmusson Janes,https://www.thebump.com/a/best-foods-for-baby,"When it comes to feeding baby, theres no ""Top 10"" list of super foods for moms to print out, stick on the fridge and stick to. (Sorry!) But experts agree that limiting your little one to a few best foods in her first year (or any year, for that matter) would actually do her a disservice. ""The first year of life is when the palate is trained,"" says Tina Ruggiero, MS, RD, LD, coauthor of The Best Homemade Baby Food on the Planet. ""The three rules I tell my clients to follow are: Go for color, think fresh and introduce new flavors and different textures at age-appropriate stages. Following these guidelines, parents will find more than 10 fruits, more than 10 vegetables and more than 10 proteins to try."" And while you'll also want to talk with baby's pediatrician for guidance, adding the following great options to babys dietand avoiding a few first-year no-no foodswill get him or her off to a healthy start.Breast MilkWeve all heard (and heard, and heard) that breast is best. But just because baby is ready to move beyond the boob doesnt mean you should stop nursing. After all, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about six months. But the organization also recommends that breastfeeding continue along with solid fooods until baby is 12 months oldor longer, if it works for both mom and baby. The very best food for the first year is breast milk, says Loraine Stern, MD, FAAP, coauthor of the book Nutrition: What Every Parent Needs to Know.Best Age for Breast Milk: Birth and older  AdvertisementIron-Fortified CerealBaby is born with a natural supply of iron, but itll be depleted by the time shes around 6 months old, Stern says, so introducing iron-rich foods is essential. One that fits the bill: iron-fortified cereal. It doesnt have to be the traditional first food of rice cerealoatmeal and barley are good options toojust make sure you start with a single-grain formula.Best Age for Iron-Fortified Cereal: Four to six monthsAvocadosAvocados are a great first fruit to offer baby, because theyre loaded with monounsaturated fats (thats the good kind!) and have a mild taste and smooth consistency. Theyre super-easy to prepare too: Simply mash a very ripe avocado with a little breast milk or formula until it reaches a pureed consistency.Best Age for Avocados: Six months and olderSweet PotatoesOkay, so theres no baby super foodbut sweet potatoes come pretty close. According to The Best Homemade Baby Food on the Planet, theyre one of the most nutritious foods for baby. Why? Theyre rich in beta-carotene, which the body converts to vitamin Aand thats important for good vision, healthy skin, normal growth and protection from infections. Plus, many babies like the soft, pudding-like texture of pureed sweet potatoes, says Susan Casey, RD, CD, pediatric clinical dietitian at Seattle Children's Hospital.Best Age for Sweet Potatoes: Six months and olderMeatMeatlike chicken, lamb or beefis an excellent source of protein, as well as iron, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6 and zinc. Just make sure its pureed to a smooth texture. (According to Nutrition, for infants, even finely chopped meat may be hard to handle and cause choking.) Try mixing the pureed meat with breast milk and a favorite veggie puree if youre preparing it yourself, or buy plain pureed jarred meats.Best Age for Meat: 7 to 10 months and older  AdvertisementBeetsBeets are an extraordinary nutrient source, says Ruggiero. Theyre a good source of folic acid, high in potassium and beta-carotene, and theyre a sweet veggiewhich babies take a liking to quickly. Roast or steam them until theyre super-soft; then mash them.Best Age for Beets: 11 months and olderYogurtPlain (not vanilla) whole-milk yogurt is another protein-rich option for babyplus, it contains calcium and beneficial live active cultures. (Confused as to why yogurt made with cows milk is okay for babies, but actual cows milk isnt? Very simply, lactose is already broken down with the culturing of the yogurt, and milk proteins are either removed or limited, so its easy for baby to digest, says Ruggiero.)Best Age for Yogurt: Nine months and olderCheeriosBelieve it or not, many experts love good old-fashioned Cheerios. The little Os in the yellow box are an excellent finger food and a good source of fiber. I dont think childhood would exist without Cheerios, says Stern.Best Age for Cheerios: Nine months and olderA FEW FIRST YEAR NO-NOSHoneyTempted to sweeten up babys bland pear sauce with a touch of honey? Dont. According to Nutrition, Honey is linked to infant botulism, an illness that can be fatal. The tummies of babies under age one simply cant deactivate the botulism spores that might be in honey, Stern says. So avoid this food until baby has passed his or her first birthday.Nuts and PeanutsYou can introduce small amounts of creamynot chunkypeanut butter when your child is one year old (try spreading a thin layer on a cracker), but avoid nuts in whole form until he or she is 4 years old to prevent choking.  AdvertisementCows MilkBabies just cant easily digest cows milk, which is one reason why experts recommend waiting until the one-year mark before offering it.Plus, more from The Bump:Baby Food Taste Test: What the Littlest Critics LikedBaby Food Recipes for Every StageWhen to Start Solid FoodsPHOTO:ShutterstockRelated Video"

What To Eat While Pregnant With Twins And Triplets Excerpted from ...,http://www.thebump.com/a/what-to-eat-pregnant-twins-triplets,"If youre expecting twins, guidelines say you should consume 300 extra calories per day in the first trimester, 680 in the second trimester, and 900 in the third. If youre carrying triplets, eat 450 extra calories in the first trimester, 1,020 in the second trimester, and 1,350 in the third.

"Q&A: ', <b>Nutritional</b>, u' recommendations for a pregnancy with multiples?",https://www.thebump.com/a/nutritional-recommendations-for-a-pregnancy-with-multiples,"Yes. If youre carrying multiples, youre not only eating for two, but potentially three or four! That means youll need to gain more weight than usual to support a healthy pregnancy. Its generally recommended that moms expecting twinsgain 24 pounds by 24 weeks of pregnancy (it willreduce your chance of preterm labor). The American Pregnancy Association says women carrying twins are expected to gain 35 to 45 pounds during their pregnancy and moms carrying triplets should gain50 to 60 pounds. Also they recommend that moms-to-be of twins gain only four to six pounds during the first trimester and one and half pounds per week during the second andthird trimesters. If you're expecting triplets, you should gain one and half pounds per week throughout your entire pregnancy.Hopefully youll naturally have the appetite to support the weight gain, but here are some things to keep in mind that might help your nutritional intake keep up with your growing babies:-Eating small meals (about six) frequently throughout the day can help you consume more calories without feeling too full. Try snacking on nutrient-rich foods, like complex carbohydrates and nuts.-Incorporate foods into your diet that are high in protein and fiber. This includes leafy greens, grains, peanut butter, eggs, and oils. Like normal pregnancies, you should be careful around certain fish and processed meats. Red meat, if cooked properly, is great because its high in iron, which is also important throughout your pregnancy.-Consume a dairy product before bed each night to carry you over to breakfast the next morning.Have more questions? You can also ask your MD about referring you to a professional dietician to help you meet your daily nutritional needs.Related Video"
Breastfeeding Diet: Tips For New Moms,https://www.thebump.com/a/breastfeeding-diet-1,"Sure, youve heard breast is best. But have you ever thought about how the food you eat while breastfeeding affects baby? And what about getting rid of the baby weight? Can you diet while still safely nourishing your newborn? Well, were here to help you get to the bottom of all your post-pregnancy diet concerns. To start, theres good news for your evolving body: Making all that milk means youre burning about 500 calories a day if youre exclusively breastfeeding. Thats the equivalent of running about five miles at a good clipexcept you can do it from the comfort of your chair while snuggling up with baby! And even better, it doesnt have to be all or nothing. If youre supplementing with formula, youll still burn through about 300 extra calories a day, says Jessica Cording, a registered dietitian who works with new moms in her New York City practice.And though it may not feel like it right now, thanks to breastfeeding, you can (and likely will) lose weight. You do naturally when youre breastfeeding, Cording says. Its helping the uterus shrink down, your metabolism is firing, and it happens without even having to obsess over calories. If youre anxious to slip back into those pre-pregnancy jeans, its fine to start watching what you eat. Just beware of overly restrictive diets that sap your energy and, worse, might even mess with your ability to produce the milk baby needs. In one study, women were able to eat as few as 1,500 calories a day without impacting their milk output, but once they dipped below that number their production shrank by 15 percent. I generally encourage moms to take it slow and steady, Cording says. Sometimes if were being overly restrictive with our calorie intake, youre missing out on important nutrients that mom and baby really need.  AdvertisementBreastfeeding super nutrients you need nowGenerally youll need about 500 calories more per day to make up for what you burn while breastfeeding, but the best diet for breastfeeding doesnt just require more calories. Since you now have to share all the vitamins and minerals you eat with baby, maximizing nutrition is the name of the game. Here are the key nutrients youll want to incorporate into your daily meals.ProteinYou need about 15 more grams of protein than you did before you were pregnant, Cording says. Try this breastfeeding diet tip so you know youre getting enough: Take your weight, cut it in half and add 15. Thats about how many grams of protein you should aim for each day. Or a simpler strategy is just to include some protein in every meal or snack.CarbohydratesNows not the time to go low-carb, Cording says, especially if youre short on sleep. Your energy levels and hormones are in a state of flux, and making sure you have some carbohydrates for your body to work with will help you stay more energized. Youll need about 210 grams a day, or about 60 percent more than before you were pregnant. So make sure your breastfeeding diet includes some type of healthy carbit could be a fruit, whole grain, veggies, pasta or dairy productat each meal or snack. And as you probably already know, skip the white carbs and do your best to reach for healthy, higher-fiber carbs thatll keep you full longer and pack an extra-nutritious punch.Folic acidYou already know how important folic acid is during pregnancy, but its just as important for your postpartum diet too. Your baby is still developing, so those same things are still very important, Cording says. Breastfeeding moms should aim for .5 mgs per day. A great source: greens like spinach and kale. Its kind of a clich, but these leafy greens are good for just about everything, Cording says. Youll also find it in fortified breads and pastas as well as oranges and sesame seeds.  AdvertisementOmega-3 fatty acidsWe often immediately think of fish for omega-3s, which are important for babys brain developmentbut theyre hardly your only source. You can also find these healthy fats in grass-fed beef and dairy, chia seeds, walnuts and free-range eggs. Shoot for 200 to 300 mg of omega-3s per day, or the amount in one to two servings of fish a week. (Just steer clear of high-mercury seafoodsee below for more details).CalciumWhile you dont actually need more calcium while youre breastfeeding, its important that you fill your quota of about 1,000 mg. Its normal to lose about 3 to 5 percent of your bone mass during breastfeeding (dont worry, it comes back after you wean), but you want to make sure your bones dont take a bigger hit than they need to. Luckily, unlike baby, youve got plenty more options to pick from than milk. Add salmon, sardines (or any fish with little bones in it), broccoli, bok choy and tofu to your breastfeeding diet meal plan.IronMost women dont need extra iron while breastfeeding, but if you lost blood during your delivery or after, you might. Check with your doctor to see how much daily iron he or she recommends. Red meat is the easiest way to get your fill, but vegans and vegetarians have options too. Dried beans, peas and (again) dark leafy greens will all help you get the iron you need with or without meat on the menu.Breastfeeding foods to put on your watch listNow that youve safely ushered baby into the world, there are fewer no-nos when it comes to what you can eat. So, can you eat sushi while youre breastfeeding? Yep! If youve been craving your weekly fix these past nine months, go ahead and put it back on your breastfeeding diet menu. But dont forget that what you eat and drink still gets filtered through to baby, so there are some foods to avoid or limit while breastfeeding.   AdvertisementAlcoholOkay, so after nine months of just saying no, you're probably wondering what the word is on your postpartum drink order. Like so many things about raising babies, the amount of alcohol thats safe for baby is up for debate. A small percentage of the alcohol you drink does go into your breast milk. And just as your body naturally metabolizes alcohol from your bloodstream, it will also clear from your breast milk after about two to three hours per serving. While some women believe they can just pump and dump to help remove alcohol from their breast milk after having a drink, this is actually a myth. Only time gets rid of the tainted milk. As expected, there are lots of opinions on the topic. While some experts recommend being a teetotalerwhen it comes to baby you never can be too safeothers find that approach to be overly strict. After all, the amount of alcohol that makes it into your breast milk is equivalent to about 5 to 6 percent of the strength, relative to baby's size, and drinking small amounts hasnt been shown to be harmful. If you do decide to drink up, the experts agree on one thing: Make it two drinks or less, and always wait those allotted number of hours before you nurse or pump. The bigger risk with drinking is likely caring for baby safely, so make sure if you do indulge in a little happy hour fun, someone else is available to help. And never share a bed with baby after drinking.  AdvertisementCaffeineIf, say, caffeine is your must-have to function like a human, the rules are much more liberal. Thats right, it is safe to drink coffee while breastfeeding. Woot! Less than one percent of the caffeine in your venti latte makes it into your breast milk, so as much as three eight-ounce cups (about 750 mg of caffeine), spread throughout the day, is considered safe for you and baby. Keep in mind some babies are sensitive to caffeine, though, so if you find babys especially fussy, jittery or prone to waking up more than usual, try decreasing your intake of caffeinated drinks and foods (yep, that means chocolate too) and see if that makes a difference.High-mercury seafoodFish is a great food to include in your dietin fact the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfeeding moms eat it once or twice a week. But both pregnant and breastfeeding moms should steer clear of seafood thats high in mercury, like shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish. Your best bet with all fish, Cording says, is to mix it up: Have your tuna salad (canned albacore is higher in mercury) once or twice a week, but go for salmon (which tends to be lower in mercury) another day.Making milk: How to pump up your outputStruggling with supply? Nursing (or pumping) frequently is the best way to make sure you keep up your milk. But if youre looking for alternative ways to try and boost supply, certain breastfeeding foods are rumored to help with milk production. Even though theres little hard evidence that they really work, it cant hurt to tryespecially if lactation cookies are on the menu, right?  AdvertisementOatmealDoesnt matter how you eat this breakfast of championsslow cooked, quick or even baked into cookiesoatmeal is a smart go-to for milk-making moms. I recommend finding ways to add it to non-breakfast things too, Cording says. Put it into meatballs instead of breadcrumbs. Or stir it into yogurt. It helps with supply and keeps your energy levels consistent. No research has proven it works, but oats pack protein, fiber and iron, which are all part of a healthy breastfeeding diet, so eat up.Lactation cookiesDid someone mention cookies? Thats rightthere are plenty of recipes for cookies that may help to promote milk supply. The magic ingredients vary, but tend to include things like oatmeal, wheat germ (a source of zinc, which may help heal cracked nipples) and flaxseed (good for omega-3s). Just remember, cookies are still cookies.GarlicIt doesnt just linger on your breathgarlic also changes the flavor of your breast milk. And that could be the reason why women have claimed for centuries that garlic is a milk booster. New research suggests that when baby gets a taste of that unexpected and new flavor, it may cause her to suckle more, which in turn helps boost your supply. Herbal teaCertain herbs are commonly said to help with milk supply, including fenugreek, blessed thistle and fennel seed (you can also eat fennel for a similar effect). Packaged teas designed for nursing mothers are likely to contain these herbs and others. If you want to try one of them, youll get an added bonus: Drinking herbal tea will help you stay hydrated, since getting enough water is also key for milk production. Just keep in mind that most herbs havent been extensively studied, especially when it comes to breastfeeding, so sip with caution and moderation, and check with your doctor if you have concerns.  AdvertisementCarrotsThese beta-carotene powerhouses are rumored to help with milk production, whether you crunch the sticks or drink them juiced. Plus, you could be setting baby up to be a lifelong veggie eater: One study found that when breastfeeding moms ate carrots regularly, their babies were more receptive to the taste later on.WaterJust like during pregnancy, youll want to keep a water bottle within reach and drink up. Two to three liters a day (8 to 12 cups) is helpful for breastfeeding moms to offset the fluid going into the milk you make, Cording says. But chances are you may feel thirsty all the time anyway, so it probably wont be too hard to get your daily requirements.Do I need to take supplements when breastfeeding?A healthy, well-balanced diet is all you really need to cover your nutritional bases when youre breastfeeding, especially if you include meat and fish in your diet. Still, many experts do recommend sticking with your prenatal vitamin while breastfeeding anyway. These are some of the reasons why you might want or even need to supplement your post-pregnancy diet as long as youre feeding baby.For your bonesCalcium, as well as the vitamin D that helps you to absorb it, is a must-have for nursing moms since both pregnancy and nursing temporarily decrease your bone mass (even though extra calcium cant actually prevent the bone loss).For your bloodThe whole no-periods perk of pregnancy and (early) breastfeeding means youre probably at less risk of anemia (low iron) now. But if you lost a lot of blood during or after your delivery, your doctor or midwife might recommend an iron supplement to help replenish that loss.  AdvertisementFor babys brainThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends getting 200 to 300 mg a day of omega-3 fatty acids. If you dont serve up seafood at least once a week, a supplement can help your daily numbers stay on track. Allergic to fish? You can opt for a plant-derived vegetarian supplement. For vegans and vegetariansIf meat, chicken, fish and/or dairy products are off the table, youll need a supplement with vitamin B12 in it. Moms who are vegan may be short on this vitamin, which can lead to low milk supply. Luckily, most over-the-counter multivitamins have it, and its also in fortified foods like breakfast cereal, some nutritional yeasts, meat substitutes and milk substitutes.Do certain foods make baby gassy or colicky?When babys fussy or has colic, its natural to (desperately!) look for a fix. The truth is, every baby is different. If hes otherwise healthy, well fed and gaining weight, some research suggests proteins in your milk (typically from the cows milk you drink) could be the culprit. If youre breastfeeding a gassy or colicky baby, try giving up dairy for a week to 10 days to see if it helps. But if you cant imagine your morning without a bowl of cereal and milk, take note: Cows milk sensitivity is estimated to only happen with about .5 to 1 percent of babies.Other research has taken a bigger picture look at moms menus. Along with cows milk, foods including cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, onion and chocolate were more common in the diets of breastfeeding moms whose babies had belly pain, were irritable and cried a lot. And it makes sense. Many of these trigger foods can lead to gas and bloated bellies in adults, so think what they might do to babys tiny developing GI track.   AdvertisementIn one other study, moms went on a low-allergen (that means no dairy, soy, wheat, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts or fish) breastfeeding diet and it turned out after a week, their colicky babies cried 90 minutes less per day compared with babies of breastfeeding moms who ate their normal dietsincluding peanuts, chocolate, soy and milk every day.How to tell if your breastfeeding baby has an allergyFirst off: If youre worried baby has an allergy, the odds are she probably doesnt. In fact, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only 2 to 3 percent of exclusively breastfed babies have an allergic reaction. Cows milk protein is usually the culprit, but egg, corn, and soy were other common offenders in one large study. If you (and baby) happen to be the unlucky ones, youre most likely going to see that allergy in the form of a skin rash like eczema or a gastrointestinal symptom like blood in her diapers.One of the simplest ways to figure out if one (or more) of the foods on your breastfeeding diet is bothering baby is to systematically eliminate suspected offenders from your plate. Experts recommend cutting one food at a time, starting with the most likely: cows milk. Then wait at least two weeks (though often youll see a change in as little as a few days) before moving on to another food. Dont see a difference? You can add that food back and try cutting out the next one on your list (like soy, citrus fruits, eggs, nuts, peanuts, wheat, corn, strawberries or chocolate) until youve found the offender.   AdvertisementHow to prevent baby from getting food allergiesYou may be tempted to try and ward off allergies by avoiding foods like milk or nuts, but sorry to say theres little to no evidence that worksand it could even backfire, according to some research. Unless youre dealing with an existing food sensitivity, go nuts: Theres no evidence that restricting your own diet will have any effect on babys chances of eating peanut butter without issue.When it comes time to move beyond milk, the rules are also pretty liberal. Between 4 and 6 months, when you and your doctor decide its time for solids, the skys the limit as far as what single-ingredient foods you can introduce to baby. While its a good idea to start with things like fruits, vegetables and grains, as soon as youre past these less-allergenic menu items, its fine to try adding egg, dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish. And new research suggests that starting these foods sooner rather than later might even help decrease the risk of allergies. Yes, you read that right. There has been very real and substantial evidence and recommendations about introducing allergenic foods earlier are changing worldwide. The most major original trial was published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, and as of summer 2015, the AAP accepted and endorsed the recommendations. Plus, a whole host of other organizations, including the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, the World Allergy Organization, the Society for Pediatric Dermatology, and the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, all now support early introduction of allergenic foods.   AdvertisementFeeling overwhelmed? Dont. Yes, breastfeeding nutrition is important, but try not to drive yourself crazy. As long as youre breastfeeding, you feel good, your baby is growing well and everybody is getting along, thats the important thing, Cording says. PHOTO:iStockRelated Video"
"Four Simple Steps to a Greener Pantry - Pregnancy - ', <b>Nutrition</b>, u' ...",https://www.thebump.com/a/four-simple-steps-to-a-greener-pantry,"1. Out with the old, in with the green. Before you start stocking up on new items for your pantry, first things first: Start cleaning. Wipe down surfaces and use baking soda to absorb any lingering odors. Get familiar with nontoxic and eco-friendly cleaning lines, like Seventh Generation, Ecover, Method, or Mrs. Meyers Clean Day. Are you a bit of a pack rat? Check expiration dates and toss out anything you havent used in a while to save on space. 2. Spice it upPart of creating delicious meals is having a range of spices and herbs to choose from, so pick some fresh herbs at your local farmers market or grocery and use them to season your dishes whenever possible. Whatever you dont use, dry out and save for later in a glass container. Spices tend to go stale after a few months, so the key is purchasing them in small amounts so you maintain the freshness and save a buck or two while youre at it. Must-have herbs for pregnancy include: - Ginger: For morning sickness - Peppermint: For morning sickness and gas- Garlic: For boosting the immune system3. Stock up on grains Time to toss the processed, refined grain products and start embracing whole grains. White products (like white flour, white rice, pasta, and white bread) convert into simple sugars within 15 minutes of eating them, which can wreak havoc on your blood sugar levels. Foods made of whole grains are a much better option, since theyre loaded with B and E vitamins, magnesium, iron, and, of course, fiber.  AdvertisementMust-have grains include: - Whole oats- Brown rice - Barley - Whole-wheat products (i.e., bread, pasta, etc.)- Wild rice - Quinoa - Millet4. Rediscover your sweet toothNewsflash: Processed sugars are out; natural sweeteners are in. So let go of the refined white sugar and artificial sweeteners and try some natural sweeteners that are widely available, like raw agave nectar, stevia, date sugar, palm sugar, honey, and maple syrup. If you decide to cut back on sweeteners but still want to experience the sweet taste, try incorporating sweet-tasting foods, like sweet potatoes, roasted squash, or cinnamon.Latham ThomasRelated Video"
Q&A: Will My Unhealthy Diet Affect My Baby?,https://www.thebump.com/a/will-unhealthy-diet-affect-baby,"Mothers all around the world produce very ample milk on very inadequate diets. You don't need to eat perfectly when you breastfeed. The best rule of thumb is to eat to hunger. Most moms find that they gradually lose the extra weight they gained during pregnancy that way. Rather than eating the extra calories needed for milk production, they use their fat stores (what a concept.). Still, a healthy diet will increase your energy, help your immune system, and give baby a great example for making healthy food choices as she grows.Related Video"

"Q&A: Eating Right During Pregnancy? Denise Gershwin, CNM ...",http://www.thebump.com/a/eating-right-during-pregnancy,"Good nutrition during pregnancy is essential the nutrients you give your body are the building blocks of strong, healthy growth for baby. During the next nine months, you'll need about 300 more calories perday than usual. The best way to get these in is by sneaking in two or three healthy snacks between three small meals. Eating frequent small meals (as opposed to a few large meals separated by long period without calories or nutrients) help baby get maximum benefit from what you eat. Here are a few more ways to give baby a healthy start (and keep yourself comfortable):[] Drink eight to ten glasses (80-100 oz) of water each day[] Pick fruits, vegetables and whole grains, which are healthy and prevent constipation[] Eat high iron foods such as liver, shellfish,lean meat, poultry, fish, dried beans, green leafy vegetables and whole graincereals and breads[] Choose whole grains over sugar cereals and whitebread[ ] Avoid excessive caffeine (found in most sodas, coffee,tea, chocolate)[] Don't skip meals  even if you don't feelhungry, baby needs the nourishment[] Use our prenatal nutrition checklist to keep track of food groups and servings every dayRelated Video"
18 Healthy Pregnancy Snacks (All Around 300 Calories or Less!),https://www.thebump.com/a/healthy-low-calorie-snacks,
Eating for Two?,https://www.thebump.com/a/eating-for-two-top-pregnancy-misconceptions,"While you're probably aware that your diet affects your baby's development in utero and your newborn's health, many pregnant women still make eating errorsmainly because they don't know any better. ""Most women I see tend not to be aware of all the nutritional requirements of pregnancy,"" maintains Kelli Hughes, R.D., a clinical nutritionist at the University of Virginia Health System in Charlottesville. ""But they'll happily do what is recommended once they know what to do.""Some of the common blunders expectant moms make could increase their risk of developing serious consequences like gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, or a bacterial infection that can be transmitted to the fetus. Avoiding these five dietary faux pas can mean better health for both of you.Mistake 1: Eating for twoEvery expert we spoke to listed this as the numero-uno diet gaffe. ""There is a common belief that pregnancy is the time for indulgence,"" says Raul Artal, M.D., chairman of the department of obstetrics, gynecology and women's health at St. Louis University School of Medicine. ""It's a myth.""Not only can overeating make it harder to lose the excess weight after delivery, but you're also at increased risk during pregnancy for gestational diabetes and high blood pressure, which is a symptom of preeclampsia. ""If you develop preeclampsia, there is a higher risk for poor fetal growth and a complicated delivery,"" Artal says. ""Gestational diabetes leads to bigger babies and a higher C-section rate.""During your first trimester, you don't need any additional calories; in the second trimester, you need 340 more each day; in the third, 450 more. However, the U.S. Department of Agriculture recommends that pregnant women consume 71 grams of protein per day. (Nuts, eggs and lean meats are quick, easy options.) ""You need the extra protein to support new cell growth in the fetus,"" says Jennifer Ramos Galluzzi, Ph.D., assistant professor of nutrition and science at Housatonic Community College in Bridgeport, Conn.  AdvertisementSolution: The number of extra calories you require is small compared with the amount of extra nutrients. So get your additional calories from high-nutrient foods: fruits, vegetables, nuts, beans, legumes, low-fat dairy products and lean meats. All of these give you lots of nutritional bang for your calorie buck.Mistake 2: Obsessing about weight gainWhile some women take in too many calories, others consume too few. Big mistake. ""Some women are terrified of gaining weight and scared it won't come off afterward, so they restrict their diets,"" says Heather Blazier, R.D., L.D., a clinical dietitian at the Medical College of Georgia in Augusta. Complications of eating too few calories can include low birth weight. ""I see women who think milk products are high in fat and calories, so they avoid them,"" Blazier adds. ""If you don't get 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily, the baby's skeleton will be built with calcium leached from your bones.""Solution: Don't deprive yourself of necessary nutrients during pregnancy, as your fetus will not get what it needs for healthy growth and development. If you are obese, consult a dietitian who specializes in pregnancy nutrition to determine the proper prenatal diet for you. Also, cut out all nutritionally empty calories, such as snack foods.Mistake 3: Feeling tired & stressedWhy, you may wonder, are psychosocial factors considered nutritional mistakes? Because studies show they have a negative impact on your diet. ""Overtired, fatigued women tended to eat more empty-calorie carbohydrates like candy and cookies, the kind that provide quick energy but lead to a decrease in important nutrients like folate and vitamin C,"" says Laura Caulfield, Ph.D., an associate professor at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health's Center for Human Nutrition in Baltimore, referring to a recent study she co-authored that examined how stress affects diet during pregnancy. ""And they ate fewer vegetables, fruits, beansthe nutrient-dense foods that pregnant women should choose.""  AdvertisementSolution: Pay as much attention to your emotional well-being as to your physical health. Stress and weariness lead to poor food choices, so get enough sleep and discuss with your doctor any anxiety you're experiencing.Mistake 4: Skipping breakfastExperts advise that pregnant women eat three small meals and two snacks at regular intervalsevery three to four hoursto help maintain steady blood glucose (sugar) levels. But many women habitually eschew the morning meal, and continue to do so even when expecting. ""By morning you've gone eight to 12 hours without food, so you need to eat,"" Caulfield says. ""Skipping breakfast and [other] meals increases the risk of premature labor.""Without a healthy morning meal, you also may feel sick to your stomach, lightheaded and, soon, famished. But what if you already have morning sickness? ""Many times, keeping something in the stomach can help ward off morning sickness,"" Blazier says. Soon after getting up, eat just a little of whatever you can tolerate, such as rice or rice cakes, toast or saltine crackers. If you can't keep down anything at all, don't give up. ""Try to eat a very small amount every two hours,"" Blazier advises. ""Some women may have to live on rice for a couple of weeks if that is all they're able to handle."" And be sure to drink plenty of water to avoid dehydration.Other nausea soothers include citrus, ginger, mint and watermelon. Choose foods with those ingredients; even just sniffing a lemon or sprig of fresh mint may do the trick. Or try this simple, refreshing recipe for watermelon pops (even better if you can get someone to make them for you!): Puree 4 cups of frozen, seedless, cubed watermelon and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice in a blender. Strain the pure through a fine-mesh sieve, then pour it into popsicle molds, small paper cups or an ice cube tray. Freeze and enjoy.  AdvertisementSolution: If you've never been a breakfast eater, start with yogurt and a banana; then add whole grains and lean protein a few weeks later.Mistake 5: Eating unsafe foodsYou're at higher risk for food-borne illnesses now, because a woman's immune system is suppressed when she's pregnant. Listeriosis, a serious food-borne bacterial infection, is particularly dangerous during pregnancy. ""This infection can cause miscarriage, stillbirth or severe brain infections in fetuses and newborns,"" says Jennifer Galuzzi, Ph.D. ""Pregnant women may think it's OK to have a hot dog or undercooked meat 'just this once,' but that's all it takes if the food is contaminated.""Solution: Avoid eating raw or undercooked meats and fish (that includes sushi), Mexican soft cheeses and varieties such as Brie and Camembert, deli meats, hot dogs, and unpasteurized milk products or juices. In addition, adopt safe food-handling practices, which include washing your hands after touching uncooked meats and using separate cutting boards, plates and knives for meats and produce.Nancy Gottesman for Fit Pregnancy.

Dad glow extends beyond dirty diapers and late night feedings when mom is catching up on zzz.Here are 7 ways you can feel more involved and increase your paternal satisfaction  and glow like mama does.Skin to skin Baby is happiest when connecting skin-to-skin with mom or dad. His temperature, heart, and breathing rates will be more consistent, and his blood sugar more stable. It also allows baby to get familiar with your scent and your heartbeat becomes a soothing beat for the little one. Spend time bonding, lounge around in your boxers and let baby rest on your chest while you're watching TV (just be sure it's not the playoffs  you don't want to startle the baby!).Play games Make silly faces, play peek-a-boo, sing songs, for baby. Set aside regular time for baby, whether it's after work or in the morning. Appoint a special time that's just for you and the little one, so as baby grows, this special bonding time becomes part of the daily routine.Glow time Glow time is an important concept that I introduce through my book, Mama Glow: A Hip Guide to Your Fabulous Abundant Pregnancy. It's all about taking personal time to lavish yourself and shine! While mom is taking some alone time to shine and do what she loves, you can have glow time with your baby. This could be a bath time ritual where you shut off phones and dim the lights and enjoy a nice soak with baby, or baby massage using a nice jojoba oil or calendula baby cream to rub your little one with soothing hands- relaxing baby and preparing for bedtime so you and mom can have some glow time of your own. Or hit the streets a nice walk outside or a mild hike with baby in a carrier, babies love the stimulation of being outside in the comfort of your arms.  AdvertisementTake charge Mom may like things done a certain way and may even school you on how to handle certain tasks when it comes to baby like how to warm a bottle, change a diaper, comfort your baby, etc. But you will develop your own way of doing these things. Rather than let mom step in and ""correct you"" and show you repeatedly how to do it her way, just keep practicing and you will learn your own technique and shortcuts for newborn care. Communicating that you are fine with handling baby and taking the initiative without having to be asked is always great too. It gives you more one-on-one time with baby too.Slay your checklists Mom will have a list of things that need to get done and feel overwhelmed at the thought of trying to get through the list. Ask her to delegate some of those tasks to you so you can complete them. Men like to ""fix"" things and get things done, be productive, etc. When you are able to satisfy her needs and help reduce her stress load by checking off some of her to-do-list she will be thrilled- and when mom is happy, everyone is happy. This also satisfies your desire to feel needed, believe me, she needs and wants you around, although she may be madly in love with a new man who's 7 pounds 11 ounces and 20 inches long.Keep it movin' Babies are used to movement because of moms' hips moving when they were still in the womb. They feel soothed by movement and grow to have fun with it as well. Whether you're doing baby bench presses with your infant, or daddy dance party getting baby to giggle while you're moving him around is great. Movement also helps increase baby's muscle tone, and trains baby's proprioceptors  his sense of self in relation to space.  AdvertisementFind dad posse Find other cool dads who share a similar philosophy, have kids the same age or just provide a listening ear. You may just need to bond with other men who are going through what you are. Having a sense of community and knowing that you are not alone is key. Being a new father can be an isolating experience but certainly doesn't have to be.Whether you are a new dad or a veteran in the baby game, it's always good to learn some new tips to sharpen your skills, build your confidence, and boost your bond with baby.Related Video"

Diabetes diet and exercise?,https://www.thebump.com/a/diabetes-nutrition-exercise,"Coming into pregnancy as a diabetic is no easy task, and its important to make sure youre getting the appropriate high-risk care as well as paying attention to diet and exercise. If you have type 2 diabetes, what and how often you eat will have a bigger effect on your health. Focus on having small, frequent and well-balanced meals, keeping an eye on your carbohydrate consumption. Aim for a minimum of 140 grams of carbs a day, or about 10 servings (a serving is about 15 grams; thats about the amount youd find in one slice of bread, half a banana, 1/3 cup of rice, half a cup of pasta, an apple, 2/3 cup of peas, a cup of broccoli, a small container of low-fat yogurt, or a cup of fat-free milk. Try to focus on whole grains (brown rice, whole wheat bread and pasta, etc.) instead of refined, and include plenty of fruits and veggies.If you have type 1 diabetes, its still important to eat a healthy diet, but note you may need to adjust your insulin levels, and you can expect your needs to increase as your pregnancy progresses. No matter what type of diabetes you have, its important to speak with a nutritionist, who can help you figure out a safe and nutritious diet that will be healthy for both you and your growing baby.Exercise is also important; type 2 diabetics who exercise regularly require far less medication than those who dont, and that still holds true during pregnancy. If youre not used to sweating it out on a regular basis, this isnt the time to start, but unless your doctor says otherwise, aim for at least 15 minutes of exercise once or twice day, ideally a low-impact exercise like brisk walking, swimming or cycling on a recumbent bike. Taking a walk after a meal, by the way, can help control your sugar levels.

Dig In! A Solid Food Starter Guide,https://www.thebump.com/a/baby-solid-food-guide,"THE BASICSWhen to beginWait until baby is at least four months old to start on the solid stuff. He needs to have reached certain developmental milestones like holding his head up, sitting up with support and overcoming the extrusion reflex, which causes them to spit out solids. Youll also want to get the okay from the pediatrician before you begin. She may recommend waiting until closer to six months to be sure your child is ready. Plus, a study published by American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that early introduction of solid food (before 17 weeks) may be linked to an increased risk of food allergies. The timing of babys first solid feeding will also depend on how well hes gaining weight on breast milk or formulaand whether he may need added iron and nutrients to his liquid diet. What to feedSo what should that exciting first taste of solid food be? For years, iron-fortified rice cereal, mixed with a generous helping of formula or breast milk, was the experts choice, but now both nutritionists and doctors say you can take your pick. The order of introducing foods is no longer rigidany order is fine, says Jennifer Shu, MD, pediatrician and coauthor of Food Fights. Im a fan of starting with a root vegetable such as carrot or sweet potato, because theyre naturally sweet and puree to a smooth texture, says Annabel Karmel, author of 40 recipe books and creator of the app Annabels Essential Guide to Feeding Your Baby & Toddler. No-cook purees such as mashed banana or avocado are also fantastic and are packed full of nutrients. Other popular first foods are pureed apples, pears, green beans, butternut squash, and oatmeal or barley cereal.  AdvertisementJust be careful about the consistency of babys food. Start small and thinyour baby is used to breast milk or formula, which is a liquid consistency, says Lara Field, MS, RD, CSP, LDN and founder of FEED, a pediatric nutrition counseling business. When transitioning to solids you dont want to risk her choking, so start off with more liquid-y foods that will easily run off the spoon.Once babys eating runny foods without any problem, you might want to introduce pureed beef or lamb (just be sure its very well pureed), which is high in that essential iron. For breastfed babies, introducing meat early has some advantages, since iron is better absorbed from meat than it is from fortified cereal, Shu says. How to do itStart without the spoonTo get baby used to the new flavors and textures, begin by dipping a clean finger into the puree and feeding her from your finger, which is softer, more familiar and less intrusive than a hard spoon.Dont expect baby to polish it all offBaby may eat only a tablespoon or two at a time for the first few weeks as she adjusts to new textures and tastes. Take it slow, Karmel advises. When you first start introducing baby to solids, its not about quantityits just about getting her used to the idea of food.Watch for signs shes doneBaby cant say shes full yet, so pay attention to her body language. If shes grabbing at the spoon, spitting out food or clamping her lips shut, shes probably trying to signal to you that shes stuffed.  AdvertisementBe ready for a messThere are bound to be spills, drips and splashes as you get the hang of feeding babyand baby gets the hang of eating. But dont let it stress you out. Keep washcloths or paper towels handy, and consider getting a wipe-clean drop cloth to lay down under the high chair to make cleanup a cinch.Keep trying foods baby rejectsIt may take several feedings before baby decides he actually does like pureed green beans, so keep trying. You can also mix a less-loved food in with a favorite to see if that helps entice him.What to watchIntroduce new foods carefullyGo slow. Introduce something new every few days. That way, if your child develops an allergic reaction, it will be easier to find the cause.Beware of a bad reactionIf baby develops a rash, vomiting, diarrhea or severe gas, it may be a sign of a food intolerance or allergy. Stop giving him the food immediately and call his pediatrician.Hold off on milk and honeyMany babies have a hard time digesting cows milk, and honey carries a risk of infant botulism. if given to baby, so hold off until after the first birthday. (Other dairy products, such as yogurt and cheese, are fine after nine months though, because the lactose in them has been broken down.)Dont freak about allergiesUnless you or your partner have severe food allergies, its okay to feed baby common allergens like wheat, shellfish, fish and soy. Just watch closely the first few times for signs of reaction.  AdvertisementPREP FOR MEALSBuy baby foodStore-bought baby food may get a bad rap, but there are actually some healthy options available. See how to suss out the right ones for baby.Count the ingredientsAs you read labels, remember the fewer ingredients on the list, the betterideally, the only thing applesauce should have in it is apples. Jarred baby foods may need a few preservatives to pro-long shelf life, but if you see several unpronounceable chemicals, its a good idea to avoid it. You can also ask your pediatrician to recommend some brands to try.Check the protein levelsMany packaged meat baby foods actually have very little protein and iron in them, which means they wont have the nutrients baby needs. You might be better off cooking up and pureeing your own chicken and beef.Skip the salt and sugarBabies dont need salt or sugarand baby food shouldnt have them. Period. DIY baby foodMaking your own baby food is actually easier than it seemsjust blend up a few simple steamed veggies, fruits or well-cooked meats and youre in business. Its also a way to maintain more control over whats going into babys mouth, and may save you money over the pricey jarred foods. DIY-ing it may even help head off future picky eating (which toddlers are notorious for). The type of food in premade baby food is actually pretty limited compared with all the different fruits and vegetables available at the grocery store, says Bridget Swinney, MS, RD, LD and author of Baby Bites: Everything You Need to Know About Feeding Babies and Toddlers in One Handy Book. Leafy greens like kale, spinach and Swiss chard are rich in lutein, an antioxidant important for eye health. You dont see those vegetables in a jar. Infancy is a perfect time for babies to try many different foods to encourage them to eat a wide variety in the toddler years. Every week, introduce baby to new fruits and veggies.   AdvertisementReady to give DIY a shot? Keep these tips in mind:Start simpleWhile there are amazing baby-centric steam-and-puree systems out there (and many moms swear they make their lives easier), the pricey gadgets arent necessary for making baby food. Odds are you already have everything you need: a microwave or stove top to steam the foods and a blender, food mill or food processor to turn it into puree.Make big batchesYou dont have to cook fresh baby food every night. Instead, make large batches of a single type of puree and freeze it in smaller servingsuse ice cube trays for perfect one-ounce portions. Then, simply thaw out babys meal by placing it in the fridge and then warming it slightly on the stove. To change it up, you can mix and match purees every nighttry apple and banana puree one night and apple and chicken another. Carve out an hour over the weekend and make all of babys food for the entire week.Let baby have what youre havingIts okay to share your food with baby. She may not be ready for a bite of your curry or Buffalo wings, but if youre serving something simplesteamed broccoli, mashed potatoes, grilled chickenpuree some of it for baby to try. Just remember to season your meal after you have set aside a serving for babyspices (besides salt) are fine, but you might want to take it slow to watch for allergies.Step it up a notchOnce babys eating the basics, challenge his taste buds while giving him the nutrition he needs. Introduce healthy options, like pureed acorn squash or zucchini or anything else you find in the produce section. You never knowhe may love them for life.

The Vitamins You'll Need to Conceive,https://www.thebump.com/a/vitamins-you-need-to-conceive,"Ever wonder if theres something you should be getting more of now that youre trying to get pregnant? Well, there's actually a few things. According to Natalie Burger, MD, a fertility specialist at Texas Fertility Center, good nutrition can help you get pregnant and prep your body for baby. Here are the vitamins you should take:ZincNewsflash: You and your partner should be getting plenty of zinc. Zinc contributes to ovulation and fertility in women and also semen and testosterone production in men, according to the American Pregnancy Association. It has been noted that zinc deficiency can correlate with impaired sperm production, says Burger. The Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health recommends that men receive a daily intake of 11 mg of zinc and women take 8 mg. Oysters have more zinc per serving than any other food, but if the thought of those slimy shells don't appeal to you, you can also consume other zinc-rich foods like whole grains, crab and lobster, beans and dairy products.Folic acidThis one is a must-have. The American Pregnancy Association recommends that all women of childbearing age consume about 400 micrograms of folic acid a day. Folic acid is a B-complex vitamin that is used by the body to create red blood cells. This vitamin makes extra blood for your body during pregnancy and it decreases the possibility of aneural tube defect (a problem in babys spinal cord). Folic acid is the synthetic form of this vitamin, while folate is the naturally occurring form; both are okay to use. Since babys neural tube develops in the first few weeks of pregnancy, its important to be prepared. Both zinc and folate are important in the synthesis of DNA and RNA, says Burger. Zinc and folate supplementation may benefit some male infertility cases. You can get your daily intake of folic acid from citrus fruits, whole grains and leafy greens.  AdvertisementMultivitaminsIf youre already taking a multivitamin, youre in good shape. If youre not, start taking one now. In a large study following over 18,000 women who were trying to get pregnant, researchers found a correlation between taking a multivitamin supplement and having a lower chance of ovulation problems, says Burger.Coenzyme Q10Studies show that taking supplements of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) may help with both female and male infertility. Preliminary animal data has suggested that the addition of CoQ10 may improve egg quality in old mice, says Burger. The correlating human study is ongoing. There is also evidence that CoQ10 can increase sperm count. According to the Mayo Clinic, CoQ10 is produced by the body and is necessary for the basic functioning of cells. For adults, the recommended daily dosage is 30 - 200 mg in divided doses throughout the day.Omega 3 Free Fatty AcidTake this essential fatty acid found in fish oil or certain plant or nut oils if youre undergoing IVF treatments. Your body cant make omega 3 fatty acid; you have to get it through food. Increased omega 3 free fatty acid intake has been associated with improved embryo quality in an IVF study done in the Netherlands, says Burger.IronStart increasing the amount of iron in your diet now if you are not getting enough. Womens recommended iron intake is 18 mg a day, but pregnant women need around 27 mg daily. Iron is used to make hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells. If your body doesnt have enough iron, your bodys tissues and organs wont get the oxygen they need to function properly. You can normally get this amount in your multivitamin, but you can also find iron in foods like red meat, tofu and dark leafy green vegetables.  AdvertisementCalciumNutrition experts recommend that women looking to get pregnant should consume around 1,000 mg a day, because when you do become pregnant your growing baby will need calcium. Actually, its also recommended that all adults between ages 19 and 50 consume that amount of calcium in order to form strong bones and prevent osteoporosis. Thats a crazy amount  even for a multivitamin! You can take a separate calcium supplement or take an over-the-counter prenatal formula. Working calcium into your diet isnt a bad idea either: Drink lots of milk and eat leafy greens.Vitamin B6Take this vitamin now to head offnasty pregnancy symptoms after you conceive. Research suggests that women who consumed at least 10 mg of vitamin B6 before they conceived reported less morning sickness than those who didnt.Pass these to your partnerIn addition to zinc and CoQ10, guys who are trying to conceive can also take the following vitamins to boost their fertility:AntioxidantsTaking these supplements like vitamin C and vitamin E may help with fertility. In a small Spanish study comparing fertile and infertile men, a low intake of antioxidant nutrients was associated with poor semen quality, says Burger. You can take these vitamins in pill form or consume foods like oranges and strawberries (for vitamin C) and almonds and sunflower seeds (for vitamin E).L-carnitineIts a substance that serves as an energy source for sperm and it plays an important role in sperm maturation and metabolism, says Burger. The addition of L-carnitine may enhance sperm motility in some male factor infertility cases. You can get L-carnitine in supplement form.

"Can Baby Be A Vegetarian? Jennifer Mellick, MD Pediatrician",https://www.thebump.com/a/baby-vegetarian,"There are three main types of vegetarians (and a few sub-types)  all of them eat no meat.Lacto-ovo vegetarians: They dont eat animal flesh but do eat eggs and dairy products.Lacto vegetarians: They eat dairy products but no other animal products.Vegans:They eat no animal products  including honey and gelatin. Find out if a vegan diet is safe for baby here All vegetarians should plan their diets carefully so that theyre not deficient in certain vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D and iron.Its relatively easy for baby to be vegetarian when he starts eating solid foods, usually between four and six months old. Some signs that can help you know that babys ready to eat solids are: shes sitting up, she opens her mouth for a spoon and closes her lips over a spoon, shes able to let you know if shes full or hungry, she keeps her tongue low and flat when you put the spoon in her mouth, and shes showing an interest in food while others around her are eating. All vegetables and fruits can be pureed and given to a vegetarian. A vegetarian baby can get protein-rich foods from pureed tofu, cottage cheese, cheese, yogurt and egg products, and strained legumes (like beans, peas, chickpeas and lentils). He should get a variety of fruits and veggies  and stay away from unhealthy foods that could be considered vegetarian, like potato chips that are fried in canola oil, or soda. Feed baby iron-fortified cereal to prevent iron-deficiency anemia.  AdvertisementThe bottom line  a baby on breast milk or formula can get a good balance of nutrients on a vegetarian diet. Ensure baby is growing at a healthy rate with regular checkups with her pediatrician. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening all babies for iron deficiency between 6 and 12 months  whether theyre vegetarian or not. It is also recommended that all breastfed babies and formula-fed babies who receive less than 32 ounces of formula daily, receive a vitamin D supplement.When baby grows to toddler age, its important to monitor her nutrient intake because toddlers tend to be picky eaters. Recently, the AAP began recommending a 30-month well-child visit to keep tabs on picky eaters health. Most toddlers, especially vegetarians and vegans should be on a multivitamin that contains iron.Plus, more from The Bump:Can baby be vegan?Safe solids for babyBest foods for baby?Related Video"
Q&A: How much breast milk?,https://www.thebump.com/a/what-percentage-of-my-one-year-olds-diet-should-be-breast-milk,"It's great that you're continuing to offer your child the benefit of breast milk. Relax and rest assured that you can trust your (and baby's) instincts. If given the opportunity, most kids will eat when they are hungry and drink when they are thirsty. Simply continue to offer healthy solids throughout the day and breastfeed baby when he wants to nurse. The beauty of breastfeeding is that even if your son is going through a picky-eating stage, youll know he's getting excellent nutrition from your milk.There's no magic food-to-breast milk ratio, and every kid's needs are different. (Often, every day is different too.) If you are concerned that your child might not be gaining weight properly, head to the doctor for a weigh-in. He should stay close to his usual percentile on the growth charts. (Remember that growth percentiles are different for breastfed and formula-fed babies. Make sure your doctor has access to a growth chart for breastfed babies from the World Health Organization.)Related Video"
11 Things to Avoid When Trying to Conceive,https://www.thebump.com/a/what-to-avoid-when-trying-to-conceive,"SmokingYoure probably already planning onquitting smoking once you get pregnant (and you definitely should), but avoiding cigarettes now will be a huge benefit too. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, it takes longer for smokers to conceive, and smokingmakes a woman's eggs more prone to genetic abnormalities. Smoking increases the risk ofmiscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. In fact, the habit wreaks so much havoc on fertility that female smokers who have in vitro fertilization have to attempt it almost twice as many times as nonsmoking women doin order toconceive. Oh, and your partner should quit smoking too. Men who smoke cigarettes havelower sperm count and motility (swimming speed), and more sperm abnormalities.Too much caffeineRelax: You don't have to cut out your morning cup of joe. But if you consume more than 200 milligrams of caffeine  that's aboutone to two eight-ounce cups  per day, you should ease up. Heavy caffeine consumption has been associated with fertility problems. Plus, you won't want to overdo it during pregnancy (caffeineinterferes with your ability to absorb iron, can dehydrate you and, in highdoses,can increasemiscarriage andpreterm birth risk), so it's worth cutting back now.Binge drinkingSorry to break the news, but you should skip your friends' bar crawl while you're trying to conceive, or at least stick to sparkling water while you're there. That's because drinking to excess (more than two drinks each day) is linked to irregular periods,lack of ovulation, and abnormal estrogen and progesterone levels, which can make it harder to conceive. Plus, if you're charting, it can make it challenging totemp accurately.  AdvertisementThe other reason why you might want to nix the alcohol is because, well, you'll have to anyhow once you get pregnant, to eliminate the possibility of fetal alcohol syndrome, and it will take about two weeks (or more) after you conceive to know that you're actually pregnant. Tell your partner to limit his alcohol intake too. There's evidence that drinking can affecthis fertility as well.Extremes in weightDo you think you might be extremely overweight or underweight? Calculate your body mass index (BMI) using this tool now.Having a lowBMI (18.5 or less) or a very high BMI (over 30) could cause you to have irregular or missed periods. Andbeing extremely underweight couldmake you stop ovulating altogether.Obesity can increase the risk of pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, birth defects and the need fora c-section. So it's important to be at a healthy weight when you're trying to conceive.If you fall into either of these categories, talk to your doctor about how to get to a healthy weight. You'll want to eat right, getting plenty of nutrients; exercise; and drink plenty of water. Often, even a small weight gain or loss is enough to get your body ready to make a baby, as long as it's done healthily.Passing on the veggiesThe jury's out on whether certain foods actually make you more fertile, but there's one thing the experts agree on: If your body's in a healthy state, you're more likely to conceive, so eating right is essential. The other important reason to say no to the fries and yes to the spinach salad is folic acid. This B vitamin is found in leafy greens and is important to have present in your body before and after conception to prevent birth defects. Doctors recommend you also take a vitamin with at least 400 micrograms of folic acid while you're trying to conceive.  AdvertisementNeglecting your teethIf you've been lax, now's the time to get back on track with your dentist appointments  and make sure you're flossing. You and your partner shouldbothget your pearly whites super-healthy before you get pregnant. Poor oral hygiene can affect a man's sperm, and if you have gum disease, it could increase your risk of having a premature delivery and low-birth-weight baby. Yikes!Being a couch potatoKeep making excuses not to exercise? Stop! One study found that doing regular, moderate physical activitybrisk walking, leisurely cycling, golfing and gardeningcut the amount of time it took women to get pregnant.Extreme exerciseYou want to stay fit, but you don't want to overdo it. In the same study we mentioned above, vigorous exercise increased the amount of time it took women to get pregnant. We're not saying to skip your morning run if that's what you've always done, but working out to the point of interfering with your menstrual cycle,as some marathonrunners and gymnasts experience,can mess with your fertility.BPATime to invest in a metal water bottleBPA, aka bisphenol A, is a chemical found in plastic items, such as water bottles, food containers and even in the lining of aluminum cans. Some studies have led scientists to believe that highBPA exposure could mess with men's and women's fertility, potentially lowering sperm count or reducing the number of viable eggs. There's virtually no way to prevent BPA exposure altogether, but you can limit yours by avoiding canned foods and avoiding consuming anything from a plastic container with the recycling number 3 or 7 on it (usually on the bottom of the container).  AdvertisementStressing out We've all got a little bit of stress in our lives, and experts disagree on whether stress can _cause _infertility. But there's evidence that chronic or intense stress can do a number on your reproductive system, and, well, having trouble getting pregnant can cause quite a bit of stress! So if you feel that your stress levels might be affecting your health and your ability to conceive, talk to your doctor about ways to cope. Several studies have found that alternative medicines, such as yoga and acupuncture, have actually shortened the time it took for infertility patients to get pregnant.High-mercury fishSome fish are higher in mercury than othersmost notably marlin, orange roughy, tilefish, swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and ahi and bigeye tuna. High levels of mercury in the blood have been linked to fertility issues in both men and women. Plus, mercury can stay in your system for a year or more, and can harm a fetus's developing brain and nervous system, so avoiding it will increase your chances of a healthy pregnancy. Love seafood? There's plenty that's considered low-mercury, including anchovies, catfish, clams, crab, crawfish, flounder, haddock, herring, mackerel, oysters, salmon, sardines, scallops, shrimp, sole, squid, tilapia, trout and whitefish. You can have two six-ounce servings of low-mercury seafood per week while pregnant.Plus, more from The Bump:6 Ways to Naturally Boost Your Fertility10 Common Fertility MistakesTiming Sex to Get Pregnant FasterPHOTO:ShutterstockRelated Video"
Mom-to-Be's Fruits-Only Diet Is Intense \u2014 but Is It Bad for Baby?,https://www.thebump.com/a/mom-to-bes-fruit-only-diet-is-intense-but-is-it-bad-for-baby,"When Loni Jane Anthony, a 25-year-old Australian mom-to-be, posted photos of her raw, plant-based diet on Instagram, Internet-chaos ensued. Anthony, who is 26 weeks pregnant, follows the 80:10:10 Diet, consisting of 80 carbs, 10 percent fat and 10 percent protein. A typical morning for her starts out with 10 bananas. The nutrition plan was founded by raw-foodist Dr. Douglas Graham.Here's where the controversy kicks in: When Anthony's photos hit the Insta-universe, people were concerned that Anthony wasn't getting enough nutrition to sustain herself, let alone her growing baby. But Loni told News.com.au in an interview that she's subscribed by the diet for the past three years due to health problems that nearly took her life. She said that an average day starts with warm lemon water followed by half of a watermelon, a banana smoothie or whole oranges, five to six mangos for lunch and a large salad for dinner. Loni treats herself to an alcoholic drink once every five months (though not during her pregnancy. ""[This diet] wasn't for weight loss or for a quick fix,"" she told the site. ""I was internally really sick; I was killing myself slowly. Some days, even on my Tumblr, the amount of questions I get asked is just insane. I'm like 'why are people so interested in me? I'm just sitting here eating my bananas. I'm not anyone special.'""Loni uses her Instagram page to document her unique fruitarian meals and on her Tumblr, Aleven:11, she credits the lifestyle change for doing ""great things"" for her reproductive system and hormones. She's even the first to say that she's no a medical expert and has no expert knowledge in the reproductive field. Being pregnant hasn't changed much by the way of meal planning, either. ""My eating habits are still the same as when I wasnt pregnant. I have eaten more cooked food for dinners during the pregnancy but other than that still on a high raw high card plant based lifestyle.""  AdvertisementDo I think that her lifestyle is intense? Yes, there's absolutely no doubt about that. Do I think it's bad for baby? I don't know. Medical professionals remind moms-to-be not to drastically alter their routines when they're expecting so if Loni's been practicing this type of lifestyle for three years, it doesn't make sense to make a huge change that would, no doubt, shock her system and be potentially harmful baby. I'm not saying that Loni's way is the right way (or the wrong way)  and I'm definitely not saying that this type of diet is sustainable ('cause this girl likes her chocolates, y'all!), but if Loni's seeing an OB regularly and baby's health isn't in jeopardy by her nutritional choices, then who am I to judge?Here are a few of the photos from Loni's Instagram that have garnered the most attention:Photos Courtesy of Loni Jane AnthonyDo you think this type of diet is dangerous for baby?Related Video"
Q&A: Why Is Baby Drinking Less Breast Milk? Jeanne Cygnus ...,https://www.thebump.com/a/baby-nursing-less-after-starting-solids,"It's absolutely normal for baby to drink less breast milk if she is eating a significant amount of solid foods. She's simply beginning to move toward a more grown up diet. If you think it's because she's just too distracted to breastfeed, though, try moving feedings to a dark, quiet room. (Some babies have a tough time concentrating on nursing once they are interacting more with the world around them.) And as always, keep an eye on her weight gain for assurance that she's staying hydrated and getting enough nutrition. Speaking of nutrition, make sure you're starting baby on a healthy path by offering a balanced diet full of vitamins and nutrients as she grows. (If she's filling up on fresh fruits, veggies, and whole grains instead of breast milk, that's great. If she's filling up on cookies and juice, that's not so great.)Baby will eventually drop more and more feedings as she grows older and eats more solids. But even if you get down to one or two feedings per day, the breast milk you're providing is an awesome source of nutrients that she may not be getting in her diet  so keep it up. The general recommendation is that from six through nine months you should breastfeed first  to assure that your baby gets the milk she needs  then top her off with solids. From nine to 12 months you can then reverse this and offer meals first, topping her off with your milk after and in between meals.PHOTO:BabymewRelated Video"
What Should I Feed Baby For Breakfast? Bonnie Vengrow ...,https://www.thebump.com/a/baby-breakfast-ideas,"For an infant, breakfast isnt the most important meal of the day. Right now, baby is getting most of his nutrition from breast milk or formula, and eating food is more about trying a variety of foods than about finishing a bowl of rice cereal.Worry about quality, and let your baby worry about quantity, says Scott Cohen, MD, a pediatrician and author of_ Eat, Sleep, Poop: A Common Sense Guide to Your Babys First Year_.Start with fine purees for a brand-new eater, and graduate up to thicker purees, mashes and soft, small finger foods when hes developmentally ready. These are a few tried and true breakfast ideas from Amelia Winslow, nutritionist and founder of Eating Made Easy, and Bridget Swinney, president of the El Paso Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and author of Eating Expectantly, Baby Bites and Healthy Food for Healthy Kids: Plain whole-milk yogurt mixed with oatmeal thats been ground up in the food processor before being cooked. Fresh peaches, pureed and mixed with quinoa baby cereal. Applesauce, preferably homemade, mixed with a small amount of ricotta cheese and cinnamon. If the applesauce is store-bought, the only ingredient should be apples, Winslow says. Baby oatmeal with pureed mango. Mixed-grain cereal with mashed banana. Small pieces of scrambled eggs with spinach, whole-wheat toast strips, and small or mashed pieces of very ripe melon (for older babies).Ideally, youre already eating a healthy breakfast, so rather than playing short-order cook, you can let baby sample whats on your plate. Around eight months or so, you can put small pieces of scrambled eggs on the tray and let baby play around with them, says Cohen. Give him little pieces of fruit, some cereal or oatmeal. Pancakes and waffles are okay too  just mush them up with your fingers so baby cant choke on them.

"Can Baby Be Vegan? Jennifer Mellick, MD Pediatrician",https://www.thebump.com/a/baby-vegan,"Vegans eat no animal products  meaning that, in addition to no meat or seafood, they dont eat things like dairy products, honey and gelatin. If youre raising baby as a vegan, you may have some concerns about her getting enough nutrients, since her diet is limited. Most parents worry about baby getting adequate amounts of protein and iron (which are normally consumed through meat products), and what kinds of foods will supplement those nutrients. But its not impossible for baby to maintain a vegan diet, especially if shes still breastfeeding, since shell get vitamins, protein and iron through that. If youre breastfeeding and youre a vegan, talk with your doctor or nutritionist to make sure youre getting enough B12 in your diet or through supplements, so it can be passed to baby through your breast milk. If you dont take a vitamin B12 supplement, then baby should take one.When it comes to deciding what kind of milk to give baby, the obvious answer for many vegan parents is breast milk. Some vegan parents may choose soy formula  be sure to check the type you plan to use with babys pediatrician first. You can keep breastfeeding as long as youd like, but once baby turns one, some parents choose to introduce other types of milk. What baby needs from milk is protein, fat (a healthy source) and calcium. There are a few different nondairy options, with some things to consider about each:Soy milk is an acceptable alternative to cows milk, but its lower in fat. Its hard to get enough calories in a growing toddler as it is, so if you stick to soy, itll be even more difficult. If you get soy milk from a paper-based container, make sure you shake it, since the calcium in soy milk can stick to the sides.  AdvertisementAlmond milk is growing increasingly popular as well. It has a comparable fat content to cows milk, but less protein. Both soy and almond milk need to be fortified with B12 vitamins for strict vegans.Rice milk is very low in fat and calories. It contains very little protein, and its not usually recommended for toddlers who are vegan.Coconut milk is a newer fad in vegan diets. Be careful, since it can be very high in calories, lower in calcium and protein, and higher in saturated fats.To decide which kind of milk is best for your toddler, discuss the pros and cons of each with your pediatrician and be sure to talk over the rest of your childs diet. Your child should also be getting an adequate amount of nutrients from solid foods.When baby starts on solids (normally around four to six months old), she can have fruits and vegetables that are pureed. There are a few things to pay extra attention to:Protein. You can also feed your baby vegan-friendly foods with plenty of protein, like pureed tofu or strained veggies (like beans, peas, chickpeas and lentils).Iron. To make sure babys getting enough iron, you can give her iron-fortified cereals, soybeans, broccoli and pureed dried fruits like raisins and figs.Calcium. For calcium intake, baby can have soy products, calcium-fortified juices (though these should be limited, as too much juice isnt recommended) and green leafy vegetables. Often, a vegan baby will need a vitamin supplement that contains calcium.  AdvertisementCalories. Vegan toddlers may have trouble getting enough calories from fruits and vegetables owing to the bulk of fiber and their small tummies. Iron-fortified and high-protein foods can help with this issue.Plus, more from The Bump:Best Foods for BabySafe Solids for BabyFinger Foods for BabyRelated Video"
Eating for Healthy Weight Gain?,https://www.thebump.com/a/eating-for-healthy-weight-gain,"There are lots of numbers youll be told throughout your pregnancy. First, your OB will tell you how much weight you should gain. The general rule of thumb is that women of normal weight before pregnancy should gain 25-35 pounds. And women who are overweight pre-pregnancy should gain about 15-25 pounds.You might also be told that the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends pregnant women of normal weight eat 1,800 calories per day during the first trimester; 2,200 calories per day in the second trimester, and 2,400 calories per day in the third.But really, paying too much attention to those numbers will just stress you out. So take the focus off the scale, and definitely dont count calories. Instead, set your sights on eating quality food, says Melinda Johnson, MS, RD, Director of the Didactic Program in Dietetics at Arizona State University and spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. As long as you try to eat nutritious foods, your weight should be just fine, she says. Aim for three meals and one or two snacks a day. For each meal, include three food groups, and for snacks, include two food groups. Also, get some exercise if your doctor allows it.If youre concerned about your diet, or youve had disordered eating patterns, schedule a visit with a Registered Dietitian to make sure youre on the right track  and that you stay that way throughout your pregnancy.Plus, more from The Bump:Tales From the Scale: The Obsession With Pregnancy Weight Gain  AdvertisementHealthy Pregnancy Weight Gain?Tips for Eating Right During Your PregnancyRelated Video"
10 Breastfeeding Superfoods,https://www.thebump.com/a/what-to-eat-breastfeeding,"OatmealOats are a completely natural whole grain, high-fiber food. A bowl of oatmeal will keep you full for a long time after breakfastand may help increase your milk supply. Plus, oats are high in iron; and iron-deficiency anemia, which is common in new moms, can mess with your milk supply.Good news: Quick oatsthe kind that cook up in about a minuteare just as healthy as steel-cut oats, which can take much longer to prepare. But avoid pre-packaged instant oatmeal, which usually contains extra salt and sugar.AlmondsAlmonds arent just packed with protein; theyre a good non-dairy source of calcium. And the every little bit helps. Breastfeeding moms should take in 1000 mg of calcium per day. Thats because the milk you make is high in calcium, and if you dont get enough in your diet, your bones and teeth could be robbed of calcium they need. (Yikes!)There are some exceptions though. If youre allergic to almonds, theyre obviously a no-no. And if your family history includes a history of nut allergies, you might want to hold off on them until your baby is at least 3 months old, since food proteins more easily pass from a mom to her babys bloodstream (via the babys gut) in the first three months of babys life.ApricotsApricots contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C and potassium, all essential nutrients. Eating apricots can also increase prolactinthat's the hormone that tells your body to produce milk. Fresh, whole apricots are a better source of fiber than canned apricots; if you go canned, look for ones packed in water or natural juices, instead of sugary syrup. Dried apricots are also easy to toss in the diaper bag for an on-the-go snack.  AdvertisementSalmonThis tasty, fatty fish might be the perfect meat for breastfeeding moms. Its high in protein, and also contains large amounts of DHA, a type of fat thats important to the development of babys nervous system. Wild-caught or farm-raised salmon are both good for you. If you dont eat dairy, you can eat canned salmon, which contains tiny salmon bones, to get some extra calcium.YogurtStocking your fridge with yogurt is smart because the creamy stuff has got both protein and calcium (and with all those flavors available, youre bound to find a few you love). Just beware that some breastfeeding moms are told to give up dairy if baby is diagnosed with milk protein intolerance. Signs your baby could be one of them include frequent spitting up, diarrhea, bloody stools, rashes, coughing and wheezing.BeansFiber-rich kidney, black, pinto and other beans can be good for your digestive system, and theyre fantastic sources of iron and protein. Its true that you might get a little, um, gassy, after eating beans, but when passed through breast milk, they wont give your baby gas. Promise.SpinachActually, pretty much any dark green, leafy veggie is a breastfeeding super food. That includes broccoli and Swiss chard. Theyre all-around nutrient-dense and even high in calcium. (This ones for you vegan moms!) So you can get a veggie serving and a calcium-rich serving in one, delicious, leafy food. Plus, we love how versatile spinach can be. Eat it fresh in a salad, sautee it as a side, or add it to lasagna or another favorite entre.  AdvertisementDatesDates are another calcium-rich foodand theyre thought to help increase milk supply, since they increase prolactin like apricots do. Theyre also a high-fiber, naturally sweet treat. Chop some and add them to your morning oatmeal.Sesame seedsWho knew? Sesame seeds are packed with calcium, and are a good source of fiber, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, copper and manganese. Toast them and sprinkle them over a salad of dark leafy greens. Or add some to your veggies; green beans and sesame seeds are a tasty combo.Brown riceSkip the white stuff. Brown rice is better for you because its got more fiber and other nutrients. Complex carbs like brown rice (and oatmeal) help keep you full and keep your blood sugar at consistent levels (no drastic energy dips!). Dont have time to boil a pot of brown rice? Instant and boil-in-bag brown rice have the same nutrition content as the regular kind, but require less effort.Plus, more from The Bump:10 Ways to Eat Healthy While Breastfeeding6 Smart Ways to Lose the Baby Weight While Breastfeeding9 Things Every New Mom Should Have In Her KitchenRelated Video    All medical information reviewed by    Dr. Paula Prezioso    of Pediatric Associates in New York City."
Difference Between Foremilk and Hindmilk?,https://www.thebump.com/a/difference-between-foremilk-and-hindmilk,"The breast milk the baby gets at the beginning of a feeding session is called the foremilk, which is more watery and high in volume but low in fat. As the feeding progresses, the fat content of the milk rises steadily as the volume decreases. The milk near the end of the feeding is low in volume but high in fat and is called the hindmilk.While there are two different names for the two types of milk, theres no magic moment when foremilk becomes hindmilk. As the baby breastfeeds, the increase in fat content is gradual, with the milk becoming fattier and fattier over time as baby becomes closer to draining the breast.Knowing that there are two different kinds of milk has created anxiety in many women  its easy to start to worry about whether baby is getting enough of the fatty hindmilk. But this isnt something you need to be concerned about. Its the total milk consumed daily  not specifically the hindmilk  that helps baby gain a healthy amount of weight. Whether babies breastfeed often for shorter periods or go for hours between feedings and feed longer, their total daily fat consumption does not actually vary.So dont worry about how much hindmilk your baby is getting or try to coax her to feed longer. As long as baby breastfeeds effectively, until shes satisfied, and you dont regularly cut feedings short, shell receive about the same amount of milk fat over the course of a day no matter what her breastfeeding pattern. This is because the baby who breastfeeds more often consumes foremilk higher in fat than the baby who breastfeeds less often. So in the end it all evens out.Related Video"

Breastfeeding While Pregnant Elena Donovan Mauer,https://www.thebump.com/a/breastfeeding-while-pregnant,"Keeping baby-to-be safe  Forget the myths  you can keep nursing, as long as your doctor hasnt put you on any activity restrictions (such as no sex) and youre not experiencingbleeding or premature labor. While mothers with a history ofmiscarriage are sometimes advised not to breastfeed [during pregnancy], there is no evidence to show that breastfeeding increases a mother's risk for premature labor and birth, says Amy Spangler, MN, RN, IBCLC, author of Breastfeeding: A Parents Guide. The myth that the nipple stimulation of breastfeeding could cause contractions and result in preterm labor is rooted in fact, but those contractions are unlikely to be strong enough to make you go into labor. Nipple stimulation triggers the release of oxytocin, a hormone that causes milk release. Oxytocin also causes the uterus to contract, explains Spangler. Most women experience uterine contractions while breastfeeding, but they are usually mild and often go unnoticed.... And the uterus may be less sensitive to oxytocin during pregnancy, making the risk for uterine contractions even smaller. So dont hesitate to continue your breastfeeding relationship if your doctor has okayed it. ""If a mother is experiencing premature labor and/or vaginal bleeding, her health care provider may suggest she wean,"" says Spangler.""Fortunately, these situations are extremely rare, and each must be considered on an individual basis.""  Changes to your body  One of the earliest bumps in the road you might experience issore breasts  a common first-trimester symptom. Obviously, that could make breastfeeding more than a little uncomfortable. But Spangler says to stick with it. Often, the tenderness is mild and short-lived, and perhaps with some minor position changes, a mom can continue to breastfeed throughout pregnancy, she says. Only in rare cases is the tenderness so severe that a mother chooses to wean.  Advertisement  Your milk supply  Some moms dont find any issues with milk supply after they get pregnant, but others find that theirs decreases  blame it on the hormones. An older baby may respond by simply breastfeeding more often, says Spangler, since more frequent nursing can spur your body to produce more milk. And if babys old enough to get started on solid foods, the other things he eats might naturally make up for any less milk he gets just make sure breast milk is still his main nutrient source if he's under one year old. As long as baby still wants to feed, seems satisfied afterward and is gaining weight healthfully, theres no need to supplement. If you have any concerns about babys weight gain, consult babys pediatrician or your lactation consultant for advice.  Staying healthy  Remember, youre growing a baby and feeding a baby. You should be taking good care of yourself. The best way to ensure that you stay healthy is to eat a variety of healthy foods each day, making sure that all the basic food groups are represented  fruits, vegetables, proteins, fats  and drink enough liquid to satisfy your thirst: water and unsweetened fruit juice, says Spangler. Also, take prenatal vitamins prescribed by your health care provider. Youre probably also wondering how much you should be eating. It depends on the age of the baby and the weight of the mother, says Spangler, since younger babies feed more often (which burns more of your calories) and different moms have different levels of fat stores. A mother who is nursing a toddler infrequently may need no additional calories, while a mother who is exclusively breastfeeding a three-month-old and has small fat stores may need an additional 650 calories each day, says Spangler. She says eating when you're hungry and drinking when you're thirsty are really your best guides to make sure you're getting enough calories and hydration  seems simple, but when you're a busy mom, that can sometimes be neglected. Make it a point to keep healthy snacks and water handy.  Advertisement  The transition to colostrum  Probably around your fourth month of pregnancy, your body will start the gradual transition from making mature milk to colostrum, that thick, yellow milky stuff a newborn consumes. This might taste different to your baby  and prepare yourself for the possibility that he might gradually wean himself as a result. If he doesnt wean, dont worry, and feel free to keep it up. Despite the change [to colostrum], a mother's milk will continue to meet the needs of her breastfeeding baby, so no supplements are needed, says Spangler.  Getting ready for baby number two  As you near your due date, consider how things will change once the new baby is born. Enjoy the one-on-one time with your older baby for as long as possible, knowing that feeding three  mom, toddler and baby  presents a new set of challenges, recommends Spangler. If youre considering nursing both children but worried about being able to meet their nutritional needs, think about the moms of twins who breastfeed. Because toddlers also eat solid foods, meeting the nutritional needs of a baby and a toddler is actually easier than meeting the needs of two babies, says Spangler. Mentally prepare yourself for your toddler to react to the change of having a new sibling whos also nursing. Mothers often find that their older baby or toddler wants to breastfeed more often after the baby is born  perhaps every time the baby breastfeeds, explains Spangler. But once the toddler realizes that a sibling is a permanent addition to the family, the feeding frequency will usually return to normal. Many mothers find that tandem nursing actually makes it easier to meet the nutritional and the emotional needs of different-age babies.Related Video"

Weight Gain During Pregnancy,https://www.thebump.com/a/weight-gain-during-pregnancy,"How much weight gain is normal?If your weight is in the normal range (a body mass index of 18 to 25) before you conceive, The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends a gain of 25 to 35 pounds throughout pregnancy. Expect to add three to five pounds during thefirst trimester and one to two pounds each week after. According to the ACOG, if youre underweight at conception, you should gain 28 to 40 pounds. If youre overweight, try to keep it to 15 to 25 pounds. No matter what your starting weight, your goal is to keep the gain as steady as possible. Baby needs a daily supply of nutrients, and those come from the foods you eat.What could cause excessive weight gain?Weight gain is, of course, normal  and healthy  throughout pregnancy. But gaining weight suddenly or excessively could be a sign of preeclampsia, a serious pregnancy condition.When should I go to the doctor with concerns regarding weight?Dont worry if your weight gain fluctuates a bit from week to week, but contact your doctor if you suddenly gain or lose weight, especially in the third trimester. What should I do to gain weight healthily during pregnancy?A side note: You might think youll have no problem staying within your gain range, but don't be surprised at how quickly the pounds can pile on. Pregnancy only gives you license to consume an extra 300 calories a day  the equivalent of a very small bagel, sans cream cheese. But, instead of stressing out about the quantities you consume, focus on eating quality foods and steering clear of junk foods that add bulk without nutrients.

10 Worst Foods For Pregnant Women Joanne Van Zuidam,https://www.thebump.com/a/worst-foods-for-pregnant-women,"High-mercury seafoodShark, swordfish tilefish, and canned albacore tuna are the biggies (literally) on the list of fish to skip. Mercury accumulates over time, and because these large fish live longer, they store more mercury in their flesh, explains Sarah Krieger, MPH, RDN, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Mercury accumulates in people too, and it can hurt babys brain, hearing and vision, so put high-mercury fish on your do not eat list.As for low-mercury fish, such as tilapia, cod, salmon, trout, catfish and shellfish, theyre actually good for you and baby. Theyre excellent sources of lean protein, B-12, and zinc. And salmon, trout and mackerel are rich in omega-3 fatty acids, including DHA (which may boost babys brain development). But they do have some mercury in them, so keep to 12 ounces or less of them a week. Also, make sure all the fish and seafood you eat are very fresh and cooked thoroughly.SushiSpeaking of cooking your fish, youve got to. That means sushi and sashimi are off limits. Some bacteria can only killed by heat and since sushi is served raw, theres an increased likeliness for food poisoning. Some moms-to-be order rolls made of cooked fish at the sushi bar, but Krieger even recommends avoiding those, since theres the potential for cross contamination. Choose a teriyaki or hibachi entre instead.Deli meatDrop that ham and cheese sandwich  cold cuts (including ham, turkey, bologna and more) are actually dangerous for you and baby. And so are hot dogs. These meats can be contaminated with listeria  the only known bacterium that can survive at refrigerator temperatures of 40 degrees or less. And unlike other types of food poisoning, listeriosis, the infection caused by listeria, enters into the bloodstream directly and can reach the baby through the placenta. Listeriosis is especially scary because it can cause miscarriage. Luckily, heating foods to at least 145 degrees (165 if its leftovers) will kill the bacteria, so you can grill that ham sandwich and still enjoy it.  AdvertisementPrepared deli foodsBasically, youll want to avoid the deli counter altogether (sorry!). The problem, Krieger says, is that you dont know how long the foods have been in the refrigerated case, what the temperature is in there (and if it stays at a consistent 40 degrees or less), and whether all the ingredients in a salad or dish have been pasteurized. Instead, make your own potato or pasta salad, so you know exactly what youre eating.Unpasteurized cheeseWhat to look for in cheese: pasteurization. Always check the label. While feta or mozzarella may be pasteurized, it may not be. The same goes for brie, camembert, bleu cheese, and some Mexican cheeses. If its fresh or homemade, like some mozzarella or a small-batch artisan cheese is, ask the person that prepared it. And when in doubt, skip it for now, says Krieger, since unpasteurized cheese can carry listeria. Go for a safer slice, like cheddar or Swiss.Raw bean sproutsThey add a satisfying crunch to salad and pad Thai  and they seem super healthy  but sprouts can harbor bacteria such as salmonella, listeria and E. coli. Any raw vegetable that swims in a pool of water in its package is at high risk for bacteria, says Krieger. So youll also want to throw out a bag of lettuce if it pools in water. And, speaking of packaged salad, eat it within a day or two of opening it.Raw dough and batterWe know, youre craving it. But, for babys sake, resist licking the spoon when youre baking. When its unbaked, dough and batter can contain salmonella, which can cause food-borne illness. Plus, Even though some commercial cookie dough lists pasteurized eggs in the ingredients list, I dont recommend eating raw cookie dough, says Krieger. It lacks nutrition.  AdvertisementUnpasteurized juiceOut at the farmers market? If youre not sure ifthe juice or cider is pasteurized, pass. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires warning labels on any fruit or vegetable juice that has not been pasteurized. However, the agency does not require labels for fresh-squeezed juices or cider sold by the glass (like at health-food stores, juice bars, farm stands and apple orchards). Kriegers rule of thumb: If this fruit or veggie is juiced on the spot and consumed within an hour, its safe. But freshly-squeezed juices that sit around for longer than that are too risky for pregnant women to consume.Venti-sized caffeinated drinksWhile caffeine may be safe in small amounts (one to two cups of coffee per day), pregnant women with high blood pressure or anxiety should completely abstain, since the stimulant may aggravate those conditions. The recommendations are conservative since mega amounts of caffeine during pregnancy are unknown, adds Krieger. We do know that erring on the side of less is best. So if you drink more than two small cups of coffee each day, make the rest decaf.Herbal teaSurprisingly, you should avoid some tea, too  even if it doesnt have caffeine. There are not many studies on herbs during pregnancy, says Krieger. Go ahead and stick to decaf black, white or green tea or with familiar herbs, such as lemon verbena, mint or chamomile. But if its something youre unsure of, dont have it. And, really, avoid anything in excess during pregnancy. In other words, if you have tea, mix up the variety youre drinking so nothing potentially harmful can accumulate in large quantities in your body.

Losing Weight During Pregnancy? Paula Kashtan,https://www.thebump.com/a/losing-weight-during-pregnancy,"It certainly seems strange to lose weight when youre creating a whole new person, but its probably nothing to fret about. Morning sickness and the accompanying loss of appetite can cause you to shed a few pounds in the first trimester. Don't worry  you'll more than make up for this loss in the upcoming months. And remember, most women only gain between two and five pounds in the first trimester.Still, you can (and should) take action to ensure you and baby get the nutrients you need. Prenatal vitamins are the way to go,though you might want to ask your doctor about one with a low dose of iron (the mineral can actually make nausea worse). And, try to eat whenever you can stand it. An empty stomach can actually trigger nausea, as can low blood sugar,so eat before you are hungry and always keep snacks nearby. Getting extra sleep and cutting down the stress will also work wonders for your appetite.For an alternative remedy, try ginger. (Ginger ale, ginger candies, ginger beef with snow peas) It has a long history of making tummies feel better. Or slip on an acupressure band, found at most drugstores.The bands  meant to ward off seasickness help many a mom fight the queasies.

Lactose Intolerance During Pregnancy,https://www.thebump.com/a/lactose-intolerance-during-pregnancy,"What is lactose intolerance during pregnancy?People who are lactose intolerant lack lactase, the enzyme that normally digests a sugar called lactose. Since lactose is found in dairy products, eating them makes you feel sick. If youre lactose intolerant, youre probably wondering how to get the calcium you need during pregnancy without getting sick.What are the signs of lactose intolerance during pregnancy?The most common signs of lactose intolerance are abdominal pain, bloating, cramping and gas after ingesting dairy products. Sounds a lot like general pregnancy symptoms, right?Are there any tests for lactose intolerance during pregnancy?Yes. Sometimes a doctor diagnoses lactose intolerance based on symptoms. If you consistently experience abdominal pain, bloating and gas after eating or drinking dairy  but you feel fine after cutting dairy out of your diet  youre probably lactose intolerant. A simple breath test or blood test, performed in a doctors office, can confirm the diagnosis.How common is lactose intolerance?Pretty common. Its more common in adults (who dont have the same biological need to drink milk that young kids do), and its more common among people of African, Asian, South American or Native American descent.How did I get lactose intolerance?It might be genetic. Other times, lactose intolerance is caused by an injury to the small intestine, which normally produces lactase.How will lactose intolerance affect my baby?You dont have to drink milk to have a healthy baby, but you do need to make sure to get enough calcium. Know that baby will be fine no matter what  even if you skimp on calcium  but thats because your body will draw calcium from your bones and teeth to make sure your baby has what she needs to grow healthy and strong. And that can have devastating long-term effects on your own health, causing osteoporosis (see next page for tips on getting enough calcium without dairy).  AdvertisementWhats the best way to treat lactose intolerance?You can avoid dairy altogether. If you cant tolerate cows milk, try almond, soy or rice milk. Calcium is also in kale, broccoli and salmon. Some women with lactose intolerance can handle yogurt, so you might want to try it to see how it goes.It can be hard to reach the recommended pregnancy intake of 1,200 mg of calcium per day without eating or drinking dairy, so many pregnant women who are lactose intolerant take calcium supplements. If youre choosing between a calcium carbonate and a calcium citrate supplement, Michelle Collins, CNM, an assistant professor of nurse-midwifery at Vanderbilt University, recommends going with the citrate. Calcium citrate is much more absorbable and doesnt cause constipation, so it tends to work better for pregnant women.You can also try Lactaid, which is an over-the-counter form of lactase that allows you to digest lactose (and eat dairy!).What can I do to prevent lactose intolerance?You cant prevent lactose intolerance, but you can manage the symptoms.What do other pregnant moms do when they have lactose intolerance?I think I may have developed an intolerance to lactose over the last three months... I have been keeping track of my reaction to dairy and it is becoming increasingly unpleasant... I mainly have problems with just straight milk. Most cheese and yogurts don't cause me nearly as much discomfort! I have been taking calcium supplements throughout the pregnancyAround the beginning of my second trimester I realized that milk was making me suffer. Anything containing real cream is even worse.

Your Pregnancy Diet: A Starter's Shopping List,https://www.thebump.com/a/your-pregnancy-diet-a-starters-shopping-list,"Now that youre pregnant, your overall diet needs to be well-balanced to ensure that you and baby get the right amount of vitamins and minerals. A little overwhelmed by all the eat this, not that advice youve been getting lately? We dont blame you. So lets make things simple: Heres a cheat sheet of what to add to your shopping list (if they arent on it already) the next time youre cruising the grocery aisles:The Basics Whole grains Whole wheat bread Brown rice Bran cereal Black beans Lentils Lima beans Chickpeas Citrus fruit Broccoli Tomatoes Spinach Kale Sweet Potatoes SquashEating lots of different-colored fruits and veggies will help you get in an array of vitamins and minerals. Citrus fruits, broccoli and tomatoes are good sources of vitamin C, which will promote healthy skin and gums, among other things. Dark, leafy greens are a great way to get in the vitamin A, folate and iron that you need during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Sweet potatoes and squash are high in fiber and rich in vitamins A and C and make a great choice for a nutritious side dish or as ingredients in soups and casseroles. Spinach is also a good source of iron. Now that extra blood is circulating in your body, youll need to get more iron in your diet so you dont become anemic. Plus, opting for veggies and whole grains that are high in fiber will keep you feeling full. They're also low in fat and help alleviate constipation. Foods that are high in folic acidlike spinach, lentils, chickpeas and morewill also help develop babys nervous system.  AdvertisementProteinSince protein is one of the essential building blocks for muscle, tissue, and all sorts of other new cells, getting the required amount is crucial when youre pregnant. (Its also important after pregnancy, when youre exercising and trying to build up new muscle.) Browse this list of options to make sure youre working enough protein into your diet each day: Organic chicken Turkey (fresh, not deli meat) Beef Lamb Veal Liver Ham Wild salmon Milk Yogurt Soy milk Tofu Pasteurized cheese Eggs In addition to protein, dairy offers up calcium, which helps build bones and strong muscles. If you dont consume enough, babys bones steal calcium from yours, which ups your risk of osteoporosis later in life. You can look for brands of yogurt that are fortified with folic acid and Vitamin D. Vegetarian RecommendationsIf youre a vegetarian, youll want to pay extra attention to the amount of protein youre getting at every meal (consider popping a vitamin B12 supplement each day too). Try incorporating as many of these veggie-friendly foods in your diet as possible: Legumes Black beans Navy beans Pinto beans Peas Soybeans Tofu Tempeh Whole grains Natural peanut butter Flaxseed Olive oilFlaxseed, while rich in protein, is also a good source of DHA (also found in salmon, wheat germ and nuts), which is crucial during pregnancy in helping baby's brain, cells, and retinal, nervous and cardiovascular systems develop properly.

Q&A: Breastfeeding after a year?,https://www.thebump.com/a/benefits-of-breastfeeding-beyond-one-year,"All the health benefits of breastfeeding continue after baby's first birthday, including offering fabulous nutritional content and improved resistance to infections. Children who are still breastfeeding and attend daycare are known to have fewer and less severe infections than non-breastfeeding kids, meaning mama has to take fewer days off work.Some parents worry that extending breastfeeding could hamper baby's independence, but breastfed toddlers prove the opposite. Children who wean on their own time often seem to gain confidence by taking this step themselves. (And children who are weaned before theyre developmentally ready can sometimes become extra-clingy.)Breastfeeding can also be a sort of secret weapon for the mom of a toddler; nothing soothes a sick, scared, hurt, or upset child (or their mom) better than nursing. Plus, mom and baby get to continue to enjoy the intimacy of their breastfeeding relationship. As Dr. Jack Newman says in his article, Breastfeeding a Toddler  Why on Earth?, ""Breastfeeding is a life-affirming act of love.""In our culture breastfeeding moms of toddlers sometimes catch some flack, but these policy statements from major health organizations affirm that there are, indeed, benefits to breastfeeding for the long haul:The World Health Organization says:""Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended up to six months of age, with continued breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods up to two years of age or beyond.""According to the American Academy of Pediatrics:""Breastfeeding should be continued for at least the first year of life and beyond for as long as mutually desired by mother and child....Increased duration of breastfeeding confers significant health and developmental benefits for the child and the mother....There is no upper limit to the duration of breastfeeding and no evidence of psychological or developmental harm from breastfeeding into the third year of life or longer."" (AAP 2005)According to the American Academy of Family Physicians:""Breastfeeding beyond the first year offers considerable benefits to both mother and child and should continue as long as mutually desired.If the child is younger than two years of age, the child is at increased risk of illness if weaned.""

7 Smart Ways to Lose Weight While Breastfeeding,https://www.thebump.com/a/lose-weight-breastfeeding,"There are a lot of misconceptions out there about weight loss and breastfeeding, says Jennifer Ritchie, IBCLC and author of I Make MilkWhats Your Superpower? Some people believe that the weight just drops off if youre breastfeeding. Others think its hard to get your body back while youre breastfeeding.Neither is exactly right. Breastfeeding does burn extra calories  approximately 850 calories a day, to be exact. (Wow!) But losing weight while breastfeeding is rarely a given because breastfeeding makes moms hungrier. And hungry, sleep-deprived new moms tend to satisfy their cravings with simple carbohydrates  it's not exactly easy to lose weight when youre eating those.When normal, healthy adults are sleep deprived, they typically increase their carbohydrate consumption to make up for the lack of sleep, Ritchie explains. We end up reaching for the cookies.Dont pressure yourselfSorry, but you wont be stepping into your pre-pregnancy jeans right away. And trying to put them on in the early weeks will just be discouraging. In order to deliver a baby, everything in the body expands, Ritchie says. Your hips expand, your ribcage expands. It took a good nine months to put that weight on, so give yourself at least nine months to get it off and get your body back.Just ignore the excess weight for at least the first two weeks after birth. Honestly, the first two weeks of having an infant can be a nightmare. Its like boot camp, Ritchie says. For that time, focus on your baby, and dont worry about dieting.  AdvertisementAnd actually, you might want to wait six weeks or even longer before actively trying to lose the weight. Those entire first six weeks are a transitional period, Ritchie explains. It takes about that long for baby to adapt to the rhythms of the outside world, and for both baby and mom to get a hang of breastfeeding. You dont need the outside distraction of a rigid diet or exercise plan.Make savvy substitutionsThink before you snack. Instead of reaching for the Doritos, pop some popcorn. Instead of having packaged cereal, make a batch of steel-cut oatmeal. Oatmeal is a great breakfast for a breastfeeding mom whos trying to lose weight. It keeps you full for a long period of time and keeps insulin levels stable, Ritchie says.Starchy veggies, such as baked potatoes and sweet potatoes, can also satisfy your craving for carbs. Brown and wild rice are good side dish and snack options, too.Set yourself up for successA little bit of prep work one day can help you keep your eating on track for the next few days. Cut up some veggies and fruit to keep in the fridge, cook and freeze healthy meals for later quick defrosting, and dont feel bad about grabbing steam-in-bag veggies or other healthy low-prep snacks (there are lots of options at Trader Joes!). The idea is to keep healthy snacks and meals in the cabinet and fridge, and to keep out the Girl Scout cookies and chips, Ritchie says.Eat smaller, more frequent meals  AdvertisementIf a mom waits too long between meals, theres a hormonal effect that affects milk supply, Ritchie says. Her body will start pulling energy from her reserves, which decreases insulin production and affects thyroid hormone levels. That lowers prolactin, which is the hormone that controls how much milk we make. When youre feeling starving, youre more likely to eat something you know you shouldnt. Instead, spread your calories out over six mini-meals throughout the day.Cut calories  but not too muchIts perfectly safe to diet while breastfeeding, as long as your total caloric intake doesnt dip below 1,800 calories per day and you keep eating a wide variety of nutritious foods.Work in exerciseWait at least six to eight weeks before starting or restarting a serious exercise regimen. If youre planning a particularly strenuous workout, eat a healthy carb about a half-hour before you exercise. Eating a starchy vegetable, like half of a baked potato, before running can really help prevent a decrease in your milk supply, Ritchie says.Keep at itEveryone loses weight at a different rate, so dont be discouraged if your weight loss happens more slowly than it does for all those celeb mamas. With a healthy diet plan, breastfeeding moms typically lose about a pound a week, says Ritchie.The cool thing is, you can tailor your plan to your lifestyle and whether youd rather cut more calories or do more exercise. As long as youre burning more calories than youre consuming, youll lose weight, Ritchie says. So if a mom decides she wants to be able to eat the foods that she loves, she can add in some extra walks with the baby.

How Much Solid Food Should Baby Eat? Bonnie Vengrow ...,https://www.thebump.com/a/how-much-solids-to-feed-baby,"When you start feeding baby solids  usually around four to six months  start small. One to two ounces of food per meal is totally fine, says Satya Narisety, assistant professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Rutgers University. Follow babys cues. If hes showing hes not into it by keeping his lips closed or by turning away, hes had enough. Gradually increase the amount of food to about four ounces, three times a day by the end of his sixth month.At eight months, bump up the amount of solids to six to eight ounces per meal, three times a day, with two two-ounce snacks in between, Narisety says.Remember: Baby still gets most of his nutrition from breast milk or formula. If youre nursing, continue breastfeeding five to seven times a day (depending on how much baby takes in at each feeding  you'll have to follow his cues). If youre bottle-feeding, aim to give 24 ounces of milk in a 24-hour period by the time hes eight months of age.

Is My Newborn Eating Enough?,https://www.thebump.com/a/newborn-eating-enough,"""Having a newborn can be very overwhelming and it's common to worry about whether or not the baby is getting enough to eat,"" says Andi Silverman, breastfeeding expert and author of Mama Knows Breast: A Beginners Guide to Breastfeeding. ""Keep in mind that your pediatrician will check the baby's weight to make sure she is getting enough to eat. You can help, too, by keeping a journal of feedings, pees and poops. Newborns eat eight to twelve times per day, that is every two to three hours. So if you feed your baby from 8:00 a.m. to 8:20, the next feeding starts at 10:00 a.m. if you are on a two hour schedule. If you have a sleepy baby, you'll want to wake her up to make sure shes feeding. Newborns also poop three to four times a day, and pee five to eight times per day."" After about a month, feedings become less frequent  every three to four hours is common. ""Overall, try to feed your baby 'on demand,' or whenever she indicates shes hungry by crying, licking her lips, sucking her fist or rooting around for your breast.""There are some other things that can help you figure out if your baby is eating well: (1) you see milk in the babys mouth; (2) the baby eats, and then stops rooting for food; (3) your breasts feel softer after a feeding; (4) you feel your milk letting down, or a tingling in your breast during feeding; (5) you see the baby suck and swallow. Sucking is quick and shallow, swallowing is deep and rhythmic.

This time, we got the scoop fromShazi Visram, Founder and CEO of Happy Family.The Bump: Shazi, why did you start Happy Family?Shazi Visram: I saw an opportunity to change what children are eating. I thought you could give a baby a fresh start by providing whole foods that taste great and offer nutritional value. The concept was to create nutritious, organic super foods that parents could feel really good about giving their children, knowing they were giving them the very best. I started working on it about 10 years ago, when I was in business school, before I was a mom. I had a lot of friends who were parents that I consulted for advice and testing. Now, I have my own personal source of inspiration. My son is three and he can be a picky eater! So I struggle with a lot of the things that all moms do.TB: What are your top three pieces of advice for women looking to start their own business?SV: Make sure you're totally in love with and passionate about what you're doing. You're going to have to put in long, crazy hours, and a lot of heart and soul to make your dream a reality.Never give up. We all havegreat ideas that seem meaningful but they're even more powerful when you see your business as changing the world. Literally never, ever give up.  AdvertisementEnjoy the ride. For me, its been a roller coaster  a lot of stress, doubt and fear, but there have been exciting times too! Looking back, it's been a great learning experience. I appreciate challenges in retrospect and see how they helped me continue to grow.TB: What was your biggest challenge?SV: I think it was making sure we had enough capital and support behind our business while staying true to our original mission of purity and service. With every one of our products that you buy, a proceed helps a starving child in Africa. We wanted it to be something that changes the world. We also spend a lot of money on ingredients. It was important to offer functional, organic nutrition. We were the first baby food to supplement with probiotics, DHA and salba  one of the most nutritious baby foods on the planet. We wanted our foods to do something for a babys growing body. The other goal was to be accessible to everybody, not just children of parents with high incomes.To do all that and have a price point that's more accessible is tough. Ive been very lucky to find people who wanted to invest in that bigger vision knowing they'd get a financial return but not focusing on the bottom line as much as the triple bottom line. That's been a challenge and we've really overcome it.TB: Looking back, is there anything youd do differently?SV: No, I dont think so. I think if you can end the day thinking, I did very best I could today, you shouldn't have regrets. I'mproud of where its gone and the challenges I've overcome. There were times I was worried I wouldnt have enough money to pay my employees, or that I wouldnt have enough to buy groceries or take the subway home. But I appreciate that journey and it kept me humble. I do think I let the stress get to me physically, so the one thing I'd do differently is to have a better plan for stress management. I've had a couple herniated disks and muscular problems. I was so busy and frantic for a while that I didn't have time to focus on myself.  AdvertisementTB: Whats a typical day in your life like?SV: Its pretty crazy. My son, Zane, has autism and we've had a lot of late nights when he's up at 11 p.m. and 4:30 a.m. I have meetings and calls as early as 8 a.m. or even 7:30, and I tend to work until 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. I try to work from home a couple days a week be with him. It's a challenge to find balance because you want to be there for work. And I make sure every one of Zanes needs are met before mine. He's the most important thing in my life. So business can be draining and it's hard to keep it in balance, but at the end of night, I'm happy. That comes from celebrating all the little victories along the way.TB: Would you say that being a mother makes you a better businesswoman?SV: Absolutely. I think being a mom makes you more focused on whats important. Moms are very,very efficient. My efficiency levels have definitely risen. I focus on what I need to and I get it done.But also, being a CEO has made me better mom. Zane was diagnosed with autism a year ago. Before that, he was very happy and healthy and made every milestone, but around age two, he started regressing. I put together a group of doctors and experts to help him. Being a CEO gave me the skills to figure out who would make the best impact on his life. We set up meetings. We set goals and we make sure we're meeting them for him. I think running a business helps motherhood in that way. It's interesting to see the two coincide.  AdvertisementTB: And how important are moms to your business?SV: Very important! We employ 75 moms around the country as health and wellness ambassadors called Happy Mamas. They teach other parents how to cook baby food and host mommy and me yoga classes. They're really involved resources for new families for living healthy, happy lives. The products are just part of it  we want people to have all the information they need. These moms care about childrens nutrition and healthy living.Related Video"
Gestational Diabetes,http://www.thebump.com/a/gestational-diabetes,"What is gestational diabetes?Some women develop diabetes only during pregnancy; its called gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes is defined as glucose intolerance that is first diagnosed in pregnancy, and it occurs when pregnancy hormones affect how the body makes or uses insulin, which is a hormone that converts sugar in food into energy the body uses.If your body doesn't make enough insulin or if it doesn't use the insulin appropriately, the level of sugar in the blood rises to an unacceptable level. This is called hyperglycemia and means you have too much sugar in your blood. Occasionally, hormones made by the placenta can also hamper the actions of insulin, and gestational diabetes can occur. Several other factors can affect your glucose levels, including stress, the time of day (glucose values are often higher in the morning), the amount of exercise you do and the amount of carbohydrates in your diet.What are the signs of gestational diabetes?Symptoms of gestational diabetes include the following:[] Blurred vision[] Tingling or numbness in the hands and/or feet[] Excessive thirst[] Frequent urination[] Sores that heal slowly[] Excess fatigueAre there any tests for gestational diabetes?Yup! The glucose challenge screening test and glucose tolerance test involve testing your blood-glucose levels after you drink a sweet drink to see how well your body processes the sugar.How common is gestational diabetes?Gestational diabetes affects about 10 percent of all pregnancies. After pregnancy is over, nearly all women who experience this problem return to normal, and the problem disappears. However, if gestational diabetes occurs with one pregnancy, theres almost a 90 percent chance it will recur in subsequent pregnancies. In addition, studies show that 20 to 50 percent of those women who develop gestational diabetes may develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years.  AdvertisementHow did I get gestational diabetes? Gestational diabetes occurs for two reasons. One is the mother's body produces less insulin during pregnancy. The second is the mother's body can't use insulin effectively. Both situations result in high blood-sugar levels. Risk factors for developing gestational diabetes include:[] Over 30 years old[] Obesity[] Family history of diabetes[] Gestational diabetes in previous pregnancy[] Previously gave birth to a baby who weighed over 9.5 pounds[] Previously had a stillborn baby[] Black/African-American, Latina/Hispanic, Asian, Native American/Pacific IslanderA woman's weight when she was born may also be an indicator of her chances of developing gestational diabetes. One study showed that women who were in the bottom 10th percentile of weight when they were born were three to four times more likely to develop gestational diabetes during pregnancy.*How will my gestational diabetes affect my baby?*If left untreated, gestational diabetes can be serious health concern for you and your baby. Youll both be exposed to a high concentration of sugar, which isnt healthy for either of you. You might experience polyhydramnios (excessive amounts of amniotic fluid). This may cause premature labor if the uterus becomes overdistended.A woman with gestational diabetes may have a long labor because the excess sugar can cause baby to become quite large. Sometimes a baby cant fit through the birth canal, and a cesarean delivery is required.If your blood-sugar levels are high, you may experience more infections during pregnancy. The most common infections include those in the kidneys, bladder, cervix and uterus.  AdvertisementWhats the best way to treat gestational diabetes?Good control of gestational diabetes is important during pregnancy. Treatment of gestational diabetes includes regular exercise and increased fluid intake. Diet is essential in handling this problem. Your doctor will probably recommend a six-meal, 2,000- to 2,500-calorie-per-day eating plan. You may also be referred to a dietitian. Research shows that women who receive dietary counseling, blood-sugar monitoring and insulin therapy (when needed) do better during pregnancy than women who receive routine care. Many experts believe that glyburide, an oral hypoglycemic agent used to treat type 2 diabetes, is a good alternative to insulin, and just as effective, in treating women with gestational diabetes.In a 2014 study, researchers at the Division of Research at Kaiser Permanente Northern California found that women with a history of gestational diabetes were at higher risk of developing early heart disease after pregnancy. So speak to your doctor about how your condition may affect your future health, and what lifestyle and treatment choices you should be making longterm.What can I do to prevent gestational diabetes?Maybe nothing. Its unknown exactly what causes gestational diabetes, but it might be a result of hormones blocking the insulin in your body. Maintaining a healthy weight before your pregnancy can help lower your risk.What do other pregnant moms do when they have gestational diabetes?I had [GD] with my first, who was 6 pounds, 12 ounces, at birth, and now I have it again with my second. I was terrified the first time around. If you eat healthy and keep your blood-glucose levels where they need to be, you and your baby should be fine.  AdvertisementThe worst part is remembering to prick your finger after you eat...and when you get major cravings, you cant indulge. But you can still snack healthily  PB&J and peanut butter and apples became staples for me!I thought the diagnosis was going to stop me from having the type of birth experience I wanted, but it didnt.

Eat More Fish During Pregnancy?,https://www.thebump.com/a/eat-more-fish-during-pregnancy,"For years, the FDA has warned that pregnant women should limit intake of fish to 12 ounces per week, in an attempt to limit exposure to mercury. But are these concerns unfounded (and maybe even unhealthy)?Alarge coalition of scientists, medical organizations, and doctors (including our own expert, Ashley Roman, MD) is now urging women to eat at least the FDA's recommended amount, if not more. They say that the Omega-3s in fish are especially important for the second-half of pregnancy, when baby's nervous system is developing, and that women should be urged to eat more fish.The FDA isn't currently prepared to revise its recommendation (but they do plan to study the new information).So what's a pregnant lady to do? Talk to your doctor, and check out the info we found below to help with your decision:According to our expert, Ashley Roman, MD:""To date, there is not a single case of fetal toxicity linked directly to fish intake..."" The FDA says:-""...high levels of mercury in the bloodstream of unborn babies and young children may harm the developing nervous system...""-""Do not eat Shark, Swordfish, King Mackerel, or Tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury.""-""Eat up to 12 ounces (two average meals) a week of a variety of fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury.""-""Fish and shellfish contain high-quality protein and other essential nutrients, are low in saturated fat, and contain omega-3 fatty acids. A well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fish and shellfish can contribute to heart health and children's proper growth and development.""  AdvertisementThe National Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition says:-""Recent studies indicate that the nutritional benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy greatly outweigh potential risks from trace methyl mercury consumption."" -""Oily ocean fish are...an important source of the mineral selenium, which is essential for thyroid function and anti-oxidation. There is a growing body of evidence that selenium in ocean fish may also counteract potential negative influence of mercury exposure. While a nutritional deficiency from insufficient seafood consumption (long-chain omega-3 fatty acids) is quite common, the risk of mercury toxicity is exceedingly rare.""A study at the Medical University of South Carolina in 2007 found that:- The FDA warning has led 56% of pregnant women to cut too much fish from their diet. A British study published earlyin 2007in The Lancet indicates that:- Women who eat more fish while pregnant may bear children with higher IQs. **Also important to note: Different fish have different levels of mercury.

Exercising While Pregnant,https://www.thebump.com/a/exercising-while-pregnant,"Youve probably heard that pregnancy and labor and delivery will be easier if youre in good shape, but your first trimester isnt the time to start a whole new workout routine. If you already work out regularly, its usually okay to keep up with whatever you're doing through your first trimester, but be sure to check with your doctor to make sure. If you haven't been hitting the gym much lately you'll want to ease into it. The best exercise regimen for the first trimester? Walking and stretching on a daily basis. Heres why a low-impact routine is the way to go:1. During pregnancy, your blood volume increases by a whopping 50 percent. As a result of all this extra blood circulating in your body, your heart rate is highereven at restand exercise may feel more difficult, especially in the first trimester. This additional blood volume also causes you to take deeper, faster breaths and lowers your blood pressure.2. Cardiac output also increases. In fact, its 30 to 40 percent higher than it was before you got pregnant. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, you can safely engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days. Walking, swimming, riding a stationary bike, using an elliptical and low-impact aerobics are perfect cardio options as your pregnancy progresses, since these activities don't put any pressure on your joints, loose ligaments or pelvic floor. Listen to your body and make sure your rate of perceived exertion (RPE) is around 7. Try the talk test: If you cannot hold a conversation while exercising, you're working out too hard and need to slow down or lower the intensity to bring your RPE down.  Advertisement3. Your heart rate will be much higher than before you were pregnant, so its important that you give yourself plenty of time to cool down. It can take up to 15 minutes. Stop exercising if and when you start feeling tired and never work yourself to exhaustion.Need more direction? Try this pregnancy DVD from Tracey Mallett. PHOTO:Getty ImagesRelated Video"

The problem is that milk also contains calories, and, in some cases, fat  and some kids drink so much milk that they fail to eat other foods and nutrients. Kids can overdo it with milk and get anemic, says Michael Lee, MD, a pediatrician at Childrens Medical Center in Dallas. In our population, we have a lot of kids with iron deficiency, and a lot of them are power milk drinkers.So keep a close eye on the milk carton. Try serving water with meals and offering milk with snacks, or vice versa. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends toddlers between the ages of one and two drink breast milk, whole milk or 2 percent milk. (2 percent milk is recommended for toddlers who are at risk of becoming overweight.) After age two, transition your child to skim or 1 percent milk, which offers similar nutrition in fewer calories.Plus, more from The Bump:How Can I Get My Toddler to Drink More Water?

How to stop breastfeeding,https://www.thebump.com/a/how-to-stop-breastfeeding,"Breastfeeding baby is a personal decision. Deciding when to stop breastfeeding is just as personal, and both decisions are entirely up to you.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first 6 months of life and that nursing should continue until baby is 1 year old (with complementary solids added to the mix at 6 months). After that, the AAP recommends nursing baby for as long as you (and baby) want. There is no correct time for a child to wean, says Natasha K. Sriraman, MD, associate professor of pediatrics at the Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, Virginia. Just be sure to do it at a time thats right for you and your child. When youre ready, heres how to make the transition as easy and pain-free as possible.What is weaning?You actually start the weaning process the first time you offer baby any sustenance beyond breast milk. Essentially, weaning prepares your mind, body and baby for an inevitable end to nursingit sparks a hormonal shift in your body that causes your milk to go away. When you decide its time to stop breastfeeding, thats your cue to start weaning.Weaning can take several weeks or months and should be done as slowly as your situation permits, Sriraman says. (Also, weaning doesnt have to be an all-or-none process. You can do partial weaning if, say, youre returning to work but still want to nurse before and after your work day.) No matter how long it takes, know that during the weaning process, your breast milk changes to accommodate babys shifting nutritional needs. Even when the volume of your breast milk is decreasing, an appropriate level of nutrients remains present, and immunological protection is not compromised, Sriraman says.  AdvertisementDeciding when to stop breastfeedingDespite the AAPs recommendation, many moms dont breastfeed until the 1-year mark. It can be difficult for many mothers to reach the 1-year milestone because of obstacles such as returning to work and poor pumping, lactation and even societal support, says nurse practitioner and lactation consultant, Kathleen F. McCue, DNP, FNP-BC, IBCLC-RLC, owner of Metropolitan Breastfeeding in Bethesda, Maryland.If you stop nursing before the 12-month mark, you must replace breastmilk with formula. While complementary solid foods are a good source of calories for babies around 6 months and older, its not enough nutrition for those under a year old, McCue says. If youve made it to a year, congratulationstheres no need for a formula-like replacement, and youre free to transition baby to cows milk (two to two and a half cups of whole milk daily).How to stop breastfeedingThere is no one-method-fits-all style to phasing out breastfeeding. But here are some universal tips that can help you and baby better adjust to this change:If baby takes a bottle (whether with pumped breast milk or formula), youve already begun the weaning process. If your infant is already accepting bottles, then shell usually do well when you gradually decrease the length or frequency of nursing sessions and replace it with a bottle, says Stephanie Nguyen, RN, IBCLC, a board-certified lactation consultant and founder of Modern Milk, a breastfeeding clinic and prenatal-postnatal education center in Scottsdale, Arizona.If baby hasnt had a bottle yet, introducing it is a necessary step. If this is babys first go at a bottle, youll likely need a little help. Sriraman suggests having your partner, your caregiver or another family member first offer baby a bottle without you present. Sometimes, Mom and her scent triggers babys urge to nurse, she says. Dont worry too much: Eventually, baby will learn to take the bottle from you too.  AdvertisementIf you plan to pump breast milk, reduce those sessions by just a few minutes each day, McCue says. Same goes for nursing: Trim sessions daily until you can remove one entire breast milk feeding. The middle-of-the-day feed is usually the easiest to eliminate. (Remember, for babies 12 months and younger, the breast milk thats phased out must be replaced by formula.)Your body will naturally produce less and less breast milk as you reduce your nursing sessions. In terms of how to stop breastfeeding without pain, this gradual approach helps keep most discomfort at bay. But there may still be some engorgement and pain even when weaning is spread out. Use ice packs and take Ibuprofen to help ease the pain, Nguyen says. You can also express a small amount of each breast to help alleviate the engorgementjust enough to make you feel more comfortable.Side effects of weaning abruptlyIts never a good idea to stop breastfeeding cold turkey. Instead, a slow and steady wean is best for mom and baby. Heres what happens if you go too fast:Youll endure painful, engorged breastsMost of the time, pain is experienced during weaning when your breasts become engorgedsimilar to when breastfeeding began, McCue says. This can lead to many problems related to the milk not being removed from the breast. For instance, milk can back up into the ducts, causing a painful plug or clog, which can then get infected. That infection may lead to mastitis or an abscess.It takes an emotional tollWeaning is often a bittersweet time for mother and child, as bonding time shifts from the nursing connection to other outlets, McCue says. Its important for you to be gentle with yourself and baby as you go through the weaning processand take it slow. In short: a quick stop is stressful for both of you.  AdvertisementWhen an abrupt end to nursing is neededWhile weaning slowly is always preferred, sometimes you have to stop breastfeeding suddenly because of illness or other unforeseen circumstances. If this happens, turn to your physician or lactation consultant for guidance. Birth control pills, pseudoephedrine, peppermint tea and sage all can help reduce milk supply and help with the weaning process, Nguyen says. You may also consider hand expression or using a breast pump to express enough milk to keep you comfortable as your body adjusts.When baby wants to stop nursingAs baby grows and changes, her approach to nursing shifts too. Does that mean baby is trying to wean? Heres what you need to know.Confusing signs your infant wants stop nursingIn all honesty, most babies do not self-wean before the age of 1, Nguyen says. Instead, what you are likely noticing is some normal developmental milestones. For instance, when baby starts to cut teeth, she may fuss at the breast because shes trying to avoid hitting sore spots on her gums. Its also very natural for babies to become distracted while nursing as they grow and become more aware, Nguyen says. This doesnt necessarily mean she wants to stop. It may simply mean that you need a quieter locale to nurse.When food prompts weaningMost babies start eating solid foods around 6 to 12 months. While this in no way should elbow nursing out of the picture, it can complicate matters. If baby is offered too much solid food, she may fill up on and not want to nurse, Nguyen says. To curb this, try timing your breastfeeding sessions further away from babys solids-filled mealtime and establishing a routine schedule for mealtimes.   AdvertisementClues your toddler is ready to weanWeaning after the age of 1 usually occurs when baby is ready developmentally and emotionally, Nguyen says. Hints that shes ready: Your child can drink well from a cup, gets the majority of her nutrition from solid food and distraction-while-nursing is ever increasing. Most babies will self-wean between the ages of 18 months and 3 years, depending upon the circumstances, Nguyen says. (A child who is self-weaning will almost always cut down on nursing very gradually over a period of months, one feed at a time, leaving the nighttime session for last, Sriraman adds.)Comforting a weaning babySaying good-bye to this stage of motherhood can be toughfor you and for baby. Good thing there are ways to make it easier. Heres how:Continue cuddlesDuring the weaning process, your child will likely miss the bonding and closeness that nursing offers (and so will you!), so its important to offer lots of cuddles, hugs and kisses to help make up for the decreased physical contact, Sriraman says.Find a substituteIf baby is over 1 year old, try to find a breast milk stand-in that she enjoys, like warm milk sweetened with a bit of honey and cinnamon, Nguyen says. Whatever the replacement is, as long as its healthy and baby views it as something special, it can help ease the transition.Bring on the distractionWhen phasing out a nursing session, its a good idea to use that nursing time for an activity baby enjoys. Get out a special game or toy, or change up your environment by going on a walk or heading to the park, Nguyen says. This makes the time feel like a gain as opposed to a loss.

Prenatal Vitamins: What You Need To Know,https://www.thebump.com/a/prenatal-vitamins-what-you-need-to-know,"For years, OBs have routinely given pregnant women prescriptions for specialized prenatal vitamins at their first prenatal visit. Now, more and more doctors are advising women to pump up their supplements even before they conceive. And with some prenatal vitamin formulas now available without a prescription, thats easier than ever to do. But what to take?Women of childbearing age should be sure to get enough folic acid, iron, and calciumthree essential nutrients for keeping a woman and her developing baby healthy, advises Siobhan Dolan, MD, MPH, Associate Professor of Clinical Obstetrics & Gynecology and Women's Health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Dont wait for your doctor to give you a prescription [for prenatal vitamins] at your first prenatal visit; start taking them at least one month before you get pregnant.The catch: Who knows when its one month before youll get pregnant?The nutrients you needTurns out you may be able to get whats most crucial for the development of a healthy baby from a regular one-a-day multivitamin. According to the March of Dimes, a non-profit group that works to prevent birth defects, taking 400 micrograms of folic acid every day in addition to what you get in a balanced diet, before and just after conception, can prevent up to 70 percent of neural tube defects (problems with the developing babys brain or spine that can be devastating). That amount is found in many one-a-day multivitamin/mineral formulas, especially in those designed for women.During pregnancy, you also may need more iron and calcium; and since you probably wont know youre pregnant for the earliest weeks, its a good idea to start boosting your intake of both these minerals as soon as you start trying. For iron, the recommended intake for adult women is 18 milligrams per day, and thats what youll find in most multivitamins. Pregnant women need more27 milligrams dailyand thats typically the threshold for prenatal formulas.  AdvertisementWhen it comes to calcium, even prescription supplements often dont match up to the levels of calcium that nutrition experts recommend for women approaching childbearing age, which is 1000 milligrams each day. That level of calcium makes a multivitamin pill too large. Taking a separate calcium supplement is one option, as is taking an over-the-counter prenatal formula, which sometimes has more calcium than the prescription versions. And women should be sure to get plenty of calcium in their diets, from dairy products and leafy greens.Experiment with formulasYou may have to try several formulas before you find one you like. Some may upset your stomach (particularly formulas high in iron). Others may be too large to swallow easily.Theres no standardization in prenatal formulas. Manufacturers can choose whether to make their product available with or without a prescription. They can include longer or shorter lists of vitamins and minerals, and even herbs. Theres no consistency in the list or amount of ingredients from brand to brand. Because the preparations can vary so much, its up to you to be informed: read the labels, talk to your doctor and pharmacist, and choose the best pill for you. The right one will depend on your diet, your tolerance for different pills, and whether or not your insurance covers prescription pills (if it does, they may be the least expensive option).If you choose an over-the-counter brand, the March of Dimes recommends looking for USP on the labelthat indicates that the vitamins have been given a stamp of approval from the U.S. Pharmacopeia, an organization that checks safety and quality. Read labels carefully. You may find that the once-a-day multivitamin youre already taking contains the vitamins and minerals you need right now.Related Video"
Can A Mediterranean Diet Boost Your Pregnancy Odds?,https://www.thebump.com/a/eating-a-mediterranean-diet-could-help-you-get-pregnant,"Women who follow a Mediterranean-style diet high in vegetables, vegetable oils, fish and beans are more likely to increase their chances of getting pregnant, according to dietitians at Loyola University Health System.You hear that, ladies? Dietitians want you to eat more like a Greek  and to that, we say: BRING. ON. THE. FETA.Brooke Schantz, who was involved in the study, says: ""Establishing a healthy eating pattern and weight is a good first step for women who are looking to conceive. Not only will a healthy diet and lifestyle potentially help with fertility, but it also may influence fetal well-being and reduce the risk of complications during pregnancy."" And according to the National Infertility Association, more than 30 percent of infertility is due to the fact that women are over, or under, weight. The two weight extremes actually cause a shift in hormones that likely affect ovulation.So, now for what you didn't know. Schantz and her team of researchers said that you can follow a few tasty nutritional tips in the kitchen and when you're dining out to help boost your chances of conception. As for what to eat, you should:Reduce your intake of animal proteins and add more vegetable proteins to your dietThink: less red meat, more asparagus, cauliflower, brussel sprouts, artichokes, sweetcorn and watercress. And if you're thinking like a true Greek, more vegetable proteins means more feta and a few extra grape leaves.Cut back on the foods with trans- and saturated fats and increase monounsaturated fatsUh, dictionary, please? Let's cut to the chase: Start saying ""no"" more often to these foods: fast foods, frozen foods, packaged foods, spreadable foods, toppings, dips, baked goods (like cookies. Sigh), candies, chips, crackers and soups (ugh!). And start saying ""yes"" to more avocados, peanut butter, nuts and olives (yes, yes, yes and yes!). And skip the canola oil  go straight for olive oil. Rachael Ray, and your future baby, will thank you.  AdvertisementGet more fiberIt may hurt your belly at first, but taking in more whole grains, vegetables and fruit will do wonders for your reproductive parts. And, no, to disappoint, feta is not loaded with fiber. But when no one's watching, eat the damn feta.Even if you're not vegetarian, get more creative with your iron optionsMeat eaters, please don't think you've got to cut the animal-derived dishes completely. You can have your deer and eat it too, but do try to add a variety of iron options to your weekly menu. Start shopping for things like tofu, seeds, whole grains, nuts and more legumes. And if you made a face at tofu, allow me: It tastes like whatever you cook it in. It truly is the chameleon of foods.Consume high-fat dairy instead of low-fat dairyHaving to choose one dairy option over the other does, I admit, bring me great pangs of sadness, but there's (always) a silver lining when it comes to cheese. Look for dairy-products that are full-fat cheeses, cream, sour cream, whole milk, two percent milk and ice cream. And, without further ado... feta! But don't make it your life's work to eat all the full-fat cheeses. This is about making your diet work, not clogging your arteries.Start taking a multivitaminHit the pavement and check out the options at your local wellness store, a GNC or a Vitamin Shoppe. The staff on-hand will help you make a purchase that gives your body just want you need.Related Video"
Twin Fetal Growth?,https://www.thebump.com/a/twin-fetal-growth,"With single babies, an OB can whip out a tape measure and determine a babys growth just by looking at the size of your uterus. But when theres more than one baby involved, its more difficult to estimate how much nutrition each one is getting. Thats why most moms of multiples get frequent ultrasounds, which are the most accurate way to make sure everyone is doing fine. Most of the time, your tots will be growing at similar, although not identical, rates. Doctors like to see them stay within about 20 percent of each others weight. Some twins do develop fetal growth restriction, a complication where one baby gains too little weight compared with his sibling with the norm. But the good thing is, your doctor is likely to be on top of your babies development throughout the pregnancy, so you can address any problems if they should arise.Plus more from The Bump:Nonstress test for multiples?Could the twin ultrasound be wrong?Two sets of identical twins?Related Video"
