 Classic vs. Modern Formulas,http://www.parenting.com/article/classic-vs-modern-formulas,"A guide to baby formulaThe other day I was looking at the feeding instructions my mother was given when I was a newborn sixty-four years ago. She was advised to begin feeding me cereal at just three weeks of age. We know so much more about infant nutrition now, and we understand that an infant's gastrointestinal tract matures much slower than was once thought. My mother would not receive that same recommendation today, because we now understand that a baby's gastrointestinal tract is not mature enough to tolerate solids well until around six months.The infant formulas of today really are much better than they were in the days when they were composed of evaporated milk and syrup. Today's formulas are nutritionally superior to the homemade ones you mentioned. They contain better amounts of added iron, vitamins, minerals, and essential fats. And since the passage of the Infant Formula Act in 1985, formula safety is tightly regulated by the FDA.Your concern that parents of today change formulas a lot is a valid one. In my experience, often it's not the formula that causes baby to be upset, it's the method of feeding. Many parents give their babies too much formula in one feeding. For many babies, their intestinal enzymes are not mature enough to quickly digest a whole big bottle of formula. All that undigested formula can cause constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. Before changing formulas, it's better to try decreasing the volume and increasing the frequency of the feedings. Here's Dr. Bill's rule of thumb for feeding babies with intestinal upsets: ""Feed baby half as much, twice as often.""But the best advance in infant nutrition lately is that more and more mothers are breastfeeding. In the days of evaporated milk formula, only around twenty percent of mothers breastfed their infants. Nowadays, in some areas of the country (especially the East and West coasts), a large percent of mothers leave the hospital breastfeeding their babies. Even though today's infant formulas are nutritionally superior to those of many decades ago, mother's milk will always remain the nutritional gold standard for babies.If you still suspect your baby needs a change of formula, you want to make sure your choosing the right formula for your child. A good baby formula should be:"
 The Breast vs. Bottle Poll,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-breast-vs-bottle-poll,"""How dare these self-righteous mothers get on their soapbox and tell me that I am not bonding with my <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">children</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> unless I pull my boob out in front of the world and breastfeed? Not everyone wishes to see your stretch-marked boobs in public!""<br><i> -- A formula-feeding mom from Baton Rouge, Louisiana</i></br>""<i>Babytalk</i> states that breast milk is best for a baby, then says that no mother should feel pressured into choosing one method. Does this mean we shouldn't feel pressured to eat nutritiously when we're pregnant? Or to quit smoking? The truth is, if more women felt pressured to breastfeed, babies would benefit.""<br><i> -- A breastfeeding mom from Oswego, New York</i></br>These are just two of the countless letters <i>Babytalk</i> has received over the years in response to virtually anything we print on the subjects of breastfeeding or formula-feeding. We couldn't help but wonder: Do all new mothers feel critical of women who feed their children differently, or do we only hear from a vocal few? To find out, we launched a national survey that garnered more than 36,000 responses, some of which met our expectations, butmost of which decidedly did not. Here are the eye-opening findings from <i>Babytalk</i>'s 2001 Breast vs. Bottle Survey.Our breastfeeding respondents came down pretty hard on moms who formula-feed. On the surface, they say they support women who decide to formula-feed  -- that these women ""made the choice that best suits them"" (75%). But almost three-quarters of them turn around and say that formula-feeders are outright ""depriving their children of good health.""""There is ignorance on the part of women who formula-feed,"" says Marcelle Kinney of Valkaria, Florida. ""If you know the benefits, how could you not breastfeed?"" Two-thirds of our breastfeeding respondents told us they felt ""sorry for the children"" of formula-feeders. And more than four in ten believe that formula-feeders ""couldn't be bothered to learn how"" to breastfeed. ""With all that we know about the benefits of breastfeeding,"" writes Scarlett Martin of Nashville, Tennessee, ""I do not understand why so few women are willing to try and why even fewer are willing to try hard enough."" A full third tell us that formula-feeders are ""selfish and lazy,"" and one in five say that formula-feeders are ""a little nuts""! ""We need more breastfeeding information and less formula garbage,"" writes Willmar, Minnesota, mom Jackie Sawicki. ""Breast is best! Formula is never, never best for a baby!""This was the first surprise the survey had in store for us. Breastfeeders openly admit that they judge formula-feeders, but apparently the criticism just doesn't register. Less than 20 percent of the formula-feeders felt that breastfeeders were ""self-righteous."" And more importantly, the vast majority of them (63%) say they've never been criticized for their feeding choice by a breastfeeder! Of the small group of formula-feeders who say they have been criticized, about half felt ""angry"" (56%) or ""frustrated"" (54%)  -- but the other half said they just ""didn't care"" (51%), that the criticism rolled right off of them! ""Abreastfeeding friend at my high school reunion just wouldn't let up on me,"" says White Plains, New York, mom Lizanne O'Toole, who formula-feeds her daughter. ""But I never felt bad about it.""The formula-feeders' live-and-let-live, carefree attitude also prevails when it comes to their support of women who breastfeed: An overwhelming majority (92%) say that breastfeeders ""made the choice that best suits them."" ""I believe women who breastfeed are doing the very best they believe they can for their children,"" writes formula-feeding mom Heather Topcik of Beaufort, South Carolina. Did breastfeeding moms give up too much of their time for their children, we asked? No, said 92 percent of the formula-feeding moms. Were breastfeeding moms less busy than they were themselves? No again, said two-thirds of the formula-feeders. In fact, a third went so far as to say that breastfeeders were ""admirable"" and that they were ""a littlejealous"" of them.Here's where things get really interesting: An astonishing 83 percent of breastfeeders say they have been criticized by a formula-feeder! How to explain this huge disconnect? Was one of the groups lying? When we dove into the long, passionate letters sent by many of our respondents, the picture immediately became clear.The criticism, the breastfeeders told us, is often so subtle that the formula-feeders don't even realize they are doing it. It's the look a woman may shoot a friend who prepares to nurse at playgroup or in the park  -- a look that instantly conveys disapproval and embarrassment. It's the tone of voice a mom may use when her friend is still breastfeeding after 12 months, or six, or even three. ""You're still doing that?"" a Mount Kisco, New York, mom says she heard from people close to her  -- the ""that""telegraphing not just surprise, but ""more than a tinge of distaste."" Sadly, breastfeeders say they experience these kinds of looks and remarks all the time.But the trouble is, it's not just formula-feeding moms who are judging breastfeeding moms. In fact, breastfeeders feel criticism from just about every corner of society. We at <i>Babytalk</i> thought that because the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends a full year of breastfeeding  -- and even formula advertisements say ""breast is best""  -- there was a wide net of support for breastfeeding women in America. But nothing could be further from the truth. Here are the alarming facts reported by our breastfeeding respondents:<span class=""blue10b"">* Close family members  -- including husbands  -- often actively discourage breastfeeding.</span> ""My family was not supportive of breastfeeding,"" says Springfield, Ohio, mom Julie Nourse. ""I was constantly asked when I was going to quit."" Some breastfeeders heard criticism from those they turned to for advice: ""My husband's aunt told me that you only nursed your baby if you couldn't afford formula,"" says Danyell Rager of Gambier, Ohio. And still others heard it from the spouse they counted on to support them no matter what. ""My husband would probably have preferred that I formula-feed our children,"" writes Sherry Kennedy of Vandenberg Village, California. ""Most women probably give in to their husband's wishes; I did not."" Husbands, the women tell us, disapprove of breastfeeding for two reasons: They fear that it will mean a change in their sexual relationship with their wife, and they fear being left out of the mother-baby dyad that forms with exclusive breastfeeding.<span class=""blue10b"">* Many think breastfeeding is gross.</span> ""I know people who think breastfeeding is disgusting,"" writes Lackawaxen, Pennsylvania, mom Deborah Seid. Cincinnati mom Jill Eysoldt remembers a friend looking at her ""like I was some pre-civilized cave woman. She said breastfeeding was so gross, and she couldn't believe people did that."" (Again ""that""  -- as if people can't even bring themselves to say the word ""breastfeed""!)<span class=""blue10b"">* Public breastfeeding is still not accepted.</span> ""Even though it is the most natural thing, it's socially unacceptable to nurse a baby or toddler in public,"" writes breastfeeding mom Rita Ester of Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Breastfeeders tell us they've had people stare at them and give them dirty looks when they nurse in public, forcing them to cover themselves and their baby with blankets or coats or turn their back to those around them  -- even when they were with friends. But perhaps the saddest and most telling story is the one we heard from a New Jersey reader who, after nursing her baby in a restaurant, was approached by another female patron. ""I wouldn't change my baby's diaper in public,"" sniffed the other woman, ""so why would you do that?"" Yes, ""that""again  -- in this context, telling us that some people think of breast milk as being akin to bodily waste.<span class=""blue10b"">* Working moms who breastfeed get little support from their employers.</span> ""When it came to accommodating my desire to pump at the office, my company installed a plug in the handicapped bathroom for me,"" writes Jennifer Tickell of Houston, Texas. ""My desire to continue breastfeeding was strong enough for me to ignore that I had to walk to the bathroom through a room full of men with my Medela case in hand."" We also heard from moms who've been reduced to pumping in taxis on the way to business meetings and women who pump in the car on the way to work, trying to focus on the road while hoping their fellow commuters won't notice. ""I told a friend how busy I was traveling for work and trying to manage breastfeeding and pumping,"" says a breastfeeding mom in New York City, ""and she responded with 'You are crazy. Why don't you just stop that nonsense already?' Some friend, huh?"" And Kay LaRosa of Springfield, Illinois, says, ""I've heard of people who had to pump in the janitor's closet at their office  -- and had the janitor walk in!""<span class=""blue10b"">* Americans are extremely intolerant of long-term breastfeeding.</span> Despite studies that have shown long-term breastfeeding to be beneficial to both mother and child, it's too often looked at as aberrant behavior. ""After a couple of months, it's time to wean,"" states formula-feeding mom Christina Rohrer of East Petersburg, Pennsylvania. Marcelle Kinney says that people are ""shocked"" that she's still breastfeeding her 17-month-old. As Jill Eysoldt, who breastfed her child for 18 months, says, long-term breastfeeding moms are almost seen as perverts. ""Someone once said to me that breastfeeding after a year is more for the mom's enjoyment than for the child's benefit,"" she says.<span class=""blue10b"">* Even some health-care providers aren't encouraging breastfeeders to persevere.</span> Though we believe that most doctors support breastfeeding, some, we learned, clearly do not. One mom told us of an emergency room physician treating her for a urinary tract infection who got angry when he had to find an antibiotic that was compatible with breastfeeding. ""My son was only seven months old, and this doctor wanted to know why I hadn't weaned him yet,"" she writes.What's going on here is patently clear. Support for breastfeeding exists in an ivory tower, and it is years, perhaps even decades, away from reaching the grass roots. Breastfeeding women feel they are in a distinct, downtrodden minority  -- and they are right. According to the 1999 Mothers Survey conducted by formula manufacturer Ross Products Division, Abbot Laboratories, only 30 percent of women are still breastfeeding by the time their baby is 6 months old. Because breastfeeding is not the norm, and has not been for many years, deep veins of prejudice and disapproval surround it.""Breastfeeding isn't right for me,"" said 87 percent of the formula-feeders. Why? The number one reason: ""inconvenience"" (65%). These moms had to go back to work, where breastfeeding was difficult if not impossible. ""We own a business and I don't know when I would have had time [to breastfeed],"" says Lenox, Iowa, mom Courtney Brown, who, like many women, realized she wouldn't be in a breastfeeding-friendly environment once her baby was born. ""I did not breastfeed my first child because people were not supportive and I had to go back to work after eight weeks,"" says Karly McCutchan of Dumas, Texas. Most women receive a maternity leave of only six to eight weeks, barely enough time to learn how to breastfeed and become comfortable with it.Another big reason breastfeeding isn't right for many women: modesty. ""I did not feel comfortable breastfeeding,"" says Christina Rohrer. ""It was a modesty issue for me."" Writes Heather Topcik: ""The prospect of breastfeeding made me nervous and uncomfortable. I knew right away that I did not want to do it.""A full three-quarters of these moms say that formula is ""just as good as breast milk."" ""I was formula-fed, and my husband was formula-fed, and we turned out fine,"" says Anne Scholl of Richmond Hill, New York. These moms also tell us that formula-feeding has many benefits of its own. Ninety-four percent are glad that their spouse can share feeding responsibilities, 62 percent are happy they can get some sleep at night, and 49 percent feel like they ""finally have their body back.""Formula-feeding moms aren't ignorant; they know breast milk is best. ""My husband is a doctor and I was a health major in college, so I know all the good things about breastfeeding,"" says O'Toole. ""But I simply had no desire to do it."" Forty percent of the women do worry about the health benefits their babies may be missing out on, but as a group, the formula-feeders are largely content. They know that the quality of today's formula is excellent, and they are joined in their decision by the majority of moms in America. They don't need to confront disapproving husbands or overcome their own feelings of modesty. They don't need to barnstorm social barriers every day, as their breastfeeding sisters do. We at <i>Babytalk</i> thought we would see a good deal of conflict and guilt among women who formula-feed, but the data simply didn't support that expectation.It takes great courage and commitment to persevere with breastfeeding. It may also take a level of support unavailable to most American women. In what was virtually the only demographic difference between the groups of women we polled, the breastfeeders' household income was significantly higher than the formula-feeders' ($54,800 as compared to $46,700; see sidebar at left). This indicates that the breastfeeders may more often have the luxury of staying home with their children, or that their jobs are more professional and thus more conducive to pumping (just think of the difference between an office with a door andthe janitor's closet). With such low support for breastfeeding at home, at work, and out in the world, formula-feeders cannot be blamed for making the perfectly reasonable choice they do.""Breastfeeding is still taboo,"" writes one breastfeeder. ""Women are made to feel ashamed of their bodies and breasts."" We as a nation must overcome the puerile notion that a woman's breast is more of a sexual object than a lifegiving force. And we must support every woman's prerogative to make the feeding choice  -- breast, bottle, or both  -- that is right for her and herbaby.""Breastfeeding or formula-feeding  -- it is not always an absolute choice,"" writes Friendsville, Tennessee, mom Karen Anderson. She is among a growing group of moms who ""do the combo""  -- feeding their baby both breast milk and formula during the first 6 months of life. Seven out of ten combo moms say they do it because they ""wanted to formula-feed and give their baby the health benefits of breast milk."" In fact, 74 percent of them say they ""have the best of both worlds."" ""My son went back and forth from breast to bottle beautifully from day one,"" writes Allison Lansdowne of Gainesville, Florida. ""It was so convenient.""But a large group of combo moms were eager to let us know that formula supplementation wasn't their original plan. A full 50 percent say they are ""disappointed that they couldn't breastfeed exclusively,"" with two out of five admitting that they wanted to breastfeed their baby from the start but were faced with complications that made exclusive nursing close to impossible. Sixty-one percent of combo moms say they admire women who breastfeed exclusively and are even a little jealous. ""I got very depressed, to think that I couldn't give my child the health benefits that breast milk has,"" writes Lima, Ohio, mom Amie Green, who had to stop trying to breastfeed exclusively when she was diagnosed with an insufficient milk supply (a condition that affects about five percent of women). ""It is embarrassing to admit that I can't do something that is supposed to be a naturalthing for a woman to do.""Most of these moms (70%) say they have not been criticized for their feeding choice by a fellow mom. But the ones who have been are more upset than any other group of moms. Unlike the full-time formula-feeders, who ""didn't care"" when someone gave them a hard time, the combo moms were angered (74%), frustrated (72%), and hurt (63%) by their critics. ""I did exactly what I thought was best for my baby,"" writes Melissa Peterson of Fountain Valley, California. ""However, I found myself explaining why I was formula-feeding, as if I needed to explain that I was not a bad mom and that we had tried breastfeeding.""The good news is that the vast majority of combo moms arethrilled with the way their feeding method has worked out.Eighty-nine percent are glad they could give their baby thehealth benefits of breast milk, 83 percent are happy their spouse could share feedings, and 73 percent are glad they have some control over their life. ""The stress and pressure of pumping milk so I could go to work was off,"" says East Windsor, New Jersey, mom Patricia De Cristofaro. ""My husband and I could leave the baby with our parents and actually have some 'he and she' time. It's been great!"""
 Formula 411,http://www.parenting.com/article/formula-411,"Milk or soy? Brand name or generic? To add or not to add DHA and ARA? These are just a few of the decisions facing you if you've decided to formula-feed your baby. It's reassuring to know that all formulas on the market have met an acceptable level of nutrition for infants. But beyond that, there are many distinctions. Here, a guide to <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">help</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> you select the best one for your baby (always check with your pediatrician before switching formulas):This is a must for any formula. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using iron-fortified formulas until a baby is 12 months old, because some infants don't have enough natural reserves of the nutrient to meet their needs. Iron deficiency can cause anemia and impair mental and motor development, so make sure that any formula you buy is labeled ""iron-fortified"" or ""with iron.""Most doctors recommend cow's milk—based formula because it resembles breast milk most closely and the majority of babies tolerate it, says pediatrician Ari Brown, M.D., author of <em>Baby 411: Clear Answers &amp; Smart Advice for Your Baby's First Year</em>. Cow's milk is also a better source of protein than soy formula, and infants can absorb the calcium in cow's milk more efficiently than they can with soy.Soy formula, though, which uses soy protein in place of cow's milk protein, is a perfectly safe alternative for full-term infants if your family does not eat animal products. (Talk to your doctor about what's best for your preemie.) Pediatricians may also recommend it if your child is unable to digest lactose (milk sugar) or if she seems intolerant to cow's milk formula and becomes gassy, fussy, or vomits during feedings.If you decide to feed your full-term baby soy formula, your pediatrician might recommend additional vitamin and mineral supplements for you to give her.Up to to 30 percent of infants who are allergic to milk are also allergic to soy, says Dr. Brown, a condition that can cause hives, intestinal problems including blood in the stool, and failure to thrive. For these children, doctors recommend special predigested (the proteins of milk have been broken down into their most basic elements so they're easy to digest), hypoallergenic formulas, such as Nutramigen and Alimentum. Hypoallergenic formulas are also recommended for babies at high risk for developing allergies due to a strong family history of them.This is a cow's milk formula for babies who are sensitive to lactose, a condition which can cause fussiness, gas, and/or diarrhea. Lactose intolerance is actually rare in infants and usually develops in older children or adults. Sometimes, though, babies have trouble digesting lactose after a stomach virus, and may need this special formula for a few weeks  -- with your doctor's approval.Recently, the polyunsaturated fatty acids DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and ARA (arachidonic acid) have been added to many formulas such as Enfamil LIPIL, Similac Advance, Nestle Good Start Supreme, and Bright Beginnings. Abundant in breast milk, these two nutrients aid in the development of a baby's brain, eyes, and nervous system. While infants' bodies can make DHA and ARA from oils already present in formula, it's believed that the addition will provide an extra benefit. Some research shows that babies given formula with DHA and ARA have improved vision and score higher on infant development tests than babies fed regular formula, but other research has not shown these correlations. More research is being done, but in the meantime, says Dr. Brown, feeding your baby formula with DHA and ARA certainly won't hurt, though it does have a higher price tag.Organic brands, such as Horizon Organic Infant Formula with Iron, contain all the nutritional value of regular formula but are produced without antibiotics, hormones, and pesticides.While there may be a few slight differences in makeup, both are essentially the same product, says Dr. Brown, and all formulas must be approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Generic formulas may not come in as many variations (with DHA and ARA, lactose-free, etc.), however, so if you prefer or if your baby needs a special formula (or simply enjoys the taste of one over another), brand name may be the way to go."
 Feeding Your Baby,http://www.parenting.com/article/feeding-your-baby,"Few things in life are as wonderful and satisfying as nourishing a new baby. But it can also be tricky. And if you're like most new parents, you're probably getting <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">advice</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> from every corner.""As soon as you have a baby, everyone acts as though they were asked to serve on the committee on how to feed her,"" says Loraine Stern, M.D., coeditor of the American Academy of Pediatrics's (AAP) <em>Guide to Your Child's Nutrition.</em> ""They'll tell you what you're doing wrong, so your job is to nod and smile and to keep doing what's working well for you and your baby.""To get you started on the right track, we've asked the experts for answers to common questions: The best way is to make sure he's growing normally by having him measured and weighed regularly at your pediatrician's office, says Dr. Stern. (This will happen at every well-baby visit anyway.) But remember that it's normal for a newborn to lose about 10 percent of his birth weight in the first few days after delivery. If you're breastfeeding, the doctor may recommend that you bring your baby in for a checkup within two days of leaving the hospital after delivery, to see if he's nursing correctly and consuming enough. A breastfed infant grows more slowly than a formula-fed one; fortunately, the latest growth charts provide measurements for both.At home, you can do a diaper check. A well-fed baby should produce six to ten wet diapers a day, at least four stools if he's breastfeeding, and two to three bowel movements if he's getting formula. Within the first few days of birth, your baby's stools will progress from a dark-brown or black to a mustard color; they'll be more liquid in consistency if he's nursing than if he's formula-fed.At the end of a feeding, your baby should also seem contented, not frustrated and anxious. If you're at all concerned that he's not eating enough, call your pediatrician. Most likely, yes. ""It can be hard for a first-time mom to understand how big a commitment breastfeeding is,"" says Judy Hopkinson, Ph.D., lactation physiologist at the USDA/ARS Children's Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston. ""I tell moms to regard the first four to six weeks of their baby's life as a time to nurse, period. Eventually, you'll settle into a more comfortable routine in which you're not feeding quite as frequently."" Formula takes longer to digest than mother's milk, which makes a baby feel fuller longer; therefore, he may be less likely to wake up hungry. ""But giving your baby more breast milk during the day to meet his growing needs can also help him sleep better at night,"" says William Dietz, M.D., director of the division of nutrition and physical activity at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta. ""If you can breastfeed exclusively, it's of tremendous benefit."" Research has shown that breastfeeding strengthens a baby's immune system, facilitates brain development, reduces the risk of ear infections and sudden infant death syndrome, and helps prevent obesity. It might even cut your baby's risk of developing heart disease when he's an adult.If you have a larger-than-average baby and he's still waking up hungry during the night, however, it may be a sign that he needs additional nourishment, says Dr. Dietz. If your little one's at least 4 months old, ask the pediatrician if you can introduce one or two servings of rice cereal between bottle- or breastfeedings.If your baby's satisfied and growing and you're happy too, there's no reason to change. In the first few weeks of your baby's life, it makes more sense to feed her ""on demand"" until you understand her needs. Some babies need to be fed every one to two hours, while others can go longer in between; nursing babies eat more frequently than formula-fed ones.After a month or two, some moms do prefer to schedule feedings. As long as the baby's content and is eating 8 to 12 times a day, that's okay, says Dr. Stern. Keep in mind that a baby's feeding needs can change, so you may have to readjust her schedule over time. If you listen to your child's signals, you'll do just fine. Most infants move from breast to bottle without much trouble, says Hopkinson. But bottle-feeding is easier for most infants -- the liquid comes out with less effort -- so your baby may start to prefer it over breastfeeding (even if there's expressed milk in the bottle). Since a young baby is most prone to nipple confusion, try to wait until she's been nursing successfully for a month or more before giving her a bottle.Even when nipple confusion does occur, it can be overcome fairly easily. When a baby drinks from a bottle, she doesn't need to open her mouth very wide, but when she nurses, she must open it enough to take in a large circumference of areola so that the nipple and milk can reach the upper palate of her mouth. If she tries to nurse the way she'd drink from a bottle, she won't be able to latch on properly to draw in milk. So when you're nursing, be sure that your baby's mouth is open wide and taking in a good amount of your breast. If she starts to refuse it, brush your nipple against her cheek to stimulate her suckling reflex, and shift positions until she has a good latch-on. When you use a pump, someone else -- your partner in the middle of the night or a babysitter if you go back to work -- can give your baby breast milk from a bottle. Breast milk also freezes well, so you can pump when you have time and defrost it when needed.If you're thinking of pumping, try to breastfeed exclusively for as long as you can in order to build up a decent supply of milk before you begin, suggests Anne Merewood, director of lactation services at the Breastfeeding Center at Boston Medical Center.Which pump you choose depends on how you'll use it: If you're going to be returning to work full-time, you may want to buy (or rent) a double set-up electric pump, with adjustable speed and suction levels; pumping both breasts stimulates them to produce more milk. But if you just need a break at home or have more flexibility at work, a hand pump may be fine. Good brands include Medela and Hollister, says Merewood, who also likes the Avent Isis hand pump. If one doesn't work, try another. ""Too many moms blame themselves instead of the pump,"" she says. All formulas on the market, including generics, must meet strict Food and Drug Administration (FDA) guidelines for content and quality. So switching from one brand to another shouldn't cause a problem, says Dr. Stern, although it may take a little while for your baby to get used to the new taste.What you shouldn't do is switch from one <em>kind</em> of formula to another unless you have a good reason to do so. For most babies, a cow's-milk-based, iron-fortified formula is best.The exceptions: If your baby is lactose-intolerant, try a soy-based formula; if you have a family history of allergies, you can lessen the risk of your baby's developing them by using a hypoallergenic (or elemental) formula. Since these variations may have drawbacks -- and because they are almost certainly more expensive -- schedule a time to talk to your pediatrician first so he can help you choose one that's appropriate for your baby.Avoid low-iron formulas -- they were developed years ago when people believed iron caused constipation in babies. Since then, research has disproven this myth and experts agree that babies need iron to avoid anemia.In 2001 the FDA approved the use of DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and ARA (arachindonic acid) in formulas. This combination of fatty acids is found in breast milk and is important for brain and vision development. Although the enriched formulas more closely mimic breast milk, most experts still aren't convinced that they provide extra benefits, and they cost about 20 percent more than standard formulas.""There is no clear-cut advantage for most babies,"" says Nancy Krebs, M.D., chair of the AAP's committee on nutrition. Research so far is most convincing for preterm infants: All babies receive DHA/ARA while they're in the womb, so preemies may be able to make up for some of the nutrients they missed out on by receiving the enriched formulas. More studies are currently under way, but until the results are available, talk to your pediatrician and weigh any potential benefits against the cost. ""There's no right and wrong,"" says Dr. Krebs, ""and this will not make or break your child's development."" Probably not -- welcome to Spitup 101. Just as bowel movements look different in breastfed and bottle-fed babies, so too does spitup, says Dr. Stern. The protein in formula forms a hard, thick curd in the stomach and takes longer to pass through, so the spitup is less fluid than a nursing baby's. That's also why a formula-fed baby's stools are firmer and less frequent. Gas usually happens when your baby tries to consume too much too soon and ends up gulping a lot of air along with the milk. If you're bottle-feeding, hold the bottle flatter or use a tilted one. If you're nursing and your breasts are very engorged, try pumping them slightly before you start feeding.There's no solid evidence that if a mom eats such potentially gas-producing foods as broccoli, cauliflower, and onions it will affect her nursing baby. But some infants do develop cramping when their mothers drink milk -- they have trouble digesting the cow's-milk protein that can pass through the breasts. If that's the case, talk to your pediatrician, who may suggest that you either cut out or limit your milk intake while you're breastfeeding and get calcium from other dairy sources, such as yogurt or cheese.If your baby seems especially uncomfortable after nursing and you've recently had a particular food or beverage, you may want to scratch it from your diet and see whether that helps.It's also important to burp your baby frequently to let gas escape from his tummy. Use whichever position he seems to like best -- draping him over your shoulder, resting him tummy down on your knee, or sitting him up on your knee and rubbing his back. ""You don't have to use much force on your baby to release gas bubbles,"" says Hopkinson. ""Gently rubbing or patting his back should be enough."" Wait until she's about 6 months old, according to the AAP, and stick to 100 percent fruit juice rather than fruit drinks. Even then, you should limit intake to no more than four ounces per day. (If you want to quench your baby's thirst on hot days, you can dilute the juice with water to increase the volume for her to drink.) Large amounts of juice can cause diarrhea or excessive weight gain and may fill her up so she has less room for breast milk or formula.Once you've mastered the practical stuff, feeding your baby can be a wonderful bonding time, relaxing and rejuvenating for both of you. So hold her close and enjoy the calm -- it won't be long before she's wearing sauce all over her face and pitching peas at the dog.<em>Laura Flynn McCarthy's last article for PARENTING was ""The Truth About Bonding,"" in the December/January 2002 issue.</em>"
 What to Expect: When Does Formula Spoil?,http://www.parenting.com/article/what-to-expect-when-does-formula-spoil,"A. Opened formula, either ready-to-feed or liquid concentrate, shouldn't be left at room temperature longer than two hours—and no more than an hour if the room is warm. Ideally, you should get into the habit of filling the bottle near the refrigerator and putting the remaining formula back before the feeding—but, of course, there's a big gap between the ideal and reality in the middle of the night. Even properly refrigerated liquid formula should be used within 48 hours; if you've made a batch from powdered formula, you should use it within 24 hours. Remaining powdered formula should be used within a month after opening.Any formula left in the bottle an hour after your baby has started feeding should be discarded, so try not to fill the bottle with more than he usually takes. And as with any food, particularly one meant for a baby: When in doubt, throw it out.<i>Contributing editor Heidi Murkoff is the coauthor of the bestselling</i> <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/What-Expect-Youre-Expecting-Edition/dp/0761148574"">What to Expect When You're Expecting</a><i> (Workman) and the author of the </i>What to Expect Kids<i> series of children's books (HarperCollins).</i>"

But imagine a parallel universe where star gift at your shower is imported formula – because the product sold in your country might be tainted.That’s what Chinese moms are up against, and their insistence on foreign formula from places like Hong Kong and Japan are landing some of them in handcuffs. Ever since 2008, especially, when 300,000 infants were affected by reactions to tainted baby formula (6 babies died), Chinese parents have been extra wary of the formula sold by China’s major manufacturers.<strong>Plus:<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/finding-the-right-baby-formula?cid=plusblog""> Finding the Right Baby Formula</a></strong>Yili Group, one of China’s main baby formula manufacturers, recently issued a recall of its formula due to high mercury contamination, and others have recalled because of cancer-causing agents. Chinese culture is one that historically holds human milk in especially high regard for its medicinal properties (there’s a Chinese expression that means, “Human milk cures 100 illnesses”). So it is perhaps surpising the Chinese have turned away from breastfeeding as industrialization and modernization have spread throughout the once-agriculturally-driven country, <a href=""http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/postglobal/pomfretschina/2008/09/behind_the_tainted_formula_sca.html"">according to Newsweek</a>.<strong>Plus:<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/what-to-expect-when-does-formula-spoil?cid=plusblog""> Does Formula Spoil?</a></strong>Other sources report that Chinese mothers are equally concerned with the quality of their own breastmilk, partly due to the pollution in major cities like Beijing.Chinese officials have pledged their efforts to quell the formula freak-out, but so far, no details have been issued and parents’ fears have not been calmed. One drug investigator <a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/realspin/2013/04/16/chinese-mothers-risk-arrest-for-buying-safe-baby-formula/"">told Forbes magazine</a> that he believes more infant deaths are likely unless something changes."
 Finding a Formula,http://www.parenting.com/article/finding-a-formula,"Since commercial formula first became available more than 70 years ago, it has continually undergone modifications and improvements so that it provides the calories and nutrients a baby needs in as close an approximation to breast milk as possible. Formula preparations do differ, however: While the Food and Drug Administration regulates nutrient content, each manufacturer adds its own ingredients and uses its own processing methods. While I can't endorse a specific brand, I can give you an overview of the different types of formula that are available so that you -- together with your baby's doctor -- can choose one that's best for your child.Ordinarily, standard cow's milk formula, with its long history of safe use and extensive testing, is the first choice if breastfeeding is eschewed or halted early. Since regular, whole cow's milk is not recommended for babies under a year of age (it contains little iron, is relatively high in protein and minerals and low in essential fatty acids, and can even cause intestinal blood loss), basic infant formula is derived from cow's milk that has been modified to make it more similar to breast milk and more agreeable to an infant's digestive system.But because some babies do not tolerate regular cow's milk formula, various alternatives have been developed. Unfortunately, many parents do not understand the indications for using these alternative formulas, and switches are often made without a clear rationale. Before deciding to change your infant's formula, speak with your baby's doctor, who can help you make a suitable selection that will be well tolerated by your child.Soy formula, which uses soy protein in place of cow's milk protein (and is also lactose-free), has been available for several decades. It is very popular, and doctors recommend it for a variety of symptoms. Most commonly it is suggested for infants whose fussiness, gas, loose stools, spitting up, or vomiting is believed to be caused by an allergy to cow's milk protein. A soy formula may also be prescribed for infants who have eczema due to a food allergy, trouble digesting lactose, or are recovering from a bout of diarrhea, since the condition can temporarily deplete the lactase enzyme. Some vegetarian parents, like your friend, may prefer to feed their infant a soy formula. Although many breastfeeding mothers choose a soy formula to supplement their infants because they believe it to be healthier, the AAP acknowledges no advantage of soy over cow's milk formula in this instance.Many infants with symptoms of cow's milk allergy also react adversely to soy. These babies may do best on a hypoallergenic (or protein hydrolysate) formula that has been developed for infants with severe food allergies, problems digesting protein, or colic due to suspected cow's milk protein sensitivity. Since the protein in these formulas is broken down extensively (or predigested) so that it does not provoke an allergic response, hypoallergenic formulas are also recommended for babies at high risk for developing allergies due to a strong family history of them. Most hypoallergenic formulas are also lactose-free and contain fats that have been broken down to facilitate their digestion by babies with fat malabsorption. These specialized formulas can be incredibly helpful for certain babies, but they are more expensive than others and are sometimes not very tasty.Follow-up and ""toddler"" formulas are marketed for older babies. These formulas contain extra protein, calcium, and iron for children who may not receive adequate amounts from the food they eat. However, if your child eats a well-rounded diet and drinks regular formula through age 1, this type of formula is probably not necessary.Special formulas are also available for feeding very small, hospitalized premature infants under a doctor's care. Often they are used to supplement breast milk, giving a tiny preemie that extra boost of nutrients needed to promote speedy growth and development. Premature infant formulas generally contain additional calories, protein, vitamins, minerals (like calcium), and easily digestible fats and carbohydrates. Preterm discharge formulas are now available to provide a higher level of nutrients to improve the growth of very premature infants after they leave the hospital.I hope this primer will help you sort through the maze of formula options you've encountered. Once you and your doctor have made a choice, through, don't forget that feedings aren't just about nutrition. They are also an ideal time for intimate social interaction between you and your infant. You can encourage this closeness by holding your baby close to you in a semi-upright position, making eye contact, and speaking softly to him while he eats. Just because you're not breastfeeding doesn't mean you can't share a special bond with your baby during this time."
 Formula Firsts,http://www.parenting.com/article/formula-firsts,"<strong>A.</strong> First, I want to congratulate you for giving breastfeeding a try, and I'm happy to hear that your baby is thriving. While breast milk is preferred infant nutrition, formula manufacturers make every attempt to match the composition of their products as closely as possible to human milk. Over the past few years, attention has been focused on two key ingredients found in human milk  -- the fatty acids DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and ARA (arachidonic acid), which are essential building blocks of brain and eye tissue.Babies get these fatty acids in the womb, from breast milk, and later, from solid foods. They are also made in the body from nutrients found in breast milk and formula, though recent studies have shown that breastfed infants have higher blood concentrations of DHA and ARA than formula-fed infants. Last year U.S. manufacturers began marketing infant formulas that contain DHA and ARA; similar products have been used safely for years in other countries. However, while studies have shown that premature babies benefit from formula supplemented with DHA and ARA, it's not yet clear if full-term infants do.The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated that there is not enough evidence thus far to issue a recommendation on the topic. Since the jury is still out about the benefits of these formulas for full-term babies, right now, it's a personal choice. So talk to your pediatrician to decide what's right for you and your baby."

But the <a href=""http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/"">World Health Organization (WHO)</a> states that “breastfeeding is an unequalled way of providing ideal food for the healthy growth and development of infants” and recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months of life and continued breastfeeding with complementary foods up to 2 years of age or beyond. In order to <a href=""http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/exclusive_breastfeeding/en/"">establish and sustain exclusive breastfeeding</a> for those first six months, WHO and UNICEF recommend that breastfeeding be initiated within the first hour of life, that infants receive only breast milk and no additional food or drink (not even water), that babies breastfeed on demand, and that no bottles or pacifiers be used. Of course, all of that makes no room for formula. And some of that doesn’t fit a lot of women’s lives in the U.S., especially when many women struggle with nursing and must return to full-time work outside of the home just a few months after childbirth, which is one of many reasons why moms may choose to feed their baby formula. Ultimately, the decision as to how to feed one’s baby is a deeply personal one made for any number of reasons, but it’s important for women to have accurate information available when making a choice about breastfeeding versus formula-feeding.<br><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/yes-you-can-use-breast-and-bottle-21391690?cid=plusblog"">Plus: Yes, You <em>Can</em> Use Breast and Bottle!</a></br>All of which brings us back to the Infant Formula Label Statements Experimental Study, which will collect feedback from adult women in four categories: expectant mothers, moms of babies less than 12 months old, mothers of children between the ages of 1 and 5, and women of childbearing age who do not have a child younger than 5 years.

Liquid concentrate</strong> needs to be mixed with water, refrigerated, and used up within 48 hours once opened. It can be handy if your baby's exclusively or mostly formula-fed, but the cans are heavy to carry.<strong>? Ready-to-feed</strong> is, well, ready for feeding: You open the can and pour out the formula. (You can store the rest up to 48 hours.) It's the priciest of the three and the heaviest and largest to store. But it saves you the effort of measuring and mixing.Choosing the right formula depends on your needs, and your baby's. Some parents tell me that their babies handle one type better than another  -- they get constipated with the powdered, say, or spit up the concentrate  -- but these reactions are very individual. If you think your baby is having trouble with his formula, his pediatrician can see whether another type makes sense."

Pediatricians recommend breastfeeding over formula for myriad health benefits—from boosted immunity to lower rates of conditions such as allergies and asthma to reduced obesity, diabetes and ear infections.Meanwhile, seven out of 11 studies of women who received free formula from hospitals found that such women had lower rates of exclusive breastfeeding rates, according to <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/breastfeeding/pdf/BF-Guide-508.PDF"" target=""_blank"">an epidemiological review</a> by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.""The less a baby suckles, usually because formula is introduced, the less milk a woman produces, setting up a downward cycle so that eventually mother will have insufficient milk,"" says Chessa Lutter, senior adviser of food and nutrition at the Pan American Health Organization, a regional arm of the World Health Organization.This raises an obvious question: If pediatricians overwhelmingly believe mothers should be nursing, why do the latest CDC figures show that <a href=""http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/129/3/e827.full#content-block"" target=""_blank"">half of U.S. hospitals still give away baby formula gift bags</a>?The answer stretches back more than half a century. In the late 1950s, formula manufacturers began providing inexpensive formula to hospitals and pediatricians as part of their marketing campaigns.

Herrine, director of Temple University Health System's postpartum unit.First, the baby doesn't have an incentive to suck from the breast, and then a mother will struggle to maintain her milk supply if she isn't regularly nursing. So rather than handing out formula freebies, hospitals and healthcare workers are taking a more organic approach: providing assistance to mothers during the earliest stages of nursing, such as:"
 Finding the Right Baby Formula,http://www.parenting.com/article/finding-the-right-baby-formula,"Organic or generic?

Who wouldn't? Between the organics, the fortifieds, the generics, the premixes and powders, it's nearly impossible to know which one will be right for your baby (and you). Our guide will help take the guesswork out of your next shopping trip.<strong>Q. I'm a savvy shopper and am curious about generic formulas. Do they contain the same key ingredients as brand-name formulas?</strong>All formulas must meet the nutrient standards set by the Food and Drug Administration, and generic formulas are nutritionally sound, says William Klish, M.D., professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX. However, they don't always have the added supplements that many brand names do.<strong>Q. I find the labels confusing. Any tips on how to best interpret what's there?</strong>There is a ton of information to decipher, says Ann Condon-Meyers, a clinical nutritionist at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. It's always good to ask your pediatrician what she recommends, since there are reasons to give certain babies a specific type. Assuming you can start with the basics, the first thing to look for is one that's iron-fortified. You'll also see brands that contain DHA and ARA, two fatty acids that are abundant in breast milk and can enhance development of the brain, eyes, and nervous system. The research on the benefits of these supplements is growing, and doctors are increasingly recommending them. These formulas may be a bit pricier, but they're very likely worth the splurge.<strong>Q. What's the difference between premixed and dry formula? And if I use dry, does it matter what sort of water I mix it with?</strong>The two types are equivalent -- the premixed formulas simply already have water added to them, Condon-Meyers says. ""If you find yourself in a situation where you're unsure of the water supply, or if you're sending your baby to daycare and you want to make sure no mistakes are made in the mixing process, consider buying premixed formula,"" she adds. ""If you use powdered, many doctors suggest sterilizing the water in the early months; after that, tap water is fine."" Boil the water for a few minutes -- especially if you have well water -- and then let it cool to room temperature before mixing.<strong>Q. Should I go organic? I've read that some contain more sugar than regular formula.</strong>Nutritionally, the organic formulas are the same as any other, says Dr. Klish. And though some do contain sucrose, which may be a bit sweeter than other sugars, it's still on par with sugars in other formulas. The bottom line? ""This is more of an emotional decision than a health one,"" says Dr. Klish. If living an organic lifestyle is important to your family, then by all means go for it -- just be prepared to spend extra."
 Formula Fears: Illegal Imports,http://www.parenting.com/article/formula-fears-illegal-imports,"The news about tainted milk in Chinese-made baby formula was tragic and scary, and it made us wonder, ""Could that ever happen here?"" The answer: No (thank goodness!). Formula production in the U.S. is tightly controlled by the Food and Drug Administration, so ""the risk of contamination is extremely, extremely low,"" says Jatinder Bhatia, M.D., of the American Academy of Pediatrics's Committee on Nutrition. Importing formula from China and other countries is actually illegal, so you don't need to worry, for the most part, about choosing a ""safe"" brand (all of the U.S. brands, including generic ones, must meet the same quality standards). The exception: Some small stores may sell illegally imported formula, so if it wasn't manufactured in America, don't buy it!"

 Tips for Mixing Formula,http://www.parenting.com/article/mixing-formula,"Keep your baby safe when preparing <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">formula</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> with these guidelines from the AAPReports linking the deaths of two infants from a bacterial infection to the formula they drank last winter were heartbreaking. Fortunately for bottle-feeders, the formula was found to be safe. Two other babies were also sickened but recovered, and none of the cases have been found to be related—all four occurred in different states. “Neither the powder nor the water used to mix it was found to be contaminated, so it's unknown how this bacteria, called <em>Cronobacter sakazakii</em>, got into the bottle,” explains Steven Abrams, M.D., a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, and a member of the AAP's Committee on Nutrition. “We do know, however, that babies, especially those under a month of age and those born prematurely, are very susceptible to certain germs, so the proper preparation of formula is critical.” The bottom line? Whether you buy the powder, concentrate, or ready-to-drink kind, formula is safe. But since the powder is most affordable, many parents go that route. How to mix it right:<strong><strong>1. SQUEAKY CLEAN </strong>It goes without saying: Wash your hands well with soap and water before each feeding. Consider sterilizing new bottles and nipples by boiling them the first time you use them; after that, washing in a dishwasher will do.</strong><strong>2. ONE AT A TIME </strong><br>It's tempting to prep a day's worth of bottles or to save leftovers for later. But to be on the safe side, nix both ideas. Mix only the serving your baby's about to drink and use it right away. Toss any leftovers and start with a fresh bottle the next time (bacteria from your baby's mouth can contaminate the leftover formula).</br><strong>3. WATER WORKS </strong><br>Only mix powder with plain tap or bottled water that's been boiled for a minute, then cooled down. (Contrary to popular belief, bottled water can contain bacteria.) Boiling the water first sterilizes it and removes anything harmful.</br><strong>4. THE FINE PRINT </strong><br>Follow the directions on the formula container carefully. The powder and water must be measured exactly so your baby gets the nutrients he needs.</br>"

They discovered that the two formulas (one milk-based, one soy-based) sweetened by organic brown rice had arsenic levels 20 to 30 times higher than the formulas made without the syrup. One had a total arsenic level of 60 parts per billion, including 25 ppb of the much more toxic inorganic arsenic. Those levels are dangerous given a baby’s small size and developing bodies, the researchers said. The EPA limit for arsenic in drinking water is 10 ppb.According to ABC News, Nature’s One Baby’s Only Organic Dairy Toddler Formula and Baby’s Only Organic Soy Toddler Formula both contain organic brown rice syrup as the primary ingredient. In a prepared statement, Nature’s One said that they test the arsenic level in their brown rice syrup through an independent laboratory.<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/melanie-parentingcom/lead-discovered-juice-boxes-more?cid=plusblog"">Plus: Lead Discovered in Juice Boxes &amp; More</a>The potential presence of the chemical in infant formula is “particularly worrisome for babies because they are especially vulnerable to arsenic’s toxic effects,” the Dartmouth researchers said.Brown rice contains more arsenic than white rice because it retains the outer layer that’s removed in the white variety.

A few days later, when I expressed my concerns about Kaspar’s latching-or-digestion-or-something (he had reflux) situation to a close, three-time breastfeeding pro of a friend, she suggested I could try feeding Kaspar formula in addition to breast milk. I asked, “Can you <em>do</em> that?” and she reassured me that yes, you can.I ended up being one of those moms for whom breastfeeding works, but not exclusively. Having formula on backup was a huge relief in this context; Kaspar drank a <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/parenting-post/taylor-newman/would-you-feed-another-woman-s-breast-milk-your-baby-i-am"" target=""_blank"">combination of my milk, another friend’s milk, and organic formula </a>-- not the brand that I got in the hospital bag, although we did use that initially. Cuz hey, it was free. Given that my own milk supply wasn’t what I’d hoped it would be, and that we did have some digestion issues and such, I’m grateful to my friend for removing, for me, my sense that it was either/or when it came to breast or bottle. I did my best balancing nursing, pumping, and formula-feeding, and Kaspar rocked the remix just fine; if he was confused over which nipple belonged to me or to the bottle, it didn’t seem to bother him. He chowed down either way. As much as I appreciated adopting a ‘find what works’ perspective, too (first lesson in parenting: don’t get too attached to plans), I found those initial days in the hospital – as I tried to figure out the mechanics of nursing from a book I’d brought along, and not from a real person -- stressful. I was concerned while recovering there that Kaspar would be given formula either by mistake or against my wishes. My assigned roommate’s twin babies were receiving formula, as were most of the babies in the nursery; it was clearly standard procedure. I didn’t receive any informational pamphlets on breastfeeding, that’s for sure. I really had to <em>ask</em> for breastfeeding support. Which I did, because I’d already decided I wanted to breastfeed. But if I’d been on the fence, or hadn’t thought about it at all, it would have been bottles from the get-go, by default.As increasing evidence suggests that <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/natural-parenting/your-new-breastfeeding-consultant-avatar"" target=""_blank"">new moms feel more inclined to breastfeed when information on the how and why of doing so is provided for them</a> (rather than ‘available upon request’), and as <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/natural-parenting/new-aap-breastfeeding-guidelines-six-months-best-babies-and-it-takes-village"" target=""_blank"">the AAP has released new recommendations</a> that babies be exclusively breastfed for at least six months, dozens of consumer and health organizations have now appealed to hospitals to stop doling out the free formula -- and pamphlets, coupons, etc. -- to moms who’ve just given birth. While breastfeeding doesn’t work for everyone, the history of human survival would suggest that it can certainly work for more than 14 percent of infants – the current rate of American infants going steady on the ‘liquid gold.’ US health officials hope to almost double that rate by 2020, too; there’s no question at this point that breast milk really is best for babies, health-wise. That formula (and “information” about its health benefits) is automatically provided to new moms in hospitals, when information and instruction on breastfeeding is often hard to come by and yet crucial to breastfeeding success, seems… um (trying to put this nicely)… like hospitals are missing a huge opportunity to be a part of boosting those breastfeeding rates.In his letter to hospital chief executives, Public Citizen President Robert Weissman wrote that hospitals aim ""to promote the health of infants and mothers, but the ongoing promotion of infant formula conflicts with this mission.” This is right on. Hospitals are indeed promoting, rather than simply providing, infant formula by handing out branded literature on formula, with product. Whether they’re discouraging women from breastfeeding by doing so, as the letter-writers suggest, is debatable, but I’d put good money on a bet saying better breastfeeding information and support in hospitals would increase breastfeeding rates like a charm. In fact, The AAP’s updated recommendations on breastfeeding specifically identify hospitals and pediatricians as major players in supporting breastfeeding success.Hospitals contend that women <em>want </em> the formula samples, and that ""having information and resources available for mothers who choose not to breastfeed is a responsible and supportive approach for the hospital,” according to a statement from the American Hospital Association. Well, duh. The thing is, more women will also <em>want</em> to breastfeed if information and support (not pressure, just so we’re all clear) around that is provided to them in the hospital, too. Of course hospitals should have formula on hand for moms who can’t, or choose not to, breastfeed. But let’s keep it real here. Unless things have changed dramatically since I gave birth in 2010, hospitals aren’t assuming women will breastfeed and then making formula and information on formula ‘available’ if that doesn’t work out for them. Hospitals are handing out corporate formula makers’ swag bags to everyone who leaves the premises with a new baby in their arms.KJ Dell’Antonia wrote last week in her blog Motherlode about <a href=""http://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/04/03/the-true-cost-of-breast-feeding-this-milk-isnt-free/"" target=""_blank"">the hidden costs of breastfeeding</a>, shedding light, perhaps, on one of the reasons lower-income moms breastfeed at lower-than-average rates: breast milk is not, due to the challenges of pumping or nursing amidst inflexible employment situations, free. She wrote, “if the American Academy of Pediatrics’ recommendation that mothers breast-feed for 12 months or more (and breast-feed exclusively for six months or more) is meant for all women, not just those with the resources to withstand economic loss — then we need to support breast-feeding by putting in place laws, policies, programs and social structures that make it easier, rather than attempt to gloss over its hidden costs.” Free formula will obviously appeal to moms for whom economic concerns are pressing, and for whom convenience will be a major factor in feeding their kids. But handing out formula as the ‘solution’ to their problems (or just because they ‘want’ it) fails to address the root of those problems (or the best interest of their babies)—that our society is not supportive of breastfeeding moms. Hospitals, at the very least, should be.What do you think? Should hospitals stop handing out corporate formula swag? Did you receive any breastfeeding support after delivering in a hospital setting? How do you think the hospital systems could be improved to meet the needs of all moms? (Including moms like me, for whom exclusive breastfeeding was not straight-forward and entirely ‘successful’)?"

Back in the '70s when I was an infant, formula was more popular and so I was bottle-fed. Nowadays, breastfeeding is back in style, and it's deemed healthier and more economical. In some cases this is true, but not in all.When I was pregnant, my husband and I took an intensive childbirth class. It included a session on <a href=""http://www.parents.com/baby/breastfeeding/tips/secrets-for-breastfeeding-success/"" target=""_blank"">breastfeeding</a>, where I learned about all of the benefits, how to do it easily (or so I thought), and how to pump. I decided it was what I wanted to do when my child was born.However, things didn't go exactly as planned. When I was still in the hospital after my son was born, I met a lactation consultant who tried to show me how to get a proper latch. But it didn't work so well for my son and me. Every time I tried to get him to latch on, he would scream at the top of his lungs and turn bright red. Even when I left the hospital, he latched on sometimes but wasn't getting the nutrition he needed. He didn't seem to like breastfeeding, and because of his reaction, I didn't like it much either.At that point, <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/baby/feeding/my-choice-not-to-breastfeed-cost-me-friend"">I decided to move to formula</a>. He started with a brand that was provided by the hospital when we were there. My son seemed much happier on that for a while, but soon he started crying a lot during the day and incessantly through the night. I took him to the pediatrician, who thought he had colic, and we changed his formula to a different brand. That changed everything. He stayed on that until he moved to solid food.Another reason that I decided to use formula, outside of my son's tummy issues and inability to latch, was that I knew that I wouldn't have much of a maternity leave because I had started a new job that year. While I could have pumped, <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/formula-feeding"">formula feeding was just much easier</a>.The fact is, while I took the less popular route in today's society, I had a choice between two healthy options. I can't help thinking about women who currently live in developing countries who don't or mothers in the past who didn't. According to a <a class=""vglnk"" href=""http://BBC.com"" rel=""nofollow""><span>BBC</span><span>.</span><span>com</span></a> article, ""<a href=""http://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-25629934"" target=""_blank"">Breastfeeding: Was there ever a golden age</a>?,"" women who had their milk come in late or were unable to breastfeed at all had limited, and usually unsafe, alternatives. Many hand-fed babies died because of the germs and non-sterilized bottles and accessories. It was the relative instability of these hand-feeding methods, along with an explosion of infant deaths accompanying the immigration and employment booms of the industrial revolution, that led physicians to seek a safer way and to the creation of formula.I know that some mothers think of themselves as failures because they have to use formula because they couldn't provide the amount of milk their babies needed. There's no reason to feel this way because we have another healthy option. Like parenting in general, everything is trial and error. Some things that you thought would work for you change when you actually become a parent—the same goes for the choice between breastfeeding and formula."

If unregulated well water is used to mix bottles, the amount of the chemical babies ingest may be higher. Arsenic has been linked to impaired mental function in children.Before you go tossing out your tin of formula, consider what study co-author Kathryn Cottingham, a biology professor at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire concluded from the research:<p style=""margin-left: 20px;"">""The most significant finding was that exposure to arsenic during early infancy in this U.S. population is quite low, regardless of feeding mode. Most of the infants, including the formula-fed infants, in our study were exposed to very low levels of arsenic.""Researchers looked at 874 families residing in New Hampshire. The arsenic levels in their tap water, which originated from private, unregulated wells, was measured. The breast milk of nine mothers was tested, and the urine of 72 six-week-old babies was also measured.The results indicate that formula-fed babies ingested 0.04 micrograms per kilogram per day of arsenic, while breastfed babies ingested 0.22 micrograms per kilogram per day. Arsenic levels in the urine of formula-fed babies was about 7.5 times higher than the breastfed babies.The difference is small, conceded the researchers. It's unclear whether the breastfeeding moms who participated in the study drink well water. The amount of arsenic in tap and bottled water was similar to well water. Some bottled water companies disclose information about chemical levels in their water.The take-home message, Cottingham says: ""<a href=""http://health.usnews.com/health-news/articles/2015/02/23/arsenic-in-well-water-can-raise-level-in-baby-formula-study"" target=""_blank"">Families must arrange for testing of private water sources</a>. State health departments can provide guidance on accredited labs and recommended testing.""Recommended limits vary by state.

 Corn Syrup in Formula,http://www.parenting.com/article/corn-syrup-in-formula,"<span class=""green16b"">Q</span> <strong>After I read your <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">advice</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> to avoid high fructose corn syrup in sodas</strong>, I discovered the label of my infant formula lists ""corn syrup"" the second ingredient. Should I be concerned?<br><br><span class=""grey16b"">A</span> <span class=""grey10"">Yes, very concerned. As I said in that earlier column, corn syrup should be avoided. In fact, this has become such a concern among pediatricians that I routinely talk to children as young as five about looking for the ""bad word"" on food labels  -- corn syrup. It's not too bad for adults and older children to have in limited quantities, but in my opinion, corn syrup has no place in infant nutrition  -- especially infant formulas. Here's why:<br><br><strong>It's an artificial sweetener.</strong> Since the 1970s, high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) has been the darling of the food industry. Usually, the word ""fructose"" is thought to be synonymous with fruit  -- which everyone knows is healthy  -- and what could be harmful about something made from corn? But the fact is with HFCS the food industry has found a way to extract syrup from corn biochemically and then manipulate the percentage of fructose in this syrup. The ingredient you see on the label is not used because of any health benefits, but because it is sweeter and cheaper to produce than cane sugar. As you will see, this artificial sweetener is anything but healthy.<br><br><strong>HFCS can make children fat.</strong> I share the opinion of many nutritionists and other doctors that the number one cause of the childhood obesity epidemic is the overconsumtpion of HFCS, mainly in the form of beverages. In fact, a study reported in the April 2004 issue of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed that people who drank beverages containing HFCS gained more weight than people who ate the same number of calories that day but did not consume as much high fructose corn syrup. Part of the problem is biochemical. When your baby ingests normal sugars (such as those in breastmilk, fruits, vegetables, or milk-based infant formulas), these sugars stimulate the brain with signals saying, ""You've eaten enough. Stop already!"" Fructose, however, does not trigger the satiety signals like glucose does, so it's easier to overeat foods and beverages containing HFCS.<br><br><strong>Too much HFCS can lead to serious health problems.</strong> Obesity leads to other health complications. That's why new research suggests that overconsumption of HFCS can lead to type II diabetes (also called insulin resistance) and heart disease. HFCS is metabolized in the liver differently than other sugars. It can increase the blood level of triglycerides, the fats that clog arteries and contribute to cardiovascular disease. Because HFCS undermines appetite control, you can see that overconsumption is a real risk. The United States is the world's highest consumer of high fructose corn syrup and we rank toward the top in obesity, type II diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. See any correlation?<br><br><strong>HFCS shapes young tastes  -- in a bad way.</strong> One of the most valuable principles in infant and child nutrition is the idea of <em>shaping young tastes.</em> What you feed children when they are young will effect their eating habits  -- and their health  -- for the rest of their life. I tell this to all my patients, even to parents of young infants just beginning solid foods. I advise them to give their baby only the food that nature grows  -- fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and dairy products. In this way, the child's developing taste buds are programmed to recognize the normal tastes of healthy foods.<br><br>Artificial sweeteners in infant formulas can only increase the intensity of the sweet tooth that babies are already born with. The lactose sugar found in mother's milk is sweet, as is the lactose in milk-based infant formulas. Yet lactose is a sugar that the body recognizes and is equipped to metabolize as a normal sugar. In selecting a formula  -- unless your baby's doctor advises otherwise  -- stick to those that contain lactose, not fructose, as the main carbohydrate. This is the sugar nature put in milk, and nature makes few nutritional mistakes.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></span></br></br>"

 Why Formula Feeding Was Right for Me,http://www.parenting.com/article/formula-feeding,"I believe in <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">breastfeeding</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>, but formula was my salvationOne evening, soon after we’d made my second pregnancy public, we had some friends over for dinner. The wife of the couple, a close friend who had breastfed for the recommended year, asked if I was going to try and nurse, this time around. “I mean, why wouldn’t you at least<em> try</em>?” she asked, innocently.This was a rather loaded question.Twenty months earlier, when I’d entered the hospital to deliver my first baby, I had arrived armed with a new nursing bra, a weathered copy of <em>The Nursing Mother’s Companion</em>, and the full intention to embark on a mutually advantageous, successful breastfeeding journey with my son. And then I gave birth, and all hell broke loose. First came the soul-crushing postpartum depression. Then latching issues. A nerve problem in my left breast. A supply problem in my right. Seven different “lactation consultants.” A tongue tie. A frenulectomy. A switch to “exclusively pumping” rather than nursing. A formerly rock-solid marriage straining under expectations and disappointment. A milk/soy protein allergy. And a partridge in a pear tree.  <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/combining-breast-and-bottle-feeding"">Plus: Combining Breast and Bottle Feeding</a>Eventually, I threw in the nursing cover, packed away the pump, and began formula feeding. I was racked with guilt, but also infuriated at the lack of support for formula feeding parents, so I did what every other middle-class, overly-analytical mom in America does when they need an outlet: I blogged about it. I had stumbled on an unfulfilled niche, so the hits came fast and furious, and before I knew it I’d become the unofficial spokesperson for “breastfeeding failures” around the world. Obviously, when I got pregnant with my daughter, the questions inevitably began. Was I going to try breastfeeding again? Depending on the person asking and the day of the week, my answers would range from “of course!” to “hell to the no.” Both were honest. I truly didn’t know what I was going to do. I’d paid lip service to breastfeeding, claiming that I would have continued had I not faced all our problems. Now that I was facing the prospect of a clean slate, though, my view was murkier. As much as I did believe in breastfeeding, I felt I harbored some post-traumatic stress from our experience with our son, Leo. I knew it was irrational, but when I thought of nursing, I thought of pain, depression, frustration, craziness, and most of all, failure. My word associations with “formula” were <em>salvation, ease, freedom</em>. Along with those positive associations came others, too. Like <em>selfish, lazy, unfair. Cheater</em>.I felt tremendous guilt over these emotions. I was a bloody hypocrite. Here I was telling random women all over the world that it was okay to choose formula, that a happy mom meant a happy baby, that there was no shame in not breastfeeding…but when it came to my child, this didn’t hold water. How could I justify not even trying with my daughter?<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/finding-the-right-baby-formula"">Plus: How to Choose the Right Baby Formula</a>This brought a harsh truth to light. I’d claimed my blog, <a href=""http://www.fearlessformulafeeder.com/"">Fearless Formula Feeder</a>, stood for feeding freedom; that I would fight for every woman’s right to feed their child as they felt fit. Reading through the past 16 months of posts, though, the focus was on women in extenuating circumstances--sexual trauma survivors, women with rare illnesses and conditions, cases of extreme postpartum depression and incompatible medications. There was little attention paid to women who decided to formula feed for less dramatic reasons, reasons like having a bad taste in your mouth from a bad breastfeeding experience with your son.I decided I’d give it the old college try, but then the nightmares started. I dreamt of a trio of Macbeth-like lactation consultant witches, trying to force my baby onto my breast. Of a zombie version of me, submitting to an endless cycle of pump, feed, pump, while Leo cried neglected tears in the corner.These dreams were stupid, and I knew it. Still, my subconscious refused to let it be. I started feeling obsessed with the decision, and it was coloring the latter half of my pregnancy. I felt like the guy in Spike Lee’s <em>25<sup>th</sup> Hour</em>, just a day away from starting his prison sentence, which of course made me feel guilty.  A few of my friends were also pregnant with their second kids, and they all kept talking excitedly about tiny newborn clothes and sleepy newborn cuddles. I wanted to puke. I wondered if I was just missing the maternal gene.Considering the bulk of parental responsibility for a newborn consists of feeding it adequately, it made sense that I felt defunct. According to all of the medical literature, all the websites, all the popular social media, I had failed to feed my first child correctly. It didn’t matter that breastmilk made him sick; there was no way a human could be allergic to its mother’s milk--I just hadn’t cut out enough foods from my diet. It didn’t matter that he couldn’t latch; if I’d forgone the bottle of formula to treat his jaundice, he would have breastfed successfully. It didn’t matter that he was tongue-tied; a quick snip should have fixed that, so I probably hadn’t tried hard enough to counteract his aversion to my breasts. It didn’t matter that I was drowning in depression and anxiety; breastfeeding should have improved my mood, and even if it didn’t, I should have pushed through for my son’s sake. It didn’t matter that he thrived on formula; that was simply good luck, and of course, there was still time for the repercussions to develop. And most of all, it didn’t matter that I felt with every bone of my body that formula was the right choice for our family. That made me selfish, ignorant, and irresponsible. It made me a bad mom.<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/parenting-post/breast-feeding-debate-guess-what-it-s-ok-not-nurse-your-babies"">Plus: Why It’s OK to Not Nurse Your Babies</a>It had been easy to brush that all aside once my peer group stopped breastfeeding, and once Leo grew and gave me a million reasons to feel proud of my parenting. Once my daughter was born, though, it was all going to start again, and this time it would be way worse. This time there were no excuses. If I chose to formula feed from the start, it wouldn’t be for her benefit. It would be for mine.In the end, my only decision was to make no decision. I approached the situation like a science experiment. I would let my daughter lead the way, not push her to latch if she couldn’t, and not go to any heroics. I would let whatever happened, happen organically. No expectations.I didn’t know what I wanted. I didn’t know what I hoped. I did know one thing, though. My daughter might not end up getting as much breastmilk as her brother had, but she would get something else Leo never got, in those first months: a real mother, one who be focused on <em>her</em>, rather than the number of ounces dripping out of a Medela pump.Labor went quickly, the second time around. Singing along with Florence and the Machine’s “Dog Days,” about happiness hitting like a bullet to the head, I pushed through one contraction, and laughed my daughter Lucy into this world.<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/when-breast-and-bottle-both-are-best"">Plus: When Breast and Bottle Both are Best</a>The nurse handed her over and I laid her on my bare chest. I wasn’t thinking; I was in a state of pure emotion, pure instinct. Lucy looked up at me with sleepy, calm, newborn eyes, and latched on. <em>Perfectly.</em>I breastfed my daughter for three blissful days. I nursed her until the nerve pain started; until the first fuzzy shadows of postpartum depression began creeping into my peripheral vision; until the pump started talking to me, whispering <em>yousuckyousuckyousuck,</em> just like last time.  But this time, I knew I <em>didn’t </em>suck.  I knew she’d thrive on formula like my son had. This time, the decision would be mine, and not made for me by fate, or the formula company, or the breastfeeding police.And in the end, she was fed. And in the end, she was loved. And in the end, that’s really all that matters.<em>The foregoing is adapted from </em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Bottled-Up-Babies-Motherhood-Shouldnt/dp/0520270231""><strong>Bottled Up: How the Way We Feed Babies Has Come to Define Motherhood, And Why It Shouldn’t</strong></a><strong>, </strong><em>by Suzanne Barston.

The author of the piece points out that babies who receive milk through banks affiliated with The Human Milk Banking Association of North America must have a prescription, and the association has FDA and CDC oversight and follows stringent screening, processing and distribution guidelines. But moms who are unable to breastfeed or pump and don't have babies with a recognized health problem that requires a prescription, are left to use the unregulated donations coordinated by online milk sharing forums.<strong>More from News Break:</strong> <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/news-break/dangerous-reason-you-shouldnt-kiss-your-newborn-if-you-have-cold-sore"">The Dangerous Reason You Shouldn't Kiss Your Newborn If You Have a Cold Sore</a>Dr. Adam Ratner, Division Chief of Pediatric Infectious Diseases at New York University School of Medicine, says a host of infections and diseases can be transmitted via unregulated breast milk, such as HIV, hepatitis B and C, cytomegalovirus (CMV), and group B Streptococcus (GBS), to name a few.""<a href=""http://www.forbes.com/sites/kavinsenapathy/2016/05/17/parents-put-that-strangers-breast-milk-down-and-pick-up-a-bottle-of-formula/#1ae48d67279e"" target=""_blank"">Many of these infections can occur without causing symptoms</a>.

The infant’s blood-alcohol level was a “potentially life-threatening” 0.294 according to authorities.The young mom, 20, told Kenosha, Wisconsin, police officers that she didn’t realize the water bottle was filled with vodka, since she had previously filled it with plain water. But reportedly, the baby’s father later emptied the bottle and refilled it with <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/news-break/parents-urged-to-discuss-alcohol-kids-young-age-nine"">alcohol</a>, with plans to take it to a friend’s house. After feeding her infant, the mom quickly noticed <a href=""http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2015/09/09/baby-hospitalized-vodka-mixed-formula/71934574/"">odd behavior from the little one</a>—red toes, eyes half closed—and the parents realized the mistake that had been made. Sadly, what came next was a terrible fight between mom and dad over who was to blame, according to Lieutenant Brad Hetlet, a spokesman from the Kenosha Police Department. The baby was rushed to Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin in Milwaukee and admitted to the ICU as a precaution, due to her high blood alcohol level. And the dad? He’s facing charges—not for the alcohol incident, but for the argument with the mom.This is such a random story! And it’s sad that the parents played the blame game and got in an argument that was clearly so bad it led to charges. But let's focus on the good news here: according to Hetlet, the baby is going to be okay.<p itemprop=""articleBody""><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/news-break/bedtime-suggestions-kids-goes-viral"">Helpful or Hilarious?

Once production ends later this year, the drug companies will sell a single formula for all children under the age of 12, although manufacturers have warned that there will be a period of transition where multiple concentrations of the infant products may be available in stores and in medicine cabinets simultaneously, so parents and caregivers should be sure (as always) to carefully read the product labels. Eventually, infants’ products will have syringes for more accurate dosing and flow restrictors, while children’s products will continue to be available with dosing cups, but both will have the same formulation.<br><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/easing-babys-pain?cid=plusblog"">Plus: Ease Baby's Pain After Vaccinations or Heel Sticks</a> </br>At the same time, the FDA also issued final guidance for the production, marketing and distribution of liquid OTC pain relievers, cold medicines, cough syrups and digestion aids that are measured and dispensed with spoons, cups, or droppers included in the packaging. Among its main recommendations, the FDA stated that dispensing devices should be marked with calibrated units of liquid measurement (for example, teaspoon or milliliter) that match the units of measurement specified on the label instructions, and should not have any unnecessary markings. Additionally, the markings on dispensing devices should be clearly visible when the liquid medicine is added to the cup, dropper, etc. Have you ever been confused (late at night, when your kid’s spiking a fever) about how much medicine to give?

 Ask Dr. Sears: Persistant Cradle Cap,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-persistant-cradle-cap,"<a href=""https://flic.kr/p/6PfgYh"" target=""_blank"">Flickr</a><strong>A. </strong>Your babies' cradle cap, also known as seborrheic dermatitis, is likely caused by the overproduction of the oil glands in the skin of the scalp. The glands produce an oily substance called sebum, which cakes on the skin. The good news is that while it may be unsightly, it's usually not irritating or bothersome to babies. <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/5-common-infant-skin-conditions"">Eczema</a> has a similar appearance to cradle cap but can be intensely itchy and uncomfortable. It tends to be located in the spots you've described. But since your pediatric dermatologist has ruled out eczema, the most likely cause of your babies' dry patches is an allergy, and the culprit is probably the milk-based formula your babies are on, rather than the rice cereal. It's important to note, however, that formula allergy rashes are usually more pronounced on the face. Also, if a baby has an allergic reaction to formula, intestinal discomforts are typical, namely bloating, colicky abdominal pain and diarrhea. Try this step-by-step plan to clear your babies' skin.Consider switching to a formula that has less allergenic proteins, such as Alimentum or Nutramigen. If the dermatitis is indeed due to a formula allergy, you should see improvement within a couple of weeks. Be sure to consult your babies' doctor before making this change.To cure cradle cap, massage a vegetable oil into the crust-like scales. Let the oil soak in for fifteen minutes to soften the scales, then remove them with a soft baby hairbrush. To completely get rid of the scaliness, use an over-the-counter tar-based shampoo once a week. The omega-3 fats found in fish oil are another effective remedy due to their anti-inflammatory properties (the dermatitis that you've described is most likely due to a generalized inflammation of the skin). While omega-3s are now added to the latest infant formulas, they may not be present in high enough doses to efficiently work as an anti-inflammatory on your babies. Ask your doctor to recommend a pharmaceutical-grade fish oil. Add no more than 500mg a day to your babies' formula: Simply open a 500mg capsule and squirt it into the bottle. Once the dermatitis has cleared, gradually wean your babies off the added fish oil but keep them on an omega-3-enriched formula. If there's a recurrence, simply resume the fish oil. If the dry, scaly skin persist throughout their toddler years, I suggest you feed your growing twins at least 3 ounces of wild salmon a couple times a week.The dermatitis you described may also be due to the inability of the skin to retain moisture. Try this trick: After bathing your babies with a mild, moisturizing soap such as Dove, rinse the soap off well. Gently pat the skin partially dry, leaving a slight layer of water on the skin  -- just enough so you can feel the moisture. Apply an emollient ointment (such as Soothe and Heal by Lansinoh) over the affected areas. The ointment seals in the water above the crusted areas and hydrates the skin. Also, offer each baby an extra 8-ounce bottle of water to drink daily. Using these hydration methods, you'll water the skin from the inside out.Dry skin loves humidity. Central home heating during the winter months robs the skin of much-needed moisture. Run a warm-mist vaporizer in the nursery. Vaporizers not only moisturize the skin, but they act as a heat source, allowing you to turn down the drying heat in your home.Babies who begin life with sensitive and irritated skin are likely to retain this quirk throughout childhood. This means you'll need to keep a diary to identify the dry-skin triggers, such as food allergens, irritating clothing or detergents. Through trial and error you will gradually formulate your own personal skin-care program, arriving at the a diet and environment that's just right for your twins."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Baby's Painful Night Noises,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-babys-painful-night-noises,"Q. My 5-week-old baby makes crying and grunting noises while asleep. He has reflux and is on Prilosec. Could that be the cause? Also, it seems like he isn't <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">sleeping</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> very deeply. Could this be a problem?<br><br>A. It's likely that your baby's reflux is the cause of both his sleep noises and his problem sleeping deeply. Most likely, your baby is restless at night because he has ""baby heartburn""—that's what reflux feels like.</br></br>Reflux, also known as <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-coping-with-babys-acid-reflux"">gastroesophageal reflux or GER</a>, is the backwash of milk and irritating stomach acids against the sensitive lining of the esophagus. Normally a muscular valve that joins the esophagus to the stomach closes to prevent this regurgitation. But approximately thirty percent of babies experience some type of reflux because this valve is immature. As babies grow, the valve strengthens. Most infants eventually outgrow the reflux by their first birthday.Mild reflux causes non-painful ""spit-up."" If it's severe, it can lead to painful night waking (often misdiagnosed as ""colic""), and stomach acids can be regurgitated as high as the throat, causing grunting noises and even wheezing like baby asthma. I suspect this is what's behind your baby's grunting.The treatment of reflux is based upon the following three principles, depending on its severity:<br>1. Lessening the secretion of stomach acids (which is why your baby is on an anti-reflux medicine)<br>2. Letting gravity help to keep the milk down better<br>3. And getting the milk to empty from the stomach faster</br></br></br>Here's the reflux regimen we use in our pediatric practice:That is the main reflux rule. Smaller, more frequent feedings are easier to digest, allowing milk to be emptied from the stomach faster.Keep him upright and quiet (no jostling, please!) for at least a half-hour after feeding. This lets gravity help empty the milk from the stomach quicker. Wear your baby many hours a day in a soft carrier. Try to keep your baby as calm as you can during digestion, because crying increases intra-abdominal pressure and aggravates reflux.Breastmilk is appropriately dubbed the easy-in/easy-out food because it empties from the stomach much quicker than formula and softens baby's stools to prevent constipation, which also might aggravate reflux.These pre-digested formulas (Alimentum and Nutramigen) empty from the stomach quicker than standard formulas. Also, babies with reflux have a higher incidence of intolerance to cows-milk-based formulas.Saliva acts both as a natural lubricant and helps repair the irritated lining of the esophagus. Let your baby suck on your finger, or even a pacifier, between feedings.To let gravity help your baby at night, elevate the head of his crib approximately thirty degrees by placing blocks under the two front feet of baby's crib. You could also try a reflux wedge, available from infant product stores. This wedge allows baby to sleep at about a 30 to 45 degree angle, thus lessening regurgitation and painful night waking.Note your baby's symptoms and jot down everyday whether they're getting better, worse or staying about the same. Your observation will help your doctor prescribe the appropriate acid-controlling medicines.Consult the Pediatric and Adolescent Gastroesophageal Reflux Association (PAGER) at <a href=""http://www.reflux.org"" target=""_new""> reflux.org</a>. This organization is composed of parents and professionals who have had children with reflux. They are very knowledgeable about the treatment."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Feeding Schedule for Solids,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-feeding-schedule-for-solids,"<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=14501137&amp;src=id"">Shutterstock Image</a><strong>A:</strong> Whatever feeding schedule gets the most food into your baby with the least amount of hassles is the right one for you and your baby. Remember, feeding your baby is a social interaction, not just delivery of food. So, you want to help this special time be more fun and less mess. Try these solid-food strategies.With new insights into infant development, it's<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/sasha-emmons/baby-solids""> best to wait </a>until around six months to begin solids. At that time your baby's intestines have become more mature, so that allergies and intolerances to solid foods are less likely to occur. Also, around six months, the tongue-thrust reflex—which causes food to be spit out rather than swallowed—diminishes. Lastly, teeth appear around six months. So, if your baby is not happy about solids at four months, wait a month or two and try again. All his nutritional needs can be met by the infant formula (figure approximately two ounces of formula per pound of baby's weight).Favorite first foods for most babies include mashed banana, pears, avocado, squash, sweet potato, applesauce and rice cereal. With our own children, we found that a mashed, ripe banana was a favorite starter solid. Place a test dose dab of banana on your fingertip and place it on your baby's tongue. If the food goes in accompanied by an approving smile, you know baby is ready and willing.If the fingertip test works, gradually increase to a teaspoon, then a tablespoon. As a general guide for feeding solids at all ages, babies do better with the concept of grazing—small, frequent feedings spaced throughout the day. Your baby's tummy is the size of his fist, so it is unlikely that your baby will eat more than one fistful of food at one sitting. Don't expect a six-month-old to take more than a tablespoon of solid food at one feeding. Since your baby is used to swallowing milk, begin with solids that have a soupy consistency and gradually progress to pasty consistencies, and then to lumpy consistencies. Always keep in mind that your initial goal is to introduce your baby to the taste and texture of new foods, not to fill him up.The term ""feeding schedule"" varies greatly according to the temperament of your baby and the time management of the caregiver. There is some merit to putting baby on a predictable feeding schedule. Offer solids at the time of the day when your baby seems the hungriest and you have the most time. Mornings are usually the time when most formula-fed babies eat the most. Late afternoon is usually the favorite solid-food time for breastfed babies, since that's the time of the day when some mothers notice their milk supply is diminished. It makes no difference whether you give him fruits or vegetables for lunch, breakfast or dinner. Again, keep in mind that <em>grazing</em> is the buzzword for infant feeding. Feeding too much, too frequently is likely to lead to abdominal discomfort and constipation.These are the three magic words of infant feeding. Make your own baby food as much as possible from fresh fruits and vegetables. That way you shape your infant's tastes toward what fresh food is supposed to taste like. This is the earliest way to program him against the taste of junk food later on. I have noticed in our pediatric practice a group of moms I dub ""pure moms""—those who don't let their babies eat any processed, canned or jarred foods pass the lips of their babies for the first couple of years. I have observed that these children tend to grow up with much healthier eating habits and tend to appreciate fruits and vegetables and the fresh taste of healthy foods."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Combo-Feeding Tips,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-combo-feeding-tips,"A. Yes, it's perfectly fine to mix breast milk and formula in the same bottle. Also, you can both breast- and bottle-feed successfully. However, there are certain rules of the game that combo-feeders have learned. In our practice, when a mother needs to combo-feed (for example, when returning to work), we recommend ways that Mom can continue to keep her milk supply up while giving her baby supplemental bottles. If you choose to supplement without actively maintaining your breast milk supply, you run the risk of your milk dwindling, leading to weaning before you and your baby is ready. Here are a few ways to keep things flowing:Once upon a time, it was considered routine to tell breastfeeding mothers to give their baby a bottle for all kinds of unnecessary reasons, such as ""to get the baby used to it,"" and to give the mother relief from nursing. Studies have shown that this kind of advice undermines the confidence of a mother because it implies that you won't have enough milk for your baby; and that often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The newest trend in breastfeeding-friendly hospital nurseries is to not send mom home with a discharge pack containing formula or give her any advice that suggests that she may not have enough milk. Producing breastmilk is not only a physical experience, it's emotional as well. While you feed your baby, imagine your milk flowing and imagine yourself making lots of milk. If you worry you won't ave enough milk for your baby, you won't.You want your baby to associate you with feeding, and to know that milk is coming from your breast, not a bottle. Your baby should associate breastfeeding with nutrition and comfort. When you must give her a bottle, have Dad or a caregiver offer it.""Frequency"" is the magic word for increasing milk supply. Breastfeeding your baby at least every two hours is an optimal schedule to follow.A couple times a day lie down and breastfeed your baby off to sleep. The relaxing environment of napping with your baby will often work increase your milk supply. Also, <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/crib-sleeping-vs-co-sleeping"">co-sleeping</a> with your baby is another method that is thought to help.Wear your baby in a sling-type carrier as often as you can throughout the day, as proximity fosters feeding. If your baby is inches away from her favorite food, she's likely to eat more often!Finally, remember to take care of yourself. If <em>you</em> are happy and rested, you will make more milk. From the description of your feeding pattern, I'm concerned that if you continue increasing the frequency of bottle-feeding, your milk supply will also continue to dwindle. But if you reverse the trend and think of bottles as a supplement, or in addition to your daughter's primary source of food—breast milk—your supply should at least stay the same, if not improve. I hope you can work out a feeding plan that you enjoy. You're going to spend more time feeding your baby than any other single interaction during the first year—so, enjoy it!"
 Ask Dr. Sears: Cows' Milk for Babies?,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-cows-milk-for-babies,"<strong>A.</strong> Cow's milk has gotten an unfair rap lately. Realistically, cow's milk is a very rich source of nutrition in a small package. Milk is high in protein, a healthy carbohydrate called lactose, B-vitamins, vitamin A, vitamin D and zinc. A guide I give patients in my pediatric practice is: no cow's milk before age one, <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/whole-or-two-percent"">whole milk until age two and low fat or non-fat milk after that</a>. Once baby is weaned from the breast, 24 ounces of cow's milk or goat's milk a day is plenty.There are two reasons why the Committee on Nutrition of the American Academy of Pediatrics discourages the use of cow's milk under one year of age: allergies and iron- deficiency anemia. The intestinal lining is slower to mature in some babies than others. While lactose intolerance is rare in infants, some toddlers and older children can develop diarrhea, bloating and abdominal pain, because of their inability to digest the lactose sugar in milk. Also, the allergic proteins may seep through the irritated intestinal lining into the bloodstream and cause an allergic reaction, such as a runny nose, wheezing or a red, raised, sandpaper-like rash, especially on the cheeks. Some babies who are allergic to cow's milk can even get frequent ear infections.Iron-deficiency anemia is another problem, as there is very little iron in cow's milk. If baby is allergic to the cow's milk protein, the irritated intestines may consistently lose a tiny bit of blood into baby's stools.Because of the concerns about getting too much cow's milk too early, try these recommendations:Since your baby is thriving on your milk, it sounds like you just need to figure out ways of nursing her more often. They like to play a lot during the day and forget to nurse. Twice a day, take her into a dark, quiet room, such as a bedroom or bathroom and get down to the business of nursing. At prescheduled times of the day, snuggle down with her and let her breastfeed off to sleep.While most babies will simply increase the frequency and duration of nursing to meet their needs, if your baby doesn't, suggest trying an iron-fortified DHA/AA-enriched formula. Use a brand recommended by your baby's doctor. If she prefers cow's milk to infant formula, it's okay to give her one or two 8-ounce bottles of cow's milk starting around one year of age. However, consider the bottles of cow's milk as an addition to, but not as a substitute for your more nutritious milk.When giving her cow's milk, it's best to give her small, frequent feedings by breaking up an eight-ounce bottle into two four-ounce feedings. Smaller feedings enables the intestines to get used to and digest a different type of milk.Ounce for ounce, yogurt is more nutritious than cow's milk for three reasons:When you start cow's milk, it's preferable to buy organic. While milk is an extremely nutritious food, the antibiotics, hormones and other stuff that are given to some dairy cows nowadays may be harmful. ""Certified organic"" means there were no hormones or antibiotics added to the cow feed. Another option is to give your baby goat's milk. Goat's milk protein forms a softer and more easily-digestible curd and contains less potentially allergenic proteins.Finally, once you wean from your milk onto cow's milk, it's necessary to give your baby more iron-containing foods, such as prune juice, iron-fortified cereals, beans, organic meats, lentils and tofu."
 Breastfeeding -- Answers to Moms' Most-Asked Questions,http://www.parenting.com/article/breastfeeding---answers-to-moms-most-asked-questions,"In the 25-plus years that I've been counseling new moms about nursing, I've probably heard every possible concern. Worrying about breastfeeding is completely normal -- especially if you're doing it for the first time. Such doubts, however, can sometimes lead a woman to wean earlier than she otherwise would have. But knowledge is power; if you learn all you can about breastfeeding, you'll be <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">better</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> able to keep yourself -- and your baby -- on track. The following seven concerns are ones that I'm often asked about:<i>Marianne Neifert, M.D., is a </i>PARENTING<i> contributing editor and the author of </i>Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding.It may seem as if you're always nursing your infant, especially in the beginning. Breast milk is easily digested, so a newborn needs to eat at least eight times in a 24-hour period.But don't be alarmed if your baby suddenly wants to feed even more frequently than usual. Hunger spurts are common in breastfed infants, especially those who nurse exclusively. They often occur around 10 days, 3 weeks, 6 weeks, and 3 months of age, though they can happen at any time. In some cases, they're caused by a temporary decrease in a mother's milk production, due to overexertion or fatigue. Although you may be tempted to give your baby formula or even cereal to satisfy him, doing so may only reduce your milk supply.Instead, simply follow his cues and put him to the breast as often as he asks. You'll probably need to breastfeed for 20 minutes every two hours or so for a couple of days until your supply adjusts to his increased demand. During this time, eat a balanced diet and drink plenty of fluids. And get extra rest: Even though you've heard it a hundred times, try to nap when the baby does, get someone else to cook dinner, and ask your partner, friends, or relatives to pitch in with chores (or let the house go for a couple of days).It's one thing to nurse a toothless newborn; it's another to put a baby with a few tiny choppers to your breast. But your little oneisn't likely to nibble while she's actively feeding -- her tongue will cover her lower teeth when she's suckling. At the end of a meal, however, when the flow of milk has tapered, an infant can get restless or playful and take a nip.To discourage her, gently remove her from your breast as soon as she stops swallowing. If she manages to chomp down anyway, say no in a firm voice and end the feeding. Nearly all babies learn pretty quickly not to bite the mom who feeds them!Mothers, whether they're going back to work or not, often tell me that they've waited six weeks (or until they think breastfeeding's been well established) to begin using a pump. But it's fine to start sooner -- even the day your milk comes in.There are several advantages to expressing your milk during the first week of your baby's life. The key to stimulating production is to empty the breasts. So if your newborn doesn't nurse vigorously, pumping for about ten minutes immediately after each feeding can drain most of the remaining milk. It can also help relieve engorgement and coax flat or inverted nipples to protrude more.After the first week, you can express any leftover milk after your baby's early-morning and/or midmorning feed -- the times of day when your supply is most plentiful. This practice will continue to increase your daily production as well as provide milk that you can store or freeze for later use.Though exclusive breastfeeding is ideal, feeding your infant some formula occasionally (a bottle every couple of days or so, for example) most likely won't turn your baby off the breast.If you're considering whether to bottle-feed once in a while, it's important to take into account your baby's age. It's best to delay formula until he's about 1 month old and your milk supply is well established. Newborns are also more susceptible than older babies to nipple confusion (when they prefer an artificial nipple, which is easier to grasp than the real thing) because they're still learning how to latch on and suckle effectively.A better option? Expressing your milk and then bottle-feeding it to your infant. Breast milk is healthier, and pumping it won't limit your production.If, for some reason, your baby begins to prefer the bottle to the breast, don't panic. You can retrain him to nurse correctly, especially if you have a generous milk supply. Until he's back on track, try the following: Stop all convenience bottles; offer your breast as soon as your little one seems hungry -- he's awake, he's rooting, he's bringing his hand to his mouth; and create positive associations by allowing him to nurse for comfort and by holding him skin to skin against your bare chest.However, if your pediatrician says to supplement with formula, do it. This is usually the fastest way for an infant to regain the pounds he needs to get to a healthy weight.A baby may favor one breast because the nipple is easier to grasp, there's more milk on that side, or the milk flows easier. Sometimes a mom may unintentionally nurse more often on one side (usually the left breast if she's right-handed). The unequal milk supply can cause a woman's breasts to become lopsided.An unequal supply isn't usually a problem. If your baby is gaining weight and seems content after feedings, she's probably getting enough milk between the two breasts. If you recognize her preference early on, you can increase production on the weaker side by pumping after she feeds or by starting her off on that side, if she'll let you. (The longer you wait, though, the more difficult it'll be to boost milk production on the side that has the lower amount.)Although nursing in public isn't against the law in any state, many moms feel self-conscious about baring their breasts away from home. But with practice, you can become confident feeding your baby almost anywhere. Some tips:If you still feel embarrassed -- so much so that you postpone a feeding when you're out -- attend a La Leche League meeting or talk to other nursing mothers so you can learn how they've managed to make it work.Mothers are often mistakenly advised to interrupt breastfeeding when they're taking medication, such as antibiotics. The truth is that most drugs are safe for nursing; only minimal amounts actually pass into breast milk.But it's best to be cautious. Whenever your doctor prescribes medicine, make sure he knows you're breastfeeding. Let the baby's pediatrician know as well. Ask both about possible side effects -- for you and your infant. (The same is true for any over-the-counter drugs. Check the label and notify both doctors.)Try to take any medication right after you've finished nursing, since the peak drug concentration in breast milk will usually be reached between feedings.That said, there are a few drugs that are toxic for breastfed babies, such as some antidepressants or those used for chemotherapy. But even if you must take a drug that isn't safe for your infant, you don't have to wean her: You can stop nursing temporarily and pump and dump your milk. This can preserve your supply and allow you to start breastfeeding again when you're ready.Armed with the information you need, you can overcome these and other hurdles. It's worth it -- after all, nursing a baby is one of the precious rewards of motherhood."
 Boobytraps: Advice for Breastfeeding Problems,http://www.parenting.com/article/breastfeeding-problems,"Nursing your <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">baby</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> is natural, but it's not always easy. Here's how to avoid common obstacles. <span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Breastfeeding is a hot topic, with celebrity moms like Gisele Bündchen, Kourtney Kardashian and Laila Ali using their star power to publicly tout nursing. Even first lady Michelle Obama is on board as an advocate, hence why breastfeeding has become a public health issue, much like seat belt use or smoking.</span>The message is clear. Breastfeeding is at its most popular level in more than 35 years, with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reporting as many as three out of four women initiating nursing — up from one in five in 1972, the lowest rate noted in the last century, according to a review in The Journal of Nutrition. There are more lactation consultants than ever, government-funded support programs, faster and more affordable breast pumps and even iPhone apps available to help moms succeed at nursing. Yet at the same time, only 22 percent of babies receive breast milk until at least age 1, as recommended by the American Academy of Pediatrics. So what's the problem? Why are so many moms starting and then stopping breastfeeding or never starting at all?Dozens of booby traps sabotage our efforts. As described by lactivists (lactation activists), booby traps are barriers that hinder a mother's ability to nurse successfully. Physical obstacles, such as low milk supply or a bad latch, as well as social ones, like nursing in public, put pressure on well-intentioned moms to toss out their nursing bras and opt for a bottle. “Nursing problems have become an epidemic,” says Diana West, a renowned lactation consultant who co-wrote the latest edition of The Womanly Art of Breastfeeding. When breastfeeding doesn't come easily, “Moms automatically assume they've done something wrong,” West says. But they haven't. They've just faced some obstacles that can seem insurmountable at the time. Doctors, lactivists, moms and more weighed in on the most common breastfeeding “booby traps.” Here's how to overcome them and maximize your chances of having a successful breastfeeding experience.Many moms are worried their milk supply is subpar, says Colette M. Acker, executive director at the Breastfeeding Resource Center in Abington, Pennsylvania, and a lactation consultant. But often, they're looking at the clock and trying to feed baby according to an arbitrary schedule, she says, not realizing that newborns nurse frequently and can vary in the length of time they'll want to spend at the breast. Rather than worry about how much milk baby is getting, take cues from his behavior. “Look at baby's weight gain, temperament before and after nursing, listen for audible swallowing and count the number of wet and poopy diapers,” she says. By the first week, six to eight wet diapers, plus three or four yellow, poopy ones are normal per day. You may be making more milk than you realize. If you still think your production is low, schedule a meeting with a lactation consultant who can properly assess your milk supply. She will likely observe a feeding and make recommendations.Twenty to 30 seconds of slight pain or gentle tugging when initiating nursing is normal, but if that pain persists longer, a bad latch may be to blame. Those early weeks of breastfeeding weren't pleasant for Carrie Lenkenhoff, a 30-year-old mother of three. A nurse in the hospital told her to hold her breast like a hamburger, not a cigarette, but the advice stopped there. “I felt like it was my first act of motherhood, and I'd failed,” Lenkenhoff says. “It took a few weeks before my baby and my breasts formed a relationship.” Try letting baby initiate a latch on his own. Too often, moms take control, positioning babies horizontally and pouring their boobs into babies' mouths. Acker recommends mom and baby lay together skin-to-skin; baby will show readiness for food by lifting his head. Gently guide his head toward your breast, but let him stay in the driver's seat. Gravity will help ensure a deep latch, beyond just the nipple. Lanolin cream, hydrogel pads and breast milk (just rub it on and let it dry) can soothe sore nipples.“We hear from moms who are angry at the hospitals, doctors and nurses for undermining their attempts at breastfeeding by quickly recommending formula when it's not medically indicated,” says Bettina Forbes, co-founder of Best for Babes, a breastfeeding advocacy group. Her solution? “Be resourceful and ask a lactation consultant for a second opinion,” Forbes says. If you plan to deliver in a hospital, find out beforehand if it has strong pro-breastfeeding policies.Just because baby is spitting up doesn't mean she has reflux. Look for the signs: discomfort when eating or swallowing, crying before spitting up or an arched back while crying. Acker suggests shorter and more frequent feedings. Hold your baby upright after a feeding and offer a pacifier, which can help keep digestive juices down instead of coming up. Talk to your pediatrician about whether your diet could be affecting baby.Although the initial latch may feel foreign, many women find comfort by nursing their babies. Visiting a lactation consultant — who will want to watch you nurse and may need to touch your breasts — also may be awkward for some women. West urges moms to seek out other moms for added support and help overcoming emotional reservations. Breastfeeding is not something women are meant to do on their own, she says. “Find your nursing network,” West says. “Make friends with other nursing moms. Find an online support group or a local nursing moms group. Attend a breastfeeding class.” Local hospitals may offer nursing support programs.Keva Zeigler counsels low-income expectant moms about the benefits of breastfeeding, but she wasn't always a believer. The Detroit mother of four was always turned off by breastfeeding until her last child was born. It wasn't until Zeigler witnessed a friend nursing that she realized just exactly how it worked.Zeigler tells her story so other women can stop believing myths and instead learn the truths: Breastfeeding is natural, and sex while nursing can still be spicy. Just get creative in the bedroom! Zeigler tells women to talk openly with their husbands or boyfriends about why breastfeeding is important and to nurse often in front of them. Let your partner see breasts as something other than bedroom playthings, Zeigler says. “I tell them to just go with it; so what if there's a little milk in the bedroom?” she says with a laugh. “That usually gets the moms laughing and we can move on to other concerns.”We say: Only if you let it be. Enlist your partner's help for diaper changes, baths, burping and cuddle time. When she's about 6 months old, dad can help by feeding baby her first solids.Start with your local breastfeeding support group. The mothers or trained counselors there may be able to help at no cost. You can find La Leche League groups in almost every large town and city by calling 877-452-5324 or at <a href=""http://llli.org/"">llli.org</a>. You can also find information online at <a href=""http://kellymom.com/"">kellymom.com</a>. If your problem requires the advanced expertise of an international board-certified lactation consultant but your insurance doesn't cover visits, you may still be eligible for reimbursement in a flexible spending plan. Some hospitals offer low- or no-cost outpatient lactation consultations. You can also consider asking for a consultation as a baby shower gift.If you're one of the 3 to 9 percent of women with flat or inverted nipples, talk to a lactation consultant before your baby is born for tips to draw your nipples out. She may recommend devices or suggest pumping briefly before nursing to draw out your nipples. If all else fails, she may show you how to use silicone nipple shields to help baby latch.Seek out nursing moms via online or local support groups. Facebook's “Breastfeeding” group boasts more than 55,000 fans, and many regularly provide comments to questions. Or check out the forums at <a href=""http://kellymom.com/"">kellymom.com</a> or <a href=""http://theleakyboob.com/"">theleakyboob.com</a>.Lactation consultants come armed with answers whether your question is about the frequency of feedings, pinpointing an infection or something else. Find one near you during pregnancy so you're prepared after delivery. Some offer services at pediatrician offices. Visit <a href=""http://llli.org/"">llli.org</a> or, for immediate assistance, call La Leche League at 877-452-5324.Look for other nursing mothers at local moms' groups, in an online forum or in your own circle of friends and family. Your local La Leche League leader can also pair you with an experienced nursing buddy.Your partner may not be able to breastfeed, but he or she can still encourage you. Ask for help with other chores to ease workload stress and remind him that he can bond with baby during baths, bedtime, diaper changes and more. Show your partner how you nurse and describe how it feels.Many new moms experience mood swings. However, if the baby blues last longer than two weeks or if you've become angry or resentful, talk to your doctor. When left untreated, depression can hurt milk production. A 2005 study in MCN: The American Journal of Maternal/Child Nursing found that mothers who are stressed, fatigued or depressed had lower prolactin levels in their milk and blood, which can decrease milk supply. Several antidepressants are compatible with breastfeeding, which means you don't need to quit nursing. Many experts agree breastfeeding actually enhances a woman's mental health. Ask your pediatrician to use growth charts specifically for breastfed babies. Healthy breastfed infants tend to grow more rapidly than formula-fed infants the first two to three months and less rapidly from 3 to 12 months. The key is to keep all of your well-baby visits so your doctor can track baby's weight. (Find weight charts for breastfed babies at <a href=""http://who.int/childgrowth/standards/en"">who.int/childgrowth/standards/en</a>.)Breastfeeding often gets blamed for sagging boobs, but actually it's pregnancy, weight gain and poor bra support that affect the shape and size of breasts. During pregnancy, the glandular tissue in breasts increases and the ligaments that support your boobs may stretch as your breasts get fuller. This stretching may contribute to sagging after pregnancy — whether or not you breastfeed. Breastfeeding and gradual weaning may help redeposit fat into the breasts and return them to more of a prepregnancy appearance. La Leche League says women who are more concerned with the shape of their bodies are less likely to want to breastfeed. “The longer a woman breastfeeds, the lower her risk for developing breast cancer, ovarian cancer, Type 2 diabetes or cardiovascular disease,” says Melissa Bartick M.D., an internal medicine physician in Massachusetts. Keva Zeigler, a breastfeeding peer counselor, says: “I tell women, ‘Take pride in your superpower. You make milk. You grow people.’”Untrue, says Williams Sears M.D., pediatrician and Babytalk contributing editor. Parents worry that nursing on demand will create clingy and dependent children. The truth is you can't spoil a baby by promptly meeting his needs or by breastfeeding, Dr. Sears says. The time it takes to mix, heat, feed and clean bottles, as well as having to shop for the formula, adds to the preparations, Zeigler says. “Moms I counsel will walk me through all of the steps they take to make a bottle or plan an errand,” Zeigler says. “Usually, I could have breastfed my baby by the time they're finished.”Two to 5 percent of babies experience thrush — a yeast infection in baby's mouth that can be transferred to your breasts — and, yes, it hurts. Call your pediatrician and get a prescription of antifungal medication for both of you. Air-dry your nipples after each feeding and wash bras daily. If both mom and baby are being treated, continue breastfeeding. If not, speak with your pediatrician about your options.Nursing in public can be done without drawing attention. Practice in front of family, other moms or even a mirror. A nursing cover (try Bébé au Lait brand, available at Motherhood Maternity) or nursing clothing (we like the selection at <a href=""http://milkstars.com/"">milkstars.com</a>) can help too.The first thing you'll need is a good breast pump. Electronic pumps are available for rent or purchase. Pumps and all breastfeeding supplies are tax-deductible, thanks to a new IRS ruling. For working moms who are paid hourly, work outdoors or have limited flexibility, pumping may be difficult. Fortunately, there are new laws to protect working women. In workplaces with more than 50 workers, employers are required to provide a private area and adequate breaks for nursing moms. If these laws don't apply to your workplace, get creative and be your own advocate. You may need to think of ways to reorganize your work to allow you to visit baby at noon for a lunch-break feeding, cut back your hours, suggest a different schedule or talk to your boss. (You may want to tell your boss that because breastfed babies have lower incidences of illnesses, you may use fewer sick days!) Some working mothers choose not to pump but to continue breastfeeding in the mornings and evenings — just know that this could affect your milk supply."

 Ask Dr. Sears: Vitamin Overdose,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-vitamin-overdose,"A It's important that your baby get the right amount of vitamins, since your baby needs adequate amounts of these nutrients for optimal growth. It is wise not to give your baby more than the recommended daily allowance—the RDA, also called daily value or DV. Yet, giving your baby an excess of most vitamins will cause no harm. Your baby will only excrete the excess in her urine. (Very high excess doses of vitamin A can be harmful, but only at approximately ten times the RDA.) The label on formula cans and food labels, such as some cereal boxes, list the RDA's of essential nutrients.Here's a rundown of the eleven most common vitamins, and their health benefits:Concerning the formula issue, all commercially available infant formulas contain the recommended amount of vitamins. If your baby gets 32 ounces of formula a day, then she is getting enough vitamins. If, however, she takes less than 32 ounces, a multi-vitamin supplement is recommended. When you start adding solid foods, she will also be getting vitamins from solids. You don't need to worry about her getting too much, as it's nearly impossible for baby to ""overdose"" on too much vitamins from foods.Breastfed babies generally do not need vitamin supplements. There is some new evidence that suggests some breastfeeding babies or their mothers, especially if they are African-American, may need vitamin D supplements during the winter months if they are not exposed to at least ten minutes of sunlight a day. Also infants with nutritional needs for catch-up growth, such as premature infants, usually need vitamin, mineral, and iron supplements for at least the first year.Besides vitamins, it's important that babies get enough minerals in their diet, which is why you will notice that some supplements are listed as a ""multi-vitamin/multi-mineral"" preparation. And one of the most important minerals to be sure your baby gets enough of is iron, especially after six months of age. At this point, babies begin to use up all their extra iron stores from the mothers blood at birth. This is why it's important to always use an iron-fortified formula, and not a ""low iron"" formula. Iron is necessary for your baby to make enough red blood cells. Your doctor will routinely measure your infant's iron levels in her hemoglobin around the nine-month well-baby checkup. Infant cereals are also fortified with vitamins and minerals. So, if your baby is taking 32 ounces of formula plus eating solid foods, you can be reassured that she has a vitamin-sufficient diet."
 My Baby Goes a Long Time Without Pooping—What Do I Do?,http://www.parenting.com/article/my-baby-goes-a-long-time-without-pooping--what-do-i-do,"Help for constipation<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/constipation"">Constipation</a> refers to the hardness of the stools and the difficulty passing them, and not so much the frequency of bowel movements. If your <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">baby</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> is not bloated or colicky, and isn't straining to have a bowel movement, it could just be that this is his normal intestinal pattern. Still, nine days without a bowel movement is a bit long. I suggest you keep track of his feeding patterns for a while. See if you can encourage him to have a stool more often. Here's how:If your baby is formula-fed, offer her an extra bottle of water each day. (Breastfed infants seldom need extra water.) I call this ""drinking to go."" Lack of fluids is one of the most common contributors to constipation. When a baby is not drinking enough, his colon steals water from the waste material and gives it to the body. This causes the stools to be water-deprived or hard.Formula-fed infants tend to have fewer and firmer stools. Ask your doctor about experimenting with different formulas. At three months, most infants will have a bowel movement at least every other day, and some will have several a day. A different formula could help your baby have a comfortable bowel movement at least every few days.Babies who are prone to constipation often experience problems with regular bowel movements when switching to solids. Holding off awhile will allow your child's digestive system to mature somewhat. When you introduce solids, start with stool-softening foods. Remember the four pureed P's: peaches, pears, plums and prunes. And try barley, instead of the more-constipating rice cereal.If your baby starts to grunt and strain to have a bowel movement, get some glycerin suppositories from your pharmacy. Insert the suppository at least an inch up into his rectum and hold Baby's buttocks together for a few minutes until it dissolves. You can also squirt a dropper of liquid glycerin into the rectum at the first sign of straining. Use these once a day for a couple weeks, until you've managed to soften the stools by dietary means. Liquid glycerin will also help heal tears in the rectum caused by constipation — fresh blood on a diaper is a sure sign of these tears.If extra water doesn't seem to work, other dietary changes could help in babies as young as 4-months-old. Diluted prune juice (one tablespoon in eight ounces of water) is a time-tested remedy. We use flax oil in our pediatric practice. Besides being a good source of extra omega-3 fats, flax oil is a natural laxative. Add one teaspoon to one of your baby's bottles once a day. Toddlers can have as much as a tablespoon a day.Constipation is very uncomfortable for infants and it becomes a self-perpetuating problem. The more constipated a baby gets, the more it stretches the colon, which further aggravates constipation. This is why it's important to identify and treat constipation early. The number of stools and their nature varies tremendously from baby to baby, so primarily you want to watch for any signs of straining. I remember when one of our infants became very constipated and needed all the above treatments. One day as Martha was helping Matthew ""deliver"" a hard stool, she said: ""I feel like a midwife."""
 Ask Dr. Sears: Baby's an Overenthusiastic Eater,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-babys-an-overenthusiastic-eater,"<br><b>A. </b>While it's wonderful that your baby isn't a picky eater, you are still wise to be concerned about the possibility of overfeeding. The current epidemic of childhood obesity has prompted pediatricians to take a closer look at early infant feeding practices. At 26 pounds, your baby is at the top of the growth chart for weight, so it's natural to be concerned. Here's what you can do to ensure your baby gets proper nutrition, without overfeeding her:</br>When I see a ""heavy"" baby who's breastfed, I seldom worry because these babies almost always slim down naturally between the first and second year. (In fact, most big babies, regardless of how they are fed, go through a normal leaning out period sometime during the second year.) Studies show that breastfed babies, even the ones considered overweight on the growth charts, are much less likely to be heavy as older children. Breastfeeding has natural obesity-preventing properties, likely due to instinctive stop-feeding cues that all breastfed babies have. Also, as you continue to nurse, the fat content of breast milk normally declines over time.If your baby is formula-fed, discuss the appropriate amount and type of formula to feed with her pediatrician. As a general guide, a 10-month-old baby will need about an ounce of formula per pound of weight per day.It's difficult to gain a harmful amount of weight when eating healthy foods. There are certain foods that babies can eat as much of as they want, which I call grow foods—and vegetables are a prime example. Steam and puree them for your baby. Since you are blessed with a non-picky eater who enjoys eating, let her eat as much vegetables as she wants. There are many parents who are not as lucky! By making your own baby food, you'll shape your child's tastes toward what good, wholesome food is supposed to taste like. There has been some concern that fruit (in my opinion, another great grow food) contains too much sugar. However, the high fiber content makes them more satisfying, so kids are less likely to overeat. Other healthy foods with a high satiety factor include eggs, avocados, lentils, oatmeal, seafood, whole grains, beans, and vegetables.Take a look at your family members—is obesity common? If so, your baby might be genetically prone to weight gain. But if lean body types dominate, she's at a lower risk. Even in infancy, there are different body types. ""Bananas"" (long and lean) are naturally calorie-burners, and will be less prone to becoming overweight. ""Apples"" (shorter and rounder at the middle) are at a higher risk for obesity. Figure out which body type your baby has, and make sure she eats right for her shape.Infants and toddlers tend to normally eat small, frequent meals, so continue to encourage that eating pattern. Grazers tend to be leaner, and eating less more often is also easier on the digestive system.As your baby grows, continue to think about portion size. Your baby's tummy is about the size of her fist. So, if you feed her one baby-sized fistful of food at a time, that will make for a more than adequate meal. "
 Ask Dr. Sears: Refusing Solid Foods,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-refusing-solid-foods,"A. Between 6 and 12 months of age, many babies go through a passing stage of refusing solids and favoring milk—either from the breast, or formula. This preference is likely due to the ease and familiarity of sucking from the breast or bottle versus the hard work of swallowing solid food. As long as your baby gets the nutrients she needs during this phase, there's no real cause for concern. Here's how to keep her healthy and encourage her to return to solids:Your baby needs about two ounces of formula per pound per day. Most 11-month-olds average around 32 to 36 ounces daily. As long as you feed her this amount during her solid-food strike, she'll get all the vitamins and minerals she needs.During an infant's first year, many of the calories for growth come from fat. Human milk is about 50 percent fat (yet another reason breast milk is best). If your baby's growth seems to be slowing, try increasing her intake of nutritious fats. Flax seed oil is a great supplement for children during temporary dietary downturns. Add two teaspoons to her formula (1/2 teaspoon to four bottles) daily. This provides around 80 extra calories a day. Avocado also contains lots of healthy fats and is a perfect food for babies. Mash up a little ripe avocado and let her eat it off your fingertip.For <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/a-guide-for-picky-eaters"">picky solid-food eaters</a>, stick with foods that pack the most nutritional punch in a small volume. Your best bets are avocado, yogurt, tofu, eggs (only after one year of age), veggies (such as carrots and squash) and flax seed oil.Perhaps your daughter is trying to tell you that she wants an upgrade in her cuisine! Many mothers say that once they switch from jarred baby food to homemade, their babies begin to eat more solids. Try giving your child the same fresh, healthy foods you eat: Purée fresh fruits, cooked vegetables, lean meats and seafood (such as wild salmon). By feeding her nutritious homemade food—the very food you eat—you're shaping her tastes from an early age. Today's childhood obesity epidemic (and subsequent nutrition-related illnesses, such as diabetes) is due in large part to children being raised without a taste preference for healthy foods. Instead, kids favor artificially sweetened and nutritionally deficient packaged foods. If you serve your baby freshly prepared foods as often as possible, she's more likely to grow up preferring those tastes and shunning packaged foods.Sit your daughter on your lap, put her puréed food on your own plate and try a bit of it yourself. This strategy capitalizes on an infant's desire to copy what you do. Seeing the food on your plate and watching you eating it should entice her to try it, too. Some babies just want to eat grown-up foods on grown-up plates!"
 No-Fuss Baby Food Safety Guide,http://www.parenting.com/article/no-fuss-baby-food-safety-guide,"Are you always digging a <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">bottle</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> or jar out of the fridge and wondering uneasily if it’s still good?<em>By Cynthia Stevens Graubart and Catherine Fliegel, R.N.</em> <strong>Breast Milk</strong><strong>How long you can keep it:</strong> <strong>At room temperature (66-72°F)</strong> The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the La Leche League say six to eight hours is fine if you don’t have a fridge handy.<strong>In a refrigerator</strong> The AAP recommends two to three days; the La Leche League agrees that’s best, but says up to eight days is acceptable.<strong>In the freezer </strong>The AAP recommends one month, especially if the freezer is opened frequently. The La Leche League says six months is safe. If you have a separate freezer that’s rarely opened, both agree that at least six months is safe, but don’t keep milk longer than a year.<strong>Breast milk safety secrets</strong><strong>•</strong> If your baby is a preemie or has health concerns, err on the side of caution, and keep milk refrigerated as much as possible.<strong>•</strong> Label each container of milk with the date it was stored.<strong>•</strong> Store the milk in the back of the fridge or freezer to minimize its exposure to warm air when you open the door.<strong>•</strong> Freeze about two to four ounces per container. Leave a little room at the top of the container to allow for expansion.<strong>•</strong> Thaw frozen milk slowly in the fridge for no more than 24 hours or in a bowl of warm water.<strong>•</strong> Never refreeze thawed milk.<strong>•</strong> Save milk left over from a feeding only if it’s a small amount and you plan to feed it to your baby within an hour or so.<strong>Formula</strong><strong>How long you can keep it:</strong><strong>Unopened cans of powdered, ready-to-feed, and concentrated liquid formula</strong> Keep up to the ""sell by"" or ""use by"" date printed on the container. Store at room temperature, out of direct sunlight. <strong>Opened cans of powdered formula</strong> You can store for up to one month (or according to the manufacturer's guidelines) in the refrigerator, says the AAP.<strong>Opened cans of ready-to-feed and concentrated liquid formula</strong> Keep for up to 48 hours. Store in the refrigerator, tightly covered.<strong>Prepared bottles of powdered formula</strong> Keep for up to 24 hours. Store in the refrigerator.<strong>Formula safety secrets:</strong><strong>•</strong> Is it safe? Don't buy any can of formula that has dents or bulges.<strong>•</strong> Give the top of the formula can a quick wipe before you open it to get rid of any dust or dirt. Clean the can opener before you use it, too, to avoid contamination.<strong>•</strong> Read the manufacturer's mixing instructions on the label, and follow the exact water-to-formula ratio.<strong>•</strong> You can prepare enough bottles for a whole day and take them out of the fridge as needed. Toss any leftovers.<strong>•</strong> Store the formula in the back of the fridge to minimize its exposure to warm air when you open the door.<strong>•</strong> Never freeze formula.<strong>•</strong> If you need to take prepared formula on an outing or trip, keep it in an insulated bag with a cold pack unless you know you'll definitely be using it within two hours of taking it out of the refrigerator.<strong>•</strong> Don't save formula in a bottle left over from a feeding to use another time; germs from your baby's mouth can contaminate the liquid and cause bacterial growth.<strong>•</strong> Don't rely on the sniff test to let you know if formula is still safe to drink; it may be odorless even if bad.<strong>Warm it up</strong> Bottles of formula are best heated up in a bowl of warm water or in a bottle warmer. Though it's dangerous to microwave bottles (it can create hot spots in the liquid that may scald your baby's mouth), let's be honest: Many moms still do it. If you do resort to zapping, make sure the bottle is microwave-safe, and remove the nipple or cap before heating for no more than three to five seconds per ounce. Shake the bottle and put some formula on your wrist to test the temp. Avoid nuking breast milk; it can damage its immune properties.<strong>To sterilize or not to sterilize</strong> <strong>Gear:</strong> Most experts will tell you to sterilize all your bottles, storage containers, nipples, rings, caps, and measuring cups at least before the first use by heating them in boiling water for five minutes. But many veteran moms (including a few <em>Babytalk</em> editors) skip this step and just run them through the dishwasher. Another good option: Medela sells Quick Clean Micro-Steam Bags that allow you to sterilize your stuff in the microwave in just three minutes. If there are concerns about your local water supply, though, your doctor may recommend sterilizing the gear after each use.<strong>Water:</strong> Your pediatrician may suggest that you boil the water you use to mix formula for the first few months to be safe, but others say not to worry about it unless you have well water or concerns about your local water supply. (Since your pediatrician will know about the quality of the water in your area, follow her recommendation.) To sterilize tap water, bring it to a boil for just one minute and let it cool down before mixing it with formula. You can buy sterilized bottled water, but bottled water is not sterile in general, so it's no better than tap in most cases. <strong>Solid Food</strong><strong>How long you can keep it:</strong>Some new types of organic and/or flash-frozen baby foods are sold in stores' freezer or refrigerator sections and must be kept cold, open or not. But most unopened jarred solids can be kept at room temperature. Once opened, here's how long you can store them: <strong>Strained fruits and vegetables</strong> Keep in the refrigerator for up to two to three days or in a freezer compartment with a separate door for as long as six to eight months.<strong>Strained meats</strong> Keep in the fridge for one day or in a freezer compartment with a separate door for up to one to two months.<strong>Meat/veggie combos</strong> Keep in the fridge for one to two days or in a freezer compartment with a separate door for one to two months.<strong>Solid food safety secrets</strong><strong>•</strong> Don't purchase sticky, cracked, or rusty jars, and make sure the safety button on the lid is down.<strong>•</strong> Give the top of the jar a quick wipe before you open it to get rid of any dirt.<strong>•</strong> Inspect the inside rim of the jar after opening for cracks or chips, and throw it away if you spot any; tiny shards of glass could be in the food.<strong>•</strong> Never nuke baby-food jars. If you need to heat the food, spoon it into a microwave-safe container first. After heating, stir well, then put a drop on your wrist or taste it yourself with a clean spoon (use a different spoon to feed your baby) to test the temp.<strong>•</strong> Don't serve food straight from the jar if you plan on saving part of it for later. Your baby's saliva can contaminate it. Spoon the amount you plan on feeding your baby into a separate bowl, and save the rest.<strong>•</strong> Store food in the back of the fridge/freezer to reduce its exposure to warm air when you open the door.<strong>•</strong> Freeze homemade baby food in an ice-cube tray, then store the frozen cubes in plastic freezer bags. <em>Cynthia Stevens Graubart and Catherine Fliegel, R.N. are freelance writers.</em>"
 Avoiding the Mistakes Even Smart Moms Make,http://www.parenting.com/article/how-to-avoid-baby-health-mistakes,"I consider myself a pretty <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">well</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> informed mom, yet I'll admit I've done some really stupid things with my 14-month-old.I fed her jarred sweet potatoes when she was just 3 months old, and that's at least a month earlier than the earliest time experts recommend for the first solid food. (But she was begging!)I've given her children's ibuprofen instead of the infant kind. (I couldn't read the label. It was 4 a.m. And it's really dark at that time of night!)Sure, there's some solace in knowing that even the most conscientious moms make health blunders from time to time. After all, the learning curve is pretty steep: One moment you're pregnant, and then suddenly you're supposed to be an expert on eczema and peanut allergies.The best defense against baby-health mistakes? Understanding moms' most common slipups  -- and what to do instead when it's your turn.<strong>Mistake: Wearing shoes inside the house</strong>Babies live on the floors and rugs  -- and right now you're tracking dirt, chemicals, and street germs on the bottom of your shoes. Babies also put every little thing they find in their mouths.<strong>Smart solution:</strong> Invite guests to relax and remove their shoes before entering your home. For those who won't, keep a high-quality mat outside to wipe off shoes and boots, and a softer mat inside the door to catch extra dirt particles.<em><br/></em>It's fine for most babies, but it isn't necessary. And if your child has sensitive skin, it might be best to give him a bath every other day. For some babies, daily baths can disrupt the skin's protective flora and cause pH imbalances, leading to an over-growth of bacteria or yeast or making the skin red, irritated, and dry, says dermatologist Sarah Boyce, M.D., assistant professor at the University of Alabama at Birmingham. If your baby has eczema, bathing can cause flare-ups.<strong>Smart solution:</strong> Many infants are fine with a nightly bath, but don't feel bad if you miss it. If your baby has sensitive skin, dry patches, or eczema, experiment with less tubtime. Trisha Creekmore of Washington, DC, bathes her daughter, Lily, now 3, just twice weekly: ""I felt guilty at first, but then I noticed that bathing her too much caused dry skin, so my neglect  -- or non-obsessive parenting, as I like to call it  -- turned out to be right for her.""<strong>Mistake: Assuming that caregivers understand the health instructions you give them</strong>Be explicit. One mom I know learned this the hard way. Her daughter, age 6 months, needed Zantac, the reflux medication, during the day, so she gave it to the director of the daycare center to administer. But a few months later when she asked the providers if they needed a refill, she got blank stares. They had just stopped giving it long before, without telling her.<strong>Smart solution:</strong> Whether it's the daycare staff, a babysitter, or your own mother, take a moment to write down the instructions in simple, direct language, and be precise. ""Don't say 'one or two pills' or 'only if he looks ill,' because a caregiver shouldn't be asked to make these decisions,"" says registered nurse Gloria Mayer, president of the Institute for Healthcare Advancement, in La Habra, California, which studies medical communication. Ask her to read your directions back to you to make sure you've been clear.My friend now puts in writing any health care instructions for her daughter and then gives a copy to everyone on the daycare staff. Plus one for the director.Especially dangerous: preparations that contain pseudoephedrine. ""It might make babies feel a little better, but not dramatically better, and the risk of side effects is very real,"" says Steven Kairys, M.D., chairman of the department of pediatrics at Jersey Shore University Medical Center, in Neptune, New Jersey. Complications range from simple hyperactivity to high blood pressure and irregular heartbeat.Whatever the medication, read the fine print. Elizabeth Smith of Alpharetta, Georgia, swore off Benadryl after it kept her son Ryan awake for 36 hours: ""The label isn't kidding when it says, 'Excitability may occur, especially in children'!""<strong>Smart solution:</strong> Some over-the-counter medications may be fine for babies, but get the green light from the doc first. Always do so before giving infant acetaminophen to a baby 3 months or younger (it can mask a fever, which requires immediate medical attention). For babies older than 3 months, it's fine to give infant acetaminophen without calling first to relieve teething discomfort, the pain of shots, and cold miseries. And you can make a sick baby more comfortable by giving her fluids, using saltwater drops to aspirate her nose, using a cold-water humidifier, and keeping her head slightly elevated when she's sleeping.<strong>Mistake: Sharing spoons and toothbrushes, or popping her paci in your mouth to ""clean it off""</strong>One bite for me, one for you and you get my mouth germs, too! Moms are a prime source of the germs that give babies tooth decay. But if you can keep those germs from establishing themselves in your baby's mouth (even before she has any teeth) you may protect her from the most common dental problems. ""Anything with saliva on it has the potential to transmit bacteria,"" says Washington, DC, periodontist Sally Cram, a spokesperson for the American Dental Association.<strong>Smart solution:</strong> Have your teeth cleaned by your dentist regularly, brush twice a day, floss once a day, and consider a fluoride mouthwash. If you chew gum, make it xylitol-sweetened. All reduce cavity-causing germs. And instead of sharing spoons with your child, just pretend to taste the food. When her daughter Laura was starting solids, Judith Basya of Santa Monica, California, put the spoon almost up to her mouth and said ""Yummy!"" Laura's now 1, and her mom's still pretending: ""At first I did it for sanitary reasons, but now I just don't want to eat her overcooked carrots!""Frequent formula changes can make it harder for your pediatrician to identify the true culprit, whether it's a milk allergy, acid reflux, or something else. When Mary Rose Almasi of Somers, New Jersey, would feed her newborn daughter, Grace would spit up and cry. The pediatrician advised switching to a non-milk-based formula to rule out an allergy. It didn't help, but eliminating allergy as a trigger let her doctor arrive at a diagnosis: reflux.<strong>Smart solution:</strong> Work with your pediatrician to find the cause of the problem, especially if your child's not gaining weight (or is losing it) or if you see blood in her stool (which might mean an allergy to milk-based formula). Changing the formula may well be one recommendation. For reflux, however, other approaches work better. When she's feeding, her lips should form a tight seal around the bottle's nipple so no air gets in; you may want to experiment with different kinds of nipples. Try keeping your baby upright for a half hour after feeding (Almasi found that the car seat worked like a charm), offer frequent small meals instead of fewer larger ones, make sure she's burping adequately (even if you have to interrupt feedings to burp her), and tuck some rolled towels underneath one end of her crib mattress to keep her on an incline. If your baby's a spitup artist, Almasi recommends ditching the swing and the vibrating bouncy seat, which she found ""jiggled my baby's little belly and brought up the spitup.""<strong>Mistake: Overbundling your baby to keep out the chill</strong>After the first few days, infants are quite good at regulating their own body temperature. Dressing them in too many layers can lead to dehydration and exhaustion, says Trina Austin, M.D., chief of pediatrics at Orange Coast Memorial Medical Center, in Fountain Valley, California. During sleep, becoming overheated can disrupt the ability to regulate breathing, increasing the risk of SIDS.<strong>Smart solution:</strong> Indoors or out, dress your baby in the same number of layers you're wearing. In the car or at home, set the air conditioner so it's not so frigid that you feel you need to bundle him up; when the weather cools, set the thermostat around 68 or 70 degrees F, no higher. Summer or winter, when your room temperature is comfortable for you, lightly dressed, it's fine for your baby. Telltale signs he's too warm? He may turn red in the face, sweat, or cry because he's uncomfortable.A baby's tiny lungs are very vulnerable to allergens, secondhand smoke, and gases emitted from new paint or furniture. Air fresheners don't help; they release pollutants that, in one study, were linked with diarrhea, earache, and other symptoms in some babies. And many electronic air ""cleaners"" don't clean well and emit ozone, an air pollutant.<strong>Smart solution:</strong> Open the windows in the baby's room for at least ten minutes a day. Houseplants (especially Boston fern, peace lily, and bamboo palms) clear carbon dioxide and chemical vapors. A bowl of baking soda absorbs odors, and fresh-cut flowers add good ones. Also, put high-efficient filters in your air conditioners (like 3M Filtrete, $15). As a last resort, buy an air-purifying HEPA machine, which doesn't emit ozone.<strong>Mistake: Not taking your infant's temperature when he seems sick</strong>Parents often skip the thermometer, claiming ""he didn't feel warm to me."" But the clinical sign of fever is an important hallmark for concern in really young babies, says Peter Tesler, M.D., director of pediatric ambulatory care at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City. A fever of 100.4° or more in a baby under 3 months means an infection and automatically triggers an office  -- and usually an emergency room  -- visit. Always call the doctor.<strong>Smart solution:</strong> If your baby seems under the weather, take his temperature with a rectal thermometer, which gives the most accurate reading until a child can hold a thermometer under his tongue (usually, around age 2). Karen Dunn of Ardmore, Pennsylvania, does so whenever her 5-month-old son, Nolan, seems ill or out of sorts. ""Most of the time there's no fever, and my husband teases me, but on several occasions my instincts were right,"" she says.<em>Aviva Patz, a mom of two girls in Montclair, New Jersey, continues to make mistakes every day, learning as she goes.</em>"

In the car or at home, set the air conditioner so it's not so frigid that you feel you need to bundle him up; when the weather cools, set the thermostat around 68 or 70 degrees F, no higher. Summer or winter, when your room temperature is comfortable for you, lightly dressed, it's fine for your baby. Telltale signs he's too warm? He may turn red in the face, sweat, or cry because he's uncomfortable.A baby's tiny lungs are very vulnerable to allergens, secondhand smoke, and gases emitted from new paint or furniture. Air fresheners don't help; they release pollutants that, in one study, were linked with diarrhea, earache, and other symptoms in some babies. And many electronic air ""cleaners"" don't clean well and emit ozone, an air pollutant.<strong>Smart solution:</strong> Open the windows in the baby's room for at least ten minutes a day. Houseplants (especially Boston fern, peace lily, and bamboo palms) clear carbon dioxide and chemical vapors. A bowl of baking soda absorbs odors, and fresh-cut flowers add good ones. Also, put high-efficient filters in your air conditioners (like 3M Filtrete, $15). As a last resort, buy an air-purifying HEPA machine, which doesn't emit ozone.Parents often skip the thermometer, claiming ""he didn't feel warm to me."" But the clinical sign of fever is an important hallmark for concern in really young babies, says Peter Tesler, M.D., director of pediatric ambulatory care at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City. A fever of 100.4° or more in a baby under 3 months means an infection and automatically triggers an office—and usually an emergency room—visit. Always call the doctor.<strong>Smart solution:</strong> If your baby seems under the weather, take his temperature with a rectal thermometer, which gives the most accurate reading until a child can hold a thermometer under his tongue (usually, around age 2). Karen Dunn of Ardmore, Pennsylvania, does so whenever her 5-month-old son, Nolan, seems ill or out of sorts. ""Most of the time there's no fever, and my husband teases me, but on several occasions my instincts were right,"" she says."
 7 Ways to Prevent Obesity,http://www.parenting.com/article/7-ways-to-prevent-obesity,"How to stop weight problems when she's a <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">baby</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>Living Lean Take her outside—and more tips to stop weight problems before they start, by William Sears, M.D., a contributing editor and the author of more than 40 childcare booksThe first years of your child's life instill habits that can last a lifetime. That's why it's so important to teach ways to ""live lean"" during this impressionable stage. Babies are naturally plump, of course—that adorable, pinchable layer of fat insulates your little one's body from the elements and provides fuel for the ""play first, eat later"" toddler years. Most babies lose their chubbiness when they start to crawl and walk, but here are some guidelines to make sure your tot keeps the baby fat at bay—for life.Of course, the very best thing you can do to help your child maintain a healthy weight is to set a good example. If you're passionate about eating right and staying fit, your child will emulate your good habits. Remember, you have more influence over him in these first years of life than at any other time, so take advantage of this opportunity to give him the tools for a healthy lifestyle.Breastfed babies not only ""lean out"" sooner, they're also less likely to become obese later in childhood. What's more, the longer a baby breastfeeds, the better her chances of growing up at a healthy weight. That's because breastfeeding teaches her not to overeat. When she feels full, she naturally slows down or stops nursing. This helps her identify her hunger signals and regulate the amount she eats at each meal, a habit she's likely to carry into childhood.Breastfeeding also keeps your baby from equating food with comfort. After he fills up on breast milk, he may continue to suckle, but in a slow way that gives very little milk. As a result, he learns to associate the good feelings that come from sucking with the warm sensation of being held in your arms, not with having a too-full tummy.Without baby-to-breast contact, bottle-feeding may be less intuitive than breastfeeding, but you still can help your child develop healthy eating habits by following his feeding cues. Offer formula when he's hungry, not according to a schedule—a young baby's tummy is about the same size as his  fist, which means he'll do better with smaller, more frequent feedings. By the same token, let him decide when he's full. There's no need for him to finish the last ounce or half-ounce in the bottle if he's not interested. If he's simply crying for comfort, use music, massage or rocking instead of a bottle to soothe him.Follow this pattern once she starts eating solids too—just because she's eating table foods doesn't mean she needs to clean her plate. Smaller, more frequent meals are perfectly fine for your growing baby. Allowing a child to stop eating when her hunger is satisfied teaches her to trust her eating cues, helping to prevent overeating from becoming a habit.<b></b>Once your baby is ready for table foods (at about 6 months), watch for corn syrup (or high-fructose corn syrup) and hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils (a source of unhealthy trans fats)—a duo of factory-made ingredients found in many processed snack foods that provide empty calories. Foods that depend on these for flavor and texture teach children to prefer sweeter, fattier fare, putting them on the road to being overweight. Make it a habit to check the label before you buy, and avoid foods that have the ""terrible two""—instead, look for foods labeled ""saturated-fat free"" or ""contains no trans-fats"", or give your little one healthier snacks like fresh fruit and vegetables.Fruit juice provides vitamins and energy, but too much can displace more nutritious foods, such as fresh fruit and milk, in a child's diet. Limit infants 6 to 12 months old to no more than 4 ounces of juice per day, and 1- to 4-year-olds to no more than 6 ounces per day. Look for labels that say ""100-percent fruit juice,"" and avoid juice ""drinks,"" ""cocktails"" and ""punches,"" which contain lots of sugar but relatively little real fruit juice. Also steer clear of beverages that contain artificial sweeteners, colors and/or flavors.Even 100-percent fruit juice tends to be very sweet, so it's a good idea to mix your tot's juice with a bit of water. A good rule of thumb is to offer him plain water to quench thirst and for a sweet treat, offer diced fruit instead.Babies need fat—it's the most nutrient-rich food, providing the most calories in the smallest volume. Optimal development of the brain and other vital organs requires infants and toddlers to eat more fat proportionally than adults do.Focus on giving your baby healthy fats, like those found in breast milk or infant formula enriched with DHA (an omega-3 fatty acid) and ARA (an omega-6 fatty acid). When he's ready for table foods, offer salmon, egg yolk and avocado. I call these ""grow foods"" because they promote healthy development of the brain  and nervous system while also helping to strengthen the heart and immune system.Stay away from packaged ""low-fat"" foods. Fat is a potent flavor-booster, so when it's taken out, manufacturers often add more sugar or sodium to make up for the lack of taste. Save the skim milk for later: Babies need whole milk for a full year after their first birthday. (Never give cow's milk to an infant under 12 months.) Once your toddler turns 2, you can introduce reduced-fat milk, or low-fat  milk for children with a family history of obesity.<b></b>Like fats, carbohydrates are a necessary part of your child's diet—they give her energy to play and grow—but the carbs she consumes should be nutritionally sound. When your baby starts on solids, give her the fiber- and protein-packed carbohydrates found in whole-grain bread, fiber-rich cereals and fresh fruits  and vegetables, not the empty carbs found in sweetened beverages and many packaged foods that lack the protein, fat and fiber needed to truly satisfy hunger. Because ""good-carb"" foods are filling, she'll be less likely to overeat. Plus, teaching her to prefer the flavor and texture of healthier carbs at a young age can help her develop smart eating habits for life. To tell which carbs are the right ones, check the label and favor those foods with a high proportion of fiber and protein (at least 3 grams of each) in relation to overall carbohydrates.Once they discover their own mobility, most babies are only too happy to stay on the go, but you should get in on the act too—make playtime a special bonding time for the two of you, and your baby will learn to love being active. Get down on his level and play: Lie on  the floor and let him climb on you, or crawl around with him and chase each other around the house. Once he starts walking, make a stroll outdoors a regular routine for the whole family. You can even make watching TV an active experience—watch with him, and play games and  dance along with the characters on the program. Keep it fun, and you'll keep him moving. "
 Breastfeeding in the Modern Age,http://www.parenting.com/article/breastfeeding-modern-age,"Find out why choosing to nurse has become such a public issue.  Plus surprising breastfeeding tips, tricks, and <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">facts</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> of today.  I am sitting on a patch of grass in a public park—topless . Well, almost. The one thing between my boobs and the roughly 1.5 million Chicago Marathon spectators surrounding me is my husband's tissue-thin windbreaker.Beads of perspiration (hey, it's 84 degrees outside) make pumping under a jacket a slippery operation, but I wasn't going to let breastfeeding my then 3-month-old daughter get in the way of cheering my sister across the finish line.Let me tell you, ladies: Breastfeeding. Takes. Commitment. And not just the emptying-engorged-breasts-in-the-presence-of-millions-of-people kind of commitment. We're talking about attaching yourself (literally) to either your baby or your breast pump in an era when a successful businesswoman (Yahoo! CEO Marissa Mayer, you know who you are!) announces she's going to work through some of her maternity leave—a move that may make <em>your</em> boss wonder why you're not doing the same. It's a commitment that means dealing with anyone and everyone's opinion. The longer you nurse (which is really the goal here, right?) the more likely the reaction will be amazement or disgust. Just ask Jamie Lynne Grumet, who nursed her then 3-year-old son on <em>Time</em> magazine's cover. Here's the deal: Breastfeeding is more in the spotlight than ever. Beyoncé, Angelina, and Gwen Stefani have done it—openly. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), the World Health Organization (WHO), and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) urge all mothers to do it. Heck, the IRS is even paying people to do it, announcing tax breaks for breast pumps last year. But there are still plenty of moms—one of every four—who start their babies on formula and never look back. “We can celebrate the fact that breastfeeding rates have been rising since 1990, but our work isn't done,” says Cria Perrine, Ph.D., a CDC public-health expert focusing on infant feeding. “Seventy-five percent of women start breastfeeding in the hospital, but only 44 percent are breastfeeding at six months. And there are racial disparities—74 percent of Caucasian and more than 80 percent of Hispanic and Asian moms breastfeed for at least some period of time, but just over half of black mothers do. We're obviously not giving all women the support they need.”How has such a personal choice become such a public issue? First, medical experts today roundly agree that babies are best served by breast milk for their first six months of life. The AAP recommends that babies continue to drink breast milk once they start solids, until at least 12 months, touting benefits to the infants' immune systems including fewer ear infections, plus added protection against sudden infant death syndrome. But even as a mom who had success providing her child with breast milk through year one, hitting that goal alone is a challenge. Our glimmer of hope? The digital age is transforming the way we approach breastfeeding. Yes, pump technology has improved, and that's a big help to those of us who are on the go (aka, <em>every</em> mom), but Twitter, Facebook, smartphone apps, blogs, even text messaging mean that moms in the trenches (like me) can share in ways they never did before. “Moms can tweet me questions at three a.m.,” says Nancy Holtzman, R.N., VP of clinical content and education at parenting resource center Isis Parenting, who also has a dynamic Twitter following of 1,000 moms (follow her on @nancyholtzman). “I'll answer it by the time they wake up.” Google “breastfeeding blogs,” and you'll get more than 8 million results, not to mention hundreds of Facebook groups including “Real Men Support Breastfeeding” and “If Breastfeeding Offends You, Put a Blanket Over YOUR Head.” In fact, when a Houston-area mom was asked by a Target employee to move from the women's clothing section to a fitting room to nurse her 5-month-old son last winter, one of her mom pals set up a Facebook group to mobilize a “nurse-in.” Within days, the group attracted 6,700 followers, resulting in public-breastfeeding protests at roughly 250 Target stores across the country.But while breastfeeding advocates are more outspoken than ever, some modern moms still haven't gotten the memo that there are tons of resources at their fingertips. While some women don't want to nurse and a small percentage aren't able to, many women throw in the burp towel simply because they lack support. Here, common breastfeeding pitfalls—and ways to overcome them:<strong>1.</strong> <strong>Lack of info.</strong> Women aren't getting the message that breast is best. In fact, some hospitals don't even have lactation consultants available for daily rounds. “Research shows that when you don't start breastfeeding in the hospital, you aren't likely to start later,” says Perrine.<strong>What you can do:</strong> Learn the breastfeeding basics before the hungry babe arrives. Websites like Kelly Mom (<a href=""http://kellymom.com/"">kellymom.com</a>) contain great tips, including positions to try when starting out. Some branches of Women, Infants and Children (WIC), the federal program supporting low-income mothers, offer lactation consultants who pay complimentary visits to new moms in the hospital, too—call yours to see if you're eligible. When shopping hospitals, call around to see which ones have lactation consultants visiting with new moms daily.<strong>2.</strong> <strong>It's hard work.</strong> Some women try to breastfeed and truly can't—this includes the 5 percent of moms who have a low milk supply, often due to glandular problems (prior breast surgery could be a factor). But plenty of moms mistakenly think they can't make enough milk—when in fact their baby just needs help latching more effectively or is going through a growth spurt.<strong>What you can do:</strong> Some WIC-affiliated lactation consultants make free house calls for latching problems or pain. If you can, spring for a session with an International Board Certified Lactation Consultant—they may charge between $20 and $200 per session, but some insurance plans cover the cost. Find one at <a href=""http://ilca.org/"">ilca.org</a>. (To troubleshoot common problems yourself, see page 78.)<strong>3.</strong> <strong>And it's hard at work.</strong> While breast milk may be free—saving upward of $1,200 a year in formula costs—breastfeeding isn't, especially for working women. The Family and Medical Leave Act ensures 12 weeks of job protection for new mothers in workplaces of 50 people or more, but no promise of paid leave. Pumping is easier courtesy of 2010 legislation that requires companies to provide women with a clean, quiet place to breastfeed, but the law doesn't cover small workplaces or require employers to pay women during pumping breaks.<strong>What you can do:</strong> Talk to your boss and human resources rep about your breastfeeding plans in your second trimester. Try to negotiate as much paid leave as possible—you may want to tack on vacation days. Push for the creation of a clean, private space to pump milk, if there isn't one (the ladies' room, by law, doesn't count). If you're an hourly worker, see if you can come in early or stay late at work to make up for pumping breaks.<strong>4.</strong> <strong>It's completely foreign to me.</strong> “Most mothers today were born at a time when formula-feeding was the norm,” says Nancy Mohrbacher, a certified lactation consultant and author of <em>Breastfeeding Made Simple</em>. “Women often turn to their mothers for guidance, and if there's no experience there, there may be no support.”<strong>What you can do:</strong> Make breast friends. The La Leche League (<a href=""http://llli.org/"">llli.org</a>) links nursing moms through local support, and Breastfeeding USA (<a href=""http://breastfeedingusa.org/"">breastfeedingusa.org</a>) connects women with “breastfeeding counselors,” experienced mothers who've gone through a four- to six-month training program. The Black Mother's Breastfeeding Association has a Facebook page where moms trade tips. “Breastfeeding can be isolating,” says Mohrbacher. “But the more you surround yourself with other moms who are doing it, too, the more you'll understand your experiences are normal.”Everywhere you turn, somebody's girls are making news. A look at the latest boob battles:<strong>How long is too long?</strong> <em>Jamie Lynne Grumet's then 3-year-old son climbed on a chair to latch on for</em> Time <em>magazine's May 21 cover, setting off a firestorm of ewws and aahs.</em><strong>Nanny state or helping hand?</strong> <em>About 600 hospitals across the country have banned formula swag bags, and Rhode Island and Massachusetts have made it illegal for hospitals to give out free formula. New York City recently launched itself into the headlines with the Latch On NYC law that restricts access to infant formula by hospital staff, tracks formula distribution, discontinues the distribution of free infant formula, and prohibits promotional materials about formula in and around the hospital.</em><strong>What's the deal, Zuckerberg?</strong> <em>Want to show off your new boob job in a bikini to your 500 closest friends? Go for it. Want to show your family how you feed your infant? Forget it. Facebook continues to come under fire for removing “inappropriate” photos of nursing moms.</em><strong>You nursed where?</strong> <em>Breastfeeding mamas caused a stir last winter when they organized simultaneous “nurse-ins” at Target stores across the country. This August, they went one step further, gathering in Washington, D.C., for the first-ever Great American Nurse-in—a huge display of nursing in public.</em><strong>Most likely to breastfeed:</strong> California, Oregon, Washington<strong>Least likely to breastfeed:</strong> West Virginia, Mississippi, Louisiana "

NYC’s Mayor Bloomberg announced the initiative shortly after the <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/natural-parenting/new-aap-breastfeeding-guidelines-six-months-best-babies-and-it-takes-village"" target=""_blank"">AAP released its new breastfeeding recommendations,</a> which cite an ever-growing body of data supporting breastfeeding’s benefits to babies, moms, and the economy, and stressed hospitals' important role in this picture. His initiative also followed the public appeal of <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/natural-parenting/taylor-newman/should-hospitals-give-free-formula-new-moms"" target=""_blank"">dozens of consumer and health organizations, to hospitals</a>, to stop doling out corporate formula swag bags to every new mom they discharge. Breastfeeding’s health benefits are indisputable, as are its dismal rates among American moms. On the up-side, however, studies have shown repeatedly that exposure to information about breastfeeding increases moms’ desire to give it a whirl. And early, hands-on support (followed by a supportive workplace and public sphere) helps make it really happen. Since US health officials hope to almost double the nursing count by 2020, hospitals seem like the logical place to start. It surprises me that Latch On NYC has received such vocal criticism. And frankly, much of the recent criticism is based more in the alleged “Breastfeeding Debates” and their crossfire than in, you know, reality.More on that in a minute. First, here’s the <a href=""http://www.nyc.gov/html/doh/downloads/pdf/ms/initiative-description.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Latch On NYC</a> Plan: In addition to a pro-breastfeeding public transport poster campaign (not the first in the country by any means), voluntarily complying hospitals will: What this means is:Nurses must document the dispensing of formula to new moms, citing a medical reason for its necessity. I.e. nurses will need to actually talk with new moms, and provide them with information and support in trying to breastfeed before they hand out formula. Given the<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/natural-parenting/taylor-newman/should-hospitals-give-free-formula-new-moms"" target=""_blank""> difficulty I had in getting any breastfeeding support</a> after my NYC hospital delivery, I would have welcomed some policy backing my requests. But for new moms who just plain don’t want to breastfeed, this definitely represents a change of tides... not by much, though. No one will be forced to breastfeed if they truly don’t want to, obviously. This policy provides an official way to hold hospitals accountable, rather than to condemn womens’ choices. In fact, the initiative clearly states that “Mothers who decide to formula feed and cannot afford formula will be referred to WIC (Women, Infants and Children), a food and nutrition program for low-income families.” I.e. the government is still giving out free formula to those who want to feed it to their babies but can’t afford to buy it. This is hardly an anti-formula-feeding campaign. (But it definitely is a pro-breastfeeding one).Next up, limiting formula access means only that there’ll be an extra step between a mom delivering her baby and a nurse handing her formula. Namely, the mom will need to ask for it. Again, I read this as a way to hold hospitals accountable for attending to each patient personally.Finally, Discontinuing corporate swag (promotional materials and actual formula) is a big deal, and a huge step. <a href=""http://www.nypost.com/p/news/opinion/opedcolumnists/bloomy_bottle_boner_rCg0FYQGvEWauYeoCf5LuN"" target=""_blank"">Karol Markowicz’s (of the New York Post) opinion </a>that “a mother isn’t going to choose to feed her baby formula because she got a free lanyard or tote bag” notwithstanding, the fact is that corporations are, by definition, the opposite of charitable organizations; they vie for access to new moms in-hospital because, a) brand loyalty is not to be underestimated, and b) mothers assume hospitals have their patients’ (i.e. the moms and babies they care for) best interests at heart; so if a given formula is provided – along with “informational literature” – actually IN the hospital, that formula must be, by affiliation, a baby's-best-interest choice. (It's a subconscious, logical conclusion.) Of course babies can, and do, thrive on formula, but there’s no debate in the medical field as to breast milk’s nutritional superiority. By providing education and support around breastfeeding, and removing formula manufacturers from the picture, hospitals are actually operating with increased professional integrity; they are <em>actually</em> providing the best possible care to patients. And in some cases, this will mean providing formula to babies… Is it really so horrible that this won’t come with a bunch of PR from Nestle? No.As far as the controvery and crossfire is concerned, the Post’s Karol Markowicz, despite her anything-but-objective objections to the initiative, made one apt, if obnoxiously-presented, point in her critique. Lisa Paladino, of Staten Island University Hospital, had been quoted in<a href=""http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/mayor_knows_breast_WqU1iYRQvwbEkDuvn0vb1H"" target=""_blank""> this other Post article</a>, explaining that under the new system, a nurse will need to sign out each bottle of formula issued. Markowicz writes, “Perhaps Paladino has never been around a hungry infant, but she should anticipate a cacophony of screams while perpetually understaffed hospitals find nurse’s aides to sign out formula like it’s morphine.” While her analogy is rather unhinged, her point about understaffing is important; I was really kind of freaked out, post-delivery, by how little the nurses seemed to care for – or even check on –  my well-being. When the ‘nurse button’ proved pointless, I ended up hobbling down the hallway, barefoot, in search of a glass of drinking water. I was, meanwhile, nervous about my own abilities with a newborn, and the lack of nurse oversight made me afraid that if my baby needed something while with me in my room (something even more urgent than breastfeeding support, which definitely wasn't forthcoming), there wouldn't be a good way to get medical help... In a hospital. Yeah.<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/natural-parenting/taylor-newman/should-hospitals-give-free-formula-new-moms"" target=""_blank""> I <em>know</em> my breastfeeding experience – and entire post-delivery experience – would have been improved with better post-natal care</a>, along with one-on-one breastfeeding help. Bloomberg’s initiative, along with the recent research pointing to the crucial role that hospitals play in breastfeeding success, will hopefully motivare hospitals to equip themselves with adequate nursing staffs in order to really attend to helping new moms get their bearings – around breastfeeding, and otherwise. If they don’t, this plan could backfire. But if they do, and it succeeds, it could prove to be a positive model for hospitals to follow, nation-wide.For her part, Markowicz has little else to offer. She dubs Bloomberg’s initiative an “anti-formula crusade” and writes that breastfeeding hardly needs a policy-backed boost, stating, “a mere 50 years ago, 75 percent of American infants were using formula; breastfeeding was the odd way to feed a child.” True, but fifty years ago – 1962 – was not exactly a progressive time in American history, particularly for women and babies: <a href=""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thalidomide"" target=""_blank"">Thalidomide</a> for morning sickness? <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tzxs5qPsqX4"" target=""_blank"">Twilight Sleep births</a>? Hello? Markowicz has cited the least natural point in mainstream American birth practices as a way to ostensibly ‘naturalize’ formula feeding’s prime place in our hospitals today. It's a flimsy argument, and a strange respose to a (voluntary) change in policy here in 2012.Those who are <a href=""http://www.examiner.com/article/michael-bloomberg-wants-hospitals-to-hide-baby-formula-force-breastfeeding"" target=""_blank"">kicking up (badly-written, and poorly supported) dust</a> around Latch On NYC are fueling negativity for its own sake, as well as divisiveness for the sake of attention (and page views, which add up to advertising sales). Let’s not get sucked in. At the end of the day, the post-delivery hospital stay is, under normal circumstances, quite brief. A couple of days won’t keep formula-minded moms from feeding their babies formula. But it can make all the difference in getting moms who want to breastfeed onto a successful track. And greater numbers of successfully breastfeeding babies will make for a healthier population of babies, and moms, overall. This is a fact. This is why Bloomberg jumped in to this incredibly controversial territory – breastfeeding issues <em>and</em> corporate interests in health care (wow, double-whammy) – in the first place. Getting swept up in demonizing him, or in any uproar around this new policy, distracts from what the initiative really means for new moms (more support) and for hospitals (step it up).It’s going to be okay! It’s not 1962 anymore.What do you think of the Latch On NYC initiative? What do you think all the uproar is really about?"

Before you know it, she'll be gobbling up everything in sight.<strong>4 to 6 months</strong><span class=""blue10b""><strong>Breast milk/formula</strong></span><strong><br/></strong>The bulk of your baby's nutrition comes from breast milk or formula  -- about 32 ounces a day, which means 6 to 8 nursing sessions or 4 to 5 bottles. Solids should only complement, not replace, her liquid diet.<span class=""blue10b""><strong>Watch for</strong></span><strong><br/></strong>You'll know the time is right if your baby holds her head up well, sits with little support, and shows interest in food. She should also be past the ""tongue thrust"" stage, where she pushes the food out of her mouth as soon as it comes in. Be aware that it can take days for her to learn to swallow those early meals. If your baby rejects your attempts, just give up and try again in a few days.<span class=""blue10b""><strong>Start with</strong></span><strong><br/></strong>Iron-fortified rice cereal is the best first food because it's the most easily tolerated. Pick a time when your little one is in a happy mood  -- right before the second feeding of the day is a good time to start. (If she's starving, take the edge off with a short nursing session or a small bottle.) Try a tablespoon or two of cereal mixed to a thin consistency with breast milk or formula. Don't worry if most of the cereal dribbles down her chin  -- for the time being, she's getting used to the new texture.<span class=""blue10b""><strong>Move to</strong></span><strong><br/></strong>After several days of rice (and no adverse reaction), go on to other single-grain cereals like oatmeal and barley  -- and then fruits, veggies, or meats  -- a tablespoon or two once or twice a day. It doesn't matter which you try first, though you can ask your doctor whether she prefers a specific schedule or pattern.<span class=""blue10b""><strong>Avoid</strong></span><strong><br/></strong>Don't introduce too many new things at once. Give her each item for three to four days and watch for any reaction, like a rash, vomiting, or diarrhea. (If you notice any of these, call the doctor.) Try not to force food  -- if she isn't interested, just try again tomorrow. You can stay germ-free by scooping out portions into a bowl, rather than dipping the spoon from the jar to her mouth.<strong>Breast milk/formula</strong><br>Your baby will drink a bit less, but this is still his main source of nutrition-24 to 32 ounces of liquid (4 to 5 bottles or 5 to 8 nursings of breast milk).</br><strong>Watch for</strong><br>He's honing his pincer, or thumb-and-finger, grasp now, so toward the end of this stage you can begin to give him some practice: Set out tiny bits of soft food such as ripe banana or avocado (¼ inch in size, or no bigger than your pinkie nail). Cheerios, a good first finger food, are fine to try around 8 or 9 months. Not every new food will be a hit  -- it may take 10 to 15 tries to get your baby to eat something that's unfamiliar.</br><strong>Start with</strong><br>Cereal and new single-ingredient foods should continue, and you can also mix familiar ones together (peaches and oatmeal, for example) or try ""combo"" or ""second stage"" jars if he's had all of the ingredients listed. Offer solids twice a day; if he's interested in more (and eating a total of two to four tablespoons at each meal), work up to a third meal.</br><strong>Move to</strong><br>Thicker textures are next  -- whole-milk yogurt, cottage cheese, and tofu. As your baby gets the hang of finger foods, you can increase the variety (continue to offer tiny pieces). Try pasteurized cheese; small bits of well-cooked peas, beans, broccoli, and sweet potato; soft whole-wheat pasta and bread; and soft, very ripe fruits such as melon or peaches. How much food does he need now? Let your baby be your guide  -- some days he'll polish off entire jars, and other times he'll eat half as much. Don't force him to eat more.</br><strong>Avoid</strong><br>Memorize the most common choking hazards and share them with family and babysitters. Four ounces of juice a day (100 percent, no sugar added) can be offered now (diluted with water if desired), but whole fruits are more nutritious. Try serving juice (or water) in a sippy or regular cup, rather than a bottle.</br><strong>Breast milk/formula</strong><br>Feedings will diminish to about 3 or 4 bottles or 4 to 6 times at the breast, totaling 16 to 24 ounces of liquid.</br><strong>Watch for</strong><br>Your tot's more mobile  -- crawling, reaching, pulling up. Resist feeding her on the go, since she could choke if she's trying to toddle and eat at the same time. Limit car snacking, too, as you can't see her well from the driver's seat. Strapped into the high chair while supervised is the safest spot for meals.</br><strong>Start with</strong><br>Keep up the variety of tiny pieces of food: soft cooked pasta shapes; shredded chicken or turkey (no skin); soft cooked vegetables; ripe fruit; toast or bread; fish (once a week); soft pasteurized cheese; and hard-cooked or scrambled egg yolks.</br><strong>Move to</strong><br>By the first year, strive to serve as much ""table food"" as you can, weaning away from jars. Three meals a day is the goal at this stage.</br><strong>Avoid</strong><br>Cow's milk and honey are off limits in the first year because milk proteins and fat aren't easily digested before age 1 and honey may contain the bacteria that cause botulism. Other foods that can trigger an allergic reaction include products with tree nuts (cashews, walnuts, pecans, almonds), peanuts and nut butters, egg whites, shellfish, and citrus fruits. Most doctors recommend waiting until after the first birthday (or longer if there's a family history of allergies) to try these.</br><strong>Breast milk/formula</strong><br>Whole cow's milk (not skim or low-fat; fat is essential for brain growth) replaces formula or supplements nursing  -- about three 8-ounce servings per day.</br><strong>Watch for</strong><br>Don't be alarmed if your baby goes on a food jag (only pasta and peas, no fruit for days). While you wait for this ""picky phase"" to pass, consider the foods she's eaten over the course of a week rather than on one day. Also, around the first birthday growth tends to slow down a bit, so you can expect her appetite to decrease as well.</br><strong>Start with</strong><br>Offer a variety of healthy foods three times a day. A rough guide to the amount she'll eat in a day: 4 to 8 tablespoons of fruits and vegetables, 4 servings of breads and cereals (a serving is ¼ slice of bread, 2 tablespoons of rice, pasta, etc.), and 2 tablespoons of protein, such as meat or poultry.</br><strong>Move to</strong><br>Get into the habit of eating together with your baby at least once a day, if possible. She'll enjoy the socializing that comes with mealtime and will start to look forward to this routine each day.</br><strong>Avoid</strong><br>You know soda has no place in your baby's daily diet. Be just as cautious with high-fat and sugar-loaded items. By choosing healthy foods now, you'll teach your baby to prefer them later in life.</br>"
 How does the Due Date Calculator work?,http://www.parenting.com/article/how-does-the-due-date-calculator-work-21354528,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekOur formula for calculating your due date is based on the first day of your last menstrual period (LMP), and is the most common formula currently used by ob-gyns and midwives. You may also calculate by the exact date of conception, if you happen to know it, but because this circumstance is understandably rare, most due date calculation is based on the LMP. Here is what you may find surprising about this formula (and about the first few weeks of our Weekly Views): The first two weeks counted as part of the pregnancy usually actually precede ovulation and fertilization, which usually takes place in Week 3. That is how the convention works. Your due date is an estimated date, based on 40 weeks from the date of your LMP, since women commonly give birth between Weeks 38 and 42. If your ob-gyn or midwife alters your projected due date based on later developmental observation (such as that yielded by a sonogram), please go to the Settings &amp; Profile page to enter the new due date and keep your personalized information up-to-date."

""Once a woman decides to bottle-feed, she should be supported,"" emphasizes British researcher Rajalakshmi Lakshman, M.D. After all, lack of information can lead to mistakes, she notes, and those mistakes can have health consequences. Some common misunderstandings:<strong>You don't have to sterilize</strong> Unless you're worried about the cleanliness of your water, simply wash bottles and parts with soap and hot water or in the dishwasher, including before the first use.<strong>The powder-to-water ratio matters</strong> Follow the preparation instructions to the letter. Using more water to ""stretch"" formula can result in seizures; using less can result in dehydration and obesity.<strong>Switching formulas may not help fussiness</strong> Only a small percentage of infants truly need a specialized type of formula, but talk to your pediatrician if your baby is having frequent digestive difficulty and seems to be especially unhappy."

 Easy Money: Boosters for your Bank,http://www.parenting.com/article/easy-money-boosters-for-your-bank-1204063737869,"We all know that new parents spend a bundle (more than $6,000) in their baby's first year alone, with much of it going toward diapers, wipes, and formula. The average baby uses 2,500 <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">disposable</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> diapers a year, at a cost of $500. And even if you switch between breast- and bottle-feeding, you can easily spend hundreds of dollars on formula. We asked Alan Fields, author of the best-seller Baby Bargains, to tell us how to get the most for our baby bucks:<strong>Diapers and Wipes</strong><br/><strong>Go Generic.</strong> ""The quality of store-brand diapers has gotten much better over the past few years,"" says Fields. ""And they're usually made by the same manufacturers of brand-name diapers."" Wal-Mart's White Cloud, as well as the Target and Babies ""R"" Us store brands, are good choices.<br/><strong>Buy in Bulk.</strong> This is the cheapest way to go. You can get a 216-pack of size 1 diapers at Costco for $27, or 13 cents per diaper, a steal compared with paying 20 cents per diaper at the grocery store-a savings of more than $100 a year, says Fields. The popular Costco Kirkland Signature baby wipes cost less than 3 cents per wipe when you buy a 704-count box. But bulk shopping is not for everyone-you'll have to shell out a yearly membership fee (about $40) and have room to store large boxes.<br/><strong>Consider Cloth.</strong> And we aren't talking about your grandma's cloth diapers. ""The new generation of cloth diapers is much better at stopping leaks and is easier to launder,"" says Fields. Though the idea of buying used diapers may seem a bit odd, it will save you money. Look for them online on cloth-diapering message boards and your local Craigslist website. (Wash in hot water before using on your own baby.) Laundering them at home will also save you $600 to $1,400 a year.<br/><strong>Clip Coupons.</strong> Go to your favorite brand's website for coupons and other special offers. Many moms also report buying coupons for less than face value on <a class=""vglnk"" href=""http://www.ebay.com/"" rel=""nofollow"" target=""_blank""><span>eBay</span></a>. And always check your Sunday circular for weekly sales.<strong>Formula</strong><strong></strong><br><strong>Try Powder.</strong> ""Powdered formula is the least expensive, while ready-to-eat is the priciest,"" says Fields.  Powdered formula costs on average 9 cents to 13 cents per ounce versus premixed formula at 20 cents per ounce, or about 50 percent more.</br><strong>Fill 'Er Up with Regular. </strong>Because ""special"" formulas for sensitive tummies can be costly, start out with a store-brand iron-fortified cow's milk-based formula. But if your baby shows any signs of sensitivity - rash or hives, vomiting, fussiness or crying after a feeding - check with your pediatrican about switching to a new formula.<br><strong>Get Freebies.</strong> Your doctor's office is a treasure trove of free formula samples. All you have to do is ask. And as with diapers, once you find a brand you like, check out its website for coupons and free diaper bags, or sign up for its frequent-buyers club.</br> "

And your time together,” and in the company’s <a href=""http://similac.com/app"">video preview of the app</a>, the following message appears: “New babies and a predictable schedule have never mixed. Until now.” Reality check, Similac: <em>babies are not predictable</em>. Also, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the World Health Organization, and La Leche League recommend nursing on demand, not on a schedule. An app that tries to force a schedule is bound to drive a new mom bonkers, and possibly sabotage her efforts at breastfeeding.<br><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-scheduling-babys-feedings?cid=plusblog"">Plus: Dr. Sears on Why Rigid Scheduling Doesn’t Work for Breastfed Babies</a></br>(For more info about why this app could disrupt nursing, check out this awesome analysis from <a href=""http://www.bestforbabes.org/2011/02/booby-apped/"">Best for Babes</a>.)Even more disturbing: if you’re having nursing problems (or if the app tells you you are), you are directed to Similac’s feeding hotline to talk to a live expert. Only the “expert” will not be a certified lactation consultant, since they are forbidden from working for formula companies. We have a feeling the “advice” you’d get would involve using formula. Asking a formula company for help with nursing is kind of like asking a junk food company for diet tips.There’s also another issue: Abbott Laboratories, maker of Similac, paid a number of mommy bloggers to review the app, via a third-party. The problem? It’s not clear on the reviews that the bloggers were ultimately paid by the maker of the app and the formula it promotes. Pharmalot, a pharmaceutical blog, recently <a href=""http://www.pharmalot.com/2011/02/abbott-pays-mommy-blogs-to-review-similac-app/"">examined this problem of lack of transparency</a>, as did <a href=""http://www.bnet.com/blog/drug-business/abbott-pays-bloggers-for-positive-reviews-of-its-similac-app/7496?tag=content;drawer-container"">CBS BNET</a> and <a href=""http://www.marketingmama.com/2011/02/from-diaper-bags-to-phone-apps.html"">Marketing Mama</a>, the latter of whom so aptly summed it up: “A formula company is not about supporting breastfeeding - period. Let's just get that straight. They are about selling formula.”Do you think a formula company has any business dispensing tools or advice that support breastfeeding, or are there always ulterior motives? "
 Your Breastfeeding Problems Solved!,http://www.parenting.com/article/your-breastfeeding-problems-solved,"<strong>Q. My baby is due in a month, and I'm very eager to breastfeed. However, my nipples are flat, which I've heard can make latch-on more difficult. Do you have any suggestions that will <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">help</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> my baby breastfeed successfully?</strong><strong>A.</strong> While protuberant nipples can make grasping the breast easier for a baby, an infant can certainly learn to nurse effectively from flat, and even inverted, nipples. Try the following latch-on technique for nursing using the traditional cradle hold: Support your baby using your arm on the same side you will be breastfeeding. Her head should be resting in the crook of your elbow or on your forearm. Rotate your arm to turn your baby's whole body toward you, so the two of you are chest-to-chest. During the learning period, it is important that you support your breast using your opposite hand to help your baby stay well attached. Cup your four fingers under your breast, placing your index finger and thumb parallel to your baby's jaws and well behind the margin of your areola, the dark circular area surrounding your nipple. Your baby needs to grasp the entire nipple, plus at least one inch of surrounding areola and breast so her jaws are situated over your milk ducts.With your baby turned toward you, lightly stroke the midpoint of her lips against your nipple until she opens her mouth widely, as if yawning, and then quickly pull her onto your breast. When she is latched on correctly, her mouth will be wide open with her lips flared out (a bit like a fish), her nose resting against your upper breast, and her chin against the underside of your breast. She will not grasp sufficient breast tissue if you try to push your nipple into her mouth or attempt to attach her when her mouth is only slightly open.Some health-care providers recommend the use of breast shells, also known as milk cups, for women with flat or inverted nipples. These hard, plastic, dome-shaped devices can help make the nipple more protuberant by directing it forward through a central opening in the shell. This opening is situated over your nipple, and the device is held in place by a maternity bra during the last month or two of pregnancy. (Breast shells can also be worn between feedings after the baby is born.) Another strategy for making a flat or inverted nipple easier to grasp is to use a breast pump to draw it out before you feed your infant.Don't be afraid to ask for help if you're having difficulty. Ideally, your first breastfeeding session will occur within 30 to 60 minutes after giving birth, when your baby's sucking instinct is most intense and help from a knowledgeable lactation consultant or nurse is readily available.<em>Contributing editor Marianne Neifert, M.D., is co-founder and medical consultant to the HealthOne Lactation Program in Denver, Colorado, and author of</em> Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding.<strong>Q. I developed painful cracks on both nipples three days after delivery. Now, a week later, nursing is still so uncomfortable that I actually dread it. My friends tell me to tough it out, but if the pain continues much longer, I'll quit. Am I doing something wrong?</strong><strong>A.</strong> Most women experience mild, temporary discomfort for the first few days of breastfeeeding, but the painful, cracked nipples you describe at ten days postpartum are not a normal part of nursing. If your baby's doctor or your own is not comfortable examining your nipples and assessing your breastfeeding technique, ask to be referred to a lactation consultant. Even if you have to pay for this service, this is money well spent.Although the major cause of severe or chronic sore nipples is trauma from incorrect latch-on and sucking, other factors can play a part in exacerbating the problem. For example, inappropriate nipple care -- such as overdrying or excessive moisture¿ -- can delay healing. Furthermore, nipple cracks and wounds are easily infected by bacteria or yeast present in the baby's mouth. So first make sure your baby is latched on correctly, then take care of your nipples. Try applying medical grade ultrapure lanolin after feedings or wearing new moisture-retaining, hydrogel dressings between feedings for a soothing skin barrier. In addition, your doctor can prescribe an antibiotic or an antifungal medication if an infection is present.To continue nursing more comfortably while your nipples heal, begin breastfeeding on the least sore side to trigger your milk-ejection reflex. Once milk flow has begun, the baby should suck less vigorously when brought to the second, more irritated breast. Frequent, short feedings are preferable, since delaying the interval between feedings results in greater breast engorgement and a ravenously hungry baby -- a combination that can cause further trauma during nursing.If your nipple pain is so severe that you must interrupt breastfeeding, you can temporarily express your breastmilk using a fully automatic, electric breast pump, which usually is more comfortable than your sucking baby. Use the pump at regular feeding times, and feed the expressed milk to your infant until your nipples have healed.<strong>Q. While breastfeeding my 2-month-old baby, I experienced several painful plugged ducts -- twice on one breast and once on the other. Is there anything I can do to avoid a recurrence?</strong><strong>A.</strong> A plugged duct, also known as a blocked duct or a caked breast, results when one of the milk ducts draining the lobes of the breast becomes partially obstructed. It creates a firm, tender, engorged area of the breast, and often an elongated lump can be felt. Since milk glands are concentrated in the outer areas of the breast, blocked ducts are common near the armpits. If not quickly remedied, a blocked duct can progress to a breast infection known as mastitis (discussed below), which should be suspected whever redness is present.A blocked duct usually occurs when you haven't breastfed your baby often or long enough. Women who produce abundant milk are particularly prone to this problem, and being separated from your infant or going a long time without nursing is another common risk factor. In addition, constrictive clothing, such as a tight underwire bra or straps from a baby carrier that are pulled too tight, can interfere with milk flow.The most effective way to relieve a blocked duct is to nurse your baby as much as possible. Starting several consecutive feedings on the affected side will help, since babies nurse more vigorously and take more milk from the first breast. You can also place your baby so that her chin points toward the plugged duct, a position that will help promote drainage. Warm compresses or a warm shower can trigger your let-down reflex and improve milk flow, and gentle massage of the blocked area is often effective in relieving the obstruction. Be careful not to press too firmly, however, as causing trauma to your breast increases the risk of mastitis. If, for some reason, your breast isn't well drained after nursing, use a breast pump to remove extra milk.Recurrent clogged ducts can be a sign of breast inflammation or low-grade infection; treatment with antibiotics sometimes curbs the problem. Occasionally, a breast lump is mistaken for a clogged duct. Any lump which persists for more than several days should be checked by a doctor.<strong>Q. I returned to work full-time when my baby was 12 weeks old. I continue to breastfeed when I'm with my baby, and I pump at the office. Since I have been back, however, I have had two bouts of mastitis, both in the same breast. What causes mastitis, and what can I do to avoid it?</strong><strong>A.</strong> Mastitis, or a breast infection, occurs in at least two percent of breastfeeding women. Flu-like symptoms are typical -- fever, chills, headache, body aches, and fatigue -- along with an area of the breast that is tender, red, and firm. Mastitis is often preceded by a clogged duct, an infected cracked nipple, irregular or ineffective milk removal, or simple exhaustion. Working mothers often develop mastitis when they are unable to express their milk at regular intervals and become sleep-deprived and physically depleted.Mastitis should be promptly treated with appropriate antibiotics for 10 to 14 days. If infection occurs while you are breastfeeding a healthy baby, you should continue nursing. If you don't, your milk production will likely decrease, making breastfeeding more difficult after the infection has cleared. Nurse your baby on the unaffected breast first, and move him to the painful breast only once the let-down reflex has been triggered. Ibuprofen can help reduce inflammation and pain, and ice or warm packs can provide comfort. If direct breastfeeding is too painful or milk flow is impaired, you should express your milk.Recurrences often happen when an ineffective antibiotic is prescribed or when the course of treatment is too short. The best way to avoid another bout of mastitis: Pump on a regular schedule while you are at work (at least every four hours), and nurse your baby often when the two of you are together. To reduce your level of fatigue, curtail any unnecessary activities, enlist help with household chores, try to get extra sleep, drink plenty of fluids, and eat regular meals.<strong>Q. My first baby was formula-fed, but my doctor is urging me to breastfeed my second baby, who's due in three months. I'm used to seeing how much milk a baby takes from a bottle, and I'm concerned that I won't know if my newborn is satisfied with breastfeeding. How will I be able to tell?</strong><strong>A.</strong> Even though your breasts don't have calibrations, a number of indicators can help reassure you about your baby's milk intake. The most reliable is your baby's weight. Although your newborn will lose a little weight at first, once abundant milk production begins about the third day postpartum, he will start drinking greater quantities of milk and gain weight rapidly. He will likely surpass his birth weight by 10 to 14 days of age. On average, breastfed babies gain about an ounce each day, or nearly a pound every two weeks, for the first two to three months of life, after which their rate of weight gain tapers.Since ""what goes in must come out,"" you should also watch the contents of your baby's diaper. Well-fed newborn babies should have at least four sizable, yellow, seedy bowel movements each day. Infrequent or scant bowel movements, or failure to start passing yellow stools by the fourth day of life, indicate that a baby may not be getting enough milk. In addition to moving his bowels, a well-nourished, breastfed newborn can be expected to wet his diaper after each feeding. The urine should be clear, not dark.Your baby should nurse 8 to 12 times in a 24-hour period with 10 to 15 minutes of active suckling per breast at each feeding. A newborn who has obtained adequate milk will usually fall asleep contentedly after nursing, while an underfed infant may act fussy, suck on his hands, and frequently require a pacifier.<strong>Q. My baby was born a few weeks early and had a lot of trouble latching on to nurse during the first week. Now, at 3 weeks of age, she is still below her birth weight, and her doctor is insisting that I should start supplementing her with formula. I am hesitant to do so, however, as I am afraid that this will prevent her from ever breastfeeding successfully. Is there any other way to get breastfeeding on track after such a poor start?</strong><strong>A.</strong> In my opinion, your breastfeeding problems are not likely to self-correct with perseverance alone. Because of your baby's relatively small size, preterm birth, and poor nursing, I suspect that your milk supply has steadily decreased over the past three weeks. Your underweight baby cannot be expected to build it up on her own. I recommend you immediately focus on making sure your baby receives adequate nutrition and on increasing your milk production. Once these goals have been accomplished, you have a good chance of returning to full breastfeeding.First, breastfeed your baby approximately every 3 hours, for 5 to 10 minutes per breast. Then offer her as much formula as is necessary to satisfy her appetite. In addition, you should use a breast pump (preferably a fully automatic electric pump) for 10 to 15 minutes immediately after nursing your baby. The pump will remove any milk your baby was unable to take and provide an effective stimulus to maximize your milk production. The residual high-fat hindmilk you obtain with the pump can be used to supplement your baby at the next feeding. Your spouse or a friend can give your baby her supplemental milk while you use the pump so as to shorten this triple-feeding process.As your milk supply increases and your baby's nutritional status improves, she will obtain more milk by breastfeeding and require less supplemental formula. As you return to full breastfeeding, wean your child from formula before you end your pumping regimen.<strong>Q. I am breastfeeding my 6-week-old daughter, and my milk production seems out of control. I leak onto my bed at night and soak through my blouse during the day. My baby gulps and sputters her way through her feedings, and sometimes cries in frustration. What do you recommend?</strong><strong>A.</strong> I agree that an overabundant milk supply can be a mixed blessing. While it's nice to know that your baby is getting plenty of milk, leaking is inconvenient, overly full breasts are prone to mastitis, and your baby can feel like she is drinking from a fire hydrant.Try nursing your baby from one breast at each feeding. She should be better able to control the flow of milk as the initial spraying subsides. A few hours later, you can nurse her from the opposite side. (At first, it may be necessary to pump some of the excess milk from the unsuckled breast to prevent engorgement.) Your baby may also find it easier to nurse if you are leaning back in a recliner, so that the top of her head is slightly above the top of your breast.Fortunately, leaking tends to diminish after 6 to 8 weeks, when the capacity of your milk ducts increases to better contain the milk released during let-down. I predict your supply will gradually come to match your baby's demand as she gets bigger. Meanwhile, wear breast pads to help deal with the hassles of leaking.<strong>Q. I had breast-reduction surgery a few years before I got pregnant, and I was advised that the procedure could interfere with breastfeeding. Is this true?</strong><strong>A.</strong> Although little scientific research is available on this topic, practitioners who work with nursing mothers agree that breast-reduction surgery poses a risk to successful breastfeeding. While it is remotely possible that you will be able to provide all the milk your baby requires, it is more likely that your infant will need to drink some supplemental formula in addition to the milk he obtains from you.Although many techniques can be used to perform a breast reduction, the procedure usually requires a surgical incision around the areola, which can cut milk ducts. Disruption of these ducts will partially prevent milk from flowing to the nipple openings.Although you can still breastfeed your baby, your infant's weight will need to be closely monitored after birth. Your baby's doctor or a lactation consultant can determine how much milk he takes from each breast at a typical feeding by weighing your baby in the same clothes before and after breastfeeding. I also encourage you to use a breast pump after most feedings for at least the first week of your baby's life to help maximize your milk production.Even if you need to supplement with formula, your baby will enjoy the pleasures of ""comfort nursing."" Your breasts represent far more than nutrition to your infant. Breastfeeding provides security, physical intimacy, and skin-to-skin contact -- it certainly doesn't have to be exclusive to be of significant value to you and your baby.<strong>Q. I am struggling with postpartum depression, and my doctor thinks medication would help. Can these types of drugs harm my breastfeeding baby?</strong><strong>A.</strong> You are certainly not alone in your struggles with depression; it's the most common psychiatric illness in new mothers. I believe that you will be a happier, more effective mother if you receive treatment. Your baby is likely to benefit as well, since depressed mothers are usually less able to meet their children's needs.While virtually all drugs taken by a nursing mother appear in her breastmilk to some degree, these minimal amounts usually pose no risk to a nursing infant. (Premature or sick newborns may be more vulnerable to the effects of drugs than older, healthier infants.) For this reason, very few medications are actually restricted for breastfeeding mothers. Those that are include cancer chemotherapy agents, drugs that suppress the immune system, and all illicit drugs.While little specific information is available about the safety of commonly prescribed antidepressants during breastfeeding, several studies show that a number of drugs have no adverse effects on nursing infants. Among the newer medications, Zoloft seems to be one of the safest, because very little drug enters the breastmilk, and none has been detected in breastfeeding babies whose mothers had taken the drug. Although many nursing mothers have taken Prozac, it has been found in some infants, and reports have suggested it may cause infant colic, sedation, or insomnia. Whatever medication your doctor prescribes, inquire about its safety during breastfeeding, inform your baby's pediatrician that you are taking the drug, and watch your infant closely for possible side effects.<strong>Q. I was hoping to breastfeed my baby for at least one year, but she is only 7 months old and is starting to refuse to nurse. She drinks bottles of my expressed milk (plus some formula) while I am at work, but when I try to nurse her at home in the evening, she pulls away and cries. I'm definitely not ready to wean, so what should I do?</strong><strong>A.</strong> It sounds like your baby is showing signs of a ""nursing strike,"" which is a sudden refusal to breastfeed. This problem is often seen in babies like yours who have been receiving bottles and may have developed a preference for the ease of bottlefeeding, although many babies have no problem with a breast/bottle combination.I find that a nursing strike is often related to a low milk supply. Since your baby is receiving formula while you are at work, I suspect that you are no longer pumping all the milk your baby needs. Because she gets milk easily from the bottle, your baby may find breastfeeding to be frustrating, especially in the evenings when your supply is typically lower.One of the best ways to get her breastfeeding again is to offer your breast while she is drowsy or asleep. Most babies will automatically breastfeed in their sleep, and many will continue to nurse without protest when they awaken. Never try to force your baby to latch on, however, as this may only increase her aversion to breastfeeding.In the evenings, try to offer your breast before your baby becomes frantically hungry. If she seems frustrated by the rate of milk flow, you may need to give her a little formula to take the edge off of her appetite before she can enjoy the comfort and security of nursing. Whenever she does not breastfeed well, use your breast pump to express your milk in order to keep your supply up."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Nighttime Bottles and Tooth Decay,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-nighttime-bottles-and-tooth-decay,"<b>Watering down.</b> To give your baby a sugar-free feeding at night, dilute the formula with water, increasing the amount of water to formula gradually, so that over a few months' time your baby will get used to going to bed with a bottle of water. Under the age of one year, however, this will be unrealistic since infants require a before-bed feeding to give them enough nourishment to last through the night. If you notice that he wakes up more often after you've diluted the formula, then you'll know he needs the full-strength formula to carry him through the night.<b>Give him a chaser.</b> After you've given him his usual bottle of formula, let him drift off to sleep with a bottle of water. Sucking on the bottle of water can help remove some of the formula that may still be present in his mouth.<b>Brush his teeth twice a day.</b> After his nighttime bottle, wrap a piece of wet gauze around your index finger. Using your finger as a tooth brush, wipe away the formula from his teeth. (Try to do this before he's completely asleep.) Be sure to brush his teeth as soon as he wakes up in the morning or after his first feeding. This will remove any formula that has stuck to the teeth during the night. For babies who absolutely must continue night feedings, a morning tooth brushing is a must.Tooth decay from nighttime bottles is seldom a problem under a year of age when baby only has a few teeth (approximately eight teeth appear between six and twelve months, four upper front teeth and four lower front teeth, which are the easiest to brush).Most of the tooth decay from night feedings  -- dubbed ""bottle mouth""  -- occurs in toddlers between one and two years of age who refuse to give up their nighttime bottle. It's also the age when you need to be extra vigilant about dental hygiene. By two years of age, your baby will have approximately 18 teeth and his full set of 24 teeth usually by two and a half years."
 Ask Dr. Mom: Constipation in Babies,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-mom-constipation-in-babies,"<strong>Q. My 8-month-old son often goes three or four days without a bowel movement, and when he tries to have one, he turns red and screams as if he's in pain. I breastfed him for 5 months before switching him to formula, and since then he's been eating cereal, fruits, and vegetables. Is his <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">diet</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> to blame?</strong><strong>A.</strong> Constipation is generally defined as the passage of infrequent (usually less than three per week), painful, and hard bowel movements. Although the condition is often self-correcting, it can become a recurrent problem if a child starts to withhold difficult stools. In fact, 25 percent of chronic childhood constipation begins in infancy, so it's important to recognize and treat the problem.The frequency, size, and consistency of stools passed at different ages varies widely. As a child grows, it takes longer for food to pass through the intestines. Between 1 and 10 weeks of age, it is normal for infants to grunt and strain to pass a soft bowel movement. Breastfed infants commonly have more frequent stools than formula-fed infants, but by 4 months of age, most babies average two bowel movements a day. Your son's pattern of passing infrequent stools with difficulty is typical of constipation.Constipation in infants and toddlers can be caused by inactivity, illness, medications, fever, dehydration, or most commonly, dietary changes. A change in diet is also the first-line remedy. For infants, add one to two teaspoons of Maltsupex (a malt extract from barley) to formula 2 to 3 times daily. If the infant is breastfed, add to expressed breast milk or water. Sometimes changing from a cow's-milk-based formula to a formula containing whey protein or to a soy formula also may help. (Talk to your pediatrician before switching.)For babies like yours who are already on solids, you can increase fiber-rich foods such as prunes, peas, plums, pears, peaches, beans, and whole-grain cereals. Avoid applesauce, bananas, and carrots, which can be binding. You can also offer a daily serving of fruit juice, such as grape, cherry, or prune. For babies over one year, avoid an excessive intake of dairy products.If dietary changes are not effective, your baby's doctor may prescribe a mild laxative or stool softener (such as milk of magnesia, sorbitol, or mineral oil). Never give your child a laxative, suppository, or enema without consulting his doctor.Rarely, constipation can be traced to physical problems, including abnormalities of the bowel or rectum or illnesses such as hypothyroidism. Parents should call their baby's doctor immediately, if the condition is severe and unresponsive to treatment, begins in the baby's first days of life, or is associated with vomiting, persistent distention of the abdomen, or poor growth."

 Myth Buster: Infant Feedings,http://www.parenting.com/article/myth-buster-infant-feedings," Adding some rice cereal to your baby's breast milk or formula will help her <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">sleep</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> through the night. A study at the Cleveland Clinic involving more than 100 babies found that adding a tablespoon of rice cereal per ounce of breast milk or formula in nighttime bottles had no effect on sleep. Plus, infants shouldn't be given solids before they're 4 to 6 months old, when their tongue movements develop enough for swallowing and they can sit up with little support, says Elisa Zied, spokes-person for the American Dietetic Association. (It's also better to introduce solids with a spoon to help develop eating skills.)Alas, middle-of-the-night feedings may be inevitable. Until about 4 to 6 months, most babies can't hold enough food in their stomachs to last until morning. Even after 6 months, they can wake naturally throughout the night, and it may take some time before they learn how to soothe themselves back to sleep without the comfort of a breast or bottle. "

 Feeding a Preemie,http://www.parenting.com/article/feeding-a-preemie,"If you've given birth prematurely, your breast milk is ideal for your baby's needs; it's rich in antibodies and certain nutrients.

Is this serious?</strong><strong></strong><br><strong>A.</strong> No. This is common and harmless -- and almost always due to a tiny tear in the rectum (called a rectal fissure), typically caused by constipation.</br>Nonetheless, you'll want to take some steps to help soften her stools, since rectal fissures can cause some discomfort and a very fussy baby.Constipation -- and rectal tearing -- almost always occur in formula-fed babies and those who are starting to eat solid foods. So if your baby's on formula, consult her pediatrician about changing to another type that may be more intestine-friendly or ask if, in addition to the formula, you can give her a couple of ounces of plain water. For babies over 6 months, add high-fiber fruits that contain a lot of water -- like prunes and plums -- to her diet. (Four ounces of prune juice diluted with four ounces of water is a good option as well.) Talk with your baby's doctor about cutting back a bit on cereal -- this may ease her constipation too.Meanwhile, to help her pass her stools painlessly, try smearing a bit of petroleum jelly on the outside of the anus once or twice a day. Within five to ten days, the tear should be healed.If, however, your baby sometimes goes through phases where she has infrequent bowel movements, it's not always a sign of constipation. Stool patterns can change regularly without it signaling a problem. Babies can go a few days without having a poopy diaper -- and those who are breastfed may go less frequently than formula-fed infants, since mother's milk is digested more fully and therefore produces little waste.When to see your pediatrician: if the pattern persists for many months or if your baby's stools are really hard (a sign that she's not getting enough water). He may prescribe a suppository or suggest additional testing."
 Kids Health QA: Baby Bellyaches,http://www.parenting.com/article/kids-health-qa-baby-bellyaches,"My 7-week old squirms and cries when she poops. What can I do?<b>Q. I breastfeed my 7-week-old, with occasional formula. She squirms and cries when she poops. I've tried everything. What else can I do?</b>Rest assured, this <em>will</em> go away, improving as her digestive system matures. Lots of babies squirm and fuss when they have a bowel movement, but I know it's hard to watch yours go through it. Sometimes babies who are mostly breastfed have gas and constipation with even just the occasional bottle of formula, so if it's not an important part of your routine, try nursing exclusively for a while. Otherwise, talk to your doctor about switching formulas.If neither option works, consider eliminating dairy from your diet. A cow's-milk allergy can cause symptoms like these in breastfed babies whose moms eat milk-based foods.In the meantime, holding her with her belly down may soothe the immediate discomfort (just don't let her sleep that way). Parents also sometimes ask me about simethicone drops, but I don't recommend them -- studies show they're no more effective than a placebo. If none of the other interventions helps, or if she develops hard stool, blood in her stool, vomiting, or fever, check in with your pediatrician."

What to watch for? Stools so loose they sink into the diaper, says Jolanda White, M.D., a pediatric gastroenterologist at Columbus Children's Hospital in Ohio. Here's the lowdown on what's up with all that doo-doo:<strong>When to call the doc:</strong> Anytime a baby younger than 2 months has diarrhea, when you see blood in the stools, or when the diarrhea lasts more than eight hours. Be on the lookout for dehydration; the first clue is fewer wet diapers. If you see a sunken soft spot, head for the E.R.<strong>How to treat it:</strong> Continue to nurse or give your baby an over-the-counter electrolyte solution (hold off on cow's-milk formula). For ongoing baby diarrhea from antibiotics, some doctors recommend a probiotic supplement.<strong>What to feed:</strong> When appetite returns, offer babies eating solids a binding BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast), yogurt that contains live cultures (such as Stonyfield Farms), and low-fat protein, like baked chicken."
 On Call: Gassy Baby,http://www.parenting.com/article/on-call-gassy-baby,"<strong>Q.</strong> <b>My 6-week-old burps and farts all the time  -- not only after she's just been <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">fed</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>. The gas even wakes her up from naps. Is this normal?</b><br><strong>A.</strong> It certainly can be. My 9-month-old used to let out burps that were so loud they made us jump! Usually, the gassiness subsides by the time a baby's a few months old.</br>Sometimes, though, breastfed babies are gassy because they're sensitive or allergic to foods in their mom's diet. If your baby's fussing a lot or not feeding well, you might want to eliminate foods one at a time for a few days to see if it helps. Start with dairy, the most likely culprit, then try citrus fruits and juices, nuts, cabbage, onions, and broccoli.Some babies have problems with the cow's milk in formula or the soy in soy formula. If yours is formula-fed, talk to the pediatrician about the best one for her.You should also call the doctor if gassiness continues past her first birthday or is accompanied by vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, bloody stools, or rash, since these can be symptoms of more serious intestinal problems.Most likely, though, you'll just have to wait for the gas to pass. Until then, burping your baby during and after feedings can reduce that air bubble in her tummy, and holding her so her belly is against you can soothe her if she seems uncomfortable."
 Beauty Basics: A Good Foundation,http://www.parenting.com/article/beauty-basics-a-good-foundation,"Today's foundations are natural looking, easy to use, and can erase problems like dry or oily skin and an uneven tone. They can also conceal blemishes and scars and give skin a smoother finish. New formulas with antioxidants, salicylic acid, and sun protection can help prevent future damage and keep skin in top form.There are formulas and colors to match every complexion. Keep these points in mind when shopping:<b>OILY SKIN</b>Look for liquid or powder foundations labeled oil control, oil free (like Bobbi Brown Essentials Oil-Free Foundation), or noncomedogenic (won't clog pores and cause breakouts). Long-lasting formulas can also control oil.<b>DRY SKIN</b>Creamier formulas  -- liquids or creams  -- packed with emollients like glycerine are best for rehydrating parched skin. One pick: L'Oreal Visible Lift Line Minimizing Makeup.<b>FULL</b>If you have discoloration or prefer a porcelain finish, a cream, liquid, or stick in medium to full coverage is for you. Good bets: Max Factor Pan-Stik Ultra-Creamy Makeup, or new Photochrome Compact Makeup from Prescriptives (color that adjusts to different types of light and a great compact make it worth the $35 expense).<b>SHEER</b>If you have relatively even tone and just want to add a subtle glow, try an ultra-sheer foundation like Revlon New Complexion Even Out Makeup SPF 20.<b>SPOT</b>Look natural and cover trouble areas: Apply foundation only where you need it (medium- to full-coverage creams or sticks work best for this), blend edges well with your fingertip or a sponge, and lightly dust face with powder to set.<b>TRY BEFORE YOU BUY</b>The advantage of pricier department store brands is that you can try them on in the store first. If you buy at a drug or discount store and the color or formula isn't right for you, you may be able to take it back. Find out the store's return policy for cosmetics before you buy to avoid costly mistakes.<b>PERFECT PICKS</b>For the best match, blend a small amount of foundation onto your cheek  -- not on your neck or hand. The right color will ""disappear"" into your skin, says New York-based creator of the Bobbi Brown Essentials makeup line and mother of three, Bobbi Brown."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Feeding Battles,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-feeding-battles,"<strong>Q. I just learned that when my mother babysits my 4-month-old, she gives her a bottle of water after she is finished with her regular bottle. I'm upset that she's taken it upon herself to do this without consulting me first, and I'm also concerned because I've heard that water isn't necessary or even good for <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">babies</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>. How can I explain this to my mom without offending her?<br><br>A. </br></br></strong>Throughout my career as a pediatrician, I have learned to greatly respect grandmothers. They usually make the best babysitters, because that blood relationship gives them an advantage in all aspects of caregiving. My wife and I have eight grandchildren ourselves, and it is such a privilege for us to take care of them. While you are very fortunate to have your child's grandmother as a babysitter, you are still your baby's mother, and you are the one to call the shots on what you believe is best for her. Here's how to gently guide your mom into your way of thinking:<strong>Blame it on the doctor.</strong> A tip I give my patients when they are divided with family members on a sensitive health issue and want to take the heat off of themselves is to simply say that ""the doctor said so."" Many people of your mother's generation grew up in an era when it was the norm to follow medical advice without question, so it's likely she'll respect the doctor's final word.<strong>Choose your battles wisely.</strong> Differences in childcare beliefs can be notorious for causing friction among family members, and the last thing you want to do is alienate your mother. I suggest you focus on the bigger issues, and ignore the smaller ones. In my opinion, your mom giving your baby a bottle of water after a feeding is a small issue  -- as long as it doesn't lessen the amount of necessary formula or expressed breast milk that your baby takes and she's gaining weight properly, then you don't need to worry about it. A formula-fed baby needs approximately 2- to-2.5 ounces of formula per pound of weight each day. You might be reassured to know that if your baby is on formula, a bit of extra water is probably good for her. Since formula can be more concentrated than breast milk, we often advise that formula-fed babies get an extra four to eight ounces of water daily to help the developing kidneys function and properly process the formula. That said, if your baby is drinking expressed breast milk from her bottle, extra water is not necessary.You can also compromise by asking your mom to give her just an ounce or so of water after her regular bottle. Finally, trust your baby's own instincts  -- she's not going to eat more than she needs to. If you look into it, you'll probably realize that she's taking only a small amount of water after the bottle.<strong>Focus on the social interaction.</strong> Occasionally, watch your mother when she gives your baby a bottle. It's likely to be a high-touch social interaction between the two of them, not just a routine delivery of milk. The extra cuddle time that your baby gets from her grandma during feedings is probably worth overlooking any feeding liberties your mom may take."
 Guest Blog: Why Latch On NYC is Not the Answer to Low Breastfeeding Rates,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/denene-millner-mybrownbaby/guest-blog-why-latch-nyc-not-answer-low-breastfeeding,"One might think that based on my breastfeeding experience after the birth of my first <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">child</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> and my staunchly pro-breastfeeding stance—I breastfed my two daughters for a year each—that I’d be all for Latch On NYC. Quite the contrary, I’m not. <em>We asked author and long-time </em>Parenting<em> contributor Denene Millner of <a href=""http://mybrownbaby.com/"" target=""_blank"">My Brown Baby</a> to weigh in on the new Latch On NYC program. Read content director Ana Connery’s <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/cause-i-said-so/boob-patrol"" target=""_blank"">opposing take</a> here.</em>First off, let me tell you this: despite that I had every intention of breastfeeding my first child, the hospital where I gave birth—specifically, its nurses—did absolutely nothing to help a sistah get the job done. Maybe they were too busy to be bothered. Or perhaps they thought a lactation consultant would magically find her way to my room to help me figure it all out. Personally, I think they took one look at me and made the calculations: young, black, poor, single, ignorant, formula.Nobody expects black mothers to breastfeed. Indeed, let the statistics tell it and only about half of us actually breastfeed for any period of time in our children’s young lives. Cue the formula swag bags.Thank sweet baby Jesus my little darling wasn’t aware of the stats—couldn’t see the judgmental glares that pierced like daggers when the nurses bothered to check up on us, or hear the loud thud when one dropped a bag with two industrial-sized bottles of Similac or Enfamil or whatever it was on the floor next to my bed. My baby was too busy trying to get herself some ninny to care.But I cared. I cared that the assumptions were made, and that nurses had no faith in my desire to do what I thought best for my child and that none, save for one, thought me and my baby important enough for proper breastfeeding instruction, even though I was clearly scared, overwhelmed, exhausted, clueless and making so many mistakes in the first feedings that my nipples were nearly shredded.This. This is what I remembered when I first read about <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/sasha-parentingcom/nyc-mayors-new-pro-breastfeeding-program-causes-controversy"" target=""_blank"">New York City Mayor Bloomberg’s new breastfeeding initiative, Latch On NYC</a>, what is being billed as the most restrictive pro-breastmilk program in the nation. Under the program, hospitals will keep and track bottles of formula in out-of-the-way secure storerooms or locked boxes, to be taken out only if it’s deemed medically necessary to feed it to a baby or a mother requests it. Under the program, mothers who receive formula will hear all about the health benefits of breast milk and told why it’s best to offer the breast to her baby instead of artificial milk.One might think that based on my breastfeeding experience after the birth of my first child and my staunchly pro-breastfeeding stance—I breastfed my two daughters for a year each—that I’d be all for Latch On NYC. Quite the contrary, I’m not. Because just as much as I don’t think the nurses I faced had the right to ignore my desire to breastfeed my child, I don’t think Mayor Bloomberg, hospitals or the nurses who work there have the right to assume that a mother is too dumb to have weighed her baby’s feeding options before she hit the maternity ward or that she needs a good talking-to if she asks for a bottle of formula for her baby.I’m a firm believer that mothers must have the right to choose their baby’s food on their own accord, sans judgment, even if their choice doesn’t necessarily jibe with the next woman’s choice. Treating formula like it’s some kind of nutrient-packed rat poison that needs to be under lock and key and dealt with like contraband does quick work of eroding a mother’s confidence and making her feel every bit as crappy about her choice to formula feed as I did while facing off against nurses, friends and family members who thought my choice to breastfeed was disgusting and dumb. In each instance, a mother’s right to have her choice respected is taken away by others who think it’s their mission to coerce, badger and guilt moms into feeding babies the way others see fit.The key word here is choice. No mother, in the middle of all the confusion and emotions and elation and crazy of bringing a new life into the world, needs nurses standing over her, treating her like she’s a total failure because she chose to formula feed, no matter what her reasoning is. Think it doesn’t happen? Consider what a friend of mine, who is black, wrote on the <a class=""vglnk"" href=""http://MyBrownBaby.com"" rel=""nofollow""><span>MyBrownBaby</span><span>.</span><span>com</span></a> Facebook page when I gave <a href=""http://mybrownbaby.com/2012/07/mayor-bloomberg-orders-hospitals-to-hide-formula-so-more-moms-will-breastfeed/"" target=""_blank"">my opinions</a> about Latch On NYC earlier this week:<em>“Due to a medically necessary breast reduction four years prior to giving birth, and my daughter's inability to suckle due to neurological developmental issues, my attempts at what was supposed to be a beautiful bonding moment turned into screams of a hungry baby, and tears of ‘failing’ mother. For the four days we spent in the hospital I was grudgingly ‘massaged’ (or violated depending on how you look at it), told I wasn't trying hard enough, told to relax, and handed pamphlet after pamphlet on the benefits of breast milk over formula—as if I hadn't already done the research. When they realized that Emory wasn't getting enough from my breasts during each feeding (yes, I tried and tried and tried and cried and cried and cried), the mini 2oz bottles were set on the table next to me in silence, and I watched as the lactation specialist just walked away.<br><br> I felt judged. I felt like a horrible mother. I.felt.like.a.FAILURE. So I tried again when we got home. I decided enough was enough when one day I was attempting to breastfeed my very hungry daughter and she couldn't latch on consistently, and I couldn't provide enough milk for her. She looked at me and screamed bloody murder. And I burst into tears. And that was the last day I attempted breastfeeding. My breasts were standing in the way of my bond, and that, not formula, was unacceptable.”</br></br></em>Mark my words: this will happen again and again. The assumptions and the judging will be particularly distinct for African-American moms because the assumption already is that we're uneducated and disinterested and need to be treated like children completely incapable of making decisions for our children. Think that’s not real? <a href=""http://mybrownbaby.com/2011/12/going-it-alone-survey-says-black-mothers-get-little-help-services-support-while-giving-birth/"">Read this</a>. Of course, I’m sure diehard breastfeeding advocates might take away my pro-breastfeeding card for my stance, but I honestly look at a woman’s choice to breastfeed much in the same way I do a woman’s right to abortion: I am anti-abortion for myself, but do not think it is my business, my right or my duty to tell another woman when and how she should become a mom. Just as I made the choice not to abort my pregnancies and to breastfeed my babies, the next woman has the right to choose to have an abortion if she’s not ready to be a mom and, when she has a baby, to buy formula by the truckload to feed to her child if she wants to.Thank God I stood my ground and breastfed my babies. Formula-feeding mothers have that right, too.  "

 Would You Feed Another Woman’s Breast Milk to Your Baby? (I am!),http://www.parenting.com/blogs/parenting-post/taylor-newman/would-you-feed-another-woman-s-breast-milk-your-baby-i-am,"I'd caught wind of the heated <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Pregnancy/Care/The-New-Breastfeeding-Rules"" target=""_blank"">breast milk debate/divide</a> (who could miss it?) before becoming pregnant; I knew about the benefits of <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/gallery/Baby/Real-Mom-Breastfeeding-Stories"" target=""_blank"">breastfeeding and breast milk</a>, and also about the countless healthy, happy formula-fed babies out there in the world, enjoying life. I was formula fed myself, and haven’t suffered from any IQ or immune system deficits, so while I appreciated from the get-go all that breastfeeding has to offer, I didn’t get swept up in the politics of it. I felt in the beginning of pregnancy, in that early stage of constant nausea and soul-crushing fatigue, that nine months was a long time for one’s body to host another being, and thus found myself leaning toward formula feeding in the interest of regaining a level of physical autonomy as soon as possible. Once into the second trimester, however, bumping along nicely and adjusted to the idea that my autonomy—physical or otherwise—was long gone (forever), and feeling okay about that, I decided <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Pregnancy/Feeding/Tips-for-Breastfeeding-Success"" target=""_blank"">I’d give breastfeeding a whirl</a>. We got Kaspar right on the boob once he was born, and he went right for it. We were on a roll.I didn’t breast feed exclusively. My supply wasn’t sufficient for that, despite doing serious time on the pump to keep things flowing. We figured out our rhythm and cut a 50/50 formula/mom-milk deal for Kaspar’s first three months of life. I really loved our evening <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/pregnancy/gallery/10-best-feeding-picks"" target=""_blank"">feeding</a>. Aaron and I would climb into bed with Kaspar, read or watch a movie quietly, and Kaspar would nurse himself to sleep. It was cozy. I’d be back at the pump a few hours later, though, to keep the milk on tap, and then feeding again soon after that; it was exhausting, but worth it. I’ve heard women talk about the sheer joy of breastfeeding. I never really felt that. I actually felt kind of chained to the couch while nursing, and chained to the kitchen table—without even the free use of my hands—while pumping. But again, it was a labor of love, and I rocked it.Once my maternity leave ended, however, I just couldn’t hack it. I pumped in the closet-sized phone-booth room (many times having to wait for someone to get off the phone before I could do my thing) that was reserved for an entire four companies’ worth of employees to use for the purpose (well, for two purposes... phone calls and breast-pumping) —appreciating meanwhile that the room existed at all—for a total of two weeks after returning to work, and then threw in the towel. I just knew, one night while pumping, that I was done, and it was a relief. I felt like three months was a respectable stretch, and that I was glad Kaspar’d gotten started on the liquid gold, but that organic formula was a beautiful thing. And that was that (do note, readers, that quitting breastfeeding cold turkey is a very bad idea… for your boobs, I mean… youch). I firmly decided that I wouldn’t look back, and wouldn’t take on any guilt about feeding Kaspar formula. He’s seven months old now, super healthy. All systems go.There’s been an interesting little twist of events in our story, recently. I have a standing weekly play date with a good mama-friend and her eighteen-month-old son. We’re the same age, embrace the same general parenting style, have similar senses of humor— you get the idea (a good friend). She’s breast fed her son exclusively, though, is still nursing, and offered to pump for Kaspar. I was floored. Pumping was a serious drag for me. I’d sit with that thing for forty-five minutes and get three ounces if I was lucky, but my friend here can pump that same amount in five minutes flat. Still, I was stunned by the offer. “You’d pump for him?” I asked in disbelief, to which she confirmed “I’d be happy to.”So, Kaspar’s getting breast milk and formula again, and to be honest it makes me feel good—really good—to know he’s benefiting from all of the healthy stuff breast milk has to offer (especially because he has eczema, and I suspect the breast milk gives his system a little extra skin-balancing boost). The ratio’s not 50/50 (Kaspar eats a lot), but that doesn’t matter to me. Austin’s a super pro-breastfeeding town (it’s done collectively in public places to drive the point home), and there’s a milk bank here, but it costs hundreds of dollars a week to get milk from the bank, and that’s just not in the cards for us right now. I’m feeling lucky for our inside supply.This same friend told me, too, about <a href=""http://milkshare.birthingforlife.com/"" target=""_blank"" title=""milk share"">Milk Share</a>. She knows of one family that adopted their daughter from India, and, thanks to the generosity of milk-solvent mamas, has never given their baby formula—it’s been all breast milk, all the way, for them. The milk share is not a milk bank— it’s like a list serve for parents to contact each other, and arrange for their own sharing situation. Screening is not included. I’ve registered on the share but not yet posted; I’m somewhat on the fence about whether to do so. On the one hand, I feel lucky to have the breast milk we have from a good friend who I know , and am a little wary of the off-chance that another donating mama might have some weird disease or whatever (highly unlikely, but still). On the other hand, I could certainly request milk only from moms who also donate to the bank (where they undergo stringent screening),  and potentially get Kaspar’s breast milk-to-formula ratio way up, or even get him drinking breast milk exclusively through the next few months.I think I’m going to stick with our current situation: feeding Kaspar formula, some of our friend’s milk, and solids (which he’s started, and enjoys). But I’m curious— what would you do? Go for it? Does the idea of <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Baby/Feeding/Breastfeeding-Controversy-Milk-Sharing/1"" target=""_blank"">sharing breast milk</a> gross you out, or do you think it’s the best idea ever? Have you donated your milk, used a share, or something similar to this? Looking forward to your thoughts. "
 Loving Spoonfuls,http://www.parenting.com/article/loving-spoonfuls,"Giving your baby ""real"" food is a parenting rite of passage. When to start, what to serve, and how often -- it seems so complicated after months of no-brainer breast milk or formula. But it doesn't have to be.<i>Christina Frank, a mom of two, writes on health and psychology for many magazines.</i>Before you even offer that first spoonful, you need to determine whether your baby is actually ready, a milestone that's usually reached between 4 and 6 months. Besides having good head control and being close to sitting on his own, there are three signs that a baby's ready for solid food: ""He'll be easy to distract while nursing or taking a bottle. He'll consistently wake up hungry at night for a few weeks. And he'll become upset that he can't have what you're eating,"" says Will Wilkoff, M.D., a pediatrician in Brunswick, Maine, and author of <em>Coping With a Picky Eater</em><em>That's what happened with my friend Kristin's otherwise placid 6-month-old, Leo. ""One day he lunged at my chocolate croissant and actually yanked off a piece,"" she says. ""He also eyed everything I put in my mouth."" Although rice cereal probably wasn't what he had in mind, Leo dutifully began with that. </em><em><b>* Getting started.</b> Mix the cereal (choose one that's fortified with iron, a necessary nutrient at this age) to a very watery consistency with breast milk, formula, or water. Then put a little on the tip of a spoon and slip it into your baby's mouth. Eating from a spoon requires a different set of skills than sucking from a breast or bottle, so don't give up -- it may take several tries before he gets the hang of it. </em><em>Continue to offer about a tablespoon of cereal once a day for a few days, thickening the consistency as the days pass. Feed him in the morning or evening, whenever it seems to be the best time for you both. </em><em>Don't fret about how much he actually swallows; at this age, infants still get most of their calories from breast milk or formula. ""The value of solids now is to teach your baby a new way to eat and expose him to new tastes and textures,"" says Connie Stuart, a clinical nutrition specialist at Johns Hopkins Children's Center, in Baltimore, and a mom of two. </em><em><b>* Bring on variety.</b> When you introduce pureed fruits and vegetables depends on your baby's age: If you started giving cereal at 4 months, wait a month or so; if you started at 6 months, add them to your baby's diet after a couple of weeks. Start with one at a time for four straight days before offering a new one. (This way, if there's an allergic reaction, you'll be able to identify the culprit.) </em><em>While some experts believe that it's important to begin with green vegetables so that your baby's taste buds aren't ""spoiled"" by the sugary taste of fruits and squashes, others dismiss this as myth, believing that infants are born with a sweet tooth. Most likely, your little one will eat what he wants no matter how deliberate you are. Olivia refused to look at a vegetable (and, at 6, still won't unless we agree to play a complicated game of farmer and cow -- don't ask). After tossing several jars of pricey organic baby-food peas, we were thrilled to see her wolf down applesauce. </em><em><b>* Aim for a routine.</b> Work toward serving three meals -- roughly breakfast, lunch, and dinner -- with three different food groups at each meal: cereal, vegetable, and fruit (while still nursing and/or bottle-feeding three to six times a day). But how much your baby eats should be up to him. He'll give you clear signs when he's had enough, like sticking out his tongue or turning his head away. </em><em>Just don't lose faith if your little one rejects a certain food the first few times. Offer it again a couple of days later. ""It may take as many as twenty tries before a baby begins to like a certain food,"" says Dr. Wilkoff. </em>Many baby-food manufacturers market a special line of meals with lumpier textures for the ""advanced"" eater. You can also mash your own foods -- just make sure nothing is bigger than a pea and that the food is able to dissolve in your baby's mouth within seconds. Some good choices: mashed potatoes, overcooked pieces of pasta, bits of banana, grated fruit or cheese, and, of course, Cheerios.Now's also the time to introduce meats -- chicken, turkey, pork, and beef -- either pureed or with a sloppy-Joe-like texture. (Continue to wait four days after introducing a new food before trying another one.) Certain types of fish, such as trout, are okay too; just be hypervigilant about tiny bones. Stay away from fish like swordfish and tilefish, which contain high levels of mercury.<b>* The appeal of finger-friendly foods.</b>Easier said than done, of course, when you're trying to chisel three-day-old Cream of Wheat off the toaster oven. Aside from feeding your child in the bathtub (don't laugh -- it's been done), Jeanne Donovan, a mom of three in Leawood, Kansas, suggests putting food directly on the high-chair tray and keeping bowls out of a baby's hands. ""My kids seemed to think that a bowl of food was best for throwing on the floor or using as a hat,"" she says. ""When you spread the food out on the tray, they can't get a critical mass going as easily.""Ellen De Money of Boulder, Colorado, recommends getting a dog. ""Our Lab manages to clean under the high chair, table legs, even between seat cushions!""[B {* The hazards of biscuits. While many parents like to give their infants things like teething biscuits, bagels, or breadsticks at this age, they're probably better for babies who have demonstrated good biting, chewing, and swallowing skills (which generally means those who are at least 12 months old). If you want to try a bagel or biscuit, make sure your child is sitting up while eating and that you or another adult is watching her -- these can be choking hazards, especially for babies who simply gnaw at them. (True for older babies too.) Saliva softens the bread, which can result in a piece breaking off.Grown-Up FoodBLUE_TEXT_BOLD(13 to 18 months)By this age, your baby should, if possible, be eating the same things as the rest of the family (cut up to manageable size) so he learns that mealtime is a sociable event and that certain rules apply -- though don't expect anything resembling table manners just yet.<b>* Balancing solids and liquids.</b> Solids are now the key source of your baby's nutrition, especially since he's probably drinking cow's milk, which contains a combination of nutrients different from breast milk or formula. Still, he should consume no more than 12 to 16 ounces of milk per day (or 2 cups' worth) so that he actually has an appetite for his meals. And because juice will also fill up a baby and provides almost no nutrition, serve him no more than 4 ounces a day.<b>* When to snack.</b> While some experts feel that it doesn't matter whether a child grazes all day or just eats three square meals, Dr. Wilkoff warns against ""oversnacking,"" where kids are allowed to munch endlessly and then have no real appetite at mealtimes.""Snacks should be given at two predictable times during the day -- say, after naptime and before a favorite video,"" he says. Aim for what's nutritious: fruit, string cheese, small cups of yogurt, or crackers.<b>* Adding on utensils.</b> Your toddler will no doubt want to try to feed himself. Choose a small, soft-edged spoon or a blunt fork, but if he's more interested in using it as a toy, weapon, or launching device than as a feeding tool, take it away and try again in a few weeks. Otherwise, he may be so distracted that he won't eat much.<b>* Why tots turn choosy.</b> As children become increasingly familiar with various foods and their growth rate slows down, picky eating can begin to rear its ugly head. Witness the parent of a finicky toddler and you may see someone teetering on the brink of insanity.My cousin David would painstakingly insert vegetables into his daughter Diana's penne pasta, only to watch her immediately poke them out. My friend Kristin spoon-fed her older son, Cole, until he was 4. And my husband and I have been literally moved to tears when Olivia has grudgingly agreed to eat a cherry tomato.The upshot? Don't go there, or you may never come back. Your job is to provide well-balanced, regular meals; your child's job is to eat them, or not. Forget tactics like bribery, and, whatever else you do, don't fall into the habit of preparing separate meals for your toddler.The best way to keep your sanity is to remember that kids eat in spurts and slowdowns. They won't starve themselves -- even though there'll be days when you swear your child is eating nothing but air."
" Oh there you are again, MAN COLD",http://www.parenting.com/blogs/parenting-post/maggie-cheung/oh-there-you-are-again-man-cold,"So you guys, Phillip was away for two weeks. Sure, he came home on the weekend, but let's face it, that doesn't count. TWO WEEKS. In that time I was 1) <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">pregnant</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> 2) answering the beck and call of two small people 3) packing up half my house for our impending move 4) fielding phone calls from real estate agents wanting to bring clients to see my rental house and 5) SICK. Every night I threw myself into bed as soon as I was sure the kids were asleep, a box of Kleenex perched on Phillip's pillow. Fun times! Then Phillip came home. I was still sick. Perhaps I was a tiny bit MORE sick, perhaps because I could finally just BE sick instead of doing everything else. I napped, I drank my orange juice, and by Easter Sunday I was feeling a smidge better. I was looking forward to seeing family and having my OWN family all together. But guess who got sick then? Oh yes. And not just sick. Sick with a MAN COLD. ""My throat is feeling kinda funny,"" Phillip informed me. ""Gee, I hope I'm not getting sick!""Except every wife knows what that means. Every wife steels herself against those words, doing her very best to hide the eye roll and swallow the groan. It's not that we're unsympathetic slavedrivers, it's not that we don't BELIEVE our husbands, it just means we'll be dealing with everything else plus A Man Cold, and honestly? We don't have time for that. Phillip did his spousely duty and spent Easter brunch chatting with my ginormous family, but when everyone had left and it was time to put the two-year-old down for her nap, he napped too. Later when I went to check on them, both Phillip and Molly were curled up in the twin bed, snoring. At that point it was fine. ""Cute!"" I thought. But then he woke up. And he had a headache. And chills. And probably a fever. My six-foot-two husband was curled in the fetal position on the guest bed, shivering under one of my mother's throw blankets. ""I'll be fine,"" he assured me, his voice weak and frail. Because 1) he really was sick and 2) we've had more than a few arguments on the subject, I think I did a fairly good job of poor babying my husband. After all, I hadn't seen him in two weeks. However. HOWEVER. It did cross my mind once or twice that at no point in the past two weeks, when I had ALSO been sick, did I get to lie down and shiver and be babied. And MAYBE I might have stood over his sickbed, my hand on his clammy forehead thinking, ""Well, so much for MY runny nose.""It's not that we don't think you're faking it, Husbands, or that we're unfeeling hags. It's just that we're probably not feeling so hot either, but we manage to get the kids breakfast anyway. AHEM. ... I only got to complain about The Man Cold on the condition that Phillip had an opportunity to defend himself in print. (And OMG he has been sitting right next to me this whole time doing Man Cold RESEARCH. GAH!)<em>So lest I box myself into a giant internet corner, I'm going to do my best to describe the vicious epidemic of the man cold.  Your average man is like a formula 1 race car.  We run 110% at top speeds (except for sitting on the couch.  That's like a pit stop.) When a cold hits us it's like turning that well oiled formula 1 race car into an old Geo Metro.  This is soooooo devastating to the male psyche that all we can do is sit on the couch and shiver.  Look it up, there are many takes on the Man Cold (check out<a href=""http://www.telegraph.co.uk/health/healthnews/7505207/Man-flu-is-no-myth-as-scientists-prove-men-suffer-more-from-disease.html""> this article</a>).  However, I perfer <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rXLHWmjA5IE"" target=""_blank"" title=""Funny!"">this</a> depiction of the Man Cold best because, while it's a horrible ordeal that everyone should pity, it's still really funny.    </em>Oh PUH-LEEZ.  "
 Ask Dr. Sears: Coping With Baby's Acid Reflux,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-coping-with-babys-acid-reflux,"<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=123700612&amp;src=id"">Shutterstock</a><strong>A. </strong>Acid reflux, also called gastroesophageal reflux (GER), is one of the most common infant feeding problems, with around 25 percent of all babies experience some degree of it. GER can cause a range of <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">conditions</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>, from the mild (frequent and painless spitting up) to the severe (colic, abdominal pain and frequent night waking). In fact, GER is one of the most common causes of so-called colic.<br><br>To better appreciate GER feeding strategies, it helps to know the mechanics of the condition. Normally, a circular band of muscle, called the lower esophageal sphincter (LES), separates the stomach from the esophagus. After food enters the stomach, the LES contracts, acting like a one-way valve that closes and prevents the stomach contents and acids from regurgitating, or refluxing, back up into the esophagus. In some babies, the LES is temporarily immature, so it allows partially digested stomach contents and acids to be refluxed. This irritates the lining of the esophagus and causes the pain that adults term heartburn.<br><br>If your baby has a more severe degree of reflux, your doctor may prescribe medicines that lessen the production of stomach acids. Most babies begin to outgrow the reflux between 6 and 9 months, the age at which they also start spending more time in the upright position, which itself lessens regurgitation. The following feeding and positioning tips will help minimize acid reflux.</br></br></br></br>For an infant with GER, an upright position is key, since gravity helps keep the stomach contents down. Sit with your baby on your lap with his head nestled against your chest. Keep him in this position for at least thirty minutes after a feeding.Here's my reflux rule of thumb: Feed your baby twice as often, half as much. It stands to reason that if a smaller volume of <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-bottle-drinking"">milk enters the stomach</a>, it will be digested faster and there will be less to spit back up.If you are<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/tips-for-breastfeeding-success""> breastfeeding</a>, continue exclusive breastfeeding for as long as possible. Breast milk has many advantages over formula, especially for a baby with GER. It's digested faster than formula, which minimizes reflux, and it contains enzymes that aid digestion. Also, while babies are not allergic to mother's milk, they can be to many types of formula, especially babies with GER. If formula-feeding, use a hypoallergenic formula as recommended by your baby's doctor. Besides being tolerated better by sensitive intestines, some of these formulas are digested more quickly so they remain in the stomach for a shorter time.Babies with reflux often suffer from painful night waking, since lying flat doesn't provide the benefit of gravity to keep food down. If your baby is sleeping reasonably well, there is no need to make any changes to his routine. However, if he is a restless sleeper (some clues: waking up with colic, abdominal pain, wet burps and sour breath), elevate the head of the crib about 30 degrees. This slight incline is often enough to lessen nighttime regurgitation. While it's certainly safest to put your baby to sleep on his back, if he simply won't sleep in that position, encourage him to sleep on his left side, the position in which the stomach inlet is higher than the outlet, which also helps keep food down.For help from parents who have survived and thrived with babies with reflux, visit the <a href=""http://www.reflux.org/"" target=""_new"">Pediatric and Adolescent Gastroesophageal Reflux Association</a> online."
" Breastfeeding Failure, Or Medical Community Fail?",http://www.parenting.com/blogs/natural-parenting/taylor-newman/breastfeeding-failure-or-medical-community-fail,"A lack of research, lack of funding, and lack of concern for issues affecting women and children mean more women are steered toward formula than otherwise would be if <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">doctors</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> better understood breastfeeding, and could better address individual moms’ difficulties from the get-go. The good news? This is beginning to change. Colleen Kelly, a mom whose infant daughter was diagnosed as failure to thrive when Kelly was unable to produce enough breast milk to sustain her, quickly realized – after her baby underwent tests that showed nothing to be amiss in the baby -- that ""none of the doctors or nurses knew enough about breast-feeding to figure out what was happening.” Kelly’s own mother had experienced the same supply problems as she was experiencing now, but doctor’s dismissed this family history, and Kelly ended up feeding her baby formula. She’d wanted to breastfeed, but, apparently, couldn’t.There is a widespread belief in both the pro-breastfeeding communities (which are often anti-formula) and the medical community (which has long promoted formula to moms as an A-okay convenience or choice, but rarely a medical necessity) that all women <em>can</em> breast feed… if they want to. But lactation consultants are trained in helping babies and moms get the hang of latching, and comfortable positions, and doctors – as <a href=""http://www.cnn.com/2013/01/03/health/medical-breastfeeding/index.html?hpt=hp_t4"" target=""_blank"">this recent TIME article</a>’s author points out – are barely trained in the physical aspect of breastfeeding at all. While they may know about the basic benefits of breast milk for babies – which are numerous – and that formula is a good backup option for those who choose that route, actual <em>anatomical</em> barriers to breastfeeding, in moms, are not familiar territory for most lactation consulatants or doctors, at all. As a result, moms who want to breastfeed but who experience serious supply issues end up feeling like failures, rather than finding the help they need.As the TIME article elucidates, “When women have trouble breast-feeding, they are often confronted with two divergent directives: well-meaning lactation consultants urge them to try harder, while some doctors might advise them to simply give up and go the bottle-and-formula route. ‘We just give women a pat on the head and tell them their kids will be fine,’ if they don't breastfeed, says Dr. Alison Stuebe, an OB who treats breast-feeding problems in North Carolina. ‘Can you imagine if we did that to men with erectile dysfunction?’”In fact, “Within the database of federally funded medical research, there are 70 studies on erectile dysfunction; there are 10 on lactation failure.” Lactation dysfunction isn’t even ‘real’ in medical diagnosis parlance, so doctors attempting to address it come up against a wall when it comes to billing insurance companies for their time and any relevant testing. That formula companies have long provided financial incentives to hospitals for providing their product to new moms doesn’t solve the problem, either; it provides a quick and easy (especially for busy hospital staffs) band-aid solution to moms’ lactation problems, and further discourages real research into ways to help these moms breastfeed, if that’s what they want to do. As <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/natural-parenting/taylor-newman/breastfeeding-friendly-hospitals-how-three-states-are-making-i"" target=""_blank"">more hospitals sever their corporate formula-brand ties</a>, however, and dub themselves ‘baby friendly’, the need for a deeper understanding of what makes breastfeeding work is going to be crucial. The up-side of this piece is that more research <em>is</em> beginning to take place in this sphere. And, the Affordable Health Care Act advises that health insurance companies should provide ""comprehensive lactation support and counseling, by a trained provider during pregnancy and/or in the postpartum period, and costs for renting breast-feeding equipment."" (Effective August first.) In other words, women and babies are finally getting some systemic support.Dr. Amy Evans, a pediatrician and medical director of the Center for Breastfeeding Medicine in Fresno, California, cites health problems such as hypoplasia, thyroid problems, hormonal imbalances and insufficient glandular tissue as contributing to “as many as 5%” of women having a significantly hindered ability to breastfeed. Honestly, although it may refer to the more serious medical conditions on the supply (or anatomical) problems spectrum, this number strikes me as really low. <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/natural-parenting/taylor-newman/study-two-thirds-moms-fail-meet-breastfeeding-goals"" target=""_blank""><em>Two-thirds</em> of American moms don’t meet their breastfeeding goals</a>; lack of medical and cultural support are largely to blame, and the two are intertwined. A lack of medical understanding – much of which stems from a lack of research, lack of funding, and lack of concern for issues affecting women and children (see above re: the erectile dysfunction research comparison) – means more women are steered toward formula than otherwise would be if doctors better understood breastfeeding, and could better address individual moms’ difficulties from the get-go. And a lack of cultural support – from super-short maternity leaves to workplace (or public space) hostility toward breastfeeding moms – can likewise create supply issues, for which moms can find few solutions beyond formula.One additional problem is that there’s some confusion about where these moms should turn for the help they need: “Doctors practicing today don't know where to place breast-feeding problems --breasts are attached to the women, so shouldn't they be the province of OBs, say pediatricians. And OBs note that breast-feeding is for infants; shouldn't the baby's doctor handle it?” The emerging answer here is that any of these doctors with a sub-specialty in breastfeeding medicine would be qualified as a Breasfeeding Doctor, available to help women <em>and</em> their babies – because real-life family members do not fall so cleanly into separate healthcare categories – breastfeed successfully.Last year, the AAP released <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/natural-parenting/new-aap-breastfeeding-guidelines-six-months-best-babies-and-it-takes-village"" target=""_blank"">new breastfeeding guidelines</a>, urging women to breastfeed exclusively for six months, citing the scientific research supporting the suggestion and calling upon hospitals, pediatricians, workplaces and society-at-large as responsible for American moms’ breastfeeding success. As hospitals have followed suit, the picture has broadened to reveal the ways in which our medical system – right down to the research that gets funded and the knowledge doctors are equipped with – has failed to really address the complexities of breastfeeding problems, and to find solutions beyond formula for new moms.Although some opponents to ‘baby friendly’ hospital initiatives have spoken out against new breastfeeding-friendly policies -- like <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/natural-parenting/taylor-newman/latch-nyc-its-going-be-okay-people"" target=""_blank"">those in certain New York City hospitals</a> where a medical reason must be cited before formula is given to babies -- these new policies may well be a driving force behind a better medical understanding of breastfeeding, and more solutions and support for moms. At the very least, more research will need to take place in order to create a basic medical terminology for breastfeeding problems. (Otherwise, what will medical professionals write on those formula release forms?) A diagnostic terminology will result in the ‘official’ recognition of breastfeeding as a topic within the medical field. And this recognition will lead to moms being taken seriously when they turn to their doctors for breastfeeding help. It’s about time we received something better than 'a pat on the head’ in response to our inquiries into our own bodies and well-being. New policies, more research, and a mom-friendly healthcare system – from hospitals to the insurance insurance billing breakdown – need to step up to the plate, and it looks like they may be beginning to do so now.PS.

 Health Update: Nutrient Rich Nuts,http://www.parenting.com/article/nutrient-rich-nuts,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekFor a health boost, grab a handful of nuts. They're high in fiber, protein, and some surprising nutrients. Case in point: Just two Brazil nuts (about a quarter of an ounce) deliver as much of the cell-protecting antioxidant selenium as a supplement, according to a new study. Nuts are high in fat (though it's the healthy kind), so avoid packing on the pounds by treating them as a condiment instead of a snack. Sprinkle them on salads and cereal, or toss with steamed veggies, suggests Sarah Krieger, spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association.<strong>Check out how some other nuts stack up per one-ounce serving: 12-16 walnut halves</strong> = 200 percent of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of omega-3, an essential fatty acid (175 calories) <strong>20-24 whole almonds</strong> = 35 percent of the RDA of vitamin E, which counters cholesterol (163 calories) <strong>25-30 pecan halves</strong> = 10 percent of your daily fiber needs, plus a healthy dose of oleic acid, a cholesterol-fighting fat (196 calories)."

The good news is that infants are born with large iron stores, usually enough to satisfy their needs until 4 to 6 months of age. Premature babies, however, may miss out on some or all of the significant iron accumulation that occurs during the last trimester of pregnancy. This, coupled with their ""catch-up"" growth rates, may deplete their supply by two to three months. If your baby was born early, ask your pediatrician if she needs an iron supplement.<strong>Daily dose<br/></strong>Formula meets iron needs for the first year, but breast milk doesn't, which is why pediatricians recommend introducing high-iron food early on in the second half of the first year, when you start your baby on solid foods (just remember to always finely chop round, firm foods until your child is 4 to avoid choking hazards). At 7 to 12 months, babies need 11 milligrams of elemental iron per day, and by 1 to 3 years old, 7 milligrams daily.<strong>Serve it up<br/></strong>After your baby is 6 months old, two servings of iron-fortified baby cereal (one-half ounce each) provide the 11 milligrams your baby needs, so make cereal your go-to first solid food. Meat, poultry and fish are naturally iron-packed; try giving ground beef or turkey, chicken and halibut to your little eater. Other rich sources include avocado, baked potato, broccoli, chickpeas, eggs, prunes, soybeans and spinach.<strong>Good to know<br/></strong>Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency among U.S. children. To prevent it, make sure your pediatrician screens your baby for iron-deficiency anemia at 12 months and 18 months.<strong>CALCIUM</strong><strong>Why babies need it<br/></strong>This mineral helps children achieve peak bone mass, necessary for building strong bones and preventing fractures when they start climbing trees and playing sports.<strong>Daily dose<br/></strong>Breast milk and formula meet your baby's calcium needs for the first year. Once you switch to whole milk, your baby will need 500 milligrams daily.<strong>Serve it up<br/></strong>A cup of whole milk or 6 ounces of yogurt each provides about 250 milligrams, making both bone-building powerhouses. Babies under age 1 shouldn't have cow's milk, but yogurt is typically fine once you introduce solids. Other good choices are cheese, salmon, calcium-fortified orange juice, tofu, broccoli, white beans, tomatoes and oatmeal.<strong>Good to know<br/></strong>Helping your baby develop a taste for low-fat dairy will serve him well when he gets close to puberty and his calcium needs soar (1,300 milligrams a day at age 9!), since calcium is absorbed best from food. Babies who are overweight and at risk for obesity, or who have a strong family history of early-onset cardiovascular disease, can have reduced-fat 2 percent milk between 12 and 24 months.<strong>ZINC</strong><strong>Why babies need it<br/></strong>Besides having a positive effect on cognition and development, zinc's primary roles are to maintain immune function and assure optimal cell growth and repair. Zinc deficiency is associated with impaired growth, increased susceptibility to infection and an increased risk of diarrhea.<strong>Daily dose<br/></strong>Formula meets needs through age 1, but breast milk doesn't, so it's important to introduce zinc-rich foods in the second half of the first year. Children from 7 months to 3 years of age need 3 milligrams a day.<strong>Serve it up<br/></strong>Three ounces of pork tenderloin has 2 milligrams, a cup of yogurt has 1.6 milligrams, and half a chicken breast has 1 milligram. Other good sources include turkey, beef, fish, eggs, lentils, whole milk, cheddar cheese and fortified cereal.<strong>Good to know<br/></strong>Zinc is most commonly found in iron -- rich meat, poultry and fish, so if you're meeting your baby's iron needs, chances are she's getting enough zinc too.<strong>VITAMINS A, D, E, AND K</strong><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Why babies need them</span> <br>Vitamin A promotes proper vision and healthy skin. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption and helps with bone growth -- a deficiency can cause bone-weakening rickets. Vitamin E's antioxidant powers facilitate cell growth and the development of the nervous system. Vitamin K helps with normal blood clotting.</br><strong>Daily dose<br/></strong>A shot of vitamin K is administered to newborns at birth to help prevent bleeding into the brain. Infant formula meets needs through age 1 for vitamins A, D and E. To get enough vitamin D, breastfed babies should take a supplement, such as Tri-Vi-Sol (which also contains vitamins A and C), that provides 400 IU of vitamin D daily until they are weaned from the breast or are taking 15 or more ounces of formula daily. Otherwise, if you offer your baby a variety of foods from the food pyramid -- fruits, vegetables, dairy, whole grains, healthy fats -- and your doctor says she is growing appropriately for her age, she is likely meeting her needs for these fat-soluble vitamins.<strong>Serve it up<br/></strong>Beyond breast milk, formula and cow's milk, good sources of vitamin A include carotene-rich fruits and vegetables such as carrots, sweet potatoes and broccoli. Vitamin D occurs in few foods -- which is why the AAP recommends a daily supplement for breastfed babies -- but your baby can get some from fortified cow's milk, egg yolks and fish. Vitamin E-rich foods include vegetable oils, cereals and grains. Cow's milk, leafy vegetables, fruit and soybean oil are full of vitamin K.<strong>Good to know<br/></strong>A recent study found that 40 percent of infants and toddlers have low levels of vitamin D, which can weaken bones. Make sure you talk to your pediatrician about starting your baby on a vitamin D supplement if you are breastfeeding.<strong>VITAMINS C AND B<br/></strong><strong>Why babies need them<br/></strong>Vitamin C improves iron absorption and helps prevent scurvy, a condition that causes large bruises on the body. B vitamins, including folic acid, enhance the immune and nervous systems, maintain healthy skin and muscle tone, promote cell growth and regulate metabolism.<strong>Daily dose<br/></strong>If you offer your baby a variety of foods from the food pyramid -- fruits, vegetables, dairy, whole grains, healthy fats -- and your doctor says she is growing appropriately for her age, she is likely getting enough of these water-soluble vitamins.<strong>Serve it up<br/></strong>Vitamin C is in citrus, tomatoes, strawberries, cantaloupe and potatoes. Folic acid is in green vegetables, and fortified cereals and breads. The other B vitamins are found in whole grains like brown rice as well as in bananas, beans, eggs, meat, poultry and fish. Good to know: Don't give up on the green stuff or other nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables! Most toddlers have to try a food -- as in, put it in their mouths and spit it out -- an average of eight to 10 times before they start to like it."
 Mealtime Makeovers,http://www.parenting.com/article/mealtime-makeovers,"A child's diet is a <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">work</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> in progress. Just when you think you've figured out what he'll eat  -- and won't  -- his preferences change all over again.So you wonder whether he's eating well enough. As a mother of three, I wonder the same thing. But as a registered dietitian, I know that even if a kid turns up his nose at vegetables, refuses to drink milk, or won't touch any meat except chicken nuggets, it rarely spells dietary doom. Chances are, your child's eating habits are healthier than you think, even if they could use some improvement.That's what three families found when they participated in our diet makeovers. We asked the parents to write down everything their kids ate for three days. Then we compared each child's average daily nutritional intake against what's recommended by age and found kid-approved ways for him or her to eat better.<em>Registered dietitian Elizabeth Ward's latest book is </em>Healthy Foods, Healthy Kids.<em> </em><em>Janet Zalewski marvels at her 2-year-old's energy level. ""I always wonder whether Sarah's eating enough,"" says the Chicago mom. Although she's encouraged by her toddler's curiosity about food  -- ""Like my husband, Mike, she'll try anything once""  -- she worries when Sarah sometimes won't eat what she's served. ""If she doesn't like what I make, should I offer other foods that I know she'll eat?"" It also bothers her that Sarah loves fatty foods, especially salami, hot dogs, and sausages. ""Since I'm always sure she'll eat them, I keep hot dogs in the house for a quick and easy meal,"" admits Zalewski. (To prevent choking in kids younger than 4, cut hot dogs and sausages into small pieces  -- and avoid hard candies like M&amp;M's.)</em><em><strong>Problems  -- and solutions.</strong> Sarah drinks milk at most meals and likes ice cream and yogurt, so she's well nourished in calcium and protein. But all those hot dogs and other processed meats give her too much heart-unhealthy saturated fat and sodium  -- without providing enough iron. Switching to leaner cuts of pork and beef will reduce the fat, boost iron, and lower her intake of potentially harmful sodium nitrite. Other good iron sources: eggs and iron-fortified ready-to-eat cereals.</em><em>Sarah could also benefit from boosting her intake of dietary fiber. For example, she could, as often as possible, switch from white to whole-wheat bread, from french fries to baked potatoes, and from juice to whole fruit.</em><em>There's no need for Sarah's mom to cater to her food preferences; she just needs to continue to offer a variety of nutrient-rich foods. Left to their own devices, 2-year-olds eat when they're hungry, consuming more during growth spurts, which occur less frequently than when they were babies. And Sarah's a remarkably consistent and interested eater for her age.</em><em><strong>One month later.</strong> Sarah's eating fewer processed meats and more tuna fish, eggs, and PB&amp;J and grilled cheese sandwiches. Zalewski switched her from white to whole-grain breads for toast and sandwiches. She's boosting Sarah's fruit (and fiber) intake with a few fruit smoothies a week. A tougher challenge: limiting juice consumption. ""We're both working on it,"" she says.</em><em> </em><em><strong>Breakfast</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em>   <em><strong>Lunch</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em>     <em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em> <em><strong>Dinner</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em>   <em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em> <em>Like his younger brother, 1-year-old Daniel, Fernando still drinks milk from a bottle, yet he's mastered drinking from a cup. ""Even though we don't think he eats a lot,"" says Ignacio, ""his doctor says he's doing fine.""</em><em><strong>Problems  -- and solutions.</strong> Fernando's not hungry because he drinks too much! He consumes 18 ounces of whole milk (often with cereal added) from the bottle every day  -- plus lots of fruit juice and soft drinks. Frequent snacking with large portions  -- a big bowlful of Goldfish (270 calories) plus a cup of Gatorade (60 calories)  -- also suppresses his mealtime appetite. Over time, this dietary pattern could contribute to a weight problem.</em><em>Fernando eats fast-food hamburgers frequently, which helps him meet his dietary needs for iron and zinc, and all that milk gives more than twice the necessary calcium. But the high-fat foods give him too much saturated fat, not to mention excess protein and calories. It's time to break the bottle habit, for developmental as well as dental reasons; later, he can switch to low-fat milk. Eating smaller, more nutritious snacks (such as whole-wheat pretzels or half a sandwich on whole wheat) would help enhance nutrition without squelching his desire for meals.</em><em><strong>One month later.</strong> Fernando's off sugary soft drinks and downs no more than about four ounces of juice (a half cup) twice a day. Instead of chips and crackers, he snacks on child-size portions of yogurt. He's also eating more whole-grain cereals. His appetite at mealtime has improved.</em><em>Breaking the bottle habit will have to wait until the Platas return from a long overseas vacation  -- Fernando's parents don't want to try such a big change until they're back home. He's also still very fond of high-fat fast-food meals.</em><em> </em><em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Breakfast</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Lunch</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Dinner</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em>The family's culinary open-mindedness has a downside: Adrian relies on an ever-changing menu. He's a fickle customer. Says Hale, ""It's tough to keep up  -- I never know what he'll reject next.""</em><em><strong>Problems  -- and solutions.</strong> Variety gives Adrian a big nutritional boost: He gets plenty of iron and zinc even though he takes in fewer calories than suggested for his age. (Because Adrian's growing properly, calories aren't an issue.)</em><em>More milk would give him more calcium and vitamin D. Since plain milk isn't his favorite, he could try low-fat chocolate milk and smoothies made from low-fat milk and fruit. Cheese and calcium-fortified orange juice are also good choices, although they lack vitamin D. Adrian could eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, though he still does better than most kids.</em><em><strong>One month later.</strong> Adrian has doubled his whole-grain consumption and cut his juice intake by half. When he does drink juice, it's often orange juice with added calcium. Fortified drinkable yogurt has supplied some missing calcium and vitamin D. Adding chocolate bumped up Adrian's milk intake for a while, but then he lost interest; fruit smoothies didn't fly. Neither did gazpacho or cucumber salad. But Adrian does like sliced cucumbers and celery. He's also increasingly interested in learning about the links between eating right and feeling strong.</em><em> </em><em><strong>Breakfast</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Lunch</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Dinner</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Protein.</strong> It's a key building block of all cells, yet it doesn't take much to meet a child's needs. For example, eight ounces of milk (one cup) and one ounce of cooked meat (the size of a third of a deck of cards) supply all the protein a 3-year-old needs in a day. For a 5-year-old, just add one more ounce of meat and another cup of milk. Extra protein won't hurt a child with healthy kidneys, but it can crowd out nutrient-rich vegetables and fruit.</em><em><strong>Saturated Fat.</strong> A childhood diet high in this type of fat can raise blood-cholesterol levels and lead to heart disease in adulthood if dietary patterns don't change. Starting at age 2, children should get no more than ten percent of their calories from saturated fat, although it's okay to make the shift gradually. Trans fatty acids (from partially hydrogenated oils) have similar effects. To cut back on saturated and trans fats, choose leaner cuts of meat, switch from whole to low-fat milk and dairy products, minimize fried fast foods, and limit high-fat commercial baked goods and snacks.</em><em> </em><em>When introducing new foods:</em><em> </em>     Nobody's diet is perfect, least of all a child's. That's why a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement can make sense for many kids. Always check with your pediatrician about your child's individual needs. Best bet: a kids' chewable multi (or a liquid for ages 2 and under) that supplies no more than 100% of the Daily Value for the nutrients on the label. Children who don't eat meat or poultry may need one with iron too. "
 Rethinking Juice,http://www.parenting.com/article/rethinking-juice,"<b>Look for 100 percent fruit juices.</b> Nutrient-rich picks: Purple grape juice, cranberry juice (both are high in antioxidants), and OJ, which is loaded with vitamin C, potassium, folate, and sometimes added calcium.<b>Limit yourself (and older kids) to 6 ounces a day.</b> Kids 6 months to 12 years old should have no more than 4 to 6 ounces a day. (Skip it for babies younger than 6 months.)<b>If your child wants more,</b> dilute it with water to make it go further."

Try this stuffed chicken recipe for dinner and the ham and cheese pockets for lunch.Happy National Frozen Foods Month!During the month of March, pay homage to the perennial freshness of frozen foods with recipes that feature veggies that are just as nutritious and yummy frozen as they are fresh. Did you know that frozen vegetables have just about the same amount of nutrients (in some cases more!) than fresh ones? That's because veggies are frozen at their ripest, which is when nutrients are the highest (and no one can deny the convenience factor). After transport and sitting in the produce section, many fresh vegetables start to lose nutrients quickly.According to a study by the Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior, 29% of kids chose broccoli as their favorite veggie, so it's a good bet that  these recipes will enter the rotation as favorites. This stuffed chicken-broccoli bake is serious comfort food, but it's the kind of homey recipe that packs tons of iron, lots of protein and only 5 grams of fat.<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/stuffed-chicken-and-broccoli-21354973"">Click here to see the full Stuffed Chicken Broccoli Bake recipe.</a>Use any leftover broccoli you might have for the Ham &amp; Cheese Pockets (with Broccoli).

This year, new rules on what can be sold and advertised as snacks on school grounds went into effect July 1.The regulations center on ""competitive foods,"" which are foods sold in vending machines, a la carte school lunch lines, fundraisers and student stores. Under the USDA's new <a href=""http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/allfoods_flyer.pdf"" target=""_blank"">""Smart Snacks in School""</a> standards, any snack sold on school grounds must meet all USDA requirements. This means snacks must:Jill Castle, a pediatric dietitian/nutritionist at <a href=""http://www.bundoo.com/"">Bundoo</a>, believes parents are tired of trying to teach their children healthy eating habits at home, only to have them disregarded at school. ""Too many nutrient-poor snacks (meaning they have too many calories and few or little nutrients) exist in schools, and these contribute to excess caloric intake and poor nutrient intake,"" Castle says.The main goal of the ""Smart Snacks in School"" nutrition standards is to give children healthier snack options and limit the junk food they are exposed to school.Castle says snacks are a vital part of a child's diet, and they keep kids' appetites in check to avoid overeating at meals.""Children require over 40 nutrients each day to sustain their growth and development. These nutrients must be obtained from a wide variety of foods,"" Castle says. ""Healthy snacks help kids get closer to their daily nutrition goals and meet these nutrient requirements, as long as snacks are planned with health in mind.""School fundraisers might also have to change. According to the new requirements, there are limits on the number of exempt fundraisers a school can hold. If the food being sold in a fundraiser meets all the regulatory standards, they can be sold on school campuses during the school day. But if a state agency doesn't establish limits, fundraisers can't take place in schools. Fundraisers can't go on during lunch time when other, healthier food options from the meal service are being served to kids. None of these standards apply, however, if the fundraiser is happening during non-school hours, weekends or off-campus events.The promotion of sugary drinks and junk foods during school hours will be phased out to ensure marketing campaigns around children match the USDA's health standards for school meals. Coca-Cola and Pepsi, for example, can no longer advertise their sugary drinks, but they can advertise their companies' healthier products. Any ads on cups, posters, menu boards or scoreboards at school games will eventually have to be taken down or changed.""This is just another step in taking responsibility for what goes on inside the school walls in terms of nutrition,"" Castle says. ""While school nutrition may not be perfect yet, the effort and intention to offer nutritious food to children is there and evolving."""
" Nutrition Labels, Decoded",http://www.parenting.com/article/nutrition-labels-decoded-1203711328503,"<span class=""blue10b""><b>Serving Size</b></span><br><b>Start here, since the rest of the label's info is based on this number.</b> You might have to do some quick math when it comes to food for kids: If your toddler snacks on only 1/2 cup of cereal and the serving size is 1 cup, adjust accordingly to find out what nutrients he's getting. Also crucial: the ""servings per container"" line. Since many snacks (like a 16-ounce bottle of juice) actually have two servings per container, you'll have to double all the numbers if you end up scarfing down the whole thing. <br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Calories</b></span><br>One of the least important numbers for kids under 5, if they're at a normal weight. ""Little kids are more tuned in to their hunger than we are, so they can usually regulate their own calories,"" says Jeannie Gazzaniga-Moloo, Ph.D., a dietitian in Sacramento, California, and spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association (ADA). <b>For school-age kids -- and younger, if they're overweight -- you'll want to pay closer attention to how many calories they're taking in.</b> The ADA's recommended calorie intake:<br><b>Ages 2-3:</b> 1,000 to 1,400 calories per day <br><b>Ages 4-8:</b> 1,200 to 1,800 calories per day (boys need slightly more calories, and so do really active kids) <br><b>Ages 9-13:</b> 1,600 to 2,200 calories per day for girls; 1,800 to 2,600 calories per day for boys.<br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Calories From Fat</b></span><br><b>Kids should get 30 to 35 percent of their daily calories from fat,</b> while adults should shoot for less than 30 percent. An easy way to calculate fat calories: Look for a low ""calories from fat"" number. For example, a 100-calorie snack should have fewer than 30 calories from fat. <br><br><b><span class=""blue10b"">Cholesterol</span></b><br><b>Both kids and adults need to take in around 300 mg of cholesterol per day</b>, in part to make the myelin sheath that surrounds the body's nerves. While it's true that too much cholesterol can build up in the arteries and cause heart disease, experts now know that trans and saturated fats play a bigger role in raising blood cholesterol than does the cholesterol in food. The bottom line: Shoot for foods low in cholesterol, but you don't have to avoid it at all costs. <br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Sodium</b></span><br>The daily recommended allowance for kids: <br><b>Ages 2-3:</b> 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day<br><b>Ages 4-8:</b> 1,200 to 1,900 mg per day <br><b>Ages 9-13:</b> 1,500 to 2,200 mg per day <br>Since sodium may raise blood pressure in some people, the <b>maximum recommended for adults is 2,300 mg</b> -- about one teaspoon of salt! Of course, we all consume far more than that thanks to the amount of processed foods we eat. (Just one cup of boxed mac and cheese has nearly 600 mg.) And since most restaurant food is typically higher in sodium, it's smart to limit sodium-rich foods at home. <br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Vitamins </b></span><br>Vitamins and minerals are essential for growing kids, but your child is likely getting most of what she needs as long as she really eats things from every food group.<b> The nutrients kids most often lack include vitamins A, B6, C, and D and the minerals calcium, iron, and zinc.</b> See the % Daily Value to find out if a food is a good source of the vitamins and minerals listed on the label.<br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>% Daily Value</b></span><br><b>The percentage of nutrients in a food, based on the Food and Drug Administration's recommended daily intake. </b>The percentages are keyed to a 2,000-calorie diet, though, so a quick way to figure out what your child is getting is to use the percentage as a clue to whether a food is high or low in certain nutrients. A food that's 5 percent or less is considered to be low in that nutrient; if it's between 10 percent and 19 percent, it's a good source; 20 percent or higher means it's an excellent source.<br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Fats</b></span><br>We all need some fat to absorb vitamins, help our internal organs work efficiently, and keep us feeling satisfied after meals -- and it's especially important for kids' brain development. <b>But it's the type of fat to zero in on here.</b> When you check out a label, look for a low saturated-fat content and little or no trans fat. For both adults and children over 2, fewer than 10 percent of daily calories should come from saturated fat. Shortcut: Try to limit -- or, better, avoid -- packaged foods with a saturated-fat content over 1.5 grams per serving.<br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Carbohydrates</b></span><br><b>Pay attention to total carbohydrates, as well as the amount of dietary fiber and sugars in a food.</b> For a good idea of the type of fiber and sugar it contains, check the ingredients list. Whole-grain fiber is ideal, and should be high on the list, while sugars (which may be hiding under names that end in ""ose,"" like sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup) should be lower. <br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Ingredients</b></span><br><b>These are always listed from the greatest to smallest quantity,</b> so the first three to five ingredients will give you a sense of how healthy a food is. ""In general, you want to look for those that are recognizable, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and steer clear of anything that's hydrogenated, which signifies that it's a trans fat,"" says Gazzaniga- Moloo.

Here's some advice you can safely swallow.<b>100 percent is plenty.</b> ""Those that offer 300 percent aren't any more helpful,"" says Elizabeth Ward, RD, author of <i>Expect the Best: Your Guide to Healthy Eating Before, During &amp; After Pregnancy</i>.<b>Look for the ""USP verified"" symbol.</b> It's not a guarantee, but supplements that have been approved by the U.S. Pharmacopeia, a nonprofit health agency, are typically of good quality.<b>Consider a prescription prenatal.</b> Folic acid and iron are particularly crucial nutrients for women who are in the process of trying to get pregnant, the group that prenatals are tailored to.<b>Eat smart.</b> ""Our bodies absorb nutrients best from food,"" says Ward. ""A diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, lean protein and whole grains is always your best bet."""
 Pick the Right Multivitamin,http://www.parenting.com/article/pick-the-right-multivitamin,"<b>Look for the official seal.</b> Products approved by the U.S. Pharmacopeia Dietary Supplement Verification Program (USP-DSVP) meet certain safety and quality standards.<b>Check how much you're getting.</b> For trace minerals such as iron, fluoride, and zinc, it's safest not to exceed the daily value. Don't forget that what you get from fortified foods, like many breakfast cereals, counts, too.<b>Choose a product for women.</b> It's more likely to contain the right doses of the nutrients you need most  -- calcium and vitamin D for better bone health, folic acid to prevent birth defects, and iron for replacing what's lost during periods. (If you're pregnant, take a prenatal vitamin; it has more of what you and your baby need.) <b>Ignore gimmicks.</b> Whether a vitamin is derived from natural sources or synthesized in a lab, your body uses it the same way. There's also no need to pay more for allergen-free multis if you're not sensitive to specific ingredients.<b>Beware of dangerous interactions.</b> Pay attention to the warnings on labels, and always tell your doctor or pharmacist what supplements you're taking."

 Raising a Veggie Baby,http://www.parenting.com/article/raising-a-veggie-baby,"""Infants and toddlers grow at an astounding rate,"" says Ruth A. Lawrence, M.D., professor of pediatrics, obstetrics, and gynecology at the University of Rochester Medical Center. ""To fuel their physical growth and brain development, they use energy (or calories) at three times the rate of adults. And if nothing else, meat and dairy products are concentrated sources of calories and certain nutrients.""A baby who eats little or no animal products is more likely to lack adequate calories, protein, fat, calcium, iron, vitamin D, and vitamin B12, says William Cochran, M.D., associate professor of clinical pediatrics at Pennslyvania State University College of Medicine/Geisinger Medical Center. A deficiency of any of these crucial nutrients can affect everything from proper growth to nerve and brain development. Be sure to inform your pediatrician that your family is vegetarian, so that she too can be vigilant about checking for signs of nutritional deficiency at your child's regular visits. That said, here's a taste of what you need to know to keep Baby healthy and strong.If you're vegan and avoid all animal products (including cow's milk), be aware that any child under age 2 should be consuming breast milk or soy formula that's fortified with iron and vitamin D, cautions Dr. Cochran. Letting Baby play in the sun for 10 or 15 minutes without suncreen a few times a week will also help ensure proper vitamin D levels. Breast milk and formula will also provide a good deal of Baby's calcium. Other good sources for older babies include calcium-fortified soy milk, rice milk, and orange juice.Finding dietary sources of B12, however, may prove more difficult. Some cereals and soy milks are fortified. You can also sprinkle Red Star Vegetarian Support Formula nutritional yeast into Baby's food (it's a little like parmesan cheese). If you're worried that your child isn't getting enough calcium, iron, vitamin B12 or D, talk to your doctor about whether vitamin supplements are necessary.Families that eschew meat but still eat eggs and dairy products (lacto-ovo-vegetarians) have less to worry about. These foods contain most of the nutrients found in beef and chicken. Just remember that variety is key. Some of the most nutritious foods for all babies include sweet potatoes, bananas, avocados, papaya, cooked carrots, applesauce, and pureed split pea or lentil soup. Lacto-ovo-vegetarians should, of course, offer cheeses and yogurt.""Ultimately, it doesn't matter if your child is a vegetarian or not, as long as he is getting the nutrients he needs in the right number of calories,"" says Dr. Lawrence. ""The bottom line is that eating is a family affair. The emphasis of meals should be as much on relaxation and sharing as it is on counting nutrients."""
 Top Taste Shapers,http://www.parenting.com/article/top-taste-shapers,"<b>Avocados.</b> One of my favorite first foods, avocados (cut into small pieces or mashed in guacamole) contain healthy monounsaturated fat, perfect for developing brains.<b>Beans.</b> Different types of beans offer different health benefits, but all of them are a great source of fiber and protein.<b>Blueberries.</b> One of the very best sources of antioxidants (compounds that fight aging, heart disease, and cancer) out there. Plus, babies love them! (For safety's sake, give your infant only blueberries that are pea-size or smaller.)<b>Flaxseed meal.</b> Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help boost your baby's brainpower and ward off high cholesterol. Sprinkle it on your baby's cereal, yogurt, or soup (it has a slightly nutty flavor). <b>Eggs.</b> An important source of protein. (Give only the egg yolk to infants under 1 year old.)<b>Oatmeal.</b> Oats are one of the most nutrient-rich types of grains, and oatmeal is a wonderfully filling breakfast or snack.<b>Spinach.</b> A real ""power"" vegetable, spinach is packed with folate, iron, and calcium.<b>Tofu.</b> A great non-meat alternative to protein, without all the saturated fat some meats have. Soy (which tofu is made from) is one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet  -- and takes on the flavor of whatever you pair it with.<b>Tomatoes.</b> A terrific source of vitamins A and C, plus lycopene, a powerful antioxidant. So ladle on that pasta sauce!<b>Whole grains.</b> Carbohydrates are an important part of a balanced diet; just make sure the ones your kids eat are made from whole grains and pack a nutritional punch, unlike processed white breads.<b>Yogurt.</b> Besides yogurt's being an excellent source of calcium and protein, the live healthy bacteria in it is great for kids' digestive tracts.<b>Salmon.</b> You'd be surprised how many infants love the taste of this fatty-acid-filled fish. Try to buy wild salmon; it contains fewer toxins than the farmed variety."

 Keeping Breast Milk Fresh?,http://www.parenting.com/article/keeping-breast-milk-fresh,"<strong>Q.</strong> How long does expressed milk keep?<strong>A.</strong> Refrigerated breast milk, which can be stored in glass, plastic, or stainless steel containers, is best used within 48 hours. Frozen milk keeps for three months if your freezer has a separate door, two weeks if it doesn't. Freeze expressed milk in glass or plastic containers, or in bags designed for freezer storage, and thaw it by <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">running</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> the container under cool, then warm water until it's at room temperature.

Though expressed milk loses a few vitamins and minerals, the amounts are so small there's no need to be concerned, says Jay Gordon, M.D., a pediatrician who advises La Leche League, in Santa Monica, CA."

Researchers found that 114 of them contained at least 30 percent of the <em style=""background-color: initial;"">adult</em> daily value of vitamin A, zinc and niacin, nutrients that can be harmful in too-large quantities. Twenty-three cereals were fortified with greater amounts of these nutrients than is deemed safe for children under the age of 8. Many of these cereals are familiar brands made by Kellogg's and General Mills.The findings indicate that more than 10 million kids in the United States are <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-vitamin-overdose"">consuming excessive amounts of vitamins</a>. Compounding the problem are outdated labeling—the FDA hasn't updated many of its daily value formulas since 1968—and the fact that the recommended amounts and percentages on the labels are calculated for adults.""We've gained a lot of knowledge in the last 45-plus years,"" says Danelle Fisher, vice chair of pediatrics at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif.Fisher says the message for parents is not to stop serving cereal to their kids. Rather, it's to practice moderation. After all, these foods are fortified with vitamins, but they are also processed.""Parents need to be discerning and be conscious of labels; they are there for a reason,"" she says. ""Mix it up. Add eggs, pancakes, fruit and yogurt to your breakfast rotation. Find other go-to snacks.

On top of that, women carrying multiples need another 150 to 300 calories for each additional baby, says Ellie Krieger, R.D., nutritionist and new mom. That translates to 450 to 600 extra calories a day for twins, and 600 to 900 for triplets.But eating 600 calories' worth of marshmallows probably isn't the best way to help your babies grow. ""The key to pregnancy nutrition is that you have to get the most nutrient-dense foods possible, because you need a lot of extra nutrients without a lot of extra calories. This becomes even more important when you're carrying multiples,"" says Krieger.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends getting those extra calories from calcium- and protein-rich snacks. A few great choices (all about 300 calories): a cup of lowfat yogurt and a piece of fresh fruit; two eggs and a piece of whole-grain toast; a cup of cooked black or pinto beans topped with low-fat, pasteurized cheddar cheese; or four fig bars with a glass of skim milk.Although increasing your daily calorie intake with healthy foods should provide the extra vitamins and minerals your babies need to develop, your physician may also prescribe additional prenatal vitamins and iron supplements for multiples. ""The bottom line,"" says Krieger, ""is that you want to gain weight appropriately."" Follow the guidelines on the right from the March of Dimes, track your weight, and increase or decrease your diet accordingly. If you're feeling overly tired or if you're gaining too much or too little weight, talk to your doctor."

 Got Milk? The Benefits of Milk for Kids,http://www.parenting.com/article/got-milk,"Get the fact on why your <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">children</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> should drink milk, how much, and what kind.When we were growing up, the case for milk was clear: It was good for you, your parents told you to drink it (which you did or, defiantly, didn't), end of story. Since then, researchers have been taking a closer look at the benefits of dairy products, and this has confused the issue of how much kids need, when they need it and what kind they should get. The facts:Cow's milk isn't digested well by babies under 12 months, and it lacks essential nutrients supplied by breast milk and formula. So hold off on introducing it until your baby's at least a year old. (The cow's milk in cow's milk-based formula is safe for babies.)Until your child is 2, whole milk. ""He needs the fat for nerve and brain development,"" says Frank Greer, M.D., chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics's Committee on Nutrition. A possible exception: If your child's gaining weight too quickly for his height, your pediatrician may recommend switching to low-fat milk before age 2.<br>Otherwise, switch to 1- or 2-percent milk at age 2 to move your child closer to a diet with moderate amounts of fat and cholesterol. As long as he doesn't have a weight problem, he can drink 1 or 2 percent indefinitely, rather than switching to skim. Kids need the fat for nerve development for many years.</br>Despite common wisdom, recent research looking at the long-term bone-building effects of dairy products has produced mixed results. ""But we do know that three factors determine strong bones: genetics, physical activity and calcium,"" says Dr. Greer. ""And milk is the number one source of calcium."" Milk is also fortified with vitamin D, another important player in bone health, and it has other vital nutrients, including protein, phosphorous, vitamin A and some B vitamins. Bottom line: Milk is good for bones, but other factors matter, too.Recent U.S. dietary guidelines have raised the number of recommended servings of dairy products from two to three a day for kids between 4 and 8. It's still two servings a day for kids under 4. (For kids 9 to 18, it's four servings.) One cup of milk or yogurt or 1.5 ounces of cheese (equivalent to six dice-size cubes) counts as a serving.<br>But keep in mind that all dairy products are not created equal. Yogurt, for instance, has more protein and sometimes has more calcium than milk, but it's rarely fortified with vitamin D.</br>The jury is still out on this, particularly for kids. Some studies have shown that the more dairy foods they consume, the less body fat they put on over time. Yet a recent Harvard study found that young children who drank more than three servings of milk a day gained more weight over a period of one year—whether they drank whole or low-fat milk. Helaine Rockett, one of the study authors, thinks it's wise to keep milk drinking in perspective. ""Milk is healthy, but it does have calories. If your child is overweight, switch him to water once he meets his servings of dairy for the day.""Yup. In addition to the extra calories, too much milk can fill kids up, increasing the likelihood that they forgo other nutrient-rich foods. So limit your child to the recommended servings per day and make sure he gets a wide variety of nutritious foods.There aren't many foods that offer the same package of nutrients, but there are other sources of calcium. Besides other dairy foods, fortified OJ, fortified tofu, white beans and broccoli, some cereals and cereal bars are fortified with it. Before you give up on milk, though, try offering the flavored kind. The extra sugar is a worthy trade-off for milk's nutrients.<br><br>Learn more about the befinits of <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/dha-a-smart-supplement"">DHA for Kids: Brain-boosting Supplement</a></br></br>"

Focusing on good nutrition, diverse food options and healthy snacks, rather than calories and weight, can help teach kids how to eat healthy and make smart decisions for themselves.""Instilling good eating habits early can help put a child on the path to a healthy future,"" says Dr. Kathleen Reidy, a registered dietitian and head of Nutrition Science for Meals and Drinks in Nestlé's Infant Nutrition department.Reidy is the lead author of <a href=""http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?mID=3445&amp;sKey=4a0019aa-3f7b-42f2-99c4-f152a77fdde4&amp;cKey=7fd8db4d-f161-47bc-b4e7-f55ccdf2f8fe&amp;mKey=5b9d1ebb-5eef-4e8e-9ffa-641686838541"" target=""_blank"">Nestlé's Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study</a> (FITS), which is the largest dietary-intake survey of young children from birth to 4 years old in the United States.""Nestlé realized a huge gap in nutrition information available for this age group, and this study help fills that gap,"" Reidy says. ""It is a valuable resource in the pediatric and health community and referenced by organizations, such as the <a href=""http://www.fda.gov"" target=""_blank"">FDA</a> and <a href=""http://www.aap.org/en-us/Pages/Default.aspx"" target=""_blank"">AAP</a>.""The initial study was completed in 2002, and Nestlé has continued to collect and analyze data and learn from it. The findings that were published in 2008 have been updated and were presented at the 2014 <a href=""http://experimentalbiology.org/2014/Home.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Experimental Biology</a> conference on April 28 in San Diego, Calif.<strong>The</strong> <strong>power</strong> <strong>of snacks</strong><br>At a time when <a href=""http://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/smart-snacks-school"" target=""_blank"">Smart Snacks in Schools</a> nutrition standards and guidelines are being implemented across the United States, these insights may have implications for helping address childhood obesity even before kids go to school.</br>""Our findings indicate snacks provide a significant portion—25 percent—of calories in children 1 to 4 years old,"" Reidy says.The study also found that young children who consume snacks away from home—at daycare, friends' houses or while running errands with Mom or Dad—eat an additional 50 calories per day.<a href=""http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?mID=3445&amp;sKey=4a0019aa-3f7b-42f2-99c4-f152a77fdde4&amp;cKey=9e7cedfc-bda9-4c5d-b082-4ea24a3d93c6&amp;mKey=5b9d1ebb-5eef-4e8e-9ffa-641686838541"" target=""_blank"">According to the study</a>, children who eat one or more snacks away from home are more likely to consume sweets, such as cookies, candy and sweetened beverages, and less likely to consume milk.<strong>Dairy intake</strong><br>Milk is key in children's diets and a top contributor of many important nutrients, including protein; calcium; vitamins A, D and B12; thiamin; and riboflavin. However, it was found to be one of the top sources of saturated fat in children's diets because they were generally consuming whole or two percent milk. Therefore, the recommendation is not for parents to limit milk, but instead to offer lower-fat options, such as one percent and skim.</br>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breast milk from 0 to 12 months old, whole milk from 1 to 2 years old and low-fat milk after age 2. If heart disease runs in a child's family, the AAP advises switching to low-fat milk at 1 year old.""Nestlé supports the <a href=""http://www.who.int/en/"" target=""_blank"">World Health Organization</a>'s recommendation of <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/tips-for-breastfeeding-success"">breastfeeding</a> children for the first six months their lives, then introducing safe and appropriate complementary foods, preferably while continuing to breastfeed, until children turn 2,"" Reidy says. ""Whenever you make the switch to low-fat milk, make sure you add healthy fat. Avocado, fish and products made with olive, canola and safflower oils are all good sources of it. Children do need fat but tend to not get enough healthy fat.""<strong>Nutrients</strong> <strong>on</strong> <strong>the go</strong><br>Kids also have trouble getting enough of the daily recommended amount of nutrients, such as calcium to build strong bones; iron to make hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells; potassium to aid in nerve and muscle function and water balance; and fiber to help with digestion and food intake.</br>""Nutrition issues during this period can have lifelong effects,"" Reidy says. ""The period of 0 to 4 years old is such a critical time in child development because every organ system in kids' bodies is developing and being shaped and formed rapidly.""Reidy says families can play an important role in this development by <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/gallery/healthy-kids-snacks"">providing nutritious snacks</a>, especially when on the go, by cutting up fresh fruits or precooked veggies to pack in to-go containers.Many food distributors, such as <a href=""https://www.gerber.com/Home"" target=""_blank"">Gerber</a>, which is part of Nestlé, package healthy snacks in convenient pouches or single-serving containers.""Snacks provide nutrition throughout the day for energy, so think of them as mini-meals rather than treats,"" Reidy says. ""Plan ahead, and talk to your child's other caretakers, such as family members and daycare providers, to make sure you're on the same page.""<strong>Fruits and veggies</strong><br>During the second year, it is especially important for parents to provide healthy options when transitioning their kids to table food. According to Reidy, between 9 and 11 months old, kids consume more veggies than at any other time between birth and 4 years old. When baby food drops out of the diet, kids consume much fewer veggies and the quality of the veggies changes. For example, starchy potatoes replace vitamin-rich yellow and green veggies.</br>To help kids get the nutrients they need, Reidy recommends <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/food-recipes/snacks/10-creative-healthy-snacks-kids"">snacks that contain a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables</a>, low-fat dairy and whole grains and ones that limit saturated fat, sugar and sodium.""Expose kids to different tastes and textures, and pay attention to the developmental appropriateness of foods. Kids don't always have the motor skills to eat a wide variety of food,"" Reidy says. ""It's important to track your child's growth and check with his or her pediatrician for individualized nutrition plans.""Gerber provides a number of valuable resources on child nutrition on its website, <a href=""https://www.gerber.com/Home"" target=""_blank"">Gerber.com</a>.

Start with these simple rules.<strong>1: Never Leave Home Without Your Water Bottle</strong>""Hydration plays a major role in energy,"" notes Ashley Koff, R.D. That's especially true if you're breastfeeding, since nursing places even more demand on your fluid levels. Dehydration reduces blood volume, so less blood reaches your organs -- including your brain -- leaving you light-headed and dizzy. Drink water or seltzer, or shop the produce aisle. ""Aim for at least 6 'hydration occasions' a day, which can include water-based vegetables,"" says Koff.<b>2: Don't Forget to Eat</b>With all the hullaballoo that comes with getting your little one fed, changed, and dressed, it's no wonder many moms grab a quick snack instead of a healthy meal. ""Aim to eat a balanced meal or snack every three hours,"" says Koff. That means a mix of healthy carbs, protein and fat -- like whole-grain cereal with milk and chopped nuts, or plain Greek yogurt with berries and almonds -- to keep you satisfied.<b>3: Don't Use Coffee as a Crutch</b>Sure, you'll score a quick buzz from a double-shot latte, but prepare to bonk shortly thereafter. That's also true for energy drinks and sweets. ""Energy fixes are often energy zappers in disguise,"" says Koff. ""You'll spike, but then you'll be set up for a major crash.""<b>4: Get the Right Mix of Nutrients</b>For a more natural, long-lasting boost, consume plenty of vitamins and minerals -- especially B vitamins (B6, B12 and folic acid, which help break food down into energy), and vitamin D, which plays a role in blood sugar regulation. Key foods include leafy vegetables, whole grains, eggs, grass-fed beef, shrimp, scallop and sardines."
 Avocados and Folic Acid,http://www.parenting.com/article/avocados-and-folic-acid,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekHoly guacamole! If you thought avocados were only good for chip dip, think again. Packed with folic acid and heart-healthy fat, consider the avocado a wonder fruit (yes, it's a fruit) for expectant moms and babies alike.<strong>Moms-to-be:</strong>Avocados contain more folate per ounce than any other fruit, with 45 micrograms per half cup. That's good news because folate (also called folic acid) is a key prenatal nutrient which produces and maintains new cells. Getting enough of it during your first trimester is essential because your baby's central nervous system (including the brain and spinal cord) forms during this time, explains Joseph Hersh, M.D., a pediatrician at the University of Louisville School of Medicine, in Kentucky, and a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, and ""folic acid has been shown to lower the risk of birth defects.""As a result, pregnant women and women trying to conceive are advised to take 400 micrograms of folic acid a day. And although your doctor will prescribe a prenatal vitamin that contains the nutrient, it's also a great idea to get as much as you can from food.Bonus: Avocados are the only fruit that contain monounsaturated fat, which helps protect against heart disease, so you can happily say the words ""diet"" and ""fat"" in the same sentence.<strong>Babies:</strong>Monounsaturated fat is also necessary in the diet of your new bundle of joy. Once your baby is able to eat solid foods, avocados can help provide her with the ""good"" fat she needs for cognitive and visual development. Plus, avocados have more of the energy-boosting potassium your baby needs to grow than bananas.If you're unsure how to incorporate avocado into your family's diet, try one of these easy recipes from the California Avocado Commission:<b>Avocado wrap-up</b><i>The perfect low-fat snack for pregnant moms</i>2 teaspoons ripe avocado, mashed1 fajita-size, fat-free flour tortilla1 slice of deli turkey, heated until steaming1 thin slice of low-fat pasteurized cheese1/2 teaspoon jarred barbecue sauce1/4 cup carrots, peeled and coarsely shreddedSpread mashed avocado on tortilla to within 1 inch of the edge.

The brain grows more during the first two years of life than any other time, nearly tripling in size from birth to two years of age. It's clearly a crucial time for brain development, and the intellectual advantage breastfed babies enjoy is attributed to the ""smart fats"" unique to mom's breast milk (namely, omega-3 fatty acid, also known as DHA). From head to toe, babies who breastfeed for extended periods of time are healthier overall.”</em>We’re psyched a celebrity is promoting breastfeeding (here are <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/gallery/Mom/Breastfeeding-Celebrity-Moms"">some other celebs who’ve shared their experiences with nursing</a>), but let’s make sure the facts are out there."

 Iron-Clad Nutrition,http://www.parenting.com/article/iron-clad-nutrition-21354364,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekDuring pregnancy a woman's daily requirement for iron doubles, from 15 to 30 milligrams -- and no wonder: Iron is a major component of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen throughout the body and to the placenta. It also enables both mother and fetus to form new red blood cells. Getting enough iron becomes especially important in the second and third trimesters, when maternal blood volume increases and the fetus begins to store the mineral for the first few months after birth.A shortage of iron can leave an expectant mom tired, pale, and infection-prone. If you have a deficiency, your doctor may prescribe an iron supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamin. However, you should still aim to eat at least four or five servings of iron-rich foods each day. For an extra boost, preparing foods in cast-iron cookware can increase their iron content. You can also enhance your body's absorption of iron by pairing foods containing iron with a source of vitamin C (a snack of raisins and orange juice, a tomato-and-ground beef pasta sauce), and combining meat sources of iron with nonmeat sources (as in beef-and-bean chili). Because the tannin in tea and the polyphenols in coffee can interfere with iron absorption, avoid drinking them with meals."

Second-borns conceived between 12 and 23 months after a first child’s birth had twice the risk of autism compared to babies conceived 3 or more years following an older sibling’s birth.Researchers at Columbia University studied birth records from 662,730 second-born children from California, who were born between 1992 and 2002 and who didn’t have an older sibling with autism. According to data provided by California’s Department of Developmental Services, 3,137 second-borns in this group had received a diagnosis of autism by age 6. Because the birth records included information about parental education level, birth weight, and age, researchers were able to account for a number of factors in their calculations, but they still found a link between shorter intervals between births and a higher risk of autism.Although researchers were not able to state definitively that delaying a second pregnancy would lower the risk of autism, the findings may indicate a change in the uterine environment in the years immediately following pregnancy, such as a deficiency in certain nutrients.

Even kids who seem to be picky eaters or who don't eat a varied diet usually do a pretty good job of consuming all the important vitamins and minerals they need. So for most children who are otherwise healthy and have no dietary restrictions, a daily multivitamin is probably not necessary.That said, the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends vitamin D supplementation in all infants, whether breast- or bottle-fed, from birth to possibly even adolescence. This is different from the old recommendation to give vitamin D only to breastfed infants. Studies show that toddlers, older kids, and even some adults are vitamin D—deficient and could benefit from supplements. Vitamin D keeps bones strong and healthy, and plays a role in keeping the immune system strong as well.There are also certain groups of kids, such as vegetarians and those with food sensitivities who require a strictly controlled diet, who might benefit from a daily multivitamin. It's a good idea to discuss your child's vitamin D intake, as well as other important nutrients such as calcium and iron, with your pediatrician.One more important point to make about vitamins: They can be toxic when taken in excess. Many are designed to look and taste like candy, and a child who takes more than the recommended daily dose could wind up in the emergency room. So be sure to treat vitamins like any other medication: Always keep them locked up and out of reach.<strong>Lara Zibners, M.D.,</strong> penned <em>If Your Kid Eats This Book, Everything Will Still Be Okay</em>.

 On Call: Sneaking In Veggies,http://www.parenting.com/article/on-call-sneaking-in-veggies,"<strong>Q. Our toddler hates vegetables. Are <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">juices</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> a good substitute?<br><br>A. </br></br></strong>Don't give up so fast! This is the perfect time to teach your child healthy habits, while he'll still listen to you and before TV and junk-food-loving friends can influence him. Vegetable juices don't pack the fiber or same variety of nutrients that actual veggies do, so they should really be an addition to your child's diet instead of a substitute. To make sure juices are healthy, look for ones with no added salt or sugar, or make your own in a blender or juicer.The best way to get your kid to eat vegetables is to keep offering them (it can take ten or more tries before a child accepts a new food). Top them with cheese, salad dressing, or ketchup, or stir them into soups or sauces  -- get creative! Veggie burgers are a fave of my just-turned-2-year-old, and I mix frozen vegetables into almost anything else I'm giving him.Remember, too, that if you eat <em>your</em> veggies, your child is more likely to do the same."
 Vitamins for Picky Eaters,http://www.parenting.com/article/vitamins-for-picky-eaters,"I think my 3-year old needs a multivitamin, but what kind is best?First, don't give up on his diet! It can take lots of tries before some kids realize that broccoli, mango, or flounder actually tastes good. Keep putting different foods on his plate. You never know what might happen. That said, most children, including picky eaters, don't need multivitamins if they are getting at least some of all the food groups on a somewhat daily basis, especially meat, vegetables (all colors), dairy, and fruit. If your child isn't, visit your doctor to go over his diet to see if a multivitamin makes sense, and if so, whether to get one with iron.If your pediatrician thinks a vitamin is a good idea but doesn't have a specific brand in mind, you'll have to read labels carefully because nutrient amounts vary between brands. And because most vitamins for kids are designed for ages 4 and up, you'll likely need to split each pill in half for a 3-year-old, not always easy.The good news is that there are all sorts of colors, shapes, and flavors available, designed to tempt the most picky children (though many kids don't like the liquid formulas). In fact, chewable vitamins can be yummy, so you could have another problem, stopping your son from eating more than one. Overdosing can be dangerous; make sure he knows they're not candy, and store them out of reach."
 Is Your Baby Ready for Cow's Milk?,http://www.parenting.com/article/is-your-baby-ready-for-cows-milk,"<strong>When should we start?</strong> When your baby turns 1. Before that, she needs the specific nutrients that breast milk and formula provide, says Laura Jana, M.D., coauthor of the American Academy of Pediatrics's (AAP) book, Food Fights. Younger babies also may not tolerate the proteins in cow's milk well.<strong>Whole or reduced fat?</strong> The AAP now advises that any child with a family history of obesity, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes drink 1% or 2% (but never skim) milk. Babies at risk of becoming overweight (both parents are overweight or the child is in the 85th or higher weight percentile) should also avoid whole milk, says Jatinder Bhatia, M.D., of the AAP's Committee on Nutrition.<strong>How should I introduce it?</strong> ""Most babies can go cold turkey,"" says Dr. Jana.

 Are Eggs Healthy For Babies?,http://www.parenting.com/article/are-eggs-healthy-for-babies,"Just in time for spring, here are three common egg myths, unscrambled:<b>Myth: Infants should only eat the yolk.</b> Egg whites are the most allergenic, which is why, for years, doctors advised only serving infants the yolk. But there's no clear evidence that delaying the introduction of common allergenic foods prevents the development of allergies, serves no purpose that a more recent recommendation from the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that delaying the introduction of common allergenic foods serves no purpose, even if you have a family history of allergies. What it means: No more separating yolks! Scramble up the whole kit and caboodle whenever your child is ready for solid foods. The exception: If your child has already shown allergic reactions (an allergic rash, for example), talk to your pediatrician about when to introduce eggs.<b>Myth: Babies should only eat a few eggs per week since they are so high in cholesterol.</b> Infants' actually need more fat and cholesterol than adults for their still-developing brains and organs. So your baby can handle a whole egg every day. Plus, not only does the yolk contain half of the protein in the egg, it carries most of the egg's 13 essential nutrients, including hard-to-get choline, folate, and vitamin D.<b>Myth: Dyed eggs aren't safe for babies.</b> It's true, dyes can penetrate an egg's porous shell, but in such small amounts that they're perfectly safe. More worrisome is the amount of time the colored eggs spend outside the fridge -- ones left out for more than two hours should be discarded or used for decoration only."
 Why Babies Should Eat Fish,http://www.parenting.com/article/fish-for-babies,"Sure, we already know that <span class=""il"">fish</span> is <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">healthy</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>. But did you know that it may also reduce an infant’s risk of developing asthma later in life?You already know that fish is a healthy food, full of heart-boosting, brain-building omega-3 fatty acids, but here's another good reason to help your tot develop a taste for it: Babies between 6 months and 1 year who eat fish have a 36 percent lower risk of developing asthma later in life, according to a large-scale study of more than 7,000 infants published in the journal <em>Pediatrics</em>. “This six-month window may be a time when a child's immune system is being programmed, and nutrients found in fish—omega-3 fatty acids and vitamin D—could influence this process,” says lead study author Jessica C. Kiefte-de Jong, Ph.D., a pediatric epidemiologist in the Netherlands.“Fish's soft, chewable texture makes it a great first food,” says registered dietitian Karen Ansel, author of <em>The Baby and Toddler Cookbook</em> and a member of <em>Parenting</em>'s advisory board. Opt for boneless and skinless fish, like canned salmon or U.S.-raised tilapia. Start with a puree of fish and a little vegetable broth. As they get older, serve small pieces of broiled fish or fold it into macaroni and cheese or pasta dishes. And be sure to avoid fish high in mercury: swordfish, shark, tilefish, and king mackerel."
" Baby Food Pouches, Yay or Nay?",http://www.parenting.com/blogs/kid-friendly-recipes/katherine-choi/baby-food-pouches,"<p class=""p1"">Pouches are the newest baby-food trend—but not all experts are buying it.<p class=""p1"">Baby food used to be as predictable as a jar of strained pears, but these days stores are filled with colorful pouches in foodie flavors like Peach Mango. With companies reporting double-digit sales growth in recent months, pouches seem to be all the rage—but how do they compare with traditional jars? We asked two experts to weigh in.<p class=""p1""><strong>“POUCHES ARE A GREAT ON-THE-GO OPTION.”</strong><br>“The popularity of pouches reflects how busy we are as a society,” says Kate Geagan, a registered dietitian in Salt Lake City. “I don't think they should <em>replace</em> jars—you don't want to lose the intimate connection of spoon-feeding your baby. But many pouches are minimally processed to preserve nutrients and flavor, and you can just toss one in your bag and not worry that it will break or leak.”</br><p class=""p1""><strong>“SUCKING ON A POUCH CAN REALLY BACKFIRE.”</strong><br>“I have real concerns about this form of feeding,” asserts Karen Ansel, a New York—based registered dietitian. “Sucking on purees may breed eaters who are reluctant to chew food with more texture (like real fruits and vegetables). Plus, if parents are always offering a pouch at the first sign of hunger, kids may not develop the hunger and satiety cues that will help them learn not to overeat as they get older.”</br>"
 What's Missing From Your Child's Diet?,http://www.parenting.com/article/whats-missing-from-your-childs-diet,"Finding that magic assortment of foods seems harder than ever. The puzzle is more complicated and confusing, and there are a multitude of competing pieces -- like fast foods, high-sugar sweets, fat-laden snacks. The result is that these newfangled foods are leaving dietary gaps where the good stuff once was. Ironically, experts say, at the beginning of this high-tech century, our kids may actually be missing out on more nutrients than did children of the previous century. ""Nutritionally, progress is taking us backward. A hundred years ago children generally ate what was fresh and seasonal -- foods were unprocessed and natural,"" says John Monaco, M.D., director of Pediatric Intensive Care at Brandon Hospital in Tampa, FL, and coauthor of <i>Slim &amp; Fit Kids: Raising Healthy Children in a Fast Food World.</i> ""We point to our increased life expectancy as a sign that we're doing things better, but that has more to do with modern medicine than modern diets. We could improve our children's health and longevity even more if we fed them whole foods again.""According to a report by the National Cancer Institute, only 1 percent of children between ages 2 and 19 meet all the USDA Food Guide Pyramid recommendations for grains, vegetables, fruit, meats, and dairy. What's more, 16 percent meet none of the recommendations. It's no wonder then that we hear a steady drumbeat of warnings from health experts about nutrients that are missing-in-action from our kids' diets.So what's a parent to do? First, be aware that in many ways our food supply is distorted, full of new processed choices that kids find irresistible but that have little nutritional value (they don't call it ""junk"" food for nothing!). And be vigilant in limiting these dietary weaklings. Show your children the nutritional high road, but don't panic if they don't always take it. Even the best eaters hit a few bumps and detours now and then. ""Look at the big picture -- how they eat over several weeks, not just a few days,"" says Dr. Monaco.Finally, keep a few numbers in mind -- nutritional scores, if you will, of the amounts of vitamins and minerals that your child needs, plus where to find them. Here's the ledger on some of the most at-risk nutrients:The importance of calcium for growing bones should not be underestimated. ""A person can only build up the integrity of their bones with good nutrition until about age twenty. After that it's too late,"" says Carol Coughlin, a registered dietitian and author of <i>Good News About Good Food. </i>""That's why we say that osteoporosis is a pediatric disease with geriatric consequences."" For optimal bone growth, and healthy teeth and muscle function, children ages 4 to 8 need 800 mg of calcium daily; ages 9 to 14 need 1,200 mg daily.Best calcium sources:Best fiber sources:Good fats -- namely monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids -- are generally found in liquid vegetable oils like olive, corn, canola, and safflower oil. These fats supply the body with cellular building blocks as well as mechanisms to keep blood cholesterol levels down. Saturated fats -- the ""bad"" ones -- are found in meats, butter, lard, and other solid fats; they tend to raise cholesterol and fat levels in the blood.How much good fat a child needs depends on how many calories he consumes overall. Most health experts recommend that children get about 30 percent of calories from fat. So how does that translate into fat grams per day? The answer lies in a two quick calculations:Total calories x 0.30 (calories from fat) = recommended calories from fat per dayCalories from fat divided by 9 (the number of calories per fat gram) = grams of fat in foodsFor example, if a child eats 1,800 calories: 1,800 x 0.30 = 540 calories from fat; 540 (divided by) 9 = 60 grams of fat -- an amount you can look for on labels. For most preschoolers who burn about 1,200 calories per day, their fat gram quota would be 40; elementary-age kids who use 1,500 calories per day can afford 50 fat grams. That might sound like a lot, but the a typical fast-food lunch of a cheeseburger and small french fries racks up about 28 grams of fat -- and mostly the bad kind.However, a peanut-butter sandwich on whole-wheat bread with an apple and a 1/4 cup of raisins has only 11 grams of good fat (plus plenty of other healthy stuff like fiber, complex carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals). When considering fat, remember balance is best.Best zinc sources:"
 Pregnancy Diet: Eating (Well) for Two,http://www.parenting.com/article/pregnancy-diet,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekGood <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">nutrition</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> is most important during pregnancyEating right during your pregnancy prepares you for the rigors of labor, delivery, and, ultimately, motherhood, while also helping your baby develop during nine months of enormous change. ""Even with all the diagnostic tests and fancy equipment now available, good nutrition is still the most important factor in giving your baby a healthy start in life,"" says Bridget Swinney, M.S., R.D., author of <em>Eating Expectantly: A Practical and Tasty Guide to Prenatal Nutrition</em>.You're ahead of the game if you started eating well from the beginning of your pregnancy, but don't worry if you didn't mainline vegetables right after conception. What's important is that you focus on creating healthy eating habits as soon as you can.<strong><span class=""blue10b"">Food for Tot</span></strong> <br>Experts advise that you see a nutritionist during your pregnancy if you are significantly over- or underweight, a teenager, pregnant with multiples, or nursing while pregnant, because you may have special nutritional needs that can best be met by following a custom diet. ""Strict vegetarians should also consult with a dietitian,"" says Brenda Danner, R.D., C.D., outpatient dietitian at St. Francis Hospital and Health Center in Indianapolis, IN. ""Those who don't eat eggs or milk may lack vitamin B12 -- which is found only in animal products -- as well as iron, calcium, and other nutrients.""</br>For the majority of women, however, professional advice isn't necessary -- you just need to rethink your usual eating habits. Start by changing your definition of a meal. ""If you're used to a glass of juice as a morning meal,"" says Glade B. Curtis, M.D., a board certified ob-gyn who practices in Salt Lake City, UT, and author of <em>Your Pregnancy Week by Week</em>, ""make an effort to eat a real breakfast every day."" According to Dr. Curtis, a balanced diet of four or five small meals throughout the day is the best way to nourish your baby and maintain a high level of energy. (It will also help counter morning sickness; see next page.) It might sound like a lot of food, but you need the extra calories: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends pregnant women take in an additional 300 calories each day.But that doesn't mean chowing down on every high-calorie, high-fat treat in sight. To get the best results, go easy on fats, oils, and sweets, and stick to lean, low-fat, nutrition-packed foods. If you're unsure of just what to eat every day, here's a guideline:<em>Read ahead for pregnancy weight concerns</em><strong><span class=""blue10b""></span><span class=""blue10b"">Weighty Issues</span></strong> <br>In addition to providing nutrients and energy, all those calories will help you gain weight during pregnancy. The recommended gain for an average-size woman is 25 to 35 pounds. (Experts advise overweight women to stay in the lower end of the range, and underweight moms-to-be should aim for the higher end.)</br>While consciously putting on pounds is an unappetizing thought for many women, this is one time when you should cut yourself a break. ""It's not a time to be concerned about the weight,"" says Los Angeles-based Kathy Kaehler, fitness consultant for <a class=""vglnk"" href=""http://DietSmart.com"" rel=""nofollow""><span>DietSmart</span><span>.</span><span>com</span></a> and a mother of three. ""Focus on the fact that you are giving yourself and your baby quality nutrition, and let the weight do what it will.""Undereating or sticking to a weight-control diet while you are pregnant is not a wise choice. ""When you don't eat, your baby may not have the energy and nutrients it needs and will use up your own nutrient stores,"" says Swinney.But by the same token, don't feel like you can gain as much weight as you want; it won't just melt off after childbirth. ""Cut out the empty calories,"" says Danner. If you overdo it, she says, ""you're going to feel extra stress to shed those pounds later.""To accurately monitor your weight during pregnancy:<strong><span class=""blue10b"">Tummy Trouble</span></strong> <br>Nausea and morning sickness are likely to strike during the first three months of your pregnancy. ""Eating small meals five to six times a day can help,"" says Danner, since an empty stomach often triggers nausea, as can eating too much at one sitting. ""Drink fluids between meals, not with meals, to avoid extra movement in the stomach."" If morning is your queasiest time, ""eat a little something to jump-start the digestive process before you get out of bed,"" she adds. ""Keep crackers or pretzels by the bed. They help settle the stomach because they are low in fat and easy to digest.""</br>If your prenatal vitamin is making nausea worse, ""try taking it with meals or at night as opposed to first thing in the morning,"" says Dr. Curtis. If you really have trouble tolerating the supplement, he suggests talking to your doctor about alternatives -- like chewable prenatal vitamins -- but don't give up on getting these essential nutrients into your system.If you are vomiting often, ""eat whatever you can to get through it, and try to stay hydrated,"" says Swinney. ""Don't feel guilty that you're not eating a power-packed meal"" while you're sick, assures Dr. Curtis. Some foods that are usually well-tolerated during serious bouts of morning sickness include turkey or chicken breast, raw fruits, raw vegetables, juices, caffeine-free soda, skim milk, popsicles, Jell-O, Kool-Aid, pudding, yogurt, cereal, rice, and pasta. If you experience heartburn in the last trimester of pregnancy, drink plenty of fluids, keep active, and focus on consuming fiber-rich foods.<em>Read ahead for what not to eat during pregnancy</em><strong><span class=""blue10b""></span><span class=""blue10b"">To Eat or Not to Eat</span></strong> <br>Pregnant women should definitely steer clear of raw fish (it could contain harmful bacteria) and alcohol (which could lead to fetal alcohol syndrome). You should also avoid soft or mold-ripened cheeses (like Brie and Stilton) because of the risk of listeria, and raw eggs, which might contain salmonella. Talk to your doctor about caffeine, which a recent study has linked to an increased risk of miscarriage.</br>As for concerns about the danger of pesticides, Danner recommends giving fresh produce a good 20- to 30-second wash with warm water to remove dirt, germs, and any trace amounts of pesticide residue. If you're really worried, you can always go organic, but most experts say that produce from your local grocery store is just fine.

 Ask Dr. Sears: Is Vitamin Water Safe for Kids?,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-is-vitamin-water-safe-for-kids,"<strong>Q. My 2½-year-old daughter recently asked to try my vitamin water (she liked it and said it ""tasted like Jell-O!""). While I never give her soda or <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">foods</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> with artificial sweeteners, I don't see much harm in letting her have some of this vitamin-enriched water. Are there any pediatric concerns regarding these drinks?</strong> <br><br><strong>A.</strong> The bottom line: Don't waste your money on vitamin water. You're better off serving your child plain bottled water and letting her get vitamins from healthy foods and/or a daily multivitamin. Here's why: <br><br><strong>Vitamins in the water may not be as nutritious as the vitamins in food.</strong> My main concern is that, biochemically, the vitamins in the water may behave differently in the body than vitamins that naturally occur in foods from nature, such as apples or broccoli. Due to a biochemical quirk called synergy, when a food's vitamins and minerals are packaged together, they help one another absorb into the bloodstream more efficiently and function better throughout the body. When, for example, vitamins C and E are eaten together in a food, such as a green leafy vegetable like spinach, the health effect on the body is much greater than when the vitamins are consumed individually as, say, vitamin C in vitamin water. In short, food gives you the whole package of nutrients. Vitamin water gives just a few vitamins and may not be nearly as effective the same ones eaten in foods.<br><br><strong>Let water be water.</strong> One of the most important nutritional principles in childhood health is to shape young tastes. You don't want your child to grow up thinking that drinks should ""taste like Jell-O""  -- in other words that every drink must be colored, flavored, or sweetened. Rather, you want her to develop a taste for plain water. Start now to instill in her the belief that water is a healthy  -- and preferable  -- drink.<br><br><strong>Vitamin water may not be as healthy as you think.</strong> While I don't know which brand of water you drink, I can assume that if it tastes like Jell-O to your child, it's artificially colored and/or sweetened, both of which could be harmful to your child's health. In my opinion, artificial food colorings (such as red #40) have never been proven safe for growing children. In fact, the government categorizes them as GRAS (generally regarded as safe). This translates to: ""We're really not sure!"" Try to restrict not only artificially sweetened beverages but those sweetened with sugar or high fructose corn syrup as well. Researchers believe these beverages are the top cause of childhood obesity in America. In addition, studies have shown that gulping down sweetened beverages can depress the body's immune system, just the opposite of what you hope to achieve from consuming vitamins. <br><br>I'm also concerned that vitamin water may harm the teeth. Medical journals have recently published warnings about acidic beverages eroding dental enamel. Vitamin C (chemically known as asorbic acid), which is generally one of the vitamins added to vitamin water, is acidic, while plain water is not. Another safety concern is the ""drug interactions"" that could potentially occur among the ingredients in these so-called smart beverages. The combination of all these herbs and vitamins have, most likely, never been studied in children. We know that nature safely combines nutrients in fruits and vegetables, but we don't know the safety of combinations put together in a laboratory and then added to a bottle of water. Many nutritionists believe that vitamin water is simply a gimmick, and I tend to agree.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>"

No problem. With good planning, vegetarians can easily meet nutritional requirements while pregnant and nursing. ""It's the nutritive <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">quality</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> of a mother's foods, not the original source of each nutrient, that makes the difference in a baby's health,"" says Holly Roberts, M.D., a San Francisco-based ob/gyn and author of <i>Your Vegetarian Pregnancy</i>. Assess your diet to make sure you're meeting the recommended dietary allowances (ask your doctor for a list or find them in Roberts's book). The steps below can help you overcome some common challenges:<b>Mix it up.</b> Vary foods daily so that trace minerals and nutrients you don't consume one day will be consumed later that week.<b>Take prenatal vitamins.</b> Supplements help pick up the slack where your diet falls short, says Roberts. Ask your health care provider whether you also need to take a calcium supplement to help you meet the recommended 1,200 milligrams (mg) per day, particularly if you don't eat dairy.<b>Pump up your iron.</b> A mother transfers a total of up to 1,000 mg of iron to her baby during pregnancy, which could cause her to develop iron-deficiency anemia, a condition characterized by fatigue. Although red meat is the most commonly known source, it's not the only way to get the mineral. Increase daily intake to 30 mg by eating foods like lentils, spinach, chickpeas, pumpkin, and almonds. Your doctor will perform a blood test to see if you need supplements beyond the iron you're getting in your prenatal vitamin.<b>B aggressive.</b> B vitamins are vital to moms. One of the most critical in this group is folic acid, which helps prevent neural tube defects when it's taken in the earliest weeks of pregnancy (so start taking prenatal vitamins when you're trying to conceive). Most pregnant women need a total of 600 micrograms (mcg) of folate (400 mcg from a supplement and 200 mcg from foods) -- though some doctors may recommend more for vegetarians. Good sources of folate include beans, nuts, greens, and fortified breads and cereals. Vegans, in particular, are at risk for deficiencies of B12, a.k.a. cobalamin, because they don't eat meat, dairy, or eggs, the most common sources of the vitamin. The Centers for Disease Control recently warned that maternal deficiencies of B12 can cause developmental delays in infants. It recommends a supplement of 2.6 mcg during pregnancy and 2.8 mcg while nursing.<b>Pack in the protein.</b> Protein is essential for building your baby's bones and tissues during pregnancy, as well as helping you produce breast milk postpartum. Eat larger amounts of such protein-rich foods as eggs, yogurt, and milk (if you include dairy in your diet), as well as beans, nuts, and tofu to get the recommended 60 grams per day during pregnancy and 65 grams while nursing. It's not a huge hurdle if you consider that one cup of firm tofu has 40 grams of protein.<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=81571858&amp;src=id"">Shutterstock Image</a>"
 Ask Dr. Sears: Dieting Questions,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-dieting-questions,"<span class=""green16b"">Q</span> <span class=""green10""><strong>Is it okay to diet while breastfeeding? Can I at least reduce carbs?</strong></span><span class=""grey16b""><strong>A:</strong></span> <span class=""grey10"">When you breastfeed, those extra pounds melt away without drastic dieting. You may be happy to know that compared to formula-feeding mothers, breastfeeding moms show more fat loss by one month postpartum and tend to loose more weight from three to six months postpartum. Even though breastfeeding mothers consume more calories, the energy used in making milk uses up some extra fat stores. In fact, to produce enough milk for your baby you use up an extra 500 calories a day. If these weight-loss benefits of breastfeeding are not enough, it <em>is</em> safe to diet, as long as you make sure you and your baby receive proper nourishment. You should not lose more than a pound a week. Here are some ways to lose weight safely: </span><span class=""grey10""><strong>Exercise a lot.</strong> In my experience with postpartum weight loss, dieting without exercise rarely keeps the weight off and may deprive you and your new baby of needed nutrients. Crash diets and fad diets often lead to water and muscle loss instead of fat loss, while exercise burns fat and increases your basal metabolic rate (BMR). To burn an extra 300 calories a day, put your baby in a carrier and take a brisk walk for at least an hour every day. Put on some music and dance while you hold your baby in your arms or in a sling, or if you prefer the atmosphere of a gym or a day spa, reserve this as a special outing just for you. With postpartum exercise you can enjoy a couple of extra perks: Exercise produces the body's natural ""feel-good hormones"" called endorphins, which lessen the severity of postpartum depression, and exercise also elevates production of the milk-making hormone, prolactin. </span><span class=""grey10""><strong>Eat the right food rather than less food.</strong> Go through your present diet and figure out how you can whittle away 200 calories a day of junk food. This would be the equivalent of two chocolate-chip cookies. Eat nutrient-dense foods such as fresh fruits, whole grain cereals, wild rice, non-fat yogurt, non-fat cottage cheese, white-meat chicken or turkey (without skin), salmon, tuna, sweet potatoes, all vegetables, and legumes. Avoid calorie-dense foods like high-fat, high-sugar, packaged foods. I advise all postpartum mothers: Don't go down the aisle in the supermarket that sells package goods (which should be called ""packaged bads"") like chips, cookies, and snack foods high in junk carbs and unhealthy fats. And stay away from anything with the word ""hydrogenated"" on the label. </span><span class=""grey10""></span><span class=""grey10""><strong>Fill up with fiber.</strong> Fiber is calorie-free and filling, and, as an added perk, fiber prevents constipation, which is common during postpartum recovery. Fiber-rich foods are also high in complex carbohydrates, which don't give you the roller coaster effect of blood sugar swings. Foods high in fiber are: whole grain cereals, flaxmeal, apples, prunes, lentils, kidney beans, pears, chickpeas, bran, and sweet potatoes. </span><span class=""grey10""><strong>Eat a right-fat diet rather than a low-fat diet.</strong> Little growing brains need fat. Since your baby gets fat from your breast milk, the last thing you want to do during breastfeeding is not eat enough fat. The best fats for making nourishing milk and losing weight are the omega-3's found in fatty fish (such as salmon and tuna), flax oil, and canola oil. Avoid as much animal fat as possible and certainly avoid any fats that are listed as ""hydrogenated"" on the label. </span><span class=""grey10""><strong>Eat a right-carbohydrate diet rather than a low-carbohydrate diet.</strong> At least 50 percent of your daily diet should be in the form of complex carbohydrates -- whole grains, fruits, and vegetables -- which are the best sources of energy. Reduce your intake of fiberless carbohydrates, those found in frostings, sodas, and junk juices (juice drinks full of corn syrup). The above tips will not only help you loose a lot of unwanted fat, they will also help you feel good in the process.</span>"
 Ask Dr. Sears: Homemade Baby Food Causing Gas?,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-homemade-baby-food-causing-gas,"<strong>Q. We make all of our baby's <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">food</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> from scratch, but he seems to have a lot of gas. Could this gassiness be caused by the homemade baby food, and if so, are there certain foods we should avoid to alleviate the problem?<br><br>A. </br></br></strong>I applaud you for making your own baby food. It's a lot better for your baby than anything you could buy, and it's most likely not the cause of his gassiness. Aside from the nutritional benefits, how you feed your baby now is going to shape his tastes later on. Remember this principle, and you'll give your child a real health advantage for the rest of her life.Let's go over this important concept first, and then I'll give you a list of suggestions for making mealtimes more intestine-friendly.Feeding your baby homemade solids accustoms his taste buds and gut to fresh, wholesome food, while also programming your child's tastes to the healthy adult foods typical of your family's cuisine. Similarly, if your baby grows up on canned or jarred foods, his body will learn that this is what food is supposed to taste like, and so, later on, he will be more likely to choose processed items over fresh.Years ago, I had a group of moms in my pediatric practice that I dubbed the ""pure moms."" They never let a single morsel of packaged food enter the mouths of their kids. Monitoring these children as they got older, I noticed that they were not only much healthier than average, but also that they tended to not overdose on junk food and, in fact, many of them would actively shun junk and packaged foods. Because their developing tastes and intestines had been programmed to the tastes of real foods, they had made the connection: ""I eat good, and I feel good.""So, please do keep making your own baby food, and follow the tips below to help ease your baby's gassy belly.<strong>Feed twice as often, half as much.</strong> Smaller, more frequent feedings is one of the best remedies for gassy babies, and here's why: It's not the food itself that causes gas, but the quantity of food at one feeding. Remember, your baby's tummy is only about the size of his fist. If babies take in more than that amount, the undigested food ferments in the lower intestines, producing gas.<strong>Serve the least allergenic foods.</strong> Begin your baby on the solid foods that are least likely to cause an allergic reaction, such as avocados, carrots, squash, pears, applesauce, apricots, broccoli, rice, sweet potatoes, and papayas. Foods that are more likely to be allergenic are: berries, citrus fruits, corn, cow's milk, egg whites, nuts, peanut butter, soy, tomatoes, wheat, and yeast.<strong>Make every calorie count.</strong> Nutrient-dense foods that pack a lot of nutrition in a small volume will be much friendlier to tiny tummies. Once you've determined (by trial and error) that your child is not allergic to any of the following foods, you should make them a major part of his diet. The most nutrient-dense foods recommended for toddlers are: avocados, eggs, cheese, seafood (preferably wild salmon), kidney beans, yogurt, peanut butter, sweet potatoes, tofu, and whole grains.<strong>Avoid constipation.</strong> A common, but often hidden cause of gassiness is chronic constipation. The longer food waste stays in the intestines, the more likely it is to ferment and produce gas. So, give your child lots of fluids to keep his digestive tract moving smoothly. Aim for about one ounce per pound of body weight per day. Also, encourage your child to nibble or graze on food throughout the day (again, small amounts rather than big meals); this eating pattern should help prevent blockages."
 The Poop On...,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-poop-on,"<b>Green Stool</b> <br>""This isn't something to worry about,"" says Judith Sondheimer, M.D., of the Children's Hospital, in Denver. Certain foods, such as soy-based formulas, can cause green stool, as will antibiotics.</br><b>Multicolored Stool or Food Particles</b> <br>Strained carrots and squash can produce orange stool. And while it's not uncommon for toddlers to pass whole raisins or pieces of corn, this doesn't mean a child's body feels discomfort or isn't absorbing nutrients.</br><b>Sandy-Looking Stool</b> <br>Most common in babies who are eating solids, such stool is often due to high-fiber foods, like oats and fruit. A sandy, sticky consistency could also indicate mild constipation; if so, your pediatrician can advise you on how to ease the problem by making changes in the baby's diet.</br><b>""Seeded"" Stool</b> <br>In toddlers, seeds from foods such as tomatoes, raspberries, and watermelon will pass painlessly out of the body whole.</br>While the above variations are harmless, if you notice the following, save the stool in the diaper and call your pediatrician immediately:"
 When Your Child Can't Digest Bread,http://www.parenting.com/article/when-your-child-cant-digest-bread,"<b>It's rare.</b> Far from it: As many as 1 in 100 has it. That's about 30 times more common than has been previously thought.<b>Babies outgrow it.</b> Not true, though many doctors are only just recognizing this as a myth. Often, it first appears when babies start on cereals. Classic symptoms  -- cramping, gas, and diarrhea  -- may subside, but if the disease goes untreated, it can be very harmful.<b>It only causes an allergic reaction.</b> Because a child with celiac sprue can't absorb nutrients properly, her growth may suffer, puberty can be delayed, and neurological problems can surface. (If undiagnosed until adulthood, it can lead to anemia, even infertility.)<b>It's incurable.</b> True, but it's quite treatable. A gluten-free diet makes symptoms disappear, usually within a few weeks, and often allows the body to repair itself.<b>It's hard to eat that way.</b> Yes, it's tough to skip regular pasta, pizza, and bread, but gluten-free alternatives are available in health-food stores and supermarkets and on the Internet  -- and rice is fine.If your child is smaller than average or is losing weight even though she's eating normally, talk to your pediatrician about testing her for celiac sprue. New diagnostic tools make pinpointing it easier than ever. If the test is positive, you should be checked too  -- celiac sprue runs in the family and can be silent for decades."

I've just discovered this awesome new tummy soothing, feel-better beverage called B.R.A.T.  No, they didn't name it after your kid; the name comes from the classic ""BRAT"" diet recommended by pediatricians for decades to calm all sorts of digestive discomfort. BRAT is an acronym for bananas, rice, applesauce, toast.This tasty organic drink contains all those nutrients, except for the toast because the seriously smart parents who invented it wanted it to be okay for kids with allergies, too. It's got all the good stuff upset tummies need—hydrating electrolytes, vitamin D, calcium—and none of the bad: no added sugar, no dairy, soy, corn, casein or gluten. And it's a creamy, soothing, milk-like blend that comes in vanilla, chocolate honey, and cinnamon toast, as well as the original flavor. I taste-tested all four and every one is absolutely yummy, especially chilled, and natural tasting. A 32-oz. container costs about the same as traditional electrolyte solutions. It's also available in grocery stores nationwide (go to <a href=""http://www.bratdietdrink.com/"">BratDietDrink.com</a> for specific locations) and on <a class=""vglnk"" href=""http://Amazon.com"" rel=""nofollow""><span>Amazon</span><span>.</span><span>com</span></a>.

 Taking Care Of Preemie Teeth,http://www.parenting.com/article/taking-care-of-preemie-teeth,"When the <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">teeth</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> of babies who are born prematurely come in, they may lack protective enamel and be more prone to decay and staining. The more premature the infant, the more likely she is to have this condition, which is known as enamel hypoplasia.Teeth are fully formed under the gums at birth, and the enamel on one or more teeth can become damaged when lifesaving respirator tubes press against gums for prolonged periods. In 40 to 70 percent of cases, the hypoplasia is due to illnesses, or insufficient calcium from feeding problems or difficulty absorbing nutrients.Parents can head off a variety of enamel decay-related problems  -- such as cavities and damage to adult teeth that are forming below the gums  -- by taking their infant to the dentist within six months of her first tooth eruption, and no later than age 1, according to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. Although this recommendation applies to all kids, ""for children born prematurely, it can be particularly important,"" says Carrie Havelka, D.D.S., a pediatric dentist at Boston's Children's Hospital and the mother of 3-year-old twins who were born preterm.For kids who are especially cavity-prone, a dentist can ""paint"" a white plastic material over affected baby teeth to help protect them from further decay and to fill in any cosmetic imperfections.Just as important as dental visits is a bedtime routine of cleaning your baby's teeth and gums with an age-appropriate toothbrush and a small amount of toothpaste. ""This helps remove decay-causing material,"" says Dr. Havelka, ""and also gets the child used to having something in her mouth, readying her for brushing her teeth on her own later on."""
 Banish Post-Baby Blues,http://www.parenting.com/article/banish-post-baby-blues,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekWhile pregnant, you dutifully loaded up on folate to reduce the risk of neural-tube defects in your newborn, but now research says there's just as much reason to keep supplementing with the nutrient even after the baby arrives.A new study from Tufts University in Boston shows that folate may play a critical role in staving off postpartum depression. Researchers looked at folate concentrations in nearly 3,000 people and found that those with major depression had lower levels of folate in their bloodstream than those who had never been depressed. Longer-lasting, mild depression (dysthymia) was also associated with low folate levels.""Folate plays an important role in brain function,"" explains Martha Morris, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at Tufts University Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging. ""Low levels of it result in symptoms that can mimic major depression -- including fatigue, difficulty learning, loss of energy, and changes in appetite -- so what looks like depression could actually be a folate deficiency.""Studies show that supplementation with 400 to 500 micrograms of folate a day improves these depressive symptoms and can even make antidepressants work better.So if you're among the 70 to 80 percent of women who feel tired, irritable, and inadequate after childbirth (the baby blues), Morris recommends having a physician check your folate levels. And if you're interested in getting more folate in your diet as a potential mood booster, turn to whole-wheat breads, cereals, rice, and pastas. Thanks to a government mandate requiring folate fortification of all enriched grain products, Americans are already getting an additional 200 micrograms of folic acid daily. Other foods naturally rich in folate include spinach, asparagus, lentils, and beans. You can also continue to take your prenatal vitamins post-baby (many doctors recommend this anyway, especially if you're breastfeeding); that way, you can be sure you're getting the folate you need."
 How to Quell Morning Sickness,http://www.parenting.com/article/how-to-quell-morning-sickness,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekIf you're always feeling <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">ill</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>, perhaps this will be comforting: Morning sickness may actually be beneficial.Nausea and vomiting may help protect both mother and fetus from food containing harmful chemicals and organisms, according to a study from Cornell University. In fact, researchers found that nearly 65,000 women who suffered from morning sickness had fewer miscarriages as well as a greater chance of giving birth to healthy babies.If that alone doesn't make you feel better, some proven ways to help:<strong>Stay out of the kitchen.</strong> The hormone surges of early pregnancy often cause women to have extra-sensitive noses. Let someone else cook, or order takeout.<strong>Eat often.</strong> An empty stomach will only make you feel worse. And if you crave it, eat it, say experts, even if that means a grilled cheese sandwich for every meal. (Don't worry about getting a balanced diet, but do take prenatal vitamins, which will compensate for any nutrients you lose during this stage.)<strong>Go alternative.</strong> The American Medical Association has approved acupuncture (often covered by insurance) as a means of treating pregnancy nausea. Another option: Bio-Bands, acupressure bracelets often used to ease motion sickness (available at most drugstores). Both methods can provide short-term relief.<strong>Drink up.</strong> It's important to consume ten cups of fluids a day. If that's difficult, try alternating water or juice with watermelon cubes (they yield about half a cup of liquid per cup consumed), ice pops, or ice chips.If you can't keep down any liquid, even water, and you begin to lose weight, call your doctor right away. This may be a sign of hyperemesis gravidarum, severe nausea and vomiting that affect about two percent of pregnant women and can lead to dehydration and malnutrition."
" Oh, Sugar!",http://www.parenting.com/article/oh-sugar,"Most <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">kids</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> get more than their fair share of sweets, so it's not surprising that a recent study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that, on average, preschoolers eat 15 teaspoons of added sweeteners (such as sugar, honey, or fructose) a day -- that's 9 teaspoons more than they should.The main sources of these sweeteners in their diets: soda, fruit drinks, cookies, and candy, says Joanne Guthrie, Ph.D., lead author of the study.Nutritionists warn that too much sugar can lead to cavities and obesity, and possibly increase the risk of heart disease. Plus, sweets usually contain few vitamins or minerals -- and may diminish a child's appetite for more nutritious foods. Some ways to cut back on them:<strong>SHOP SMART</strong> Added sweeteners come in a variety of forms -- sugar, sucrose, corn syrup, honey, maltose, dextrose, and fructose. If any of these is one of the top three ingredients on a food label, pass up the item or serve it sparingly.<strong>OPT FOR FRUIT JUICE</strong> Fruit and sports drinks often pack in more added sugars and have fewer nutrients than 100-percent juices. Save soda as a special treat, and encourage your kids to drink milk or water with their meals.<strong>DON'T BE FOOLED BY LOW-FAT FOODS</strong> Some contain more sugar to fill in for the fat. While you may still want to offer fat-reduced cookies, cakes, and granola bars, alternate them with healthier snacks like fruit, pretzels, and string cheese. Artificial sweeteners, such as saccharin or aspartame, also aren't necessarily a better bet. Although low in calories, they're usually found in nutritionally empty desserts and can help foster a sweet tooth.<strong>SWEETEN TREATS YOURSELF</strong> Rather than buying a fruit yogurt, add a mashed banana and a teaspoon of table sugar to plain yogurt; instead of cookies or breakfast bars, toast a slice of whole-wheat bread and top it with a little honey or jam, or a pat of butter and cinnamon and sugar."

Let rest under foil for at least 5 minutes and then cut into strips. Set aside. Heat sauté pan with olive oil. Once hot, cook cherry tomatoes until they burst. (Cooked this way, the tomatoes have an extremely buttery taste.) Add red onion and sauté until golden in color. Add the mushrooms and sauté for about 3-5 minutes. Add fresh basil, salt and pepper, chicken broth and milk. Bring to a low boil then immediately dial back to a simmer. Let the flavors develop and the sauce reduce to about half, approximately 10-15 minutes.  In the meantime, boil water and cook spinach fettuccine. When pasta is about half done, add the spinach, chicken and parmesan cheese to the sauce. Let the spinach cook and the chicken soak up the flavors for a few minutes until the pasta is cooked. When cooked, add pasta to sauce and let sit for about 5 minutes. Cook and enjoy! You have a creamy, delicious pasta packed with calcium, antioxidants, vitamins, protein, iron and everything you and your baby need!"

 Safest Sleep Positions During Pregnancy,http://www.parenting.com/article/safest-sleep-positions-during-pregnancy,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekNow that you're pregnant, what are the safest positions to <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">sleep</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> in for you and baby? Read ahead to find outWhen you're pregnant, <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/project-pregnancy/jenny-feldon/pillow-talk"">getting comfortable at night</a> is no easy feat. After all, your back is aching, your legs are cramping, and your belly is threatening to take over the bed. On top of all that, you can add yet another nighttime inconvenience: figuring out which position is the safest for sleeping.For obvious reasons, sleeping on your stomach isn't a good idea after the fifth month of pregnancy. And it's so uncomfortable that most women stop doing it much earlier, says Vera Stucky, M.D., an obstetrician at the University of California, San Diego Medical Center.But sleeping flat on your back isn't the answer, either: Experts generally advise women to avoid this position after about the 16th week. ""If you sleep on your back, the enlarged uterus presses against the inferior vena cava, the vein that returns blood from the lower body to the heart,"" Stucky explains. This can cause low blood pressure, exacerbate existing kidney conditions and hypertension, and contribute to the development of hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and edema.In rare cases, sleeping on your back can even prevent the baby from getting all of the oxygen and nutrients it needs. Usually, however, the symptoms of low blood pressure—nausea, shortness of breath, dizziness, and clamminess—will rouse a snoozing mom-to-be long before her fetus is endangered. And nature itself may provide a second line of defense. ""If the baby gets uncomfortable, it will start kicking and wake up the mother so she can change position,"" says George Verrilli, M.D., an obstetrician in private practice in Rhinebeck, NY.So how should you get those precious zzz's? The safest bet is to lie on your side—preferably your left side, which allows for maximum blood flow—the next time sleep beckons. And if you wake up in the ""wrong"" position, simply roll over and dream of the day when that maneuver won't be a major undertaking."

What's normal?</strong><strong>A.</strong> How about we start with what's not normal?* <strong>Blood in stool</strong> (Note: Blood can look black and tarry as well as red)* <strong>Hard, small stools</strong> accompanied by pain, which can mean constipation* <strong>Watery or mucus-y stools</strong> more than eight times a day  -- either one could signal infection* <strong>Pale or chalk-colored stools</strong> (while rare, this can be a sign of a liver problem)* <strong>Stools that consistently look oily or greasy</strong>, which can indicate a problem with nutrient absorptionIf you see any of these signs, or if your baby has a change in her bowel movements that's accompanied by fever, vomiting, or what seems to be pain (especially a tummy ache), you should check in with your pediatrician.Pretty much anything else you see in her diaper, though, is fine. Once the greenish-black meconium has passed through a newborn's intestine  -- this usually takes a few days  -- baby poop <em>will</em> vary widely in color and consistency, depending on what you've been feeding your child. Exclusively breastfed babies, for example, tend to have mustard-colored, sometimes greenish, seedy stools, though the exact color can change with the mother's diet. In general, breastfed babies have looser bowel movements than formula-fed babies  -- who usually have browner, more formed stools  -- because breast milk is digested more quickly and easily than formula. But there can be individual differences, too.Once babies get started on solids and juice, their bowel movements become even more formed (and foul smelling), and will sometimes take on the color of whatever they've been eating or drinking. Case in point: I recently saw a baby who had bright-pink poops in his diaper from fruit punch!"

 Mom Drinks Her Own Breast Milk to Survive in the Wild,http://www.parenting.com/news-break/mom-drinks-her-own-breast-milk-to-survive-wild,"When the mom became lost in the wilderness, her breast <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">milk</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> helped keep her alive.<a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T8iqI2FDhq0"" target=""_blank"">YouTube</a>New Zealand mom Susan O'Brien had some runners' gel packs, an energy bar and two liters of water with her when she got lost while running a 20-kilometer race in Rimutaka Forest Park. But, she credits drinking her own breast milk with giving her necessary nutrients during the overnight ordeal.""I got lost and got stuck in some bushes, and then I thought that was it,"" <a href=""http://www.radionz.co.nz/news/regional/273290/missing-mum-drank-breast-milk"">Susan told reporters</a>. ""I wanted to carry on, but I got too exhausted, so I just dug a hole. I didn't have a life blanket. I thought I was going to die.""It was cold, and Susan, who's a breastfeeding mom, wanted to regain her energy, so she expressed some of her milk to drink while she was stranded. She dug a hole to sleep in and placed dirt on top of herself to keep warm.The next day, Susan was found and returned happily to her family.So, can drinking your own breast milk really help in a survival situation? Yes, but only in the short term, Mary Jane Minkin, OB-GYN and clinical professor at the Yale School of Medicine, <a href=""http://www.womenshealthmag.com/health/woman-drinks-breast-milk-to-survive-in-the-wild"" target=""_blank"">tells Women's Health</a>. The calories in the breast milk can definitely keep your energy levels up, and of course, it's a totally safe <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/sasha-parentingcom/man-goes-all-breast-milk-diet"">drink to consume</a> (and it's clean, as long as you find the right container!).

 Nighttime Nursing,http://www.parenting.com/article/nighttime-nursing,"""It's natural for infants who nurse to want to eat more frequently,"" says Lawrence Gartner, M.D., chair of the executive committee section on breastfeeding for the American Academy of Pediatrics. Your own milk is relatively low in fat and protein, so it's digested more easily than formula. That means it passes through your infant's stomach a little faster -- so she feels hungry sooner.A breastfed baby may also ingest a little less at each feeding than a formula-fed baby. Every time you nurse, your milk changes from a thin liquid to a thicker, slightly higher-fat substance. Your infant may feel satisfied -- and stop suckling -- shortly after that more-filling milk starts to flow. (Not to worry: She's most likely getting plenty to eat.)Frequent night nursings can be pretty rough on you, but they're actually a good thing, especially in the first six months. They provide your baby with the nutrients she needs to stay healthy, help keep your milk supply from dwindling, and prevent your breasts from becoming engorged. In fact, if you try to make a ravenous baby wait to eat, she'll probably just get fussier and may not be able to settle down for a good meal.You <i>can</i> try to make sure she goes back to sleep quickly: Don't turn on the lights, don't play with her, and forgo a diaper change unless she's soaked or uncomfortable. By the time she's 8 or 9 months old, she'll start to give up most of those wee-hour feedings."
 Solids: The Right Time to Start?,http://www.parenting.com/article/solids-the-right-time-to-start-21354774,"It's best to introduce solid foods when your baby's between 4 and 6 months, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. In some cases, it's okay to begin a little later (some babies may not be developmentally ready until 7 months), but starting sooner is definitely not a <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">good</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> idea. Here's why:<strong>It'll backfire.</strong> Babies are born with a reflex that makes them push their tongue forward when something touches it  -- which means they can't use the tongue to move food from the front to the back of the mouth. If you try to push the food into your baby's mouth, he may start to gag, which certainly isn't going to make his first experience with solids a pleasant one. Between 4 and 6 months, this reflex disappears.<strong>He may develop a food allergy.</strong> ""The gut is much more permeable before four months, so whole proteins can be absorbed easily, which increases the risk of developing an allergy,"" says William Dietz, M.D., director of the division of nutrition and physical activity at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta.<strong>He doesn't need it.</strong> Up until about 6 months, breastmilk or formula provides all the nutrition he requires. After that, he'll start to need certain nutrients from solid foods. He also should get additional calories  -- how many varies from baby to baby. On average, by the time he's 1, he may take in about 400 extra calories from solids; 600 by age 2.<strong>He could acquire long-term health problems.</strong> In one study, infants fed cereal before 3 months old had a higher risk of developing celiac disease (a serious intolerance of wheat protein) than those who were fed cereal between 4 and 6 months. Studies also suggest that babies given cereal before 3 months (and, possibly, after 7 months for the first time (are at greater risk for diabetes)."
 What to Eat to Conceive,http://www.parenting.com/article/what-eat-conceive,"From baby carrots to pineapple, we ask the experts to weigh in on which foods boost fertility—during every phase of your <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">cycle</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>.<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=129748976&amp;src=id"" target=""_blank"">shutterstock</a>You’re already loading up on organic fruits and veggies, staying away from processed foods and making sure you get enough whole grains, lean protein and dairy into your diet, as well as taking a prenatal vitamin for insurance. But can eating certain foods during different phases of your cycle enhance your fertility? Some experts say yes!“Different phases of the cycle require a woman’s body to produce different hormones and go through separate processes,” says Jill Blakeway, M.S., L.A.c., clinic director at <a href=""https://yinovacenter.com/"">The YinOva Center</a> in New York and co-author of <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Making-Babies-3-Month-Program-Fertility/dp/0316024503/"">Making Babies: A Proven 3-Month Program for Maximum Fertility</a></em>. “So if a woman wants to maximize her chances of conceiving, it is possible to eat foods that are advantageous to each phase.”But since many pre-conception eating recommendations are nothing more than wild Internet rumors, we asked the experts to weigh in on what to eat during each of the four reproductive phases. Want the scoop? Read on.<span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">When your period starts to flow, you may feel crampy, bloated, fatigued and moody. You may also be depleting your iron stores. In fact, the average woman loses 30-40 milliliters of blood over the course of three to seven days. “Iron is attached to the red blood cells, so the way you lose it is by bleeding,” says Elizabeth Ward, M.S., R.D., a Boston-area nutrition consultant and author of </span><em style=""line-height: 1.6;""><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Expect-Best-Pregnancy-American-Association/dp/0470290765/"">Expect the Best: Your Guide to Healthy Eating Before, During and After Pregnancy</a></em><span style=""line-height: 1.6;""> (Wiley 2009).</span>Menstruation is a good time to remember to focus on foods rich in iron, which the <a href=""http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/DietaryGuidelines/2010/PolicyDoc/Chapter4.pdf"">Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010</a> names as a nutrient of real concern among women in their childbearing years. Just don’t view your period as an excuse to load up on double cheeseburgers. “It’s understandable for women who have a failed cycle to indulge—just don’t linger in that place,” says Hillary M. Wright, MEd, RD, LDN, director of nutrition counseling for the <a href=""http://www.domarcenter.com/"">Domar Center for Mind/Body Health</a> at Boston IVF and author of <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/PCOS-Diet-Plan-Approach-Polycystic/dp/158761023X/"">The PCOS Diet Plan: A Natural Approach to Health for Women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome</a></em>. “Have an episode, then try to regroup and get back to setting the stage for a successful pregnancy.”Meat, beans, fish, leafy green vegetables and seeds. Most of these foods are rich in iron, protein or both, which is especially important if you have endometriosis or bleed heavily. And some (like fish, seeds and leafy greens) have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help mitigate cramps by encouraging healthy blood flow. Another tip: eat plenty of bell peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, kiwi, citrus and other food sources that are high in vitamin C. “Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron from beans, whole grains and fortified cereals,” says Ward.Cold foods (if your periods are clotted and painful) and alcohol, caffeine and spicy foods, which can make bleeding even heavier.Steak fajitas with black beans, bell peppers, onions and tomato salsa.<span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">During the follicular phase, your body is working hard to develop a dominant follicle and estrogen levels are on the rise. Unfortunately, women who are struggling with fibroids and endometriosis often have too much estrogen (a condition called estrogen dominance). “Cruciferous veggies like broccoli, kale, cabbage and cauliflower contain a phytonutrient called di-indolylmethane (DIM), which can help women metabolize estrogen better,” says Blakeway. In fact, DIM binds to environmental estrogens like pesticides and hormones in meat and dairy products, helping rid the body of excess estrogen. Just don’t forget to have some olive oil, avocado, nuts and seeds with those leafy greens. These foods are loaded with vitamin E, which is found in the fluid of the follicle that’s housing your egg.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">As you near ovulation, the body needs plenty of B vitamins and other nutrients to support the release of the egg and promote implantation. “Zinc can help with cell division and progesterone production and vitamin C is found in high quantities in the follicle after the egg is released and may play a role in progesterone production as well,” says Blakeway.</span>Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are also crucial during this phase. The best source: omega-3s from fish and fish oil supplements. These EFAs are best known for promoting blood flow to the uterus and supporting the opening of the follicle to release the egg, but guess what? They also open up the tiny blood vessels in your nether regions, which can ensure you’re primed and ready for action. “Fish oil thins out your blood and increases circulation to your body parts,” says Wright. Plus, fish oil boosts the testosterone in your body—yes, women have this hormone too—so you may become aroused more quickly. And who among us couldn’t use a little of that when entering the O-zone?<span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Now is the time to load up on nutrients that encourage cell growth. Beta-carotene, which is commonly found in leafy greens as well as yellow and orange foods (e.g., carrots, cantaloupe and sweet potatoes), helps keep your hormones in check and prevents early miscarriage. In fact, the corpus luteum, which helps produce the progesterone necessary to sustain a pregnancy, is loaded with the powerful nutrient.</span>One food that gets a lot of attention during this phase is pineapple. In addition to beta-carotene, pineapple contains a substance called bromelain, which has been shown to mildly support implantation through its anti-inflammatory properties. “There’s not a lot of research out there for the benefits of eating pineapple during the time of conception, but if you want to hedge your bets, you may benefit,” says Wright. “After all, pineapple is a healthy food with no downside.” Experts discourage taking bromelain as a supplement though because the dose may be too high, and anything that dramatically moves blood during this time could be counter-productive. <span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Think you may be pregnant alrea</span><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">dy?

Avoid simple carbohydrates -- found in white sugar, white flour, and the foods that contain them (cakes, white bread) -- because they are nutritionally empty and fattening.<br><strong>Where:</strong> You'll need a whopping nine servings a day, which might come from: 1 slice whole wheat bread, 1 tortilla, 1/2 bagel, 1 ounce cold cereal, 1/2 cup cooked pasta or rice, 1 medium potato, 1/2 cup corn.</br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Fats</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> Fats are an important source of energy, and they help you metabolize vitamins A, D, E, and K. Still, fats supply a lot of calories, so limit them to no more than one-third of your daily count.<br><strong>Where:</strong> Have four of the following servings daily: 2 ounces cheese, 2 tablespoons peanut butter, 3/4 cup tuna salad, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon mayonnaise, 3 or 4 ounces lean meat, 1 egg or egg yolk, 1/2 small avocado, 1 tablespoon butter. When cooking, stick to the more healthful unsaturated fats, including olive, canola, and peanut oils. Avoid less desirable saturated fats, found in meat and dairy products, as well as palm and coconut oils.</br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Calcium</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> Calcium is critical in building your baby's bones and teeth. If you don't consume enough during pregnancy, the fetus will rob your calcium stores, putting you at risk for bone loss.<br><strong>Where:</strong> To get the necessary 1,200 milligrams, consume at least four of the following servings: 8 ounces skim milk, 1 cup raw dark green leafy vegetables (salad greens, broccoli, spinach, kale), 3 to 4 ounces canned salmon or sardines, 3/4 cup cottage cheese, 1 cup yogurt, or 1 ounce hard cheese.</br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Iron</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> Iron is required to make hemoglobin, the red-blood-cell component that carries oxygen through the bloodstream. During pregnancy, more hemoglobin is required to supply your baby with oxygen. And the fetus also uses iron to build its own blood supply.<br><strong>Where:</strong> Pregnant women need twice as much iron -- about 30 milligrams a day -- so your doctor may prescribe a prenatal vitamin that contains iron. You should also try to eat some of the following foods daily: dried fruits, lean red meat, dried beans and pasta, whole-grain breads, and dark green leafy vegetables.</br></br><strong>Vitamin C</strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> This nutrient is essential because it helps in the manufacture of collagen, a protein that provides structure to your baby's bones, cartilage, muscles, and blood vessels. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant, which means that it helps prevent disease.<br><strong>Where:</strong> Your body can't store vitamin C, so it's crucial that you consume the necessary 65 milligrams daily. Get it by eating two to three of the following servings: 1/2 cup citrus-fruit juice, 1/2 grapefruit, 1 medium orange, 1/2 cup cantaloupe, 1/2 cup shredded cabbage or coleslaw, 2/3 cup cooked broccoli, 3/4 cup cooked cauliflower, 1 1/2 large tomatoes.</br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Folic Acid</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> This B vitamin is used to produce the extra blood you and your baby need and helps some enzymes function. Taken before conception and early in pregnancy, folic acid also helps prevent neural-tube defects (which occur when the brain, spinal cord, or their coverings do not form normally) and cleft lip or palate (a gap in the lip or roof of the mouth).<br><strong>Where:</strong> Good sources of folic acid include leafy green vegetables, broccoli, asparagus, lean beef, oranges, lentils, and peanuts. The FDA now requires that pastas, breads, and grains be enriched with folic acid, so be sure to eat plenty of these complex carbs. Your doctor may also prescribe a supplement -- 0.4 milligram a day for most women, 4.0 milligrams if you are at risk of having a baby with a neural-tube defect.</br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Vitamin A</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> This nutrient is vital to healthy skin, bones, and eyes and helps to create the cells that will make up your baby's internal organs.<br><strong>Where:</strong> You'll get all you need each day (800 micrograms) with just four servings of the following: 3/4 cup vegetable juice, 3/4 cup dark yellow vegetables, 8 ounces milk, 1/2 cup cantaloupe, 1 large peach or nectarine, 1 cup dark leafy vegetables. <em>Caution: Excessive levels of vitamin A (over 10,000 IU) can be harmful to you and your baby, so don't overdo it with supplements.</em></br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Carbohydrates</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> Vitamin D helps build bone, tissue, and teeth. It also enables your body to use calcium and phosphorus.<br><strong>Where:</strong> Your four 8-ounce servings of skim milk are about the best source of the 10 micrograms you need daily. Egg yolks, sardines, and canned salmon also provide vitamin D. Or get a little sunshine, which helps your skin manufacture it.</br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Zinc</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> This new addition to the must-have pregnancy diet has recently proved to aid fetal growth.<br><strong>Where:</strong> You can get the necessary 20 milligrams a day in your recommended amount of whole grains, meat, and milk, as well as oysters, shellfish, and other seafood.</br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Fluids</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> Water is essential for developing new cells, maintaining blood volume, and processing other nutrients. It also minimizes swelling, constipation, and your risk of urinary tract infections.<br><strong>Where:</strong> Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day, including milk, fruit juices, and decaffeinated tea or coffee.</br></br>"

 9 Food Myths,http://www.parenting.com/article/9-food-myths,"<b>Myth:</b> If your bottle-fed baby is constipated, you should switch to a low-iron formula.<b>Fact:</b> The amount of iron in formula doesn't affect an infant's bowel functions. In fact, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, giving low-iron formulas to a baby could lead to anemia, a deficiency in red blood cells that can result in learning delays down the road. Although breast milk contains little iron (the reason low-iron formulas were originally introduced decades ago), the small quantities that are in it can be easily absorbed by an infant's digestive tract. The iron in formula, however, is not as readily absorbed, so more must be added to ensure that babies get enough, says M. Edward Keenan, M.D., an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. If your baby seems constipated, discuss adding a little fruit juice to his diet with his pediatrician.<b>Myth:</b> When you introduce solids, use jarred food because it's healthier.<b>Fact:</b> Jarred baby food is convenient and healthy, ""but it doesn't contain any nutritional magic,"" says Ellyn Satter, author of <i>Child of Mine: Feeding With Love and Good Sense.</i> Although it's more work, it's just as healthy to start a baby older than 6 months on homemade foods (before then, just breast milk or formula is appropriate). ""And giving your baby a taste of your meals will introduce her to new flavors and may make her more curious about food,"" says Satter.At first, try cooked, pureed apples, pears, peaches, carrots, corn, green beans, potatoes, or peas. You can also mash ripe bananas and avocados. By the time she's 9 months old, your baby can eat fish, chicken, turkey, beef, and soy foods that have been chopped up in a food processor.However, do not serve canned soups, processed meats, or frozen entrees to children under age 1, since high-sodium foods are hard for them to digest, says William Dietz, M.D., a pediatrician and the director of the division of Nutrition and Physical Activity at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta. You should also stick to jarred rather than homemade spinach, beets, collard greens, and squash until your child is 8 months old, since homemade versions can contain nitrates, which, in rare cases, may impair the ability of a baby's blood to carry oxygen to tissues.<b>Myth:</b> It's not healthy for kids to eat red meat and eggs regularly.<b>Fact:</b> You may need to cut back on eating red meat and eggs, but your child doesn't. They're an excellent source of protein, and provide plenty of iron and zinc, essential nutrients for growing children, says Dr. Dietz.While it's healthy to serve red meat and eggs a few times a week, skip the fast-food hamburger. Instead, grill burgers at home or make meatballs. If you're going to offer eggs, only prepare cooked (rather than runny) yolks, and to reduce allergy risks don't serve the whites until age 1.<b>Myth:</b> If your child rejects a food, there's no point in serving it again.<b>Fact:</b> Research shows that a toddler may have to try a new food 15 times before she'll eat more than a spoonful. So when your 2-year-old spits out your homemade lasagna, don't take it personally. Her reaction may be more surprise than dislike. Serve it again  -- she may astonish you by loving it.It's good to offer new foods as many times as you can  -- just be willing to take no for an answer. To cut back on everyone's frustration, serve new dishes along with old favorites, such as milk, rice, bread, or noodles: Your child won't leave the table hungry, and you won't constantly have to pop up and prepare her something special to eat.<b>Myth:</b> Children prefer to eat exactly the same foods over and over.<b>Fact:</b> If your child has ever gone on a food jag, refusing to eat anything except pasta or pancakes for weeks on end, you might think that this is true. And children do enjoy eating some (usually white) foods repeatedly. But they also have a strong instinct to experience new flavors. ""The more variety a child is offered, the more she'll eat,"" says Roberts.So prepare new vegetables, fruits, and meats in different ways, and your child may be more inclined to eat them: Toss chicken into a salad, sprinkle cheese or dressing on top of broccoli, or add carrots to spaghetti sauce.<b>Myth:</b> Introduce veggies before fruits, or he'll get used to the sweet taste of fruits and refuse vegetables.<b>Fact:</b> There's no evidence that offering fruits first will discourage children from eating vegetables, says Susan Roberts, Ph.D., author of <i>Feeding Your Child for Lifelong Health.</i> But no matter what you offer first, introduce any new food slowly: Try a different one every three to four days, and then monitor your baby to make sure he doesn't develop a rash or an upset stomach  -- signs of an allergy.<b>Myth:</b> Kids don't need supplements.<b>Fact:</b> It's often been thought that a healthy diet supplies a child with all essential nutrients, but according to one study, more than 50 percent of American children fall short on at least one vitamin or mineral, and 11 percent are slightly anemic. So talk to your doctor about giving your child a multivitamin/multimineral supplement. If he thinks she needs one, buy one that offers between 50 and 150 percent of the Daily Value of nutrients that 2- to 4-year-olds require.<b>Myth:</b> Limit how much your child eats so he doesn't become overweight.<b>Fact:</b> Young children are good at regulating their food intake, so portion control is likely to backfire, says Dr. Dietz. If kids routinely go hungry, they learn to stuff themselves whenever unrestricted amounts of food are available  -- a habit that can result in weight problems later on.For an overweight child, serve limited quantities of highly caloric foods, like macaroni and cheese, at mealtimes, but extra helpings of fruits and vegetables, so he can still leave the table feeling satisfied, says Dr. Dietz. And find ways to get him to exercise.<b>Myth:</b> If you sweeten your child's vegetables, eventually she won't eat them any other way.<b>Fact:</b> Vegetables help protect against cancer and heart disease, and you should encourage your child to eat them any way you can, says Roberts. And if she gets into the habit of having them regularly, she may start to like them plain once she's older.So feel free to top sweet potatoes, yams, and squash with marshmallows, or sprinkle peas and green beans with a teaspoon of sugar. You can also use the same tactic with tart fruits  -- slice up a kiwi or pineapple and cover it with colored sprinkles. Such small amounts of sugar won't contribute to a sweet tooth, if offered with healthy foods rather than with cakes.When it comes to feeding your child, remember there's room to make mistakes, says Roberts: ""We all do our best, and our best is good enough.""<i>Robert Barnett is the father of a 4-year-old and a coauthor of </i>Volumetrics, <i>a book on weight loss. </i>"
 The Growing Baby's Guide to Nutrition,http://www.parenting.com/article/growing-babys-guide-to-nutrition,"One of the thrills of being a parent is watching your child take that first spoonful of mushy baby food. It's a milestone you'll never forget, and as she advances to chunkier solids and eventually real family meals, both baby's and mom's pleasure increase. But how do you know when your little one is ready for a new food experience? And what should you be feeding her in the meantime to optimize her health? To aid in your food shopping and preparation, here's a guide organized by age group, along with suggested items for nutritious -- and delicious -- daily dining.<b>6 Months: The Experimental Stage</b><b>WHAT TO FEED:</b> Breast milk or formula should make up the bulk of baby's diet for the first six months, meeting most of his nutritional needs. Between 4 and 6 months, you should gradually ease solids into your child's meals. Start with a good source of iron, especially if your infant has been breastfed. (Infant formula has iron added.) Iron-deficiency anemia is a health concern, so it's a must-have mineral for your baby. The best source of iron is red meat or poultry. The next best source is fortified cereals, with whole-grain cereals being better than rice cereal. Mix cereal with enough breast milk or formula to create a liquid consistency, and feed with a spoon. Once he's accepted this, you can offer strained fruits and vegetables. Start with single-ingredient foods; this way, if there are any allergic reactions (rash, vomiting or extremely loose stools), identifying the source won't be an issue. Offer baby about a half-teaspoonful of food at a time. At 7 to 9 months, you should add strained meats and poultry (another great source of iron and protein), and by 10 months, you can begin the transition to table food by offering teething biscuits for baby to gum and mashed foods to introduce a little texture.Making your own baby food is an option, but commercial baby food is safe and nutritious too. Frank Greer, M.D., professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin and former chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics National Committee on Nutrition, points out one advantage to jarred baby food is that it's preserved. ""Home preparations are not sterilized, so moms have to be careful to wash everything very well,"" he says. ""Also, homemade baby food can't be kept around very long. If it hasn't been eaten after two days, throw it out."" Moms who are concerned about preservatives but don't have the time to make baby food at home can try one of the organic baby food lines such as Earth's Best and Gerber Organic.<b>WHAT'S GOING ON AT THIS STAGE:</b> The introduction of solids is a social learning exercise for baby. ""Children want to be part of the family unit, and eating together is important,"" says nutritionist Althea Zanecosky, R.D., former spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association and mother of two. ""Sit baby in a high chair and pull it up to the table. Even if he rejects the food you're trying that day, you're teaching him that food is a social activity. He'll learn that this is the time we put away the toys and we're all together.""<b>WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR:</b> When introducing new foods, it's important to watch for signs of food intolerance. Offer baby a small amount of one new food for several days before moving onto the next. Avoid feeding your baby honey, which can cause infant botulism, a form of food poisoning, and citrus fruits, which are too acidic for young stomachs. Zanecosky notes that while eggs and nuts have a reputation as infant allergens, they are actually fine. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) changed its stance on delaying the introduction of common allergens in 2008. ""Many pediatricians recommend against giving eggs and fish in the first year of life because of allergic reactions, but there is no evidence that introducing these nutrient-dense foods after 4 to 6 months of age determines whether your baby will be allergic to them,"" she explains.Experts also advise that you pay attention to baby's signals of hunger and fullness. By 6 months, an infant will show his desire to eat by opening his mouth and leaning forward. When baby turns his face or mouth away, he's telling you he's finished eating for now.<b>12 Months: Expanding Culinary Horizons</b><b>WHAT TO FEED:</b> By 1 year, baby should be comfortably eating table food. A variety of healthful choices should meet her protein, energy and vitamin needs. Keep in mind that despite having a mouthful of teeth, babies process food by mashing it with their gums, so the table foods shouldn't be too tough. Here's a good test: Try to mash and dissolve the food in your mouth without chewing or biting down. If you're successful, baby should be as well.Breastfeeding may continue at this age, but whole milk is a very important part of a 1-year-old diet as well. ""Children under 2 need whole milk for brain, bone and nervous system development,"" explains Greer. However, Zanecosky notes the AAP's new 2008 milk guidelines, which advise parents to switch to reduced-fat milk for toddlers between 1 and 2 years old if a toddler is overweight or obese, or if there is a family history of obesity, high cholesterol or cardiovascular disease.Focus on good eating habits overall. Don't offer too many fried foods or sweets that are high in fat, and give your tot nutritious snacks like fresh fruit or graham crackers. Offer 100 percent whole-wheat bread or whole grains instead of white bread.<b>WHAT'S GOING ON AT THIS STAGE:</b> ""Babies are learning about taste and texture, as taste buds and swallowing skills come together between 12 and 18 months,"" says Janice E. Stuff, Ph.D., R.D., assistant professor at the USDA/ARS Children's Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ""So if your child rejects a certain food, try again later. Or, if she's pushing food around, it means she's had enough. Put her plate aside -- in an hour she may want it again.""Studies show that babies eat when they're hungry and don't eat when they're not. ""Children have a wonderful ability to self-regulate,"" Zanecosky says. ""You really have to listen to their cues. If they're not hungry, don't force them to eat, even if it's inconvenient for you. Bring portable food with you for them to eat later.""<b>WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR:</b> If, like many kids, baby rejects vegetables, you can substitute fruits, which have many of the same nutrients. For example, both zucchini and cantaloupe are good sources of vitamin A. Start with the zucchini on the plate, but keep cantaloupe available as a backup.<b></b>18 Months: Try Everything<b>WHAT TO FEED:</b> By 1 1/2, toddlers are more adept at eating finger foods or using a spoon, but they still require supervision at mealtime. Serve table food cut in very small pieces, and avoid choking hazards like popcorn, hard candy, hot dogs, jellybeans, chunks of carrots, grapes and raisins.It's important not to rely on milk -- breast or otherwise -- as the sole source of key nutrients at this point. ""Keep trying a variety of foods, using the major food groups as a guide,"" says Greer.<b>WHAT'S GOING ON AT THIS STAGE:</b> At this age, baby will point, try to articulate a word for food, or bang his fists or a utensil on the high chair tray if he's still interested in eating. It's perfectly fine to offer more until your little one indicates he's had enough. A food baby rejected at 12 months might be acceptable to him at 18 months, and having family members as role models will encourage him to try new foods. If baby sees his sister eating her vegetables, he'll try his too."
 Is Fish Okay for Babies?,http://www.parenting.com/article/should-babies-eat-fish,"The <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">nutritional</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> benefits of Omega 3 foods like salmon, tuna and other fish to infants.As a pediatrician and father of eight, I've realized how much children's health and behavior is affected, for better or worse, by what they eat. Of course, you already know how important a balanced diet full of whole grains, vegetables, fruit and lean proteins is, but when it comes to babies and toddlers, one thing I always found missing from their diet was fish. Parents didn't seem to think it was a ""baby"" food.But over the years, I'd been reading more and more about the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, essential nutrients found in seafood. Study after study was proving their contribution to infant brain development and more. I began ""prescribing"" omega-3's to my patients in 2000 by encouraging their parents to offer them more fish. Since then, I've only grown more convinced that omega-3's are the head-to-toe nutrient because they're good for nearly every organ of a child's body, from the brain to the skin. Most parents, however, are unsure about feeding their babies fish, which is the richest source of DHA, the healthiest type of omega-3 fatty acid for infants. Here's why—and how—to ""go fish,"" for both your baby and you!What eating fish can do for you and your baby:In the '80s and early '90s, initial research suggested that infants who received DHA-enriched formula experienced improved cognitive development, leading the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in 2001, to allow infant formula to be supplemented with the brain-building omega-3, DHA. Since then, the proof keeps piling up. A 2003 study in the journal Pediatrics found that mothers who took omega-3 supplements during pregnancy and lactation increased their children's cognitive abilities at 4 years of age. In 2005, another study revealed that schoolchildren who were given omega-3 supplements showed improved reading and spelling scores. Since a child's brain grows fastest prenatally and continues to grow rapidly in the first year of life, tripling in size by the end of the first year, this is an ideal time to get DHA into his diet.Another study found that toddlers whose mothers had higher DHA blood levels at delivery were better able to maintain focus on an object compared with tots whose mothers had lower DHA levels.DHA has been shown to help sharpen vision in infants.Research has shown that adults who consume more omega-3's have a lower rate of mood disorders and that women who eat fish high in these fatty acids during pregnancy suffer less postpartum depression. Why? Omega-3's may act in the brain to raise levels of ""happy"" hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, the neurotransmitters in the brain that are also targeted by some prescription antidepressants. I'll eat to that!These fantastic fatty acids have also been linked to improved immunity. In one study, Danish toddlers who consumed formula supplemented with fish oil had much higher levels of a protein that's key to healthy immune function than those who drank plain formula or cow's milk.Omega-3's can decrease inflammation in all parts of the body, including the skin. Serving a little salmon or chunk-light tuna to your baby before 9 months may actually help to protect him from devel­oping the allergic skin condition, according to a Swedish study.Answers to the most common questions parents ask me:Except for shellfish, you can serve your baby puréed or mashed fish as early as 6 months when he starts eating solids. Fish may seem like a ""grown-up"" food, but it is the ideal fare for infants. Read on for serving ideas.Oily fish such as chunk-light tuna, sardines, halibut and salmon are the best sources of healthy omega-3's. But sardines aren't practical for feeding to a baby, and halibut and tuna are higher in mercury. That makes salmon the best source of DHA (again, the star omega-3 fatty acid) and, in my opinion, the healthiest fish for kids and adults alike. But almost all seafood contains omega-3's, so try giving your baby a variety of low-mercury fish. Pollock is used in most commercial fish sticks and is another good choice.Some fish are high in mercury and other pollutants. Check out the ""Mercury Meter,"" a guide to mercury levels in commonly consumed fish, from the Natural Resources Defense Council. Try to stick to the fish in the ""low mercury"" category, though infants can eat up to three ounces per week of the fish listed as ""moderate mercury"" (adults can eat up to six ounces). Avoid those fish in the ""high"" category altogether. Finally, shellfish can be allergenic; your doctor may recommend holding off until age 2.Omega-3's are the standout nutrient, but fish is also a wonderful source of lean protein. It's high in vitamin D, too, an important vitamin for strong bones that many children are lacking, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.I recommend that infants get around 300 milligrams of DHA per day, more than half of which they can get from their regular daily feedings of breast milk or formula fortified with DHA. On top of that, try to give your solids-eating tot a total of about two ounces of wild salmon per week. Once your baby is off formula and/or breast milk, try to up her amount of wild salmon to six or seven ounces per week. If you find it difficult to reach that amount, consider a supplement to make up the difference. Ask your doctor for a recommendation, or try my own DHA liquid called Go Fish (find retailers at <a class=""vglnk"" href=""http://Drsearshealthykids.com"" rel=""nofollow""><span>Drsearshealthykids</span><span>.</span><span>com</span></a>).You want to be careful that you're not consuming too much mercury but also getting a healthy amount of DHA. Stick to the recommendations already given in terms of how much fish you eat and, in addition, make sure your prenatal vitamin contains DHA (most do). Try to get at least 300 milligrams per day. For reference, the amount of DHA and other omega-3's in six ounces of wild Alaskan salmon is around 2,000 milligrams.Doubtful your baby will eat fish? Start with salmon, and try these tips:Pop open a can of boneless wild salmon, and dole out bites to your baby (no need to cook it!). Blend the salmon flakes into mac 'n' cheese or mashed potatoes. Another option: HappyBaby sells a frozen puree of wild salmon, lentils and sweet potatoes (find retailers at <a href=""http://www.happybabyfood.com/"" target=""_blank"">Happybabyfood.com</a>).Puree cooked salmon (canned or fresh) with lemon, olive oil and seasonings then spread it on bread or crackers.My daughter, Hayden, makes delicious breaded salmon strips that her son loves. Just as you would with chicken fingers, dip inch-wide strips of salmon fillet into beaten eggs and coat them with a mixture of whole-wheat flour, whole-wheat bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and a dash of salt. Then bake the strips for about eight minutes. However you prepare it, offer fish to your baby from the start, and it will be a favorite food.Learn more about <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/dha-a-smart-supplement"">DHA for kids</a>"

 Amniotic Fluid: What You Need to Know,http://www.parenting.com/article/amniotic-fluid-what-you-need-to-know,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekThe liquid surrounding your baby-to-be is much more than a watery home: It's a cushion that protects the fetus from physical trauma (if you fall, for instance), a shield against infection, and a backup source of fluid and nutrients. It also helps the baby's digestive and respiratory systems develop properly.<br><br>During your first 16 weeks, this fluid is produced by the placenta, the fetus's skin, and the umbilical cord. After that, it consists also of recycled urine: The fetus swallows the liquid, which is processed through the kidneys and excreted in a continuous cycle. You have 800 to 1,000 milliliters of fluid by your third trimester (three-and-a-half to just over four cups), says Brian S. Carter, M.D., associate professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in Nashville, TN. Your doctor can check your amniotic fluid by ultrasound if he suspects a problem.<br><strong><br>When Levels Are Too High:</br></strong><br><br>Too much amniotic fluid can indicate a birth defect, such as a gastrointestinal blockage, or in some cases a chromosomal problem in the fetus. Signs of excess fluid (which affects 1 percent of pregnant women) include decreased fetal movement and a noticeable increase in the size of the baby’s abdomen. No need to worry though: Most women with this condition go on to deliver healthy babies.</br></br></br></br></br><strong>When Levels Are Too Low:</strong><br><br>An inadequate amount of fluid, which affects 4 percent of expectant women, can be caused by a tear in the amniotic membrane, problems with the placenta, or an infection, such as an STD. Without enough amniotic fluid to float in, a fetus can sit on the umbilical cord and cut off its blood supply, and if amniotic fluid volume is too low for many weeks, the baby might be born prematurely, and/or with poor lung development and premature delivery.</br></br>Signs of low amniotic fluid volume can include leaking fluid, a smaller-than-average belly on the mother, and decreased fetal movement. You're at greater risk if you have chronic high blood pressure.<br><br><strong>What You Can Do:<br/></strong><br>If you suffer from either condition, your doctor will probably administer regular nonstress tests and ultrasounds for the rest of your pregnancy and, in some cases, may even put you on bed rest. Too much fluid may be treated with medication. Drinking an extra eight cups of water a day can help women with too little fluid increase their levels.<em></em></br></br></br><em>Nichole Cipriani is a freelance writer.</em>"

Just follow this guideDespite parents' worries, children will select a diet that's good for them if they are given the right foods to choose from. How you've handled food up to now will influence how your toddler reacts to new foods. Try to introduce them in a matter-of-fact way. Offer small amounts of a variety of foods to help your toddler understand the concept of choice.To make sure your child receives needed nutrients, plan meals around the five major food groups, those you've seen so often in the food pyramid: the bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group; fruits; vegetables; meat and fish; and dairy products.We spoke with Ann Shaw, Ph.D., a research nutritionist with the Human Nutrition Information Services (the agency that created the new food pyramid) to adapt the number of servings in each food group, as well as the serving sizes, for children ages 2 to 5. In general, children need about the same number of servings in each group as adults do, but their recommended serving sizes are approximately one-third smaller.When your child is younger than 2, her nutritional requirements and the amount of food she needs are somewhat different, so rely on your pediatrician's advice. All children under 2, for example, have a need for fat, which should not be limited in their diets. The most important thing you can do for your ""under 2"" is serve a wide variety of foods from each of the five food groups.For all young children, Shaw says, snacks should play an important role in fulfilling nutritional needs. Toddlers tend to have small appetites and may not be able to consume a full serving at one time. Also, large portions are often overwhelming, so start out with small portions. Your child can always ask for seconds.We also talked to five dietitians and asked for tips to ease the transition from infant feeding to the wider world of toddler nutrition. They've come up with some practical - and creative - advice that underscores the importance of your role in setting your kids up for a lifelong commitment to good nutrition.Toddlers need at least six servings from this food group every day. One serving consists of one third cup cooked pasta, cereal, or rice; two thirds of an ounce of ready-to-eat cereal; or two thirds of a slice of bread.Toddlers should consume a variety of breads, cereal, rice, and pasta so they receive enough fiber and carbohydrates, which provide energy. Toddlers need - and expend - tremendous amounts of energy. Also, many ready-to-eat cereals are enriched with iron and will help your child meet the daily requirement for this nutrient. This food group is one with which your toddler will be most familiar. Rice or barley cereal is the first solid introduced to a baby's diet. Soon they graduate to the little round cereal that is a perennial toddler favorite. Also, bits of bread, especially chewy bread and crackers, often soothe teething babies.Most toddlers can handle a small sandwich, and this is a good way to serve them bread, says Corinne Montandon, Ph.D., R.D., a nutritionist with Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. She recommends that you make sandwiches with nutritious whole-grain breads. Although many white breads are enriched (which means vitamins and minerals have been added), they don't contain as much fiber.Your child may like white bread, but now you need to broaden his tastes. Try making a sandwich with half white and half wheat bread, then cut it into small triangles and arrange some shapes white-side up and some brown-side up, and also point some toward the top of the plate and some toward the bottom. Don't forget to try other kinds of bread, too, such as bagels or pita bread.Montandon had these suggestions to help you add toddler appeal to some foods in this group:      To get the vitamins and minerals they need, children should eat three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruits every day. One serving equals two thirds cup of raw, leafy vegetable; one third cup of raw, cooked, or canned fruit or vegetable; a small piece of fruit; one half cup of fruit or vegetable juice; or one sixth cup dried fruit. These daily servings should include at least one vitamin C source (citrus fruits, strawberries, and melon) and one vitamin A source (deep green and yellow fruits and vegetables, such as peaches, carrots, spinach, broccoli, and squash).Read labels carefully when choosing canned or processed fruits and vegetables, says Trish Riley Vignati, R.D., a research nutritionist at Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta. Check for added sugar and salt, especially in canned vegetables, which often have an enormous amount of added salt. Look for cans marked ""low-salt"" or ""no salt."" Check fruit juice labels carefully, too, to be sure the product is 100-percent juice. Many have added sugar or water.Children like the variety of bright colors and textures that fruits and vegetables offer, so it'll probably be easier than you might think to get your child to eat them. Vignati suggests these steps to make them even more enticing:     To meet his protein requirements, a toddler's daily servings from this food group should add up to three and a half ounces of meat, fish, or the equivalent in meat alternatives such as cooked dried beans and eggs. One serving of meat or fish consists of one and two thirds ounces, and one serving of meat alternatives consists of one third cup cooked beans, one small egg, or one and one third tablespoons of peanut butter used in a sandwich. (These amounts are the equivalent of roughly an ounce of meat.)When serving meat to your toddler, make sure it's been cooked thoroughly. Cut the meat into pieces that are small enough for him to manage, yet not large enough to choke on. When you serve fish, be especially careful to pick through the entire portion and remove any bones.Because there are so many interesting ways to serve meats - in a vegetable stew, perhaps, or broiled or sautéed - parents should be able to avoid giving children fried meat, says Yvonne Bronner, R.D., a nutritionist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore. To make meat dishes as healthy as possible, remove excess fat and skin before preparing. Steering your kids clear of high-fat tastes early on gives them a head start on a lifetime of healthy eating habits. Bronner says a great way to get your toddler to eat meat (and some vegetables, too) is to include him in the preparation of a Chinese stir-fry (under close supervision, of course). Cut up an assortment of colorful vegetables - red, green, and yellow peppers, broccoli, carrots - and slice up some chicken or beef. Let your child pick out the bits he wants for his dinner, drop them into the pan, and you can both watch them cook.Toddlers need at least three servings of dairy foods per day. One serving is equivalent to two thirds cup of yogurt, two thirds cup of milk, one ounce of natural cheese, or one and one third ounces of processed cheese. Dairy foods are an important source of protein and calcium - a vital nutrient for young children because it helps build strong bones. The right stuff for toddlers is similar to the right stuff for everyone. You'll just have to help get it down.Children should consume 800 milligrams of calcium every day. Milk and yogurt are particularly rich in calcium, and relying on them can help your child meet the daily calcium requirement. Three servings of milk or yogurt add up to two cups per day. A cup of milk contains 300 milligrams of calcium and a cup of yogurt contains 340 milligrams. Ask your doctor whether you should feed your toddler whole or low-fat milk.Cheese will add to the daily calcium count, but the amount of calcium in a serving of cheese varies from 175 to 300 milligrams, depending on the type. An ounce of American cheese, for example, has 175 milligrams and an ounce of cheddar has 200 milligrams. Many processed cheeses are convenient, but they're loaded with fat, so try not to serve them too often.In addition to the approximately 600 milligrams of calcium that's found in three servings of dairy foods, your child will get some calcium from other foods in his diet, including dark green leafy vegetables, bread products (which are usually calcium enriched), and even orange juice.Most children like milk but may reject yogurt because it has a slightly sour taste, says nutritionist Laraine Ludlow, who teaches a course for parents called ""Nutrition and Your Child"" at Westchester Community College in Valhalla, NY. To help your child cultivate a taste for yogurt, she recommends introducing it early on, at about the same time as milk. Ludlow also suggests dressing up yogurt and other dairy foods in these toddler-friendly ways:       "
 More New Moms Eating Their Placentas,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/melanie-parentingcom/more-new-moms-eating-placentas,"Following the birth of my first son, I had no plans for my placenta other than to merely get it out of me.

But during my second pregnancy, under the care of homebirth midwives, I requested that they save my placenta, for… well, I don’t know. I had vague plans to plant a tree in honor of my son’s birth, and bury the placenta at the site, but here we are, two years later, with no new tree and the placenta still in a Ziploc bag in our garage deep-freeze with my husband threatening to use it as fish bait. Although most women in the U.S. have no intention of doing anything with their placenta, a small but growing number of women are choosing to eat it, according to <em><a href=""http://nymag.com/news/features/placenta-2011-8/"">New York Magazine</a>.</em><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/lauren-parentingcom/unborn-babies-will-eat-your-placenta?cid=plusblog"">Plus: Unborn Babies Will Eat Your Placenta</a>While most of us know how vitally important an organ the placenta is during pregnancy, filtering toxins while passing vitamins, oxygen and other nutrients from mom to baby, an increasing number of new moms believe that a placenta still has plenty to offer after birth and are engaging in placentophagia, or the practice of placenta consumption. <em>Why, you might rightly ask?</em> Beyond the fact that virtually all land mammals do so (leading some to think that there must be a reason behind this natural compulsion), placenta contains plenty of iron, B-12 and certain hormones, which some believe increase a new mom’s strength and milk production and even stave off postpartum depression (although scientific studies have yet to back this up).<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/gallery/ridiculous-parenting-products?pnid=113777?cid=plusblog"">Placenta Teddy Bears &amp; Other Ridiculous Parenting Products</a>While some hospitals have policies against releasing placentas to their former owners, those who have managed to tote them home along with their new babe have done everything from devouring placenta in stew, smoothie, jerky, or capsule form. And, like just about everything else nowadays, you can hire out your placenta prep—which is a good thing, considering how tired us new moms are <em>before</em> getting to indulge in any placenta. Should we ever have another baby, I’d actually consider the dehydration/encapsulation method (but I don't think I could stomach eating placenta for dinner)—with three kids at home, I’d think I could use any help I could get in getting back on my feet.<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/after-labor-care-for-the-placenta?cid=plusblog"">Plus: After Labor: Caring for a Retained Placenta</a>What about you, would you eat your placenta?"
 USDA Dietary Guidelines for Children,http://www.parenting.com/article/usda-dietary-guidelines-children,"New USDA Dietary Guidelines reveal the <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">health</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> risks in the way most kids eat. Here’s how to start fighting the childhood obesity epidemicIf we are what we eat, then American kids are Fritos. That’s just one of the major findings from the new USDA Dietary Guidelines. Fries and chips are the only “vegetables” on the list of top 25 calorie sources; fruit juice is the sole “fruit” to make the leaderboard.The prevalence of these foods plays a big role in the childhood-obesity epidemic, which affects far more than our children’s waist sizes. Many chronic conditions are on the rise among kids, including asthma, allergies, diabetes, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). And all of these conditions have been linked to what kids eat. Improving children’s diets in the following three areas that were addressed in the report would go a long way toward helping our kids stay healthy:<strong>Go low when it comes to salt. </strong>Most kids over 2 consume too much sodium, which can lead to high blood pressure. White bread is kids’ biggest source of salt because they eat so much of it. Excess sodium is also hidden in many processed, frozen, and restaurant foods. <strong>The fix: </strong>Go with low-sodium whole grains when choosing bread. Eat at home more often, and choose fresh foods over frozen or processed products.<strong> </strong><strong>Get off the SoFAS! </strong>This acronym may be the next buzzword in the childhood obesity discussion. SoFAS—“solid fats and added sugars”—make up a whopping 35 percent of our calories and have almost no nutritional value. These unhealthy fats, which are solid at room temperature, are found mostly in butter, stick margarine, and red meat. That means they’re in many children’s-menu staples: pizza, hot dogs, bacon, French fries, and desserts. <strong>The fix: </strong>Whenever possible, avoid these foods and use oils to replace solid fats when cooking.<strong>Watch the added sugars. </strong>Sugars are healthy in whole foods like fruits and milk because these foods also contain nutrients that signal the body to use the sugar correctly. But when they are added to nutritionally empty foods (like many desserts), the natural process is thrown off. <strong>The fix: </strong>Make sweets an occasional treat in your family. Most important: View these findings as a road map to dietary change. Your children’s health depends on it.<em>Alan Greene, M.D.</em> <em>is a pediatrician and the author of the bestselling </em>Raising Baby Green. <em>He lives in Danville, CA.</em>"
