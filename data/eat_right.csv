Whether you're bringing a holiday dish to the party or preparing the holiday feast yourself, it's important to practice safe food handling and keep in mind the needs of those who may be vulnerable to food poisoning.       ""While you should always practice safe food handling, some guests might be particularly vulnerable to food poisoning, such as older adults, pregnant women, young children and people with weakened immune systems,"" said Academy spokesperson Libby Mills. ""This may also mean taking special precautions and keeping certain high-risk foods off the menu.""   Food poisoning can affect anyone who eats food contaminated by bacteria, viruses, parasites, toxins or other substances, but those certain groups of people are more susceptible to food poisoning and can be at far greater risk of developing serious or even life threatening health problems.   According to Mills, four simple steps may help significantly reduce your risk of food poisoning during the holiday season:      Wash hands often   Separate ready-to-eat foods from raw meat, poultry, seafood and eggs    Cook to proper temperatures; and    Refrigerate promptly at 40F or below.     Take special care during the holidays to ensure that  vulnerable guests  avoid high-risk foods, such as raw or undercooked eggs, raw or unpasteurized dairy products, raw fish or shellfish, raw or rare meat or undercooked poultry.   ""You might be surprised to learn that French toast, tiramisu, some puddings and even eggnog are on the list of less safe food options for those vulnerable to food poisoning. So be sure to carefully plan your menu and shopping list this holiday season to avoid certain foods if necessary,"" Mills said.

Here are seven things you should know about food safety.       Did you know?  ...that each year roughly one out of six Americans (that's 48 million people) get sick, 128,000 are hospitalized, and 3,000 die from foodborne diseases.   Did you know?  ...that reducing foodborne illness by just 1 percent would keep about 500,000 Americans from getting sick each year. Reducing foodborne illness by 10 percent would keep about 5 million from getting sick.   Did you know?  ...that leftovers should be stored in airtight shallow containers (two inches or less) for rapid cooling and to prevent the spread of bacteria. The time it takes for food in a large container to cool can be long enough for bacteria to grow. Never allow leftovers to cool to room temperature before refrigerating them.   Did you know?  ...a large percentage of food poisoning cases could be eliminated if people washed their hands more often when preparing and handling food.   Did you know?  ...that recent studies show there's no real benefit to washing meat and poultry. In fact, if you think you're removing bacteria from meat and poultry by washing it, you actually might be allowing germs to spread to other ready-to-eat foods and causing cross-contamination in the process. The way to kill bacteria is to cook all meat, poultry and seafood to proper temperatures. And remember to use a meat thermometer to check if your meat is done!   Did you know?  ...that the same pathogens that cause food poisoning can cause arthritis, kidney failure, meningitis and Guillain-Barr syndrome. The Food and Drug Administration estimates that about two to three percent of all food poisoning cases lead to secondary long-term illness such as these.   Did you know?  ...that certain people have an increased risk for foodborne illness. These ""at risk"" groups include:      Pregnant women and newborns     Older adults    People with weakened immune systems and chronic illness including diabetes, kidney disease, AIDS and some cancer patients.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    During the holy month of Ramadan, which occurs on the ninth month of the lunar-based Islamic calendar, all Muslims are required to abstain from food and drink from dawn to dusk for 30 days. Because Ramadan shifts approximately 11 days earlier each year on the solar-based Gregorian calendar, Muslims experience Ramadan in different seasons throughout the course of the lives.   The act of fasting is meant to remind Muslims of the less fortunate and to reinforce the need to be thankful. As one of the five pillars, or duties, of Islam, fasting during the month of Ramadan is mandatory for all healthy adult Muslims. Children who have not reached puberty, the elderly, those who are physically or mentally incapable of fasting, pregnant women, breast-feeding mothers and travelers are exempt.   Fasting during Ramadan means abstinence from all food or drink, including water and chewing gum, from dawn to sunset. It is recommended that before sunrise, Muslims eat a prefast meal known as  suhur . This meal often resembles breakfast, but in some cultures it may include more dinner-like foods. After sundown, Muslims break their fast with  iftar , a meal which usually starts with dates and water or milk, followed by dinner. Muslims are permitted to snack at night between those two meals, and hydration is encouraged, especially when Ramadan falls during summer.   For  suhur ,  iftar  and snacks, Muslims can more easily make it to sundown by eating high-fiber meals to sustain satiety over longer periods, fruits and vegetables to maintain electrolyte stores, and plenty of fluids to maintain hydration. Muslims should also limit fried foods and sugary sweets, the latter of which is a common cultural tradition among many ethnicities during the holy month.   After Ramadan, Muslims celebrate a three-day holiday called  Eid-ul-Fitr . After this  Eid  (""celebration""), Muslims pray the holiday prayer in congregation in the morning, visit family and friends, and celebrate over food, gifts and activities for children.

Reviewed by Sharon Denny, MS, RDN       Published January 07, 2016           Print   Email                March is  National Nutrition Month , when the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reminds everyone to return to the basics of healthy eating. It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Most of us know that good nutrition and a balanced diet are important for good health. However, when we hear buzzwords such as ""calcium deficiency"" or learn that a new multivitamin just hit the shelves, it can make us wonder if the food we're eating is enough. Hint: It likely is.   Taking a daily dose of any of the single minerals, vitamins or multivitamin/mineral supplements that line the shelves of supermarkets and drug stores can be tempting. According to the 2015  Dietary Guidelines for Americans , ""Nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods. Individuals should aim to meet their nutrient needs through healthy eating patterns that include nutrient-dense foods ... [which] contain essential vitamins and minerals and also dietary fiber and other naturally occurring substances that may have positive health effects.""  While there may be a need to supplement our diet at certain times in our lives, the safety of taking a supplement also needs to be considered.    Too much of some vitamins and minerals can cause health issues; and, therefore, recommended levels should not be exceeded.   Who needs supplements?   As it turns out, the best way to be and stay healthy is to choose a wide variety of nutritious foods from all five  MyPlate  food groups. Nutrient deficiencies are not common among Americans, but for varying reasons some people cannot reach the recommended nutrient amounts without using supplements and/or including fortified foods. In addition to a healthy and balanced diet, those individuals may need nutrient supplements depending on their situation. For example, older adults, pregnant women and people who are food insecure are at increased risk of nutrient deficiencies.   In addition, if you are eating less than 1,600 calories each day because you are trying to lose weight, you have a poor appetite or you have trouble eating because you have been using alcohol or drugs, discuss the need for supplements with your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist.   Some individuals are limited in their food choices due to allergies, a medical condition or because they are following a vegetarian or vegan diet. For example, animal foods are the main source of vitamin B12, so people who follow a vegan diet need to eat fortified foods and/or take a supplement.   Women who are at an age where they could become pregnant need to obtain adequate folic acid from fortified foods (cereals and other grains), supplements or both, in addition to consuming folate from foods in a varied diet. Because it helps reduce the risk of some birth defects, folic acid is very important during childbearing years. If lab tests show that a woman's iron status is low during pregnancy, her health-care provider will recommend an iron supplement.   Vitamin D might be a concern among infants, children and young adults. Infants who are breast-fed and children who consume less than the recommended amount of vitamin D fortified milk or formula and those with increased risk of deficiency will likely need supplemental vitamin D. Adolescent girls, meanwhile, might need additional iron.   On the other side of the spectrum, as people age it can be difficult to get enough vitamins B12 and D. Luckily, this is one of the cases where supplements can make a difference. Getting B12 from fortified foods or taking it alone or as part of a multivitamin mineral can help raise B12 in your blood. If you're taking calcium or a multivitamin, try to pick one up that also has vitamin D.   Other groups who may require additional supplementation include people who are taking certain medications or have a health condition that changes how their body uses nutrients, and individuals who have been told by their doctor they have a specific nutrient deficiency.   Your doctor can order tests to help determine if taking a supplement would benefit you. The results might show that you are low in a certain nutrient or you might discover that you're doing just fine. Additionally, review your current diet. An RDN can help you evaluate the foods you eat and make recommendations that meet your personal needs.   Remember, real food contains healthy things a pill can't give us. When we take a nutrient out of a food and concentrate it in a pill, it's not quite the same thing. Be sure to consider your individual situation and consult a doctor or an RDN before considering supplements.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Shopping at a farmers market offers some of the freshest fruits, vegetables and other foods you can find. It also offers the opportunity to buy locally, support small farms and businesses in your area and connect with your community. There are several thousand farmers markets operating in the United States, with more opening every year. Farmers markets offer unique local products you often can't find elsewhere, including local varieties of vegetables and fruits, artisan cheeses, fresh potted herbs, homemade sauces, oven-fresh baked goods and locally produced poultry, eggs and meat.   As you explore farmers markets in your area, be mindful of food safety. Vendors often sell outdoors where their products are exposed to contaminants such as dirt, bugs and pollutants. In addition, market sites often have little access to water for hand and product washing, and electricity for refrigerating. This does not mean you should avoid farmers markets, just be mindful.   Pay attention to vendors' food safety practices as you shop. Most markets have their own food safety rules that vendors must comply with, as well as related government regulations. But, there are also basic guidelines you should follow to ensure farm-fresh food is safe. Check the stand's overall cleanliness, including gloves and clean utensils for food handling, covered garbage cans, coolers for perishables and clean bags.   Take time to talk to and learn from vendors. Many small farmers are eager to talk about their growing methods and how they store and prepare produce and care for their animals. They may even invite you for a farm visit.   Follow these guidelines to reduce your risk of bringing home a case of food poisoning.   Grocery Totes   Reusable grocery totes are a popular, eco-friendly choice to transport food, but be sure to use separate totes for raw meat and poultry and ready-to-eat foods such as fresh produce and breads.   Wash your reusable totes often. According to a 2011 survey from the Academy's and ConAgra Foods' Home Food Safety program, only 15 percent of Americans regularly wash their bags, creating a breeding zone for harmful bacteria that can easily contaminate your foods. Eliminate bacteria by:      Frequently washing your grocery tote, either in the washing machine or by hand with hot, soapy water   Cleaning all areas where you place your totes, such as the kitchen counter   Storing totes in a clean, dry location   Avoiding leaving empty totes in the trunk of a vehicle.     Fruits and Vegetables    In 2011,  Listeria -contaminated produce caused the deadliest foodborne illness outbreak in nearly 90 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Harmful foodborne pathogens such as  E. Coli ,  Salmonella ,  Listeria  and norovirus may contaminate fruits and vegetables from the soil or water or during harvesting. Fortunately, there are ways to reduce your risk:     Shop early in the day for the best selections.   Wash fruits and vegetables thoroughly under running water before eating, cutting or cooking. Dry with a clean cloth or paper towel to eliminate bacteria.   Wash produce even if you plan to peel it before eating. Bacteria present on the outside of foods such as melons and bananas can be transferred to the inside when you cut or peel them.   Refrigerate cut or peeled fruits and vegetables within two hours.   Avoid produce with mold, bruises or cuts, as these are great places for bacteria to hide and spread rapidly to other places on the fruit.     Milk and Cheeses     Buy only pasteurized milk products.   Pregnant women, older adults, young children and people with weakened immune systems are at higher risk for illness caused by  Listeria . Soft cheeses made from unpasteurized milk are one common source of  Listeria . If you buy soft cheese, including feta, Brie, Camembert, blue-veined cheeses, queso blanco, queso fresco and panela, check the label to make sure it's made from pasteurized or treated milk.     Eggs     Eggs should be properly chilled at 45F.   Make sure eggs are clean and the shells are not cracked.     Meat     Meat should be kept in closed coolers with adequate amounts of ice.   Perishables must be refrigerated within two hours (one hour if the air temperature is above 90F), so bring an insulated bag or cooler to keep meat cool on the way home.   Separate meat from other ready-to-eat foods, so juices from raw meat (which may contain harmful bacteria) do not come in contact with produce and other foods. This includes using separate grocery totes.     Juices and Cider     Buy only juice or cider that has been pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria. Pregnant women, children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems should be especially careful.     Other Goods   Many farmers markets sell prepared foods. Remember, foods that should be served hot should be kept hot, and cold foods should be kept cold (under 40F). If you buy perishable items, they should not remain unrefrigerated for over two hours, and only one hour in hot weather (90F or above).

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Food Safety Tips for Older Adults, Pregnant Women, Young Children and Those with Weakened Immune Systems    The human body is well equipped to fight off certain harmful pathogens, but food poisoning is still a serious concern with 1 in 6 Americans being sickened by food poisoning each year. This is an even greater concern for certain groups of people who are more susceptible to food poisoning, accounting for nearly 25 percent of the population, including pregnant women, young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems or certain chronic illnesses.   These individuals can be at a far greater risk of developing serious illness with long-term effects or even death if contracting food poisoning, and once contracted, these infections can be difficult to treat and can reoccur.   If you're at an increased risk or more vulnerable to food poisoning or if you're preparing food for those who are, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics recommends the following tips to reduce the risk of food poisoning as you shop, cook and eat.   Buying: Food safety begins with food selection in the grocery store   Check food labels      The ""sell by"" date tells the store the last day they should sell that specific package.     Buy only milk, cheese and other dairy products from the refrigerated section.     When buying fruit juice from the refrigerated section of the store, be sure that the juice label says pasteurized.      When shopping, pick up meat, poultry and seafood last      Make sure each package of meat is wrapped in a separate plastic bag to prevent dripping and place meat at the bottom of the shopping cart.     Make sure packaging is tightly sealed and is very cold to the touch.     If buying perishable goods, plan to go directly home from the grocery store and be sure to refrigerate perishable foods within 2 hours (1 hour if above 90F outside).      Make sure the packaging has not been damaged      Never buy food that is displayed in unsafe or unclean conditions.     Make sure canned goods are free of dents, cracks or bulging lids.     Purchase produce that is not bruised or noticeably damaged.     When purchasing foods from the deli or salad bar, avoid foods containing any raw or undercooked meat, seafood or egg products, i.e., Caesar salad dressing, sushi, ceviche, etc.      Preparing: Many cases of food poisoning can be traced to improper food handling   Wash hands, produce and kitchen surfaces       Wash hands often, including before, during and after meal preparation. Proper hand washing may eliminate nearly half of all cases of food poisoning.     Wash hands in warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds.     Rinse all produce, and rub firm-skin fruits and vegetables under running tap water, including those whose skins and rinds that arent eaten (such as bananas and oranges).     Clean can lids before opening.     Clean all kitchen surfaces and utensils including counter tops, refrigerators, and microwaves.      Keep ready-to-eat foods separate from raw meats, poultry, seafood and eggs      Wash cutting boards, dishes, utensils and counters tops with hot soapy water between the preparation of raw meat, poultry and seafood products and any other ready-to-eat foods.     Prevent cross-contamination by using two cutting boards: one solely for raw meat, poultry and seafood; the other for ready-to-eat foods like breads and vegetables.      Cook to proper temperatures      Cook to proper temperatures and use a food thermometer as this is the only reliable way to determine if cooked foods are done. Harmful bacteria are destroyed when food is cooked to proper temperatures.     Reheat hot dogs, luncheon meats (cold cuts), fermented and dry sausage, and other deli-style meat and poultry products until steaming hot. Although pre-cooked, they can become contaminated with harmful organisms after they have been processed and packaged.      Storing: How you store food is just as important as the preparing and buying   Refrigerate promptly at or below 40F or freeze at or below 0F      Refrigerate foods within 2 hours of cooking or purchasing (1 hour if above 90F) to slow the growth of bacteria and prevent food poisoning.     Use a refrigerator thermometer to ensure your fridge and freezer are cold enough.     Use the refrigerator/freezer storage chart or the Is My Food Safe? app to check the shelf life of a food item.     Store leftovers in shallow covered containers (two inches deep or less) and consume within three to four days.      Eating Out: When eating out, be sure to avoid high-risk foods      Ask how the food is prepared and make sure it doesn't contain uncooked ingredients such as eggs, sprouts, meat, poultry or seafood.     Request thoroughly cooked foods and if served rare, send it back.     Avoid foods that contain raw or undercooked eggs such as dressings and sauces like hollandaise, homemade mayonnaise, and Caesar salad dressing and desserts like chocolate mousse, meringue pie and Tiramisu.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    You may pump iron at the gym a few times a week, but your body pumps it continuously through the bloodstream every day. Iron is needed to make hemoglobin, a part of red blood cells that acts like a taxicab for oxygen and carbon dioxide. It picks up oxygen in the lungs, drives it through the bloodstream and drops it off in tissues including the skin and muscles. Then, it picks up carbon dioxide and drives it back to the lungs where it's exhaled.   Iron Deficiency   If the body doesn't absorb its needed amount of iron, it becomes iron deficient. Symptoms appear only when iron deficiency has progressed to iron deficiency anemia, a condition in which the body's iron stores are so low that not enough normal red blood cells can be made to carry oxygen efficiently.  Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and the leading cause of anemia in the United States.       Symptoms include:     Fatigue   Pale skin and fingernails   Weakness   Dizziness   Headache   Glossitis (inflamed tongue)     Sources of Iron   The body absorbs two to three times more iron from animal sources than from plants. Some of the best dietary sources of iron are:     Lean beef    Turkey   Chicken   Lean pork   Fish     Although you absorb less of the iron in plants, every bite counts, and adding a source of vitamin C to vegetarian sources of iron will enhance absorption. Some of the best plant sources of iron are:     Beans, including pinto, kidney, soybeans and lentils   Dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach   Fortified breakfast cereals   Enriched rice   Whole-grain and enriched breads     High-Risk Populations   The following populations are at a higher risk for developing iron deficiency.   Women Who Are Pregnant or Breast-feeding:  Increased blood volume requires more iron to drive oxygen to the baby and growing reproductive organs. Consult your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist before taking an iron supplement.   Young Children:  Babies store enough iron for the first six months of life. After six months, their iron needs increase. Breast milk and iron-fortified infant formula can supply the amount of iron not met by solids. Cow's milk is a poor source of iron. When children drink too much milk, they crowd out other foods and may develop ""milk anemia."" Two cups of milk per day is the recommended amount for toddlers.    Adolescent Girls:  Their often inconsistent or restricted diets  combined with rapid growth  put adolescent girls at risk.   Women of Childbearing Age:  Women with excessively heavy menstrual periods may develop iron deficiency.   How to Prevent Iron Deficiency   Eat a balanced, healthy diet that includes good sources of iron to prevent any deficiencies. Combine vegetarian sources of iron with vitamin C in the same meal. For example: a bell pepper-bean salad, spinach with lemon juice, or fortified cereal and berries.   If treatment for iron deficiency is needed, a health-care provider will assess iron status and determine the exact form of treatment  which may include changes in diet or taking supplements.

The start of a new year offers an opportunity to reflect on and consider what you can do to make your life happier and healthier. Put food safety at the top of your resolution list and commit to safely handling food all year long.   ""While many focus resolutions on health goals like weight loss or training for a marathon, it's also important to consider food safety,"" said registered dietitian and past Academy Spokesperson Joy Dubost (2011-2016). ""By following a few simple steps to safely handle food at home, you can keep food safe and dramatically reduce your risk of food poisoning.""   One in 6 Americans is sickened by food poisoning each year, and while it may involve flu-like symptoms, foodborne illness can cause severe and even life-threatening illnesses.   ""Food safety is an important investment in your entire family's health,"" said Dubost. Young children and infants, pregnant women, older adults and people with chronic diseases such as diabetes are at an increased risk of food poisoning.   In fact,  according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 85 percent of all foodborne illness could be prevented if people just handled food properly.     Ensure your kitchen is equipped for food safety this coming year, and follow these simple steps to properly handle food and reduce your risk of food poisoning:     Wash your hands.  Hand washing has the potential to save more lives than any single vaccine or medical intervention, according to the CDC. Wash hands thoroughly in warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds.   Buy and use a food thermometer.  The only way to determine if harmful bacteria has been eliminated is to cook food to a safe minimum internal temperature. Always use a food thermometer to ensure food is fully cooked. Don't rely upon sight, smell or taste.   Keep it clean.  Use hot, soapy water to wash countertops and surfaces, cutting boards, refrigerator door handles and utensils. After cleaning, keep it clean by avoiding cross-contamination. Start by washing hands thoroughly after handling raw meat, poultry, seafood or eggs. And use a separate cutting board for raw meat and poultry from the cutting board you use for ready-to-eat foods such as bread and produce. Wrap raw meat and poultry in sealed containers or plastic bags and place on the bottom shelf of the refrigerator to prevent the raw meat juices from dripping onto other foods and surfaces.   Safely store leftovers.  Perishable food should not be left at room temperature for more than two hours. Refrigerate or freeze leftovers within two hours of serving or throw them out. In hot weather, when 90F or above, toss within one hour of serving. Use an appliance thermometer to check that the refrigerator is cooling to 40F or below and the freezer is 0F or below.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Have you ever wondered how long dairy and egg products can be safely stored, what type of milk container to buy or how to handle raw eggs? The next time you go grocery shopping or clean out your refrigerator, use the tips below.   Milk     Buy milk and other dairy products toward the end of your shopping trip.   Store milk and other dairy products in the refrigerator below 40F, but never store milk in the refrigerator door where it is susceptible to warmer air from opening and closing the door.   Discard all kinds of milk (whole, low-fat, reduced fat, non-fat, etc.) after one week of opening, no matter what the ""sell-by"" date is.    Ice cream has a shelf life of two to four months because it is stored in the freezer where bacterial growth is significantly slowed due to the colder temperatures. If you make homemade ice cream, be sure to use pasteurized eggs.   Choose milk in cardboard cartons or non-translucent jugs.      Cheese     Tightly wrap hard cheeses such as cheddar, Gouda, Edam and Swiss and they can last for three to four weeks in the refrigerator after opening.   Remove mold from hard cheeses by cutting a one-inch square around it; the rest is safe to eat if only a small area was affected.   Processed cheese spread can keep for three to four weeks in the refrigerator after being opened.    Pregnant women, young children, the elderly and people with weakened immune systems should not eat unpasteurized cheeses or soft cheeses such as Camembert, Brie and blue-veined cheeses.    The softer the cheese, the shorter the shelf life:    Cream cheese can last for two weeks    Cottage cheese can last for one week.    Ricotta cheese can last for one week.          Eggs     Never eat raw eggs (this includes raw cookie dough and batters, too).    When buying eggs, choose a carton that is cold and make sure the eggs are clean and aren't broken or cracked.    Store eggs in the original packaging in the coldest part of the refrigerator,  not  in the egg cups in the door.    Raw eggs should not be kept for more than three weeks in the refrigerator. Hard-boiled eggs can last a week in the refrigerator (in or out of the shell).    If a recipe calls for raw eggs, such as Caesar salad dressing, use a liquid pasteurized egg substitute instead of raw eggs.    Cook eggs until yolks are firm (yolks should not be runny).    Cook egg dishes such as quiche or casseroles to 160F.     Yogurt     Check the ""sell-by"" date on the carton.    Use yogurt within seven to 10 days after buying it.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    If you haven't yet made physical activity a habit, your 30s are a good time to start. Fitness, along with proper nutrition, is important for maintaining a healthy lifestyle. Being fit increases energy, burns calories and may prevent or minimize complications from chronic diseases.   Why Be Fit?   There are many health benefits associated with fitness. To name a few:     Decreased risk of Type 2 diabetes   Decreased risk of hypertension (or high blood pressure)    Decreased high cholesterol   Improved mental health   Weight loss   Better quality sleep   Stress relief    Increased bone density   Decreased risk of early death     Motivation Is Key   You may need some encouragement when it comes to getting fit. What is going to motivate you to move? Come up with a few reasons why being active will help create a healthier you, such as:     Being a positive role model for kids   Decreasing the risk of developing high blood pressure or Type 2 diabetes   Losing weight     How Much Is Enough?   After reviewing years of research, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services developed the  2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans  (a new set of guidelines is expected in 2018). Adults 18 to 64 years old should follow these recommendations:     Do at least 2 hours of moderate-intensity or 1 hours of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity a week.   Include strength training using all of the major muscle groups two days a week or more.   For more health benefits, increase moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity to five hours or include 2 hours of vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity a week.     Healthy pregnant women should get at least 2 hours of moderate-intensity aerobic physical activity spread throughout the week. Women who are used to vigorous-intensity aerobic physical activity can continue physical activity during pregnancy after talking to their doctor.   Does Walking Count?   Walking slowly is considered a light-intensity activity. Brisk walking is an example of a moderate-intensity activity and includes walking and talking but not being able to sing. With vigorous-intensity exercise, you can only say a few words without catching your breath. It is sufficient to do bouts of 10 minutes at a time throughout the week, regardless of the intensity, but the goal is to continue following these guidelines, even when 65 years and older, as able!   No More Excuses   Maybe you have heard that being fit is important, but perhaps you have been busy starting a career or raising a family. If physical activity hasn't been a priority, start now by setting reasonable goals. Begin with activities you enjoy and slowly build up your endurance. To keep on track, record any physical activity you do in a journal.   Life is full of excuses, but physical activity should be an essential part of your life. Being fit will help you stay young on the inside and out, and it can help you breeze through the next few decades by feeling strong and healthy.

Keeping Your Convenience Foods Safe   People are turning to convenience foods such as canned foods, frozen foods and prepared salads to fill their plates at dinnertime instead of preparing meals from scratch. Below are tips to help you purchase and store convenience foods safely.   Deli Meats     Use poultry products purchased from the deli counter within 3 days of purchase and use red meat deli products within 5 to 7 days of purchase.   At-risk consumers  (pregnant women, older adults, babies and people with weakened immune systems) should consult their medical practitioners for advice on consuming deli meats.   For best quality, always reheat hot dogs before eating.     Pre-Prepared Foods     If eating from a salad bar, go early or ask for fresh batches of the items.   Make sure items like egg salad, macaroni salad and potato salad are properly refrigerated below 40F.   Check to make sure containers are well-packed in ice.   Reheat precooked foods such as stuffed chicken breasts and pre-roasted chickens, and eat them the same day you purchase them.     Canned Foods     Avoid buying canned goods that show signs of  bulging, denting or leaking .   Throw away any canned goods in your pantry with similar signs of bulging, denting or leaking.   Store canned goods in a cool, dry place - not above the oven or under the sink.   As a general rule, canned goods can be kept up to 12 months unopened.   Clean cans before opening to avoid contamination of contents.     Frozen Foods      Choose  frozen foods , such as frozen dinners or vegetables, from the back of the freezer case; the items in the back usually remain the coldest.    Keep frozen foods tightly wrapped and date them.   Store at 0F or below.     Don't refreeze thawed food items.      Dried or Cured Meats      Don't buy hanging dried or cured meat if the package is open.     An unopened package of dried meat will keep for up to one year without refrigeration.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Sprouts are skinny little veggies that are big on nutrition. More technically, they begin as seeds that  when exposed to the right temperature and moisture  germinate into very young plants. Common varieties you'll encounter in cuisine include grain, bean or leafy sprouts. Two of the most popular picks are alfalfa and mung bean sprouts. They're usually enjoyed raw and occasionally lightly cooked.   Sprouts and Food Poisoning   Eating sprouts can help promote good health. Unfortunately, they can also trigger food poisoning when consumed raw or even lightly cooked. This is because bacteria can thrive in a warm, humid environment and sprouts are grown in these conditions. In fact, many outbreaks of foodborne illness associated with various types of raw and lightly cooked sprouts have occurred in recent years, mainly by E. coli and Salmonella. Diarrhea, fever and abdominal cramps are common symptoms that occur 12 to 72 hours after infection.   While there are approved plant treatments to reduce contamination, there is no way to guarantee all harmful bacteria are destroyed in raw sprouts. Unfortunately, you can't smell or see if a food is harboring bacteria. Luckily, proper cooking kills harmful bacteria that can be found in sprouts.   High-Risk Individuals   For people at  ""high risk""  for food poisoning, severe and life-threatening illness may result from consuming raw or lightly cooked sprouts. People with weakened immune systems, children, the elderly and pregnant women should not eat any variety of raw or lightly-cooked sprouts. If you're a high-risk individual, thoroughly cook sprouts if you choose to eat them. If you're unsure of your risk level, consult your physician or registered dietitian nutritionist.   Keeping it Safe: From Market to Mealtime   Follow these key tips when buying, storing and eating fresh sprouts:     Buy only fresh sprouts that have been kept properly refrigerated.   Do not buy sprouts that have a musty smell or slimy appearance.   At home, refrigerate sprouts at 40 F or below  in a clean refrigerator.   Wash your hands properly before handling raw sprouts.   Rinse sprouts thoroughly under running water before use.   If you decide to cook sprouts, it can help reduce the risk of food poisoning. Toss them into soups, stews or stir fries near the end of the cooking process  or oven roast until crisp and browned.      Dining Out Advice   Be inquisitive when  eating away from home . It's important to know what's in the food you plan to eat, especially if there's a possibility that ""risky"" ingredients are included, such as raw sprouts in a sandwich, wrap, salad or select Asian foods, like a fresh spring roll. So if it appears that raw sprouts are on the menu, you can ask your server to please leave the sprouts off. And before taking a bite, make sure that they indeed got your order right.   The Bottom Line   In general, the health benefits associated with savoring raw or lightly cooked sprouts outweigh risks for healthy individuals. However, be aware that there is risk of food poisoning if you plan to eat them. If you're a high-risk individual, simply do not eat raw or lightly cooked sprouts. And though not the ideal way to enjoy sprouts in cuisine, the safest bet for all is to thoroughly cook sprouts to reduce the risk of food poisoning.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Juicing is trendy. And drinking fruit or vegetable juice in general can be healthful and refreshing. One way to ensure you're getting plenty of produce in your diet is to fill in gaps of your whole fruit and vegetable intake with 100-percent pure fruit and vegetable juice. But before taking a gulp, know your risks.   Pasteurized or ""raw:"" Which should you buy?   When produce is squeezed into juice, any bacteria present on its outside or inside surface can become part of the finished product. Unless juice is further processed to destroy potentially harmful pathogens, it could be dangerous for those most at risk for food poisoning, potentially causing severe diarrhea or worse symptoms in these high-risk individuals. So in the United States, most juices sold in grocery stores are pasteurized to ensure they're safe to drink. For instance, thermal pasteurization, or heat treatment, is often used to destroy harmful bacteria. Alternative pasteurization treatments are becoming more widely used, too.   Freshly squeezed juice made onsite, such as at a restaurant, juice bar, grocery or health food store, cider mill or farmers market, is not required to be pasteurized. Most people have immune systems strong enough to handle small amounts of bacteria, such as in unpasteurized or ""raw"" juice, and shouldn't be overly worried about its safety. But the Food and Drug Administration recommends high-risk individuals  including infants, young children, pregnant women, older adults and people with weakened immune systems  drink unpasteurized juice only if it is first. brought to a boil to destroy potentially harmful bacteria. The best advice is to drink only those juices that have been pasteurized or otherwise treated to kill harmful bacteria.   Can you make fresh squeezed juice at home safely?    Yes, but clean everything, including all fruits, vegetables, cutting boards, knives, blender or juicing machine and glass or cup. Even if you're not using produce peels, clean them anyway, since bacteria on the outside can contaminate the inside of the fruit or vegetable during cutting and juicing. And even if you follow all safety habits, fresh juice can still pose a risk for food poisoning in susceptible individuals.    Three tips to follow:    1. Be a label reader.  You'll either see wording on juice packaging noting pasteurization. Otherwise, products found on grocery store shelves are unpasteurized, need to be refrigerated and have the following warning label: ""WARNING: This product has not been pasteurized and therefore may contain harmful bacteria that can cause serious illness in children, the elderly and persons with weakened immune systems."" Use these labels to determine which juice to buy.   2. Be inquisitive.  FDA doesn't require a warning label for juice or cider that's freshly squeezed and sold by the glass at farmers markets, orchards, roadside stands and in some juice bars or restaurants. When in doubt, ask whether the juice has been treated to ensure safety.    3. Be clean.  Whenever you're doing your own juicing or watching fresh juice being prepared, make sure cleanliness is evident at all stages of juicing. Then sip safely with confidence.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    In order to substantially decrease your risk of food poisoning you must keep your foods at a safe temperature and out of the infamous ""danger zone."" Now what exactly is this ""danger zone?""   What is the Danger Zone?   As the name suggests, the danger zone refers to the most dangerous temperature for foods, between 40F and 140F. This range of temperature is dangerous because it's below the temperature at which heat destroys bacteria (above 160F), yet above the cooling range (below 40F) where the growth of bacteria is slowed.   Why So Dangerous?   A single bacterium can multiply to trillions in just twenty-four hours when between 40F and 140F. This is because bacteria double approximately every twenty minutes under the right conditions: food, moisture, oxygen and warm temperature. Many foods, with their rich supply of nutrients and moist quality, offer the perfect environment for bacteria to grow. You don't want to spur this bacteria growth by providing a warm temperature as well.       How to Avoid Food Poisoning   Harmful bacteria are one of the main sources of food poisoning in the United States. But most healthy adults don't need to worry about them because your body can handle small amounts of bacteria with no health threat. However, food poisoning risks rise when bacteria multiply to large numbers, which can happen with mishandled foods.   Note:  Populations at a high risk for food poisoning  pregnant women, young children, older adults and people with weakened immune systems  are at a greater risk for food poisoning even when small amounts of bacteria are present.  In order to avoid food poisoning, make sure to keep your foods out of the danger zone. Refrigerate all foods within two hours or one hour if it is over 90F outside, and before eating reheat to a safe minimum internal temperature.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Japan has some of the leading life expectancies in the world: 80 years for males (ranked eighth in the world) and   87 years for females (ranked   first in the world). Japan also boasts the greatest number of centenarians in the world, set to reach 1 million by 2050. Diet has been claimed as the Japanese secret weapon to a long and healthy life. And, one of the most simple and healthy traditional Japanese foods is sushi.   With different types of sushi available, they all have one thing in common  rice. The rice used for sushi is a short-grain rice prepared with vinegar to give it a sticky consistency to help the rice stay together.     Nigiri   Japan's most popular and basic form of sushi  is a piece of raw fish that is placed on top of a small ball of rice. Although raw fish is the most common, tamago (Japanese rolled omelet), cooked or seared meats or fish and vegetables may be placed on the rice. In Japan, this type of sushi is turned upside down and the fish is dipped in the soy sauce rather than dunking the rice.   Maki  is a sushi roll. Nori, or seaweed, is most commonly used as the wrapper to hold everything inside. Typically, nori is on the outside with rice and a filling in the middle. Rolls are very basic in Japan, ranging from cucumbers to natto (fermented soybeans). In the U.S., it's more common to see rolls with the rice on the outside.   Gunkanmaki   sometimes called ""battleship"" style sushi  is a combination of nigiri and maki. The ball of rice is topped with a less-solid filling (for example, uni, oysters or ikura) and held in place by wrapping nori around the outside, forming a rice ""ship"" bottom and holding the filling on top.     While sushi has the potential to be very healthy, it also has the potential to be loaded with hidden calories. To enjoy the benefits of this healthy Japanese food, try the following:     Keep it simple.  Less is more when it comes to sushi. Nigiri is your best pick. Choose a variety of fish to maximize nutrition benefits and minimize potential build up of contaminants, including mercury. Avoid restaurants that make their sushi with a lot of rice and skimp on the fish.  Note: The FDA recommends pregnant women should avoid any raw fish, including sushi.   Choose your rolls wisely.  Watch out for fried fillings, mayo, cream cheese and rolls that are ""crunchy."" Stick with fish and vegetables.   Minimize soy sauce.  It is high in sodium and easy to overuse, and, when possible, choose the ""lower sodium"" version. When using soy sauce, try dipping the fish, not the rice.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Proper handling of seafood can greatly reduce your risk of food poisoning. Keep the following safety tips in mind when buying, storing and preparing seafood.   Buying     Buy fish from reputable sources such as grocery stores and seafood markets.   Buy fresh fish only if it is properly refrigerated (below 40F).   Check to see that flesh is shiny and firm, not separating from the bone, and odor is fresh and mild, rather than overly ""fishy.""   Be aware of possible cross-contamination of cooked and raw seafood if displayed in the same case.   Make sure packaged seafood is well-packed in ice and packages are tightly sealed and free of tears.   Avoid packages of frozen seafood containing ice crystals. This is a sign the seafood has previously thawed and been re-frozen.   Pick up seafood toward the end of your shopping trip and ask to have it bagged separately from other groceries.     Storing     Refrigerate or freeze seafood immediately after purchasing.   Store fresh, pasteurized or smoked seafood products in a refrigerator set at 40F. Use a refrigerator thermometer to check the temperature.   Wrap fresh seafood in cellophane or place in air-tight containers.   Store live clams, oysters, mussels, crabs, lobsters and crayfish in a refrigerator, in well-ventilated containers and cover with a damp cloth or paper towel.   Store frozen seafood in a freezer set at or below 0F until ready to use. Keep it in the original moisture and vapor-proof packages.   Use packaged, frozen seafood before the expiration date. If an expiration date has passed, dont consume the product; throw it away.     Preparing     Keep raw and cooked seafood separate to avoid cross-contamination.   Use two separate cutting boards, one for raw seafood and the other for cooked seafood.   Thoroughly wash your hands, utensils, plates and cutting boards that have touched raw seafood.   Defrost frozen seafood in the refrigerator, under cold running water or in the microwave. Never defrost seafood on the counter.     Cooking     Cook fish to 145F or until it is opaque and flakes easily with a fork.   Pregnant women , older people, young children and people with weakened immune systems should not eat raw seafood such as:    Raw fish (sushi or sashimi).   Raw shellfish (oysters, clams, scallops, mussels or ceviche).   Seafood ordered undercooked or ""rare"" such as tuna carpaccio.   Refrigerated smoked seafood, such as salmon, cod, trout, tuna or mackeral, is usually labeled as ""novo-style,"" ""lox,"" ""kippered,"" ""smoked"" or ""jerky.""

Parents often wonder if they should feed their children fish. After all, nearly all fish contain trace amounts of methylmercury, an environmental contaminant. In large amounts, all forms of mercury are toxic to nerve cells and can cause vision problems, poor coordination and learning impairments.    When it comes to mercury toxicity, the emphasis is on ""large amounts."" The real danger is not consuming enough fish, says Gary J. Myers, MD, pediatric neurologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center. ""Fish is the primary source of omega-3 fatty acids."" Children need these specialized fats to build the structure of their brains from the time of conception to about age 20, he explains. Without an ample supply of omega-3 fats, the body incorporates other fatty acids which do not confer the same benefits to the brain and nervous system.   So what makes parents leery of fish? In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency jointly issued a warning to children, pregnant women and nursing mothers to limit fish to a couple meals weekly and to completely avoid the four fish with the highest levels of mercury: shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish. Limit albacore ""white"" tuna to just once per week, the report added as it is fifth on the list of high-mercury fish. Confusion spread along with the news. Many people became unnecessarily fearful and shunned all fish including the ever-popular, low-mercury canned light tuna.   The only reported cases of mercury poisoning from eating fish occurred in Japan after massive industrial pollution. There are no reports of mercury poisoning from fish consumption from other areas of the world, says Myers. He has studied the health of children in the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean where fish consumption and mercury exposure are at least 10 times higher than in the U.S. Thousands of measurements suggest the children are very healthy, he adds.   Omega-3 fats arent the only nutritional reward. ""Fish is a great source of protein that growing bodies need,"" says registered dietitian Sarah Krieger, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Fish also provides varying amounts of iron, calcium, zinc and magnesium, she says.   Variety is a dietitian's mantra, so introduce your kids to a variety of seafood. Here are a few of Krieger's kid-approved dishes.     Make a salad of canned fish with pasta, frozen vegetables and light Italian dressing.    Bake salmon glazed with mustard, honey and reduced-sodium soy sauce.   Have fun with mock sushi. Fill a Romaine lettuce leaf with cooked fish, brown rice, shredded carrots and gingerroot and a splash of reduced-sodium soy sauce.

Food Safety Risks for Pregnant Women and Newborns
",http://www.eatright.org/resource/health/pregnancy/prenatal-wellness/food-safety-risks-for-pregnant-women-and-newborns,"Food Safety Risks for Pregnant Women and Newborns       Published January 31, 2014           Print   Email                March is  National Nutrition Month , when the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reminds everyone to return to the basics of healthy eating. It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    During pregnancy, women and their unborn children are more likely to become very ill from food poisoning. Newborns and infants also are at risk because their immune systems are not fully developed. Infections from foodborne illness can be difficult to treat and can recur in these groups. Use the following rules to reduce risk of harm to mother and her unborn child .   Wash Hands Often   It seems so simple, but it really does work. Proper hand washing may eliminate nearly half of all potential cases of foodborne illness. It also significantly reduces the spread of the common cold and flu. Remember: wash your hands before, during and after meal preparation. Use warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds. And use a clean, dry towel to dry your hands.   Practice Good Refrigerator Safety Habits   First, make sure your refrigerator works. Set it cooler than 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Use a refrigerator thermometer and check it regularly.   Then, use your refrigerator properly. Put perishable foods in the refrigerator as soon as you get home from the store. Refrigerate leftovers within two hours. When outdoor temperatures reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer, refrigerate leftovers within one hour. Store foods in small, shallow containers (2 inches deep or less). Discard opened packages of luncheon meats or spreads after three to five days. Eat foods by the ""use-by"" date on the package. If that date has passed, throw it away.   Thaw frozen foods in the refrigerator, under cold running water or in the microwave right before cooking. Do not leave frozen foods on the counter or in the sink to thaw.   Keep Raw Meats and Ready-to-Eat Foods Separate   Prevent cross-contamination by keeping raw foods separate from ready-to-eat foods. Use two cuttings boards: one strictly for raw meat, poultry and seafood; the other for ready-to-eat foods like breads and vegetables. Wash cutting boards thoroughly in hot, soapy water after each use or place in dishwasher. Discard old cutting boards that have cracks, crevices and knife scars.   Cook to Proper Temperatures   Proper cooking temperatures kill harmful bacteria present in food. Always use a meat thermometer to check the doneness of meat, poultry, seafood and dishes containing eggs. Use the following quick internal temperature guide:      Beef, veal, pork, lamb: 145 degrees Fahrenheit (then, allow to rest three minutes before carving or consuming)   Poultry: 165 degrees    Ground beef, veal, pork, lamb: 160 degrees    Ground poultry: 165 degrees    Casseroles, egg dishes: 160 degrees    Finfish: 145 degrees or until opaque flesh flakes with a fork   Scallops: cook until flesh is milky white or opaque and firm   Shrimp, lobster and crab: cook until flesh is pearly and opaque   Clams, oysters and mussels: cook until shells open during cooking   Leftovers: reheat to at least 165 degrees   Deli-style meats and hotdogs: reheat until steaming hot   Soups, gravies and sauces: bring to boil    Meat marinade: boil for several minutes if you plan to re-use it.   Eggs: whether boiling, frying or scrambling, make sure the yolks and whites are firm, not runny     Foods to Avoid   In addition to keeping good food safety habits, there are certain foods that pregnant women should  not  eat:     Rare, raw or undercooked meats and poultry (rare hamburgers, carpaccio and beef or steak tartare)   Raw fish (including sushi, sashimi, ceviche and carpaccio)   Undercooked and raw shellfish (clams, oysters, mussels and scallops)   Fish containing high levels of mercury (swordfish, tilefish, king mackerel and shark)   Refrigerated smoked seafood, unless it is in a cooked dish, such as a casserole.   Unpasteurized dairy products (""raw"" milk and cheeses)   Some fresh soft cheeses (Brie, Camembert, blue-veined varieties and Mexican-style queso fresco) unless made with pasteurized milk   Raw or undercooked eggs (soft-cooked, runny or poached)   Food items that contain undercooked eggs (unpasteurized eggnog, Monte Cristo sandwiches, French toast, homemade Caesar salad dressing, Hollandaise sauce, some puddings and custards, chocolate mousse, tiramisu and raw cookie dough or cake batter)   Raw sprouts (alfalfa, clover and radish)   Deli salads   Unpasteurized fruit and vegetable juices   Refrigerated pate or meat spreads     Some ready-to-eat foods require reheating before use. These foods include hot dogs, luncheon and deli meats and fermented and dry sausages. Throw away packaged items once the ""use-by"" date has passed.   If you think you have contracted a foodborne illness, contact your health-care provider.

A Healthy Start to Reduce Childhood Obesity

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    A mother's food and nutrition choices before and during pregnancy can greatly contribute to the future health of her children. Women living a healthy lifestyle deliver children with fewer birth defects and chronic health problems. So what makes a lifestyle ""healthy?"" For pregnant women, key habits include eating a variety of foods, ensuring adequate intake of vitamins and minerals, gaining an appropriate amount of weight, participating in regular physical activity and avoiding harmful substances.   Once the baby has arrived, it is important that newborns receive optimal nutrition from the beginning. Studies have shown that breast-feeding provides many advantages to both baby and mother  in terms of health benefits and financial savings. In addition to eating right from birth, developing physical activity habits at an early ageis also important. Active young children are better prepared for life than those who spend childhood sedentary in front of a television or video game screen.   Eating Right during Pregnancy   Moms-to-be need a variety of foods from all the  MyPlate  food groups to get the nutrition needed for a healthy pregnancy. Pregnant women need a balanced diet including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, low-fat dairy and healthful fats. A prenatal multivitamin/mineral supplement may be recommended by your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist to ensure that you get enough iron, folic acid and other nutrients. Safe food practices are important, too, since pregnant women are at higher risk of food poisoning.   Healthy Weight Gain during Pregnancy   While pregnancy is not the time to lose weight, women should not use their expanding bellies as an excuse to eat more than is necessary. The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite.   Many women start off pregnancy overweight or obese; many gain more weight than is healthy during their pregnancy. Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy is risky for both mother and child.   Breast-feeding Benefits   For optimal nutrition for your infant, the Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticsrecommends exclusively breast-feeding for the first six months to provide optimal nutrition and health protection, and continuing breast-feeding with the addition of complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12 months of age.   In addition to providing the best nutrition, breast-feeding reduces your baby's risk of ear infections, respiratory illnesses, gastrointestinal infections and possibly sudden infant death syndrome and obesity. Breast-feeding also provides mom with benefits including aiding in weight loss after delivery and reducing risk of breast and ovarian cancers.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Even if you're struggling to pay your bills, there are resources available to help you and your family eat nutritious meals. ""Poor nutrition can impair health and immunity, lower productivity, and hinder development and learning,"" says Alison Kaufman, MS, RD, LDN, Director of Hunger and Nutrition at the Jewish Family & Children's Service of Greater Boston.   If you're finding it difficult to put healthy food on the table, these resources can help.     Get to know SNAP.  Formerly known as Food Stamps, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) can provide additional monthly assistance to buy foods such as fruit, vegetables, bread, cereal, meat, fish, poultry and milk. SNAP dollars aren't limited to your local grocery store. Monthly benefits, provided in the form of a debit card, can also be used at convenience and specialty stores.   Visit your local farmers market.  If your neighborhood doesn't have a local supermarket, you may think it's impossible to find fresh fruits and vegetables. Farmers markets are  sprouting up in many underserved neighborhoods . These markets provide fresh, locally grown produce that you can often purchase with SNAP dollars. And there's another perk: ""Many states will give double dollars for SNAP participants who use farmers markets. So $10 in SNAP benefits will get you $20 in produce,"" says Mary Flynn, PhD, RD, LDN, an associate professor of medicine at Brown University.   If you have children under age 5, check out WIC.  WIC, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, provides supplemental foods, health care referrals, nutrition education and breast-feeding promotion and support to low-income pregnant, breast-feeding and postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age 5 who are at risk for poor nutrition.  If you're eligible , you'll receive foods to meet your unique nutrition requirements as well as those of your young children. WIC foods include iron-fortified cereal, whole-wheat bread, eggs, milk, cheese, beans, peanut butter, canned fish, fruits and vegetables and vitamin C-rich fruit juice. WIC can also provide foods for your baby including baby food and iron-fortified infant cereal and iron-fortified infant formula.   Take advantage of school meals.  Depending on your family's income level, your child may qualify for free or reduced cost breakfast and lunch at school through the National School Breakfast and National School Lunch Programs. Thanks to the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, school meals are healthier than ever, serving up more lean meat, low-fat dairy, whole grains and fruits and vegetables. And good nutrition doesnt necessarily take a break when school lets out. The Afterschool Meal Program may provide snacks or dinner to children in eligible school programs. ""For children with parents that work shifts during the evening meal, dinner programs provide many children with the only food they will have access to after school,"" says Flynn. Even when school isnt in session, the Summer Food Service Program provides nutritious meals to fill the void.     The following websites provide additional information about these programs.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Triglycerides matter. Why? Most importantly, high levels of fat in the blood in the form of triglycerides can increase your risk for heart disease. Luckily, the same dietary recommendations that are advised for a number of other conditions  such as losing weight and lowering blood cholesterol  can also help lower triglycerides. When excess calories are eaten, triglycerides are formed and stored for the body to use at a later time. However, some people have triglyceride levels that increase their risk of heart disease. According to the American Heart Association (AHA), a normal triglyceride level is below 150 mg/dL and a level above 200 mg/dL is high. For many, a healthy level can be achieved through lifestyle changes such as following a heart-healthy diet, losing weight and increasing physical activity.   A Heart-Healthy Eating Plan   Your healthy eating plan should be moderate in carbohydrate foods such as whole-grain breads, cereals and pasta. Include fewer foods with added sugars such as desserts, baked goods and sugar-sweetened beverages. Try substituting with calorie-free beverages and choosing smaller portions of candy and desserts.   Additional recommendations from the AHA include following a Mediterranean-style diet by eating more fruits, vegetables, whole grains and seafood while limiting saturated fat, trans fat, added sugars and alcohol. This eating pattern includes a moderate amount of healthy monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats found in oils such as canola and olive oils.   According to the  Dietary Guidelines , Americans need to eat more seafood to help prevent heart disease. Seafood has a range of nutrients and is high in omega-3 fatty acids. It is easy to get enough omega-3 fatty acids by eating fish regularly.  Just 2 servings of seafood per week (about 8 ounces total) will provide the recommended amount of omega-3 fatty acids.    Seafood high in omega-3 fatty acids include salmon, Atlantic herring, Atlantic mackerel, farmed rainbow trout, white tuna and halibut. Note: Pregnant and nursing women and young children should avoid shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish, which contain high levels of mercury. Albacore tuna has more mercury than canned light tuna, and should be limited to no more than 6 ounces per week.   Omega-3 Supplements   High doses of supplemental omega-3 fatty acids have been shown to lower triglycerides in patients with high triglycerides (greater than 200 mg/dL). However, this should only be done under the advice and supervision of a doctor.   If your triglyceride level is above 150 mg/dL, discuss lifestyle changes and the potential advantage of taking supplements with your doctor and registered dietitian nutritionist. An RDN can help develop a healthy eating plan that meets your personal health needs and lifestyle.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Eating the same way in your 40s as you did in your 20s? Ignoring your nutritional needs when you're 60? Not you! Build your best, healthiest body by adjusting your diet and eating habits to address the specific needs of each decade.   20s: Bone Building   In your 20s, you're still building up bone density, so this is the decade to help your bones grow strong and healthy. ""You really want to make those bones as dense as you can while you're young, during those bone-growing years,"" says registered dietitian nutritionist Ruth Frechman. She calls it ""filling the bank"" because in later years, your body will lose some of that bone, so the more you start with the better off you are.   Enter calcium, which not only builds strong bones but is also important for healthy muscles, nerves and heart. You need 1,000 milligrams per day, so enjoy dairy products, opt for calcium-fortified orange juice and cereals, and load up on beans, leafy greens, almonds and canned salmon with bones.   Young women don't need to pass up dairy products for fear of gaining weight. Instead choose fat-free or low-fat milk and yogurt, reduced-fat cheese and for a sweet treat pick fat-free calcium-fortified hot cocoa, says Frechman.   30s: Baby on Board   These days, women are having babies well into their 30s, which makes folic acid an important nutrient during this decade. Folic acid helps prevent neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida. Unfortunately, ""Many studies have shown that folic acid is one of those nutrients that we tend to run low in,"" says Jeannie Moloo, RD.   For women who plan on becoming pregnant, the 2010  Dietary Guidelines  recommend consuming 400 micrograms per day of folic acid from fortified foods and/or supplements, in addition to foods high in folate. Many breads, cereals and grain products are fortified with folic acid; fruits and vegetables are good sources of folate. If you're trying to get pregnant, your doctor may recommend a folic acid supplement.    Moloo also calls the 30s the ""prevention decade,"" meaning, if you haven't already, it's time to start thinking about how to prevent chronic diseases that become more prevalent as we age.    Look to foods containing healthy fats such as omega-3 fats and monounsaturated fats.     Found in nuts, olive and canola oils and avocados, monounsaturated fats improve blood cholesterol levels, which can decrease your risk of heart disease, and they may help with keeping blood sugar levels in check (potentially helpful for appetite control and reducing the risk for diabetes). A few studies have looked at monounsaturated fats as being beneficial for specifically reducing belly fat, but firm findings are lacking.   Scientists believe omega-3 fats (found in fish) may influence how fat is used and stored in the body. It's possible omega-3s push fat more toward energy use than to storage in your body. Omega-3s may help reduce body fat with or without cutting calories. Animal studies have supported the theory; human studies are encouraging, but not as conclusive. Add exercise on top of upping omega-3s and you can lose more body fat.     40s: Keeping Score   If you haven't been treating your body right, the 40s is where this will start showing up. ""You are starting the aging process,"" says Frechman. ""So you really want to make sure you're in tip-top shape.""   The 40s are a good time to be vigilant about eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. They're packed with vitamins, minerals, fiber and phytonutrients plus low in fat and calories. Adults need at least 2 cups of fruit and 2 cups of vegetables a day. Explore new tastes by trying a new fruit or vegetable a couple of times a month.   Try snacking on fruit including apples, bananas and clementines, opt for vegetable-packed, broth-based soups, salads piled with greens and smoothies with berries. If you don't like the taste of vegetables raw, try roasting them which makes them sweeter.   Another important nutrient for the 40-and-over set is fiber, which can help protect against heart disease and some types of cancer. Women under 50 need 25 grams per day, but most adults get only about half that amount. Luckily, the fruits and veggies you're eating for the vitamins and minerals are also rich in fiber, and whole grains and beans are other good sources.   50s: Calorie Counting   The 50s are a time of big changes thanks to perimenopause and menopause. ""Hormone fluctuations can be very dramatic, and with hormone fluctuations can come changes in metabolism,"" says Moloo. ""It's a time when women tend to have weight creep on, and it's that very metabolically active fat around the middle, which has been shown to drive diabetes and other health-related issues."" So Moloo suggests decreasing calorie intake and increasing activity levels if you start to experience weight gain.   Also essential: Vitamin D is used in every cell in the body, says Frechman. It's essential for bone health and researchers believe it may reduce the risk of some cancers, heart disease and infectious diseases. Vitamin D is difficult to get from food  the best sources are fortified milk, orange juice and cereals, as well as fish such as salmon and tuna.   The recommended daily amount of vitamin D recently increased to 600 IU per day for women ages 19 to 70, but the majority of adults don't get enough. Consult your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist about your need for a supplement.   60s and Beyond: Protein Power   Protein, along with regular strength building exercise, is essential for maintaining muscle, which we tend to lose as we age. Consuming enough protein may also be linked with bone health.   The average woman needs about 5 to 6 ounces of protein foods each day. Good sources include meat such as beef, chicken, fish, pork and lamb. Not a meat eater? You'll also find protein in eggs, beans, tofu and nuts, as well as low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt and cheese.   Vitamin B12 which helps your body make red blood cells and keep the brain and nervous system healthy  is another vital nutrient for women over 60. You can get B12 through any food that comes from an animal: meat, fish, dairy products and eggs. However, as people get older they can develop a reduced ability to absorb vitamin B12, says Frechman. She recommends talking to your doctor to see if you need a supplement.   Each decade brings with it specific health concerns and different nutrition needs. Eat right for your age and you'll sail through the decades feeling great.         Reviewed February 2015         Tags     Health   Wellness   Preventing Illness   For Women"

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    A condition that affects how your body uses energy in the form of glucose from food, diabetes can be successfully managed through proper self-monitoring, medication and lifestyle changes. People with diabetes have a high level of glucose in their blood, which can be caused by either too little insulin being produced by the pancreas or the body not accepting or using the insulin it produces, or a combination of both.   People with diabetes need to keep their blood sugar levels within a healthy range. Blood sugar levels are controlled through diet, physical activity and, for some people, a combination of medication and insulin injections.   Understanding Insulin   Insulin is a hormone your cells need to store and use energy from food, and it is responsible for getting glucose into your cells. If you have diabetes, insulin is not able to do its job. Meaning, glucose is unable to get into your cells, which causes it to build up in your blood. High levels of glucose then circulate through your body, damaging cells along the way.   Types of Diabetes     Type 1 Diabetes:  An autoimmune disease in which the pancreas cannot make insulin or makes very little. Type 1 diabetes often begins in childhood (it was previously known as ""juvenile diabetes""), and the onset is sudden. People with Type 1 diabetes need daily insulin injections or an insulin pump. Just 5% of people with diabetes have Type 1 diabetes, which cannot be prevented through diet or lifestyle.   Type 2 Diabetes:  A chronic disease in which the pancreas makes insulin, but it does not make enough or the body doesn't use the insulin it makes and usually develops slowly. Eight in 10 people with this type of diabetes are overweight. In fact, Type 2 diabetes is becoming more common in children and teenagers because of the increase in obesity within these age groups. Blood sugar levels are controlled through diet and physical activity. Oral medicines may be used to help the body respond to the insulin it makes. Insulin injections or a pump also may be needed.   Gestational Diabetes:  The cause is unknown but may be the result of hormones during pregnancy blocking the action of insulin. Gestational diabetes often disappears after the baby is born. However, women who experience diabetes while pregnant have a much greater chance of having Type 2 diabetes later in life.     Signs and Symptoms of Diabetes   Common symptoms of diabetes include:     Urinating frequently   Being unusually thirsty   Losing weight   Feeling tired   Irritability   Blurred vision   Frequent illness or infection   Poor circulation, such as tingling or numbness in the feet or hands     If you think you have diabetes, see a doctor immediately. Only a doctor can confirm a diabetes diagnosis and will most likely recommend one of these blood tests:      Fasting Plasma Glucose: The amount of glucose in a sample of blood taken when a person is fasting (not eating anything for eight to 12 hours; usually overnight).   HbA1C: This measures a person's average blood glucose range over the past two to three months. This test shows the amount of glucose that sticks to the red blood cell (hemoglobin; Hb).   Oral Glucose Tolerance Test: Results of this test are compared with standard non-diabetic results and show how the body uses glucose over time. This test is performed by a health care professional after an overnight fast. A blood sample is taken, the patient drinks a high-glucose beverage and then a blood sample is taken two hours later.     Goals for Managing Diabetes   Whether you have been diagnosed with Type 1, Type 2 or gestational diabetes, your overall goals for managing the disease are similar.     Keep blood glucose levels within the target range determined by your doctor. This can prevent or reduce complications.   Reduce your risk of heart disease and stroke, since people with diabetes are at risk for both. Keep blood pressure under control and achieve healthy cholesterol levels.   Adopt a healthful eating pattern and lifestyle that are enjoyable and doable for you and can help prevent, or at least slow, complications from diabetes.     Managing Blood Glucose Levels   People with diabetes need to keep their blood glucose levels within a healthy range. The American Diabetes Association recommends the following range:     80 to 130 mg/dl (before a meal)   <180 mg/dl (1 to 2 hours after beginning a meal)   HbA1c 7% (average glucose over 3 months)    For some people, medication or insulin injections are needed to help manage the relationship between glucose and insulin. However, action can be taken to control blood glucose levels including eating right, getting physical activity and weight management.  To successfully manage diabetes, you need to understand how foods and nutrition affect your body. If you have been diagnosed with diabetes, seek the expert advice of a  registered dietitian nutritionist  to help you manage the disease while ensuring you get the nutrients your body needs.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.            It seems everyone is talking about ""detox"" or considering a ""cleanse."" Toxins are said to be the problem, but when was the last time anyone explained what a detox, toxin or cleanse actually are?    How the Body Naturally Detoxifies   Detoxification is a process that the body performs around the clock utilizing important nutrients from the diet. It's the process that transforms molecules that need to be removed from the body, or ""toxins."" They fall into two main categories: molecules that are made in the body as byproducts of regular metabolism (endotoxins), and those that come from outside the body and are introduced to the system by eating, drinking, breathing or are absorbed through the skin (exotoxins).   Endotoxins include compounds such as lactic acid, urea and waste products from microbes in the gut. Exotoxins include environmental toxins and pollutants, pesticides, mercury in seafood, lead from car exhaust and air pollution, chemicals in tobacco smoke, dioxin in feminine care products, phthalates from plastic and parabens from lotions and cosmetics.   Detoxification is also the process by which medications are metabolized, then excreted. Because toxins are potentially dangerous to human health, they need to be transformed and excreted from the body through urine, feces, respiration or sweat. Each person's ability to detoxify varies and is influenced by environment, diet, lifestyle, health status and genetic factors, suggesting some people could require more detoxification support than others. But if the amount of toxin to which a person is exposed exceeds his or her body's ability to excrete them, the toxins may be stored in fat cells, soft tissue and bone, negatively affecting health. This is the rationale that supports the use of practices that support the body's own detoxification capabilities.    Most detoxification programs recommend removing processed foods and foods to which some people are sensitive, such as dairy, gluten, eggs, peanuts and red meat, and eating mostly organically grown vegetables, fruit, whole nonglutenous grains, nuts, seeds and lean protein. Other programs recommend fasting, a potentially risky practice for some people, which may actually suppress detoxification pathways in the body. This is why many health practitioners advise against this practice.    Many noncredentialed people claim to be experts in detoxification, and many seasoned health professionals are not well versed in detoxification protocols. Because detoxification programs can vary widely and may pose a risk for some people (such as people with multiple maladies, those who take multiple medications and pregnant or breast-feeding women), it is important to work with a credentialed health professional who understands your health status and goals and who is able to evaluate detoxification programs for safety and effectiveness. Consider working with an integrative and functional medicine dietitian.    9 Ways to Support Your Body's Natural Detox   Detoxification support doesn't need to consist of a rigorous plan; doing some or all of the following can support detoxification:     Maintain adequate hydration with clean water.   Eat five to nine servings of fruit and vegetables per day.   Consume enough fiber each day from vegetables, nuts, seeds and whole grains.   Eat cruciferous vegetables, berries, artichokes, garlic, onions, leeks, turmeric and milk thistle, and drink green tea. These foods support detoxification pathways.   Consume adequate protein, which is critical to maintaining optimum levels of glutathione, the body's master detoxification enzyme.    Consider taking a multivitamin/multimineral to fill any gaps in a healthy diet, since certain vitamins and minerals enable the body's detoxification processes to function.   Eat naturally fermented foods such as kefir, yogurt, kimchi and sauerkraut  or take a high-quality probiotic  to help the body manage toxins from microbes that live in the gut.   N-acetylcysteine (NAC), a precursor to glutathione (the body's master detoxification enzyme), is often recommended to support the body's natural detoxification activity.    Maintain bowel regularity.     If you are in good health and are interested in a detoxification program, check in with a registered dietitian nutritionist or physician who understands the body's detox capabilities, can help evaluate different products and programs and recommend a plan that works for you. Practitioners trained in integrative and functional nutrition and medicine are well-trained in safe detoxification protocols and can be a wealth of information.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    People have been eating raw seafood from the beginning of time. But does that mean we should be doing so now?   Our planet has changed over the centuries. Modern conveniences have led to the polluting of our environment  and that includes our open oceans, lakes, seas, rivers and streams. Most of the fish we consume are from these bodies of water, so environmental contamination is one issue to consider when selecting seafood. One contaminant of particular concern is methylmercury, which is found in varying levels in fish and shellfish  whether cooked or raw. Refer to the  Environmental Protection Agency and Food and Drug Administration  for advice about mercury in fish and shellfish.   Raw Seafood and Food Poisoning    Besides methylmercury, there are additional concerns if you plan to eat raw seafood. For most healthy people, eating reasonable amounts of raw seafood poses only a small health risk. Nonetheless, there is a risk for everyone. Foodborne illness can be the result, potentially causing severe vomiting, diarrhea and abdominal pain, among other symptoms.   Major types of food poisoning that can result from eating raw or undercooked fish and shellfish include Salmonella and Vibrio vulnificus. For raw shellfish connoisseurs, especially raw oyster lovers, you specifically need to know about the risk for Vibrio infections. Vibrio vulnificus is a bacterium that lives in warm seawater and is not caused by pollution. While not common, these infections were 43 percent higher in 2012 compared with 20062008, according to 2012 FoodNet data.   To prevent any type of food poisoning, know that neither hot sauce nor alcohol kills bacteria, despite popular myth. The best rule of thumb is to follow good food safety practices and properly cook all seafood. Prepare fin fish until it reaches 145F  or until the flesh is opaque and separates easily with a fork; prepare shellfish until the flesh is opaque; or, for clams, oysters, and mussels, until the shells open.   One other safety tip of interest: If you do decide to eat raw fish, choose fish that has been previously frozen. That's because freezing will kill any potential parasites present. Unfortunately, freezing doesn't kill every harmful organism.   High-Risk Individuals   For people at high-risk for foodborne illness, severe and life-threatening illness may result from consuming raw or undercooked fish and shellfish. These individuals include those with compromised immune systems or with decreased stomach acidity, as well as pregnant women, infants, young children and older adults. Raw fish and shellfish consumption is never advised for high-risk individuals. If you're in this category, thoroughly cook fish and shellfish. If unsure of risk level, consult with your physician or registered dietitian nutritionist.   Keeping it Safe: from Market to Mealtime   Follow these key tips when buying, storing and preparing fresh, raw seafood.   At the market:     Be sure fresh seafood is properly refrigerated below 40F or well-packed with ice.   Look for fish with shiny, firm flesh and no overly ""fishy"" odor.     In your fridge:     Keep fresh fish well wrapped or in air-tight containers for no more than two days.   Store fresh, pasteurized or smoked seafood between 32F and 38F; store live clams, crabs, crayfish, lobsters, mussels and oysters in well ventilated containers.     During preparation:     Keep raw and cooked seafood separate, including using separate cutting boards.   Wash hands, cutting boards, plates and utensils thoroughly between handling raw seafood and any ready-to-eat food.     Dining Out Advice   There are a plethora of well-liked raw and undercooked fish and shellfish items on menus today. For healthy individuals, these foods can generally be consumed safely when they're from reputable restaurants or markets that use fresh, high-quality ingredients and follow proper food safety practices. But be aware of these menu items, especially if youre in the high-risk category, since they contain raw or undercooked seafood: sushi, sashimi, raw oysters or clams on the half shell, ceviche, crudo, gravlax, poke, tuna tartare and tuna carpaccio.   The Bottom Line   In general, the health benefits associated with eating a variety of properly cooked fish and shellfish outweigh risks in healthy individuals. However, the same does not apply to raw fish and shellfish. Be aware of food safety considerations when eating it. And if you're a high-risk individual, simply do not eat raw seafood.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Each year millions of people become sick from pathogenic parasites, bacteria, chemicals or toxins from contaminated food or water. These can cause more than 200 diseases, ranging from diarrhea to cancer. Children, the elderly, pregnant women and people with lowered immunity are at greatest risk of getting sick.   That's why this year's World Health Day focus  food safety  is so important. Celebrated every year on April 7, World Health Day commemorates the anniversary of the founding of the World Health Organization (WHO).   Being knowledgeable about safe food preparation lowers your risk of food poisoning and can help keep you healthy. Here are five things you can do to make sure your food is safe.   Keep it Clean   Wash hands before any food prep and again after handling raw meat or poultry, after touching your face or hair and after sneezing, coughing or using the bathroom. Blenders, rubber spatulas, can openers and reusable containers can all harbor pathogens in their nooks and crannies. Thoroughly dismantle and clean each piece and then allow to dry completely. You might also consider swapping your kitchen sponge for a washcloth that can be laundered regularly. And while no one loves cleaning out the fridge, you should give your fridge a deep clean every few weeks. Not only does this remove potentially hazardous residue from raw meat or poultry or soil from vegetables, but it also prevents keeping spoiled leftovers that can make you sick.   Separate Raw and Cooked Food   Put ready-to-eat foods at the top of the fridge. Raw meat and poultry should be placed at the bottom of the fridge where the risk of bacteria-laden juices dripping onto other foods are minimized. Store food in containers or wrapped with plastic to prevent cross contamination, and label and date foods to keep track of their freshness.   Cook Thoroughly   The best tool for food safety is an accurate thermometer. Color is not a reliable indicator of adequate cooking: One out of every four hamburgers turns brown before it's been cooked to a safe internal temperature. To assess the temperature, insert thermometers into the thickest part of the meat and avoid bones and the bottom of the pan as this will give a false temperature reading. Clean the thermometer between uses with an alcohol swab. And always reheat leftovers until they're piping hot.   Keep Food at Safe Temperatures   When grocery shopping, pick out your cold and frozen foods last. If shopping on a hot day, keep food in a cooler for the ride home. When it's time to thaw frozen foods, do so in the fridge, not on the counter. Keep hot foods piping hot until serving and keep cold foods very cold. Foods that are lukewarm may be in the temperature ""danger zone,"" the temperature range at which microbes can multiply very quickly.   Use Safe Water and Raw Materials   Have you ever thought about what might be lingering in your water filters? Clean coffee makers, refrigerator water dispensers and water filters with a 50-50 water and white vinegar solution to avoid mold buildup. When it comes to raw foods, purchase from reliable vendors and wash fruits and vegetables prior to chopping and eating.   Food safety is important for all of us. If ever you are not certain that a food is safe, don't eat it! Remember: If in doubt, throw it out.   For more information on food safety today and every day, visit  HomeFoodSafety.org .

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    The United States' food supply is affordable, plentiful and one of the safest in the world  but it is not completely risk-free. From farm to fork, food safety is a top priority and many traditional food processing methods help minimize food safety risks, including canning, freezing, drying, irradiation and pasteurization. These methods preserve food and destroy bacteria that cause food poisoning, helping to keep food safe. Let's take a closer looks at these methods.   Canning   In your cupboard, you may find canned tuna, canned vegetables or even foods you canned yourself. The canning process has been a safe way to preserve food for 200 years. The food quality and nutrient content of canned goods remain relatively stable as long as the container and seal are intact, allowing for a long shelf life. Another safety advantage of canned foods is that they are tamper-resistant  any opening is clearly evident.   Canning is simply cooking food at high temperatures in a sealed and sterile can or jar, which destroys organisms that would cause spoilage  no need for preservatives. In addition, canning removes nearly all pesticide residues during the washing and peeling steps of the commercial canning process. Some nutrients can be lost during the heating process, but canned foods are as nutritious as fresh and frozen foods, and can even be more nutritious than fresh or frozen foods when handled improperly. Canned products are convenient, portable and quick to prepare. Just reheat since they are already cooked during the canning process.   Note: Salt or added sugars are only used to enhance the flavor in canned foods, not as a preservative, so look for cans with no added salt.   Freezing   Freezing is an excellent way to preserve foods such as vegetables, meat or fish for a very long time. You can freeze almost any food, with the exception of canned food and eggs in the shell. Freezing keeps food safe almost indefinitely, so the recommended storage times are for quality alone. So what does freezing actually do?   Freezing is a food processing method that prevents the growth of bacteria, yeasts and molds that cause food spoilage and food poisoning. This method keeps food safe by storing perishable food well below the temperature at which harmful microorganisms thrive and keeps foods out of the danger zone, between 40F and 140F. Freezing also helps retain the nutrition and quality of foods for a longer period of time.    Drying   Among the oldest methods of preserving food, the drying process removes moisture makingperishable foodssafe without refrigeration. Common dried foods include fruit, vegetables, beans and nuts, or even fish, meat and poultry.    Drying removes the moisture from foods, leaving bacteria without a key ingredient to grow - water. Dried foods can remain safe in dry, covered conditions at room or cool temperatures. A preservative is generally used to keep dried protein-rich foods like meat, seafood and poultry safe.   Pasteurization   Pasteurization is the process of heating foods such as raw milk, raw eggs and fresh juice to a temperature high enough to destroy bacteria and inactivate most enzymes that cause spoilage. Milk, eggs, soft cheeses and juice are commonly pasteurized to kill harmful bacteria. Unpasteurized products can be harmful to everyone, but those at high risk of food poisoning (pregnant women, older adults, young children and those with weakened immune systems) should especially avoid any unpasteurized products.   Irradiation   Irradiation is used on wheat, flour, fruits, vegetables, spices, seafood, beans, shelled eggs, raw poultry and red meats to control spoilage and eliminate foodborne pathogens.   Irradiation destroys bacteria, mold, fungi and insects by passing a field of radiant energy through food, similar to how sunlight passes through a window. Often referred to as cold pasteurization, irradiation uses no heat to destroy disease-causing bacteria and other organisms. Irradiation extends the freshness of food and helps retain quality and safety longer. Like other processing methods, irradiation is regulated and approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Whole foods that have been irradiated must be labeled.   While these food processing methods play a key role in keeping our food safe, these methods cannot replace safe food handling practices in the home. Always remember the four easy steps  wash, separate, cook and refrigerate and be sure to store, prepare and cook food in a safe manner.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Even if you're struggling to pay your bills, there are resources available to help you and your family eat nutritious meals. ""Poor nutrition can impair health and immunity, lower productivity, and hinder development and learning,"" says Alison Kaufman, MS, RD, LDN, Director of Hunger and Nutrition at the Jewish Family & Children's Service of Greater Boston.   If you're finding it difficult to put healthy food on the table, these resources can help.     Get to know SNAP.  Formerly known as Food Stamps, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) can provide additional monthly assistance to buy foods such as fruit, vegetables, bread, cereal, meat, fish, poultry and milk. SNAP dollars aren't limited to your local grocery store. Monthly benefits, provided in the form of a debit card, can also be used at convenience and specialty stores.   Visit your local farmers market.  If your neighborhood doesn't have a local supermarket, you may think it's impossible to find fresh fruits and vegetables. Farmers markets are  sprouting up in many underserved neighborhoods . These markets provide fresh, locally grown produce that you can often purchase with SNAP dollars. And there's another perk: ""Many states will give double dollars for SNAP participants who use farmers markets. So $10 in SNAP benefits will get you $20 in produce,"" says Mary Flynn, PhD, RD, LDN, an associate professor of medicine at Brown University.   If you have children under age 5, check out WIC.  WIC, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, provides supplemental foods, health care referrals, nutrition education and breast-feeding promotion and support to low-income pregnant, breast-feeding and postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age 5 who are at risk for poor nutrition.  If you're eligible , you'll receive foods to meet your unique nutrition requirements as well as those of your young children. WIC foods include iron-fortified cereal, whole-wheat bread, eggs, milk, cheese, beans, peanut butter, canned fish, fruits and vegetables and vitamin C-rich fruit juice. WIC can also provide foods for your baby including baby food and iron-fortified infant cereal and iron-fortified infant formula.   Take advantage of school meals.  Depending on your family's income level, your child may qualify for free or reduced cost breakfast and lunch at school through the National School Breakfast and National School Lunch Programs. Thanks to the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, school meals are healthier than ever, serving up more lean meat, low-fat dairy, whole grains and fruits and vegetables. And good nutrition doesnt necessarily take a break when school lets out. The Afterschool Meal Program may provide snacks or dinner to children in eligible school programs. ""For children with parents that work shifts during the evening meal, dinner programs provide many children with the only food they will have access to after school,"" says Flynn. Even when school isnt in session, the Summer Food Service Program provides nutritious meals to fill the void.     The following websites provide additional information about these programs.

Food Safety Risks for Pregnant Women and Newborns
",http://www.eatright.org/resource/health/pregnancy/prenatal-wellness/food-safety-risks-for-pregnant-women-and-newborns,"Food Safety Risks for Pregnant Women and Newborns       Published January 31, 2014           Print   Email                March is  National Nutrition Month , when the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reminds everyone to return to the basics of healthy eating. It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    During pregnancy, women and their unborn children are more likely to become very ill from food poisoning. Newborns and infants also are at risk because their immune systems are not fully developed. Infections from foodborne illness can be difficult to treat and can recur in these groups. Use the following rules to reduce risk of harm to mother and her unborn child .   Wash Hands Often   It seems so simple, but it really does work. Proper hand washing may eliminate nearly half of all potential cases of foodborne illness. It also significantly reduces the spread of the common cold and flu. Remember: wash your hands before, during and after meal preparation. Use warm, soapy water for at least 20 seconds. And use a clean, dry towel to dry your hands.   Practice Good Refrigerator Safety Habits   First, make sure your refrigerator works. Set it cooler than 40 degrees Fahrenheit. Use a refrigerator thermometer and check it regularly.   Then, use your refrigerator properly. Put perishable foods in the refrigerator as soon as you get home from the store. Refrigerate leftovers within two hours. When outdoor temperatures reach 90 degrees Fahrenheit or warmer, refrigerate leftovers within one hour. Store foods in small, shallow containers (2 inches deep or less). Discard opened packages of luncheon meats or spreads after three to five days. Eat foods by the ""use-by"" date on the package. If that date has passed, throw it away.   Thaw frozen foods in the refrigerator, under cold running water or in the microwave right before cooking. Do not leave frozen foods on the counter or in the sink to thaw.   Keep Raw Meats and Ready-to-Eat Foods Separate   Prevent cross-contamination by keeping raw foods separate from ready-to-eat foods. Use two cuttings boards: one strictly for raw meat, poultry and seafood; the other for ready-to-eat foods like breads and vegetables. Wash cutting boards thoroughly in hot, soapy water after each use or place in dishwasher. Discard old cutting boards that have cracks, crevices and knife scars.   Cook to Proper Temperatures   Proper cooking temperatures kill harmful bacteria present in food. Always use a meat thermometer to check the doneness of meat, poultry, seafood and dishes containing eggs. Use the following quick internal temperature guide:      Beef, veal, pork, lamb: 145 degrees Fahrenheit (then, allow to rest three minutes before carving or consuming)   Poultry: 165 degrees    Ground beef, veal, pork, lamb: 160 degrees    Ground poultry: 165 degrees    Casseroles, egg dishes: 160 degrees    Finfish: 145 degrees or until opaque flesh flakes with a fork   Scallops: cook until flesh is milky white or opaque and firm   Shrimp, lobster and crab: cook until flesh is pearly and opaque   Clams, oysters and mussels: cook until shells open during cooking   Leftovers: reheat to at least 165 degrees   Deli-style meats and hotdogs: reheat until steaming hot   Soups, gravies and sauces: bring to boil    Meat marinade: boil for several minutes if you plan to re-use it.   Eggs: whether boiling, frying or scrambling, make sure the yolks and whites are firm, not runny     Foods to Avoid   In addition to keeping good food safety habits, there are certain foods that pregnant women should  not  eat:     Rare, raw or undercooked meats and poultry (rare hamburgers, carpaccio and beef or steak tartare)   Raw fish (including sushi, sashimi, ceviche and carpaccio)   Undercooked and raw shellfish (clams, oysters, mussels and scallops)   Fish containing high levels of mercury (swordfish, tilefish, king mackerel and shark)   Refrigerated smoked seafood, unless it is in a cooked dish, such as a casserole.   Unpasteurized dairy products (""raw"" milk and cheeses)   Some fresh soft cheeses (Brie, Camembert, blue-veined varieties and Mexican-style queso fresco) unless made with pasteurized milk   Raw or undercooked eggs (soft-cooked, runny or poached)   Food items that contain undercooked eggs (unpasteurized eggnog, Monte Cristo sandwiches, French toast, homemade Caesar salad dressing, Hollandaise sauce, some puddings and custards, chocolate mousse, tiramisu and raw cookie dough or cake batter)   Raw sprouts (alfalfa, clover and radish)   Deli salads   Unpasteurized fruit and vegetable juices   Refrigerated pate or meat spreads     Some ready-to-eat foods require reheating before use. These foods include hot dogs, luncheon and deli meats and fermented and dry sausages. Throw away packaged items once the ""use-by"" date has passed.   If you think you have contracted a foodborne illness, contact your health-care provider.

A Healthy Start to Reduce Childhood Obesity

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    A mother's food and nutrition choices before and during pregnancy can greatly contribute to the future health of her children. Women living a healthy lifestyle deliver children with fewer birth defects and chronic health problems. So what makes a lifestyle ""healthy?"" For pregnant women, key habits include eating a variety of foods, ensuring adequate intake of vitamins and minerals, gaining an appropriate amount of weight, participating in regular physical activity and avoiding harmful substances.   Once the baby has arrived, it is important that newborns receive optimal nutrition from the beginning. Studies have shown that breast-feeding provides many advantages to both baby and mother  in terms of health benefits and financial savings. In addition to eating right from birth, developing physical activity habits at an early ageis also important. Active young children are better prepared for life than those who spend childhood sedentary in front of a television or video game screen.   Eating Right during Pregnancy   Moms-to-be need a variety of foods from all the  MyPlate  food groups to get the nutrition needed for a healthy pregnancy. Pregnant women need a balanced diet including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, low-fat dairy and healthful fats. A prenatal multivitamin/mineral supplement may be recommended by your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist to ensure that you get enough iron, folic acid and other nutrients. Safe food practices are important, too, since pregnant women are at higher risk of food poisoning.   Healthy Weight Gain during Pregnancy   While pregnancy is not the time to lose weight, women should not use their expanding bellies as an excuse to eat more than is necessary. The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite.   Many women start off pregnancy overweight or obese; many gain more weight than is healthy during their pregnancy. Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy is risky for both mother and child.   Breast-feeding Benefits   For optimal nutrition for your infant, the Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticsrecommends exclusively breast-feeding for the first six months to provide optimal nutrition and health protection, and continuing breast-feeding with the addition of complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12 months of age.   In addition to providing the best nutrition, breast-feeding reduces your baby's risk of ear infections, respiratory illnesses, gastrointestinal infections and possibly sudden infant death syndrome and obesity. Breast-feeding also provides mom with benefits including aiding in weight loss after delivery and reducing risk of breast and ovarian cancers.

Is Fish Healthy for My Child?

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    One fish, two fish, good fish, bad fish.    Parents often wonder if they should feed their children fish. After all, nearly all fish contain trace amounts of methylmercury, an environmental contaminant. In large amounts, all forms of mercury are toxic to nerve cells and can cause vision problems, poor coordination and learning impairments.    When it comes to mercury toxicity, the emphasis is on ""large amounts."" The real danger is not consuming enough fish, says Gary J. Myers, MD, pediatric neurologist at the University of Rochester Medical Center. ""Fish is the primary source of omega-3 fatty acids."" Children need these specialized fats to build the structure of their brains from the time of conception to about age 20, he explains. Without an ample supply of omega-3 fats, the body incorporates other fatty acids which do not confer the same benefits to the brain and nervous system.   So what makes parents leery of fish? In 2004, the Food and Drug Administration and the Environmental Protection Agency jointly issued a warning to children, pregnant women and nursing mothers to limit fish to a couple meals weekly and to completely avoid the four fish with the highest levels of mercury: shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish. Limit albacore ""white"" tuna to just once per week, the report added as it is fifth on the list of high-mercury fish. Confusion spread along with the news. Many people became unnecessarily fearful and shunned all fish including the ever-popular, low-mercury canned light tuna.   The only reported cases of mercury poisoning from eating fish occurred in Japan after massive industrial pollution. There are no reports of mercury poisoning from fish consumption from other areas of the world, says Myers. He has studied the health of children in the Seychelles Islands in the Indian Ocean where fish consumption and mercury exposure are at least 10 times higher than in the U.S. Thousands of measurements suggest the children are very healthy, he adds.   Omega-3 fats arent the only nutritional reward. ""Fish is a great source of protein that growing bodies need,"" says registered dietitian Sarah Krieger, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Fish also provides varying amounts of iron, calcium, zinc and magnesium, she says.   Variety is a dietitian's mantra, so introduce your kids to a variety of seafood. Here are a few of Krieger's kid-approved dishes.     Make a salad of canned fish with pasta, frozen vegetables and light Italian dressing.    Bake salmon glazed with mustard, honey and reduced-sodium soy sauce.   Have fun with mock sushi. Fill a Romaine lettuce leaf with cooked fish, brown rice, shredded carrots and gingerroot and a splash of reduced-sodium soy sauce.

Some babies are sensitive to certain foods, but how do you know which foods? Certain reactions, perhaps a rash, diarrhea or vomiting, are tell-tale signs that a food doesn't agree with your baby. Academy Spokesperson Marina Chaparro, RDN, CDE, MPH explains, ""Food sensitivities and food allergies are not the same. Understanding the difference between them is important, especially in children, because it could have important nutrition implications in growing kids. A food allergy is a reaction by the immune system by a food that sees it as a threat. Food sensitivities on the other hand can be harder to pinpoint because they have a delayed response in the body. Unfortunately, there are no clear tests to identify a food sensitivity"".    The good news is that most babies outgrow these reactions once their immune and digestive systems mature. In the meantime, monitor your baby for food reactions.     Keep track of everything your baby eats. ""Parents should keep a detailed log of symptoms encountered such as rashes, tummy aches, headaches and bowel movements,"" says Chaparro. Until you know which foods upset your baby, serve single-grain infant cereals and plain fruits, vegetables and meats instead of mixed varieties. If your baby has a reaction to a certain food, stop that food.   As you introduce new foods, offer one at a time. Wait a couple of days before introducing another new food. That way if your baby has a problem, you'll know which food caused it.   If any food causes a significant and ongoing problem, talk to your baby's doctor. Together, you can establish a plan that is best for your baby. ""First consult your pediatrician or allergist and seek the help of a registered dietitian nutritionist. An RDN can give you advice on what foods are safe to include as well as meal plans so your child's diet is always adequate"".

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Weaning is the slow, gradual process that helps your baby eat and enjoy your family's foods. The time for weaning is an individual matter for mother and baby. Experts encourage moms to breast-feed for at least 12 months. Babies benefit from breast-feeding for as long as it's mutually right for mother and baby.    No matter how long you choose to nurse, start complementary foods, too, when your baby's ready. If your baby is exclusively breast-fed, that's about at 6 months of age. Talk to your pediatrician about timing. When your baby eats other foods, too, you'll probably nurse less often: typically first thing in the morning, naptimes and bedtime.   When you choose to wean your baby, introduce either infant formula or cow's milk, depending on your baby's age. If your baby is under 12 months of age, wean from breast milk to iron-fortified infant formula. If your baby is twelve months or older, whole cow milk is appropriate.   Should you wean your baby to a bottle or a cup? That depends on his or her developmental readiness. Between 4 and 6 months, most infants will drink or suck small amounts of liquid from a cup or a glass when someone else holds it. Older babies and toddlers usually have the coordination to drink fluids from a cup or a straw. However, for infants under 6 months of age, a bottle is probably the best choice.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    In spite of the added work, some parents get satisfaction from preparing baby food themselves. However, that requires extra care to keep baby's food safe and to retain the nutrients from fresh foods.   Commercial baby foods are nutritious options for feeding baby, too. Today's commercial baby foods provide balance and variety with carefully controlled and consistent nutrient content.   Follow these guidelines if you choose to prepare homemade baby food:     Wash your hands before preparing baby food.   Always use clean cutting boards, utensils and containers to cook, puree and store homemade baby food.   Wash, peel and remove seeds or pits from produce. Take special care with fruits and vegetables that are grown close to the ground; they may contain spores for  Clostridium botulinum  or contain other harmful bacteria that can cause food poisoning.    Start with fresh or frozen vegetables. Cook them until tender by steaming or microwaving, then puree or mash. There's no need to add salt, other seasonings or sweeteners. Remember: A baby's tastes aren't the same as yours.   Puree or mash fresh fruit or fruit canned in its own juice. Never add honey or corn syrup.   Avoid putting egg whites in homemade baby food until the baby's first birthday. Egg whites, more likely than egg yolks, may cause an allergic reaction. Cook any egg whites you feed your toddler.   Cook meats, poultry and egg yolks until well done. Babies are especially susceptible to food poisoning caused by eating undercooked meats, poultry and eggs. Again, there's no need for added flavorings.   Prepare foods with a texture appropriate for the baby's feeding state. Puree foods in a food processor, blender or baby food grinder, or mash them with a fork; or chop them well, so your baby won't choke.   Cover and refrigerate or freeze homemade baby food immediately after it's prepared. Keep homemade baby food in a covered container for one or two days in the refrigerator or three to four months in the freezer. Label and date homemade baby food.   For convenience, freeze prepared baby food for later use. Freeze it in small portions in a clean ice cube tray. Once frozen, put the cubes into clean, airtight, plastic bags for single-serve portions. As another method, use the ""plop and freeze"" technique: plop meal-size spoonfuls of pureed food onto a cookie sheet, freeze, then transfer the frozen baby food to clean plastic bags for continued freezing.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.            Introducing your baby to solid foods is an exciting milestone your little one is sure to enjoy. When you start introducing children to the world of solid foods, you are helping them shape food and feeding habits while establishing healthy eating patterns.   Not sure how to get your baby started on solid foods? These tips will help.     Is My Baby Ready for Solid Foods?   DO  check with your pediatrician before starting solid foods. Most people in the medical community agree the best time to start your baby on solid foods is at 4 to 6 months old. Look for physical signs that your baby is ready for solids, such as sitting up with limited support, good head and neck control and keeping most of the food in the mouth and swallowing it.   DON'T  get caught up in comparing your baby's progress or readiness to start solids to another baby. Not all babies reach milestones at the same time. Never force your baby to eat if crying or turning away when you offer solids. Your baby might not be ready to try eating from a spoon, or she might just not be hungry! Go back to nursing or bottle-feeding exclusively for a day or two before trying again.    What Should I Feed My Baby?   DO  start with a single-grain infant cereal mixed with breast milk or formula, or a pureed fruit or vegetable. Some easily tolerated first foods are iron-fortified infant rice or oatmeal cereal, pureed avocado, banana, sweet potato, carrots, pears or peas. Mix breast milk or formula with your desired pureed food until it has a thin, liquid consistency. Gradually increase the thickness of the puree when your baby can swallow without trouble. Wait three to four days before introducing another food to your baby. If you suspect a reaction, stop feeding your baby the new food immediately and contact your pediatrician.    DON'T  stop breast-feeding or formula-feeding just because you're working on the switch to solids. Breast milk or formula is still your baby's main source of nutrition and calories. And, even if it might seem like an easy out, never add honey, salt or sugar to baby food to ""entice"" or ""trick"" your baby into liking it.    How Do I Feed My Baby?   DO  try to relax. Most of the first few solid-food feedings will wind up on your baby's face, hands and bib. While there is no exact serving size of solid foods for babies, the general rule of thumb is to start small, giving your baby about one to two teaspoons of pureed food. Gradually increase this amount over time.    DON'T  feed your baby solid foods from a bottle. Always spoon-feed from a bowl, not from the jar of food unless your baby will finish it. Feeding directly from the jar may introduce bacteria from your baby's mouth to the spoon and back into the food, creating a food safety issue. If your baby is still hungry, use a clean spoon to take more food from the jar. Sometimes children will turn away from the spoon or clamp their mouth closed. If this happens, stop feeding your baby. It's important to never force-feed a baby.   Whatever happens, don't get discouraged and do enjoy the ride. With a little patience and creativity, you can make your baby's first solid food eating experience fun for everyone involved!

Teaching your baby to use a spoon is a big transition in infant feeding. Have you ever wondered if it is okay to skip the spoon and put solid foods, such as infant cereal, in your baby's bottle?   Giving your baby solid foods from a bottle isn't wise. Possible problems with this technique are:     It can cause a delay in learning feeding skills.    Cereal of other foods from a bottle can be a choking hazard.   It may encourage your baby to eat too much.     Spoon-feeding, with rests between each bite, gives your baby time to feel full and learn to self-regulate. And despite a popular misconception, putting cereal in your baby's bottle won't help him sleep through the night.             Tags     Food   Nutrition   Healthy Eating   For Kids   For Baby"

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    If you choose not to breast-feed or to stop breast-feeding before one year, meet your baby's nutritional needs with iron-fortified formula. With breast or bottle, babies do best when feeding times are filled with cuddling and love. Sit in a quiet, comfortable place and relax. Hold your baby in a semi-upright position and talk softly while feeding.   Every baby has a different feeding rhythm and it takes some babies a while to settle into a regular routine. Offer your baby a bottle every two to three hours or when he or she seems hungry. Allow your baby to decide when to stop eating. Toward the end of a feeding, your baby may fall into a light sleep or naturally turn away from the bottle. Never try to force a baby to finish a bottle.   Gently burp your baby midway and at the end of feeding. Burping removes uncomfortable air from your baby's tummy; you can burp your baby over your shoulder or knee. Spitting up small amounts of formula is normal during feeding or burping.   Choosing the Right Formula   There are different types and forms of infant formula; your baby's doctor or clinic can help you choose the right one. The most common formulas are made from specially treated cow's milk and fortified with iron. Regular cow's milk should never be given to children younger than 1 year. Babies cannot digest milk protein properly and it doesn't contain the right amounts of iron or vitamin C for growing infants.   Your health-care provider may recommend a soy formula or other specialized formulas such as those for premature babies. Discuss any feeding changes with your doctor or a registered dietitian nutritionist. Formulas come in ready-to-use, concentrate and powder forms. Powder is the least expensive. Read the label and follow all mixing instructions carefully.   Baby Bottle Safety   Keep babies safe while bottle feeding. Here are the best ways to keep your baby from getting sick, reduce the risk of injuries and promote good dental health:     Keep Formula Clean  Wash your hands before mixing formula or feeding. Clean bottles in the dishwasher or follow the manufacturer's instructions. Use refrigerated formula within 48 hours of mixing and discard anything left in the bottle after a feeding.   Warm Formula Carefully   Never heat bottles in the microwave or on top of the stove. Warm bottles under running water or in a pan of hot water. Test the temperature of the formula by shaking a few drops onto your inner arm and use immediately.   Use Only Formula in Bottles   Never put anything in a baby's bottle except formula or pumped breast milk: no honey, no cereal, no other food and no sweetened drinks like soda or powered drinks. By the time your child is ready to drink juice at about nine months, or cow's milk after one year, he or she is also ready to use a cup.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    If your little one is big enough for the high chair and  solid foods , you have numerous nutritious options at the supermarket to feed your baby. And, if you prepare homemade baby food, you have even more variety: Not only can you pick from all the fruits and vegetables in the produce section, but also frozen veggies and fruit canned in its own juice. Making your own food can expose babies to more flavors, which can help them become more adventurous eaters, says Bridget Swinney, MS, RDN, LD. Furthermore, by avoiding added sugars and salt, you're in greater control of your baby's nutrition.   Getting Started   If you are interested in preparing your own baby food, but find the idea daunting, start with just a few homemade items to supplement store-bought baby food. Mashing a very ripe avocado or banana is a good place to begin and exceptionally simple, says Swinney. After that, she recommends preparing nutrient-rich foods that aren't common in the baby food aisle, such as beets, broccoli, turnips, asparagus, spinach, blueberries, kale, mango and papaya.    ""Use whatever is in season and tastes amazing,"" adds Sarah Krieger, MPH, RDN, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, who says preparing baby food for each of her three children was a win-win decision. Everyone in the family ate the same nutritious foods, which saved her time and effort, she explains. Good choices for protein-rich foods include cooked eggs, salmon, lentils, chicken and lean beef. However, a word of caution, wait until your baby is at least 6 months old before serving home-prepared spinach, beets, turnips, carrots or collard greens due to the nitrate content that may make younger babies sick.    Preparing Food   Be vigilant about sanitation. Use only well-scrubbed and washed produce, and clean hands, utensils and countertops, says Swinney.      Cook food until it's very tender. Steaming and microwaving in just a little water are good methods to retain vitamins and minerals in fruits and vegetables. When cooking meats and fish, remove all fat, gristle, skin and bones before cooking. Be certain that all meats and fish are cooked to proper temperatures.   If you're cooking the same food for the rest of the family, remove the baby's portion before adding salt and seasonings. As the baby grows and becomes more used to table food, feel free to add seasonings other than salt.   Puree or mash the food with a little water, if necessary. It's easiest to puree cooked meats in small pieces and while still warm. A food processor, immersion blender or stand blender all do the trick.     Keeping Baby Safe   After you've prepared the food, either serve it or refrigerate it right away. To avoid illness, throw out leftovers that are more than two days old. If you prepare a large batch of food, freeze it in a clean ice cube tray so you have infant-sized portions when you need them. Homemade baby food keeps for three to four months in the freezer. Small portions are ideal because any food that was served, but not eaten, must be thrown out. Bacteria thrive in the mouth, explains Krieger, so if a spoon goes into the baby's mouth and then touches the food, that food cannot be saved.

Which infant-feeding practices do you follow (or have you followed) when feeding your baby  or perhaps when helping a new parent?For each item below, answer yes or no:       Count the number of wet diapers (six or more every 24 hours) to make sure your breast- or formula-fed baby is getting enough to eat.   Offer breast milk or formula, not cow milk, to your baby up to12 months of age.   If your baby is bottle-fed, choose an iron-fortified formula  unless your baby's doctor advises otherwise.   Discard unused expressed breast milk or infant formula after a bottle feeding.   Wait to start solid foods, as directed by your doctor  perhaps until6 months if your baby is exclusively breast-fed.   Always wash your hands before feeding your baby.   Clean all baby-feeding equipment with hot, soapy water, and rinse well.   Avoid putting your baby to bed with a bottle.   Offer infant cereal that's iron fortified.   Start with single foods  one new food at a time.   Monitor your baby's reaction to a new food, in case of a reaction.   Offer your baby enough to eat, rather than trying to restrict calories or fat.   Check the temperature of food or bottles that are heated so they're evenly warmed, not hot!   Try new foods several times, rather than giving up after one or two tries.   Let your baby  not you set the feeding pace.   Remain patient as your baby learns to feed himself or herself.   Offer smooth foods until your baby is ready for mashed or finely chopped foods.   Always stay with your baby while he or she is eating.   Discard unused food after a feeding.   Make infant feeding a special time to nurture and enjoy your baby  these days don't last!     Now Score Yourself:  Give yourself  and your baby a big hug if you said ""yes"" to all20 items. If you said ""no"" to any item, keep checking the Kids Eat Right website for more information. Then practice what you learn. Your baby's health depends on it!

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Baby bottles.  Plastic or glass bottles, or disposable bottle bags? The choice is yours. Some parents keep a variety of baby-bottle sizes and styles on hand for different purposes. For example, disposable bottle bags are handy when you're on the go and when washing facilities are limited. For convenience, bottles with disposable liners let you toss away the used liner when the feeding is done. Small-size bottles are perfect for holding 2- or 3-ounce feedings during the first weeks after delivery. Be cautious of bottles with cute shapes; they're often hard to clean.   Try to use plastic baby bottles that are free of bisphenol A (BPA). You can take reasonable steps to reduce exposure to them. Switch to glass baby bottles or to plastic baby bottles and sippy cups labeled BPA-free.   Baby-bottle nipples.  They come in many shapes and sizes. Choose nipples that match your baby's mouth size and developmental needs. A baby's comfort and ease of sucking are the criteria to use when choosing a nipple.   There are four basic baby-bottle nipple types: regular nipple with slow, medium or fast flow (the number and size of the holes will determine flow); nipple for very small or premature babies; orthodontic nipple, which imitates the shape of a human nipple during breastfeeding; and cleft-palate nipple. A cleft-palate nipple is meant for babies with a lip or palate problem that keeps them from sucking properly.   Keep bottle-feeding equipment in good condition:     Discard cracked or chipped bottles that could break and spill formula onto your baby. Toss scratched plastic bottles.   Replace nipples regularly, as they can become 'gummy' or cracked with age. Check them by pulling the tip before each use.   Check the size of the opening on new nipples and then periodically as you use them. Formula should flow from the nipple in even drops  not a steady stream. If the milk flows too quickly, your baby could choke, so discard the nipple. If the milk flows too slowly for your baby, consider trying a nipple with more holes, designed for older babies.     When it comes to preparing infant formula and washing bottles, cleanliness is essential! Your baby's immune system isn't fully developed, so he or she is very susceptible to food poisoning from improperly cleaned feeding equipment.     Use hot, soapy water to wash your hands, work area, measuring utensils, bottles and nipples. If possible, wash bottles right away when they're easier to clean.   Thoroughly clean reusable bottles, caps and nipples by washing them with hot, soapy water and rinsing them well before each use. Sanitize nipples and bottles in boiling water for two minutes, and then let them air-dry. Or wash bottles, rings and caps in the top dishwasher rack. Look for dishwasher baskets designed to hold bottle parts and to keep them from falling to the dishwasher bottom.   Remember: The outer ""shell"" of bottles with disposable bottle bags needs regular washing to destroy bacteria.   Opening a new can of formula? First, wash the can opener and the can's lid with soap and water; rinse well.

Good dental care begins at birth even before baby teeth appear! Healthy teeth let children chew food easier, learn to talk clearly, and smile with self-assurance.       Make cleaning your baby's teeth and gums part of the daily bathtub routine. Starting at birth, clean your baby's gums with a soft infant toothbrush and water, or use a clean, wet washcloth or gauze pad. Do this after every feeding. Skip toothpaste, which babies often swallow.   Schedule your baby's first visit to a pediatric dentist after the first tooth appears (at about six to 12 months).   Fluoride is a mineral that helps teeth develop and resist decay. In many places, fluoride is naturally present in local water supplies at various levels. If you live in an area that doesn't have fluoridated water, ask your baby's doctor if your baby or child needs a fluoride supplement. Unless your child's dentist advises otherwise, wait until after age two or three years to start with fluoridated toothpaste.    To avoid tooth decay, do not put your infant, toddler, or young child to bed with a bottle of juice, formula, or milk. The liquid that bathes the teeth and gums from sucking on the bottle stays on teeth and can cause tooth decay. That happens even if a baby's teeth haven't yet erupted through the gums. If your child won't nap or go to bed without a bottle, fill it with plain water instead.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Reflux, or gastroesophageal reflux (GER), is a common condition affecting 40 to 65 percent of infants. It peaks between 1 and 4 months and usually resolves by 12 months of age. Babies that have GER regurgitate, or spit up, shortly after eating. This happens when stomach contents return up the esophagus and into and out of the mouth.   Cause of GER in Infants   The cause of GER is an immature digestive system. The muscle that separates the stomach from the esophagus can be underdeveloped in some babies, allowing undigested stomach content to rise up into the esophagus. This muscle matures between 6 and 12 months of age, so most babies grow out of GER by their first birthday with only 1 percent of toddlers having GER.   In most cases, reflux is mild and normal. If you have a happy baby who is eating and growing normally, theres no reason to be concerned. Severe GER, however, can indicate gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) or gastrointestinal obstruction, which are rare but more serious conditions. Speak with your pediatrician if your baby is not gaining weight, spits up large amounts, vomits forcefully (projectile vomiting), spits up green or yellow fluid, repeatedly refuses food, or has difficulty breathing after vomiting.   Preventing GER   Here are some tips to prevent reflux in your baby:     Feed small, frequent meals.   Get rid of excess gas by burping your baby more frequently not only after, but during feeding.   Keep your baby upright at least 30 minutes after feeding.   Continue to breast-feed. Research doesnt show that a mother's diet causes reflux in the breast-fed baby, even though this is a common belief held by some, says Melinda Johnson, MS, RD, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.   If you use infant formula, switch to a thickened formula with the help of your pediatrician.     An estimated 5 percent of infants are unable to handle proteins found in milk or soy formulas. Consult with your pediatrician about alternative formulas. Keep a journal of all foods eaten and symptoms experienced, and add only one new food at a time to pinpoint trigger foods, says registered dietitian nutritionist Rachel Begun, MS, RDN.   A  registered dietitian nutritionist  can help you analyze a food journal and instruct you on creating the best eating plan for your baby.   Long-Term Prognosis for Infants with GER   Johnson assures parents that most babies grow out of reflux as their gastrointestinal track matures. Check with the babys doctor to monitor weight and ensure your baby is staying hydrated and not experiencing an obstruction of the gastrointestinal tract, she says.   However, if symptoms continue beyond the first year of age, especially if your toddler is showing signs of poor growth or problems with breathing, consult your pediatrician. Babies who frequently spit up may be more likely to develop GERD as older children.         Reviewed January 2014       Tags     Health   Wellness   Digestive Health   For Kids   For Baby"

It's no secret breast-feeding is best for baby and best for mom. In fact, the U.S. Surgeon General recommends babies be fed exclusively with breast milk for the first six months. Breast milk's unique antibodies help protect infants from numerous illnesses and diseases. Breast-feeding also helps reduce a nursing mother's risk of diabetes, breast and ovarian cancers and post-partum depression.   Breast-feeding has both environmental and economic benefits, since it eliminates the costs and wastes associated with formula production and plastic bottles. Depending on the formula brand, breast-feeding can save your family $1,000 to $4,000 per year.   While breast-feeding is the most natural way to feed a baby, new moms need information and support to be successful. Here are some steps for breast-feeding success.   Before Your Baby Arrives   The third trimester of pregnancy is a great time to learn about breast-feeding, so you can be informed and confident when the baby comes.     Take a breast-feeding class.  Check availability at your hospital, doctor's office or WIC clinic. Learn about community resources such as lactation consultants so you'll know whom to call with questions or concerns.   Read about it.  Check out books and pamphlets from the clinic, hospital or library. The more you know, the more relaxed you'll be in your new role as a breast-feeding mom.   Tell everyone about your plans to breast-feed.  Let your family, friends, doctor, hospital nurses, pediatrician and employer know you plan to give only breast milk to your baby and you'll need their support.     At the Hospital   Healthy newborns know how to find the breast and how to suckle. They just need plenty of snuggle time with mom to practice and build up a good milk supply.     Room-in and feed frequently.  Having your baby with you allows you to respond to his or her hunger cues immediately. The more milk your baby removes from the breasts, the more milk you will make. Formula feeding will disrupt this natural process.   Ask for help.  Most hospitals have a lactation specialist who can help you find solutions if you're experiencing difficulties with early breast-feeding.     During the First Year and Beyond   Your breasts will easily make enough milk in response to your baby's growing needs. Most infants will need several feedings through the day and night, especially during the first weeks and growth spurts. Allow your baby to develop his or her own feeding schedule.     Take care of yourself.  Breast-feeding moms need plenty of nutrient-rich foods and fluids to maintain their stamina while producing milk. Make sure to get enough rest. Many moms take a nap while their babies sleep.   Turn to resources for support.  If you need help figuring how to breast-feed while working or going to school, or if you have an infant with special needs, check with your pediatrician, lactation specialist or a registered dietitian nutritionist.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Baby, baby, baby...   Is it possible to effectively breast-feed twins or triplets? Yes! And, it's worth the effort. Breast milk delivers the nutrients and antibodies babies need in an easy-to-digest, convenient and economical package. Breast-fed babies tend to have lower risks of respiratory tract, gastrointestinal and ear infections, as well as eczema, diabetes, obesity and Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) among other conditions. Breast-feeding also provides advantages for new moms, including valuable bonding time with the baby and a weight-loss boost.    The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend exclusive breast-feeding for the first 6 months of life. Ideally, complementary breast-feeding is continued once solid foods are introduced through at least 12 months.    Nursing multiples is nutritionally demanding. Healthy breast-feeding moms need to consume about 500 extra calories per baby per day. And, don't forget to increase fluid consumption too. Nursing mothers should focus on achieving this higher-calorie goal through a well-balanced diet of fruits, vegetables, lean protein, fat-free or low-fat dairy and whole grains to get adequate overall nutrition, including sources of iron and calcium.   For optimal brain development, breast-feeding mothers should get adequate omega-3 fatty acids, particularly docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). This can come from eating two weekly servings of fatty fish such as salmon or sardines, or supplementation.   How does breast-feeding work when there are two or three bundles of joy? Though it seems daunting, it is possible. Melinda Johnson, MS, RDN, LD, says, ""With multiples, you face similar challenges whether you bottle or breast-feed.""   Johnson and Alicia Simpson, MS, RD, LD, a lactation consultant, offer some tips for breast-feeding moms of multiples:     Get a good lactation consultant. A lactation consultant can help instill confidence and answer concerns along the way.   Get the first and second babies on the same schedule. ""The most successful moms usually nurse two babies at once and then pump and feed the other child(ren) expressed breast milk in a bottle,"" says Simpson.    Take help from a partner. Simpson praises the partner who can take over the role of changing diapers, soothing and playing with the babies to allow the mother time to rest and concentrate on nourishing her children.     Notes on Nursing Premature Multiples   It's not uncommon for multiples to arrive a little early. Premature babies may have digestion difficulties eased by breast milk which is easier on tiny tummies. Importantly, premature babies often lack the muscle development to latch on and suck properly. If this happens, pump to keep mom's milk flowing until the babies are able to breast-feed directly.   Johnson notes that premature babies may not be ready for solid foods as soon as full-term babies. ""They take a little longer to develop the chewing motion,"" she says. Johnson encourages parents and healthcare providers to work together to identify feeding cues that will move the child forward. In the toddler stage, children born prematurely may experience developmental delays that may make mealtime a challenge. Practice patience and repetition.   Whether you're feeding one, two, three or more babies, never underestimate the power of nutrition, a good lactation consultant, partner support and patience to give them the best start at life.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    From first words to first steps, there are many firsts to come for your baby  but food poisoning shouldn't be one of them. Since young children and infants are at an increased risk for food poisoning, learning the basics of baby bottle safety is important to keeping your infant protected.   Baby Bottle Cleaning   Both breast milk and prepared formula are susceptible to bacterial contamination if not handled properly, which is why sterilizing and cleaning can go a long way.   Before the very first use, sterilizing baby bottles in boiling water for five minutes is recommended, though it's not necessary to do this regularly.   For daily cleaning of bottles and supplies, however, you'll only need soap, hot water and a baby bottle brush.     Fill sink with hot water and add dishwashing liquid.   Add bottles, nipples, caps, rings, preparation utensils and other supplies.   Pour hot, soapy water into bottles, and rotate a baby bottle brush inside until the bottle is clean. Wash away all soapy water under running water.   Use a nipple brush to wash nipples and nipple holes. Squeeze the hot, soapy water through the nipple hole to flush out any trapped milk.   Thoroughly rinse all utensils under running water to wash away all traces of soapy water.   Use sanitized tongs to remove bottles, nipples and other utensils and place them in the dish drainer to dry.     Even if you use disposable plastic bottle liners and ready-to-use formula, you still need to make sure the bottles and nipples are clean. Additionally, washing and drying in a dishwasher is safe, but only with heated water and a hot drying cycle. First check the manufacturer label to make sure items are dishwasher safe.   And, don't forget, before handling baby bottles (or feeding your baby), always wash your hands thoroughly with hot, soapy water for at least 20 seconds.

Until solid foods are introduced preferably at about six months breast milk can be a complete source of nutrition for infants. However, three nutrients may warrant additional consideration. Ask your doctor for advice.    Iron.  Iron is important for the manufacture of hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout the body. Iron also is essential for your baby's brain development and growth.   Premature infants who breast-feed may need iron supplementation earlier. They had less time to build adequate iron reserves before birth.   Fluoride.  Your baby's teeth started to develop even before you could see them. Fluoride, a mineral often found in tap water, helps develop strong teeth and prevent cavities later.   Breast milk contains little fluoride even if the mother's drinking water is fluoridated. If your breast-fed infant takes supplemental formula made with fluoridated water at least 0.3 ppm (parts per million) of fluoride your baby may get enough fluoride. If your child is breast-fed only or drinks formula made with well water, distilled water, unfluoridated bottled water or city unfluoridated water, your doctor may advise a fluoride supplement starting at about six months. Breast-fed infants who take supplemental ready-to-use formula also may need a fluoride supplement; these formulas usually are prepared with water low in fluoride.   Vitamin D.  This vitamin helps your baby use calcium from breast milk (and infant formula) to help bones grow and develop. When it is exposed to sunlight, the body can make vitamin D but a baby's skin should be protected from sunlight with sunscreen or clothing.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Believe it or not, your baby starts tasting foods long before she or he gets the first spoonful of cereal. In fact, researchers at the  Monell Center  in Philadelphia discovered that a baby's sensory system can taste flavors from its mother's diet that travel through the mother's bloodstream into the amniotic fluid.    Breast Milk Introduces New Flavors   Your newborn tastes more new flavors during breast-feeding. Spices, herbs, and natural flavors from foods like onions and garlic can give breast milk a distinct taste. This introduces your baby to the taste of foods in your diet. ""Breastfeeding moms should continue to eat a variety of foods, including strongly flavored, nutrition-packed vegetables like broccoli that supply important vitamins and minerals,"" advises Sarah Krieger, MPH, RD, LD/N, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""Moms of fussy babies can be quick to eliminate certain foods in their diet but fussiness often is caused by other factors.""   Breast-fed babies generally adapt well to the taste of solid foods. ""When it comes time to start solids, they accept new foods more readily than formula fed babies do because of the flavors in breast milk,"" says Karen Peters, MBA, RD, IBCLC, executive director of the Breastfeeding Task Force of Greater Los Angeles.    Try Foods More Than Once   Babies are naturally afraid of new things so you may have to serve the same food several times before your child takes a taste. ""If your child refuses a food like mashed sweet potato or mashed avocado, simply take it away and try the same food again a few days later,"" suggests Krieger. ""Try to keep meals happy and peaceful for your child by staying calm, avoiding begging your child to eat, and letting him or her set the pace for eating.""   Once your child has progressed to table foods, serve dishes with seasonings that are part of your family food culture such as cinnamon, curry powder, chili powder, cilantro, or garlic. Avoid highly spicy seasonings that could irritate the mouth or tongue such as cayenne pepper or Tabasco sauce until your child is a bit older. Also, keep salt to a minimum so that your child gets used to the natural flavors of unsalted or lightly salted foods.

Some babies are sensitive to certain foods, but how do you know which foods? Certain reactions, perhaps a rash, diarrhea or vomiting, are tell-tale signs that a food doesn't agree with your baby. Academy Spokesperson Marina Chaparro, RDN, CDE, MPH explains, ""Food sensitivities and food allergies are not the same. Understanding the difference between them is important, especially in children, because it could have important nutrition implications in growing kids. A food allergy is a reaction by the immune system by a food that sees it as a threat. Food sensitivities on the other hand can be harder to pinpoint because they have a delayed response in the body. Unfortunately, there are no clear tests to identify a food sensitivity"".    The good news is that most babies outgrow these reactions once their immune and digestive systems mature. In the meantime, monitor your baby for food reactions.     Keep track of everything your baby eats. ""Parents should keep a detailed log of symptoms encountered such as rashes, tummy aches, headaches and bowel movements,"" says Chaparro. Until you know which foods upset your baby, serve single-grain infant cereals and plain fruits, vegetables and meats instead of mixed varieties. If your baby has a reaction to a certain food, stop that food.   As you introduce new foods, offer one at a time. Wait a couple of days before introducing another new food. That way if your baby has a problem, you'll know which food caused it.   If any food causes a significant and ongoing problem, talk to your baby's doctor. Together, you can establish a plan that is best for your baby. ""First consult your pediatrician or allergist and seek the help of a registered dietitian nutritionist.

When Should I Wean My Baby?

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Weaning is the slow, gradual process that helps your baby eat and enjoy your family's foods. The time for weaning is an individual matter for mother and baby. Experts encourage moms to breast-feed for at least 12 months. Babies benefit from breast-feeding for as long as it's mutually right for mother and baby.    No matter how long you choose to nurse, start complementary foods, too, when your baby's ready. If your baby is exclusively breast-fed, that's about at 6 months of age. Talk to your pediatrician about timing. When your baby eats other foods, too, you'll probably nurse less often: typically first thing in the morning, naptimes and bedtime.   When you choose to wean your baby, introduce either infant formula or cow's milk, depending on your baby's age. If your baby is under 12 months of age, wean from breast milk to iron-fortified infant formula. If your baby is twelve months or older, whole cow milk is appropriate.   Should you wean your baby to a bottle or a cup? That depends on his or her developmental readiness. Between 4 and 6 months, most infants will drink or suck small amounts of liquid from a cup or a glass when someone else holds it. Older babies and toddlers usually have the coordination to drink fluids from a cup or a straw. However, for infants under 6 months of age, a bottle is probably the best choice.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    In spite of the added work, some parents get satisfaction from preparing baby food themselves. However, that requires extra care to keep baby's food safe and to retain the nutrients from fresh foods.   Commercial baby foods are nutritious options for feeding baby, too. Today's commercial baby foods provide balance and variety with carefully controlled and consistent nutrient content.   Follow these guidelines if you choose to prepare homemade baby food:     Wash your hands before preparing baby food.   Always use clean cutting boards, utensils and containers to cook, puree and store homemade baby food.   Wash, peel and remove seeds or pits from produce. Take special care with fruits and vegetables that are grown close to the ground; they may contain spores for  Clostridium botulinum  or contain other harmful bacteria that can cause food poisoning.    Start with fresh or frozen vegetables. Cook them until tender by steaming or microwaving, then puree or mash. There's no need to add salt, other seasonings or sweeteners. Remember: A baby's tastes aren't the same as yours.   Puree or mash fresh fruit or fruit canned in its own juice. Never add honey or corn syrup.   Avoid putting egg whites in homemade baby food until the baby's first birthday. Egg whites, more likely than egg yolks, may cause an allergic reaction. Cook any egg whites you feed your toddler.   Cook meats, poultry and egg yolks until well done. Babies are especially susceptible to food poisoning caused by eating undercooked meats, poultry and eggs. Again, there's no need for added flavorings.   Prepare foods with a texture appropriate for the baby's feeding state. Puree foods in a food processor, blender or baby food grinder, or mash them with a fork; or chop them well, so your baby won't choke.   Cover and refrigerate or freeze homemade baby food immediately after it's prepared. Keep homemade baby food in a covered container for one or two days in the refrigerator or three to four months in the freezer. Label and date homemade baby food.   For convenience, freeze prepared baby food for later use. Freeze it in small portions in a clean ice cube tray. Once frozen, put the cubes into clean, airtight, plastic bags for single-serve portions. As another method, use the ""plop and freeze"" technique: plop meal-size spoonfuls of pureed food onto a cookie sheet, freeze, then transfer the frozen baby food to clean plastic bags for continued freezing.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.            Introducing your baby to solid foods is an exciting milestone your little one is sure to enjoy. When you start introducing children to the world of solid foods, you are helping them shape food and feeding habits while establishing healthy eating patterns.   Not sure how to get your baby started on solid foods? These tips will help.     Is My Baby Ready for Solid Foods?   DO  check with your pediatrician before starting solid foods. Most people in the medical community agree the best time to start your baby on solid foods is at 4 to 6 months old. Look for physical signs that your baby is ready for solids, such as sitting up with limited support, good head and neck control and keeping most of the food in the mouth and swallowing it.   DON'T  get caught up in comparing your baby's progress or readiness to start solids to another baby. Not all babies reach milestones at the same time. Never force your baby to eat if crying or turning away when you offer solids. Your baby might not be ready to try eating from a spoon, or she might just not be hungry! Go back to nursing or bottle-feeding exclusively for a day or two before trying again.    What Should I Feed My Baby?   DO  start with a single-grain infant cereal mixed with breast milk or formula, or a pureed fruit or vegetable. Some easily tolerated first foods are iron-fortified infant rice or oatmeal cereal, pureed avocado, banana, sweet potato, carrots, pears or peas. Mix breast milk or formula with your desired pureed food until it has a thin, liquid consistency. Gradually increase the thickness of the puree when your baby can swallow without trouble. Wait three to four days before introducing another food to your baby. If you suspect a reaction, stop feeding your baby the new food immediately and contact your pediatrician.    DON'T  stop breast-feeding or formula-feeding just because you're working on the switch to solids. Breast milk or formula is still your baby's main source of nutrition and calories. And, even if it might seem like an easy out, never add honey, salt or sugar to baby food to ""entice"" or ""trick"" your baby into liking it.    How Do I Feed My Baby?   DO  try to relax. Most of the first few solid-food feedings will wind up on your baby's face, hands and bib. While there is no exact serving size of solid foods for babies, the general rule of thumb is to start small, giving your baby about one to two teaspoons of pureed food. Gradually increase this amount over time.    DON'T  feed your baby solid foods from a bottle. Always spoon-feed from a bowl, not from the jar of food unless your baby will finish it. Feeding directly from the jar may introduce bacteria from your baby's mouth to the spoon and back into the food, creating a food safety issue. If your baby is still hungry, use a clean spoon to take more food from the jar. Sometimes children will turn away from the spoon or clamp their mouth closed. If this happens, stop feeding your baby. It's important to never force-feed a baby.   Whatever happens, don't get discouraged and do enjoy the ride. With a little patience and creativity, you can make your baby's first solid food eating experience fun for everyone involved!

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    The choices parents make in feeding their infants can have a lifetime impact on your child's health and weight. Research shows breast-feeding can reduce the risk of ear infections, stomach viruses and childhood leukemia. It also increases children's chance of having a healthy weight later in life.   The first year is when humans grow fastest. Most babies double their birth weight by 5 to 6 months old and triple it by one year. Health care providers check height and weight at each visit to make sure infants are gaining enough, but not too much, weight. Some studies suggest early overfeeding and excessive weight gain during infancy may increase the risk of childhood weight problems later on.   Supporting Normal Eating and Healthy Growth   Take a balanced approach to weight gain during your baby's first years. Parents should not put babies or children on diets or restrict their intake of nutrient-rich foods.   Your goal is to help infants regulate their own food intake based on internal cues of hunger and fullness. This helps them eat what they need for healthy growth and development. Discuss your baby's weight gain pattern with your health care provider at every checkup so you know how your child is growing.   Food Timeline for the First Two Years   All babies are unique individuals. Talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian nutritionist about the nutrient-rich foods your baby needs and when to introduce them. Here are the usual age ranges for moving infants from breast milk to table foods.     Birth to 6 Months: Babies get all the nutrients they need from breast milk for the first six months. Infant formula is an acceptable alternative when mothers decide to decrease or discontinue breast-feeding. You should not give your baby cow's milk until after age 1.   By 4 to 6 Months: While most babies are ready to eat solid foods now, they will continue to get most of their calories, protein, vitamins and minerals from breast milk or infant formula. Introduce iron-fortified infant cereal or pureed meats to help replenish iron reserves.   By 6 to 8 Months: This is an appropriate time to begin pureed or mashed fruits and vegetables. Gradually introduce single-item foods one at a time. Watch carefully for any reactions such as diarrhea, vomiting or unusual rashes.   By 7 to 10 Months: Babies are usually ready to begin feeding themselves with finger foods, such as dry cereal or teething biscuits. They also can begin to use a cup for water.   By 8 to 12 Months: At this stage, most infants are ready for soft or cooked table foods.   From 1 to 2 Years: Babies continue developing eating skills. They feed themselves and enjoy the same foods as the rest of the family. Choking on firm, round foods is a risk, so cut these foods into smaller, -inch squares.   Look out for other choking hazards, including nuts and seeds, popcorn, pretzels, raw carrots and celery, whole olives and cherry tomatoes, hot dogs, whole grapes, large pieces of meat, hard candy and cough drops, chewing gum, gummy candy, marshmallows and cherries with pits.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    During the first two years, children move from exclusive breast or bottle feeding to eating table foods with the rest of the family. There are two important parts of this process:     What specific foods and textures to introduce at each age   How best to feed babies so they develop a healthy relationship with food.     Types of Foods   The order in which you introduce solid foods doesn't matter for most babies. The traditional progression has been single-grain cereals followed by vegetables, fruits and meats. While there is nothing wrong with this pattern, pureed meat or poultry actually may be the best first food to provide sources of iron and zinc.   Introduce one new food at a time and wait three to five days before starting another. If you notice diarrhea, vomiting or rashes, stop the new food and contact your baby's health care provider. These symptoms may indicate a food allergy.   In 2008, the American Academy of Pediatrics published the following guidelines for infants ""at risk"" of developing an allergy based on evidence from current research. Infants are considered at risk if they have one first-degree relative with an allergic disorder (such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis or food allergy).     Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 months decreases the incidence of atopic dermatitis, cow's milk allergy and wheezing in early life when compared with feeding infants cow's milk-based formula.   The use of soy-based infant formula does not appear to play a role in allergy prevention.   Solid foods should not be introduced before 4 to 6 months of age. Delaying the introduction of solid foods beyond 4 to 6 months of age does not appear to provide significant protective effect from developing food allergies.   At this time there is insufficient evidence to recommend further dietary interventions such as avoiding specific foods (including fish, eggs or peanuts) during pregnancy, breastfeeding or beyond 4 to 6 months of age to protect against the development of food allergies.     Food Texture   Textures are very important for introducing foods. Most babies prefer to start with softer, smoother textures and gradually move toward thicker foods. Firm foods, especially round foods, slippery foods and sticky foods are choking hazards.  To avoid choking, dont offer the following foods to children under 4 years of age:      Popcorn   Peanuts   Nuts and seeds   Whole grapes, cherry tomatoes   Whole kernel corn   Olives   Hot dogs   Hard, raw fruits or vegetables such as apples, celery and carrots   Chunks of meat or poultry   Sticky foods, such as peanut butter, which can get stuck in the back of the mouth   Hard candy, gum drops and jelly beans     For toddlers and preschoolers, chop grapes, meat, poultry, hot dogs, and raw vegetables and fruits into small pieces (about  inch or smaller).   Nurturing Healthy Relationships with Food   Establishing a positive feeding relationship during infancy can have lifetime benefits. According to registered dietitian and child feeding expert Ellyn Satter, the key to a healthy feeding relationship is the appropriate division of responsibility.   Adult Responsibilities   Adults are responsible for what food is present and how it is presented.     Choose foods that are the right texture so your baby's tongue and mouth can control it and swallow easily.   Hold your baby on your lap when you first introduce solid foods. Then move your baby to a safe high chair.   Support your baby well in an upright position so he or she can easily explore the food as much as desired.   Have your baby sit up straight and face forward. This makes swallowing easier and choking less likely.   Talk in a quiet, encouraging voice while you feed. Theres no need to be entertaining. Babies are easily overwhelmed and distracted with games.     Child Responsibilities   Children are responsible for how much and whether they eat.     Wait for your baby to pay attention to each spoonful before you feed it.   Let your baby touch the food in the dish and on the spoon. You wouldn't want to eat something if you didn't know anything about it, would you?   Feed at your baby's tempo. Don't make your baby eat faster or slower than he or she wants.   Allow your baby to self-feed with finger foods as soon as he or she shows an interest in touching or holding them.   Stop feeding when your baby shows you cues that he or she is done. Often, your baby will do this by turning his or her head away from you.

Breast milk or infant formula generally will supply enough fluid.   If your child is sick with diarrhea or vomiting, check with your pediatrician about replacing fluids. Diarrhea and vomiting can lead to dehydration  and it's complications  if fluids aren't replaced. Rather than water or juice, your doctor or pediatric nurse may recommend an oral electrolyte maintenance solution, sold near baby foods in your grocery store, to prevent dehydration. Besides fluid, the solution contains glucose (a form of sugar) and minerals (sodium, chloride and potassium) called electrolytes. Electrolytes help maintain fluid balance in your baby's body cells. These minerals are lost through body fluids.   Consult your doctor or pediatric nurse before feeding an oral electrolyte maintenance solution to children under two years of age (or older children, too). Besides the risk of dehydration, diarrhea and vomiting signal possible illness that may require medical attention! If diarrhea, vomiting or fever persist longer than 24 hours, consult your doctor or pediatric nurse. An electrolyte maintenance solution won't stop diarrhea or vomiting, but it does prevent dehydration.

While some infant formulas are made from cow's milk, it has been modified for infants.   The high protein content of unmodified cow's milk is hard for a baby's immune system to digest and process, and potassium and sodium contents are also higher than the recommended levels for babies.   Cow's milk is low in iron and doesn't provide infants with enough zinc, vitamins C and E, copper and essential fatty acids  all nutrients that babies need to grow and develop.   Breast milk is the best source of nutrients for your infant, but, for many mothers, breast-feeding isn't always an option.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Starting your baby on solid foods is exciting  and messy! Most babies start with a very small amount of solids at around 4 to 6 months old, slowly increasing their portion size. Then, at around 9 to 11 months old, you may start noticing a dramatic drop in how much breast milk or formula your baby drinks as he or she starts getting more nutrition and calories from solid foods.   Because of their changing dietary needs over this transition, it is important that infants get the nutrition they need to grow and develop.  For some children, this means filling nutritional gaps with carefully chosen supplements.     Iron   Babies are born with a store of iron that lasts them for about 4 to 6 months. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that full-term infants who are exclusively breast-fed be given an iron supplement starting at 4 months of age. Talk to your pediatrician to see if your infant needs an iron supplement. Children born premature or with a low birth weight may have reduced iron stores. If so, your pediatrician will probably recommend iron supplements until your baby's first birthday. Formula is generally iron-fortified, which means formula-fed babies rarely need an iron supplement.   As infants begin to eat more solid food, serving them iron-rich foods such as iron-fortified cereal, meat or beans at least twice a day will help them meet their iron needs. But, if your baby is over 6 months old, is breast-fed and is not eating iron-rich foods, your pediatrician may recommend an iron supplement.   To promote iron absorption from plant foods, combine iron-rich solid foods you serve to your child with vitamin C-rich foods in one meal. For example, pair a bean and rice puree or finger food meal with tomato sauce, fruit or a fruit puree.   Vitamin D   Vitamin D is important for healthy bones and prevention of chronic disease. Because low levels of vitamin D are so common, the American Academy of Pediatrics says all breast-fed infants  and formula-fed infants who drink less than 32 ounces of formula per day  should take a supplement. When starting solids, you can mix vitamin D drops in purees as well as add them to formula or water.   Fluoride   Before you determine if your baby needs fluoride, which is important for cavity prevention, you need to know levels of fluoride in your local water supply. Fluoride supplements are only available by prescription, so discuss this with your pediatrician.   Vitamin B 12   Vitamin B 12 , which prevents anemia and supports healthy neurological function, is found in animal products such as meat, fish, eggs and dairy, and is not a concern for most children. However, if you plan to introduce only plant-based foods into your child's diet, he or she may need a B 12  supplement. Formula-fed vegan babies can get their vitamin B 12  from a special fortified formula, most often soy-based. Vegan mothers who exclusively breast-feed should be sure to consume adequate vitamin B 12  through fortified foods and supplements in order to provide ample B 12  to her baby via breast milk.Vitamin B 12  is typically included in most over-the-counter infant vitamin drops and many ready-to-eat cereals and milk substitutes.   Before giving your infant any supplements, always consult with your pediatrician. Not all infants automatically need supplements when starting solids. Make sure to introduce your baby to a variety of foods in order to develop his or her palate and meet nutritional needs.

What You Eat and Drink Matters   By Wendy Marcason, RDN       Published February 01, 2014           Print   Email                March is  National Nutrition Month , when the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reminds everyone to return to the basics of healthy eating. It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Human breast milk is the perfect nutrition source for an infant. It strikes a balance of carbohydrates, protein, fat, water and nutrients. It's easily digested and absorbed, and its composition naturally changes as a baby's developmental needs change.   And because mother's milk is a rich in antibodies, it builds a baby's immune system into a robust defense force. But does what a mother eats or drinks impact the milk she breast-feeds her child?    According to Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Spokesperson Jessica Crandall, RDN, CDE, nursing babies are unlikely to develop a food allergy from breast-feeding. ""But some foods may not agree with the infant,"" she says. ""Some common foods nursing mothers should avoid if the infant is fussy during feedings are: spicy foods or foods like cabbage and broccoli."" If this happens, avoid that particular food for a while.   Keep Hydrated   As a nursing mother, you should consume between 13 and 16 cups (104 to 128 ounces) of fluids a day  this includes fluids from food, by the way  to compensate for the extra water that is used up making milk. One way to ensure you're hydrated is to drink a large glass of water while breast-feeding your baby.   For the most part, a baby doesn't typically need anything but her mother's milk to stay hydrated. ""Under ordinary conditions, breast milk does supply adequate amounts of water,"" Crandall says.   If your infant appears dehydrated due to vomiting or diarrhea that lasts 24 hours or more, consult your pediatrician.   What about Caffeine?   A recent study published by the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that a mother who drinks small amounts of coffee is unlikely to affect either her unborn child or her nursing newborn's sleep patterns.   About 300 milligrams of caffeine a day  the amount found in approximately 24 ounces of coffee; seven shots of espresso; or seven 12-ounce cans of cola  is not considered enough to cause adverse effects for nursing mothers. Some women, however, find that their sensitivity to caffeine increases during pregnancy.   Alcohol during Nursing   If you breast-feed, it's best to abstain from alcohol. If your baby's breast-feeding behavior is well established, consistent, and predictable (no earlier than at 3 months of age), a mother may consume a single alcoholic drink if she then waits two hours or longer before breast-feeding.   If you do decide to have that glass of wine or beer, Crandall says there are some steps you can take to make sure it does not interfere with nursing. ""To ward off dehydration, be sure to down a glass of water in addition to the alcoholic drink,"" she says.   And because it can take a few hours for alcohol to fully clear from your body, preparation and timing of a nursing mother's drink is key. ""Eat beforehand, or when you're having your drink, as this will help lower the amount of alcohol in your blood and your milk,"" Crandall says. ""You can time your drink so that your baby won't be nursing for a few hours afterwards by having it right after a feeding, for example, or during one of your baby's longer stretches of sleep. Another option would be for you to bottle-feed your baby previously expressed breast milk.""   Is Fish OK?   While breast-feeding, reduce your exposure to known chemical contaminants such as mercury. Large bottom-dwelling fish are the most common food source of mercury. Avoid shark, swordfish, mackerel, and tilefish; eat up to 12 ounces of other kinds of fish every week with a maximum of 6 ounces albacore tuna per week; and check local advisories about eating locally caught fish. If no advice is posted, limit your intake of locally caught fish to 6 ounces per week and consume no other fish during that same week.

Anyone can get food poisoning, but babies and toddlers are at especially high risk and once they become infected, young children can have a hard time getting well. The good news is that food poisoning can be avoided with a few simple steps.   Foods Young Children Should Avoid   Infants and young children are very vulnerable to food poisoning because their immune systems aren't developed enough to fight foodborne infections. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, very young children experience a higher rate of hospitalization due to foodborne infection than that of children over age 3. Remember to safely handle and prepare food when feeding young children.   When feeding young children, always avoid:     Unpasteurized milk or any unpasteurized dairy products   Raw or partially cooked eggs or foods containing raw eggs   Raw or undercooked meat and poultry   Raw and undercooked fish or shellfish   Unpasteurized juices   Raw sprouts   Honey  avoid until after the baby's first birthday because it can harbor spores of toxic bacterium that can cause  botulism , a severe foodborne illness caused by a bacterium which occurs in soil.     In addition, avoid feeding baby food straight from the jar because this ""double dipping"" introduces bacteria from your baby's mouth to the spoon and into the food. The bacteria could then grow in the leftovers and result in food poisoning. Instead, spoon baby food from the jar into a separate feeding dish and feed from the new dish. Throw away all uneaten food from the dish. You can cap and refrigerate (to 40F or below) open jars of baby food that have not come in contact with your baby's saliva.   You can save:     Opened strained fruits for two to three days   Strained meats for one day   Vegetable and meat combinations for two days   Unopened jars of baby food have the same shelf life as other canned foods.

Just because kids have teeth does not mean they can handle all types of foods.   In order to avoid choking, don't offer these foods to children younger than four:     Small hard foods:  including nuts, seeds, popcorn, dry flake cereal, chips, pretzels, raw carrots, raw celery, raw peas, whole olives, raw peeled apple and pear slices, cherries with pits, cherry tomatoes and whole kernel corn. Note: You can break these foods into  inch pieces for toddlers but do not feed them whole.   Slippery foods:  including whole grapes, large pieces of meats and poultry, and hard candy like lollipops and cough drops. Note: Chop grapes, meat, poultry, hot dogs and other food into small pieces.   Sticky foods: including peanut butter, gum, taffy, gummy candies, caramels, marshmallows, jelly beans, dried fruits and fruit leathers.    Instead, practice food safety when feeding young children:    Offer finger foods like pieces of bananas, graham crackers strips of cheese or bagels to toddlers   Watch young children while they are eating   Insist children sit to eat and drink, and not lie down, walk or run   Encourage children to take their time and chew well   Look for warning labels on food with high choking risks   Be prepared to do first aid for choking quickly.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Breast-feeding has big benefits for both mother and baby. It strengthens baby's immune system, encourages bonding, saves money and even helps mom shed pregnancy weight. Plus, breast milk is naturally fresh, readily available and always arrives at the perfect temperature. Here's how to keep it as pure and safe as possible:   1. Make cleanliness a top priority:  While breast milk is naturally bacteria free, you'll want to keep it that way. ""After it's expressed, milk can be contaminated by bacteria on the breast shield or the bottle,"" says registered dietitian nutritionist Melinda Johnson. ""So mom should wash her hands first and to always use bottles and a breast shield that are completely clean."" While collecting milk in plastic or formula bottle bags may be tempting, these can drip and spill. Instead opt for bottles with screw caps or bags that are specially designed to fit inside of a baby's bottle.   2. Store it safely:  After it's expressed, breast milk can safely stay at room temperatures for four hours. After that, move it to the refrigerator where it will stay fresh for 48 hours. And never add fresh breast milk to a container that contains older milk. To prolong freshness, you can freeze it for three to six months at temperatures below 0F. ""It's a good idea to date each bottle, so you can keep an eye on how long it's been stored,"" Johnson says. ""Storing it in smaller portions makes it easier to reheat what you need without having to throw away milk that isn't used.""   3. Reheat with care:  ""When reheating stored breast milk, the goal is to take the chill off but not get it hot, which can burn baby's tender mouth,"" Johnson says. Although it may seem innocent enough, microwaving milk can cause hot spots. It can also destroy some of breast milk's precious proteins and vitamins. Instead, gently warm it in a bowl of warm water. If you're defrosting frozen milk, you should thaw it in the refrigerator or a bowl of warm water.   4. When in doubt, toss it out:  Once breast milk has been defrosted, it should be used within 24 hours or discarded. ""Milk that's been thawed should never be refrozen,"" Johnson says. ""If you're not able to store milk properly or there's any question as to its safety, throw it out.""

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Omega-3 fats are essential fats, meaning you can only get them from your diet. If you're pregnant, they may take on a greater level of ""essential-ness."" Many studies suggest these fats, particularly eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), bring several benefits to both moms-to-be and the babies they carry.   Fish is the richest source of DHA and EPA, but most Americans eat very little fish. In fact, recent surveys show the average person consumes about three ounces of fish a week  pregnant women eating barely two ounces.   Several groups, including the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology, recommend women who are pregnant eat 8 to 12 ounces of fish and seafood a week to help get an adequate amount of EPA and DHA for their babies. Yet, often women shy away from doing so because of concerns about contaminants in fish, such as mercury. Too much mercury in the body during pregnancy can harm a developing baby's brain and nervous system.   Benefits vs. Risk   Fish is an excellent source of protein, provides several vitamins and minerals, and is low in saturated fat  all of which are good attributes for being healthy. Omega-3s ramp up the health aspects for pregnant women by potentially reducing the risk of premature delivery and improving brain and vision development in the baby.   What's a Pregnant Woman to Do?   Bridget Swinney, MS, RD, author of  Eating Expectantly: Practical Advice for Healthy Eating Before, During and After Pregnancy , says to eat fish. ""There is so much misinformation about eating fish during pregnancy. There are plenty of low-mercury, low-contaminant fish to choose from and the consensus from scientists is that the benefits of eating 12 ounces a week of low contaminant fish outweigh risks."" Swinney encourages women to use the growing number of resources available to help feel more comfortable doing so. ""Whether it's at your grocery store, at a restaurant or through your own community's health department, you can learn where your fish comes from, how it's raised and how it's harvested, which will make you more confident in your choices."" Knowledge is power, adds Swinney. ""The more you know, the better you and your baby will eat.""   What about vegetarians? Because of DHA's beneficial effects on reducing the risk of premature delivery and improving infant brain and vision development, pregnant vegetarians should choose DHA-fortified foods or eggs from hens fed DHA-rich microalgae or use a microalgae-derived DHA supplement. For more information about appropriate supplement use, consult your doctor.   Fish Rich in Omega-3s and Considered Lower Risk for Contaminants   (Includes DHA and EPA levels for 3 ounces of fish)      Anchovies (2,000 mg)   Bass     Striped (950 mg)   Freshwater (700 mg)       Halibut (cooked)    Atlantic (400 mg)       Herring (2,000 mg)   Mussels (blue) (800 mg)   Oysters (Pacific) (1,400 mg)   Salmon (800-1,700 mg)   Trout (900-1,100 mg)   Tuna (up to 6 oz./week)    Bluefin (1,500 mg)   Canned (1,000 mg)   Canned, light (270 mg)   Albacore    Yellowfin (300 mg)           Whitefish (1,600 mg)     * King mackerel, shark, swordfish and tilefish are rich in omega-3s, but contain higher levels of mercury and should be avoided.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    While breast-feeding is nature's way of providing ideal nutrition for infants, the ""art"" of breast-feeding might not come as naturally. Like learning any new skill, the keys to success are knowledge, practice and the support of family, friends, and perhaps coworkers and employers. Discuss your decision to breast-feed with your doctor before delivery and remind hospital staff when you arrive at the hospital.     To build confidence and to help ensure an adequate milk supply, start nursing as soon after delivery as possible. The best time to start is within 20 to 30 minutes after your baby is born, perhaps right in the delivery room. The first feeding will be short, about 10 minutes. ""Rooming in"" at the hospital may make your first days with nursing more successful.   Relax and make yourself comfortable. Find a comfortable chair with good arm and back support. Or lie down with pillows strategically positioned to help you support your baby. If you are comfortable and well supported, it's easy to hold your baby and you won't feel much tension in your neck, back and shoulders.   Plan to nurse on demand  that is, whenever your baby says it's time to eat. Increased alertness or activity, rooting toward your breast or mouthing are all signs that your baby is hungry. Typically, crying is a late signal of hunger. Trying to establish a schedule early on may frustrate you both. As reassurance, you can't ""spoil"" your baby by feeding on demand. Most babies fall into a schedule with time.   Be prepared to nurse very frequently during the first month  about eight to 12 times every 24 hours. That's because a newborn's stomach is small and because nutrient needs are exceptional now during rapid growth and development. Frequent nursing helps establish your milk supply and keeps your breasts from becoming hard and swollen. Full and heavy breasts signal that it's time to nurse. As milk ""lets down,"" or moves from the inner breast to the nipple, you may feel a tingling feeling.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    The 40 (or so) weeks of pregnancy are a magical time. Keeping a healthy lifestyle throughout pregnancy, as well as before and after, is key for both baby and mother. Important steps to a healthy pregnancy include eating a balanced diet; gaining the right amount of weight; enjoying regular physical activity; taking a vitamin and mineral supplement if recommended by a physician; and avoiding alcohol, tobacco and other harmful substances.   Foods Fit for Mom and Baby     Moms-to-be need a variety of foods from all the  MyPlate  food groups. A balanced diet with a variety of foods can provide healthy women with enough nutrients for pregnancy. Safe food practices are important, too,  since pregnant women are at higher risk of food poisoning .   Pregnant women need a balanced diet including:     Whole grains:  Breads, cereals, pastas and brown rice.   Fruits:  All types of fruits, fresh, frozen or canned without added sugars.   Vegetables:  Eat a variety of colorful vegetables, fresh, frozen or canned with no added salt. Raw sprouts should be avoided.   Lean protein:  Choose lean protein from meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans and peas, peanut butter, soy products and nuts. Pregnant women should avoid eating tilefish, shark, swordfish and king mackerel, and limit white (albacore) tuna to 6 ounces per week. Deli, luncheon meats and hot dogs should be reheated if consumed.   Low-fat or fat-free dairy:  This includes milk, cheese and yogurt. Unpasteurized milk and some soft cheeses that are made from unpasteurized milk also should be avoided.   Healthful fats:  From foods such as avocados, nuts and seeds as well as vegetable oils including canola and olive oil.     Avoid extra calories from added sugars and solid fats, which can lead to  unhealthy weight gain . Cut down on foods such as regular soda, sweets and fried snacks.   Key Nutrients for Healthy Pregnancy     Folic Acid:  Folic acid reduces the risk of birth defects that affect the spinal cord. All women of childbearing age and pregnant women should consume at least 400 micrograms of folic acid each day. Natural food sources of folate include legumes, green leafy vegetables and citrus fruits. Folate also can be obtained through fortified foods such as cereals, pastas and bread as well as supplements.   Iron:  Maternal iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency during pregnancy. Pregnant women need at least 27 milligrams of iron each day. Foods with high and moderate amounts of iron include red meat, chicken and fish, fortified cereals, spinach, some leafy greens and beans. For vegetarians and women who do not eat a lot of meat, increase iron absorption by combining plant-based sources of iron with vitamin C-rich foods. For example, try spinach salad with mandarin oranges or cereal with strawberries.   Calcium:  During pregnancy, calcium is needed for the healthy development of a baby's teeth, bones, heart, nerves and muscles. When a pregnant woman does not consume enough calcium, it is taken from her bones for the baby. It is important to consume adequate amounts of calcium daily before, during and after pregnancy. The recommended amount of calcium during pregnancy is 1,300 milligrams per day for adolescents 14 to 18 years old and 1,000 milligrams per day for women aged 19 to 50. That means at least three daily servings of calcium-rich foods such as low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt or cheese or calcium-fortified plant-based beverages, cereals and juices.     Your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist may recommend a prenatal vitamin/mineral supplement to help ensure that you get enough iron, folic acid and other nutrients.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Eating for two doesn't mean eating more, it means eating better. Thinking beyond calories  and considering the nutrients necessary to keep mom healthy while providing the proper nutrition for the growth of the baby  will ensure a smooth pregnancy and will set your baby up for a healthier life.   Keeping it Balanced   Standard recommendations for pregnancy nutrition rely on a well-balanced, nutrient-rich diet. Including a variety of foods from all five food groups  fruits, vegetables, grains, protein and dairy  is essential.   Vegetables, fruits and whole grains should be the foundation of the diet. Plant foods provide all-star prenatal vitamins, minerals and phytonutrients such as folate for preventing neural tube defects, iron to sustain the increased blood volume and calcium for bone formation and fluid regulation. These foods also offer a steady supply of fiber which is crucial for maintaining healthy digestion during pregnancy.   Because the structural components of body cells  your baby's and yours  are mostly protein, it's also essential that women get enough protein during their entire pregnancy. The Academy recommends eating an additional 1 to 2 ounces of protein daily, for a total of 5 to 6 ounces a day. Good sources include eggs, beans, nuts and seeds, poultry, lean meats, low-fat milk, yogurt and cheese.   Certain fish, including tilefish, shark, swordfish and king mackerel, should not be eaten during pregnancy due to their high mercury levels. However, salmon, trout, anchovies and sardines are all safe for soon-to-be moms, providing omega-3 fatty acids which contribute to brain development without the harmful mercury. Aim for 8 to 12 ounces of fish per week during pregnancy.   Eating for Pregnancy Symptoms   While a well-balanced diet is ideal, it's not always realistic. Every woman experiences some degree of nausea, food aversions, constipation and bloating during pregnancy. So, the eating strategy at times may become focused on coping. These tips can help keep symptoms at bay.   Nausea     Eat small, frequent meals to keep blood sugar stable and prevent nausea from occurring.   Stay well hydrated by drinking plenty of water.   Sipping on ginger ale may help settle an upset stomach. Speak with a physician before consuming herbal teas during pregnancy.     Gas, Bloating and Constipation     Consume a steady intake of fiber from whole grains, fruits and vegetables.   Avoid beans and other gas-producing foods during flare-ups.   Maintain a low-impact exercise routine.     Heartburn and Indigestion     Steer clear of spicy foods, which can be a trigger.   Avoid laying down for three hours after eating.   Maintain good posture to enhance digestion.     Proper nutrition can be a game changer during pregnancy, offering a reprieve from some of the most unpleasant symptoms while giving your baby a healthy head start. When it comes to making healthier food choices during pregnancy, your baby's health depends on it  and so does yours!

Small, hard foods, slippery foods and sticky foods can block the air passage, cutting off a child's supply of oxygen.      Don't offer these foods to children younger than three or four years of age:       Small, hard foods   nuts, seeds, popcorn, snack chips, pretzels, raw carrots, raw celery, raw peas, whole olives, cherry tomatoes, snack puffs, raisins. For toddlers and preschoolers, cut foods into slightly larger pieces that they can bite and chew, but not put whole into their mouths.     Slippery foods   whole grapes; large pieces of meats, poultry and frankfurter; and hard candy, lollipops and cough drops, which may be swallowed before they're adequately chewed. Chop grapes, meat, poultry, hot dogs and other foods in small pieces. Avoid offering chewing gum.       Be careful with sticky foods, too, such as peanut butter. Spread only a thin layer on bread.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    As if there weren't enough to think about with a new baby, many moms experience anxiety about losing pregnancy weight after childbirth. While women may be hard on themselves in a world of instant gratification and celebrity obsession, it's best to concentrate on planning for healthy post-partum weight loss.   Not surprisingly, prevention is the best strategy for weight control. Mothers still in the planning stages should strive to gain a healthy amount of weight during pregnancy (25 to 35 pounds), making it a little easier to rebound post-partum.   The first several months post-partum, however, is not the ideal time for a drastic weight-loss program. ""The first month after pregnancy is really a time of recovery and rebuilding the body from the trauma of childbirth,"" says Tara Gidus, MS, registered dietitian and author. ""Stay hydrated, drink plenty of water and eat protein to keep you satisfied and to assist in repairing those cells.""   The most healthful and sustainable strategy to return to pre-pregnancy weight is by making gradual, permanent changes in eating habits.   Choosing Right   As a new mom, or even if this isn't your first rodeo, you'll need plenty of energy to take care of baby. Choosing the right foods  fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean protein and dairy  is especially important if you are breast-feeding. To ensure adequate milk supply, you'll need to meet your energy needs and include essential nutrients. For most post-partum women, calorie intake should be in the 1,800 to 2,200 range, and Gidus recommends an extra 300 to 400 calories more per day while lactating, depending on how much milk you are producing. ""Breast milk is also high in fat content, and the fat often comes from maternal stores that were added during pregnancy,"" says Gidus. Consider this a bonus when it comes to shedding pounds post-partum!   Rather than count calories, focus on choosing foods that are nutrient-rich. If you find yourself losing more than a pound per week, you probably should add a few nutritious calories into your diet. If you gained more than 35 pounds during your pregnancy, it may take up to a year or more to bounce back, but you can do it!   6 Tips for Mom's Healthy Meal Plan     Don't skip meals.   Drink at least 6 to 8 glasses of water. If breast-feeding, get into the habit of filling a tall glass of water to keep with you all day.   You need 1,000 milligrams of calcium daily. You can get this easily by consuming three servings of low-fat or fat-free dairy throughout the day.   Consume at least 2 cups of fruits and 2 cups of vegetables.   Include protein at each meal.   Plan healthy snacks (fresh fruit, nuts, Greek yogurt with granola, hummus with vegetables, or a protein bar).     Getting Back to Exercising   Katie Serbinski, MS, RD, tells her clients that the weight will come off, but baby's health and nutrition should be the priority. ""Establish a breast-feeding or bottle feeding schedule before thinking about a weight loss plan,"" she says. Serbinski also recommends waiting until the baby is 6 to 8 weeks old before beginning to work out regularly. At that point, walking may be the perfect post-partum activity because it's easy to do, not strenuous and can include baby. You can incorporate weightlifting or a resistance routine (such as yoga or using exercise bands) once you lose your initial weight and your baby is a little older, but to start, aim for a daily 2- to 4-mile walk with your baby and stroller.   Avoiding Weight Loss Fads   After bringing your baby home from the hospital, it's easy to slip into the ""I want to lose weight fast!"" mentality. Some quick weight loss plans may be tempting as you stand (often sleep-deprived) in the grocery store check-out line and see images of thin celebrity moms on magazine covers.   Say no to these fad diets:     Baby Food Diet.  You guessed it  this diet encourages mom to join baby with pureed baby food for breakfast and lunch (14 servings), and then a sensible dinner. This fad diet lacks important adult nutrients, including adequate amounts of fiber and fat, and is not healthy or sustainable.   Mono diet . This involves eating the same exact foods every day, or only eating one food for all meals in a single day. Not only will this deprive mothers of important nutrients, but also will likely result in a diet that is too low in protein and calories, so weight loss likely will be a loss of muscle mass.   The OMG Diet.  This fad diet encourages intake of any kind of carbohydrate (which is too simplistic and unbalanced) and discourages exercise, breakfast and certain fruits. Any very low-calorie diet  1,200 calories or less  that requires liquid meals and is very restrictive is a bad idea.

With more physical activity, mother's may need more; the actual amount depends on the duration and the intensity of your workout.   For athletes and non-athletes alike, the USDA Food Patterns offer guidance for planning a varied, balanced and moderate eating plan during breast-feeding. There is also a "" Daily Food Plan for Moms "" on ChooseMyPlate.gov.   Fluid needs increase during breast-feeding, too. Without exercise, breast-feeding moms need about 8 to 12 cups per day from food, beverages and drinking water. When working out, drink even more.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) agree: Well-planned vegetarian and vegan eating patterns are healthy for infants and toddlers.   Time and attention are necessary to help young children, vegetarian or not, get all the nutrients they need for normal growth and development.   For the first six months, all babies do best with breast milk. Use iron-fortified formula (soy for vegans) if breast-feeding is decreased or stopped. Cow's milk, soy milk, rice milk and homemade formulas are not appropriate for babies during the first year because they have the wrong ratio of protein, fat and carbohydrate. They are also missing important nutrients for health, growth and development.   Solid foods can be introduced in the same way as for non-vegetarian infants. Replace meat with mashed or pureed tofu or beans and soy or dairy yogurt and cheese. (See  Introducing Solid Foods .)   Since breast milk is such a rich source of nutrients, vegan mothers may want to breast-feed for more than one year. Wean vegan infants with soy milk fortified with calcium and vitamins B12 and D. Milk alternatives, such as soy, rice, almond, hemp, etc., are not recommended during the first year of life as a primary drink because it is low in both protein and energy.   Nutrients Needing Special Attention   When feeding vegetarian or vegan children, pay close attention to the following nutrients:     Vitamin B12:  Vegetarians can get plenty of B12 from milk products and eggs. Vegans, both breast-feeding moms and children, need a good source of B12. Options include a supplement or fortified foods such as soy beverages, cereals and meat substitutes.   Vitamin D:  The AAP recommends all breast-fed infants receive 400 IU per day of supplemental vitamin D starting shortly after birth. This should continue until your child consumes the same amount of vitamin D from fortified milk: at least one quart per day of cow or soy milk.   Calcium:  Breast- and formula-fed babies, as well as toddlers who consume milk and dairy foods, usually get plenty of additional calcium from foods including yogurt and cheese. For vegan toddlers, calcium-fortified foods and beverages or supplements may be necessary. See a registered dietitian nutritionist for advice.   Iron:  The iron content of breast milk is low, even if moms are eating well. Babies are born with enough iron for 4 to 6 months. After this age, vegetarian and vegan infants need an outside source. Options include iron-fortified cereals or supplements.   Protein:  Babies need plenty of protein for rapid growth during the first year. Protein needs can be met with breast milk or formula until about 8 months. After that, add plant proteins from beans and cereals and fortified soy milks. Lacto-ovo toddlers can get protein from yogurt and eggs.   Fiber:  Lots of fiber can fill toddlers up quickly. Provide frequent meals and snacks. Use some refined grains, such as fortified cereals, breads and pasta, and higher-fat plant foods including sunflower butter and avocados to help vegetarian children meet their energy and nutrient needs.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Tangor, ugli, jostaberry and pluot  these are just a few curiously named hybrid fruits found at the grocery store or farmers market. With bizarre names, hybrids might sound like weird science, but these fruits and their many cousins are more natural and familiar than you might think.   Hybrids don't use genetically modified organism technology. ""Hybrids use traditional pollination that can ordinarily occur in nature,"" explains Leith Gardner of Zaiger's Inc. Genetics, whose father started hand-pollinating stone-fruit flowers using a small pollen-dusted brush over 50 years ago.   With controlled pollination, cultivars can breed new generations of fruiting plants with increasingly desirable characteristics. ""Once a satisfactory variety's achieved, hybridization produces that exact variety, which would randomly occur in nature, but in a shorter time,"" says Gardner.   Farmers benefit from hybridized fruit plants that are naturally disease resistant and hearty in heat, cold and drought  in addition to producing consistent, higher yields with predictable fruit maturation times. As a result, consumers benefit from unique, uniform fruit sizes and shapes, increased juiciness, improved taste and better nutrition.   Here are 10 hybrid fruits to add to your shopping list.   Tangor:  A cross between a mandarin and an orange  the tangor may sound unfamiliar, but varieties such as murcott and temple have been hitting the produce department of local grocery stores.   Ugli :  Botanically  Citrus reticulata x paradisi , the ""ugly"" hybrid of a grapefruit, orange and tangerine, this tangelo from Jamaica reflects more sweet flavors from its tangerine ancestry rather than bitter grapefruit. Add uglis, halved or sectioned, to a salad with avocado, sweet onion, chicory and radicchio.   Jostaberry:  Sweeter than its North American and European gooseberry and black currant parents, the jostaberry is a rich, almost black berry with grape, blueberry and kiwi flavors and packed with vitamin C.   Pluot:  A Zaiger trademarked plum and apricot hybrid, it's bred for smooth skin and super juicy, sweet flesh. ""Breeding more red flecks into a fruit [as with the pluot] increases antioxidants,"" says Gardner.   Baby Kiwi :  The lineage of the baby kiwi traces back to fuzzy kiwifruit, also known as the Chinese gooseberry. With smooth skin that doesn't need to be peeled, the typically berry-sized baby kiwi can vary in size, shape, color and taste between producers.   Tayberry :  A cross between a red raspberry and blackberry, the tayberry looks like an elongated raspberry with tart flavor.   Limequat :  This ripe key lime and kumquat hybrid resembles a miniature oval orange with greenish-yellow skin. In season from mid-fall to winter, limequats  with its tart key lime flavor can be eaten whole, in jams or accompanying fish or chicken.   Pineberry:  A novel cross between white strawberries from Southern Europe and cultivated red strawberries produce this pineapple-flavored berry, typically available early May through June.   Orangelo:  This hybrid, believed to be of Puerto Rican origin, is a cross between a grapefruit and an orange, and is sweeter and more vivid than its grapefruit parent, however, eaten in much the same way.   Carambola:  Also known as star fruit, the carambola is fine to eat in its entirety and can vary between sweet and tart depending on type. The star-shaped slices make the carambola perfect to garnish mocktails, add to fruit kabobs and salads or complement spicy, savory grilled fare.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Handling food properly is essential to reducing the risk of food poisoning, especially during pregnancy. During pregnancy your immune system is weakened while your growing baby's immune system is undeveloped, making it much harder for both of you to fight off harmful pathogens. Therefore, food poisoning can cause serious or even life-threatening health problems for both mother and baby.   Pregnant women are especially susceptible to three specific foodborne risks:       Listeria :  A harmful bacterium that can grow at refrigerator temperatures where most other bacteria do not grow.  Listeria  causes an illness called listeriosis, and pregnant woman are 20 times more likely than other healthy adults to get this illness.  Listeria  is found in refrigerated, ready-to-eat foods such as hot dogs and deli meats and unpasteurized (raw) milk and unpasteurized dairy products like soft cheeses. In order to prevent  Listeria , cook all foods to proper temperatures; reheat pre-cooked foods and deli meats to 165F; avoid unpasteurized dairy products and smoked seafood; and thoroughly wash raw fruits and vegetables.       Methylmercury : A metal that can be found in certain fish and at high levels can be harmful to an unborn baby's developing nervous system. High levels of methylmercury are found in large, long-lived fish such as shark, tilefish, king mackerel and swordfish, so be sure to avoid these fish. Pregnant women can eat other cooked seafood in moderation, including up to 12 ounces (2 average meals) per week of lower mercury seafood. These options include shrimp, canned light tuna, salmon, Pollock and catfish.  Note:  Albacore ""white"" tuna has more mercury than canned light tuna so only eat up to 6 ounces (one average meal) of albacore tuna per week.       Toxoplasma :  A harmful parasite that causes an illness called toxoplasmosis that can be difficult to detect.  Toxoplasma  can be found in raw and undercooked meat, unwashed fruits and vegetables, soil and dirty cat litter boxes and other places where cat feces can be found. For this reason, cook food to safe temperatures, freeze meat properly, peel and wash fruits and vegetables before eating, maintain clean cutting boards and always wash your hands thoroughly with soap and water. In addition, take extra caution and wear gloves when cleaning a cat litter box, gardening or handling sand from a sandbox. If possible, avoid getting a new cat while pregnant or have someone else clean the litter box.       In order to avoid these food poisoning risks, be sure to handle food properly and follow the Four Easy Steps: 1) wash hands often; 2) keep ready-to-eat foods separate from raw meat, poultry, seafood and eggs; 3) cook to proper temperatures; and 4) refrigerate promptly at 40 degrees Fahrenheit or below.   In addition, when you're out shopping to satisfy your latest pregnancy craving, keep this  checklist  handy and avoid the following high riskfoods. And when preparing food, be sure to use a  food thermometer  to ensure that foods have been heated (or reheated) to a safe minimum internal temperature.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    When it comes to conceiving a baby, diet and lifestyle are just as important for men as for women.   One-third of the cases of infertility are related to the male partner, with some of the most common causes of sperm-related infertility including low sperm count, slow moving sperm, abnormal shape and size of sperm and problems with semen.   Diet and lifestyle choices can affect the health of a man's sperm, so use the following information to guide you in making healthy choices.   Eating for Fertility     Get Your Fruits and Vegetables   Color your plate with at least 2 cups of vegetables and 2 cups of fruit: leafy greens, purple and yellow vegetables, apples, oranges, kiwi, blueberries and melon.   Choose Whole Grains   Eat at least half of all grains as whole grains each day, such as a bowl of oatmeal in the morning, whole-grain bread at lunch and brown rice with dinner.   Eat Low-Fat Dairy   Dairy products are full of calcium, vitamin D, potassium and protein  all nutrients that keep your body functioning well. Choose at least 3 servings of low-fat or fat-free dairy, such as 1 cup of milk or yogurt or 1 ounce of cheese each day.   Cut Down on Meat   Eat less red meat and choose leaner protein sources: fish, turkey, chicken breast or pork chops. Eat vegetable proteins including beans, nuts, seeds and tofu.   Be Smart about Fats   Limit saturated fats from meats, full-fat dairy products and fried foods. Replace with healthy fats. Snack on an ounce of walnuts or almonds each day, drizzle extra-virgin olive oil on roasted vegetables and salads or add avocado to your sandwich.     Other Healthy Lifestyle Choices for Conception     Don't Drink Too Much Alcohol   Over-consuming alcohol is linked with poor production of normal, healthy sperm. If you drink alcohol, follow these guidelines for men: no more than two drinks a day (one drink equals 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1 ounces of spirits).   Avoid Cigarettes and Marijuana   Tobacco use is linked with low sperm counts and slow moving sperm; smoking marijuana over a prolonged period of time can result in low sperm counts and poorly developed sperm.   Keep a Healthy Weight   Research has shown that overweight and obesity can lead to fertility problems by creating hormonal disturbances. Eat right and balance calorie intake with exercise. By eating fewer processed foods and more whole foods  such as fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, healthy fats and lean proteins  there's less room for mindless eating and empty calorie consumption. On the flip side, being underweight has negative effects on sperm, such as decreased count and poor function.   Exercise in Moderation   Aim to exercise five days a week for 30 minutes. Too much exercise has been shown to decrease testosterone, which can indirectly lower sperm counts. Avoid steroid use; it can affect fertility by causing testicular shrinkage.

Introducing Solid Foods to Toddlers
",http://www.eatright.org/resource/food/nutrition/dietary-guidelines-and-myplate/introducing-solid-foods-to-toddlers,"Introducing Solid Foods to Toddlers   By Dayle Hayes, MS, RD       Published January 31, 2014           Print   Email                March is  National Nutrition Month , when the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reminds everyone to return to the basics of healthy eating. It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    During the first two years, children move from exclusive breast or bottle feeding to eating table foods with the rest of the family. There are two important parts of this process:     What specific foods and textures to introduce at each age   How best to feed babies so they develop a healthy relationship with food.     Types of Foods   The order in which you introduce solid foods doesn't matter for most babies. The traditional progression has been single-grain cereals followed by vegetables, fruits and meats. While there is nothing wrong with this pattern, pureed meat or poultry actually may be the best first food to provide sources of iron and zinc.   Introduce one new food at a time and wait three to five days before starting another. If you notice diarrhea, vomiting or rashes, stop the new food and contact your baby's health care provider. These symptoms may indicate a food allergy.   In 2008, the American Academy of Pediatrics published the following guidelines for infants ""at risk"" of developing an allergy based on evidence from current research. Infants are considered at risk if they have one first-degree relative with an allergic disorder (such as asthma, atopic dermatitis, allergic rhinitis or food allergy).     Exclusive breastfeeding for at least 4 months decreases the incidence of atopic dermatitis, cow's milk allergy and wheezing in early life when compared with feeding infants cow's milk-based formula.   The use of soy-based infant formula does not appear to play a role in allergy prevention.   Solid foods should not be introduced before 4 to 6 months of age. Delaying the introduction of solid foods beyond 4 to 6 months of age does not appear to provide significant protective effect from developing food allergies.   At this time there is insufficient evidence to recommend further dietary interventions such as avoiding specific foods (including fish, eggs or peanuts) during pregnancy, breastfeeding or beyond 4 to 6 months of age to protect against the development of food allergies.     Food Texture   Textures are very important for introducing foods. Most babies prefer to start with softer, smoother textures and gradually move toward thicker foods. Firm foods, especially round foods, slippery foods and sticky foods are choking hazards.  To avoid choking, dont offer the following foods to children under 4 years of age:      Popcorn   Peanuts   Nuts and seeds   Whole grapes, cherry tomatoes   Whole kernel corn   Olives   Hot dogs   Hard, raw fruits or vegetables such as apples, celery and carrots   Chunks of meat or poultry   Sticky foods, such as peanut butter, which can get stuck in the back of the mouth   Hard candy, gum drops and jelly beans     For toddlers and preschoolers, chop grapes, meat, poultry, hot dogs, and raw vegetables and fruits into small pieces (about  inch or smaller).   Nurturing Healthy Relationships with Food   Establishing a positive feeding relationship during infancy can have lifetime benefits. According to registered dietitian and child feeding expert Ellyn Satter, the key to a healthy feeding relationship is the appropriate division of responsibility.   Adult Responsibilities   Adults are responsible for what food is present and how it is presented.     Choose foods that are the right texture so your baby's tongue and mouth can control it and swallow easily.   Hold your baby on your lap when you first introduce solid foods. Then move your baby to a safe high chair.   Support your baby well in an upright position so he or she can easily explore the food as much as desired.   Have your baby sit up straight and face forward. This makes swallowing easier and choking less likely.   Talk in a quiet, encouraging voice while you feed. Theres no need to be entertaining. Babies are easily overwhelmed and distracted with games.     Child Responsibilities   Children are responsible for how much and whether they eat.     Wait for your baby to pay attention to each spoonful before you feed it.   Let your baby touch the food in the dish and on the spoon. You wouldn't want to eat something if you didn't know anything about it, would you?   Feed at your baby's tempo. Don't make your baby eat faster or slower than he or she wants.   Allow your baby to self-feed with finger foods as soon as he or she shows an interest in touching or holding them.   Stop feeding when your baby shows you cues that he or she is done. Often, your baby will do this by turning his or her head away from you.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Newborns need no extra water. Breast milk or infant formula generally will supply enough fluid.   If your child is sick with diarrhea or vomiting, check with your pediatrician about replacing fluids. Diarrhea and vomiting can lead to dehydration  and it's complications  if fluids aren't replaced. Rather than water or juice, your doctor or pediatric nurse may recommend an oral electrolyte maintenance solution, sold near baby foods in your grocery store, to prevent dehydration. Besides fluid, the solution contains glucose (a form of sugar) and minerals (sodium, chloride and potassium) called electrolytes. Electrolytes help maintain fluid balance in your baby's body cells. These minerals are lost through body fluids.   Consult your doctor or pediatric nurse before feeding an oral electrolyte maintenance solution to children under two years of age (or older children, too). Besides the risk of dehydration, diarrhea and vomiting signal possible illness that may require medical attention! If diarrhea, vomiting or fever persist longer than 24 hours, consult your doctor or pediatric nurse. An electrolyte maintenance solution won't stop diarrhea or vomiting, but it does prevent dehydration.

4 Infant Supplements to Ask Your Pediatrician About

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Starting your baby on solid foods is exciting  and messy! Most babies start with a very small amount of solids at around 4 to 6 months old, slowly increasing their portion size. Then, at around 9 to 11 months old, you may start noticing a dramatic drop in how much breast milk or formula your baby drinks as he or she starts getting more nutrition and calories from solid foods.   Because of their changing dietary needs over this transition, it is important that infants get the nutrition they need to grow and develop.  For some children, this means filling nutritional gaps with carefully chosen supplements.     Iron   Babies are born with a store of iron that lasts them for about 4 to 6 months. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that full-term infants who are exclusively breast-fed be given an iron supplement starting at 4 months of age. Talk to your pediatrician to see if your infant needs an iron supplement. Children born premature or with a low birth weight may have reduced iron stores. If so, your pediatrician will probably recommend iron supplements until your baby's first birthday. Formula is generally iron-fortified, which means formula-fed babies rarely need an iron supplement.   As infants begin to eat more solid food, serving them iron-rich foods such as iron-fortified cereal, meat or beans at least twice a day will help them meet their iron needs. But, if your baby is over 6 months old, is breast-fed and is not eating iron-rich foods, your pediatrician may recommend an iron supplement.   To promote iron absorption from plant foods, combine iron-rich solid foods you serve to your child with vitamin C-rich foods in one meal. For example, pair a bean and rice puree or finger food meal with tomato sauce, fruit or a fruit puree.   Vitamin D   Vitamin D is important for healthy bones and prevention of chronic disease. Because low levels of vitamin D are so common, the American Academy of Pediatrics says all breast-fed infants  and formula-fed infants who drink less than 32 ounces of formula per day  should take a supplement. When starting solids, you can mix vitamin D drops in purees as well as add them to formula or water.   Fluoride   Before you determine if your baby needs fluoride, which is important for cavity prevention, you need to know levels of fluoride in your local water supply. Fluoride supplements are only available by prescription, so discuss this with your pediatrician.   Vitamin B 12   Vitamin B 12 , which prevents anemia and supports healthy neurological function, is found in animal products such as meat, fish, eggs and dairy, and is not a concern for most children. However, if you plan to introduce only plant-based foods into your child's diet, he or she may need a B 12  supplement. Formula-fed vegan babies can get their vitamin B 12  from a special fortified formula, most often soy-based. Vegan mothers who exclusively breast-feed should be sure to consume adequate vitamin B 12  through fortified foods and supplements in order to provide ample B 12  to her baby via breast milk.Vitamin B 12  is typically included in most over-the-counter infant vitamin drops and many ready-to-eat cereals and milk substitutes.   Before giving your infant any supplements, always consult with your pediatrician. Not all infants automatically need supplements when starting solids. Make sure to introduce your baby to a variety of foods in order to develop his or her palate and meet nutritional needs.

For pregnant women, key habits include eating a variety of foods, ensuring adequate intake of vitamins and minerals, gaining an appropriate amount of weight, participating in regular physical activity and avoiding harmful substances.   Once the baby has arrived, it is important that newborns receive optimal nutrition from the beginning. Studies have shown that breast-feeding provides many advantages to both baby and mother  in terms of health benefits and financial savings. In addition to eating right from birth, developing physical activity habits at an early ageis also important. Active young children are better prepared for life than those who spend childhood sedentary in front of a television or video game screen.   Eating Right during Pregnancy   Moms-to-be need a variety of foods from all the  MyPlate  food groups to get the nutrition needed for a healthy pregnancy. Pregnant women need a balanced diet including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, low-fat dairy and healthful fats. A prenatal multivitamin/mineral supplement may be recommended by your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist to ensure that you get enough iron, folic acid and other nutrients. Safe food practices are important, too, since pregnant women are at higher risk of food poisoning.   Healthy Weight Gain during Pregnancy   While pregnancy is not the time to lose weight, women should not use their expanding bellies as an excuse to eat more than is necessary. The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite.   Many women start off pregnancy overweight or obese; many gain more weight than is healthy during their pregnancy. Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy is risky for both mother and child.   Breast-feeding Benefits   For optimal nutrition for your infant, the Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticsrecommends exclusively breast-feeding for the first six months to provide optimal nutrition and health protection, and continuing breast-feeding with the addition of complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12 months of age.   In addition to providing the best nutrition, breast-feeding reduces your baby's risk of ear infections, respiratory illnesses, gastrointestinal infections and possibly sudden infant death syndrome and obesity. Breast-feeding also provides mom with benefits including aiding in weight loss after delivery and reducing risk of breast and ovarian cancers.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Young kids with healthy teeth have more than just beautiful smiles. Baby teeth help children speak and chew, while holding a place in the jaw for the permanent teeth that are still hiding under the gums. But, ""poor oral health [at any age] can impact general health,"" says Lisa Harper Mallonee, MPH, RD, LD, registered dietitian, registered dental hygienist and associate professor at Texas A&M Baylor College of Dentistry.    It's never too soon to start caring for your children's teeth. Before the first tooth even erupts, Malloonee says, ""You really should start swabbing the mouth after feedings with a soft cloth."" Beginning a few days after birth, wipe the gums with a soft baby washcloth to remove plaque that can cause decay in erupting teeth. Dental caries, or tooth decay, are little holes in the teeth caused by bacteria in the mouth, which thrive on the sugars in our diet and produce acids that attack the tooth. Dental caries are on the rise among children, especially between the ages of 2 and 11 years old. Fortunately, good oral hygiene and a healthy diet can prevent tooth and gum problems throughout life.   The Bad   ""Avoid putting babies to bed with a bottle,"" says Angela Lemond, RDN, CSP, LD, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""It's common for babies and toddlers to fall asleep while drinking."" When this happens, breast milk or formula sits on teeth and gums for long periods, providing an environment that tooth-decay-causing bacteria love.   As children get older and start eating a greater variety of foods, it's important to pay attention to their consumption of sweets and sticky foods, Lemond says. Frequently eating the following foods increases the risk of developing dental caries:     Sugar-sweetened beverages such as sodas, fruit drinks, sports and energy drinks, and sweetened teas and coffee, especially if sipped over a long period of time   Sticky foods like caramels, raisins and dried apricots, particularly when eaten alone   Lollipops and other hard candies that dissolve slowly   Desserts like cookies, cakes and brownies   Sugar, including brown sugar, honey, molasses and agave nectar     Grazing or snacking frequently throughout the day also increases the risk of caries. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics suggests that you allow at least two hours between snacks and meals.    The Good   Eating fresh fruits and vegetables helps protect teeth by stimulating the production of saliva, which cleanses the mouth and and makes it less acidic. Chewing sugar-free gum for 20 minutes after meals and snacks also can help prevent tooth decay.   Drinking water with food  and after a meal  helps eliminate bacteria and reduce acid production. And, if your water is fluoridated, you and your family are getting extra protection. ""Fluoride is a mineral that helps resist tooth decay by decreasing acid levels in the mouth and even aiding in the repair process of early decay,"" Lemond says.   Approximately three-quarters of Americans receive fluoridated water through their community water system, but some bottled waters dont contain fluoride, she says. If youre not consuming water with fluoride, talk to your dentist about other ways to get it, including topical fluoride treatments at your dentists office.   A good diet is critical for the health of the mouth and staying healthy, but it wont make up for poor dental hygiene. Continue to see your dentist for checkups and cleanings, and make sure to brush and floss regularly.         Jill Weisenberger, MS, RDN, CDE, FAND, is a nutrition writer based in Virginia.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.      Reviewed by Eleese Cunningham, RDN     Does eating seafood while pregnant seem  fishy ? You're not alone in thinking so. Pregnant women are bombarded with lists of things they can't eat, and misinformation about seafood abounds. But the truth is that pregnant women can and should eat fish (with a few exceptions).   Why Eat Fish?   It's true that not all fish is safe for pregnant women, but avoiding seafood can be detrimental too. Pregnant women should aim to eat eight to no more than 12 ounces of safe seafood a week. And, here's why.   Fish is full of protein and iron.  Pregnant women need at least 27 milligrams of iron a day (up from 18 milligrams pre-pregnancy) to help prevent anemia, and 71 grams of protein daily (up from 46 grams) to support the baby's growth and a woman's own physical changes. ""Soon-to-be mothers need to make sure they're getting adequate amounts of protein during pregnancy,"" says Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Spokesperson Jessica Crandall, RDN, CDE, AFAA. ""Fish is encouraged because it's a great source of both protein and iron.""   You and your baby need omega-3 fatty acids.  Oily fish like wild salmon and sardines are high in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a type of omega-3 fatty acid. ""Omega-3 fatty acids are helpful with decreasing inflammation and also help with infant brain development,"" says Crandall. ""Eating omega-3-rich proteins like fish is very healthy for pregnant women.""   Food aversions may narrow your diet.  Expectant mothers should eat a wide variety of healthy foods, but pregnancy may limit your food tolerances. Fish is a nutrient-rich food, and expectant mothers should add it to their diets if it appeals to them.    Because omega-3 fatty acids are so important for your baby's development, Crandall recommends talking to your doctor to see if you should take a fish or flaxseed oil supplement if you cannot tolerate fish. ""I always choose food as the first line of action, but a supplement can be helpful for those women not eating an adequate amount of omega-3.""   What Fish Is Safe?   Avoid seafood high in methyl mercury and other environmental toxins when pregnant. ""Methyl mercury can damage brain, kidney and central nervous system development of the fetus,"" says Crandall. ""It is a toxic chemical and it builds up most commonly in predatory species of fish. The chemical passes through the placenta and may harm the fetus.""   Mercury is both naturally occurring in our environment and also results from industrial pollution. When it falls from the air and accumulates in water, it becomes methyl mercury. Some fish accumulate more methyl mercury than others, depending on their diet, habitat, size and longevity. Here's what seafood to eat, and what to avoid.   Seafood to Eat and to Avoid   Eat: Eight to 12 ounces per week     Tilapia   Cod   Salmon   Crab   Shrimp   Sardines   Canned light tuna   Pollock   Catfish     Eat: Up to 6 ounces per week     Albacore or ""white"" tuna     Avoid     Shark   Swordfish   King Mackerel   Tilefish   Raw fish (including sushi, sashimi, ceviche and carpaccio) due to food poisoning risk   Refrigerated smoked seafood due to listeria risk     Cook Quality Fish   Check local advisories for food safety alerts before eating locally caught fish. When in doubt, limit your consumption of local seafood to 6 ounces a week.   Quality fish has these characteristics:     Bright, clear eyes   Intact scales   A fresh or mild salt water scent   Firm to the touch with flesh that springs back when pressed   Cold (below 40F) with no ice crystals     Refrigerate fish quickly after purchase, consume it within a day or two of purchase, and cook it to an internal temperature of about 145F to  reduce your risk of food poisoning . Enjoy fish and the nutritional boost it provides you and your growing baby.         Reviewed June 2014       Tags     Health   Pregnancy   What to Eat When Expecting   For Women"

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Breast-feeding requires extra nutrition, making healthy eating just as important post-pregnancy. Women who are breast-feeding use about 500 calories daily to make the full amount of milk most babies need from birth to 6 months. Two-thirds of those calories should come from meals and snacks containing foods from all five food groups. The remaining calories come from the weight gained during pregnancy. While many women find breast-feeding helps them lose weight, weight loss varies among mothers depending on physical activity, the amount of weight gained during pregnancy and how much breast milk is produced.   A slow, gradual weight loss of 1 pound per week or 4 pounds per month is a safe goal for breast-feeding moms who want to return to their pre-pregnancy weight. Women who eat less than 1,800 calories per day may reduce the amount of milk their bodies make. Stress, anxiety and fatigue can also decrease milk production. Do yourself and your baby a favor  relax and sit down to eat three meals per day. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and choose healthy snacks between meals. Moderate physical activity, such as walking, is also good for you and will not reduce milk volume.   Choosing the Right Foods   Eating right while breast-feeding is not complicated and it does not need to be bland. Mothers from many cultures breast-feed successfully on a diet of widely varied foods. Follow these guidelines to reach a healthy weight while keeping your baby well-nourished.     Eat a variety of foods from all five food groups. Visit  ChooseMyPlate.gov  to get a personalized eating plan for breast-feeding women.   For protein, choose lean meat, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, nuts and seeds. Eat no more than 12 ounces per week of fish and shellfish and no more than 6 ounces per week of albacore tuna. Avoid fish with high mercury levels, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish.   Eat colorful fruits and vegetables. Fill half your plate with vegetables and fruit at lunch and dinner, and include fruit and vegetables in snacks. Whole fruit is better than juice, so limit juice to 1 cup per day and make sure its 100-percent juice.   Include three servings of low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt or cheese each day. If you dont think you can tolerate milk, try lactose-free milk or calcium-fortified soy milk.   Choose whole-wheat bread, brown rice and whole-wheat pasta more often than refined grains.   Use healthful oils, such as olive oil, canola, soybean and corn oil, but in small amounts since they can amount to extra calories.   Drink enough water and decaffeinated unsweetened beverages to quench your thirst. While you are breast-feeding, your need for fluids increases. Limit caffeine-containing beverages  including coffee, tea and soft drinks  to one or two 8-ounce cups a day.   Make smart food choices that are low in empty calories. Empty calories are found in foods high in added sugars and fats including soft drinks, desserts, fried foods and fatty meats.   Vitamin and mineral supplements cannot replace a healthy diet. Talk with your doctor before taking any vitamin or mineral supplements.   If you have special nutrition needs, consult a  registered dietitian nutritionist  for a customized eating plan.

Does being pregnant mean saying goodbye to softball, tennis or any other sport you enjoy? Not necessarily.   Being physically active during pregnancy offers women many health benefits, among them a psychological lift, optimal weight gain and better aerobic fitness. For most pregnancies, mild to moderate physical activity benefits mom and won't affect your unborn child. Consider these benefits to staying active during pregnancy. You can:     Look and feel good as your body changes.   Promote muscle tone, stamina and strength.   Reduce leg and back pain, constipation, swelling and bloating.   Promote blood circulation and possibly help prevent varicose veins.   Help your posture and balance, which is very important as your center of gravity shifts.   Sleep better.   Prepare your body for labor and childbirth.   Get your body back in shape after delivery.     From  2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans : Pregnant and Postpartum Women   Healthy women who are not already doing vigorous-intensity physical activity should get at least 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Preferably, this activity should be spread throughout the week. Women who regularly engage in vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or high amounts of activity can continue their activity provided that their condition remains unchanged and they talk to their health care provider about their activity level throughout their pregnancy.   All the nutritional issues that relate to a healthy pregnancy apply to female athletes. Eat a varied and balanced diet with enough calories to support your baby and your own needs while meeting the physical demands of your activity.   Fluid replacement has even more health implications during pregnancy as your own and your baby's blood volume increases. If you don't drink enough fluids, you're at greater risk for dehydration and overheating; early in pregnancy, that can affect the development of your unborn baby. Stay hydrated throughout the day with water plus fat-free or low-fat milk and moderate servings of 100 percentjuice.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    You may pump iron at the gym a few times a week, but your body pumps it continuously through the bloodstream every day. Iron is needed to make hemoglobin, a part of red blood cells that acts like a taxicab for oxygen and carbon dioxide. It picks up oxygen in the lungs, drives it through the bloodstream and drops it off in tissues including the skin and muscles. Then, it picks up carbon dioxide and drives it back to the lungs where it's exhaled.   Iron Deficiency   If the body doesn't absorb its needed amount of iron, it becomes iron deficient. Symptoms appear only when iron deficiency has progressed to iron deficiency anemia, a condition in which the body's iron stores are so low that not enough normal red blood cells can be made to carry oxygen efficiently.  Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency and the leading cause of anemia in the United States.       Symptoms include:     Fatigue   Pale skin and fingernails   Weakness   Dizziness   Headache   Glossitis (inflamed tongue)     Sources of Iron   The body absorbs two to three times more iron from animal sources than from plants. Some of the best dietary sources of iron are:     Lean beef    Turkey   Chicken   Lean pork   Fish     Although you absorb less of the iron in plants, every bite counts, and adding a source of vitamin C to vegetarian sources of iron will enhance absorption. Some of the best plant sources of iron are:     Beans, including pinto, kidney, soybeans and lentils   Dark green leafy vegetables such as spinach   Fortified breakfast cereals   Enriched rice   Whole-grain and enriched breads     High-Risk Populations   The following populations are at a higher risk for developing iron deficiency.   Women Who Are Pregnant or Breast-feeding:  Increased blood volume requires more iron to drive oxygen to the baby and growing reproductive organs. Consult your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist before taking an iron supplement.   Young Children:  Babies store enough iron for the first six months of life. After six months, their iron needs increase. Breast milk and iron-fortified infant formula can supply the amount of iron not met by solids. Cow's milk is a poor source of iron. When children drink too much milk, they crowd out other foods and may develop ""milk anemia."" Two cups of milk per day is the recommended amount for toddlers.    Adolescent Girls:  Their often inconsistent or restricted diets  combined with rapid growth  put adolescent girls at risk.   Women of Childbearing Age:  Women with excessively heavy menstrual periods may develop iron deficiency.   How to Prevent Iron Deficiency   Eat a balanced, healthy diet that includes good sources of iron to prevent any deficiencies. Combine vegetarian sources of iron with vitamin C in the same meal. For example: a bell pepper-bean salad, spinach with lemon juice, or fortified cereal and berries.   If treatment for iron deficiency is needed, a health-care provider will assess iron status and determine the exact form of treatment  which may include changes in diet or taking supplements.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    In spite of all your efforts to stay healthy, your child has caught the bug a mild cold, but nonetheless a nagging one. Did you know children, on average, get between eight to 10 colds per year? That is generally until kindergarten when theyve built up their immunity.    Sure they should get plenty of rest and sufficient fluids. (A child around 18 lbs. should get approximately 27 oz., and around 30 lbs., 39 oz.) But what are your best bets for feeding them when they are mildly sick with a little sneezing, a cough and a runny nose?   Diluted fruit juices, water, soup and broth are great ways of replenishing fluids. If your child has a fever, vomiting or diarrhea, follow your pediatrician's recommendations for replacing fluids. Older kids with a cold may benefit from decaffeinated teas with honey and lemon.   Give Them Some Fruit   There may be no solid evidence to suggest vitamin C will cure a cold, but its antioxidant properties can't hurt. Good sources of vitamin C include: lemons, oranges, grapefruit and even strawberries.   Offer your child a variety of soft fruits; they are not only full of vitamins and minerals to support good health and immunity, but contain a good deal of water to help support your child's fluid needs. Frozen sliced fruits are convenient and easy to thaw, and they won't spoil as quickly as fresh fruit. Here are a couple of ways to serve them:     Slightly thawed fruits, such as blueberries or strawberries, offer a cooling sensation on the throat. Another option is to make or purchase frozen fruit bars (look for those with little or no added sugar.)   Blend frozen fruit chunks into a smoothie using low-fat or fat-free milk or a soy beverage if your child has a milk allergy.     Delight Them with Their Favorites   But don't overdo it. A sick child may have a poor appetite so serve up mini meals based on their favorite type of foods. Frequent small meals are easier to digest and will help meet their energy needs. Steer clear of rich, fried, greasy foods and lean toward simple starches such as rice and noodles as these are easy on the stomach. Try bananas, rice, applesauce or toast if they are a bit queasy. If you can get in some vegetables, great, but focus more on getting them nourished!   Try Chicken Soup   Try making your own from last night's roasted chicken or buy low sodium stock. Soup is warm, soothing and an accepted remedy. It will also help provide for your child's fluid needs. For a more filling soup, add some rice or noodles and cooked, chopped vegetables. A couple tablespoons of oat flour can also be used to thicken soups while heating.               Tags     Health   Wellness   Preventing Illness   For Kids   For Parents"

You want your children to eat healthfully, but what's good for you may not be good for your kids. In particular, adults and very young children need different amounts of fat in their diets. Fat is an important source of calories that support infants' and toddlers' growth. Two fatty acids  linoleic and alpha-linolenic acid  are essential for your child's growth and brain development. Our bodies don't make these acids, so we must get them from food. Kids also need some fat from food to help their bodies use vitamins A, D, E and K. So don't cut back on fat for young children.   Starting at age 2, children's and teens' diets like adults' should be moderate in total fat and low in saturated fat and  trans  fat. From this point forward, whole grains, fruits, vegetables, low-fat dairy and other protein-rich foods should supply most of your children's calories.

Help your family eat right by filling half their plates with fruits and vegetables. One way to do it is by adding layers of flavor. Here are some ideas on how to make meals nutritious and delicious.   Be Saucy with Fruit   Puree berries, apples, peaches or pears for a thick, sweet sauce on grilled or broiled seafood or poultry, pancakes, French toast or waffles.   Bake with Fruits and Vegetables   Use pureed fruit such as applesauce, dried plums (prunes), bananas or peaches in place of about half the fat in recipes for homemade breads, muffins, pancakes and other baked goods. For flavor, texture and nutrients, blend in shredded zucchini, carrots or dried fruits.   ""Sandwich"" in Fruits and Vegetables   Add pizzazz to sandwiches by layering on sliced pineapple, apple, raisins, peppers, cucumbers, sprouts or tomatoes.   Combine with Veggies or Fruit   Make a quick stir-fry or combine pasta or rice with just about any vegetables, or add them to soup  great ways to use fresh vegetables before they spoil. Add apricots, pineapple, other fruit or fruit chutney to meat or poultry dishes.  Hint:  Add canned, frozen or cooked legumes.   Experiment   Substitute a new-to-you fruit or vegetable in a favorite recipe. Try broccoli rabe (broccoli variety with smaller heads, also called rapini) in stir-fries, fennel in salad, or yautia (a starchy vegetable) in stew.   Take Fruit to Lunch   Make a habit of tucking an apple, tangerine, two plums or kiwifruit, grapes, cherries or dried fruits into your briefcase, tote or lunch bag. Fruit is a great traveling snack.   Stuff an Omelet with Veggies   For a hearty meal, fill it with crisp, tasty vegetables such as broccoli, squash, carrots, peppers, tomatoes, spinach or onions.   Toss a Vegetable Salad   Add colorful vegetables, legumes and fruits (such as berries, kiwifruit or mandarin oranges). Even if you prefer iceberg lettuce, which delivers less nutrients than other greens, pair it with other veggies  sliced beets, shredded red cabbage, spinach leaves, baby carrots.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    There's a reason you hear so much about eating dark leafy greens. Vegetables such as kale, chard, collard greens and spinach are bursting with nutrition. But many parents find their kids are reluctant to eat them.    Discover how to prepare these nutritional superstars in ways that are healthy and appetizing.     The Nutritional Benefits of Greens   The USDA's MyPlate specifically recommends adults and children over 9 eat one and a half to two cups of dark green vegetables per week. Nutrient-dense dark leafy greens are high in several vitamins and minerals, but at just 10 to 25 calories per half-cup serving, are low in calories. ""The family of dark green leafy vegetables deliver vitamin A, vitamin C, antioxidants, fiber, folate, vitamin K, magnesium, calcium, iron and potassium,"" says Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Spokesperson Isabel Maples, MEd, RDN. ""So they really make the most of every calorie.""   These nutrients perform a variety of functions in the body, including promoting good vision, supporting immune function, acting as an antioxidant that may help prevent some types of cancer, and regulating blood pressure.   I Bought Leafy Greens  Now What?   Fresh greens can be stored in the crisper drawer of the refrigerator for three to five days. While some bagged greens from the grocery store are already washed, not every variety for sale has been cleaned. ""Those from a farmers market may have dirt and sand in the leaves,"" says Academy Spokesperson Sarah Krieger, MPH, RDN, LDN. To clean your greens, Krieger recommends submerging the leaves in a large bowl of cold water and swirling the leaves to allow the dirt to sink to the bottom of the bowl. Then, lift the leaves from the bowl and pat dry with a clean kitchen towel.   Or, if you have one, Academy Spokesperson Kristen Gradney, RDN, LDN, recommends using a salad spinner to quickly clean and dry greens. Gradney also suggests cleaning and blanching large batches of greens, and storing the blanched greens in the freezer for future use. For quicker cooking, Gradney recommends removing the tough stems by folding a stack of leaves in half lengthwise and running a sharp knife along the stem.   4 Tips for Kid-Friendly Leafy Greens   ""People often get intimidated by cooking and eating darker varieties of greens due to their intense flavors,"" says Academy Spokesperson Angela Lemond, RDN, CSP, LD. Try these tips for enhancing the flavor of different varieties to make them more enticing:     Academy Spokesperson Sara Haas, RDN, LDN, says you can overcome the bitterness of collard and mustard greens by braising them ""low and slow"" (at a low temperature for an extended period of time), and adding a pinch of sugar at the end of cooking. Haas also says to remove the tough stems to reduce cooking time and avoid over-cooked greens.   For kale, be sure to choose the right variety. Tougher curly kale is best for adding to soups or stews or for braising, says Haas. Tender lacinato and baby kale are best in salads.   Preserve nutrients by sauting greens, rather than boiling. Krieger recommends sauting blanched greens with olive oil, onion and garlic to add flavor. Lemond recommends adding chopped nuts for additional heart-healthy fats. Haas says you can sprinkle lemon zest over the sauted greens to brighten the flavor, but she warns not to use lemon juice, which will turn the leaves brown.   Make a salad with tender greens such as spinach or baby kale. To expose kids to dark greens, Lemond recommends tossing together a salad made half with familiar lettuce and half with a dark green. Add a citrus-based dressing, which will help balance the strong flavor of the greens and aid in the absorption of iron found in the greens.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Even if you're struggling to pay your bills, there are resources available to help you and your family eat nutritious meals. ""Poor nutrition can impair health and immunity, lower productivity, and hinder development and learning,"" says Alison Kaufman, MS, RD, LDN, Director of Hunger and Nutrition at the Jewish Family & Children's Service of Greater Boston.   If you're finding it difficult to put healthy food on the table, these resources can help.     Get to know SNAP.  Formerly known as Food Stamps, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) can provide additional monthly assistance to buy foods such as fruit, vegetables, bread, cereal, meat, fish, poultry and milk. SNAP dollars aren't limited to your local grocery store. Monthly benefits, provided in the form of a debit card, can also be used at convenience and specialty stores.   Visit your local farmers market.  If your neighborhood doesn't have a local supermarket, you may think it's impossible to find fresh fruits and vegetables. Farmers markets are  sprouting up in many underserved neighborhoods . These markets provide fresh, locally grown produce that you can often purchase with SNAP dollars. And there's another perk: ""Many states will give double dollars for SNAP participants who use farmers markets. So $10 in SNAP benefits will get you $20 in produce,"" says Mary Flynn, PhD, RD, LDN, an associate professor of medicine at Brown University.   If you have children under age 5, check out WIC.  WIC, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, provides supplemental foods, health care referrals, nutrition education and breast-feeding promotion and support to low-income pregnant, breast-feeding and postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age 5 who are at risk for poor nutrition.  If you're eligible , you'll receive foods to meet your unique nutrition requirements as well as those of your young children. WIC foods include iron-fortified cereal, whole-wheat bread, eggs, milk, cheese, beans, peanut butter, canned fish, fruits and vegetables and vitamin C-rich fruit juice. WIC can also provide foods for your baby including baby food and iron-fortified infant cereal and iron-fortified infant formula.   Take advantage of school meals.  Depending on your family's income level, your child may qualify for free or reduced cost breakfast and lunch at school through the National School Breakfast and National School Lunch Programs. Thanks to the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, school meals are healthier than ever, serving up more lean meat, low-fat dairy, whole grains and fruits and vegetables. And good nutrition doesnt necessarily take a break when school lets out. The Afterschool Meal Program may provide snacks or dinner to children in eligible school programs. ""For children with parents that work shifts during the evening meal, dinner programs provide many children with the only food they will have access to after school,"" says Flynn. Even when school isnt in session, the Summer Food Service Program provides nutritious meals to fill the void.     The following websites provide additional information about these programs.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    While pregnancy is not the time to lose weight, women should not use their expanding bellies as a reason to eat more than is necessary. The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including her body mass index, or BMI, before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite. All pregnant women should eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods each day. It may also be necessary to take a vitamin and mineral supplement if recommended by a physician.   Many women start off pregnancy with an overweight or obese BMI and many gain more weight than is healthy during their pregnancy. Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy is risky for both mother and child, with some risks including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension (high blood pressure), Cesarean delivery, birth defects and even fetal death. If a women is obese during pregnancy, it also raises the chance her child will be obese later in life.   Weight Gain Guidelines   The latest weight gain guidelines by the Institute of Medicine are based on a women's BMI before pregnancy. ( See Understanding Body Mass Index (BMI) .) The amount of weight gained depends on which category the pre-pregnancy BMI lands in:     Underweight:  BMI below 18.5   Normal weight:  18.5 to 24.9   Overweight:  25.0 to 29.9   Obese:  30.0 and above     The weight ranges below are for a full-term pregnancy:     Underweight:  28 to 40 pounds   Normal:  25 to 35 pounds   Overweight:  15 to 25 pounds   Obese:  11 to 20 pounds     For twins, the recommendations naturally go up:     Normal:  37 to 54 pounds   Overweight:  31 to 50 pounds   Obese:  25 to 42 pounds     There are no set guidelines for underweight BMI weight gain with twins.   Calorie Intake   In general, pregnant women need between 2,200 calories and 2,900 calories a day. A gradual increase in calories as the baby grows is the best bet. Here is an overview of how calorie needs change during each trimester:     The first trimester does not require any extra calories.   During the second trimester, an additional 340 calories a day are recommended.   For the third trimester, the recommendation is 450 calories more a day than when not pregnant.     Additional calories should come from nutrient-dense foods including lean protein, whole grains, dairy, vegetables and fruit. Avoid unneeded extra calories by cutting down on foods high in fat and added sugars such as regular soda, sweets and fried foods.   Physical Activity   Physical activity can help manage weight gain. The activity guidelines for pregnant women are 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days of the week. Make sure to talk with a doctor before starting or continuing any exercise routine while pregnant.         Reviewed January 2017         Tags     Health   Pregnancy   Prenatal Wellness   For Women"

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    If you have teenage children, you've heard it before: ""There's nothing to eat in this house!"" Sure, you can do your part by buying lots of healthy foods. But your teen can get involved too, by helping to prepare some of those foods. Why? ""When teens learn cooking skills at home, they'll be less likely to eat unhealthy fast food or unbalanced meals when they become responsible for their own food choices after they leave home,"" says Academy spokesperson Sonya Angelone, MS, RDN, CLT.   To help your teen get cooking, stock your kitchen with these easy-to-prepare staples.   Popcorn   What teen doesn't crave crunchy snacks? Skip the chips and pretzels and invest in a popcorn popper. Popcorn is a whole grain, plus it's loaded with fiber for a healthy digestive system. Three air-popped cups deliver nearly four grams of fiber.   Canned Beans   ""When it comes to making a quick meal, it doesn't get much easier than canned beans,"" says Angelone. ""Just rinse, drain and heat!"" They're perfect for burritos, mashed on a tortilla, or added to canned soup for extra protein.   Nut Butters   Even if teens have no clue how to cook, that doesn't mean they can't whip up a simple meal or snack. Nut and seed butters  such as peanut, almond or sunflower butter  all are perfect no-fuss foods for the novice cook. They're a cinch to spread on French toast with sliced bananas or make a tasty dip for apples, celery or bell pepper strips.   Eggs   Whether fried, scrambled or hard-boiled, eggs are an ideal food for teen cooks, says Lori Zanini, RDN, CDE, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""With a prep and cook time of less than five minutes, eggs are an easy addition to any meal. They are a great source of protein, vitamin D, vitamin B 12, choline, and phosphorus  all essential nutrients for teens.""   Prepped Vegetables   It doesn't matter whether they're fresh, frozen or canned, the more pre-prepped vegetables you have on hand, the more likely your teen will eat them. Think pre-cut baby carrots and grape tomatoes for snacks, frozen edamame and peas to add to pasta and diced tomatoes for chili.   Grains   Busy teens don't have a lot of time to spend in the kitchen, but that doesn't mean dinner has to be a sandwich. Quick-cooking whole grains such as quinoa, instant brown rice and whole-wheat couscous take less than 15 minutes from start to finish. For a speedy meal, teens can toss cooked whole grains with microwaved frozen vegetables and season them with reduced-sodium soy sauce.   Lean Protein   When you teach teens basic cooking techniques you'll be amazed by how quickly they catch on. Start by showing them how to grill, bake or broil marinated chicken, fish or beef. Or, demonstrate how to saut ground chicken or turkey to add to spaghetti sauce, chili or tacos.   Before you know it, your teen will be telling  you  what's for dinner.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Phenylketonuria, or PKU, is a genetically inherited birth defect that causes an unwanted buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood. This buildup occurs because the enzyme that routinely converts one amino acid, phenylalanine, to another amino acid, tyrosine, is absent or deficient. Phenylalanine then accumulates in the blood and is toxic to brain tissue.    PKU at Birth   Babies born in the United States are screened for PKU with a blood test so treatment can begin immediately and prevent the adverse side effects of the condition, such as declining intelligence, neurological deterioration, stunted growth, hyperactivity and seizures. A treatment team typically consists of a metabolic dietitian, physician, geneticist and psychologist as an infant is monitored during different phases of growth and development in childhood to an adult.   A strict diet limited in phenylalanine is the main treatment for PKU. Phenylalanine is found in most protein-containing foods such as milk, eggs, cheese, nuts, soybeans, chicken, beef, pork, beans and fish. ""An infant will have to consume a special phenylalanine-free formula for the first year of life,"" says Sarah Krieger, MPH, RDN, LDN, former pokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. However, some breast milk can be used in limited amounts.   Creating an Unique Meal Plan   As the infant grows and becomes developmentally ready for solid foods, a registered dietitian nutritionist with expertise in PKU will create a unique menu for the child. ""The metabolic dietitian can create meal plans with modified food sources of protein low in phenylalanine and high in tyrosine, while providing adequate calories, vitamins and minerals to support growth,"" says Krieger. Because so many foods are off limits with PKU, the meal plans include special formulas which are often the primary source of calories and essential nutrients. Special phenylalanine-free foods are available for children and teens with PKU. The metabolic dietitian will create individual eating plans and modify them as needed to promote healthy growth and development.    The diet needs to be followed for life. ""The individual with PKU will require blood monitoring to maintain serum phenylalanine levels,"" says Kreiger. In conjunction with blood monitoring, the metabolic dietitian will regularly review diet records or food journals and growth charts, making adjustments to the eating plan as needed.    Parents of children with PKU need to be creative with foods and use available PKU cookbooks. Get help with menu planning from the metabolic dietitian and plan ahead for eating out, school lunches, potlucks, trips and vacations, and other special events. Try to center special occasions around activities rather than food, and encourage your child to be part of the management of his or her diet as early as possible. ""A skilled dietitian, physician and psychologist team can address social issues with each stage of life,"" says Kreiger.

Food Tips for Summer Travel with Kids

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Long-anticipated summer travel is not without its nutritional challenges, and adding young children to the mix multiplies those challenges. There's more to consider than packing a few extra snacks and baby wipes. Follow these  tips for a healthy, happy and nourishing summer vacation with kids.     Road Trip   Logging long miles in the car may have your kids asking for snacks to ease the boredom. Anticipate this, and be prepared. Wesley Delbridge, RD, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, suggests collaborating with your kids on a list of boredom-busting activities including games, music, videos, coloring books and more. Before turning the ignition key, review the day's schedule. Explain when and where you'll eat. Make a strong effort to stick to your normal eating schedule, says Delbridge.    Pack some of these travel-friendly foods. Keep perishable items in a cooler with ice, so no one gets sick. If your child is at risk for choking, enjoy your food at a rest stop.     Low-fat yogurt   Cheese sticks   Cottage cheese   Sliced bell peppers, cucumbers or other easy-to-eat veggies   Applesauce   Dried and fresh fruit   Popcorn   Trail mix   Peanut butter sandwiches   Whole-grain crackers   Low-fat milk boxes   100-percent fruit or vegetable juice   Water     Don't forget portable silverware and plenty of paper towels and wipes.   Enjoying a combination of restaurant meals and packed food saves money while providing good nutrition, says Sarah Krieger, MPH, RDN, spokesperson for the Academy. Be clear about the rules before entering the restaurant, she says. Water and milk are good beverage choices, and even restaurant meals should include fruits and vegetables. If the restaurant doesn't offer good options, fill in with the supply in your cooler.   A Stay at the Beach   Whether you're hitting the beach for a day or staying for a week, the same guidelines apply. Try to stick as closely to your normal eating schedule as possible. Bring a cooler with some of the foods listed above and plenty of ice. Pack ample water and encourage frequent sipping. The hot sun can be dehydrating, and the cool ocean water and tons of fun can distract kids from drinking fluids.   Cruising Along   Food is present constantly and in big, showy ways. Delbridge suggests reminding children that just because food is there, doesn't mean the family needs to eat it. Above all, he advises, be a role model to your kids and avoid overindulging.   Travel Abroad   Before traveling, research local foods and customs to get your kids excited about trying new foods, suggests Krieger. Show pictures of different foods and of children eating in foreign countries. Be prepared for the long plane ride, too. Pack some of the non-perishable foods above and an empty water bottle to fill after making it through security.   Visiting Family or Friends   Whether you're traveling with others or staying in their homes, you may run into well-meaning food pushers. Give relatives and friends a kind heads-up to your expectations when it comes to offering food to your children. Help them find other ways to express love and warmth such as reading a story or taking your child for a special outing.

Making the Grade at Lunchtime
",http://www.eatright.org/resource/food/nutrition/eat-right-at-school/making-the-grade-at-lunchtime,"Making the Grade at Lunchtime   Reviewed by Sharon Denny, MS, RDN       Published December 11, 2014           Print   Email                March is  National Nutrition Month , when the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reminds everyone to return to the basics of healthy eating. It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Breakfast is often called the most important meal of the day, but lunch also plays a critical role in children's overall health and school performance. When children skip lunch, they are likely to have trouble concentrating in the classroom, lack energy for sports and overeat on low-nutrient, after-school snacks.   Whether children eat lunch at home, enjoy a school-provided lunch or pack a lunch box, the goal is a nutrient-rich meal to fuel their brains and bodies for the afternoon. The trick is providing a lunch that packs a nutritional punch and appeals to your child. Try the following ideas to create lunches your child will eat rather than trade, throw away or bring back home.   Put Your Kids in the Chef's Seat   When kids help plan their lunches, they are more likely to eat them. If your child's school has a lunch program, review the menus together and pick the ones he or she enjoys. When kids eat school lunch, they are more likely to consume milk, meats, grains and vegetables, which gives them a higher nutrient intake over the course of an entire day. Cost- and nutrition-wise, school lunch is a great value.   If your child is more likely to eat a lunch packed at home, create a system that works for both of you. Agree on what goes into every lunch: some protein, a grain, at least one fruit and veggie, a dairy product (if not buying milk at school) and an optional small sweet or snack item. Make a checklist or spreadsheet of what your child likes in each category. For example: ""The vegetables I will eat in my lunch are: baby carrots, green pepper slices with ranch dip, cherry tomatoes or a mini-salad.""   Make a specific plan for the next week. Take time on the weekend to bag items for each day. Some families have baskets in the fridge and on the counter so everything (except sandwiches) can be prepared ahead of time.   Go for Gold Medal Food Choices   Variety is the basis of well-balanced nutrition. But don't worry if a child wants exactly the same lunch for two weeks in a row. He or she will probably change to something else before long. Work around normal pickiness by creating a list of alternatives. For example, if sandwiches are in the ""don't like"" column, what else might work?     Wraps (which now come in variety of colors and flavors)   Cracker sandwiches (usual ingredients on round or square crackers)   Little salads with protein (cheese, nuts, beans)   Bread-free sandwiches (such as a slice of lunch meat wrapped around a cheese stick)     Focus on Eye-Appeal   Kids, like adults, eat with their eyes first. They are attracted to foods by the packaging, so make sure your lunch can compete. Choose a reusable lunch bag or box with favorite cartoon characters or colors. Make foods as bright and colorful as possible. Have fun with shapes and size  use cookie cutters on sandwiches or make mini-muffins.

Lunch is in the Bag

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Between First Lady Michelle Obama's  Lets Move!  campaign against childhood obesity and Jamie Oliver's  Food Revolution,  there's no shortage of programs aimed at getting America's kids to eat healthier. These initiatives encourage parents to become more involved in their kids' meal choices and preschool is not too early to start your child on the path to eating right.   Packing a Healthy Lunch   A study in the July 2010 issue of the  Journal of the American Dietetic Association  (now  Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics )indicates that more than 57 percent of 3- to 6-year-old children in this country spend time each week in childcare centers. Although the majority of these centers prepare and serve lunch, many centers rely on parents to provide some or all of their childrens meals. If your child attends a center where you're required to provide them with a sack lunch from home, grab the opportunity to make it a healthy one!    What Can You Do?   Lots! Want to bump of the veggies in your child's lunch? ""Try mixing fruits and veggies together in one container, so a little sweet from the fruit rubs off on the veggies, such as sliced baby carrots mixed with a few raisins or dried cranberries,"" suggests Sarah Krieger, MPH, RDN, Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Spokesperson and a Fit4Allkids instructor. Make sure to cook the carrots, raisins and cranberries to avoid choking. Krieger recommends using variety to incorporate whole grains into your child's lunch (and life). In addition to whole grain bread, use mini whole grain pitas, English muffins and tortillas to make sandwiches. Whole grain cereals and whole grain crackers also make for healthy lunch options.   Set an Example!   Academy spokesperson Melinda Johnson, MS, RDN, says, ""Children won't eat healthier than their parents so, try to eat the way you want your children to eat."" Johnson recommends using a formula similar to what day care centers are required to utilize when creating a healthy lunch: one protein, one whole grain, one fruit, one vegetable and one milk. Once in a while, include a small treat such as a pudding cup or a slice of homemade quick bread such as banana, zucchini, or carrot.

What You Eat and Drink Matters   By Wendy Marcason, RDN       Published February 01, 2014           Print   Email                March is  National Nutrition Month , when the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reminds everyone to return to the basics of healthy eating. It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Human breast milk is the perfect nutrition source for an infant. It strikes a balance of carbohydrates, protein, fat, water and nutrients. It's easily digested and absorbed, and its composition naturally changes as a baby's developmental needs change.   And because mother's milk is a rich in antibodies, it builds a baby's immune system into a robust defense force. But does what a mother eats or drinks impact the milk she breast-feeds her child?    According to Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Spokesperson Jessica Crandall, RDN, CDE, nursing babies are unlikely to develop a food allergy from breast-feeding. ""But some foods may not agree with the infant,"" she says. ""Some common foods nursing mothers should avoid if the infant is fussy during feedings are: spicy foods or foods like cabbage and broccoli."" If this happens, avoid that particular food for a while.   Keep Hydrated   As a nursing mother, you should consume between 13 and 16 cups (104 to 128 ounces) of fluids a day  this includes fluids from food, by the way  to compensate for the extra water that is used up making milk. One way to ensure you're hydrated is to drink a large glass of water while breast-feeding your baby.   For the most part, a baby doesn't typically need anything but her mother's milk to stay hydrated. ""Under ordinary conditions, breast milk does supply adequate amounts of water,"" Crandall says.   If your infant appears dehydrated due to vomiting or diarrhea that lasts 24 hours or more, consult your pediatrician.   What about Caffeine?   A recent study published by the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that a mother who drinks small amounts of coffee is unlikely to affect either her unborn child or her nursing newborn's sleep patterns.   About 300 milligrams of caffeine a day  the amount found in approximately 24 ounces of coffee; seven shots of espresso; or seven 12-ounce cans of cola  is not considered enough to cause adverse effects for nursing mothers. Some women, however, find that their sensitivity to caffeine increases during pregnancy.   Alcohol during Nursing   If you breast-feed, it's best to abstain from alcohol. If your baby's breast-feeding behavior is well established, consistent, and predictable (no earlier than at 3 months of age), a mother may consume a single alcoholic drink if she then waits two hours or longer before breast-feeding.   If you do decide to have that glass of wine or beer, Crandall says there are some steps you can take to make sure it does not interfere with nursing. ""To ward off dehydration, be sure to down a glass of water in addition to the alcoholic drink,"" she says.   And because it can take a few hours for alcohol to fully clear from your body, preparation and timing of a nursing mother's drink is key. ""Eat beforehand, or when you're having your drink, as this will help lower the amount of alcohol in your blood and your milk,"" Crandall says. ""You can time your drink so that your baby won't be nursing for a few hours afterwards by having it right after a feeding, for example, or during one of your baby's longer stretches of sleep. Another option would be for you to bottle-feed your baby previously expressed breast milk.""   Is Fish OK?   While breast-feeding, reduce your exposure to known chemical contaminants such as mercury. Large bottom-dwelling fish are the most common food source of mercury. Avoid shark, swordfish, mackerel, and tilefish; eat up to 12 ounces of other kinds of fish every week with a maximum of 6 ounces albacore tuna per week; and check local advisories about eating locally caught fish. If no advice is posted, limit your intake of locally caught fish to 6 ounces per week and consume no other fish during that same week.

According to Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Spokesperson Jessica Crandall, RDN, CDE, nursing babies are unlikely to develop a food allergy from breast-feeding. ""But some foods may not agree with the infant,"" she says. ""Some common foods nursing mothers should avoid if the infant is fussy during feedings are: spicy foods or foods like cabbage and broccoli."" If this happens, avoid that particular food for a while.   Keep Hydrated   As a nursing mother, you should consume between 13 and 16 cups (104 to 128 ounces) of fluids a day  this includes fluids from food, by the way  to compensate for the extra water that is used up making milk. One way to ensure you're hydrated is to drink a large glass of water while breast-feeding your baby.   For the most part, a baby doesn't typically need anything but her mother's milk to stay hydrated. ""Under ordinary conditions, breast milk does supply adequate amounts of water,"" Crandall says.   If your infant appears dehydrated due to vomiting or diarrhea that lasts 24 hours or more, consult your pediatrician.   What about Caffeine?   A recent study published by the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that a mother who drinks small amounts of coffee is unlikely to affect either her unborn child or her nursing newborn's sleep patterns.   About 300 milligrams of caffeine a day  the amount found in approximately 24 ounces of coffee; seven shots of espresso; or seven 12-ounce cans of cola  is not considered enough to cause adverse effects for nursing mothers. Some women, however, find that their sensitivity to caffeine increases during pregnancy.   Alcohol during Nursing   If you breast-feed, it's best to abstain from alcohol. If your baby's breast-feeding behavior is well established, consistent, and predictable (no earlier than at 3 months of age), a mother may consume a single alcoholic drink if she then waits two hours or longer before breast-feeding.   If you do decide to have that glass of wine or beer, Crandall says there are some steps you can take to make sure it does not interfere with nursing. ""To ward off dehydration, be sure to down a glass of water in addition to the alcoholic drink,"" she says.   And because it can take a few hours for alcohol to fully clear from your body, preparation and timing of a nursing mother's drink is key. ""Eat beforehand, or when you're having your drink, as this will help lower the amount of alcohol in your blood and your milk,"" Crandall says. ""You can time your drink so that your baby won't be nursing for a few hours afterwards by having it right after a feeding, for example, or during one of your baby's longer stretches of sleep. Another option would be for you to bottle-feed your baby previously expressed breast milk.""   Is Fish OK?   While breast-feeding, reduce your exposure to known chemical contaminants such as mercury. Large bottom-dwelling fish are the most common food source of mercury. Avoid shark, swordfish, mackerel, and tilefish; eat up to 12 ounces of other kinds of fish every week with a maximum of 6 ounces albacore tuna per week; and check local advisories about eating locally caught fish. If no advice is posted, limit your intake of locally caught fish to 6 ounces per week and consume no other fish during that same week.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Good dental care begins at birth even before baby teeth appear! Healthy teeth let children chew food easier, learn to talk clearly, and smile with self-assurance.       Make cleaning your baby's teeth and gums part of the daily bathtub routine. Starting at birth, clean your baby's gums with a soft infant toothbrush and water, or use a clean, wet washcloth or gauze pad. Do this after every feeding. Skip toothpaste, which babies often swallow.   Schedule your baby's first visit to a pediatric dentist after the first tooth appears (at about six to 12 months).   Fluoride is a mineral that helps teeth develop and resist decay. In many places, fluoride is naturally present in local water supplies at various levels. If you live in an area that doesn't have fluoridated water, ask your baby's doctor if your baby or child needs a fluoride supplement. Unless your child's dentist advises otherwise, wait until after age two or three years to start with fluoridated toothpaste.    To avoid tooth decay, do not put your infant, toddler, or young child to bed with a bottle of juice, formula, or milk. The liquid that bathes the teeth and gums from sucking on the bottle stays on teeth and can cause tooth decay. That happens even if a baby's teeth haven't yet erupted through the gums. If your child won't nap or go to bed without a bottle, fill it with plain water instead.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Phenylketonuria, or PKU, is a genetically inherited birth defect that causes an unwanted buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood. This buildup occurs because the enzyme that routinely converts one amino acid, phenylalanine, to another amino acid, tyrosine, is absent or deficient. Phenylalanine then accumulates in the blood and is toxic to brain tissue.    PKU at Birth   Babies born in the United States are screened for PKU with a blood test so treatment can begin immediately and prevent the adverse side effects of the condition, such as declining intelligence, neurological deterioration, stunted growth, hyperactivity and seizures. A treatment team typically consists of a metabolic dietitian, physician, geneticist and psychologist as an infant is monitored during different phases of growth and development in childhood to an adult.   A strict diet limited in phenylalanine is the main treatment for PKU. Phenylalanine is found in most protein-containing foods such as milk, eggs, cheese, nuts, soybeans, chicken, beef, pork, beans and fish. ""An infant will have to consume a special phenylalanine-free formula for the first year of life,"" says Sarah Krieger, MPH, RDN, LDN, former pokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. However, some breast milk can be used in limited amounts.   Creating an Unique Meal Plan   As the infant grows and becomes developmentally ready for solid foods, a registered dietitian nutritionist with expertise in PKU will create a unique menu for the child. ""The metabolic dietitian can create meal plans with modified food sources of protein low in phenylalanine and high in tyrosine, while providing adequate calories, vitamins and minerals to support growth,"" says Krieger. Because so many foods are off limits with PKU, the meal plans include special formulas which are often the primary source of calories and essential nutrients. Special phenylalanine-free foods are available for children and teens with PKU. The metabolic dietitian will create individual eating plans and modify them as needed to promote healthy growth and development.    The diet needs to be followed for life. ""The individual with PKU will require blood monitoring to maintain serum phenylalanine levels,"" says Kreiger. In conjunction with blood monitoring, the metabolic dietitian will regularly review diet records or food journals and growth charts, making adjustments to the eating plan as needed.    Parents of children with PKU need to be creative with foods and use available PKU cookbooks. Get help with menu planning from the metabolic dietitian and plan ahead for eating out, school lunches, potlucks, trips and vacations, and other special events. Try to center special occasions around activities rather than food, and encourage your child to be part of the management of his or her diet as early as possible. ""A skilled dietitian, physician and psychologist team can address social issues with each stage of life,"" says Kreiger. ""Knowledge is power and the more parents, and eventually the child, know how to live with PKU, then a healthy, productive life is possible.""

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    If you're concerned about the amount of sugar in your child's diet you might be wondering if artificial sweeteners are a smart alternative. ""The safety of artificial sweeteners has been studied for years and, used in moderation, they are perfectly safe for kids,"" says Sarah Krieger, MPH, RD, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""Unlike sugar, they dont cause cavities or add calories to food and they can be a helpful alternative for children with diabetes.""    Despite what you may have heard, artificial sweeteners like aspartame, saccharine, neotame, acesulfame-K and sucralose dont cause birth defects or cancer and they arent linked to behavior problems. Because they are hundreds of times sweeter than sugar, only tiny amounts are needed to equal the sweetening power of sugar. Before the government approves the use of any sweetener it carefully scrutinizes:     How it is made   Which foods it will be used in   How much the average person will eat each day   If it is potentially harmful to a person's health     It then sets a limit for the amount that a person can safely consume based on their body weight. That limit is usually many times more than the average child will ever eat. For example, a 40-pound child would need to eat 24 packets of aspartame or drinkfour 12-ounce cans of diet soda every day to reach this level.   That said, there is one group of kids who cant eat all artificial sweeteners: those with phenylketonuria (or PKU). People with PKU aren't able to metabolize phenylalanine, an amino acid in aspartame, so they're advised to steer clear of aspartame.    If your child is eating the occasional artificially sweetened food you have nothing to worry about. But, before you stock your fridge with artificially sweetened foods and drinks, rememberthat many of these  such as sugar free ice cream and fruit flavored drinks aren't always the most nutritious choices and can still fill kids up with empty calories. ""Instead satisfy your child's sweet tooth naturally by mixing fresh berries into creamy low-fat yogurt, slicing bananas on a whole grain waffle, or stirring chopped pears into a steaming bowl of oatmeal,"" says Krieger.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    A mother's food and nutrition choices before and during pregnancy can greatly contribute to the future health of her children. Women living a healthy lifestyle deliver children with fewer birth defects and chronic health problems. So what makes a lifestyle ""healthy?"" For pregnant women, key habits include eating a variety of foods, ensuring adequate intake of vitamins and minerals, gaining an appropriate amount of weight, participating in regular physical activity and avoiding harmful substances.   Once the baby has arrived, it is important that newborns receive optimal nutrition from the beginning. Studies have shown that breast-feeding provides many advantages to both baby and mother  in terms of health benefits and financial savings. In addition to eating right from birth, developing physical activity habits at an early ageis also important. Active young children are better prepared for life than those who spend childhood sedentary in front of a television or video game screen.   Eating Right during Pregnancy   Moms-to-be need a variety of foods from all the  MyPlate  food groups to get the nutrition needed for a healthy pregnancy. Pregnant women need a balanced diet including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, low-fat dairy and healthful fats. A prenatal multivitamin/mineral supplement may be recommended by your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist to ensure that you get enough iron, folic acid and other nutrients. Safe food practices are important, too, since pregnant women are at higher risk of food poisoning.   Healthy Weight Gain during Pregnancy   While pregnancy is not the time to lose weight, women should not use their expanding bellies as an excuse to eat more than is necessary. The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite.   Many women start off pregnancy overweight or obese; many gain more weight than is healthy during their pregnancy. Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy is risky for both mother and child.   Breast-feeding Benefits   For optimal nutrition for your infant, the Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticsrecommends exclusively breast-feeding for the first six months to provide optimal nutrition and health protection, and continuing breast-feeding with the addition of complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12 months of age.   In addition to providing the best nutrition, breast-feeding reduces your baby's risk of ear infections, respiratory illnesses, gastrointestinal infections and possibly sudden infant death syndrome and obesity. Breast-feeding also provides mom with benefits including aiding in weight loss after delivery and reducing risk of breast and ovarian cancers.

In addition to suffering from gastrointestinal problems typically associated with celiac disease  such as diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain and bloating, and nausea or vomiting  some people with celiac disease may experience other diseases and chronic conditions as well. Following a gluten-free diet helps alleviate symptoms from these conditions associated with celiac disease.   Osteoporosis   A potentially crippling bone disease, osteoporosis is common in individuals with untreated celiac disease. Affected children, adolescents and adults have reduced bone mineral content and bone density, which improves when following a gluten-free diet. Children and adolescents who are treated early and make changes to their diet can achieve normal bone growth. Untreated adults who follow a gluten-free diet can improve, but may not reach normal bone density, especially if they did not follow the diet when they were children or adolescents.   Iron Deficiency Anemia   Anemia is a common condition related to celiac disease, due to intestinal damage that reduces the body's ability to absorb and use iron from food. Following a gluten-free diet helps the intestines heal, therefore improving nutrient absorption and blood iron levels; however, recovery from iron deficiency itself may take longer and iron supplementation may be needed to completely restore blood levels and correct deficiencies. A registered dietitian nutritionist can provide diet and supplementation guidance for iron deficiency anemia.   Pregnancy Risks   Several studies have found that women with undiagnosed celiac disease, or who were not following a gluten-free diet, had an increased risk of complications during pregnancy including miscarriage, premature delivery and stillbirth. These studies also indicated a higher risk for breech position and the need for cesarean delivery. Infants of these mothers were at higher risk for low birth weight and smaller than expected size. The infants also had low scores on a test given at birth to determine medical problems requiring immediate care and later experienced developmental delay. In addition, women with untreated celiac disease had a higher risk for earlier onset of menstruation and premature menopause. Adhering to a gluten-free diet reduces the risk of these complications.         Reviewed October 2016         Tags     Health   Diseases and Conditions   Celiac Disease"

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    The choices parents make in feeding their infants can have a lifetime impact on your child's health and weight. Research shows breast-feeding can reduce the risk of ear infections, stomach viruses and childhood leukemia. It also increases children's chance of having a healthy weight later in life.   The first year is when humans grow fastest. Most babies double their birth weight by 5 to 6 months old and triple it by one year. Health care providers check height and weight at each visit to make sure infants are gaining enough, but not too much, weight. Some studies suggest early overfeeding and excessive weight gain during infancy may increase the risk of childhood weight problems later on.   Supporting Normal Eating and Healthy Growth   Take a balanced approach to weight gain during your baby's first years. Parents should not put babies or children on diets or restrict their intake of nutrient-rich foods.   Your goal is to help infants regulate their own food intake based on internal cues of hunger and fullness. This helps them eat what they need for healthy growth and development. Discuss your baby's weight gain pattern with your health care provider at every checkup so you know how your child is growing.   Food Timeline for the First Two Years   All babies are unique individuals. Talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian nutritionist about the nutrient-rich foods your baby needs and when to introduce them. Here are the usual age ranges for moving infants from breast milk to table foods.     Birth to 6 Months: Babies get all the nutrients they need from breast milk for the first six months. Infant formula is an acceptable alternative when mothers decide to decrease or discontinue breast-feeding. You should not give your baby cow's milk until after age 1.   By 4 to 6 Months: While most babies are ready to eat solid foods now, they will continue to get most of their calories, protein, vitamins and minerals from breast milk or infant formula. Introduce iron-fortified infant cereal or pureed meats to help replenish iron reserves.   By 6 to 8 Months: This is an appropriate time to begin pureed or mashed fruits and vegetables. Gradually introduce single-item foods one at a time. Watch carefully for any reactions such as diarrhea, vomiting or unusual rashes.   By 7 to 10 Months: Babies are usually ready to begin feeding themselves with finger foods, such as dry cereal or teething biscuits. They also can begin to use a cup for water.   By 8 to 12 Months: At this stage, most infants are ready for soft or cooked table foods.   From 1 to 2 Years: Babies continue developing eating skills. They feed themselves and enjoy the same foods as the rest of the family. Choking on firm, round foods is a risk, so cut these foods into smaller, -inch squares.   Look out for other choking hazards, including nuts and seeds, popcorn, pretzels, raw carrots and celery, whole olives and cherry tomatoes, hot dogs, whole grapes, large pieces of meat, hard candy and cough drops, chewing gum, gummy candy, marshmallows and cherries with pits.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Originally considered one vitamin, the B-vitamin group is actually diverse in their makeup and function. The most common B-vitamins  B1 or thiamin, B2 or riboflavin, niacin, B6 or pyridoxine, and B12 are essential for supporting your body's metabolism rate, producing energy and aiding your body in fighting disease and infection.   Research shows folate (folic acid), another important component of the B-vitamins, is important for a healthy pregnancy, reducing the risk of serious birth defects of the spine and brain, also known as neural tube defects. Easing folic acid into your eating plan is easy: the delicious way is by eating folate-rich foods. Since 1998, enriched bread, cereal, pasta, flour, crackers and rice have been fortified with folic acid. You probably already eat some foods that have folate because many fruits and vegetables  including oranges (a good source) and avocado (an excellent source) are sources of this vitamin.   Food sources of B-vitamins and folate include:     Vitamin B1 (Thiamin):   Pork, green peas and whole-grain and enriched-grain products including bread, rice, pasta, tortillas and fortified cereals   Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin):  Milk and dairy foods, enriched bread and other grain products, lean meats, eggs and leafy green vegetables such as spinach   Niacin:  High-protein foods including peanut butter, beef, poultry, fish, avocado and enriched and fortified grain products   Vitamin B6 (Pyridoxine):  Baked potato, banana, beef, fortified cereals, nuts, beans, pork, chicken and fish   Vitamin B12:  Milk and dairy foods, meat, fish (especially salmon), poultry and eggs   Folate:  Orange juice, spinach, Romaine lettuce, broccoli, peanuts, avocado, enriched grain products and fortified breakfast cereals.

Until solid foods are introduced preferably at about six months breast milk can be a complete source of nutrition for infants. However, three nutrients may warrant additional consideration. Ask your doctor for advice.    Iron.  Iron is important for the manufacture of hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout the body. Iron also is essential for your baby's brain development and growth.   Premature infants who breast-feed may need iron supplementation earlier. They had less time to build adequate iron reserves before birth.   Fluoride.  Your baby's teeth started to develop even before you could see them. Fluoride, a mineral often found in tap water, helps develop strong teeth and prevent cavities later.   Breast milk contains little fluoride even if the mother's drinking water is fluoridated. If your breast-fed infant takes supplemental formula made with fluoridated water at least 0.3 ppm (parts per million) of fluoride your baby may get enough fluoride. If your child is breast-fed only or drinks formula made with well water, distilled water, unfluoridated bottled water or city unfluoridated water, your doctor may advise a fluoride supplement starting at about six months. Breast-fed infants who take supplemental ready-to-use formula also may need a fluoride supplement; these formulas usually are prepared with water low in fluoride.   Vitamin D.  This vitamin helps your baby use calcium from breast milk (and infant formula) to help bones grow and develop. When it is exposed to sunlight, the body can make vitamin D but a baby's skin should be protected from sunlight with sunscreen or clothing.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Breast-feeding requires extra nutrition, making healthy eating just as important post-pregnancy. Women who are breast-feeding use about 500 calories daily to make the full amount of milk most babies need from birth to 6 months. Two-thirds of those calories should come from meals and snacks containing foods from all five food groups. The remaining calories come from the weight gained during pregnancy. While many women find breast-feeding helps them lose weight, weight loss varies among mothers depending on physical activity, the amount of weight gained during pregnancy and how much breast milk is produced.   A slow, gradual weight loss of 1 pound per week or 4 pounds per month is a safe goal for breast-feeding moms who want to return to their pre-pregnancy weight. Women who eat less than 1,800 calories per day may reduce the amount of milk their bodies make. Stress, anxiety and fatigue can also decrease milk production. Do yourself and your baby a favor  relax and sit down to eat three meals per day. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and choose healthy snacks between meals. Moderate physical activity, such as walking, is also good for you and will not reduce milk volume.   Choosing the Right Foods   Eating right while breast-feeding is not complicated and it does not need to be bland. Mothers from many cultures breast-feed successfully on a diet of widely varied foods. Follow these guidelines to reach a healthy weight while keeping your baby well-nourished.     Eat a variety of foods from all five food groups. Visit  ChooseMyPlate.gov  to get a personalized eating plan for breast-feeding women.   For protein, choose lean meat, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, nuts and seeds. Eat no more than 12 ounces per week of fish and shellfish and no more than 6 ounces per week of albacore tuna. Avoid fish with high mercury levels, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish.   Eat colorful fruits and vegetables. Fill half your plate with vegetables and fruit at lunch and dinner, and include fruit and vegetables in snacks. Whole fruit is better than juice, so limit juice to 1 cup per day and make sure its 100-percent juice.   Include three servings of low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt or cheese each day. If you dont think you can tolerate milk, try lactose-free milk or calcium-fortified soy milk.   Choose whole-wheat bread, brown rice and whole-wheat pasta more often than refined grains.   Use healthful oils, such as olive oil, canola, soybean and corn oil, but in small amounts since they can amount to extra calories.   Drink enough water and decaffeinated unsweetened beverages to quench your thirst. While you are breast-feeding, your need for fluids increases. Limit caffeine-containing beverages  including coffee, tea and soft drinks  to one or two 8-ounce cups a day.   Make smart food choices that are low in empty calories. Empty calories are found in foods high in added sugars and fats including soft drinks, desserts, fried foods and fatty meats.   Vitamin and mineral supplements cannot replace a healthy diet. Talk with your doctor before taking any vitamin or mineral supplements.   If you have special nutrition needs, consult a  registered dietitian nutritionist  for a customized eating plan.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    While pregnancy is not the time to lose weight, women should not use their expanding bellies as a reason to eat more than is necessary. The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including her body mass index, or BMI, before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite. All pregnant women should eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods each day. It may also be necessary to take a vitamin and mineral supplement if recommended by a physician.   Many women start off pregnancy with an overweight or obese BMI and many gain more weight than is healthy during their pregnancy. Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy is risky for both mother and child, with some risks including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension (high blood pressure), Cesarean delivery, birth defects and even fetal death. If a women is obese during pregnancy, it also raises the chance her child will be obese later in life.   Weight Gain Guidelines   The latest weight gain guidelines by the Institute of Medicine are based on a women's BMI before pregnancy. ( See Understanding Body Mass Index (BMI) .) The amount of weight gained depends on which category the pre-pregnancy BMI lands in:     Underweight:  BMI below 18.5   Normal weight:  18.5 to 24.9   Overweight:  25.0 to 29.9   Obese:  30.0 and above     The weight ranges below are for a full-term pregnancy:     Underweight:  28 to 40 pounds   Normal:  25 to 35 pounds   Overweight:  15 to 25 pounds   Obese:  11 to 20 pounds     For twins, the recommendations naturally go up:     Normal:  37 to 54 pounds   Overweight:  31 to 50 pounds   Obese:  25 to 42 pounds     There are no set guidelines for underweight BMI weight gain with twins.   Calorie Intake   In general, pregnant women need between 2,200 calories and 2,900 calories a day. A gradual increase in calories as the baby grows is the best bet. Here is an overview of how calorie needs change during each trimester:     The first trimester does not require any extra calories.   During the second trimester, an additional 340 calories a day are recommended.   For the third trimester, the recommendation is 450 calories more a day than when not pregnant.     Additional calories should come from nutrient-dense foods including lean protein, whole grains, dairy, vegetables and fruit. Avoid unneeded extra calories by cutting down on foods high in fat and added sugars such as regular soda, sweets and fried foods.   Physical Activity   Physical activity can help manage weight gain. The activity guidelines for pregnant women are 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days of the week. Make sure to talk with a doctor before starting or continuing any exercise routine while pregnant.         Reviewed January 2017         Tags     Health   Pregnancy   Prenatal Wellness   For Women"

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    The 40 (or so) weeks of pregnancy are a magical time. Keeping a healthy lifestyle throughout pregnancy, as well as before and after, is key for both baby and mother. Important steps to a healthy pregnancy include eating a balanced diet; gaining the right amount of weight; enjoying regular physical activity; taking a vitamin and mineral supplement if recommended by a physician; and avoiding alcohol, tobacco and other harmful substances.   Foods Fit for Mom and Baby     Moms-to-be need a variety of foods from all the  MyPlate  food groups. A balanced diet with a variety of foods can provide healthy women with enough nutrients for pregnancy. Safe food practices are important, too,  since pregnant women are at higher risk of food poisoning .   Pregnant women need a balanced diet including:     Whole grains:  Breads, cereals, pastas and brown rice.   Fruits:  All types of fruits, fresh, frozen or canned without added sugars.   Vegetables:  Eat a variety of colorful vegetables, fresh, frozen or canned with no added salt. Raw sprouts should be avoided.   Lean protein:  Choose lean protein from meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans and peas, peanut butter, soy products and nuts. Pregnant women should avoid eating tilefish, shark, swordfish and king mackerel, and limit white (albacore) tuna to 6 ounces per week. Deli, luncheon meats and hot dogs should be reheated if consumed.   Low-fat or fat-free dairy:  This includes milk, cheese and yogurt. Unpasteurized milk and some soft cheeses that are made from unpasteurized milk also should be avoided.   Healthful fats:  From foods such as avocados, nuts and seeds as well as vegetable oils including canola and olive oil.     Avoid extra calories from added sugars and solid fats, which can lead to  unhealthy weight gain . Cut down on foods such as regular soda, sweets and fried snacks.   Key Nutrients for Healthy Pregnancy     Folic Acid:  Folic acid reduces the risk of birth defects that affect the spinal cord. All women of childbearing age and pregnant women should consume at least 400 micrograms of folic acid each day. Natural food sources of folate include legumes, green leafy vegetables and citrus fruits. Folate also can be obtained through fortified foods such as cereals, pastas and bread as well as supplements.   Iron:  Maternal iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency during pregnancy. Pregnant women need at least 27 milligrams of iron each day. Foods with high and moderate amounts of iron include red meat, chicken and fish, fortified cereals, spinach, some leafy greens and beans. For vegetarians and women who do not eat a lot of meat, increase iron absorption by combining plant-based sources of iron with vitamin C-rich foods. For example, try spinach salad with mandarin oranges or cereal with strawberries.   Calcium:  During pregnancy, calcium is needed for the healthy development of a baby's teeth, bones, heart, nerves and muscles. When a pregnant woman does not consume enough calcium, it is taken from her bones for the baby. It is important to consume adequate amounts of calcium daily before, during and after pregnancy. The recommended amount of calcium during pregnancy is 1,300 milligrams per day for adolescents 14 to 18 years old and 1,000 milligrams per day for women aged 19 to 50. That means at least three daily servings of calcium-rich foods such as low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt or cheese or calcium-fortified plant-based beverages, cereals and juices.     Your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist may recommend a prenatal vitamin/mineral supplement to help ensure that you get enough iron, folic acid and other nutrients.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) agree: Well-planned vegetarian and vegan eating patterns are healthy for infants and toddlers.   Time and attention are necessary to help young children, vegetarian or not, get all the nutrients they need for normal growth and development.   For the first six months, all babies do best with breast milk. Use iron-fortified formula (soy for vegans) if breast-feeding is decreased or stopped. Cow's milk, soy milk, rice milk and homemade formulas are not appropriate for babies during the first year because they have the wrong ratio of protein, fat and carbohydrate. They are also missing important nutrients for health, growth and development.   Solid foods can be introduced in the same way as for non-vegetarian infants. Replace meat with mashed or pureed tofu or beans and soy or dairy yogurt and cheese. (See  Introducing Solid Foods .)   Since breast milk is such a rich source of nutrients, vegan mothers may want to breast-feed for more than one year. Wean vegan infants with soy milk fortified with calcium and vitamins B12 and D. Milk alternatives, such as soy, rice, almond, hemp, etc., are not recommended during the first year of life as a primary drink because it is low in both protein and energy.   Nutrients Needing Special Attention   When feeding vegetarian or vegan children, pay close attention to the following nutrients:     Vitamin B12:  Vegetarians can get plenty of B12 from milk products and eggs. Vegans, both breast-feeding moms and children, need a good source of B12. Options include a supplement or fortified foods such as soy beverages, cereals and meat substitutes.   Vitamin D:  The AAP recommends all breast-fed infants receive 400 IU per day of supplemental vitamin D starting shortly after birth. This should continue until your child consumes the same amount of vitamin D from fortified milk: at least one quart per day of cow or soy milk.   Calcium:  Breast- and formula-fed babies, as well as toddlers who consume milk and dairy foods, usually get plenty of additional calcium from foods including yogurt and cheese. For vegan toddlers, calcium-fortified foods and beverages or supplements may be necessary. See a registered dietitian nutritionist for advice.   Iron:  The iron content of breast milk is low, even if moms are eating well. Babies are born with enough iron for 4 to 6 months. After this age, vegetarian and vegan infants need an outside source. Options include iron-fortified cereals or supplements.   Protein:  Babies need plenty of protein for rapid growth during the first year. Protein needs can be met with breast milk or formula until about 8 months. After that, add plant proteins from beans and cereals and fortified soy milks. Lacto-ovo toddlers can get protein from yogurt and eggs.   Fiber:  Lots of fiber can fill toddlers up quickly. Provide frequent meals and snacks. Use some refined grains, such as fortified cereals, breads and pasta, and higher-fat plant foods including sunflower butter and avocados to help vegetarian children meet their energy and nutrient needs.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    A balanced diet is a cornerstone of health. Women, like men, should enjoy a variety of foods, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, low-fat dairy and lean protein. But women also have special nutrient needs, and, during each stage of a woman's life, these needs change.   Eating Right   Nutrient-rich foods provide energy for women's busy lives and help to prevent disease. A healthy daily diet includes:     At least three 1-ounce servings of whole grains such as whole-grain bread, cereal, pasta, brown rice or oats.   Three servings of low-fat or fat-free dairy products including low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt or cheese.   Five to 6 ounces of protein such as lean meat, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, beans or peas and nuts.   Two cups of fruits  fresh, frozen or canned without added sugar.   Two-and-a-half cups of colorful vegetables  fresh, frozen or canned without added salt.      Iron-rich Foods   Iron is one of the keys to good health and energy levels in women. Iron-rich food sources include red meat, chicken, turkey, pork, fish, kale, spinach, beans, lentils and fortified breads and cereals. Plant-based sources of iron are more easily absorbed by your body when eaten with vitamin C-rich foods. So eat fortified cereal with strawberries on top, spinach salad with mandarin orange slices or add tomatoes to lentil soup.   Folic Acid During the Reproductive Years   When women reach childbearing age, they need to eat enough folic acid to decrease risk of birth defects. The requirement is at least 400 micrograms of folic acid a day. Be sure to consume adequate amounts of folic acid daily from fortified foods or supplements, in addition to food forms of folate from a varied diet. Citrus fruits, leafy greens, beans and peas naturally contain folate. There are many folic acid fortified foods such as cereals, rice and breads.   Daily Calcium Requirements   For healthy bones and teeth, women need to eat a variety of calcium-rich foods every day. Calcium keeps bones strong and prevents osteoporosis, a bone disease in which the bones become weak and break easily. Some calcium-rich foods include low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt and cheese, sardines, tofu (if made with calcium sulfate) and calcium-fortified foods including juices and cereals.   Foods to Limit   To keep weight in check at any age, women should avoid a lot of excess calories from added sugars, fat and alcohol.     Limit regular soft drinks, sugar-sweetened beverages, candy, baked goods and fried foods.   Limit alcohol intake to one drink per day. One drink is equal to 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of liquor.   Opt for low-fat dairy and meat products instead of their full-fat counterparts.     Eat fewer foods that are high in saturated fat  the kind found in fatty meats, sausages, cheese and full-fat dairy products, baked goods and pizza.   Balancing Calories with Activity   Since women typically have less muscle, more fat and are smaller than men, you need fewer calories to maintain a healthy body weight and activity level. Moderately active women need 1,800 to 2,200 calories a day. Women who are more physically active may require more calories.   Exercise is an important part of a woman's health. Regular daily activity helps with weight control, muscle strength and stress management.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Healthy weight management is all about energy balance. That means eating smarter and moving more. Unfortunately, when trying to lose weight, many busy people tend to limit some of the very foods they need the most. Here are some tasty ways to get the essential energizing nutrients your body craves and to cut back on unnecessary calories at the same time.   Carbohydrates   The biggest problem with low-carb diets is they restrict your body's preferred energy source. If you want to cut back on calories from carbohydrates, focus on reducing your intake of sugar-sweetened beverages such as soft drinks, candy and other foods with added sugars. To maximize your energy level and long-term health, look to nutrient-rich carbohydrate sources such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans and peas.   Protein   One of the most satisfying ways to eat and control weight is to include lean protein in every meal. Try low-fat dairy foods, eggs, lean meats, poultry, seafood, nuts and beans. Protein may be especially helpful in the morning. Add some protein to breakfast and you'll probably be satisfied until lunchtime. Chances are you won't be as tempted by all those high-fat, sugary mid-morning snacks.   Iron   Low iron intakes can lead to serious problems such as iron-deficiency anemia, the most common nutrient deficiency for premenopausal women and children. To prevent anemia and fatigue, women between the ages of 19 and 50 should get 18 milligrams of iron per day. Pump up your intake with excellent iron sources, such as lean red meat and iron-fortified cereals. Other good sources include poultry, fish, beans and leafy green vegetables. When relying on plant foods for iron, consume a source of vitamin C, such a strawberries or tomatoes, with the iron-rich food to help your body absorb the iron.       Calcium   Calcium does a lot more than help build strong bones and teeth. Getting enough calcium helps keep your heart and muscles strong and may help prevent high blood pressure and colon cancer too. Those are plenty of reasons to enjoy high-calcium foods, such as low-fat dairy; calcium-set tofu; green leafy vegetables including kale, collard greens and broccoli; and calcium-fortified 100-percent fruit juice. Aim for at least 1,000 milligrams per day (more if you are younger than 18 or older than 50).   Folic Acid   Every woman of childbearing age needs 400 micrograms of folic acid every day. That's what it takes to reduce the risk of neural tube birth defects by 75 percent. Folic acid can also boost your immune function by producing disease-fighting white blood cells. Get your folic acid from tasty, nutrient-rich foods, such as whole grains, green leafy vegetables, oranges, berries, nuts, beans and enriched grain products.

4 Infant Supplements to Ask Your Pediatrician About

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Starting your baby on solid foods is exciting  and messy! Most babies start with a very small amount of solids at around 4 to 6 months old, slowly increasing their portion size. Then, at around 9 to 11 months old, you may start noticing a dramatic drop in how much breast milk or formula your baby drinks as he or she starts getting more nutrition and calories from solid foods.   Because of their changing dietary needs over this transition, it is important that infants get the nutrition they need to grow and develop.  For some children, this means filling nutritional gaps with carefully chosen supplements.     Iron   Babies are born with a store of iron that lasts them for about 4 to 6 months. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that full-term infants who are exclusively breast-fed be given an iron supplement starting at 4 months of age. Talk to your pediatrician to see if your infant needs an iron supplement. Children born premature or with a low birth weight may have reduced iron stores. If so, your pediatrician will probably recommend iron supplements until your baby's first birthday. Formula is generally iron-fortified, which means formula-fed babies rarely need an iron supplement.   As infants begin to eat more solid food, serving them iron-rich foods such as iron-fortified cereal, meat or beans at least twice a day will help them meet their iron needs. But, if your baby is over 6 months old, is breast-fed and is not eating iron-rich foods, your pediatrician may recommend an iron supplement.   To promote iron absorption from plant foods, combine iron-rich solid foods you serve to your child with vitamin C-rich foods in one meal. For example, pair a bean and rice puree or finger food meal with tomato sauce, fruit or a fruit puree.   Vitamin D   Vitamin D is important for healthy bones and prevention of chronic disease. Because low levels of vitamin D are so common, the American Academy of Pediatrics says all breast-fed infants  and formula-fed infants who drink less than 32 ounces of formula per day  should take a supplement. When starting solids, you can mix vitamin D drops in purees as well as add them to formula or water.   Fluoride   Before you determine if your baby needs fluoride, which is important for cavity prevention, you need to know levels of fluoride in your local water supply. Fluoride supplements are only available by prescription, so discuss this with your pediatrician.   Vitamin B 12   Vitamin B 12 , which prevents anemia and supports healthy neurological function, is found in animal products such as meat, fish, eggs and dairy, and is not a concern for most children. However, if you plan to introduce only plant-based foods into your child's diet, he or she may need a B 12  supplement. Formula-fed vegan babies can get their vitamin B 12  from a special fortified formula, most often soy-based. Vegan mothers who exclusively breast-feed should be sure to consume adequate vitamin B 12  through fortified foods and supplements in order to provide ample B 12  to her baby via breast milk.Vitamin B 12  is typically included in most over-the-counter infant vitamin drops and many ready-to-eat cereals and milk substitutes.   Before giving your infant any supplements, always consult with your pediatrician. Not all infants automatically need supplements when starting solids. Make sure to introduce your baby to a variety of foods in order to develop his or her palate and meet nutritional needs.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Young kids with healthy teeth have more than just beautiful smiles. Baby teeth help children speak and chew, while holding a place in the jaw for the permanent teeth that are still hiding under the gums. But, ""poor oral health [at any age] can impact general health,"" says Lisa Harper Mallonee, MPH, RD, LD, registered dietitian, registered dental hygienist and associate professor at Texas A&M Baylor College of Dentistry.    It's never too soon to start caring for your children's teeth. Before the first tooth even erupts, Malloonee says, ""You really should start swabbing the mouth after feedings with a soft cloth."" Beginning a few days after birth, wipe the gums with a soft baby washcloth to remove plaque that can cause decay in erupting teeth. Dental caries, or tooth decay, are little holes in the teeth caused by bacteria in the mouth, which thrive on the sugars in our diet and produce acids that attack the tooth. Dental caries are on the rise among children, especially between the ages of 2 and 11 years old. Fortunately, good oral hygiene and a healthy diet can prevent tooth and gum problems throughout life.   The Bad   ""Avoid putting babies to bed with a bottle,"" says Angela Lemond, RDN, CSP, LD, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""It's common for babies and toddlers to fall asleep while drinking."" When this happens, breast milk or formula sits on teeth and gums for long periods, providing an environment that tooth-decay-causing bacteria love.   As children get older and start eating a greater variety of foods, it's important to pay attention to their consumption of sweets and sticky foods, Lemond says. Frequently eating the following foods increases the risk of developing dental caries:     Sugar-sweetened beverages such as sodas, fruit drinks, sports and energy drinks, and sweetened teas and coffee, especially if sipped over a long period of time   Sticky foods like caramels, raisins and dried apricots, particularly when eaten alone   Lollipops and other hard candies that dissolve slowly   Desserts like cookies, cakes and brownies   Sugar, including brown sugar, honey, molasses and agave nectar     Grazing or snacking frequently throughout the day also increases the risk of caries. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics suggests that you allow at least two hours between snacks and meals.    The Good   Eating fresh fruits and vegetables helps protect teeth by stimulating the production of saliva, which cleanses the mouth and and makes it less acidic. Chewing sugar-free gum for 20 minutes after meals and snacks also can help prevent tooth decay.   Drinking water with food  and after a meal  helps eliminate bacteria and reduce acid production. And, if your water is fluoridated, you and your family are getting extra protection. ""Fluoride is a mineral that helps resist tooth decay by decreasing acid levels in the mouth and even aiding in the repair process of early decay,"" Lemond says.   Approximately three-quarters of Americans receive fluoridated water through their community water system, but some bottled waters dont contain fluoride, she says. If youre not consuming water with fluoride, talk to your dentist about other ways to get it, including topical fluoride treatments at your dentists office.   A good diet is critical for the health of the mouth and staying healthy, but it wont make up for poor dental hygiene. Continue to see your dentist for checkups and cleanings, and make sure to brush and floss regularly.         Jill Weisenberger, MS, RDN, CDE, FAND, is a nutrition writer based in Virginia.

5 Common Food-Drug Interactions

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    You've probably heard the warnings not to drink grapefruit juice with cholesterol medication. However, that isn't the only combination of food and drugs to avoid. Grapefruit juice can interact with numerous other medications, both prescription and over-the-counter. And many other foods commonly interact with drugs, too.   Steve Plogsted, BS, PharmD, BCNSP, CNSC, clinical pharmacist with Nutrition Support Service of Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, fills us in on five foods that most commonly interact with medications.   Grapefruit Juice   ""Grapefruit juice has the ability to interact with medications in various ways,"" says Plogsted. One way is by increasing the absorption of certain drugs  as is the case with some, but not all, cholesterol-lowering statins. MedinePlus recommends avoiding grapefruit juice if you are taking statins.   Grapefruit juice can also cause the body to metabolize drugs abnormally, resulting in lower or higher than normal blood levels of the drug. Many medications are affected in this way, including antihistamines, blood pressure drugs, thyroid replacement drugs, birth control, stomach acid-blocking drugs, and the cough suppressant dextromethorphan. It's best to avoid or significantly reduce intake of grapefruit juice when taking these medications.   But why is grapefruit juice of concern and not other citrus juices? According to Plogsted, grapefruit juice contains a class of compounds called furanocoumarins, which act in the body to alter the characteristics of these medications. Orange juice and other citrus juices do not contain these compounds. There is some concern for Seville oranges and the pummelo, which are relatives of the grapefruit.   Green Leafy Vegetables   Blood-thinning drugs such as Coumadin   (warfarin) interfere with vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Eating too much green leafy vegetables, which are high in vitamin K, can decrease the ability of blood-thinners to prevent clotting. But you don't have to give up greens altogether. Problems arise from significantly and suddenly increasing or decreasing intake, as it can alter the effectiveness of the medicine. So eat your greens in consistent amounts.   Natural Black Licorice (Glycyrrhiza)   According to Plogsted, glycyrrhiza  a natural ingredient used to make black licorice  can deplete the body of potassium while causing an increased retention of sodium. When the body is depleted of potassium, the activity of digoxin, a medication used to treat heart failure, can be greatly enhanced, resulting in the heart not beating properly.   Glycyrrhiza can also decrease the effectiveness of high blood pressure medicines. And people taking Coumadin   (warfarin) should beware that glycyrrhiza can break down the drug, resulting in an increase in the body's clotting mechanism.   Excessive amounts of natural licorice should be avoided when taking all of these medications. However, Plogsted notes that artificially-flavored black licorice doesn't contain glycyrrhiza and is not of concern.   Salt Substitutes   Consumers taking digoxin for heart failure or ACE inhibitors for high blood pressure should be careful with salt substitutes, which most often replace sodium with potassium. With an increased consumption of potassium, the effectiveness of digoxin can be decreased, resulting in heart failure. And those taking ACE inhibitors might see a significant increase in blood potassium levels, as these drugs are known to increase potassium.   ""There is no real need to avoid salt substitutes, although care should be taken when using the product,"" say Plogsted. ""If the consumer has decreased kidney function they should discuss the use of salt substitutes with their doctor.""   Tyramine-Containing Foods   High blood levels of the amino acid tyramine can cause an increase in blood pressure. Several medications interfere with the breakdown of tyramine, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) which treat depression, and drugs used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Plogsted advises those taking these drugs to steer clear of tyramine-rich foods. The list is lengthy and includes, but is not limited to: chocolate, aged and mature cheeses, smoked and aged/fermented meats, hot dogs, some processed lunch meats, fermented soy products and draft beers (canned and bottled beers are OK).   When receiving a prescription for a new medication or taking a new over-the-counter drug, Plogsted advises consumers to always read drug warning labels and ask their physician and/or pharmacist about which foods or other drugs they should avoid or be concerned about taking.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Vitamins do not provide energy, but they are crucial for turning food into energy. Although some research suggests the high activity levels of athletes may increase their vitamin needs, at present, the Institute of Medicine does not make vitamin recommendations specific to athletes. While vitamins will not enhance your performance, a shortage is sure to get you down.   Here's a view of the role vitamins play, as well as their Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI).   Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)   Thiamine helps break down carbohydrates and proteins for energy. However, taking more than the DRI does not appear to enhance performance.     DRI: 1.2mg (men), 1.1mg (women)   Good sources: Whole and enriched grains and fortified cereals     Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)   Riboflavin is integral to energy production. It also plays a role in red blood cell formation. Athletes need the DRI of this vitamin.     DRI: 1.3mg (men), 1.1mg (women)   Good sources: Almonds, milk, yogurt, wheat germ, fortified breads and cereals     Niacin   Niacin supports both anaerobic and aerobic performance. Too much or too little niacin can shift your body's use of energy from fat to carbohydrates or vice versa; this might affect performance.     DRI: 16mg (men), 14mg (women)   Good sources: Meat, fish, poultry, peanuts, peanut butter and enriched grain products     Vitamin B6   Vitamin B6 is involved in over 100 metabolic reactions in your body, including the production of energy and hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. Intakes below the DRI can hurt performance.     DRI: 1.3mg (31-50 years old), 1.7mg (men 51 years and over), 1.5mg (women 51 years and over)   Good sources: Meat, fish, poultry, eggs, beans whole grains, seeds and oysters     Vitamin B12   Because of its role in red blood cell formation, B12 is crucial for getting oxygen to tissues. B12 is only found in animal products, putting vegan and vegetarian athletes at risk for anemia. Such groups should try to get as much B12 from food as possible. Taking a B12 supplement or eating B12-fortified foods also may be needed.     DRI: 2.4mcg   Good sources: Seafood, meats, milk and cheese, eggs and fortified breakfast cereals     Folate   Folate is important for cell production, heart health and protection against birth defects. The DRI appears to be enough to support the energy demands of athletes. Female athletes of childbearing age should include folate in their diet every day.     DRI: 400mcg   Good sources: Enriched grains, dark leafy greens, whole-grain breads and cereals and citrus fruits     Vitamin C   Perhaps the most famous antioxidant, vitamin C offers a wide variety of health benefits, including protecting from infection and damage to body cells, helping produce collagen (the connective tissue that holds bones and muscles together), protecting your body from bruising by keeping capillary walls and blood vessels firm, and helping in the absorption of iron and folate.     DRI: 90mg (men), 75mg (women)   Good sources: citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruits and tangerines), strawberries, sweet peppers, tomatoes, broccoli and potatoes     Pantothenic Acid   This vitamin is needed for the breakdown of fats, proteins and carbohydrates into usable energy. It is found in almost all plant and animal foods. Athletes should aim to meet the adequate intake for pantothenic acid.     DRI: 5mg   Good sources: Poultry, seafood, nuts, seeds, avocados and whole grains     Biotin   Biotin plays an important role in energy production.     DRI: 30mcg   Good sources: Nuts, eggs, soybeans and fish     Vitamin D   Vitamin D is actually a hormone, not a vitamin. Your body can make its own vitamin D with enough sun exposure. Vitamin D is important for bone health; athletes in weight-sensitive sports  such as gymnastics, running or cycling  should take care to get enough. A physician may suggest vitamin D and/or calcium supplements for some athletes.     DRI: 600IU (1-70 years old), 800IU (71 years and over)   Good sources: Fortified milk and cereals, cod-liver oil, seafood and eggs           Reviewed September 2014         Tags     Food   Fitness   Vitamins and Supplements   Sports and Performance   Types of Vitamins and Nutrients   Dietary Supplements   Tips for Athletes"

Reviewed by Sharon Denny, MS, RDN       Published January 07, 2016           Print   Email                March is  National Nutrition Month , when the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics reminds everyone to return to the basics of healthy eating. It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Most of us know that good nutrition and a balanced diet are important for good health. However, when we hear buzzwords such as ""calcium deficiency"" or learn that a new multivitamin just hit the shelves, it can make us wonder if the food we're eating is enough. Hint: It likely is.   Taking a daily dose of any of the single minerals, vitamins or multivitamin/mineral supplements that line the shelves of supermarkets and drug stores can be tempting. According to the 2015  Dietary Guidelines for Americans , ""Nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods. Individuals should aim to meet their nutrient needs through healthy eating patterns that include nutrient-dense foods ... [which] contain essential vitamins and minerals and also dietary fiber and other naturally occurring substances that may have positive health effects.""  While there may be a need to supplement our diet at certain times in our lives, the safety of taking a supplement also needs to be considered.    Too much of some vitamins and minerals can cause health issues; and, therefore, recommended levels should not be exceeded.   Who needs supplements?   As it turns out, the best way to be and stay healthy is to choose a wide variety of nutritious foods from all five  MyPlate  food groups. Nutrient deficiencies are not common among Americans, but for varying reasons some people cannot reach the recommended nutrient amounts without using supplements and/or including fortified foods. In addition to a healthy and balanced diet, those individuals may need nutrient supplements depending on their situation. For example, older adults, pregnant women and people who are food insecure are at increased risk of nutrient deficiencies.   In addition, if you are eating less than 1,600 calories each day because you are trying to lose weight, you have a poor appetite or you have trouble eating because you have been using alcohol or drugs, discuss the need for supplements with your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist.   Some individuals are limited in their food choices due to allergies, a medical condition or because they are following a vegetarian or vegan diet. For example, animal foods are the main source of vitamin B12, so people who follow a vegan diet need to eat fortified foods and/or take a supplement.   Women who are at an age where they could become pregnant need to obtain adequate folic acid from fortified foods (cereals and other grains), supplements or both, in addition to consuming folate from foods in a varied diet. Because it helps reduce the risk of some birth defects, folic acid is very important during childbearing years. If lab tests show that a woman's iron status is low during pregnancy, her health-care provider will recommend an iron supplement.   Vitamin D might be a concern among infants, children and young adults. Infants who are breast-fed and children who consume less than the recommended amount of vitamin D fortified milk or formula and those with increased risk of deficiency will likely need supplemental vitamin D. Adolescent girls, meanwhile, might need additional iron.   On the other side of the spectrum, as people age it can be difficult to get enough vitamins B12 and D. Luckily, this is one of the cases where supplements can make a difference. Getting B12 from fortified foods or taking it alone or as part of a multivitamin mineral can help raise B12 in your blood. If you're taking calcium or a multivitamin, try to pick one up that also has vitamin D.   Other groups who may require additional supplementation include people who are taking certain medications or have a health condition that changes how their body uses nutrients, and individuals who have been told by their doctor they have a specific nutrient deficiency.   Your doctor can order tests to help determine if taking a supplement would benefit you. The results might show that you are low in a certain nutrient or you might discover that you're doing just fine. Additionally, review your current diet. An RDN can help you evaluate the foods you eat and make recommendations that meet your personal needs.   Remember, real food contains healthy things a pill can't give us. When we take a nutrient out of a food and concentrate it in a pill, it's not quite the same thing. Be sure to consider your individual situation and consult a doctor or an RDN before considering supplements.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Good dental care begins at birth even before baby teeth appear! Healthy teeth let children chew food easier, learn to talk clearly, and smile with self-assurance.       Make cleaning your baby's teeth and gums part of the daily bathtub routine. Starting at birth, clean your baby's gums with a soft infant toothbrush and water, or use a clean, wet washcloth or gauze pad. Do this after every feeding. Skip toothpaste, which babies often swallow.   Schedule your baby's first visit to a pediatric dentist after the first tooth appears (at about six to 12 months).   Fluoride is a mineral that helps teeth develop and resist decay. In many places, fluoride is naturally present in local water supplies at various levels. If you live in an area that doesn't have fluoridated water, ask your baby's doctor if your baby or child needs a fluoride supplement. Unless your child's dentist advises otherwise, wait until after age two or three years to start with fluoridated toothpaste.    To avoid tooth decay, do not put your infant, toddler, or young child to bed with a bottle of juice, formula, or milk. The liquid that bathes the teeth and gums from sucking on the bottle stays on teeth and can cause tooth decay. That happens even if a baby's teeth haven't yet erupted through the gums. If your child won't nap or go to bed without a bottle, fill it with plain water instead.

How to Create a PKU-Friendly Diet

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Phenylketonuria, or PKU, is a genetically inherited birth defect that causes an unwanted buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood. This buildup occurs because the enzyme that routinely converts one amino acid, phenylalanine, to another amino acid, tyrosine, is absent or deficient. Phenylalanine then accumulates in the blood and is toxic to brain tissue.    PKU at Birth   Babies born in the United States are screened for PKU with a blood test so treatment can begin immediately and prevent the adverse side effects of the condition, such as declining intelligence, neurological deterioration, stunted growth, hyperactivity and seizures. A treatment team typically consists of a metabolic dietitian, physician, geneticist and psychologist as an infant is monitored during different phases of growth and development in childhood to an adult.   A strict diet limited in phenylalanine is the main treatment for PKU. Phenylalanine is found in most protein-containing foods such as milk, eggs, cheese, nuts, soybeans, chicken, beef, pork, beans and fish. ""An infant will have to consume a special phenylalanine-free formula for the first year of life,"" says Sarah Krieger, MPH, RDN, LDN, former pokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. However, some breast milk can be used in limited amounts.   Creating an Unique Meal Plan   As the infant grows and becomes developmentally ready for solid foods, a registered dietitian nutritionist with expertise in PKU will create a unique menu for the child. ""The metabolic dietitian can create meal plans with modified food sources of protein low in phenylalanine and high in tyrosine, while providing adequate calories, vitamins and minerals to support growth,"" says Krieger. Because so many foods are off limits with PKU, the meal plans include special formulas which are often the primary source of calories and essential nutrients. Special phenylalanine-free foods are available for children and teens with PKU. The metabolic dietitian will create individual eating plans and modify them as needed to promote healthy growth and development.    The diet needs to be followed for life. ""The individual with PKU will require blood monitoring to maintain serum phenylalanine levels,"" says Kreiger. In conjunction with blood monitoring, the metabolic dietitian will regularly review diet records or food journals and growth charts, making adjustments to the eating plan as needed.    Parents of children with PKU need to be creative with foods and use available PKU cookbooks. Get help with menu planning from the metabolic dietitian and plan ahead for eating out, school lunches, potlucks, trips and vacations, and other special events. Try to center special occasions around activities rather than food, and encourage your child to be part of the management of his or her diet as early as possible. ""A skilled dietitian, physician and psychologist team can address social issues with each stage of life,"" says Kreiger. ""Knowledge is power and the more parents, and eventually the child, know how to live with PKU, then a healthy, productive life is possible.""

The Inside Scoop on Artificial Sweeteners

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    If you're concerned about the amount of sugar in your child's diet you might be wondering if artificial sweeteners are a smart alternative. ""The safety of artificial sweeteners has been studied for years and, used in moderation, they are perfectly safe for kids,"" says Sarah Krieger, MPH, RD, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""Unlike sugar, they dont cause cavities or add calories to food and they can be a helpful alternative for children with diabetes.""    Despite what you may have heard, artificial sweeteners like aspartame, saccharine, neotame, acesulfame-K and sucralose dont cause birth defects or cancer and they arent linked to behavior problems. Because they are hundreds of times sweeter than sugar, only tiny amounts are needed to equal the sweetening power of sugar. Before the government approves the use of any sweetener it carefully scrutinizes:     How it is made   Which foods it will be used in   How much the average person will eat each day   If it is potentially harmful to a person's health     It then sets a limit for the amount that a person can safely consume based on their body weight. That limit is usually many times more than the average child will ever eat. For example, a 40-pound child would need to eat 24 packets of aspartame or drinkfour 12-ounce cans of diet soda every day to reach this level.   That said, there is one group of kids who cant eat all artificial sweeteners: those with phenylketonuria (or PKU). People with PKU aren't able to metabolize phenylalanine, an amino acid in aspartame, so they're advised to steer clear of aspartame.    If your child is eating the occasional artificially sweetened food you have nothing to worry about. But, before you stock your fridge with artificially sweetened foods and drinks, rememberthat many of these  such as sugar free ice cream and fruit flavored drinks aren't always the most nutritious choices and can still fill kids up with empty calories. ""Instead satisfy your child's sweet tooth naturally by mixing fresh berries into creamy low-fat yogurt, slicing bananas on a whole grain waffle, or stirring chopped pears into a steaming bowl of oatmeal,"" says Krieger.

A Healthy Start to Reduce Childhood Obesity

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    A mother's food and nutrition choices before and during pregnancy can greatly contribute to the future health of her children. Women living a healthy lifestyle deliver children with fewer birth defects and chronic health problems. So what makes a lifestyle ""healthy?"" For pregnant women, key habits include eating a variety of foods, ensuring adequate intake of vitamins and minerals, gaining an appropriate amount of weight, participating in regular physical activity and avoiding harmful substances.   Once the baby has arrived, it is important that newborns receive optimal nutrition from the beginning. Studies have shown that breast-feeding provides many advantages to both baby and mother  in terms of health benefits and financial savings. In addition to eating right from birth, developing physical activity habits at an early ageis also important. Active young children are better prepared for life than those who spend childhood sedentary in front of a television or video game screen.   Eating Right during Pregnancy   Moms-to-be need a variety of foods from all the  MyPlate  food groups to get the nutrition needed for a healthy pregnancy. Pregnant women need a balanced diet including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, low-fat dairy and healthful fats. A prenatal multivitamin/mineral supplement may be recommended by your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist to ensure that you get enough iron, folic acid and other nutrients. Safe food practices are important, too, since pregnant women are at higher risk of food poisoning.   Healthy Weight Gain during Pregnancy   While pregnancy is not the time to lose weight, women should not use their expanding bellies as an excuse to eat more than is necessary. The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite.   Many women start off pregnancy overweight or obese; many gain more weight than is healthy during their pregnancy. Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy is risky for both mother and child.   Breast-feeding Benefits   For optimal nutrition for your infant, the Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticsrecommends exclusively breast-feeding for the first six months to provide optimal nutrition and health protection, and continuing breast-feeding with the addition of complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12 months of age.   In addition to providing the best nutrition, breast-feeding reduces your baby's risk of ear infections, respiratory illnesses, gastrointestinal infections and possibly sudden infant death syndrome and obesity. Breast-feeding also provides mom with benefits including aiding in weight loss after delivery and reducing risk of breast and ovarian cancers.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Eating the same way in your 40s as you did in your 20s? Ignoring your nutritional needs when you're 60? Not you! Build your best, healthiest body by adjusting your diet and eating habits to address the specific needs of each decade.   20s: Bone Building   In your 20s, you're still building up bone density, so this is the decade to help your bones grow strong and healthy. ""You really want to make those bones as dense as you can while you're young, during those bone-growing years,"" says registered dietitian nutritionist Ruth Frechman. She calls it ""filling the bank"" because in later years, your body will lose some of that bone, so the more you start with the better off you are.   Enter calcium, which not only builds strong bones but is also important for healthy muscles, nerves and heart. You need 1,000 milligrams per day, so enjoy dairy products, opt for calcium-fortified orange juice and cereals, and load up on beans, leafy greens, almonds and canned salmon with bones.   Young women don't need to pass up dairy products for fear of gaining weight. Instead choose fat-free or low-fat milk and yogurt, reduced-fat cheese and for a sweet treat pick fat-free calcium-fortified hot cocoa, says Frechman.   30s: Baby on Board   These days, women are having babies well into their 30s, which makes folic acid an important nutrient during this decade. Folic acid helps prevent neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida. Unfortunately, ""Many studies have shown that folic acid is one of those nutrients that we tend to run low in,"" says Jeannie Moloo, RD.   For women who plan on becoming pregnant, the 2010  Dietary Guidelines  recommend consuming 400 micrograms per day of folic acid from fortified foods and/or supplements, in addition to foods high in folate. Many breads, cereals and grain products are fortified with folic acid; fruits and vegetables are good sources of folate. If you're trying to get pregnant, your doctor may recommend a folic acid supplement.    Moloo also calls the 30s the ""prevention decade,"" meaning, if you haven't already, it's time to start thinking about how to prevent chronic diseases that become more prevalent as we age.    Look to foods containing healthy fats such as omega-3 fats and monounsaturated fats.     Found in nuts, olive and canola oils and avocados, monounsaturated fats improve blood cholesterol levels, which can decrease your risk of heart disease, and they may help with keeping blood sugar levels in check (potentially helpful for appetite control and reducing the risk for diabetes). A few studies have looked at monounsaturated fats as being beneficial for specifically reducing belly fat, but firm findings are lacking.   Scientists believe omega-3 fats (found in fish) may influence how fat is used and stored in the body. It's possible omega-3s push fat more toward energy use than to storage in your body. Omega-3s may help reduce body fat with or without cutting calories. Animal studies have supported the theory; human studies are encouraging, but not as conclusive. Add exercise on top of upping omega-3s and you can lose more body fat.     40s: Keeping Score   If you haven't been treating your body right, the 40s is where this will start showing up. ""You are starting the aging process,"" says Frechman. ""So you really want to make sure you're in tip-top shape.""   The 40s are a good time to be vigilant about eating plenty of fruits and vegetables. They're packed with vitamins, minerals, fiber and phytonutrients plus low in fat and calories. Adults need at least 2 cups of fruit and 2 cups of vegetables a day. Explore new tastes by trying a new fruit or vegetable a couple of times a month.   Try snacking on fruit including apples, bananas and clementines, opt for vegetable-packed, broth-based soups, salads piled with greens and smoothies with berries. If you don't like the taste of vegetables raw, try roasting them which makes them sweeter.   Another important nutrient for the 40-and-over set is fiber, which can help protect against heart disease and some types of cancer. Women under 50 need 25 grams per day, but most adults get only about half that amount. Luckily, the fruits and veggies you're eating for the vitamins and minerals are also rich in fiber, and whole grains and beans are other good sources.   50s: Calorie Counting   The 50s are a time of big changes thanks to perimenopause and menopause. ""Hormone fluctuations can be very dramatic, and with hormone fluctuations can come changes in metabolism,"" says Moloo. ""It's a time when women tend to have weight creep on, and it's that very metabolically active fat around the middle, which has been shown to drive diabetes and other health-related issues."" So Moloo suggests decreasing calorie intake and increasing activity levels if you start to experience weight gain.   Also essential: Vitamin D is used in every cell in the body, says Frechman. It's essential for bone health and researchers believe it may reduce the risk of some cancers, heart disease and infectious diseases. Vitamin D is difficult to get from food  the best sources are fortified milk, orange juice and cereals, as well as fish such as salmon and tuna.   The recommended daily amount of vitamin D recently increased to 600 IU per day for women ages 19 to 70, but the majority of adults don't get enough. Consult your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist about your need for a supplement.   60s and Beyond: Protein Power   Protein, along with regular strength building exercise, is essential for maintaining muscle, which we tend to lose as we age. Consuming enough protein may also be linked with bone health.   The average woman needs about 5 to 6 ounces of protein foods each day. Good sources include meat such as beef, chicken, fish, pork and lamb. Not a meat eater? You'll also find protein in eggs, beans, tofu and nuts, as well as low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt and cheese.   Vitamin B12 which helps your body make red blood cells and keep the brain and nervous system healthy  is another vital nutrient for women over 60. You can get B12 through any food that comes from an animal: meat, fish, dairy products and eggs. However, as people get older they can develop a reduced ability to absorb vitamin B12, says Frechman. She recommends talking to your doctor to see if you need a supplement.   Each decade brings with it specific health concerns and different nutrition needs. Eat right for your age and you'll sail through the decades feeling great.         Reviewed February 2015         Tags     Health   Wellness   Preventing Illness   For Women"

Safe food practices are important, too, since pregnant women are at higher risk of food poisoning.   Healthy Weight Gain during Pregnancy   While pregnancy is not the time to lose weight, women should not use their expanding bellies as an excuse to eat more than is necessary. The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite.   Many women start off pregnancy overweight or obese; many gain more weight than is healthy during their pregnancy. Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy is risky for both mother and child.   Breast-feeding Benefits   For optimal nutrition for your infant, the Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticsrecommends exclusively breast-feeding for the first six months to provide optimal nutrition and health protection, and continuing breast-feeding with the addition of complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12 months of age.   In addition to providing the best nutrition, breast-feeding reduces your baby's risk of ear infections, respiratory illnesses, gastrointestinal infections and possibly sudden infant death syndrome and obesity. Breast-feeding also provides mom with benefits including aiding in weight loss after delivery and reducing risk of breast and ovarian cancers.

Good dental care begins at birth even before baby teeth appear! Healthy teeth let children chew food easier, learn to talk clearly, and smile with self-assurance.       Make cleaning your baby's teeth and gums part of the daily bathtub routine. Starting at birth, clean your baby's gums with a soft infant toothbrush and water, or use a clean, wet washcloth or gauze pad. Do this after every feeding. Skip toothpaste, which babies often swallow.   Schedule your baby's first visit to a pediatric dentist after the first tooth appears (at about six to 12 months).   Fluoride is a mineral that helps teeth develop and resist decay. In many places, fluoride is naturally present in local water supplies at various levels. If you live in an area that doesn't have fluoridated water, ask your baby's doctor if your baby or child needs a fluoride supplement. Unless your child's dentist advises otherwise, wait until after age two or three years to start with fluoridated toothpaste.    To avoid tooth decay, do not put your infant, toddler, or young child to bed with a bottle of juice, formula, or milk. The liquid that bathes the teeth and gums from sucking on the bottle stays on teeth and can cause tooth decay. That happens even if a baby's teeth haven't yet erupted through the gums. If your child won't nap or go to bed without a bottle, fill it with plain water instead.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Phenylketonuria, or PKU, is a genetically inherited birth defect that causes an unwanted buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood. This buildup occurs because the enzyme that routinely converts one amino acid, phenylalanine, to another amino acid, tyrosine, is absent or deficient. Phenylalanine then accumulates in the blood and is toxic to brain tissue.    PKU at Birth   Babies born in the United States are screened for PKU with a blood test so treatment can begin immediately and prevent the adverse side effects of the condition, such as declining intelligence, neurological deterioration, stunted growth, hyperactivity and seizures. A treatment team typically consists of a metabolic dietitian, physician, geneticist and psychologist as an infant is monitored during different phases of growth and development in childhood to an adult.   A strict diet limited in phenylalanine is the main treatment for PKU. Phenylalanine is found in most protein-containing foods such as milk, eggs, cheese, nuts, soybeans, chicken, beef, pork, beans and fish. ""An infant will have to consume a special phenylalanine-free formula for the first year of life,"" says Sarah Krieger, MPH, RDN, LDN, former pokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. However, some breast milk can be used in limited amounts.   Creating an Unique Meal Plan   As the infant grows and becomes developmentally ready for solid foods, a registered dietitian nutritionist with expertise in PKU will create a unique menu for the child. ""The metabolic dietitian can create meal plans with modified food sources of protein low in phenylalanine and high in tyrosine, while providing adequate calories, vitamins and minerals to support growth,"" says Krieger. Because so many foods are off limits with PKU, the meal plans include special formulas which are often the primary source of calories and essential nutrients. Special phenylalanine-free foods are available for children and teens with PKU. The metabolic dietitian will create individual eating plans and modify them as needed to promote healthy growth and development.    The diet needs to be followed for life. ""The individual with PKU will require blood monitoring to maintain serum phenylalanine levels,"" says Kreiger. In conjunction with blood monitoring, the metabolic dietitian will regularly review diet records or food journals and growth charts, making adjustments to the eating plan as needed.    Parents of children with PKU need to be creative with foods and use available PKU cookbooks. Get help with menu planning from the metabolic dietitian and plan ahead for eating out, school lunches, potlucks, trips and vacations, and other special events. Try to center special occasions around activities rather than food, and encourage your child to be part of the management of his or her diet as early as possible. ""A skilled dietitian, physician and psychologist team can address social issues with each stage of life,"" says Kreiger. ""Knowledge is power and the more parents, and eventually the child, know how to live with PKU, then a healthy, productive life is possible.""

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    If you're concerned about the amount of sugar in your child's diet you might be wondering if artificial sweeteners are a smart alternative. ""The safety of artificial sweeteners has been studied for years and, used in moderation, they are perfectly safe for kids,"" says Sarah Krieger, MPH, RD, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""Unlike sugar, they dont cause cavities or add calories to food and they can be a helpful alternative for children with diabetes.""    Despite what you may have heard, artificial sweeteners like aspartame, saccharine, neotame, acesulfame-K and sucralose dont cause birth defects or cancer and they arent linked to behavior problems. Because they are hundreds of times sweeter than sugar, only tiny amounts are needed to equal the sweetening power of sugar. Before the government approves the use of any sweetener it carefully scrutinizes:     How it is made   Which foods it will be used in   How much the average person will eat each day   If it is potentially harmful to a person's health     It then sets a limit for the amount that a person can safely consume based on their body weight. That limit is usually many times more than the average child will ever eat. For example, a 40-pound child would need to eat 24 packets of aspartame or drinkfour 12-ounce cans of diet soda every day to reach this level.   That said, there is one group of kids who cant eat all artificial sweeteners: those with phenylketonuria (or PKU). People with PKU aren't able to metabolize phenylalanine, an amino acid in aspartame, so they're advised to steer clear of aspartame.    If your child is eating the occasional artificially sweetened food you have nothing to worry about. But, before you stock your fridge with artificially sweetened foods and drinks, rememberthat many of these  such as sugar free ice cream and fruit flavored drinks aren't always the most nutritious choices and can still fill kids up with empty calories. ""Instead satisfy your child's sweet tooth naturally by mixing fresh berries into creamy low-fat yogurt, slicing bananas on a whole grain waffle, or stirring chopped pears into a steaming bowl of oatmeal,"" says Krieger.

A mother's food and nutrition choices before and during pregnancy can greatly contribute to the future health of her children. Women living a healthy lifestyle deliver children with fewer birth defects and chronic health problems. So what makes a lifestyle ""healthy?"" For pregnant women, key habits include eating a variety of foods, ensuring adequate intake of vitamins and minerals, gaining an appropriate amount of weight, participating in regular physical activity and avoiding harmful substances.   Once the baby has arrived, it is important that newborns receive optimal nutrition from the beginning. Studies have shown that breast-feeding provides many advantages to both baby and mother  in terms of health benefits and financial savings. In addition to eating right from birth, developing physical activity habits at an early ageis also important. Active young children are better prepared for life than those who spend childhood sedentary in front of a television or video game screen.   Eating Right during Pregnancy   Moms-to-be need a variety of foods from all the  MyPlate  food groups to get the nutrition needed for a healthy pregnancy. Pregnant women need a balanced diet including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, low-fat dairy and healthful fats.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    In addition to suffering from gastrointestinal problems typically associated with celiac disease  such as diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain and bloating, and nausea or vomiting  some people with celiac disease may experience other diseases and chronic conditions as well. Following a gluten-free diet helps alleviate symptoms from these conditions associated with celiac disease.   Osteoporosis   A potentially crippling bone disease, osteoporosis is common in individuals with untreated celiac disease. Affected children, adolescents and adults have reduced bone mineral content and bone density, which improves when following a gluten-free diet. Children and adolescents who are treated early and make changes to their diet can achieve normal bone growth. Untreated adults who follow a gluten-free diet can improve, but may not reach normal bone density, especially if they did not follow the diet when they were children or adolescents.   Iron Deficiency Anemia   Anemia is a common condition related to celiac disease, due to intestinal damage that reduces the body's ability to absorb and use iron from food. Following a gluten-free diet helps the intestines heal, therefore improving nutrient absorption and blood iron levels; however, recovery from iron deficiency itself may take longer and iron supplementation may be needed to completely restore blood levels and correct deficiencies. A registered dietitian nutritionist can provide diet and supplementation guidance for iron deficiency anemia.   Pregnancy Risks   Several studies have found that women with undiagnosed celiac disease, or who were not following a gluten-free diet, had an increased risk of complications during pregnancy including miscarriage, premature delivery and stillbirth. These studies also indicated a higher risk for breech position and the need for cesarean delivery. Infants of these mothers were at higher risk for low birth weight and smaller than expected size. The infants also had low scores on a test given at birth to determine medical problems requiring immediate care and later experienced developmental delay. In addition, women with untreated celiac disease had a higher risk for earlier onset of menstruation and premature menopause. Adhering to a gluten-free diet reduces the risk of these complications.         Reviewed October 2016         Tags     Health   Diseases and Conditions   Celiac Disease"

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    The choices parents make in feeding their infants can have a lifetime impact on your child's health and weight. Research shows breast-feeding can reduce the risk of ear infections, stomach viruses and childhood leukemia. It also increases children's chance of having a healthy weight later in life.   The first year is when humans grow fastest. Most babies double their birth weight by 5 to 6 months old and triple it by one year. Health care providers check height and weight at each visit to make sure infants are gaining enough, but not too much, weight. Some studies suggest early overfeeding and excessive weight gain during infancy may increase the risk of childhood weight problems later on.   Supporting Normal Eating and Healthy Growth   Take a balanced approach to weight gain during your baby's first years. Parents should not put babies or children on diets or restrict their intake of nutrient-rich foods.   Your goal is to help infants regulate their own food intake based on internal cues of hunger and fullness. This helps them eat what they need for healthy growth and development. Discuss your baby's weight gain pattern with your health care provider at every checkup so you know how your child is growing.   Food Timeline for the First Two Years   All babies are unique individuals. Talk to your doctor or a registered dietitian nutritionist about the nutrient-rich foods your baby needs and when to introduce them. Here are the usual age ranges for moving infants from breast milk to table foods.     Birth to 6 Months: Babies get all the nutrients they need from breast milk for the first six months. Infant formula is an acceptable alternative when mothers decide to decrease or discontinue breast-feeding. You should not give your baby cow's milk until after age 1.   By 4 to 6 Months: While most babies are ready to eat solid foods now, they will continue to get most of their calories, protein, vitamins and minerals from breast milk or infant formula. Introduce iron-fortified infant cereal or pureed meats to help replenish iron reserves.   By 6 to 8 Months: This is an appropriate time to begin pureed or mashed fruits and vegetables. Gradually introduce single-item foods one at a time. Watch carefully for any reactions such as diarrhea, vomiting or unusual rashes.   By 7 to 10 Months: Babies are usually ready to begin feeding themselves with finger foods, such as dry cereal or teething biscuits. They also can begin to use a cup for water.   By 8 to 12 Months: At this stage, most infants are ready for soft or cooked table foods.   From 1 to 2 Years: Babies continue developing eating skills. They feed themselves and enjoy the same foods as the rest of the family. Choking on firm, round foods is a risk, so cut these foods into smaller, -inch squares.   Look out for other choking hazards, including nuts and seeds, popcorn, pretzels, raw carrots and celery, whole olives and cherry tomatoes, hot dogs, whole grapes, large pieces of meat, hard candy and cough drops, chewing gum, gummy candy, marshmallows and cherries with pits.

Research shows folate (folic acid), another important component of the B-vitamins, is important for a healthy pregnancy, reducing the risk of serious birth defects of the spine and brain, also known as neural tube defects. Easing folic acid into your eating plan is easy: the delicious way is by eating folate-rich foods. Since 1998, enriched bread, cereal, pasta, flour, crackers and rice have been fortified with folic acid. You probably already eat some foods that have folate because many fruits and vegetables  including oranges (a good source) and avocado (an excellent source) are sources of this vitamin.

Until solid foods are introduced preferably at about six months breast milk can be a complete source of nutrition for infants. However, three nutrients may warrant additional consideration. Ask your doctor for advice.    Iron.  Iron is important for the manufacture of hemoglobin, the part of red blood cells that carry oxygen throughout the body. Iron also is essential for your baby's brain development and growth.   Premature infants who breast-feed may need iron supplementation earlier. They had less time to build adequate iron reserves before birth.   Fluoride.  Your baby's teeth started to develop even before you could see them. Fluoride, a mineral often found in tap water, helps develop strong teeth and prevent cavities later.   Breast milk contains little fluoride even if the mother's drinking water is fluoridated. If your breast-fed infant takes supplemental formula made with fluoridated water at least 0.3 ppm (parts per million) of fluoride your baby may get enough fluoride. If your child is breast-fed only or drinks formula made with well water, distilled water, unfluoridated bottled water or city unfluoridated water, your doctor may advise a fluoride supplement starting at about six months. Breast-fed infants who take supplemental ready-to-use formula also may need a fluoride supplement; these formulas usually are prepared with water low in fluoride.   Vitamin D.  This vitamin helps your baby use calcium from breast milk (and infant formula) to help bones grow and develop. When it is exposed to sunlight, the body can make vitamin D but a baby's skin should be protected from sunlight with sunscreen or clothing.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Breast-feeding requires extra nutrition, making healthy eating just as important post-pregnancy. Women who are breast-feeding use about 500 calories daily to make the full amount of milk most babies need from birth to 6 months. Two-thirds of those calories should come from meals and snacks containing foods from all five food groups. The remaining calories come from the weight gained during pregnancy. While many women find breast-feeding helps them lose weight, weight loss varies among mothers depending on physical activity, the amount of weight gained during pregnancy and how much breast milk is produced.   A slow, gradual weight loss of 1 pound per week or 4 pounds per month is a safe goal for breast-feeding moms who want to return to their pre-pregnancy weight. Women who eat less than 1,800 calories per day may reduce the amount of milk their bodies make. Stress, anxiety and fatigue can also decrease milk production. Do yourself and your baby a favor  relax and sit down to eat three meals per day. Be sure to drink plenty of fluids and choose healthy snacks between meals. Moderate physical activity, such as walking, is also good for you and will not reduce milk volume.   Choosing the Right Foods   Eating right while breast-feeding is not complicated and it does not need to be bland. Mothers from many cultures breast-feed successfully on a diet of widely varied foods. Follow these guidelines to reach a healthy weight while keeping your baby well-nourished.     Eat a variety of foods from all five food groups. Visit  ChooseMyPlate.gov  to get a personalized eating plan for breast-feeding women.   For protein, choose lean meat, poultry, fish, beans, eggs, nuts and seeds. Eat no more than 12 ounces per week of fish and shellfish and no more than 6 ounces per week of albacore tuna. Avoid fish with high mercury levels, such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish.   Eat colorful fruits and vegetables. Fill half your plate with vegetables and fruit at lunch and dinner, and include fruit and vegetables in snacks. Whole fruit is better than juice, so limit juice to 1 cup per day and make sure its 100-percent juice.   Include three servings of low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt or cheese each day. If you dont think you can tolerate milk, try lactose-free milk or calcium-fortified soy milk.   Choose whole-wheat bread, brown rice and whole-wheat pasta more often than refined grains.   Use healthful oils, such as olive oil, canola, soybean and corn oil, but in small amounts since they can amount to extra calories.   Drink enough water and decaffeinated unsweetened beverages to quench your thirst. While you are breast-feeding, your need for fluids increases. Limit caffeine-containing beverages  including coffee, tea and soft drinks  to one or two 8-ounce cups a day.   Make smart food choices that are low in empty calories. Empty calories are found in foods high in added sugars and fats including soft drinks, desserts, fried foods and fatty meats.   Vitamin and mineral supplements cannot replace a healthy diet. Talk with your doctor before taking any vitamin or mineral supplements.   If you have special nutrition needs, consult a  registered dietitian nutritionist  for a customized eating plan.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    While pregnancy is not the time to lose weight, women should not use their expanding bellies as a reason to eat more than is necessary. The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including her body mass index, or BMI, before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite. All pregnant women should eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods each day. It may also be necessary to take a vitamin and mineral supplement if recommended by a physician.   Many women start off pregnancy with an overweight or obese BMI and many gain more weight than is healthy during their pregnancy. Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy is risky for both mother and child, with some risks including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension (high blood pressure), Cesarean delivery, birth defects and even fetal death. If a women is obese during pregnancy, it also raises the chance her child will be obese later in life.   Weight Gain Guidelines   The latest weight gain guidelines by the Institute of Medicine are based on a women's BMI before pregnancy. ( See Understanding Body Mass Index (BMI) .) The amount of weight gained depends on which category the pre-pregnancy BMI lands in:     Underweight:  BMI below 18.5   Normal weight:  18.5 to 24.9   Overweight:  25.0 to 29.9   Obese:  30.0 and above     The weight ranges below are for a full-term pregnancy:     Underweight:  28 to 40 pounds   Normal:  25 to 35 pounds   Overweight:  15 to 25 pounds   Obese:  11 to 20 pounds     For twins, the recommendations naturally go up:     Normal:  37 to 54 pounds   Overweight:  31 to 50 pounds   Obese:  25 to 42 pounds     There are no set guidelines for underweight BMI weight gain with twins.   Calorie Intake   In general, pregnant women need between 2,200 calories and 2,900 calories a day. A gradual increase in calories as the baby grows is the best bet. Here is an overview of how calorie needs change during each trimester:     The first trimester does not require any extra calories.   During the second trimester, an additional 340 calories a day are recommended.   For the third trimester, the recommendation is 450 calories more a day than when not pregnant.     Additional calories should come from nutrient-dense foods including lean protein, whole grains, dairy, vegetables and fruit. Avoid unneeded extra calories by cutting down on foods high in fat and added sugars such as regular soda, sweets and fried foods.   Physical Activity   Physical activity can help manage weight gain. The activity guidelines for pregnant women are 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days of the week. Make sure to talk with a doctor before starting or continuing any exercise routine while pregnant.         Reviewed January 2017         Tags     Health   Pregnancy   Prenatal Wellness   For Women"

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    The 40 (or so) weeks of pregnancy are a magical time. Keeping a healthy lifestyle throughout pregnancy, as well as before and after, is key for both baby and mother. Important steps to a healthy pregnancy include eating a balanced diet; gaining the right amount of weight; enjoying regular physical activity; taking a vitamin and mineral supplement if recommended by a physician; and avoiding alcohol, tobacco and other harmful substances.   Foods Fit for Mom and Baby     Moms-to-be need a variety of foods from all the  MyPlate  food groups. A balanced diet with a variety of foods can provide healthy women with enough nutrients for pregnancy. Safe food practices are important, too,  since pregnant women are at higher risk of food poisoning .   Pregnant women need a balanced diet including:     Whole grains:  Breads, cereals, pastas and brown rice.   Fruits:  All types of fruits, fresh, frozen or canned without added sugars.   Vegetables:  Eat a variety of colorful vegetables, fresh, frozen or canned with no added salt. Raw sprouts should be avoided.   Lean protein:  Choose lean protein from meat, poultry, fish, eggs, beans and peas, peanut butter, soy products and nuts. Pregnant women should avoid eating tilefish, shark, swordfish and king mackerel, and limit white (albacore) tuna to 6 ounces per week. Deli, luncheon meats and hot dogs should be reheated if consumed.   Low-fat or fat-free dairy:  This includes milk, cheese and yogurt. Unpasteurized milk and some soft cheeses that are made from unpasteurized milk also should be avoided.   Healthful fats:  From foods such as avocados, nuts and seeds as well as vegetable oils including canola and olive oil.     Avoid extra calories from added sugars and solid fats, which can lead to  unhealthy weight gain . Cut down on foods such as regular soda, sweets and fried snacks.   Key Nutrients for Healthy Pregnancy     Folic Acid:  Folic acid reduces the risk of birth defects that affect the spinal cord. All women of childbearing age and pregnant women should consume at least 400 micrograms of folic acid each day. Natural food sources of folate include legumes, green leafy vegetables and citrus fruits. Folate also can be obtained through fortified foods such as cereals, pastas and bread as well as supplements.   Iron:  Maternal iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency during pregnancy. Pregnant women need at least 27 milligrams of iron each day. Foods with high and moderate amounts of iron include red meat, chicken and fish, fortified cereals, spinach, some leafy greens and beans. For vegetarians and women who do not eat a lot of meat, increase iron absorption by combining plant-based sources of iron with vitamin C-rich foods. For example, try spinach salad with mandarin oranges or cereal with strawberries.   Calcium:  During pregnancy, calcium is needed for the healthy development of a baby's teeth, bones, heart, nerves and muscles. When a pregnant woman does not consume enough calcium, it is taken from her bones for the baby. It is important to consume adequate amounts of calcium daily before, during and after pregnancy. The recommended amount of calcium during pregnancy is 1,300 milligrams per day for adolescents 14 to 18 years old and 1,000 milligrams per day for women aged 19 to 50. That means at least three daily servings of calcium-rich foods such as low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt or cheese or calcium-fortified plant-based beverages, cereals and juices.     Your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist may recommend a prenatal vitamin/mineral supplement to help ensure that you get enough iron, folic acid and other nutrients.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) agree: Well-planned vegetarian and vegan eating patterns are healthy for infants and toddlers.   Time and attention are necessary to help young children, vegetarian or not, get all the nutrients they need for normal growth and development.   For the first six months, all babies do best with breast milk. Use iron-fortified formula (soy for vegans) if breast-feeding is decreased or stopped. Cow's milk, soy milk, rice milk and homemade formulas are not appropriate for babies during the first year because they have the wrong ratio of protein, fat and carbohydrate. They are also missing important nutrients for health, growth and development.   Solid foods can be introduced in the same way as for non-vegetarian infants. Replace meat with mashed or pureed tofu or beans and soy or dairy yogurt and cheese. (See  Introducing Solid Foods .)   Since breast milk is such a rich source of nutrients, vegan mothers may want to breast-feed for more than one year. Wean vegan infants with soy milk fortified with calcium and vitamins B12 and D. Milk alternatives, such as soy, rice, almond, hemp, etc., are not recommended during the first year of life as a primary drink because it is low in both protein and energy.   Nutrients Needing Special Attention   When feeding vegetarian or vegan children, pay close attention to the following nutrients:     Vitamin B12:  Vegetarians can get plenty of B12 from milk products and eggs. Vegans, both breast-feeding moms and children, need a good source of B12. Options include a supplement or fortified foods such as soy beverages, cereals and meat substitutes.   Vitamin D:  The AAP recommends all breast-fed infants receive 400 IU per day of supplemental vitamin D starting shortly after birth. This should continue until your child consumes the same amount of vitamin D from fortified milk: at least one quart per day of cow or soy milk.   Calcium:  Breast- and formula-fed babies, as well as toddlers who consume milk and dairy foods, usually get plenty of additional calcium from foods including yogurt and cheese. For vegan toddlers, calcium-fortified foods and beverages or supplements may be necessary. See a registered dietitian nutritionist for advice.   Iron:  The iron content of breast milk is low, even if moms are eating well. Babies are born with enough iron for 4 to 6 months. After this age, vegetarian and vegan infants need an outside source. Options include iron-fortified cereals or supplements.   Protein:  Babies need plenty of protein for rapid growth during the first year. Protein needs can be met with breast milk or formula until about 8 months. After that, add plant proteins from beans and cereals and fortified soy milks. Lacto-ovo toddlers can get protein from yogurt and eggs.   Fiber:  Lots of fiber can fill toddlers up quickly. Provide frequent meals and snacks. Use some refined grains, such as fortified cereals, breads and pasta, and higher-fat plant foods including sunflower butter and avocados to help vegetarian children meet their energy and nutrient needs.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    A balanced diet is a cornerstone of health. Women, like men, should enjoy a variety of foods, such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, healthy fats, low-fat dairy and lean protein. But women also have special nutrient needs, and, during each stage of a woman's life, these needs change.   Eating Right   Nutrient-rich foods provide energy for women's busy lives and help to prevent disease. A healthy daily diet includes:     At least three 1-ounce servings of whole grains such as whole-grain bread, cereal, pasta, brown rice or oats.   Three servings of low-fat or fat-free dairy products including low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt or cheese.   Five to 6 ounces of protein such as lean meat, chicken, turkey, fish, eggs, beans or peas and nuts.   Two cups of fruits  fresh, frozen or canned without added sugar.   Two-and-a-half cups of colorful vegetables  fresh, frozen or canned without added salt.      Iron-rich Foods   Iron is one of the keys to good health and energy levels in women. Iron-rich food sources include red meat, chicken, turkey, pork, fish, kale, spinach, beans, lentils and fortified breads and cereals. Plant-based sources of iron are more easily absorbed by your body when eaten with vitamin C-rich foods. So eat fortified cereal with strawberries on top, spinach salad with mandarin orange slices or add tomatoes to lentil soup.   Folic Acid During the Reproductive Years   When women reach childbearing age, they need to eat enough folic acid to decrease risk of birth defects. The requirement is at least 400 micrograms of folic acid a day. Be sure to consume adequate amounts of folic acid daily from fortified foods or supplements, in addition to food forms of folate from a varied diet. Citrus fruits, leafy greens, beans and peas naturally contain folate. There are many folic acid fortified foods such as cereals, rice and breads.   Daily Calcium Requirements   For healthy bones and teeth, women need to eat a variety of calcium-rich foods every day. Calcium keeps bones strong and prevents osteoporosis, a bone disease in which the bones become weak and break easily. Some calcium-rich foods include low-fat or fat-free milk, yogurt and cheese, sardines, tofu (if made with calcium sulfate) and calcium-fortified foods including juices and cereals.   Foods to Limit   To keep weight in check at any age, women should avoid a lot of excess calories from added sugars, fat and alcohol.     Limit regular soft drinks, sugar-sweetened beverages, candy, baked goods and fried foods.   Limit alcohol intake to one drink per day. One drink is equal to 12 ounces of beer, 5 ounces of wine or 1.5 ounces of liquor.   Opt for low-fat dairy and meat products instead of their full-fat counterparts.     Eat fewer foods that are high in saturated fat  the kind found in fatty meats, sausages, cheese and full-fat dairy products, baked goods and pizza.   Balancing Calories with Activity   Since women typically have less muscle, more fat and are smaller than men, you need fewer calories to maintain a healthy body weight and activity level. Moderately active women need 1,800 to 2,200 calories a day. Women who are more physically active may require more calories.   Exercise is an important part of a woman's health. Regular daily activity helps with weight control, muscle strength and stress management.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Healthy weight management is all about energy balance. That means eating smarter and moving more. Unfortunately, when trying to lose weight, many busy people tend to limit some of the very foods they need the most. Here are some tasty ways to get the essential energizing nutrients your body craves and to cut back on unnecessary calories at the same time.   Carbohydrates   The biggest problem with low-carb diets is they restrict your body's preferred energy source. If you want to cut back on calories from carbohydrates, focus on reducing your intake of sugar-sweetened beverages such as soft drinks, candy and other foods with added sugars. To maximize your energy level and long-term health, look to nutrient-rich carbohydrate sources such as whole grains, fruits, vegetables, beans and peas.   Protein   One of the most satisfying ways to eat and control weight is to include lean protein in every meal. Try low-fat dairy foods, eggs, lean meats, poultry, seafood, nuts and beans. Protein may be especially helpful in the morning. Add some protein to breakfast and you'll probably be satisfied until lunchtime. Chances are you won't be as tempted by all those high-fat, sugary mid-morning snacks.   Iron   Low iron intakes can lead to serious problems such as iron-deficiency anemia, the most common nutrient deficiency for premenopausal women and children. To prevent anemia and fatigue, women between the ages of 19 and 50 should get 18 milligrams of iron per day. Pump up your intake with excellent iron sources, such as lean red meat and iron-fortified cereals. Other good sources include poultry, fish, beans and leafy green vegetables. When relying on plant foods for iron, consume a source of vitamin C, such a strawberries or tomatoes, with the iron-rich food to help your body absorb the iron.       Calcium   Calcium does a lot more than help build strong bones and teeth. Getting enough calcium helps keep your heart and muscles strong and may help prevent high blood pressure and colon cancer too. Those are plenty of reasons to enjoy high-calcium foods, such as low-fat dairy; calcium-set tofu; green leafy vegetables including kale, collard greens and broccoli; and calcium-fortified 100-percent fruit juice. Aim for at least 1,000 milligrams per day (more if you are younger than 18 or older than 50).   Folic Acid   Every woman of childbearing age needs 400 micrograms of folic acid every day. That's what it takes to reduce the risk of neural tube birth defects by 75 percent. Folic acid can also boost your immune function by producing disease-fighting white blood cells. Get your folic acid from tasty, nutrient-rich foods, such as whole grains, green leafy vegetables, oranges, berries, nuts, beans and enriched grain products.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Starting your baby on solid foods is exciting  and messy! Most babies start with a very small amount of solids at around 4 to 6 months old, slowly increasing their portion size. Then, at around 9 to 11 months old, you may start noticing a dramatic drop in how much breast milk or formula your baby drinks as he or she starts getting more nutrition and calories from solid foods.   Because of their changing dietary needs over this transition, it is important that infants get the nutrition they need to grow and develop.  For some children, this means filling nutritional gaps with carefully chosen supplements.     Iron   Babies are born with a store of iron that lasts them for about 4 to 6 months. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that full-term infants who are exclusively breast-fed be given an iron supplement starting at 4 months of age. Talk to your pediatrician to see if your infant needs an iron supplement. Children born premature or with a low birth weight may have reduced iron stores. If so, your pediatrician will probably recommend iron supplements until your baby's first birthday. Formula is generally iron-fortified, which means formula-fed babies rarely need an iron supplement.   As infants begin to eat more solid food, serving them iron-rich foods such as iron-fortified cereal, meat or beans at least twice a day will help them meet their iron needs. But, if your baby is over 6 months old, is breast-fed and is not eating iron-rich foods, your pediatrician may recommend an iron supplement.   To promote iron absorption from plant foods, combine iron-rich solid foods you serve to your child with vitamin C-rich foods in one meal. For example, pair a bean and rice puree or finger food meal with tomato sauce, fruit or a fruit puree.   Vitamin D   Vitamin D is important for healthy bones and prevention of chronic disease. Because low levels of vitamin D are so common, the American Academy of Pediatrics says all breast-fed infants  and formula-fed infants who drink less than 32 ounces of formula per day  should take a supplement. When starting solids, you can mix vitamin D drops in purees as well as add them to formula or water.   Fluoride   Before you determine if your baby needs fluoride, which is important for cavity prevention, you need to know levels of fluoride in your local water supply. Fluoride supplements are only available by prescription, so discuss this with your pediatrician.   Vitamin B 12   Vitamin B 12 , which prevents anemia and supports healthy neurological function, is found in animal products such as meat, fish, eggs and dairy, and is not a concern for most children. However, if you plan to introduce only plant-based foods into your child's diet, he or she may need a B 12  supplement. Formula-fed vegan babies can get their vitamin B 12  from a special fortified formula, most often soy-based. Vegan mothers who exclusively breast-feed should be sure to consume adequate vitamin B 12  through fortified foods and supplements in order to provide ample B 12  to her baby via breast milk.Vitamin B 12  is typically included in most over-the-counter infant vitamin drops and many ready-to-eat cereals and milk substitutes.   Before giving your infant any supplements, always consult with your pediatrician. Not all infants automatically need supplements when starting solids. Make sure to introduce your baby to a variety of foods in order to develop his or her palate and meet nutritional needs.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Young kids with healthy teeth have more than just beautiful smiles. Baby teeth help children speak and chew, while holding a place in the jaw for the permanent teeth that are still hiding under the gums. But, ""poor oral health [at any age] can impact general health,"" says Lisa Harper Mallonee, MPH, RD, LD, registered dietitian, registered dental hygienist and associate professor at Texas A&M Baylor College of Dentistry.    It's never too soon to start caring for your children's teeth. Before the first tooth even erupts, Malloonee says, ""You really should start swabbing the mouth after feedings with a soft cloth."" Beginning a few days after birth, wipe the gums with a soft baby washcloth to remove plaque that can cause decay in erupting teeth. Dental caries, or tooth decay, are little holes in the teeth caused by bacteria in the mouth, which thrive on the sugars in our diet and produce acids that attack the tooth. Dental caries are on the rise among children, especially between the ages of 2 and 11 years old. Fortunately, good oral hygiene and a healthy diet can prevent tooth and gum problems throughout life.   The Bad   ""Avoid putting babies to bed with a bottle,"" says Angela Lemond, RDN, CSP, LD, spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""It's common for babies and toddlers to fall asleep while drinking."" When this happens, breast milk or formula sits on teeth and gums for long periods, providing an environment that tooth-decay-causing bacteria love.   As children get older and start eating a greater variety of foods, it's important to pay attention to their consumption of sweets and sticky foods, Lemond says. Frequently eating the following foods increases the risk of developing dental caries:     Sugar-sweetened beverages such as sodas, fruit drinks, sports and energy drinks, and sweetened teas and coffee, especially if sipped over a long period of time   Sticky foods like caramels, raisins and dried apricots, particularly when eaten alone   Lollipops and other hard candies that dissolve slowly   Desserts like cookies, cakes and brownies   Sugar, including brown sugar, honey, molasses and agave nectar     Grazing or snacking frequently throughout the day also increases the risk of caries. The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics suggests that you allow at least two hours between snacks and meals.    The Good   Eating fresh fruits and vegetables helps protect teeth by stimulating the production of saliva, which cleanses the mouth and and makes it less acidic. Chewing sugar-free gum for 20 minutes after meals and snacks also can help prevent tooth decay.   Drinking water with food  and after a meal  helps eliminate bacteria and reduce acid production. And, if your water is fluoridated, you and your family are getting extra protection. ""Fluoride is a mineral that helps resist tooth decay by decreasing acid levels in the mouth and even aiding in the repair process of early decay,"" Lemond says.   Approximately three-quarters of Americans receive fluoridated water through their community water system, but some bottled waters dont contain fluoride, she says. If youre not consuming water with fluoride, talk to your dentist about other ways to get it, including topical fluoride treatments at your dentists office.   A good diet is critical for the health of the mouth and staying healthy, but it wont make up for poor dental hygiene. Continue to see your dentist for checkups and cleanings, and make sure to brush and floss regularly.         Jill Weisenberger, MS, RDN, CDE, FAND, is a nutrition writer based in Virginia.

5 Common Food-Drug Interactions

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    You've probably heard the warnings not to drink grapefruit juice with cholesterol medication. However, that isn't the only combination of food and drugs to avoid. Grapefruit juice can interact with numerous other medications, both prescription and over-the-counter. And many other foods commonly interact with drugs, too.   Steve Plogsted, BS, PharmD, BCNSP, CNSC, clinical pharmacist with Nutrition Support Service of Nationwide Children's Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, fills us in on five foods that most commonly interact with medications.   Grapefruit Juice   ""Grapefruit juice has the ability to interact with medications in various ways,"" says Plogsted. One way is by increasing the absorption of certain drugs  as is the case with some, but not all, cholesterol-lowering statins. MedinePlus recommends avoiding grapefruit juice if you are taking statins.   Grapefruit juice can also cause the body to metabolize drugs abnormally, resulting in lower or higher than normal blood levels of the drug. Many medications are affected in this way, including antihistamines, blood pressure drugs, thyroid replacement drugs, birth control, stomach acid-blocking drugs, and the cough suppressant dextromethorphan. It's best to avoid or significantly reduce intake of grapefruit juice when taking these medications.   But why is grapefruit juice of concern and not other citrus juices? According to Plogsted, grapefruit juice contains a class of compounds called furanocoumarins, which act in the body to alter the characteristics of these medications. Orange juice and other citrus juices do not contain these compounds. There is some concern for Seville oranges and the pummelo, which are relatives of the grapefruit.   Green Leafy Vegetables   Blood-thinning drugs such as Coumadin   (warfarin) interfere with vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Eating too much green leafy vegetables, which are high in vitamin K, can decrease the ability of blood-thinners to prevent clotting. But you don't have to give up greens altogether. Problems arise from significantly and suddenly increasing or decreasing intake, as it can alter the effectiveness of the medicine. So eat your greens in consistent amounts.   Natural Black Licorice (Glycyrrhiza)   According to Plogsted, glycyrrhiza  a natural ingredient used to make black licorice  can deplete the body of potassium while causing an increased retention of sodium. When the body is depleted of potassium, the activity of digoxin, a medication used to treat heart failure, can be greatly enhanced, resulting in the heart not beating properly.   Glycyrrhiza can also decrease the effectiveness of high blood pressure medicines. And people taking Coumadin   (warfarin) should beware that glycyrrhiza can break down the drug, resulting in an increase in the body's clotting mechanism.   Excessive amounts of natural licorice should be avoided when taking all of these medications. However, Plogsted notes that artificially-flavored black licorice doesn't contain glycyrrhiza and is not of concern.   Salt Substitutes   Consumers taking digoxin for heart failure or ACE inhibitors for high blood pressure should be careful with salt substitutes, which most often replace sodium with potassium. With an increased consumption of potassium, the effectiveness of digoxin can be decreased, resulting in heart failure. And those taking ACE inhibitors might see a significant increase in blood potassium levels, as these drugs are known to increase potassium.   ""There is no real need to avoid salt substitutes, although care should be taken when using the product,"" say Plogsted. ""If the consumer has decreased kidney function they should discuss the use of salt substitutes with their doctor.""   Tyramine-Containing Foods   High blood levels of the amino acid tyramine can cause an increase in blood pressure. Several medications interfere with the breakdown of tyramine, including monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) which treat depression, and drugs used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's disease. Plogsted advises those taking these drugs to steer clear of tyramine-rich foods. The list is lengthy and includes, but is not limited to: chocolate, aged and mature cheeses, smoked and aged/fermented meats, hot dogs, some processed lunch meats, fermented soy products and draft beers (canned and bottled beers are OK).   When receiving a prescription for a new medication or taking a new over-the-counter drug, Plogsted advises consumers to always read drug warning labels and ask their physician and/or pharmacist about which foods or other drugs they should avoid or be concerned about taking.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Vitamins do not provide energy, but they are crucial for turning food into energy. Although some research suggests the high activity levels of athletes may increase their vitamin needs, at present, the Institute of Medicine does not make vitamin recommendations specific to athletes. While vitamins will not enhance your performance, a shortage is sure to get you down.   Here's a view of the role vitamins play, as well as their Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI).   Vitamin B1 (Thiamine)   Thiamine helps break down carbohydrates and proteins for energy. However, taking more than the DRI does not appear to enhance performance.     DRI: 1.2mg (men), 1.1mg (women)   Good sources: Whole and enriched grains and fortified cereals     Vitamin B2 (Riboflavin)   Riboflavin is integral to energy production. It also plays a role in red blood cell formation. Athletes need the DRI of this vitamin.     DRI: 1.3mg (men), 1.1mg (women)   Good sources: Almonds, milk, yogurt, wheat germ, fortified breads and cereals     Niacin   Niacin supports both anaerobic and aerobic performance. Too much or too little niacin can shift your body's use of energy from fat to carbohydrates or vice versa; this might affect performance.     DRI: 16mg (men), 14mg (women)   Good sources: Meat, fish, poultry, peanuts, peanut butter and enriched grain products     Vitamin B6   Vitamin B6 is involved in over 100 metabolic reactions in your body, including the production of energy and hemoglobin, a protein in red blood cells. Intakes below the DRI can hurt performance.     DRI: 1.3mg (31-50 years old), 1.7mg (men 51 years and over), 1.5mg (women 51 years and over)   Good sources: Meat, fish, poultry, eggs, beans whole grains, seeds and oysters     Vitamin B12   Because of its role in red blood cell formation, B12 is crucial for getting oxygen to tissues. B12 is only found in animal products, putting vegan and vegetarian athletes at risk for anemia. Such groups should try to get as much B12 from food as possible. Taking a B12 supplement or eating B12-fortified foods also may be needed.     DRI: 2.4mcg   Good sources: Seafood, meats, milk and cheese, eggs and fortified breakfast cereals     Folate   Folate is important for cell production, heart health and protection against birth defects. The DRI appears to be enough to support the energy demands of athletes. Female athletes of childbearing age should include folate in their diet every day.     DRI: 400mcg   Good sources: Enriched grains, dark leafy greens, whole-grain breads and cereals and citrus fruits     Vitamin C   Perhaps the most famous antioxidant, vitamin C offers a wide variety of health benefits, including protecting from infection and damage to body cells, helping produce collagen (the connective tissue that holds bones and muscles together), protecting your body from bruising by keeping capillary walls and blood vessels firm, and helping in the absorption of iron and folate.     DRI: 90mg (men), 75mg (women)   Good sources: citrus fruits (oranges, grapefruits and tangerines), strawberries, sweet peppers, tomatoes, broccoli and potatoes     Pantothenic Acid   This vitamin is needed for the breakdown of fats, proteins and carbohydrates into usable energy. It is found in almost all plant and animal foods. Athletes should aim to meet the adequate intake for pantothenic acid.     DRI: 5mg   Good sources: Poultry, seafood, nuts, seeds, avocados and whole grains     Biotin   Biotin plays an important role in energy production.     DRI: 30mcg   Good sources: Nuts, eggs, soybeans and fish     Vitamin D   Vitamin D is actually a hormone, not a vitamin. Your body can make its own vitamin D with enough sun exposure. Vitamin D is important for bone health; athletes in weight-sensitive sports  such as gymnastics, running or cycling  should take care to get enough. A physician may suggest vitamin D and/or calcium supplements for some athletes.     DRI: 600IU (1-70 years old), 800IU (71 years and over)   Good sources: Fortified milk and cereals, cod-liver oil, seafood and eggs           Reviewed September 2014         Tags     Food   Fitness   Vitamins and Supplements   Sports and Performance   Types of Vitamins and Nutrients   Dietary Supplements   Tips for Athletes"

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Most of us know that good nutrition and a balanced diet are important for good health. However, when we hear buzzwords such as ""calcium deficiency"" or learn that a new multivitamin just hit the shelves, it can make us wonder if the food we're eating is enough. Hint: It likely is.   Taking a daily dose of any of the single minerals, vitamins or multivitamin/mineral supplements that line the shelves of supermarkets and drug stores can be tempting. According to the 2015  Dietary Guidelines for Americans , ""Nutritional needs should be met primarily from foods. Individuals should aim to meet their nutrient needs through healthy eating patterns that include nutrient-dense foods ... [which] contain essential vitamins and minerals and also dietary fiber and other naturally occurring substances that may have positive health effects.""  While there may be a need to supplement our diet at certain times in our lives, the safety of taking a supplement also needs to be considered.    Too much of some vitamins and minerals can cause health issues; and, therefore, recommended levels should not be exceeded.   Who needs supplements?   As it turns out, the best way to be and stay healthy is to choose a wide variety of nutritious foods from all five  MyPlate  food groups. Nutrient deficiencies are not common among Americans, but for varying reasons some people cannot reach the recommended nutrient amounts without using supplements and/or including fortified foods. In addition to a healthy and balanced diet, those individuals may need nutrient supplements depending on their situation. For example, older adults, pregnant women and people who are food insecure are at increased risk of nutrient deficiencies.   In addition, if you are eating less than 1,600 calories each day because you are trying to lose weight, you have a poor appetite or you have trouble eating because you have been using alcohol or drugs, discuss the need for supplements with your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist.   Some individuals are limited in their food choices due to allergies, a medical condition or because they are following a vegetarian or vegan diet. For example, animal foods are the main source of vitamin B12, so people who follow a vegan diet need to eat fortified foods and/or take a supplement.   Women who are at an age where they could become pregnant need to obtain adequate folic acid from fortified foods (cereals and other grains), supplements or both, in addition to consuming folate from foods in a varied diet. Because it helps reduce the risk of some birth defects, folic acid is very important during childbearing years. If lab tests show that a woman's iron status is low during pregnancy, her health-care provider will recommend an iron supplement.   Vitamin D might be a concern among infants, children and young adults. Infants who are breast-fed and children who consume less than the recommended amount of vitamin D fortified milk or formula and those with increased risk of deficiency will likely need supplemental vitamin D. Adolescent girls, meanwhile, might need additional iron.   On the other side of the spectrum, as people age it can be difficult to get enough vitamins B12 and D. Luckily, this is one of the cases where supplements can make a difference. Getting B12 from fortified foods or taking it alone or as part of a multivitamin mineral can help raise B12 in your blood. If you're taking calcium or a multivitamin, try to pick one up that also has vitamin D.   Other groups who may require additional supplementation include people who are taking certain medications or have a health condition that changes how their body uses nutrients, and individuals who have been told by their doctor they have a specific nutrient deficiency.   Your doctor can order tests to help determine if taking a supplement would benefit you. The results might show that you are low in a certain nutrient or you might discover that you're doing just fine. Additionally, review your current diet. An RDN can help you evaluate the foods you eat and make recommendations that meet your personal needs.   Remember, real food contains healthy things a pill can't give us. When we take a nutrient out of a food and concentrate it in a pill, it's not quite the same thing. Be sure to consider your individual situation and consult a doctor or an RDN before considering supplements.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Good dental care begins at birth even before baby teeth appear! Healthy teeth let children chew food easier, learn to talk clearly, and smile with self-assurance.       Make cleaning your baby's teeth and gums part of the daily bathtub routine. Starting at birth, clean your baby's gums with a soft infant toothbrush and water, or use a clean, wet washcloth or gauze pad. Do this after every feeding. Skip toothpaste, which babies often swallow.   Schedule your baby's first visit to a pediatric dentist after the first tooth appears (at about six to 12 months).   Fluoride is a mineral that helps teeth develop and resist decay. In many places, fluoride is naturally present in local water supplies at various levels. If you live in an area that doesn't have fluoridated water, ask your baby's doctor if your baby or child needs a fluoride supplement. Unless your child's dentist advises otherwise, wait until after age two or three years to start with fluoridated toothpaste.    To avoid tooth decay, do not put your infant, toddler, or young child to bed with a bottle of juice, formula, or milk. The liquid that bathes the teeth and gums from sucking on the bottle stays on teeth and can cause tooth decay. That happens even if a baby's teeth haven't yet erupted through the gums. If your child won't nap or go to bed without a bottle, fill it with plain water instead.

How to Create a PKU-Friendly Diet

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Phenylketonuria, or PKU, is a genetically inherited birth defect that causes an unwanted buildup of the amino acid phenylalanine in the blood. This buildup occurs because the enzyme that routinely converts one amino acid, phenylalanine, to another amino acid, tyrosine, is absent or deficient. Phenylalanine then accumulates in the blood and is toxic to brain tissue.    PKU at Birth   Babies born in the United States are screened for PKU with a blood test so treatment can begin immediately and prevent the adverse side effects of the condition, such as declining intelligence, neurological deterioration, stunted growth, hyperactivity and seizures. A treatment team typically consists of a metabolic dietitian, physician, geneticist and psychologist as an infant is monitored during different phases of growth and development in childhood to an adult.   A strict diet limited in phenylalanine is the main treatment for PKU. Phenylalanine is found in most protein-containing foods such as milk, eggs, cheese, nuts, soybeans, chicken, beef, pork, beans and fish. ""An infant will have to consume a special phenylalanine-free formula for the first year of life,"" says Sarah Krieger, MPH, RDN, LDN, former pokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. However, some breast milk can be used in limited amounts.   Creating an Unique Meal Plan   As the infant grows and becomes developmentally ready for solid foods, a registered dietitian nutritionist with expertise in PKU will create a unique menu for the child. ""The metabolic dietitian can create meal plans with modified food sources of protein low in phenylalanine and high in tyrosine, while providing adequate calories, vitamins and minerals to support growth,"" says Krieger. Because so many foods are off limits with PKU, the meal plans include special formulas which are often the primary source of calories and essential nutrients. Special phenylalanine-free foods are available for children and teens with PKU. The metabolic dietitian will create individual eating plans and modify them as needed to promote healthy growth and development.    The diet needs to be followed for life. ""The individual with PKU will require blood monitoring to maintain serum phenylalanine levels,"" says Kreiger. In conjunction with blood monitoring, the metabolic dietitian will regularly review diet records or food journals and growth charts, making adjustments to the eating plan as needed.    Parents of children with PKU need to be creative with foods and use available PKU cookbooks. Get help with menu planning from the metabolic dietitian and plan ahead for eating out, school lunches, potlucks, trips and vacations, and other special events. Try to center special occasions around activities rather than food, and encourage your child to be part of the management of his or her diet as early as possible. ""A skilled dietitian, physician and psychologist team can address social issues with each stage of life,"" says Kreiger. ""Knowledge is power and the more parents, and eventually the child, know how to live with PKU, then a healthy, productive life is possible.""

The Inside Scoop on Artificial Sweeteners

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    If you're concerned about the amount of sugar in your child's diet you might be wondering if artificial sweeteners are a smart alternative. ""The safety of artificial sweeteners has been studied for years and, used in moderation, they are perfectly safe for kids,"" says Sarah Krieger, MPH, RD, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. ""Unlike sugar, they dont cause cavities or add calories to food and they can be a helpful alternative for children with diabetes.""    Despite what you may have heard, artificial sweeteners like aspartame, saccharine, neotame, acesulfame-K and sucralose dont cause birth defects or cancer and they arent linked to behavior problems. Because they are hundreds of times sweeter than sugar, only tiny amounts are needed to equal the sweetening power of sugar. Before the government approves the use of any sweetener it carefully scrutinizes:     How it is made   Which foods it will be used in   How much the average person will eat each day   If it is potentially harmful to a person's health     It then sets a limit for the amount that a person can safely consume based on their body weight. That limit is usually many times more than the average child will ever eat. For example, a 40-pound child would need to eat 24 packets of aspartame or drinkfour 12-ounce cans of diet soda every day to reach this level.   That said, there is one group of kids who cant eat all artificial sweeteners: those with phenylketonuria (or PKU). People with PKU aren't able to metabolize phenylalanine, an amino acid in aspartame, so they're advised to steer clear of aspartame.    If your child is eating the occasional artificially sweetened food you have nothing to worry about. But, before you stock your fridge with artificially sweetened foods and drinks, rememberthat many of these  such as sugar free ice cream and fruit flavored drinks aren't always the most nutritious choices and can still fill kids up with empty calories. ""Instead satisfy your child's sweet tooth naturally by mixing fresh berries into creamy low-fat yogurt, slicing bananas on a whole grain waffle, or stirring chopped pears into a steaming bowl of oatmeal,"" says Krieger.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    A mother's food and nutrition choices before and during pregnancy can greatly contribute to the future health of her children. Women living a healthy lifestyle deliver children with fewer birth defects and chronic health problems. So what makes a lifestyle ""healthy?"" For pregnant women, key habits include eating a variety of foods, ensuring adequate intake of vitamins and minerals, gaining an appropriate amount of weight, participating in regular physical activity and avoiding harmful substances.   Once the baby has arrived, it is important that newborns receive optimal nutrition from the beginning. Studies have shown that breast-feeding provides many advantages to both baby and mother  in terms of health benefits and financial savings. In addition to eating right from birth, developing physical activity habits at an early ageis also important. Active young children are better prepared for life than those who spend childhood sedentary in front of a television or video game screen.   Eating Right during Pregnancy   Moms-to-be need a variety of foods from all the  MyPlate  food groups to get the nutrition needed for a healthy pregnancy. Pregnant women need a balanced diet including whole grains, fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, low-fat dairy and healthful fats. A prenatal multivitamin/mineral supplement may be recommended by your doctor or registered dietitian nutritionist to ensure that you get enough iron, folic acid and other nutrients. Safe food practices are important, too, since pregnant women are at higher risk of food poisoning.   Healthy Weight Gain during Pregnancy   While pregnancy is not the time to lose weight, women should not use their expanding bellies as an excuse to eat more than is necessary. The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including body mass index (BMI) before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite.   Many women start off pregnancy overweight or obese; many gain more weight than is healthy during their pregnancy. Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy is risky for both mother and child.   Breast-feeding Benefits   For optimal nutrition for your infant, the Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticsrecommends exclusively breast-feeding for the first six months to provide optimal nutrition and health protection, and continuing breast-feeding with the addition of complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12 months of age.   In addition to providing the best nutrition, breast-feeding reduces your baby's risk of ear infections, respiratory illnesses, gastrointestinal infections and possibly sudden infant death syndrome and obesity. Breast-feeding also provides mom with benefits including aiding in weight loss after delivery and reducing risk of breast and ovarian cancers.

While couples can't control all of the causes of infertility, they  can  control their eating habits. And, nutrition and a healthy body weight for both partners can have a significant impact on the ability to conceive.   Women and Fertility   To prepare for pregnancy and enhance fertility, maintain a healthy weight and choose foods that will create a safe and supportive home for your baby's nine-month stay.   Men and Fertility   Men also should try to maintain a healthy body weight and follow a balanced eating pattern, since male obesity may alter testosterone and other hormone levels, according to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Plus, low sperm count and poor sperm motility are common in overweight and obese men. When it comes to diet, load up on fruits and vegetables, which contain vitamins, minerals and antioxidants that may help create strong sperm.  Read more about fertility and men's diets .   Find Your Healthy Weight   Increase your chance of getting pregnant by achieving and maintaining a healthy weight. The National Infertility Association reports that 30 percent of infertility cases are due to weight extremes, which can alter hormone levels and throw ovulation off schedule. For women who are overweight, as little as 5 percent weight loss could improve fertility. On the other hand, women who are underweight, with a body mass index below 18.5 (18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal), may experience irregular menstrual cycles or stop ovulating altogether, according to the American Society of Reproductive Medicine. Those who regularly participate in high-intensity exercise  such as gymnastics or dancing, have an eating disorder or follow restricted diets  often are at an increased risk.    Avoid going on fad diets, which can deplete your body of nutrients it needs for pregnancy and find a healthy eating plan that works for you by talking to a registered dietitian nutritionist.   Choose Iron-Rich Foods   An diet rich in iron that comes from vegetables and supplements may lower the risk of ovulatory infertility, according to results from The Nurses' Health Study II, which followed 18,500 female nurses trying to get pregnant. Ovulatory infertility is only one cause of infertility and affects 25 percent of infertile couples.   Vegetarian foods with iron include all types of beans, eggs, lentils, spinach, fortified cereals, long-grain enriched rice and whole grains. Add vitamin C from citrus fruits, bell peppers or berries to your meals to enhance iron absorption.   The ""Fertility Diet""   Published by a team of Harvard researchers in 2007, the ""Fertility Diet"" study  with a book released in 2009 of the same name  found women with ovulatory infertility who followed this eating plan had a 66 percent lower risk of ovulatory infertility and a 27 percent reduced risk of infertility from other causes than women who didn't follow the diet closely.   Women following the ""fertility diet"" chose:     Less  trans  fat and more monounsaturated fat (from foods such as avocados and olive oil)   Less animal protein and more vegetable protein   More high-fiber, low-glycemic carbohydrate-rich foods (including whole grains)   More vegetarian sources of iron and fewer meat sources   Multivitamins   High-fat dairy instead of low-fat dairy     In general, eating more vegetables, eating healthy monounsaturated fats instead of saturated and  trans  fats, making at least half your grains whole, and getting enough calcium-rich foods  including dairy  will help you meet nutrient needs and promote a healthy weight.   Don't Forget Folic Acid   While it won't make you more fertile, it is crucial that women trying to conceive obtain 400 micrograms per day of folic acid from supplements (if considering taking any supplements, including folic acid, talk to your health care provider first) or foods such as dark leafy green vegetables and fortified grains. Folic acid is needed to prevent neural tube defects. The neural tube develops into the brain and spine three to four weeks after conception, before most women even realize they're pregnant.

Eating more whole-grain foods, fruits, vegetables, lean meats and low-fat or fat-free milk, cheese or yogurt can help lower your blood sugar, improve your bodys use of insulin and normalize hormone levels.   A healthy eating plan for women with PCOS includes:      Four to five meals or snacksevery day, including breakfast. Dont skip meals.   A variety of foods from all the MyPlate food groups: fruits, vegetables, grains, lean protein and low-fat dairy. Moderate portions of healthy fats, like olive and canola oils, walnuts, almonds and avocados.   Protein in all meals and snacks.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    It's no secret breast-feeding is best for baby and best for mom. In fact, the Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticsrecommends exclusively breast-feeding for the first six months to provide optimal nutrition and health protection, and breast-feeding with the addition of complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12 months of age.   Breast milk's unique antibodies, or disease-fighting cells, help protect infants from numerous illnesses and diseases. And, breast-feeding also helps reduce a nursing mother's risk of diabetes, postpartum depression and breast and ovarian cancers.   Breast-feeding has both environmental and economic benefits, since it eliminates the costs and wastes associated with formula production and plastic bottles. Depending on the formula brand, breast-feeding can save your family $1,000 to $4,000 per year.   While breast-feeding is the most natural way to feed a baby, new moms need information and support to be successful. Here are seven steps for breast-feeding success.   Before Your Baby Arrives   The third trimester of pregnancy is a great time to learn about breast-feeding, so you can be informed and confident when the baby comes.      Take a Breast-feeding Class   Check for availability at your hospital, doctor's office or WIC clinic. Learn about community resources, such as certified lactation consultants, so you'll know who to call with questions or concerns.    Read and Research   Check out books and pamphlets from the clinic, hospital or library. The more you know, the more relaxed you'll be in your new role as a breast-feeding mom.   Tell Everyone Your Plans to Breast-feed   Let your family, friends, doctor, hospital nurses, pediatrician and employer know you plan to give only breast milk to your baby and you'll need their support.     At the Hospital   Healthy newborns know how to find the breast and how to suckle. They just need plenty of snuggle time with mom to practice and for mom to build up a good milk supply.     ""Room in"" and Feed Frequently   Having your baby by your side allows you to respond to baby's hunger cues immediately. The more milk your baby removes from the breasts, the more milk you will make. Formula feeding will disrupt this natural process.   Ask for Help   Most hospitals have a lactation specialist who can help you find solutions if you're experiencing difficulties with early breast-feeding.     During the First Year and Beyond   Your breasts will easily make enough milk in response to your baby's growing needs. Most infants will need several feedings through the day and night, especially during the first weeks and growth spurts. Allow your baby to develop his or her own feeding schedule.     Take Care of Yourself   Breast-feeding moms need plenty of nutrient-rich foods and fluids to maintain their stamina while producing milk. Make sure to get enough rest. Many moms take a nap while their babies sleep.   Don't Be Afraid to Seek Help   If you need help figuring how to breast-feed while working or going to school, or if you have an infant with special needs, check with your pediatrician, lactation specialist or a registered dietitian nutritionist.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Does being pregnant mean saying goodbye to softball, tennis or any other sport you enjoy? Not necessarily.   Being physically active during pregnancy offers women many health benefits, among them a psychological lift, optimal weight gain and better aerobic fitness. For most pregnancies, mild to moderate physical activity benefits mom and won't affect your unborn child. Consider these benefits to staying active during pregnancy. You can:     Look and feel good as your body changes.   Promote muscle tone, stamina and strength.   Reduce leg and back pain, constipation, swelling and bloating.   Promote blood circulation and possibly help prevent varicose veins.   Help your posture and balance, which is very important as your center of gravity shifts.   Sleep better.   Prepare your body for labor and childbirth.   Get your body back in shape after delivery.     From  2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans : Pregnant and Postpartum Women   Healthy women who are not already doing vigorous-intensity physical activity should get at least 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Preferably, this activity should be spread throughout the week. Women who regularly engage in vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or high amounts of activity can continue their activity provided that their condition remains unchanged and they talk to their health care provider about their activity level throughout their pregnancy.   All the nutritional issues that relate to a healthy pregnancy apply to female athletes. Eat a varied and balanced diet with enough calories to support your baby and your own needs while meeting the physical demands of your activity.   Fluid replacement has even more health implications during pregnancy as your own and your baby's blood volume increases. If you don't drink enough fluids, you're at greater risk for dehydration and overheating; early in pregnancy, that can affect the development of your unborn baby. Stay hydrated throughout the day with water plus fat-free or low-fat milk and moderate servings of 100 percentjuice.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Even if you're struggling to pay your bills, there are resources available to help you and your family eat nutritious meals. ""Poor nutrition can impair health and immunity, lower productivity, and hinder development and learning,"" says Alison Kaufman, MS, RD, LDN, Director of Hunger and Nutrition at the Jewish Family & Children's Service of Greater Boston.   If you're finding it difficult to put healthy food on the table, these resources can help.     Get to know SNAP.  Formerly known as Food Stamps, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) can provide additional monthly assistance to buy foods such as fruit, vegetables, bread, cereal, meat, fish, poultry and milk. SNAP dollars aren't limited to your local grocery store. Monthly benefits, provided in the form of a debit card, can also be used at convenience and specialty stores.   Visit your local farmers market.  If your neighborhood doesn't have a local supermarket, you may think it's impossible to find fresh fruits and vegetables. Farmers markets are  sprouting up in many underserved neighborhoods . These markets provide fresh, locally grown produce that you can often purchase with SNAP dollars. And there's another perk: ""Many states will give double dollars for SNAP participants who use farmers markets. So $10 in SNAP benefits will get you $20 in produce,"" says Mary Flynn, PhD, RD, LDN, an associate professor of medicine at Brown University.   If you have children under age 5, check out WIC.  WIC, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, provides supplemental foods, health care referrals, nutrition education and breast-feeding promotion and support to low-income pregnant, breast-feeding and postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age 5 who are at risk for poor nutrition.  If you're eligible , you'll receive foods to meet your unique nutrition requirements as well as those of your young children. WIC foods include iron-fortified cereal, whole-wheat bread, eggs, milk, cheese, beans, peanut butter, canned fish, fruits and vegetables and vitamin C-rich fruit juice. WIC can also provide foods for your baby including baby food and iron-fortified infant cereal and iron-fortified infant formula.   Take advantage of school meals.  Depending on your family's income level, your child may qualify for free or reduced cost breakfast and lunch at school through the National School Breakfast and National School Lunch Programs. Thanks to the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, school meals are healthier than ever, serving up more lean meat, low-fat dairy, whole grains and fruits and vegetables. And good nutrition doesnt necessarily take a break when school lets out. The Afterschool Meal Program may provide snacks or dinner to children in eligible school programs. ""For children with parents that work shifts during the evening meal, dinner programs provide many children with the only food they will have access to after school,"" says Flynn. Even when school isnt in session, the Summer Food Service Program provides nutritious meals to fill the void.     The following websites provide additional information about these programs.

7 Steps for Nursing Success

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    It's no secret breast-feeding is best for baby and best for mom. In fact, the Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticsrecommends exclusively breast-feeding for the first six months to provide optimal nutrition and health protection, and breast-feeding with the addition of complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12 months of age.   Breast milk's unique antibodies, or disease-fighting cells, help protect infants from numerous illnesses and diseases. And, breast-feeding also helps reduce a nursing mother's risk of diabetes, postpartum depression and breast and ovarian cancers.   Breast-feeding has both environmental and economic benefits, since it eliminates the costs and wastes associated with formula production and plastic bottles. Depending on the formula brand, breast-feeding can save your family $1,000 to $4,000 per year.   While breast-feeding is the most natural way to feed a baby, new moms need information and support to be successful. Here are seven steps for breast-feeding success.   Before Your Baby Arrives   The third trimester of pregnancy is a great time to learn about breast-feeding, so you can be informed and confident when the baby comes.      Take a Breast-feeding Class   Check for availability at your hospital, doctor's office or WIC clinic. Learn about community resources, such as certified lactation consultants, so you'll know who to call with questions or concerns.    Read and Research   Check out books and pamphlets from the clinic, hospital or library. The more you know, the more relaxed you'll be in your new role as a breast-feeding mom.   Tell Everyone Your Plans to Breast-feed   Let your family, friends, doctor, hospital nurses, pediatrician and employer know you plan to give only breast milk to your baby and you'll need their support.     At the Hospital   Healthy newborns know how to find the breast and how to suckle. They just need plenty of snuggle time with mom to practice and for mom to build up a good milk supply.     ""Room in"" and Feed Frequently   Having your baby by your side allows you to respond to baby's hunger cues immediately. The more milk your baby removes from the breasts, the more milk you will make. Formula feeding will disrupt this natural process.   Ask for Help   Most hospitals have a lactation specialist who can help you find solutions if you're experiencing difficulties with early breast-feeding.     During the First Year and Beyond   Your breasts will easily make enough milk in response to your baby's growing needs. Most infants will need several feedings through the day and night, especially during the first weeks and growth spurts. Allow your baby to develop his or her own feeding schedule.     Take Care of Yourself   Breast-feeding moms need plenty of nutrient-rich foods and fluids to maintain their stamina while producing milk. Make sure to get enough rest. Many moms take a nap while their babies sleep.   Don't Be Afraid to Seek Help   If you need help figuring how to breast-feed while working or going to school, or if you have an infant with special needs, check with your pediatrician, lactation specialist or a registered dietitian nutritionist.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Does being pregnant mean saying goodbye to softball, tennis or any other sport you enjoy? Not necessarily.   Being physically active during pregnancy offers women many health benefits, among them a psychological lift, optimal weight gain and better aerobic fitness. For most pregnancies, mild to moderate physical activity benefits mom and won't affect your unborn child. Consider these benefits to staying active during pregnancy. You can:     Look and feel good as your body changes.   Promote muscle tone, stamina and strength.   Reduce leg and back pain, constipation, swelling and bloating.   Promote blood circulation and possibly help prevent varicose veins.   Help your posture and balance, which is very important as your center of gravity shifts.   Sleep better.   Prepare your body for labor and childbirth.   Get your body back in shape after delivery.     From  2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans : Pregnant and Postpartum Women   Healthy women who are not already doing vigorous-intensity physical activity should get at least 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Preferably, this activity should be spread throughout the week. Women who regularly engage in vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or high amounts of activity can continue their activity provided that their condition remains unchanged and they talk to their health care provider about their activity level throughout their pregnancy.   All the nutritional issues that relate to a healthy pregnancy apply to female athletes. Eat a varied and balanced diet with enough calories to support your baby and your own needs while meeting the physical demands of your activity.   Fluid replacement has even more health implications during pregnancy as your own and your baby's blood volume increases. If you don't drink enough fluids, you're at greater risk for dehydration and overheating; early in pregnancy, that can affect the development of your unborn baby. Stay hydrated throughout the day with water plus fat-free or low-fat milk and moderate servings of 100 percentjuice.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    It's no secret breast-feeding is best for baby and best for mom. In fact, the Academy of Nutrition and Dieteticsrecommends exclusively breast-feeding for the first six months to provide optimal nutrition and health protection, and breast-feeding with the addition of complementary foods from 6 months until at least 12 months of age.   Breast milk's unique antibodies, or disease-fighting cells, help protect infants from numerous illnesses and diseases. And, breast-feeding also helps reduce a nursing mother's risk of diabetes, postpartum depression and breast and ovarian cancers.   Breast-feeding has both environmental and economic benefits, since it eliminates the costs and wastes associated with formula production and plastic bottles. Depending on the formula brand, breast-feeding can save your family $1,000 to $4,000 per year.   While breast-feeding is the most natural way to feed a baby, new moms need information and support to be successful. Here are seven steps for breast-feeding success.   Before Your Baby Arrives   The third trimester of pregnancy is a great time to learn about breast-feeding, so you can be informed and confident when the baby comes.      Take a Breast-feeding Class   Check for availability at your hospital, doctor's office or WIC clinic. Learn about community resources, such as certified lactation consultants, so you'll know who to call with questions or concerns.    Read and Research   Check out books and pamphlets from the clinic, hospital or library. The more you know, the more relaxed you'll be in your new role as a breast-feeding mom.   Tell Everyone Your Plans to Breast-feed   Let your family, friends, doctor, hospital nurses, pediatrician and employer know you plan to give only breast milk to your baby and you'll need their support.     At the Hospital   Healthy newborns know how to find the breast and how to suckle. They just need plenty of snuggle time with mom to practice and for mom to build up a good milk supply.     ""Room in"" and Feed Frequently   Having your baby by your side allows you to respond to baby's hunger cues immediately. The more milk your baby removes from the breasts, the more milk you will make. Formula feeding will disrupt this natural process.   Ask for Help   Most hospitals have a lactation specialist who can help you find solutions if you're experiencing difficulties with early breast-feeding.     During the First Year and Beyond   Your breasts will easily make enough milk in response to your baby's growing needs. Most infants will need several feedings through the day and night, especially during the first weeks and growth spurts. Allow your baby to develop his or her own feeding schedule.     Take Care of Yourself   Breast-feeding moms need plenty of nutrient-rich foods and fluids to maintain their stamina while producing milk. Make sure to get enough rest. Many moms take a nap while their babies sleep.   Don't Be Afraid to Seek Help   If you need help figuring how to breast-feed while working or going to school, or if you have an infant with special needs, check with your pediatrician, lactation specialist or a registered dietitian nutritionist.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Does being pregnant mean saying goodbye to softball, tennis or any other sport you enjoy? Not necessarily.   Being physically active during pregnancy offers women many health benefits, among them a psychological lift, optimal weight gain and better aerobic fitness. For most pregnancies, mild to moderate physical activity benefits mom and won't affect your unborn child. Consider these benefits to staying active during pregnancy. You can:     Look and feel good as your body changes.   Promote muscle tone, stamina and strength.   Reduce leg and back pain, constipation, swelling and bloating.   Promote blood circulation and possibly help prevent varicose veins.   Help your posture and balance, which is very important as your center of gravity shifts.   Sleep better.   Prepare your body for labor and childbirth.   Get your body back in shape after delivery.     From  2008 Physical Activity Guidelines for Americans : Pregnant and Postpartum Women   Healthy women who are not already doing vigorous-intensity physical activity should get at least 2 hours and 30 minutes (150 minutes) of moderate-intensity aerobic activity a week. Preferably, this activity should be spread throughout the week. Women who regularly engage in vigorous-intensity aerobic activity or high amounts of activity can continue their activity provided that their condition remains unchanged and they talk to their health care provider about their activity level throughout their pregnancy.   All the nutritional issues that relate to a healthy pregnancy apply to female athletes. Eat a varied and balanced diet with enough calories to support your baby and your own needs while meeting the physical demands of your activity.   Fluid replacement has even more health implications during pregnancy as your own and your baby's blood volume increases. If you don't drink enough fluids, you're at greater risk for dehydration and overheating; early in pregnancy, that can affect the development of your unborn baby. Stay hydrated throughout the day with water plus fat-free or low-fat milk and moderate servings of 100 percentjuice.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    Even if you're struggling to pay your bills, there are resources available to help you and your family eat nutritious meals. ""Poor nutrition can impair health and immunity, lower productivity, and hinder development and learning,"" says Alison Kaufman, MS, RD, LDN, Director of Hunger and Nutrition at the Jewish Family & Children's Service of Greater Boston.   If you're finding it difficult to put healthy food on the table, these resources can help.     Get to know SNAP.  Formerly known as Food Stamps, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) can provide additional monthly assistance to buy foods such as fruit, vegetables, bread, cereal, meat, fish, poultry and milk. SNAP dollars aren't limited to your local grocery store. Monthly benefits, provided in the form of a debit card, can also be used at convenience and specialty stores.   Visit your local farmers market.  If your neighborhood doesn't have a local supermarket, you may think it's impossible to find fresh fruits and vegetables. Farmers markets are  sprouting up in many underserved neighborhoods . These markets provide fresh, locally grown produce that you can often purchase with SNAP dollars. And there's another perk: ""Many states will give double dollars for SNAP participants who use farmers markets. So $10 in SNAP benefits will get you $20 in produce,"" says Mary Flynn, PhD, RD, LDN, an associate professor of medicine at Brown University.   If you have children under age 5, check out WIC.  WIC, the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, provides supplemental foods, health care referrals, nutrition education and breast-feeding promotion and support to low-income pregnant, breast-feeding and postpartum women, and to infants and children up to age 5 who are at risk for poor nutrition.  If you're eligible , you'll receive foods to meet your unique nutrition requirements as well as those of your young children. WIC foods include iron-fortified cereal, whole-wheat bread, eggs, milk, cheese, beans, peanut butter, canned fish, fruits and vegetables and vitamin C-rich fruit juice. WIC can also provide foods for your baby including baby food and iron-fortified infant cereal and iron-fortified infant formula.   Take advantage of school meals.  Depending on your family's income level, your child may qualify for free or reduced cost breakfast and lunch at school through the National School Breakfast and National School Lunch Programs. Thanks to the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010, school meals are healthier than ever, serving up more lean meat, low-fat dairy, whole grains and fruits and vegetables. And good nutrition doesnt necessarily take a break when school lets out. The Afterschool Meal Program may provide snacks or dinner to children in eligible school programs. ""For children with parents that work shifts during the evening meal, dinner programs provide many children with the only food they will have access to after school,"" says Flynn. Even when school isnt in session, the Summer Food Service Program provides nutritious meals to fill the void.     The following websites provide additional information about these programs.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.      Reviewed by Eleese Cunningham, RDN     Does eating seafood while pregnant seem  fishy ? You're not alone in thinking so. Pregnant women are bombarded with lists of things they can't eat, and misinformation about seafood abounds. But the truth is that pregnant women can and should eat fish (with a few exceptions).   Why Eat Fish?   It's true that not all fish is safe for pregnant women, but avoiding seafood can be detrimental too. Pregnant women should aim to eat eight to no more than 12 ounces of safe seafood a week. And, here's why.   Fish is full of protein and iron.  Pregnant women need at least 27 milligrams of iron a day (up from 18 milligrams pre-pregnancy) to help prevent anemia, and 71 grams of protein daily (up from 46 grams) to support the baby's growth and a woman's own physical changes. ""Soon-to-be mothers need to make sure they're getting adequate amounts of protein during pregnancy,"" says Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics Spokesperson Jessica Crandall, RDN, CDE, AFAA. ""Fish is encouraged because it's a great source of both protein and iron.""   You and your baby need omega-3 fatty acids.  Oily fish like wild salmon and sardines are high in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), a type of omega-3 fatty acid. ""Omega-3 fatty acids are helpful with decreasing inflammation and also help with infant brain development,"" says Crandall. ""Eating omega-3-rich proteins like fish is very healthy for pregnant women.""   Food aversions may narrow your diet.  Expectant mothers should eat a wide variety of healthy foods, but pregnancy may limit your food tolerances. Fish is a nutrient-rich food, and expectant mothers should add it to their diets if it appeals to them.    Because omega-3 fatty acids are so important for your baby's development, Crandall recommends talking to your doctor to see if you should take a fish or flaxseed oil supplement if you cannot tolerate fish. ""I always choose food as the first line of action, but a supplement can be helpful for those women not eating an adequate amount of omega-3.""   What Fish Is Safe?   Avoid seafood high in methyl mercury and other environmental toxins when pregnant. ""Methyl mercury can damage brain, kidney and central nervous system development of the fetus,"" says Crandall. ""It is a toxic chemical and it builds up most commonly in predatory species of fish. The chemical passes through the placenta and may harm the fetus.""   Mercury is both naturally occurring in our environment and also results from industrial pollution. When it falls from the air and accumulates in water, it becomes methyl mercury. Some fish accumulate more methyl mercury than others, depending on their diet, habitat, size and longevity. Here's what seafood to eat, and what to avoid.   Seafood to Eat and to Avoid   Eat: Eight to 12 ounces per week     Tilapia   Cod   Salmon   Crab   Shrimp   Sardines   Canned light tuna   Pollock   Catfish     Eat: Up to 6 ounces per week     Albacore or ""white"" tuna     Avoid     Shark   Swordfish   King Mackerel   Tilefish   Raw fish (including sushi, sashimi, ceviche and carpaccio) due to food poisoning risk   Refrigerated smoked seafood due to listeria risk     Cook Quality Fish   Check local advisories for food safety alerts before eating locally caught fish. When in doubt, limit your consumption of local seafood to 6 ounces a week.   Quality fish has these characteristics:     Bright, clear eyes   Intact scales   A fresh or mild salt water scent   Firm to the touch with flesh that springs back when pressed   Cold (below 40F) with no ice crystals     Refrigerate fish quickly after purchase, consume it within a day or two of purchase, and cook it to an internal temperature of about 145F to  reduce your risk of food poisoning .

""It is a toxic chemical and it builds up most commonly in predatory species of fish. The chemical passes through the placenta and may harm the fetus.""   Mercury is both naturally occurring in our environment and also results from industrial pollution. When it falls from the air and accumulates in water, it becomes methyl mercury. Some fish accumulate more methyl mercury than others, depending on their diet, habitat, size and longevity. Here's what seafood to eat, and what to avoid.   Seafood to Eat and to Avoid   Eat: Eight to 12 ounces per week     Tilapia   Cod   Salmon   Crab   Shrimp   Sardines   Canned light tuna   Pollock   Catfish     Eat: Up to 6 ounces per week     Albacore or ""white"" tuna     Avoid     Shark   Swordfish   King Mackerel   Tilefish   Raw fish (including sushi, sashimi, ceviche and carpaccio) due to food poisoning risk   Refrigerated smoked seafood due to listeria risk     Cook Quality Fish   Check local advisories for food safety alerts before eating locally caught fish. When in doubt, limit your consumption of local seafood to 6 ounces a week.   Quality fish has these characteristics:     Bright, clear eyes   Intact scales   A fresh or mild salt water scent   Firm to the touch with flesh that springs back when pressed   Cold (below 40F) with no ice crystals     Refrigerate fish quickly after purchase, consume it within a day or two of purchase, and cook it to an internal temperature of about 145F to  reduce your risk of food poisoning . Enjoy fish and the nutritional boost it provides you and your growing baby.         Reviewed June 2014       Tags     Health   Pregnancy   What to Eat When Expecting   For Women"

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    While pregnancy is not the time to lose weight, women should not use their expanding bellies as a reason to eat more than is necessary. The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including her body mass index, or BMI, before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite. All pregnant women should eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods each day. It may also be necessary to take a vitamin and mineral supplement if recommended by a physician.   Many women start off pregnancy with an overweight or obese BMI and many gain more weight than is healthy during their pregnancy. Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy is risky for both mother and child, with some risks including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension (high blood pressure), Cesarean delivery, birth defects and even fetal death. If a women is obese during pregnancy, it also raises the chance her child will be obese later in life.   Weight Gain Guidelines   The latest weight gain guidelines by the Institute of Medicine are based on a women's BMI before pregnancy. ( See Understanding Body Mass Index (BMI) .) The amount of weight gained depends on which category the pre-pregnancy BMI lands in:     Underweight:  BMI below 18.5   Normal weight:  18.5 to 24.9   Overweight:  25.0 to 29.9   Obese:  30.0 and above     The weight ranges below are for a full-term pregnancy:     Underweight:  28 to 40 pounds   Normal:  25 to 35 pounds   Overweight:  15 to 25 pounds   Obese:  11 to 20 pounds     For twins, the recommendations naturally go up:     Normal:  37 to 54 pounds   Overweight:  31 to 50 pounds   Obese:  25 to 42 pounds     There are no set guidelines for underweight BMI weight gain with twins.   Calorie Intake   In general, pregnant women need between 2,200 calories and 2,900 calories a day. A gradual increase in calories as the baby grows is the best bet. Here is an overview of how calorie needs change during each trimester:     The first trimester does not require any extra calories.   During the second trimester, an additional 340 calories a day are recommended.   For the third trimester, the recommendation is 450 calories more a day than when not pregnant.     Additional calories should come from nutrient-dense foods including lean protein, whole grains, dairy, vegetables and fruit. Avoid unneeded extra calories by cutting down on foods high in fat and added sugars such as regular soda, sweets and fried foods.   Physical Activity   Physical activity can help manage weight gain. The activity guidelines for pregnant women are 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days of the week. Make sure to talk with a doctor before starting or continuing any exercise routine while pregnant.         Reviewed January 2017         Tags     Health   Pregnancy   Prenatal Wellness   For Women"

Tell Everyone Your Plans to Breast-feed   Let your family, friends, doctor, hospital nurses, pediatrician and employer know you plan to give only breast milk to your baby and you'll need their support.     At the Hospital   Healthy newborns know how to find the breast and how to suckle. They just need plenty of snuggle time with mom to practice and for mom to build up a good milk supply.     ""Room in"" and Feed Frequently   Having your baby by your side allows you to respond to baby's hunger cues immediately. The more milk your baby removes from the breasts, the more milk you will make.

Ask for Help   Most hospitals have a lactation specialist who can help you find solutions if you're experiencing difficulties with early breast-feeding.

Most infants will need several feedings through the day and night, especially during the first weeks and growth spurts. Allow your baby to develop his or her own feeding schedule.     Take Care of Yourself   Breast-feeding moms need plenty of nutrient-rich foods and fluids to maintain their stamina while producing milk. Make sure to get enough rest.

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    While pregnancy is not the time to lose weight, women should not use their expanding bellies as a reason to eat more than is necessary. The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including her body mass index, or BMI, before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite. All pregnant women should eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods each day. It may also be necessary to take a vitamin and mineral supplement if recommended by a physician.   Many women start off pregnancy with an overweight or obese BMI and many gain more weight than is healthy during their pregnancy. Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy is risky for both mother and child, with some risks including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension (high blood pressure), Cesarean delivery, birth defects and even fetal death. If a women is obese during pregnancy, it also raises the chance her child will be obese later in life.   Weight Gain Guidelines   The latest weight gain guidelines by the Institute of Medicine are based on a women's BMI before pregnancy. ( See Understanding Body Mass Index (BMI) .) The amount of weight gained depends on which category the pre-pregnancy BMI lands in:     Underweight:  BMI below 18.5   Normal weight:  18.5 to 24.9   Overweight:  25.0 to 29.9   Obese:  30.0 and above     The weight ranges below are for a full-term pregnancy:     Underweight:  28 to 40 pounds   Normal:  25 to 35 pounds   Overweight:  15 to 25 pounds   Obese:  11 to 20 pounds     For twins, the recommendations naturally go up:     Normal:  37 to 54 pounds   Overweight:  31 to 50 pounds   Obese:  25 to 42 pounds     There are no set guidelines for underweight BMI weight gain with twins.   Calorie Intake   In general, pregnant women need between 2,200 calories and 2,900 calories a day. A gradual increase in calories as the baby grows is the best bet. Here is an overview of how calorie needs change during each trimester:     The first trimester does not require any extra calories.   During the second trimester, an additional 340 calories a day are recommended.   For the third trimester, the recommendation is 450 calories more a day than when not pregnant.     Additional calories should come from nutrient-dense foods including lean protein, whole grains, dairy, vegetables and fruit. Avoid unneeded extra calories by cutting down on foods high in fat and added sugars such as regular soda, sweets and fried foods.   Physical Activity   Physical activity can help manage weight gain. The activity guidelines for pregnant women are 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days of the week. Make sure to talk with a doctor before starting or continuing any exercise routine while pregnant.         Reviewed January 2017         Tags     Health   Pregnancy   Prenatal Wellness   For Women"

Healthy Weight during Pregnancy

It is also the time of year when the Academy celebrates expertise of registered dietitian nutritionists as the food and nutrition experts.    While pregnancy is not the time to lose weight, women should not use their expanding bellies as a reason to eat more than is necessary. The amount of food a woman needs during pregnancy depends on a number of things including her body mass index, or BMI, before pregnancy, the rate at which she gains weight, age and appetite. All pregnant women should eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods each day. It may also be necessary to take a vitamin and mineral supplement if recommended by a physician.   Many women start off pregnancy with an overweight or obese BMI and many gain more weight than is healthy during their pregnancy. Research shows the risk of problems during pregnancy and delivery is lowest when weight gain is kept within a healthy range. Obesity during pregnancy is risky for both mother and child, with some risks including gestational diabetes, gestational hypertension (high blood pressure), Cesarean delivery, birth defects and even fetal death. If a women is obese during pregnancy, it also raises the chance her child will be obese later in life.   Weight Gain Guidelines   The latest weight gain guidelines by the Institute of Medicine are based on a women's BMI before pregnancy. ( See Understanding Body Mass Index (BMI) .) The amount of weight gained depends on which category the pre-pregnancy BMI lands in:     Underweight:  BMI below 18.5   Normal weight:  18.5 to 24.9   Overweight:  25.0 to 29.9   Obese:  30.0 and above     The weight ranges below are for a full-term pregnancy:     Underweight:  28 to 40 pounds   Normal:  25 to 35 pounds   Overweight:  15 to 25 pounds   Obese:  11 to 20 pounds     For twins, the recommendations naturally go up:     Normal:  37 to 54 pounds   Overweight:  31 to 50 pounds   Obese:  25 to 42 pounds     There are no set guidelines for underweight BMI weight gain with twins.   Calorie Intake   In general, pregnant women need between 2,200 calories and 2,900 calories a day. A gradual increase in calories as the baby grows is the best bet. Here is an overview of how calorie needs change during each trimester:     The first trimester does not require any extra calories.   During the second trimester, an additional 340 calories a day are recommended.   For the third trimester, the recommendation is 450 calories more a day than when not pregnant.     Additional calories should come from nutrient-dense foods including lean protein, whole grains, dairy, vegetables and fruit. Avoid unneeded extra calories by cutting down on foods high in fat and added sugars such as regular soda, sweets and fried foods.   Physical Activity   Physical activity can help manage weight gain. The activity guidelines for pregnant women are 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days of the week. Make sure to talk with a doctor before starting or continuing any exercise routine while pregnant.         Reviewed January 2017         Tags     Health   Pregnancy   Prenatal Wellness   For Women"
