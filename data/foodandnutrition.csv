"Surprising Foods to Avoid if Pregnant
Being more vulnerable to food poisoning, pregnant women should be cautious of the following foods.",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Blog/The-Cutting-Board/June-2015/Surprising-Foods-to-Avoid-if-Pregnant/,"Pregnant women face many changes from physical and lifestyle changes, to changes in what they eat. Some may not realize that pregnant women are more susceptible to food poisoning. During pregnancy your immune system is weakened while your growing babys immune system is undeveloped, making it much harder for both of you to fight off harmful pathogens.   Being  more vulnerable to food poisoning , pregnant women should be cautious of the following foods:   Raw or Undercooked Eggs     Be sure to cook foods with raw eggs or egg mixtures thoroughly to 160F, and avoid raw or undercooked eggs, such as:   Soft-cooked eggs or poached eggs if runny     Unpasteurized eggnog     Avoid homemade foods with raw or undercooked eggs (unless made with pasteurized eggs or a liquid egg substitute), such as:   Caesar salad dressing     Hollandaise sauce   Some puddings and custards   Chocolate mousse   Tiramisu   Cookie dough, cake batter     Raw Dairy Products       Raw or unpasteurized milk or cheeses   Some fresh soft cheeses such as Brie, Camembert, blue-veined varieties, Mexican-style queso fresco     Raw Fish and Shellfish       Sushi, sashimi   Ceviche   Tuna carpaccio   Raw molluscan shellfish: raw clams, oysters, mussels, scallops   Refrigerated smoked fish: lox, jerky, kippered and nova-style     Raw or Rare Meat or Undercooked Poultry       Raw or rare hamburger   Carpaccio (thin shavings of raw beef filet)   Beef or steak tartare     Other       Unpasteurized, refrigerated pate or meat spreads (these are safe if canned or cooked to 165F)   Deli salads specifically ham, chicken and seafood salad   Raw sprouts including alfalfa, clover and radish sprouts   Unpasteurized fruit and vegetable juice   Hot dogs (unless first cooked to 165F)   Deli meats (unless first cooked to 165F)     NOTE: Most pre-made foods from grocery stores, such as Caesar dressing, pre-made cookie dough or packaged eggnog are made with pasteurized eggs.

"How to Build a Fertility-Friendly Food Foundation
Struggling with infertility can be a draining and exhausting life. But here's what we know: nutrition can help. In fact, good nutrition is sometimes unconsciously neglected by many people struggling with infertility",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/June-2016/How-to-Build-a-Fertility-Friendly-Food-Foundation/,"This featured post is by Sara Haas, RDN, LDN, and  Elizabeth Shaw, MS, RD, CLT . Follow Sara on Twitter  @cookinRD  and Elizabeth  @shawsimpleswaps .   Anyone who has struggled  to get pregnant knows the drill: map out a plan for every minute of ovulation, track dates and visit the reproductive endocrinologist's office so often you feel like you practically live there.   Struggling with infertility can be a draining and exhausting life. But here's what we know: nutrition can help. In fact,  good nutrition is sometimes unconsciously neglected by many people struggling with infertility.     Juggling all of the typical demands of daily life along with managing medications and visits to the doctor can be stressful and tiring. Feeling exhausted like that can lead to impulsive eating, causing a person to make less-than-nutritious food choices.   That's where dietitians can help. We can support those trying to get pregnant by educating them on the power of food and providing solutions that make eating healthfully easy. We can speak to the role food plays not only in nourishing and priming your body for conception, but for helping with mood and stress.   In fact, research from the Nurses' Health Study has shown certain foods can actually increase the likelihood of achieving conception and sustaining a healthy, viable pregnancy. Though we can't promise food is a magic pill that will cure infertility, we can promise it's helped us, our clients and countless others feel more in control in a situation that so often feels out of control.   Fertility-Friendly Foundation Foods   Whole Grains  Whole grains help regulate blood sugar. If a diet is high in refined carbohydrates, the pancreas has to work overtime, sending out insulin to drive blood sugar down. This results in a high level of insulin in your bloodstream, which some research has indicated can inhibit ovulation. Encourage clients to make at least 75 percent of their grains whole grains.   Full-Fat Dairy  Research has suggested that switching to full-fat dairy while trying to conceive can increase the odds of getting pregnant. When cream is removed in reduced fat and skim milk products, the sex hormone balance of the milk can be altered, which may affect ovulation and conception. Remember though: full-fat dairy products have more calories, so it's important to enjoy them in moderation.   Fruits and Vegetable  Besides being excellent sources of many vitamins and minerals, fruits and vegetables provide essential nutrients that have been shown to have a direct effect on male and female fertility. For instance, the antioxidant capacity of lycopene has been studied aggressively as a possible solution to male infertility caused by sperm membrane lipid peroxidation. While there is need for further research in this area, it's safe to say the longitudinal research of an overall healthy diet points to the importance of antioxidants in removing free radicals from our bodies.   Plant-Based Protein  Studies show that increasing plant-based protein through consumption of beans, legumes and protein-rich whole grains such as quinoa may continue to enhance your odds of conception.  The Fertility Diet , an excellent book by Dr. Walter Willett, includes great information about the importance of nutrition and plant-based protein on fertility.

"4 Reasons You Aren't Consuming Enough Seafood — and How to Eat More
Seafood has a lot going for it: omega-3s, vitamin D, selenium and choline. Yet, the average American eats less than half of the recommended amount. Why is that, and what do you need to know to strive for more seafood in your diet? ",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/December-2015/4-Reasons-You-Arent-Consuming-Enough-Seafood-and-How-to-Eat-More/,"This featured post is by Elana Natker, MS, RD. You can follow this blogger  @elanaRD .   Seafood has a lot going for it. It's an excellent source of protein and supplies various nutrients including the omega-3  essential fatty acids  eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)  and vitamin D, selenium and choline.   The American Heart Association encourages Americans to have at least two servings of seafood per week  preferably fatty fish for the omega-3 benefits  amounting to about eight ounces total. Yet,  the average intake of seafood is a measly three-and-a-half ounces per week, less than half of the recommendation.     Why is that, and what do you need to know to strive for more seafood in your diet?   ""Seafood is Too Expensive""   And, indeed, fresh varieties often can be listed at a price-per-pound that is more expensive than beef and chicken.Avoid the high prices by trying canned seafood, which can be inexpensive and pre-cooked and may contain more nutrients than fresh. For example, canned salmon contains its bones (which are nearly impossible to tease out) which provides a boost of calcium.   Or, look for sales and don't be afraid to visit the frozen food section. Almost all fish sold in U.S. grocery stores is frozen or thawed from frozen. There is no real difference in nutritional quality or taste.   ""I'm Worried about Sustainability and Farmed Fish""   Fish isn't exactly a local food. Unless you are lucky enough to live near a fish market, most likely you will be purchasing fish that came from overseas. In fact, the United States imports most of its seafood (about 90 percent). But, because all seafood sold in the U.S. is required to have country-of-origin labels (COOL), it is easy to find out where the fish came from.   The  2015 Dietary Guidelines Advisory Committee  did a comprehensive evidence-based review on farmed versus wild-caught fish and found that farm-raised fish is comparable in nutrient quality to wild-caught, and that farm-raised finfish, such as salmon, are more sustainable than animals raised on land in terms of greenhouse gas emissions and land and water use.   If you are worried about the sustainability of seafood, the Monterey Bay Aquarium's Seafood Watch program has  printable consumer guides  for all 50 states  good for home and travel. The three categories  ""Best Choices,"" ""Good Alternatives"" and ""What to Avoid""  make finding ocean-friendly seafood choices based on the season and region easy.   ""I'm Concerned about Mercury, Particularly for Pregnant Women""   The  U.S. Food and Drug Administration  issued a draft revised recommendation for pregnant women, encouraging them to eat eight to 12 ounces of seafood per week, or two to three servings. The benefits of fish consumption far outweigh any risks for mercury contamination, particularly if the top fish sources of mercury (including tilefish, shark, swordfish and king mackerel) are avoided.   ""I Don't Know How to Prepare Seafood""   Findings from USDA research published in 2014 found that inexperience with cooking seafood, coupled with the cost, may be a huge barrier to seafood consumption. In fact, more than two-thirds of seafood in America is eaten outside the home.   Of course, there are plenty of places to find excellent recipes for seafood. For instance, the National Fisheries Institute's website,  AboutSeafood.com , allows users to search for recipes by fish type, cuisine, meal type or cooking technique.   Whatever your reason for not eating enough seafood in the past,  make 2016 the year you meet your dietary goals.

"Are Sprouted Grains Ready for the Limelight?
Once relegated to the back corner of the community health-food store, sprouted grains are becoming a more mainstream option. If you wrote them off as just another fad, you may want to take a closer look",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/September-October-2015/Are-Sprouted-Grains-Ready-for-the-Limelight/,"Photo: Mizina/iStock/Thinkstock     Chances are you've heard about sprouted grains.  Though it may sound like a new trend, sprouted grains have been around for years. Once relegated to the back corner of the community health-food store, sprouted grains are becoming a more mainstream option. If you wrote them off as just another fad, you may want to take a closer look.   Made from whole grains, sprouted grains technically are seeds that germinate and begin to grow under ideal conditions. They generally offer the same or better nutrition benefits compared to regular whole grains. Some of the carbohydrates present in the grain are used as energy to grow the new sprout, leaving a higher concentration of protein and other nutrients. It's believed that the enzymes activated to break down the grain's starchy core yield an easier-to-digest grain and greater nutrient accessibility.   The Nutritional Effects of Sprouting   Depending on the type of grain, the sprouting process may increase vitamin C, folate, soluble fiber and antioxidants, and decrease gluten and insoluble fiber. Due to differences in baseline nutrient content, it's important to note that sprouting does not produce the same effects for every grain.   For example:     Sprouting was shown to enhance the folate concentrations in wheat pita bread as much as four times.   Compared to whole wheat, sprouted wheat was shown to contain more dietary fiber and alpha-tocopherol  the most bioavailable form of vitamin E  among other compounds.   Sprouting millet tripled the bioaccessibility of iron and also improved manganese and calciumbioaccessibility.     Those nutrient changes may yield additional health benefits. Preliminary research supporting the health benefits of sprouted grains is compelling. Several small studies reveal a handful of potential nutrition benefits, including higher dietary fiber and antioxidant capacity. While science confirms nutritive changes to the grain, this does not necessarily prove those benefits will be passed on to the person eating them  though there's hope that it will.   A small Japanese study suggests that sprouted brown rice may help control blood sugar and promote better blood lipid profiles. Similarly, a small Canadian study found that sprouted wheat bread had the mildest glycemic response in overweight male subjects when compared to four other kinds of bread, including white, sourdough, 12-grain and 11-grain varieties. Additional areas of research include exploring the effects of sprouted grains on blood pressure and improved digestibility and tolerance.   What Sprouted Grains Taste Like   Sprouted grains add variety, texture and a unique flavor to meals. Because some of the starches are broken down into sugar during the sprouting process, sprouted grains offer a somewhat sweeter taste. Sprouted grains can be eaten whole, such as in a sprouted rice salad, but more often are dried and milled into flour to make cereals, breads, pastas and other dishes.   As long as the germ and bran are intact, any type of whole grain can be sprouted, including amaranth, barley, wheat, farro, millet, quinoa, rice and more. Altered grains that are hulled, husked, pearled or rolled will not sprout.   Grains are soaked, rinsed, drained and kept moist for sprouting. Sprouted grains used in commercial food production are cultivated in a controlled environment to reduce the risk of food poisoning. The warm and humid conditions required to sprout grains are optimal for bacterial growth such as  Salmonella ,  Listeria  and  E. coli . If these pathogens are present during sprouting, they can grow to unsafe levels. For safety, it's important to fully cook sprouted grains, especially those that will be served to vulnerable populations such as children, pregnant women, the elderly and anyone with a compromised immune system.   A ""soak, rinse and drain"" method is the most common way for consumers to sprout grains at home. Find seeds in the produce section of the supermarket or health-food store, and choose those that are labeled as suitable for sprouting  not regular garden seeds. Food safety can be a concern with DIY grain sprouting due to the moist environment required for sprouts to form. All equipment used should be sterilized and kept clean. And whether produced at home or bought commercially, it's important to refrigerate raw sprouts and cook them thoroughly before eating to minimize the risk of food poisoning.   By and large, sprouted grains are a new concept to most Americans, but they may be the next big trend in baking and snack foods. According to Mintel data, 19 new sprouted-grain products were introduced in 2014. Although this may seem like a small number, experts project it is only the beginning of the trend. Major cereal makers have jumped aboard and are now producing sprouted-grain cereals. Sprouted-grain breads, crackers and tortillas also are fairly easy to find. Consumers can expect to see more products in mainstream supermarkets, including sprouted-grain versions of pastas, bagels, pretzels and more.

Microbiome: The Garden Within
The microbial residents of our gut, skin, eyes and nasal passages collectively are referred to as the ""microbiome"" — and research of its role in human health is revealing surprising discoveries",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/May-June-2015/Microbiome-The-Garden-Within/,"For every cell in the human body, there are about 10 nonhuman cells. These microbial residents of our gut, skin, eyes and nasal passages collectively are referred to as the ""microbiome""  and research of its role in human health has revealed enough surprising discoveries that the National Institutes of Health has launched an international Human Microbiome Project.   The human microbiome refers specifically to the community of microorganisms that live in and on the human body (or any ""host"" animal) and their collective genome, which interacts with our host genes. The microbiota (formerly called ""microflora"") refers to the microorganisms themselves. Our microbiota are affected by everything from how we entered the world to how much time we spend barefoot. Bacteria, yeasts, molds, dirt and the types of food we eat all impact microbiota, thereby influencing the microbiome.   Gut bacteria aid digestion by breaking down otherwise indigestible plant fibers into short-chain fatty acids that intestinal cells can access. Emerging research also suggests that gut bacteria influence many other metabolic functions, so much so that some experts now regard it as a ""hidden"" organ system, capable of interacting with its host down to DNA expression. As a result, the microbiome's role in conditions as varied as irritable bowel diseases, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, depression, autoimmune disorders and Parkinson's disease is under intense scientific scrutiny. The core questions remain: How does the microbiome become altered in a way that negatively affects the host, and how does a host build better microbiota?   Establishing the Colony   The bacteria that our immune systems recognize as ""normal"" (the bacteria that will prevail in our guts or the duration of our lives) is established by our first exposure to our mothers' microbial mix. Babies born vaginally are colonized by microbes present in the birth canal, primarily by strains of Lactobacillus species that differ from non-pregnant women. By contrast, babies born via cesarean section are colonized by the microbiota of a mother's skin and whatever other bacteria happen to be present at birth, predominantly Staphylococcus species.   First foods matter as well. Breast milk has its own microbiota that differ depending on whether the mother gave birth vaginally or via C-section, possibly due to the antibiotics women receive before and after C-section delivery. Breast milk contains oligosaccharides that act as prebiotics  food for the infant's developing intestinal community. After birth, infants begin to cultivate their own bacterial mix until the developing microbiota reach a relatively stable state, shaped by environment and diet. By age 2, the child's microbiota are believed to resemble an adult's.   An Evolving System   Our microbiome co-evolves with us and influences our metabolism, physiology, nutrition and immune function. Once the microbiome is established, it is believed to be relatively stable throughout a person's life, although short- and long-term changes can occur. Antibiotics dramatically affect the microbiome. The ability of the microbial residents to bounce back after a round of antibiotics varies greatly among individuals, and multiple rounds of antibiotics can significantly shift the types of microbes that survive. Often this kind of disruption leads to dysbiosis, an imbalance of beneficial and pathogenic bacteria and other microbes.   Dietary changes also significantly alter the microbiome, and preliminary human studies suggest that these changes can occur in as little as three days. Interestingly, while what we eat alters our microbiomes, the microbiota also appear to influence what we choose to eat, as microbes compete for space and nutrients. Researchers suspect that dominant gut microbes trigger cravings for foods that either benefit them or suppress their bacterial competitors.   Microbes may even create dysphoria in the host until the person succumbs to the craving. Researchers propose several possible mechanisms by which this works: Microbes may be able to influence taste receptors, making certain foods taste better; they may spark the release of hunger-triggering hormones; or they may influence eating habits by hijacking the vagus nerve that connects the gut and brain.   Altered microbiota and dysbiosis may be related to many chronic diseases and conditions, including obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, depression and gut diseases. This link appears to be rooted in inflammation, endotoxemia and possibly changes to the immune system, which means treating the gut may be an effective way for registered dietitian nutritionists to address multiple conditions.   Digestive Health, IBS and IBD   Irritable Bowel Syndrome is an increasingly common functional gastrointestinal disorder, the hallmark symptoms of which include abdominal discomfort or pain, distension and bloating, and diarrhea, constipation or a combination of both. Low-grade inflammation and significant dysbiosis are prominent features of this syndrome. While normal gut microbiota prevent pathogenic bacteria from gaining a foothold on the intestinal lining, dysbiosis may allow the bacteria associated with IBS symptoms to thrive, triggering further inflammation by activating the immune system.   People with IBS often experience higher levels of anxiety, stress and depression, as well as higher rates of metabolic syndrome. While the exact cause of IBS remains unclear, some research points to dysbiosis along with dysregulation of the brain-gut axis and autonomic nervous system. IBS and inflammatory bowel disease  including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease  are associated with increased intestinal permeability (sometimes referred to as ""leaky gut syndrome""). IBS typically features low levels of beneficial Bifidobacterium bacteria; IBD, which also may be triggered by dysbiosis, features low bacterial diversity. Probiotics have shown to be effective therapeutic interventions for both IBS and IBD, shown to improve intestinal integrity, alleviate symptoms, reduce inflammation and strengthen the intestinal barrier.   Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome   Obesity and its consequences are a complex set of syndromes. Lifestyle, diet and exercise habits contribute significantly to this ""diabesity"" epidemic, though changes to the microbiota also appear to play a role by influencing weight gain and metabolism. From animal studies, we've learned that transferring gut bacteria from obese animals to germ-free, lean animals induces obesity and metabolic disease, even when diets are unchanged.   While the relationship of microbiota and weight in humans is less clear, studies have consistently demonstrated dysbiosis in people with Type 2 diabetes. Healthy control subjects tend to have more bacteria that produce the shortchain fatty acid butyrate, and individuals with Type 2 diabetes tend to have higher levels of pathogens, such as Clostridium species, though research has not yet confirmed whether a difference in gut microbes is a contributing factor or an effect. In addition, when pathogen-free microbiota from lean, healthy donors are transferred to patients with metabolic disease, insulin sensitivity improves.   Microbiota and Mood   Lending credence to the gut's reputation as a ""second brain,"" it's been observed that stress and depression are linked with IBS and IBD, and the microbiome also may play a role. Psychological and physiological stress affects the gut in ways that alter the microbiota and foster dysbiosis, bacterial overgrowth and intestinal permeability. These changes trigger inflammation and affect the brain and central nervous system through increased toxic exposures (endotoxins from bacterial metabolites enter the bloodstream through a ""leaky gut"") and neurotransmitter disruption. Gut microbes produce hormones and neurotransmitters that are taken up by the human brain.   Preliminary research indicates that changes to the microbiome may affect things such as mood, anxiety, memory and concentration. Rodent studies have found that manipulating the microbiome results in changed behavior. However, while an anti-inflammatory diet could provide some benefit, there aren't any large-scale human studies that clarify the role of dietary intervention on the central nervous system with respect to changes to the microbiome.   Mind Your Microbes   Amid mounting interest in its influence on human health and disease, attention has turned to therapeutic approaches that target the gut. A diet high in fruit, vegetables and perhaps whole grains allows beneficial bacteria to dominate and inhibits the growth of more harmful strains. While researchers haven't reached consensus about what constitutes an optimal microbiome, there is some general advice for tending our microbial gardens:        Fruit and Vegetables   A plant-centric diet rich in vegetables, fruit and legumes, and high in dietary fiber and polyphenols, appears to benefit the microbiota. These foods offer intestinal bacteria fuel in the form of prebiotics.      Fermented Foods   While beneficial bacterial strains found in fermented foods may not settle into the gut permanently, they may affect microbiota by influencing the gene expression of the bacteria already there. Naturally fermented foods, such as yogurt and kefir with ""live, active cultures,"" sauerkraut, kimchi, tempeh and raw vinegar, are high in beneficial Lactobacillus bacteria. To get the benefits, be sure the foods are ""lactofermented"" or naturally fermented and raw or unpasteurized, as pasteurization kills beneficial bacteria.     Garden Herbs   Garlic and leeks contain natural sources of the prebiotic inulin. Garlic also has natural antimicrobial properties, which may help suppress pathogenic bacteria and foster beneficial bacteria growth.      Focus on Fresh   Enjoy minimally processed foods and limit sugar and unhealthy fats, especially trans fats. Some studies have associated diets of highly-processed foods with dysbiosis and pro-inflammatory microbiota.      Probiotic Supplements   Consider taking a high-quality probiotic supplement (with several different strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, such as L. acidophilus, L. reuteri, B. longum and B. bifidum), particularly during and after antibiotic use to recolonize the digestive tract and help manage antibiotic-induced diarrhea. Since antibiotics kill all bacteria, it is best to take probiotic supplements at least two hours before or after taking antibiotics.

Today's Contemporary Spice Cabinet
Today’s home cook is likely to keep at least 40 different seasonings on hand, whereas the typical 1950’s American homemaker relied on fewer than 10 spices",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Winter-2012/Todays-Contemporary-Spice-Cabinet/,"When I was a child, my mother (who wasand still isa wonderful cook) had a small wooden spice rack with two rows of stoppered glass bottles. Those 16 little vials contained pretty much everything she needed, from ground cloves for Thanksgiving pumpkin pies to paprika she dusted on deviled eggs. Today, my mothers spice collection fills a cupboard thats four feet high and two feet deep. Ask her for the paprika, and shell ask you whether you want sweet, hot or smoked.     According to McCormick, which has been selling herbs and spices since 1889, todays home cook is likely to keep at least 40 different seasonings on hand, whereas the typical 1950s American homemaker relied on fewer than 10 spices. Although the three best-selling flavorings (black pepper, vanilla extract and cinnamon) havent changed since the end of World War II, the rest of the spice rack has undergone a dramatic transformation. McCormicks sales figures indicate that allspice, lemon extract, ground mustard and celery seed all top sellers in the postwar yearshave slid in popularity, while oregano, cumin, coriander and smoked paprika have risen through the ranks.     Adventurous Cooks, Sophisticated Palates     Generations of immigrants have brought a rich array of culinary traditions from around the globe to North Americaand today, these exotic cuisines are sought and celebrated like never before. Tanya Wenman Steel, editor-in-chief of the popular  Epicurious  website, sees users filling their online recipe boxes with Indian and Middle Eastern dishes in addition to the usual lasagna and chicken salad. A recent search for the most popular recipes on  Epicurious  tells the tale: South American arepas and Javanese chicken curry vie for top billing with chocolate fudge and apple tart.     American cooks have gotten a lot more adventurous, says food writer and cookbook editor Amanda Hesser, but also more discerning. We not only use a wider range of spices, but weve gotten more sophisticated about layering different flavors to create more complex and intense flavor profiles.     Theres also an increased value on authenticity. Instead of relying on cayenne pepper as an all-purpose source of heat, todays cooks might use certain peppers for Asian cuisine and others for Latin dishes. Chefs are traveling more widelyand not just to Europeand bringing back exotic ingredients and techniques, says Hesser. And thanks to the speed of information sharing, an ingredient can make the leap from esoteric to household name in a much shorter period of time.     Unusual spices are also getting easier to procure, with mainstream spice vendors vastly expanding their product lines in response to the growing popularity of global cuisines. These days, you might not have to go farther than the grocery store to find chipotle pepper or  garam masala seasonings that most of us didnt even know how to pronounce just a few years ago. And with a few days lead time, you can get just about anything else you could possibly want from online vendors.     From Spice Cabinet to Medicine Cabinet     As ancient healers realized and modern science has confirmed, herbs and spices do much more than flavor our foods. They can also be concentrated sources of nutrients and compounds with medicinal effects. Virtually all herbs and spices display antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. Some of the most commonly used spices display other useful properties, as well. According to the Therapeutic Research Centers Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database:       Cinnamon  has been shown to improve blood sugar control in diabetics in some studies although other studies showed no benefit.     Garlic  may slow the development of atherosclerosis and seems to be able to modestly reduce blood pressure. In addition, eating garlic has been linked to a decreased risk of developing stomach and colon cancers, although garlic supplements do not seem to offer this benefit.     Ginger  can help lessen nausea and vomiting in pregnant women and post-operative patients, and it may reduce symptoms of dizziness, including nausea. Also, there is preliminary evidence that ginger may have some benefits in managing osteoarthritis, specifically in reducing pain.     Turmeric , a key ingredient in curry blends, has been shown to reduce symptoms of indigestion.       Making Food Safer with Spices     The preservative power of spices was also well understood by the ancients, who used spices to slow the spoilage of perishables and even to embalm their dead. Today, food scientists are increasingly interested in spices as a way to make our food supply safer, testing the ability of various herbs and extracts to kill  E. coli  bacteria in meat, for example. Although far from providing surefire protection from foodborne illness, garlic, clove and oregano are among the most promising candidates.     Even more encouraging is the ability of certain herbs and spices to reduce the formation of harmful compounds formed when meats are cooked at high temperatures, such as on a grill. According to a study in the October 2011  Journal of Food Science , adding rosemary or turmeric to a burger can reduce the formation of heterocyclic amines by up to 40 percent. A separate study published in the May 2010  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition  found adding a mixture of ground cloves, cinnamon, oregano, ginger, rosemary, black pepper, paprika and garlic powder to burgers reduces the formation of carcinogenic and atherogenic compounds by 70 percent.     Storing and Using Spices     One possible downside to an ever-expanding repertoire of spices: Stocking dozens of different seasonings to fuel your culinary adventures increases the chances that spices will sit in the cupboard for a long time before you use them. Whenever possible, buy spices in amounts that you can use within 12 months. For unusual ingredients that you use rarely, look for a store that sells spices in bulk so that you can buy only as much as you need. And to keep herbs and spices at their peak of flavor and nutritional potency, that wooden rack next to the stove has got to go. Spices should be kept away from heat, moisture and light, and they are best stored in a cool, dark cupboard in airtight containers."

No matter how prolific the evidence nor how well presented our website, there will always be someone who asks, ""Can a vegetarian diet provide enough?"" Enough might mean enough protein, enough variety, enough nutrients, enough of whatever the questioner fears might be lacking",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/June-2013/Is-a-Vegan-Diet-Enough/,"This featured post is by  Sarah Ellis, MS, RD .      No matter how prolific the evidence nor how well presented our website, there will always be someone who asks, ""Can a vegetarian diet provide  enough ?""  Enough  might mean enough protein, enough variety, enough nutrients,  enough  of whatever the questioner fears might be lacking.     It's not surprising that this question continues to be asked. The societal belief that a well-balanced diet must include meat, fish, poultry and dairy foods is deeply ingrained and has some roots in the association of these foods with an individual's ability to procure them, that is, one's personal affluence. During World Wars I and II, many foodstuffs were rationed including butter, sugar, meat, and coffee. Transportation of food was limited by fuel rationing and so people began to cultivate their own gardens and raise their own chickens. Thus, Victory Gardens appeared where flowers once grew or cars once parked. The 'Eat locally' movement had begun but with a slightly different intent than today's locavores.     Naturally, with the rationing came a sense of deprivation that persisted until the end of the wars and the relative improvement of choices in the market. As people were able to add some of the former luxuries back into their regular diets, it wasn't long before these luxuries became daily staples.     It's worth noting here that as countries around the world become increasingly more developed and affluent, their diets also change to include the very luxuries mentioned above  fat, sugar, meat and another, alcohol. Patterns of disease in those countries parallel the dietary changes as both become more like disease and diets seen in Western countries.     So the question remains: ""Does a vegetarian diet provide  enough ?""     Consider a sample platter of foods consisting of:       White lima beans    These are this meal's primary source of protein, with one cup providing 16 grams or about 30 percent of an adult woman's daily requirement. The limas' 30 grams of fiber meet the daily recommendation for adults and do a great job of modulating blood sugar, providing satiety and maintaining intestinal health. Besides being rich in potassium, white lima beans pack iron to the tune of 60 percent of the adult recommended daily intake. There are 140 calories in one cup.     Sugar snap peas    Actually a hybrid of English peas and snow peas, these are completely edible. One cup has barely 30 calories but more than 60 percent of recommended vitamin C intake. This is a vitamin K rich vegetable, which is why it is so aptly included in the lunch for pregnant women.     Watermelon    This much-maligned fruit also does its share to support good health by providing vitamins B6, C and K, plus potassium and lycopene, a beneficial phytochemical found only in red-pigmented fruits and vegetables. One cup has about 50 calories, a trace of protein, but no fat or cholesterol. What is fascinating about the protein is that it is comprised of amino acids that can metabolize to nitric oxide, a substance that helps to maintain artery function and thus improve blood pressure.     Mixed greens and herb salad    Without examining the familiar nutrient gifts of this salad, you can see that a lunch comprised of what we have just discussed can be not only quite filling but also nutrient dense, providing almost a third of a woman's daily protein needs, wrapped in a wide variety of vitamins and minerals as well as including  enough  fiber for the day.       These nutrients promote good health; the fruit and vegetable packages they come in are visually and gastronomically pleasing, and the relatively low caloric load helps to maintain a healthful weight.     Is this not  enough  to make you curious to learn more about a vegetarian diet?

Is Spirulina a Miracle Cure-all?
Arguably the “superfood” of the moment, spirulina is associated with a number of health claims, from curing allergies and candida to detoxifying the body and aiding in weight loss. Does this blue-green algae deliver, or is it all health hype",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/November-December-2016/Is-Spirulina-a-Miracle-Cure-all/,"Thinkstock.com/Kesu01     Arguably the superfood of the moment,  spirulina is associated with a number of health claims, from curing allergies and candida to detoxifying the body and aiding in weight loss. Does this blue-green algae deliver, or is it all health hype?   As it turns out, these claims are backed by little science and likely surfaced due to spirulinas impressive nutrient profile. One ounce, or approximately 4 tablespoons, of dried spirulina contains 81 calories, 16 grams of protein, 60 percent of the daily value of riboflavin, 44 percent of the daily value of iron and thiamin, 14 percent of the daily value of magnesium and 11 percent of the daily value of potassium.   The Natural Medicines Comprehensive Database lists all health claims associated with spirulina as having insufficient evidence to rate, and warns that women who are pregnant or breast-feeding should avoid it. There also is some evidence that spirulina could interact with anticoagulant, antiplatelet and immunosuppressant drugs. Due to its high protein content, people with phenylketonuria, or PKU, should not consume spirulina.   After the Natural Medicines monograph was updated in 2015, a double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial of 40 individuals with hypertension was published in 2016. It found that consuming 2 grams of spirulina for three months led to improved BMI, body weight and blood pressure in this small sample. While spirulina is very protein-dense and these results seem promising, there is not enough information at this time to recommend it as a supplement for specific health conditions.   Due to its growing popularity, spirulina is cultivated in ponds and mass-produced all over the world, including Hawaii and China. Spirulinas distinctive and strong seaweed flavor leads many people to consume it via capsule, while others mix the powder form into water, juice or smoothies. Contamination by toxins and heavy metals is a serious concern, so it is important to choose a spirulina supplement with reliable third-party testing and quality assurance.

"Can Diet Help Manage Amenorrhea?
A woman has missed three or more consecutive periods and she isn't pregnant, she may have secondary amenorrhea. Some female athletes suffer from amenorrhea not because of their exercise intensity, but because their energy intake is too low to support their activity levels.",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/May-June-2014/Can-Diet-Help-Manage-Amenorrhea/,"Photo: iStock       A woman has missed three or more consecutive periods and she isn't pregnant, she may have secondary amenorrhea. Some female athletes suffer from amenorrhea not because of their exercise intensity, but because their energy intake is too low to support their activity levels.     Amenorrhea can be linked to serious health problems, including the loss of calcium from bones, endometrial hyperplasia and heart disease. Women suffering from secondary amenorrhea have a higher incidence of stress fractures and long-term problems with osteoporosis.     Any woman experiencing amenorrhea should see her doctor, but these sports nutrition strategies can help female athletes match their energy intakes to their energy outputs.       Take a Break from Dieting    Rather than fixating on a number on the scale, the athlete should achieve a natural, healthy weight given her age, body composition and genetics. Small calorie deficits can help the athlete lose excess body fat without compromising energy levels.     Eat Adequate Protein    When an athlete under eats, her body burns protein for energy, and some of that protein may come from muscles. This causes muscle wasting, which leads to weaker bones and stress fractures.     Eat Calcium-Rich Food at Each Meal    Exercise alone is not enough to keep bones strong. Inadequate calcium and vitamin D intake increases the risk of low bone-mineral density and stress fractures, especially in female athletes with low energy intakes.     Get Adequate Vitamin D    Sunlight on the skin helps produce vitamin D, but indoor athletes who get little sun should choose foods fortified with vitamin D in addition to eggs, mushrooms and fatty fish such as salmon.     Don't Fear Fat    Healthful fat should constitute 20 percent to 35 percent of energy intake. Fat provides essential fatty acids and helps absorption of vitamins A, D, E and K, all of which help keep an athlete healthy and performing well.

"Does Celiac Disease Cause Infertility?
It’s commonly known that around 1 percent of the population has celiac disease — a severe autoimmune reaction to gluten — and we often think of it as a gastrointestinal disorder. But celiac is four to eight times more common in women who are experiencing infertility without any other known cause",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/April-2013/Does-Celiac-Disease-Cause-Infertility/,"This featured post is by  Cheryl Harris, MPH, RD . You can follow this blogger  @CherylHarrisRD .       Infertility is one of the hardest things for couples who want children, and celiac disease is frequently an overlooked cause.     Its commonly known that around 1 percent of the population has  celiac disease   a severe autoimmune reaction to  gluten   and we often think of it as a gastrointestinal disorder. But celiac is four to eight times more common in women who are experiencing infertility without any other known cause.This is a particularly tricky issue, because many of these women are not experiencing any of the typical celiac tummy troubles, and most dont even have anemia, which is often the most visible sign of celiac.     Many doctors now suggest screening for celiac when there isnt another obvious cause for infertility. Its also a much simpler and less invasive test than many of the infertility procedures. If youre reading this, most likely celiac already is on your radar screen, but you know as well as I do that this isnt universal. Since theres such a genetic link involved, if you have family members who are experiencing infertility or miscarriages, or if you know people experiencing infertility, do consider passing this information along! (Gently, of course, to people who you think might be open to it.)     Whats Causing the Infertility?     With untreated celiac disease, every time the mom-to-be eats gluten, her body attacks the small intestine, which often causes nutritional deficiencies. Obviously this makes it harder to get pregnant and to have a healthy pregnancy. The nutrients people with celiac arent absorbing well are the same ones that grow babies: such as iron, vitamin D, B vitamins, zinc, magnesium, calcium, etc.     But theres more than that. An untreated autoimmune disease  even without  nutrient deficiencies isnt good for mom or baby. The same tissue transglutaminase antibodies that doctors look at to identify active celiac disease and how patients are responding to a  gluten-free  diet can actually interfere with pregnancy. According to Daniel Leffler, MD, MS, director of clinical research at the Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, It turns out that antibodies affect the placenta in negative ways. We thought they were just good diagnostic markers, but they also seem to bind to and wreak havoc on many areas of the body.     This also means that moms-to-be will have the best chance of a healthy pregnancy if they wait six months or until the tTg (tissue transglutaminase) levels are back to normal and nutritional deficiencies are corrected. Because, at the end of the day, the goal is not just getting pregnant, but having a happy, healthy baby.     Dont Forget Dad     We tend to focus on the mom, but if the dad has untreated celiac,  he  may be the cause of infertility. Vitamins A and E and zinc are critical to sperm production. And one study even showed that fathers with untreated celiac were five times more likely to have low-birth weight babies.     Smart Steps and Tips     So, if you want to get pregnant and have celiac disease, make sure youve checked with your doctor about nutritional deficiencies and your thyroid, too. People with celiac are more likely to have autoimmune thyroid diseases, too, such as Hashimotos or Graves, which often show up during and after pregnancy.     Its also critical to make sure youre eating a balanced diet. Most  gluten-free  products arent fortified the way regular products are, and  many are both higher calorie and higher in empty, starchy carbs , too. The nutrients that are low in the diets of women with on a gluten-free diet (iron, B vitamins, calcium, fiber) are needed by both mom and baby.     Snacks can be the hardest, because its typical to reach for whatever is lying around. But for most people who eat gluten-free, a little planning goes a long way. Chopped fruits and veggies like carrots, celery, peppers, etc. are wonderful foods to pack and go. Nuts and seeds are always perfect options because they are shelf-stable. When refrigeration isnt an issue, a yogurt or a cheese stick works well.     Want to learn more? Check out these sources:        Shah S, Leffler D.

"Salmon Potato Salad (Without Mayo!)
I love using BPA-free canned salmon as an easy way to get fish into our diet without needing to cook it, and as a low-cost alternative to salmon fillets",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/July-2014/Salmon-Potato-Salad-Without-Mayo/,"This featured post is by  Janel Funk, MS, RD, LDN . You can follow this blogger  @DietitianJanel .     Perhaps youve heard the recommendation to eat fish twice a week? Fish and seafood are major sources of healthy omega-3 fats and are also rich in other nutrients like vitamin D, selenium, protein and low in saturated fat. There are new guidelines that encourage pregnant women, women who may become pregnant, or breastfeeding women to eat 8-12 ounces of low-mercury fish twice a week to benefit fetal growth and development. The same goes for children, though the serving size is naturally smaller.     While I have always been a fish fan, my husband and I only managed to eat it a few times a month, whether cooked at home or eaten out at a restaurant. Since having a baby, I have made a conscious effort to cook a fish dish at least twice a week, so now my almost-15-month-old enjoys fish regularly with us as well.     Despite the new recommendations, most people are not coming close to eating fish once a week, let alone twice. Perhaps it is uncertainty on how to cook it, cost or taste preference (though there is a vast variety of fish and seafood flavors and textures). I love using BPA-free canned salmon as an easy way to get fish into our diet without needing to cook it, and as a low-cost alternative to salmon fillets.     I made this salmon potato salad dish for the whole family to enjoy for lunch throughout the week. The hummus makes a nice creamy alternative to mayonnaise, and the salmon adds protein to an otherwise carb-heavy dish. To include veggies, serve this over salad greens for a fantastic summer lunch.

"How to Get Iron from Plant Sources
Iron is an important mineral that serves many purposes in the body. Adequate iron intake is essential for growth development, normal cell function and synthesis of hormones and connective tissue. ",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/July-2016/How-to-Get-Iron-from-Plant-Sources/,"This post is by  Jessica Cording, MS, RD, CDN . Connect with her on Twitter @ JessCording .   Iron deficiency is one of the most  common nutrient deficiencies worldwide. It is associated with poor diet, blood loss and malabsorptive disorders. Even the U.S. has high rates, though iron deficiencyisusuallyrelated to conditions that cause iron loss or malabsorption as opposed to frank iron deficiency.   What Dietary Iron Does   Dietary iron is an important mineral that serves many purposes in the body. It's needed to make hemoglobin, a part of red blood cells that helps transport oxygen and carbon dioxide through the body. Adequate iron intake is essential for growth and development, normal cell function and synthesis of hormones and connective tissue.    Dietary iron recommendations vary depending on age and gender:     Males aged 14 to 18: 11 milligrams per day   Males 19 and older: 8 milligrams per day   Females aged 14 to 18: 15 milligram per day   Females aged 19 to 50: 18 milligrams   Pregnant females: 27milligrams   Females 51 and older: 8 milligrams     The groups most at risk for iron deficiency are teenage girls and premenopausal women because they lose iron through blood every month during menstruation; pregnant women; infants; and young children.   Certain individuals are actually at risk of excessive iron intake. For example, individuals with hemachromatosis need to be mindful of how much iron they consume, as the condition causes increased iron absorption.   Two Forms of Iron   Iron is found in two forms: heme and non-heme. Heme iron ismore highly absorbable and comes from animal sources such as beef, chicken, pork and fish.Non-heme iron comes from plantsources and fortified products (and also from animal sources).   Reaching the recommended amount of iron can be difficult, and may be even more so for those who do not consume meat. That said, it's absolutely doable, it just takes a little extra planning.   Plant-Based Sources of Iron   Beans  Cooked white beans provide 4milligrams of iron of per -cup serving;kidney beans provide 1.5milligrams; and black beans provide 2.2milligrams of iron. They're all great options for iron.   Dark Leafy Greens  Enjoyed in a salad, blended into a smoothie or cooked and served, dark leafy greens such as chard, kale and spinach are a convenient way to up iron intake.   Lentils  Perfect on a salad, in soups, served with cooked veggies or made into burgers, a -cup serving of lentils cook quickly and contribute 3 milligrams.   Tofu  A -cup serving of tofu provides 2 milligrams of iron.   Whole Grains  Quinoa, brown rice and oats are just a few of the many iron-rich whole grains.   Fortified Products  It may feel like ""cheating,"" but fortified cereals and grain products can make a big difference, especially when it comes to busy days or picky eaters. Many products provide up to 100-percent of daily value for iron.   Don't Forget Vitamin C   One last note  be sure toaccompany plant sources ofiron with vitamin C-rich foods to promote iron absorption. For example, a chili made with black beans, peppers and tomato; or lentils and leafy greens served over vitamin C-rich cauliflower rice.   Or, this  Eggplant Lentil Soup. It provides a combination of iron-rich lentils and vitamin C-packed tomatoes.    Serve over steamed greens to boost your iron intake even more!       Eggplant Lentil Soup   Recipe by Jessica Cording, MS, RD, CDN   Ingredients     1 cup dried lentils   2 cups water   1 tablespoon olive oil   1 small onion, diced   2 cloves garlic, minced   1 celery stalk, diced   1 medium carrot, diced   1 medium zucchini, sliced into half-moons   1 medium eggplant, cubed   8 ounces mushrooms, sliced   1 red bell pepper, sliced   Dried oregano to taste   Dried basil to taste   Red pepper flakes to taste   Salt and pepper to taste   2 28-ounce cans crushed, peeled or diced tomatoes     Directions     Combine lentils and water in a small saucepan and bring to a boil.

Liver: It’s What’s for Dinner
Internal animal organs, known as offal, can be found in many dishes closely identified with a worldly region.",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/July-2014/Liver-Its-Whats-for-Dinner/,"This featured post is by  Bethany Grzesiak, MS, RD . You can follow this blogger  @BthnyJane15 .   In American culture, the mention of organ meat does not typicallyevoke a mouth-watering response. Yet internationally, carnivores across the globe don't hesitate to devour this edible animal tissue, often considering it to be a delicacy. Internal animal organs, known as offal, can be found in many dishes closely identified with a worldly region.   When in Scotland, for example, you can fuel up on haggis, a savory pudding made from, among other ingredients, sheeps heart, liver and lungs. In France, a small snack could include  foie gras , or fatty duck liver. Rather than wasting sources of calories and nutrients, chefs throughout history became creative and learned to prepare every ounce of the hunted animal.   However, recent controversy over the safety of offal consumption has become a hot topic.   On one side, many medical experts (and grandmothers alike) tout the benefits of consuming offal. Take one of the more well-known edible organ meats: liver. One 4-oz. serving of beef liver contains 155 calories, 4g total fat, and a whopping 23g protein. It's also a good source of copper, folic acid, iron and B vitamins, as well as one of the most concentrated sources of vitamin A. The National Institute of Health even lists liver as a meat option that, when eaten moderately, may be beneficial to treat anemia.   Comparatively, a 4-oz. ground beef patty (80% lean/20% fat) provides 280 kcal, 22g fat and 19g protein. The ground beef contains many of the same micronutrients but, when placed side by side, the liver appears to be the more nutritious choice.   The other side of the debate brings other facts to light. Most notably, the seemingly healthful high concentration of vitamin A found in animal liver can be a fatal side effect if over-consumed. The active form of vitamin A, known as retinol, can build up to a toxic level within the body. To put it in perspective, one ounce of beef liver contains 8,881 IU vitamin A. The recommended upper limit for males and females older than 19 years is 3,000 IU. Other side effects of vitamin A toxicity (Hypervitaminosis A) include nausea, skin and hair changes, bone pain or swelling and birth defects.   Current cattle-raising methods offer a new source of controversy. Two main functions of an animal liver include detoxifying chemicals and metabolizing drugs. There is building concern over the method of injecting American cattle with growth hormone to produce a larger product yield. Since the liver acts as a filter, the concern is that consuming this organ will expose our bodies to larger quantities of hormone than we would get by only eating animal muscle.   All in all, the debate over the safety and health benefits of liver seems to lead to the same conclusion as many other of our decadent favorites: eat in moderation. The nutritional value of your total diet will determine if eating liver is actually beneficial, so be mindful of all the foods you choose to eat. If the flavor is one you enjoy, be careful not to go overboard, since there are known, and deadly, side effects. Young children and pregnant women should take extra caution, since they are at higher risk of vitamin A toxicity.   If you are feeling adventurous here is a simple recipe to try. Enjoy!     Cocktail Party Liver Spread   Recipe developed by Bethany Grzesiak, MS, RD   Ingredients  1 lb. calf liver  3 medium-sized white onions, chopped  2 tablespoons olive oil  3 hard-boiled eggs, shell removed  Salt and pepper to taste   Directions     Lightly season the raw liver with salt and pepper. Place on an oven-sized pan and broil for approximate 4-5 minutes per side.   On the stove-top, saut two onions in the olive oil until clear.   Place the cooked liver and sauted onions in a food processor along with the eggs and one raw onion.   Add salt and pepper to taste. Process until coarsely chopped, then chill.

Savor: Coffee
Epidemiological research is pouring in about coffee’s power to protect against disease",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Spring-2009/Savor-Coffee/,"Nutritional Benefits of Coffee   By Diane Quagliani, MBA, RD  Research on the health benefits of coffee mainly investigates the bean in its brewed beverage form. Some studies suggest higher levels of coffee intake (at least six or seven cups a day) are associated with lower risk for type 2 diabetes. Others show the consumption of coffee may be linked to reduced risk of stroke, several types of cancers including liver, skin, colorectal, breast, oral, pharyngeal and esophageal cancers, and possibly cardiovascular disease (although research on the relationship between coffee and heart disease is somewhat mixed).   Coffee may help boost brain function, too. Drinking at least three cups of coffee a day was associated with slower decline in cognitive abilities in women, probably due to coffees caffeine content. Coffee consumption also is linked to lower risk for Alzheimers disease and Parkinsons disease, possibly by protecting the brains dopaminergic cells against neurotoxicity.   While the reasons for coffees potential health benefits are still brewing, researchers theorize that its rich blend of antioxidants play a strong roleand some studies show protective effects can come from both caffeinated and decaffeinated coffee.In general, study subjects who drink the most java receive the greatest health benefits; however, most adults including pregnant women should limit caffeine to less than 300 mg a day, or about the amount found in three cups of coffee. Of course, the usual cautions apply to those troubled by caffeine jitters, insomnia or gastro-esophageal reflux disease.     Cooking with Coffee   By Serena Ball, MS, RD  More than 800 aroma compounds are associated with coffee, including nutty, earthy, fruity, buttery, chocolaty, cinnamon, caramel, spicy and winey. With so many flavor profiles, coffee pairs perfectly with many foods. Its acidic nature and spicy, smoky flavors make it an ideal ingredient for marinades to tenderize tougher, inexpensive cuts of meat. Using coffee in recipes like pot roast or onion jam add winey, gamy flavors that complement sandwiches and a variety of meats.   Roasted coffee beans are porous and easily absorb moisture and odors lurking in refrigerators and freezers, so store whole beans at room temperature in a ceramic canister for no more than a few weeks. Never refrigerate coffee beans; if necessary, store them very tightly wrapped in the freezer for a couple months, but do not defrost and re-freeze beans since this breaks down oils and impacts flavor. Ideally, you should grind beans just before using, but ground beans may be stored in an airtight container if used within a few days.     Working with Coffee in Food Service   By Mary Kimbrough RD, LD  Its starring role in foodservice settings may be as a beverage, but coffee can turn traditional menu items into upscale versions at a reasonable cost.While some commercial kitchens grind whole coffee beans for service in specialty areas, most facilities use urns or pour-over pots, on-demand brewing systems, or a combinationand which brewing equipment you have is often linked to standing quantity coffee orders.   Shelf-stable and frozen coffees used in on-demand brewing systems are roasted, brewed and concentrated in air-tight packages to preserve delicate flavors and aromas. These liquid instant coffees and espressos work well as ingredients in desserts that contain chocolate or creamy dairy, such as coffee angel food cake or mocha icing. Keep shelf-stable liquid coffees in dry storage for a year. Frozen liquid coffees must be thawed before use, but may be stored frozen for up to a year or several weeks if thawed and refrigerated.   Urns and pour-over pots use ground coffee, which adds a creative twist to beef, pork and chicken when mixed with spices for a rub. Ground coffee packs should be kept in cool, dry storage and opened just prior to use.And try using brewed coffee in barbecue sauces, gravies and marinades for meats, or in baked beans to help build deep, roasted flavors."

The 2013 Farm Bill: What RDs Need to Know
Arguably one of the most important pieces of legislation affecting food security, nutrition and public health in the U.S., the farm bill also can be one of the most confusing. Here are some good-to-know details for understanding its impact on nutrition and health of Americans",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/January-February-2013/The-2013-Farm-Bill-What-RDs-Need-to-Know/,"Arguably one of the most important pieces of legislation affecting food security, nutrition and public health in the U.S., the farm bill also can be one of the most confusing. Here are some good-to-know details for understanding its impact on nutrition and health of Americans.      Background Basics: 5 Facts        It isn't actually named ""the Farm Bill."" In fact, the name changes every time it's reauthorized to reflect the issues it encompasses. The most recent version proposed is called the Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2012.      It is an omnibus law, meaning it addresses multiple issues, including farm assistance, land conservation, food security and nutrition education. While the original purpose of the legislation was to help farmers by increasing crop prices and controlling production, about 50 years ago it started including related issues and interests, such as nutrition supplementation and education programs.      Its reauthorization cycle is irregular  sometimes three years, sometimes five years  and its provisions are rarely set in stone. A new bill amends or suspends provisions of permanent law; reauthorizes, amends or repeals provisions of preceding bills; and adds new provisions for a limited time.      The committees responsible for hashing out farm bill details are the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry and the U.S. House Committee on Agriculture.      It takes a simple majority to pass a farm bill in Congress (218 members of the House and 50 of the Senate). Once a bill passes in both chambers of Congress, it moves to the executive branch (the president).          What It Does: 15 Titles of the Farm Bill     Title I, Commodities   Provides income support to growers of select commodities, including wheat, corn and other feed grains, cotton, rice, oilseeds, peanuts, sugar and dairy.     Title II , Conservation   Provides funding for farm environmental stewardship through programs that improve farm management practices, retire land and protect farmland and other natural resources.     Title III, Agricultural Trade and Food Aid   Funds U.S. agriculture export and international food assistance programs and various World Trade Organization obligations.     Title IV , Nutrition   Covers domestic food and nutrition and commodity distribution programs, such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance and Nutrition Education, as well as purchases of fresh fruit and vegetables in schools and expanded programs for farmers markets and urban gardens.     Title V, Farm Credit   Offers direct and guaranteed loan programs to farmers via two government-related farm lenders, the USDA Farm Service Agency and the Farm Credit System.     Title VI , Rural Development   Funds rural development loan and grant programs, the expansion of rural broadband access, and water infrastructure projects and promotes locally produced agricultural food products.     Title VII , Research   Supports food, nutrition and agricultural research and extension programs, including biosecurity and response, biotechnology and organic production.     Title VIII , Forestry   Funds USDA Forest Service programs that protect forests from threats, restore forests damaged by natural disasters and enhance public benefits from private forests.     Title IX, Energy   Supports the development of biofuel refineries and research and helps farmers, ranchers and rural small businesses purchase renewable energy systems.     Title X, Horticulture and Organic Agriculture   Encourages the production and consumption of fruits, vegetables and nuts and supports organic agriculture.     Title XI, Livestock   Addresses livestock disease prevention and food safety concerns and enhances electronic mandatory livestock reporting.     Title XII , Crop Insurance and Disaster Assistance   Protects farmers from risks associated with adverse weather, weather-related plant diseases and insect infestations.     Title XIII , Commodity Futures   Covers reauthorization of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, an independent agency that regulates commodity futures trading in the U.S.     Title XIV, Miscellaneous   Expands programs to assist limited-resource and socially disadvantaged farmers and addresses rural development, agricultural labor supply and animal welfare.     Title XV, Trade and Taxes   Introduces numerous tax provisions affecting conservation and commodity program payments, timber investment, biofuel production and agricultural income.      Nutrition Provisions        The  Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program  (formerly Food Stamps) establishes a basic safety net by providing monthly benefits to eligible low-income families to enable them to purchase food and alleviate hunger and malnutrition. The farm bill establishes who is eligible for SNAP and addresses program access, benefit levels and other issues. And for every $5 in SNAP benefits, $9 goes into the local economy.      The  SNAP-Ed program  is the education component that empowers SNAP participants to make healthy food choices within a limited budget and choose physically active lifestyles consistent with the current  Dietary Guidelines for Americans  and MyPlate. SNAP-Ed offers innovative and creative ways to engage participants to eat more fruits and vegetables, whole grains and fat-free or low-fat milk products while being physically active and maintaining healthy habits at all ages.      The  Commodity Supplemental Food Programs  provide nutritious US DA foods to improve the health of low-income pregnant women and new mothers, infants, children up to age 6 and elderly people at least 60 years old.     The Emergency Food Assistance Program  is designed to meet the short-term, emergency food needs of low income Americans. The state agencies that manage the program allocate food to church pantries, food banks, soup kitchens, emergency shelters and Community Action Agencies, which distribute it directly to people in need or use it to prepare meals.          Fighting for Food Security and Nutrition Education   Congress has until September 30 to reauthorize the farm bill. On January 23, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid reintroduced Agriculture Reform, Food and Jobs Act of 2012 as one of the several ""privileged, top-priority bills,"" and the upcoming weeks and months will be critical.

"Baby's First Foods: Fantastic Foods for a Healthy Start
Many parents approach introducing solid foods with great anticipation and some anxiety. Read the following advice and stop worrying.",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/September-October-2014/Babys-First-Foods-Fantastic-Foods-for-a-Healthy-Start/,"What foods should I start with? What if my baby has an allergic reaction? How do I know my baby is getting enough important nutrients? Many parents approach introducing solid foods with great anticipation and some anxiety. These are only some of the questions parents ask themselves before the very first solid meal.     By the time they are 6 months old, babies need an additional dietary source of iron and zinc to complement the nutrition they are getting from breast milk or formula. They also may benefit from exposure to a variety of flavors, which has been shown to increase food acceptance as they get older.     Meat, eggs, iron-fortified cereals, beans, lentils, fruits and vegetables are great first foods that can be introduced in any order. Fish also may be introduced at 6 months to enhance dietary variety and provide an additional source of docosahexaenoic acid.     The best first solid food texture for most babies is a thin pure that can be prepared by grinding or blending food until very smooth and then thinning it with breast milk or formula. To make it easier to identify a trigger food in case of an allergic reaction, wait two to three days before introducing a new food and start with single-ingredient pures. Once the food ""passes the test,"" it can be added to other familiar foods to create mixed dishes. Baby food flavors also can be enhanced by adding spices and herbs.     Early on, eating solid meals is an opportunity for a baby to practice eating skills and experience new flavors. Keep starter portions small and only serve more if the baby is still hungry. There is no need to make sure the baby eats a certain amount; in fact, making babies eat more or less than they need may interfere with their ability to self-regulate.     Because babies kept on pured foods for too long tend to have more feeding problems in the future, once the baby has mastered very thin pures, it's time to start thickening them up and introducing lumps. To achieve a lumpier texture, mash food with a fork instead of a blender. Cooked egg yolks and soft raw or cooked fruits and vegetables can be fork-mashed to provide enough challenging texture for the baby to learn new eating skills.     Once the baby learns to handle mashed foods and lumps, you can introduce finger foods. Most babies are ready for finger foods at between 7 months and 9 months. Very soft cooked pieces of stewed meat or meatballs, boiled eggs, omelet, balls of sticky rice, pieces of cooked fish, tofu, cooked or canned beans, strips of toast, and small pieces of soft fruit and vegetables all make nutritious and easy finger foods.     Previous recommendations included delaying the introduction of common allergens such as nuts, tree nuts, fish and seafood, wheat, eggs, dairy and soy until the baby reached 12 months or older. In 2012, however, an expert panel of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology concluded there was no evidence to support delaying these foods past 4 to 6 months, once a baby has safely tolerated a few more traditional solid foods, such as iron-fortified cereal, fruits and vegetables. In fact, by introducing these foods early on, parents may protect their children from developing food allergies in the future.     Parents of children who have experienced eczema or with a strong family history of atopic disease should consult a pediatrician before introducing potentially allergenic foods. Cow's milk is not recommended as a primary drink until 12 months due to its low iron content. Cheese and yogurt, on the other hand, can be safely introduced with other solids. And, while whole nuts present a choking hazard and chopped nuts are too challenging in texture for small babies, nut butters can enhance the nutrition of baby food if mixed into pures or spread on toast as a finger food.

Synopsis of the Diet Plan:  The Actions chapter focuses on simple, sound advice such as drinking more water, eating breakfast, keeping a food journal and walking daily, while the Food Charts section recommends different foods to help improve different health conditions. The Surprising Results section focuses on the authors personal experiences with topics such as oil pulling. The Food Choices chapter includes simple, nutritious recipes for meals, snacks, sauces and seasoning mixes.      Nutritional Pros and Cons:  The author does not have a formal background in nutrition and the content is based on her own experiences in changing her diet and lifestyle. Although many of her claims lack scientific evidence, most of her recommendations are solid. For example, the Food Charts section shows connections between a variety of foods and conditions some that have proven connections and some that do not. However, overall, most of the foods recommended are nutrient-rich foods and therefore provide health benefits, even if they arent the same benefits identified on the charts. The author often refers to removing chemicals from your diet by eating fewer processed foods and attempts to bust myths about healthy foods being too expensive and time-consuming.      Bottom Line:  The book is a strange blend of mostly practical tips based on some unfounded health claims. Most people would benefit from many of the authors suggestions, but may fi nd the science behind her recommendations a bit misleading."

Retro Reimagined
Food & Nutrition looks at six midcentury food innovations and iconic dishes and, with our Stone Soup bloggers, transforms them into creative, contemporary recipes.",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/January-February-2014/Retro-Reimagined/,"Kingmond Young     The arrival of the baby boomer generation accompanied a cultural shift in American lifestyles, including diet. After World War II, Americans embraced speed, portability and convenience over long hours spent in the kitchen, and the decades that followed saw the rise of TV dinners, drive-through restaurants and quick-cooking meals. Not all of these broad changes to the American diet were necessarily healthful; sometimes a gain in efficiency was accompanied by a decline in nutrition.   However, the foods we grow up with often hold a sentimental place at our tables. Food & Nutrition looks at six midcentury food innovations and iconic dishes and, with our Stone Soup bloggers, transforms them into creative, contemporary recipes.   Heinz  Ketchup Packets.  Heinz Ketchup was introduced in 1876, but the first individual foil ketchup packets didnt appear until 1968. Driven by the burgeoning fast food industry, Heinz piped its ketchup into portable packets. Reduced risk of contamination was another benefit of the new packaging.   Pop-tarts.  The name Pop-tart is a play on pop art popularized by Andy Warhols Campbell's Soup Cans in 1962. First tested in Cleveland in 1963, Kelloggs Pop-Tarts originally came in blueberry, apple currant, strawberry and cinnamon flavors.   Granny Smith Apples.  These tart apples originated in Australia in the 1860s, but it would be 100 years before growers in Washington would begin producing Granny Smiths. The Beatles featured this bright green apple as the logo for their record label, Apple Records, founded in 1968.   Instant Coffee.  Popular with World War II vets, instant coffee had a comeback in the 1960s. Before the advent of electric drip coffee brewers in the 1970s, coffee drinkers mostly relied on percolators. Instant coffee appealed to people because it was convenient and fast.   Meatloaf.  Meatloaf was popularized during the Great Depression when meat was often stretched with fillers such as dried bread, crackers or oats. But it was in the 1950s and 1960s that meatloaf took off as a dish that allowed home cooks to demonstrate their creativity. Grocery stores started selling a meatloaf mix comprised of ground pork, ground beef and ground veal.   Jell-O.  In 1964, the slogan Theres always room for Jell-O debuted and Jell-O claimed its title as a light dessert. Jell-O salads and desserts were ubiquitous in the 1950s and 1960s. Simple versions were everyday desserts, while more elaborate mixtures and molds were saved for company or holidays.     Blueberry Chipotle Ketchup   Developed by Alexandra Caspero, MA, RD   Serves 16   Ingredients  1 pound red tomatoes (about 3 large), skinned with seeds removed  12 ounces blueberries  8 ounces tomato paste  1 canned chipotle pepper  2 teaspoons adobo sauce  3 tablespoons brown sugar  2 tablespoons apple cider vinegar   Instructions     Place tomatoes and blueberries into a blender. Puree until smooth. Strain the blueberry and tomato mixture into a medium saucepan using a fine sieve or colander lined with cheesecloth. Use a spatula to remove as much juice as possible, while leaving the blueberry skins behind.   Add the remaining ingredients to the saucepan; whisk and bring to a boil. Stirring often, reduce heat to medium-low and simmer for 30 minutes until thickened. Remove from heat, let cool and return to blender. Puree until smooth.   To store, pour ketchup into a container, cool and refrigerate. For longer storage, funnel hot ketchup into clean mason jars. Wipe rims, apply lids and rings and process in a boiling water bath canner for 20 minutes.       Coffee-Rubbed Pork Tenderloin   Developed by Kristina LaRue, RD   Serves 4   Ingredients  2 tablespoons instant coffee  1 teaspoon garlic powder   teaspoon sea salt  1 teaspoon brown sugar  1 teaspoon chili powder  1 teaspoon ground paprika   teaspoon ground cayenne pepper   teaspoon ground cinnamon  1 pound pork tenderloin  1 tablespoon fig preserves   Instructions     Arrange oven racks for broiling, about 5 inches from top of oven. Preheat oven to 500F and place broiler pan in oven. In a small bowl, whisk together coffee, garlic, salt, sugar and all spices. Liberally coat the pork tenderloin with coffee rub and place in oven on broiler pan. Cook for 20 to 25 minutes, flipping halfway, until meat reaches an internal temperature of 145F. Spread the fig preserves on top of pork with 3 minutes cooking time remaining. Allow pork to rest 5 minutes before slicing. Slice evenly into medallions about 1-inch thick.       Mediterranean Meatless Lentil Loaf   Developed by Brieanna Casperson, DTR   Serves 9   Ingredients   large yellow onion, thinly sliced   18 cup + 2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided  1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar medium eggplant  1 teaspoon lemon juice  2 cups cooked green lentils  10 medium white mushrooms, quartered   cup vegetable broth  1 cup multigrain pita chip crumbs  1 clove garlic, minced   cup + 18 cup reduced-fat feta, divided  2 tablespoons parsley (stems removed), chopped  1 teaspoon dried oregano  116 teaspoon dried nutmeg  2 medium-sized plum tomatoes, diced   Instructions     Prepare the caramelized onions. Coat an 8-inch cast-iron skillet or thick-bottomed saut pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Heat the skillet on medium-high heat until oil begins to shimmer and add onion slices, stirring with a wooden spoon. Cook for 10 minutes, stir intermittently. Reduce heat to medium-low and stir in the balsamic vinegar.   Cook for 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 F.   Cut the eggplant in half lengthwise into 8 strips roughly 2 inches wide and then cut strips widthwise into 8 sections. Place the eggplant pieces onto a parchment paper lined baking sheet. Brush the piece with 1 tablespoon olive oil. Place in oven and bake for 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown and soft. Remove eggplant pieces, place in a bowl, add lemon juice and toss to coat each piece. Combine parsley, diced tomatoes, 18 cup feta in a small bowl. Set both aside.   Adjust oven to 350F. In a food processor or blender, pulse lentils and mushrooms until texture is grainy and roughly combined. Scoop the mixture into a large mixing bowl.

Transfer the lentil loaf contents into a 9 x 5-inch nonstick loaf pan and smooth top with a spatula. Bake for 25 minutes, remove from oven and sprinkle nutmeg, and tomato, parsley and feta mix evenly over the top. Return to oven and bake for 5 more minutes. Remove and let loaf rest for 15 to 30 minutes or until it feels firm enough to slice.       Indian-spiced Apple Tarts   Developed by Natalia Stasenko, MS, RD, CDN   Serves 6   Ingredients   Pastry  2 cups whole-wheat flour, plus extra for dusting   teaspoons salt  23 cup cold vegan butter, cubed  3 tablespoons cold water   Filling  1 pound Granny Smith apples, peeled and chopped into 13-inch cubes  2 tablespoons sugar  12 teaspoon each of ground cinnamon, ground cardamom and ground ginger, combined (1 teaspoon of the mix is for the filling,  teaspoon is for the icing)  2 tablespoons water   Icing  1 cup powdered sugar   teaspoon spice mix   tablespoon vegan butter, melted  1 tablespoon soy milk   Instructions     Preheat oven to 350F and line a baking sheet with parchment paper.

From Bamm-Bamm Rubble to ""Yum Yum"": Is the Paleo Diet OK for Children?
A recent book's controversy has led many to wonder: Can children go Paleo? If so, at what age and what are the considerations? ",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/April-2015/Is-the-Paleo-Diet-OK-for-Children/,"This featured post is by  Angela Lemond, RDN, CSP, LD . You can follow this blogger  @LemondNutrition .   In mid-March 2015, a controversial baby book  from Australia was pulled before its release. The reason? The book, called  Bubba Yum Yum: The Paleo Way , advised parents of how to feed their children a Paleo diet, and featured a DIY infant formula made from bone broth, oils and probiotics that could have a toxic cocktail of vitamin A.   The three authors of this book are Charlotte Carr, an actress and voice artist; Pete Evans, a chef and health coach; and Helen Pandarin, who calls herself a naturopath, nutritionist and medical herbalist. None of them report any background credentials in pediatric nutrition. For those of us who  do  have pediatric nutrition specialties, we know that infants, toddlers and children have unique nutrition needs that are quite different from those of adults.   This controversy has led many to wonder: Can children go Paleo? If so, at what age and what are the considerations?   What Is the Paleo Diet?   In the 1970s Walter Voegtlin, a gastroenterologist, wrote  The Stone Age Diet , a book which claimed that because humans are carnivorous beings with roots in the Paleolithic period, modern humans' diets should primarily consist of meat and fat with very little carbohydrate. Dr. Voegtlin treated many of his patients that had inflammatory bowel disease and irritable bowel syndrome with good results using this dietary approach.   Flash forward to year 2002, when Loren Cordain, PhD, revived the diet in  The Paleo Diet , a book that mimics some ofDr. Voegtlin's opinions on the way humans should eat. Dr. Cordain is an advocate for leaner meat and less fat than Dr. Voegtlin, and Dr. Cordain seems to promote fruits and vegetables more with a total carbohydrate amount varying between 22 to 40 percent. Dr. Cordain's diet also promotes eating whole foods and prohibits dairy, soy, refined sugars, legumes (including peanuts), potatoes, grains, refined vegetable oils, processed foods and added salt.   The Paleo Diet for Infants and Children   Bubba Yum Yum  was not published, so I can't tell you exactly what's in the book. However, one of the authors, Charlotte Carr, has an active website and blog where she publishes recipes and advice for mothers. I do  not  recommend parents utilize this website for  any  advice. She may be a great actress and loving mother with the best intentions, but she is no nutrition expert.   So, who arethe authoritieson Paleo and what do they say?Dr. Cordain does have some respectable education credentials, but his background is primarily in exercise physiology and he bases most of his recommendations on adult weight management and wellness. He is not a pediatric expert and certainly not a pediatric nutrition expert.   Even still, I opened my mind, visited ThePaleoDiet.com and downloaded a  newsletter that discussed child nutrition . In the recommendations in ""The Paleo Diet's Insider,"" he recommends:     Waiting to wean from breast-feeding as long as possible  at least untilababy is a 1-year-oldand even better if he or she is weaned at 18 months.   Baby foods should be mainly beef, pork and chicken.He acknowledges that a babys liver has trouble with a protein level of greater than 30 to 40 percent, so he advises higher-fat meats to balance the protein amounts in their diets.   If grains are given, he recommends rice over oats or wheat.   He does not advise completely restricting processed food from children because eating involves behavioral issues.I think Dr. Cordain is onto something there (more on that later).     Overall, Dr. Cordains guidance was fairly vague, so it makes it somewhat difficult to assess objectively.   Nutrition Adequacy for Children   In order to meet the vitamin and mineral needs on a Paleo diet, according to Dr.Cordain, one must consume a large amount of plant-based foods. Those foods must be varied and eaten in adequate quantities in efforts to achieve those needs. You can intellectualize that with willing adults, but its not as easy with children. I am a mother and practitioner who sees children in my practice daily. I know we must have options and carry those food options out with appropriate structure and guidance.   Even if we can get our young children to consume a high plant-based diet, it brings up another issue of excessive fibers risk of achieving adequate total energy requirements along with the bioavailability of vital minerals such as calcium, iron and zinc ( see Special Considerations for Infant Feeding, USDA, p. 137 ).    Children also utilize carbohydrates for growth. According to the Institute of Medicine's Adequate Intake recommendations, infants from 6 to 12 months of age increase their carbohydrate needs up to 60 percent of their calories from carbohydrate foods, including a varied amount of grain-based foods to meet those needs  along with adequate calories. This is all assuming that the mother is producing enough breast milk and is able to breast-feed for at least one year. But according to the  latest data from the CDC , only 49 percent of infants are breast-fedat 6 months, and only 27 percent at 1yearold. This statistic alone disqualifies most babies from going Paleo. For those successfully breast-feeding mothers, I still caution parents very strongly aboutfollowing Paleo for kids as it seriously restricts carbohydrates in the diet, which are needed to promote adequate growth for children.   Behavioral Aspects of Paleo   Food restrictions of any kind for children cause social ramifications. How do you deal with children at school? At birthday parties? In my practice, we teach families how to eliminate certain foods after a medical diagnosis of a food allergy or intolerance. If you ask any of those families, they would give anything to avoid the social and logistical challenges of their required eliminations. And that happens when even just one food is eliminated. The Paleo diet is extremely restrictive and the social and behavioral aspects can have serious psychological implications for your child. Even Lorrie Cordain, MEd, of The Paleo Team (a.k.a., Dr. Cordains wife) talks about the effects of over-restriction and rigidity with childrens diet and its ramifications.   Bottom Line   The Paleo approach continues to be a very popular way of eating for many adults, and its popularity does not seem to be waning anytime soon. But its restrictive treatment of carbohydrates and promotion of protein make it behaviorally and nutritionally challenging. I do not advise parents to put their children on a Paleo diet.

"How Can Restaurants Attract Baby Boomers?
Working later in life and delaying retirement gives boomers more discretionary income, and some empty nesters may prefer not to cook full meals at home as often.",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/January-February-2014/How-Can-Restaurants-Attract-Baby-Boomers/,"ISTOCKPHOTO.COM       Restaurateurs have long tried to woo younger customers, particularly those in the 18- to 24-year-old age bracket. But new research shows that its actually the baby boomers who are driving sales. According to a study last year by market research firm NPD Group Inc., baby boomers have increased their share of restaurant traffic by 6 percentage points while millennials have decreased their traffic share by the same amount. Working later in life and delaying retirement gives boomers more discretionary income, and some empty nesters may prefer not to cook full meals at home as often.     The boomer generation is adventurous and will try new foods, especially healthy options and menu items that are perceived as a good value, but dining establishments must offer impeccable service to win this crowd over. Boomers want to feel special  like they are part of a community, says Cindy Heilman, MS, DTR, author of Hospitality for Boomers: How to Attract Residents, Retain Staff, and Maximize Profitability (Cindy Heilman 2012). Servers should be trained to greet people with warmth, kindness and generosity.     Training staff so that they can field questions competently and truly make baby boomers feel welcome should be a priority. Highly successful restaurants train their staff to make the connection, says Heilman. [Boomers] need to feel as if the server or host truly wants them to be there and to feel welcome. Customers should leave in a better mood than when they came in.     Attract and retain baby boomer clientele by following these best practices:        Greet baby boomers warmly and seat them in a quieter section away from the kitchen door, service stations or bathrooms.      Make sure the dining area is adequately lit and keep the noise level low enough to foster conversation. Easy-to-read menus and comfortable seating are must haves.      Staff should know the menu inside and out and be prepared to answer diners questions. Prep staff to field questions about food allergies, dietary restrictions and portion sizes. A confident staff leads to good service and happy diners.      Offer healthy but tasty menu items. Guests in this age bracket appreciate menus with smaller portion sizes and vegetarian, gluten-free, low-fat and low-sodium options. Be prepared to offer modifications or substitutions to help diners enjoy their meal while meeting health requirements.      Baby boomers enjoy the classics, but theyre also adventurous and enjoy trying the new spices and flavors in ethnic cuisines.      Boomers enjoy getting a bargain, but they will pay more for high-quality, local or organic foods. Baby boomers are loyal customers and want to be rewarded for that loyalty. A free glass of wine or complimentary dessert acknowledges that their repeat business is always welcome. Offer deals, coupons or discounts to retain loyal customers and attract new ones."

"Nutrition for a Breastfeeding Mom
With some pre-baby planning and smart shopping, energy and milk supplies can be better for mom and baby.",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/October-2014/Nutrition-for-a-Breastfeeding-Mom/,"This featured post is by  Gina Lesako, RD, LD . You can follow this blogger  @GLesako .   10/28/2014: This blog post was edited to include certain references and updated content. Updated content is in bolded text.   Breastfeeding has a host of nutritional benefits that will promote your childs health and growth. It also takes a toll on the mothers nutritional stores and energy. But with some pre-baby planning and smart shopping, energy and milk supplies can be better for mom and baby. Here are some tips:   Calories and Fluid   The average woman needs anywhere from 1,500-2,000 calories, based on activity level. Nursing moms need more: 2,000-2,500 calories (more if nursing twins) daily, along with at least 108-oz. glasses of water. To make up a 500-calorie deficit, consider a few healthy choices that will also help with weight loss over time:     Two tablespoons of peanut butter has 200 calories and 7 g protein.   One small container of full-fat Greek yogurt can have 180 calories and 15 g protein.   Adding two tablespoons of full-fat balsamic dressing to a salad with half an avocado will add an additional 300 calories.   Avoid sugary drinks (juices, carbonated beverages) and sweets, as this will slow down on some of the postpartum weight loss.      Proper hydration is also crucial for nursing mothers. ChooseMyPlate.gov recommendsdrinking enough fluids, especially water, to quench your thirst.   Nutrients   Calcium consumption is crucial for both nursingmothers and their babies.  Mother can obtainthis nutrient in foods such asdairy products, non-dairy fortified products (almond or soy milk), fish, dark leafy greens, fortified cereals and tofu. New moms should stock up on fortified cereals as they are shelf-stable and consider using frozen leafy greens to add to omelets, pastas and soups.   Iron   Iron is crucial during the postpartum period. Doctors will usually test for iron and recommend supplementation if necessary, but the following foods will help with improving iron stores: fortified cereals, oysters, lean beef, tofu and spinach (when combined with an acid such as citrus or vinegar). Also, consider avoiding coffee, teasand legumes while consuming iron-rich foods as these can block iron absorption.    Caffeine   Sleepless nights and depleted iron stores make for exhausted parents. Coffee to the rescue? Excessive consumption of caffeine (three or more cups per day) may affect the breastfeeding infant. However, a morning cup of coffee is acceptable during breastfeeding. Keep in mind that the later you drink coffee the later its in the breast milk, which might keep baby up later.    Seafood   Low-mercury fish can be eaten twice a week. Good options are cod, haddock, pollock, shrimp, tilapia and light tuna. Farm-raised salmon can be eaten twice a month along with herring and sardines, but keep in mind they contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which, in high numbers, can cause neurological problems and development delays in babies.   Alcohol   Once the baby is on an established breastfeeding schedule, around age three months, mom may have a chance to imbibe. Alcohol passes into breast milk so  ChooseMyPlate.gov recommendspumping or breastfeeding before having a drink. Or, waitfour hours after drinking before pumping or nursing to ensure the alcoholis completely out of the mothers system.

You can follow this blogger  @TheSpicyRD .   Around this time last year, the kids and I had an adventure. We drove out of the big city and along the windy countryside roads, past orange trees, horse farms and avocado orchards, until we arrived at one of my favorite haunts from childhood this time of year  Bates Nut Farm.   Apart from the time my daughter was an infant (which Im pretty sure she doesnt remember), I dont think my kids had ever been to a real pumpkin patch.   We loaded two wheelbarrows full of bumpy pumpkins, white pumpkins, mini pumpkins, jack-o-lanterns, cinderella pumpkins, and even some handsome turban squash.   We also included one of my favorites, sweet acorn squash.   Drizzled with a little olive oil, sprinkled with salt and pepper, and roasted in the oven for 30 minutes, acorn squash is delicious enough on its own, but stuff it with quinoa pilaf loaded with pumpkin seeds, toasted almonds, tart cherries, sauteed onions, baby spinach and fresh oregano, and you have taken it to a whole new level of deliciousness!     Acorn Squash Stuffed with Pumpkin Seed & Cherry Quinoa Pilaf   Recipe by EA Stewart, MBA, RD   Serves 2   Ingredients  1 acorn squash  2 teaspoons olive oil, plus additional for drizzling on squash  salt and fresh ground pepper to taste  1/2 cup uncooked quinoa, rinsed  1 cup water  1 cup finely chopped yellow onion  1/4 cup sliced almonds  1/2 cup roasted pumpkin seeds  1/4 cup dried tart cherries, chopped  2 cups baby spinach, chopped  1 tablespoon fresh oregano, chopped   Instructions     Pre-heat oven to 350 degrees F. Meanwhile, cut acorn squash in half, vertically, and remove the seeds. Drizzle olive oil over the flesh of both pieces of squash, then sprinkle with salt and fresh ground pepper. Place squash flesh side down on a foil-lined sheet and bake for 30 minutes.   While squash is baking, combine quinoa and water in a medium pan. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and cook until water is absorbed and quinoa is nice and fluffy.   While quinoa is cooking, heat olive oil in a pan, then add onions and cook until translucent. Push onions to the side of the pan, and add almonds, stirring constantly for a couple of minutes to toast. Remove pan from heat and set aside.   When quinoa is done cooking, pour it into a medium bowl, then stir in onion/almond mixture, pumpkin seeds, cherries, spinach and oregano. Season with salt and pepper to taste.   When squash is cooked, remove from oven and place each piece on a plate. Scoop 3/4 cup of quinoa pilaf mixture into each squash half and serve.     Notes: You will have about 1 cup of quinoa pilaf mixture left over. Store in refrigerator, and serve as a cold quinoa salad the next day.     Enjoy, and have the happiest of Halloweens!!!

5 Reasons You Should Use a Slow Cooker in Summer
Oh baby, it's hot outside! In summer's grip, grilling is always a good answer to the question, ""What's for dinner?"" But it can start to get old after a while. So then what?",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/July-2015/5-Reasons-You-Should-Use-a-Slow-Cooker-in-Summer/,"This featured post is by  Anne Danahy, MS, RD, LDN .   Oh baby, it's hot outside!  Who wants to even think about thestove or oven when you could be cooling off at the beach or pool? Grilling is always a good answer to the question, ""What's for dinner?"" But even thatcan start to get old after a while.So, then what?Try dusting off your favorite winter kitchen accessory  the slow cooker  for some summer fun.   I gave away my old slow cooker years ago, but recently bought a new one because I realized how handy they really are: time saving and a nice way to mix up your meals when you're tired of your usual summer fare!   Although I agree the thought of beef stew or a hearty soup isn't terribly appealing in July, there is so much more to explore with slow cookers in summer.   Turn Off the Heat   If you start to sweat just thinking about preheating the oven when it's 95 degrees outside, a slow cooker can step in to save the day. As long as you do a bit of advance planning, you can roast a chicken, cook a pot roast or bake some beans, a frittata or even a cake. Just remember to plan your menu early in the day so you get a good start. Most slow cooker recipes take anywhere from twoto eighthours, but the bonus is that they're hands off and heat-free.   Cook It Once and Eat All Week   With all the fun plans you've made, summer is just way too short to be stuck inside cooking! Use the slow cooker to cook a few pounds of chicken breast on Monday and shred it to use in chicken tacos; on Tuesday, makeAsian stir-fry; and on Wednesday, makechicken salad. Cooked chicken lasts for three to four days when refrigerated properly, so you might even be able to squeeze out a Thursday mealof barbecue pulled-chicken sandwiches from that one day of cooking! Less time in the kitchen can make summer feel just a little bit longer.   Breakfast Is Ready   A hearty breakfast saves the day when the kids have long days at camp, or your agenda involves a full schedule of hiking, biking or swimming. Step aside cold cereal, because slow-cooker breakfasts (such asegg-and-vegetable frittata, baked oatmeal with fruit and nuts, or even huevos rancheros casserole) are where you'll find the long-lasting fuel. As a bonus, you can prepare these breakfast meals the night before and they'll be ready to grab and go when you are.   Dessert Can Be Healthier   Enjoy fresh summer fruit by slow-roasting stone fruits and fresh berries with a few slices of fresh ginger or a vanilla pod in the slow cooker. Skip the chocolate syrup and sprinkles  top frozen yogurt with anamazing summer fruit compote.   Save Money and DIY   Pre-cooked, packaged and frozen whole grains are a great time saver, but why not try making your own? Cook several cups of longer-cooking grains, such aswheat berries or farro, in the slow cooker, cool on a cookie sheet and freeze in freezer bags. Instant whole grains!

French Bread Pizza with Herbed Ricotta, Spinach & Tomatoes
Whole-wheat baguette brushed with garlic-infused olive oil then topped with ricotta cheese, herbs, baby spinach, sliced tomatoes and shredded Italian cheese make this tasty French Bread Pizza. ",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Blog/The-Cutting-Board/June-2015/French-Bread-Pizza-with-Herbed-Ricotta-Spinach-Tomatoes/,"This featured post is by Sara Haas, RDN, LDN. You can follow this blogger  @cookinRD .   We all love pizza, but sometimes we crave something a little different. Enter the French bread pizza. Yes, French bread pizza tends to be a pretty traditional dish, honoring the age-old combination of marinara sauce, sausage and melted mozzarella cheese. But why not redefine the French bread pizza in a simple, new way? My version of French bread pizza with herbed ricotta, spinach and tomatoes is just that, an updated, fun way to enjoy a classic.   To make this pizza, start with a fresh whole-wheat baguette. Slice it and brush it with a garlic-infused olive oil. After a little toasting in the oven, top it with low-fat ricotta thats been combined with thyme and oregano. Then add a layer of fresh spinach, sliced tomatoes and a dusting of shredded cheese. Bake until the cheese is melted to perfection and serve it with a side of marinara sauce for dipping.   Not only does this turn a simple dish into a sophisticated one, but it can also be a more nutritious way to enjoy pizza. Choose a whole wheat baguette for the base. This way youll get more whole grains which equals more nutrition in the way of vitamins, minerals and fiber. Then add plenty of nutritious flavor with fresh garlic and herbs. Finally, top it all with fresh spinach (loaded with iron, B vitamins and vitamin C) and ripe, red tomatoes (a nutritious source of vitamins A and C as well as the powerful antioxidant lycopene.)   Food Safety Tip: This is agreat meal for a crowd, but just like other food you serve at parties, keep track of how long its been sitting out on thebuffet table. Set a timer to go off when 2 hours have passed. After that, the food is no longer considered safe to eat. Better yet, set the timer for 1 1/2 hours and notify your guests when it goes off that last call on the pizza has been issued.             French Bread Pizza with Herbed Ricotta, Spinach and Tomatoes   Recipe by Sara Haas, RDN, LDN   Ingredients     1 tablespoon olive oil   1 clove garlic, finely minced (a fine grater works well here)   1 loaf whole wheat baguette (about 12-16 ounces)    cup low-fat ricotta cheese    teaspoon dried thyme leaves    teaspoon dried oregano    teaspoon salt   4 cups baby spinach leaves, washed   1 1/2 cups shredded Italian blend cheese or mozzarella cheese   1 cup marinara sauce, warmed     Directions     Preheat the oven to 350F and line a sheet pan with foil.   Combine the olive oil and the garlic in a small bowl and stir to combine. Set aside.   Cut the baguette in half horizontally. Then cut each piece in half lengthwise. Place the sliced bread on the sheet pan.   Using a pastry brush, brush the oil and garlic mixture on the cut side of each piece of bread. Place in the oven and cook for 10 minutes.   Remove the pan from the oven. Increase the oven temperature to 400F.   Spread the ricotta evenly over the top of each piece of bread. Sprinkle with thyme, oregano and salt. Cover the top of each piece with spinach leaves and tomato slices. Sprinkle with shredded cheese and return to the oven. Bake an additional 10-12 minutes or until cheese is melted and golden and bubbly.   Remove pizzas from the pan and serve with warmed marinara sauce for dipping.

Besting Breastfeeding Bullies: A Case for Supporting, Not Shaming
Has the ""breast is best"" mantra gone too far in perpetuating these feelings among women who cannot, or choose not, to breastfeed?",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/September-October-2014/Besting-Breastfeeding-Bullies-Support-Not-Shame/,"""Breast is best"" has long been the mantra to new mothers and is a favorite among many registered dietitian nutritionists.     There's no shortage of good reasons for moms to breastfeed their infants; numerous studies point to the nutritional and health benefits of breast milk, including reduced risk of ear infections, sudden infant death syndrome, obesity and respiratory illness, as well as improved maternal outcomes such as a reduced risk of ovarian and breast cancer, Type 2 diabetes and postpartum depression.     For some mothers, however, breastfeeding isn't an option  either because they can't breastfeed or they choose to formula-feed instead. And many of these moms report feeling shame and guilt about their situation.     Has the ""breast is best"" mantra gone too far in perpetuating these feelings among women who cannot, or choose not, to breastfeed?     Too Much Pressure?   ""Bullies"" may be a strong label to those who passionately believe that breast milk is the best food for babies  and in most cases, it is likely an unfair depiction of many breastfeeding advocates.     La Leche, an organization that fervently promotes breastfeeding via mother-to-mother support, is sometimes cited as one of the ""extremist"" breastfeeding groups. Although its approach may seem dogmatic to some, La Leche was founded in 1956 when formula was the go-to choice for mothers, and has dedicated the past 58 years to promoting the benefits of breastfeeding.     Over the years, campaigns and programs to boost breastfeeding among new mothers have been largely successful.     Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2014 Breastfeeding Report Card shows that more than three-quarters of moms begin breastfeeding their infant. Yet despite these promising stats, a study published in 2013 in Pediatrics found first-time moms who report problems and concerns with breastfeeding during the first few days after giving birth are nearly 10 times as likely to quit breastfeeding within two months.     Those findings aren't surprising to Ginger Carney, MPH, RD, LDN, IBCLC, FILCA, FAND, director of clinical nutrition and lactation consultant at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. ""It takes a village for a woman to successfully breastfeed,"" says Carney, noting there are many barriers that make breastfeeding more difficult than it has to be.     ""Some of these barriers start in the birth hospital when moms and babies are separated, or when formula is provided to mothers who are breastfeeding,"" she says. ""Other barriers that occur later include unwelcome looks when moms try to feed their babies in public or when new moms return to work and need to find a private place to pump.""     Much of Carney's work with new mothers is centered on dispelling myths and providing women with the education and tools to work around these barriers.     Katie Mulligan, MS, RDN, LDN, is an extension service dietitian at the University of Rhode Island whose own experience changed her perspective of formula. Trying to ""do the right thing"" by breastfeeding resulted in the hospitalization of her 5-day-old daughter while Mulligan waited for her milk to come in. With the help of a lactation consultant, Mulligan used formula to supplement her breast milk. ""You think that breastfeeding is natural. No one tells you that breastfeeding can be incredibly hard and heart-wrenching, and that you feel like the world's worst mom when it doesn't work out,"" Mulligan says.     Many other new moms agree; a 2012 study found that 43 percent of first-time mothers feel guilty about using formula instead of breastfeeding. ""My opinion was definitely different before I had a child,"" Mulligan says. ""Now I am much more open to formula as a perfectly good option for babies.""     Less Judgment, More Support   Babies not latching on properly, concerns over quantity of breast milk and pain during breastfeeding are typical situations that certified lactation consultant Freda Rosenfeld, IBCLC, encounters in her work with new moms. ""I'd say that in 80 percent of cases, I'm successful in helping women achieve their nursing goals,"" says Rosenfeld, adding that the operative phrase is their nursing goals.     While in an ideal world all women might exclusively nurse, Rosenfeld is also pragmatic: Medical conditions, use of medications, returning to work, fatigue and other factors influence how much, how long and if ever a woman can breastfeed, or if the addition of formula is needed. Each mother's goals, options and situations are different; important points for RDNs to consider and remember when counseling new mothers.     ""My belief is that every woman should first and foremost be educated about breastfeeding, and those who want to breastfeed should be helped to be successful,"" Rosenfeld says. ""But no one should ever be made to feel guilty about their choice or circumstance.""     Elizabeth Ward, MS, RD, author of  Expect the Best: Your Guide to Healthy Eating Before, During & After Pregnancy  (Wiley 2009) couldn't agree more. ""Women need support for their decisions, not pressure or shame,"" says Ward. ""Being happy is the greatest gift you can give your baby, and if that means no breastfeeding and using formula instead, then that's the best choice.""     But sometimes, that's easier said than done. Like many moms-to-be, Massachusetts-based dietitian Dianne Rishikof, MS, RDN, LDN, always assumed that she would breastfeed, but medical issues thwarted her plans. A conversation with her cousin  a pediatrician who holds a strong ""breast milk only"" stance  left her devastated and feeling like a failure. While reassurance from both her own doctor and pediatrician that using formula would not harm her baby's health helped ease her worries and anxiety, the seesaw feelings of guilt continued for months, perpetuated in part by parenting books she read.     Only after her son turned 6 months old and it was clear that he was nourished, healthy and attached to her did Rishikof come to terms with her circumstances. ""I am at peace with this choice that was taken away from me, but I still feel like I need to say 'for medical reasons' whenever I talk about bottle feeding my kids,"" says Rishikof. ""And that need for defensive justification speaks volumes to the pressure or judgment that I must still feel.""     Mulligan has spoken out against the pressures mothers face feeling like they are failures if they don't breastfeed and has found support among fellow RDNs, for the most part. However, she says, ""There are dietitians who think we should 'warn mothers of the dangers of formula'  that's an exact quote  and that type of thinking does nothing but harm, to the mother and to you, as a health professional.""     Using formula to feed a baby is sometimes a conscious choice and other times a decision that's out of a mother's control. Either way, health professionals' roles are to provide less judgment and more support and encouragement  and, of course, science-based nutrition education free from personal bias.

Does Celiac Disease Cause Infertility?
It’s commonly known that around 1 percent of the population has celiac disease — a severe autoimmune reaction to gluten — and we often think of it as a gastrointestinal disorder. But celiac is four to eight times more common in women who are experiencing infertility without any other known cause",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/April-2013/Does-Celiac-Disease-Cause-Infertility/,"This featured post is by  Cheryl Harris, MPH, RD . You can follow this blogger  @CherylHarrisRD .       Infertility is one of the hardest things for couples who want children, and celiac disease is frequently an overlooked cause.     Its commonly known that around 1 percent of the population has  celiac disease   a severe autoimmune reaction to  gluten   and we often think of it as a gastrointestinal disorder. But celiac is four to eight times more common in women who are experiencing infertility without any other known cause.This is a particularly tricky issue, because many of these women are not experiencing any of the typical celiac tummy troubles, and most dont even have anemia, which is often the most visible sign of celiac.     Many doctors now suggest screening for celiac when there isnt another obvious cause for infertility. Its also a much simpler and less invasive test than many of the infertility procedures. If youre reading this, most likely celiac already is on your radar screen, but you know as well as I do that this isnt universal. Since theres such a genetic link involved, if you have family members who are experiencing infertility or miscarriages, or if you know people experiencing infertility, do consider passing this information along! (Gently, of course, to people who you think might be open to it.)     Whats Causing the Infertility?     With untreated celiac disease, every time the mom-to-be eats gluten, her body attacks the small intestine, which often causes nutritional deficiencies. Obviously this makes it harder to get pregnant and to have a healthy pregnancy. The nutrients people with celiac arent absorbing well are the same ones that grow babies: such as iron, vitamin D, B vitamins, zinc, magnesium, calcium, etc.     But theres more than that. An untreated autoimmune disease  even without  nutrient deficiencies isnt good for mom or baby. The same tissue transglutaminase antibodies that doctors look at to identify active celiac disease and how patients are responding to a  gluten-free  diet can actually interfere with pregnancy. According to Daniel Leffler, MD, MS, director of clinical research at the Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, It turns out that antibodies affect the placenta in negative ways. We thought they were just good diagnostic markers, but they also seem to bind to and wreak havoc on many areas of the body.     This also means that moms-to-be will have the best chance of a healthy pregnancy if they wait six months or until the tTg (tissue transglutaminase) levels are back to normal and nutritional deficiencies are corrected. Because, at the end of the day, the goal is not just getting pregnant, but having a happy, healthy baby.     Dont Forget Dad     We tend to focus on the mom, but if the dad has untreated celiac,  he  may be the cause of infertility. Vitamins A and E and zinc are critical to sperm production. And one study even showed that fathers with untreated celiac were five times more likely to have low-birth weight babies.     Smart Steps and Tips     So, if you want to get pregnant and have celiac disease, make sure youve checked with your doctor about nutritional deficiencies and your thyroid, too. People with celiac are more likely to have autoimmune thyroid diseases, too, such as Hashimotos or Graves, which often show up during and after pregnancy.     Its also critical to make sure youre eating a balanced diet. Most  gluten-free  products arent fortified the way regular products are, and  many are both higher calorie and higher in empty, starchy carbs , too. The nutrients that are low in the diets of women with on a gluten-free diet (iron, B vitamins, calcium, fiber) are needed by both mom and baby.     Snacks can be the hardest, because its typical to reach for whatever is lying around. But for most people who eat gluten-free, a little planning goes a long way. Chopped fruits and veggies like carrots, celery, peppers, etc. are wonderful foods to pack and go. Nuts and seeds are always perfect options because they are shelf-stable. When refrigeration isnt an issue, a yogurt or a cheese stick works well.     Want to learn more? Check out these sources:        Shah S, Leffler D.

"Saving Lives in the Sahel
A program to encourage exclusive breastfeeding in Niger hopes to cut child mortality",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/September-October-2014/Saving-Lives-in-the-Sahel/,"On scorching days in Niger, it is not uncommon for a mother to give water to her infant. After all, she is thirsty so her baby must be, too. But in a nation where sanitation is poor and clean water a rarity, this maternal instinct can be life-threatening to infants by introducing a risk of diarrhea  one of the primary causes of neonatal deaths.     In Niger, 3 million children under the age of 5 years die annually. Since 2008, UNICEF, the Nigerien government and other nongovernmental organizations have developed initiatives addressing infant and child mortality in this desert country where up to 30 percent of children being treated as inpatients for chronic malnutrition are under 6 months old. A key element of the program's eight Essential Family Practices is exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months of life, as recommended by the World Health Organization.     While most mothers in Niger breastfeed, it is the exclusive element that the program encourages. No matter the nutritional state of the mother, nursing women are able to produce nutritious, safe milk. Moreover, breast milk adjusts to environmental changes and babies' needs. So when it's extremely hot, as it often is in Saharan Niger, the foremilk is more watery  which hydrates and slakes thirst.     ""The [mortality] prevention program has a strong infant and young child feeding promotion and counseling component,"" says Fitsum Assefa, UNICEF's chief of nutrition in Niger. ""Promotion activities take place both at health facilities when children come for treatment or preventive services, and also at community and household levels using community health workers and mothers' support groups.""     So far, the program is showing success with rates of exclusive breastfeeding in Niger increasing from 14 percent in 2006 to 23 percent in 2012. Its target is to align with the WHO's universal goals to increase the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in infants up to 6 months by at least 50 percent by 2025.     According to  The Lancet , if every mother breastfed their infants exclusively and immediately, Nigerien child mortality could be reduced by as much as 13 percent. ""No other intervention comes close to that,"" says Assefa.       Kerri-Ann Jennings, MS, RD, is a nutrition consultant and health writer based in Burlington, Vt."
"Fares of Faith: Mawlid un-Nabi
Around the world, many Muslims celebrate the birth of the Islamic Prophet Mohammad with feasts, festivals, street parades, chants and decorations in streets, mosques and homes.",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/January-February-2015/Fares-of-Faith-Mawlid-un-Nabi/,"Around the world, many Muslims celebrate the birth of the Islamic Prophet Mohammad, peace be upon him,* with feasts, festivals, street parades, chants and decorations in streets, mosques and homes.   Mawlid un-Nabi   also referred to as  Eid Al-Mawlid Annabawi  in certain Arabic dialects ( eid  means feast or celebration;  mawlid  means birth and  un-Nabi  means prophet)  is observed by Sunni Muslims on the 12th of  Rabi Al-Awwal , the third month in the Islamic calendar, or on the 17th of the same month by Shiite Muslims. Because the Islamic calendar is lunar, the holiday shifts by about 10 days every year on the Gregorian calendar. This year,  Mawlid al-Nabi  is being celebrated twice in 2015  on January 3 and again on December 23.   Prophet Mohammad (PBUH), the prophet of Islam, was born in A.D. 570 in Mecca, now Saudi Arabia. There are no mentions of celebrations of the Prophets birth during his lifetime; in fact, the first large-scale celebrations took place in 1207 in the city of Irbil, then known as Arabala and located in modern-day Iraq. These were led by the citys Sufi missionaries, who spread the celebrations throughout Egypt during the Fatimid Dynasty. Later that century, the Mamluk Sultans in Egypt ornamented the celebrations by decorating the streets with lamps and silk cloths. Sufi groups and singers performed at Cairos Citadel and gifts were given to soldiers and the poor.   Today,  Mawlid un-Nabi  is an official holiday in 47 Muslim countries, from its Middle Eastern origins to Africa to Malaysia, where the holiday is known as  Maulidur Rasul . The celebrations in Egypt are still the largest in scale in the Middle East and Sufi Muslims continue to be the biggest devotees of this holiday.   Food is distributed to the poor and people gather in mosques and streets to pray, recite the Quran (the Holy book for Muslims) and listen to poetry and songs that praise Prophet Mohammad (PBUH), his life, qualities, accomplishments and teachings. Many Muslims celebrate the day by fasting, or abstaining from food or drinks from dawn until sunset.   Food is an important part of the celebrations. Desserts such as baklava, rice pudding or semolina porridge are offered in countries all over the world. Honey is the sweetener of choice.  Tharid , or  Tharida , a meat and vegetable broth served over crispy bread and thought to be Prophet Mohammads(PBUH) favorite dish, is often served. While it originated in the Arabian Peninsula, the type of meat, spices and vegetables can vary from one region to another, yielding a savory, spicy or sweet meal.   Other foods served during  Mawlid un-Nabi  vary from culture to culture, based on local traditions:     Egypt:  Hummus, sweets and pink colored candies shaped like knights on horses are common (horse candies are also shared in Sudan). Fried fritters called  mshabbak  made of wheat, sugar, butter and eggs are sometimes served in Egypt.   India and Pakistan : Muslims eat spicy rice and meat dishes, as well as sweet rice dishes. While camel meat is considered holiest for the occasion, goat and mutton are more common in that region.   Kenya:  Shrimp pilaf, curried eggplant, cassava with coconut sauce, mango chutney and roasted red pepper may be served as part of the celebrations.   Lebanon and the Middle East:  Here, people may feast on  tabbouleh  and roasted chicken stuffed with rice, spices and ground lamb ( djaj mihshi ). Dessert can be mshabbak or baklava.   North Africa:  Muslims enjoy  Aseeda  (or  Asida ), a dough-based dessert usually eaten warm by hand and made from cooked wheat flour, butter and honey.   Malaysia:  While celebrations and street parades can be massive in Malaysia, specific holiday food is not as emphasized. People often simply enjoy local street foods, and boxed meals may be distributed at the end of the parades.     Further Cultural Competence Notes     Whenever Muslims say or hear the name of the Islamic prophet, they follow it with a salutation known in Arabic as  salawat . In English, the most common of these phrases is Sallah Allahu Alaihi wa Sallam, or peace be upon him, which some Muslims will shorten to the abbreviation PBUH. In fact, Muslims send salutations after the name of any religious prophet, such as Moses or Abraham, by saying, ""Alaihi Alsalatu wa Assalam."" For non-Muslims engaging with Muslim communities, using the phrase peace be upon him after an Islamic prophets name would be considered a gesture of respect, but it would also be understandable if it were omitted since it is not part of the culture of non-Muslims.   Some Muslim groups do not observe  Mawlid un-Nabi , such as Salafi and Wahabi, who believe that since the prophet didn't celebrate his birthday during his life, the should follow suit.

"Microbiome: The Garden Within
The microbial residents of our gut, skin, eyes and nasal passages collectively are referred to as the ""microbiome"" — and research of its role in human health is revealing surprising discoveries",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/May-June-2015/Microbiome-The-Garden-Within/,"For every cell in the human body, there are about 10 nonhuman cells. These microbial residents of our gut, skin, eyes and nasal passages collectively are referred to as the ""microbiome""  and research of its role in human health has revealed enough surprising discoveries that the National Institutes of Health has launched an international Human Microbiome Project.   The human microbiome refers specifically to the community of microorganisms that live in and on the human body (or any ""host"" animal) and their collective genome, which interacts with our host genes. The microbiota (formerly called ""microflora"") refers to the microorganisms themselves. Our microbiota are affected by everything from how we entered the world to how much time we spend barefoot. Bacteria, yeasts, molds, dirt and the types of food we eat all impact microbiota, thereby influencing the microbiome.   Gut bacteria aid digestion by breaking down otherwise indigestible plant fibers into short-chain fatty acids that intestinal cells can access. Emerging research also suggests that gut bacteria influence many other metabolic functions, so much so that some experts now regard it as a ""hidden"" organ system, capable of interacting with its host down to DNA expression. As a result, the microbiome's role in conditions as varied as irritable bowel diseases, obesity, Type 2 diabetes, depression, autoimmune disorders and Parkinson's disease is under intense scientific scrutiny. The core questions remain: How does the microbiome become altered in a way that negatively affects the host, and how does a host build better microbiota?   Establishing the Colony   The bacteria that our immune systems recognize as ""normal"" (the bacteria that will prevail in our guts or the duration of our lives) is established by our first exposure to our mothers' microbial mix. Babies born vaginally are colonized by microbes present in the birth canal, primarily by strains of Lactobacillus species that differ from non-pregnant women. By contrast, babies born via cesarean section are colonized by the microbiota of a mother's skin and whatever other bacteria happen to be present at birth, predominantly Staphylococcus species.   First foods matter as well. Breast milk has its own microbiota that differ depending on whether the mother gave birth vaginally or via C-section, possibly due to the antibiotics women receive before and after C-section delivery. Breast milk contains oligosaccharides that act as prebiotics  food for the infant's developing intestinal community. After birth, infants begin to cultivate their own bacterial mix until the developing microbiota reach a relatively stable state, shaped by environment and diet. By age 2, the child's microbiota are believed to resemble an adult's.   An Evolving System   Our microbiome co-evolves with us and influences our metabolism, physiology, nutrition and immune function. Once the microbiome is established, it is believed to be relatively stable throughout a person's life, although short- and long-term changes can occur. Antibiotics dramatically affect the microbiome. The ability of the microbial residents to bounce back after a round of antibiotics varies greatly among individuals, and multiple rounds of antibiotics can significantly shift the types of microbes that survive. Often this kind of disruption leads to dysbiosis, an imbalance of beneficial and pathogenic bacteria and other microbes.   Dietary changes also significantly alter the microbiome, and preliminary human studies suggest that these changes can occur in as little as three days. Interestingly, while what we eat alters our microbiomes, the microbiota also appear to influence what we choose to eat, as microbes compete for space and nutrients. Researchers suspect that dominant gut microbes trigger cravings for foods that either benefit them or suppress their bacterial competitors.   Microbes may even create dysphoria in the host until the person succumbs to the craving. Researchers propose several possible mechanisms by which this works: Microbes may be able to influence taste receptors, making certain foods taste better; they may spark the release of hunger-triggering hormones; or they may influence eating habits by hijacking the vagus nerve that connects the gut and brain.   Altered microbiota and dysbiosis may be related to many chronic diseases and conditions, including obesity, diabetes, metabolic syndrome, depression and gut diseases. This link appears to be rooted in inflammation, endotoxemia and possibly changes to the immune system, which means treating the gut may be an effective way for registered dietitian nutritionists to address multiple conditions.   Digestive Health, IBS and IBD   Irritable Bowel Syndrome is an increasingly common functional gastrointestinal disorder, the hallmark symptoms of which include abdominal discomfort or pain, distension and bloating, and diarrhea, constipation or a combination of both. Low-grade inflammation and significant dysbiosis are prominent features of this syndrome. While normal gut microbiota prevent pathogenic bacteria from gaining a foothold on the intestinal lining, dysbiosis may allow the bacteria associated with IBS symptoms to thrive, triggering further inflammation by activating the immune system.   People with IBS often experience higher levels of anxiety, stress and depression, as well as higher rates of metabolic syndrome. While the exact cause of IBS remains unclear, some research points to dysbiosis along with dysregulation of the brain-gut axis and autonomic nervous system. IBS and inflammatory bowel disease  including ulcerative colitis and Crohn's disease  are associated with increased intestinal permeability (sometimes referred to as ""leaky gut syndrome""). IBS typically features low levels of beneficial Bifidobacterium bacteria; IBD, which also may be triggered by dysbiosis, features low bacterial diversity. Probiotics have shown to be effective therapeutic interventions for both IBS and IBD, shown to improve intestinal integrity, alleviate symptoms, reduce inflammation and strengthen the intestinal barrier.   Obesity, Type 2 Diabetes and Metabolic Syndrome   Obesity and its consequences are a complex set of syndromes. Lifestyle, diet and exercise habits contribute significantly to this ""diabesity"" epidemic, though changes to the microbiota also appear to play a role by influencing weight gain and metabolism. From animal studies, we've learned that transferring gut bacteria from obese animals to germ-free, lean animals induces obesity and metabolic disease, even when diets are unchanged.   While the relationship of microbiota and weight in humans is less clear, studies have consistently demonstrated dysbiosis in people with Type 2 diabetes. Healthy control subjects tend to have more bacteria that produce the shortchain fatty acid butyrate, and individuals with Type 2 diabetes tend to have higher levels of pathogens, such as Clostridium species, though research has not yet confirmed whether a difference in gut microbes is a contributing factor or an effect. In addition, when pathogen-free microbiota from lean, healthy donors are transferred to patients with metabolic disease, insulin sensitivity improves.   Microbiota and Mood   Lending credence to the gut's reputation as a ""second brain,"" it's been observed that stress and depression are linked with IBS and IBD, and the microbiome also may play a role. Psychological and physiological stress affects the gut in ways that alter the microbiota and foster dysbiosis, bacterial overgrowth and intestinal permeability. These changes trigger inflammation and affect the brain and central nervous system through increased toxic exposures (endotoxins from bacterial metabolites enter the bloodstream through a ""leaky gut"") and neurotransmitter disruption. Gut microbes produce hormones and neurotransmitters that are taken up by the human brain.   Preliminary research indicates that changes to the microbiome may affect things such as mood, anxiety, memory and concentration. Rodent studies have found that manipulating the microbiome results in changed behavior. However, while an anti-inflammatory diet could provide some benefit, there aren't any large-scale human studies that clarify the role of dietary intervention on the central nervous system with respect to changes to the microbiome.   Mind Your Microbes   Amid mounting interest in its influence on human health and disease, attention has turned to therapeutic approaches that target the gut. A diet high in fruit, vegetables and perhaps whole grains allows beneficial bacteria to dominate and inhibits the growth of more harmful strains. While researchers haven't reached consensus about what constitutes an optimal microbiome, there is some general advice for tending our microbial gardens:        Fruit and Vegetables   A plant-centric diet rich in vegetables, fruit and legumes, and high in dietary fiber and polyphenols, appears to benefit the microbiota. These foods offer intestinal bacteria fuel in the form of prebiotics.      Fermented Foods   While beneficial bacterial strains found in fermented foods may not settle into the gut permanently, they may affect microbiota by influencing the gene expression of the bacteria already there. Naturally fermented foods, such as yogurt and kefir with ""live, active cultures,"" sauerkraut, kimchi, tempeh and raw vinegar, are high in beneficial Lactobacillus bacteria. To get the benefits, be sure the foods are ""lactofermented"" or naturally fermented and raw or unpasteurized, as pasteurization kills beneficial bacteria.     Garden Herbs   Garlic and leeks contain natural sources of the prebiotic inulin. Garlic also has natural antimicrobial properties, which may help suppress pathogenic bacteria and foster beneficial bacteria growth.      Focus on Fresh   Enjoy minimally processed foods and limit sugar and unhealthy fats, especially trans fats. Some studies have associated diets of highly-processed foods with dysbiosis and pro-inflammatory microbiota.      Probiotic Supplements   Consider taking a high-quality probiotic supplement (with several different strains of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species, such as L. acidophilus, L. reuteri, B. longum and B. bifidum), particularly during and after antibiotic use to recolonize the digestive tract and help manage antibiotic-induced diarrhea. Since antibiotics kill all bacteria, it is best to take probiotic supplements at least two hours before or after taking antibiotics.

"Besting Breastfeeding Bullies: A Case for Supporting, Not Shaming
Has the ""breast is best"" mantra gone too far in perpetuating these feelings among women who cannot, or choose not, to breastfeed",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/September-October-2014/Besting-Breastfeeding-Bullies-Support-Not-Shame/,"""Breast is best"" has long been the mantra to new mothers and is a favorite among many registered dietitian nutritionists.     There's no shortage of good reasons for moms to breastfeed their infants; numerous studies point to the nutritional and health benefits of breast milk, including reduced risk of ear infections, sudden infant death syndrome, obesity and respiratory illness, as well as improved maternal outcomes such as a reduced risk of ovarian and breast cancer, Type 2 diabetes and postpartum depression.     For some mothers, however, breastfeeding isn't an option  either because they can't breastfeed or they choose to formula-feed instead. And many of these moms report feeling shame and guilt about their situation.     Has the ""breast is best"" mantra gone too far in perpetuating these feelings among women who cannot, or choose not, to breastfeed?     Too Much Pressure?   ""Bullies"" may be a strong label to those who passionately believe that breast milk is the best food for babies  and in most cases, it is likely an unfair depiction of many breastfeeding advocates.     La Leche, an organization that fervently promotes breastfeeding via mother-to-mother support, is sometimes cited as one of the ""extremist"" breastfeeding groups. Although its approach may seem dogmatic to some, La Leche was founded in 1956 when formula was the go-to choice for mothers, and has dedicated the past 58 years to promoting the benefits of breastfeeding.     Over the years, campaigns and programs to boost breastfeeding among new mothers have been largely successful.     Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2014 Breastfeeding Report Card shows that more than three-quarters of moms begin breastfeeding their infant. Yet despite these promising stats, a study published in 2013 in Pediatrics found first-time moms who report problems and concerns with breastfeeding during the first few days after giving birth are nearly 10 times as likely to quit breastfeeding within two months.     Those findings aren't surprising to Ginger Carney, MPH, RD, LDN, IBCLC, FILCA, FAND, director of clinical nutrition and lactation consultant at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. ""It takes a village for a woman to successfully breastfeed,"" says Carney, noting there are many barriers that make breastfeeding more difficult than it has to be.     ""Some of these barriers start in the birth hospital when moms and babies are separated, or when formula is provided to mothers who are breastfeeding,"" she says. ""Other barriers that occur later include unwelcome looks when moms try to feed their babies in public or when new moms return to work and need to find a private place to pump.""     Much of Carney's work with new mothers is centered on dispelling myths and providing women with the education and tools to work around these barriers.     Katie Mulligan, MS, RDN, LDN, is an extension service dietitian at the University of Rhode Island whose own experience changed her perspective of formula. Trying to ""do the right thing"" by breastfeeding resulted in the hospitalization of her 5-day-old daughter while Mulligan waited for her milk to come in. With the help of a lactation consultant, Mulligan used formula to supplement her breast milk. ""You think that breastfeeding is natural. No one tells you that breastfeeding can be incredibly hard and heart-wrenching, and that you feel like the world's worst mom when it doesn't work out,"" Mulligan says.     Many other new moms agree; a 2012 study found that 43 percent of first-time mothers feel guilty about using formula instead of breastfeeding. ""My opinion was definitely different before I had a child,"" Mulligan says. ""Now I am much more open to formula as a perfectly good option for babies.""     Less Judgment, More Support   Babies not latching on properly, concerns over quantity of breast milk and pain during breastfeeding are typical situations that certified lactation consultant Freda Rosenfeld, IBCLC, encounters in her work with new moms. ""I'd say that in 80 percent of cases, I'm successful in helping women achieve their nursing goals,"" says Rosenfeld, adding that the operative phrase is their nursing goals.     While in an ideal world all women might exclusively nurse, Rosenfeld is also pragmatic: Medical conditions, use of medications, returning to work, fatigue and other factors influence how much, how long and if ever a woman can breastfeed, or if the addition of formula is needed. Each mother's goals, options and situations are different; important points for RDNs to consider and remember when counseling new mothers.     ""My belief is that every woman should first and foremost be educated about breastfeeding, and those who want to breastfeed should be helped to be successful,"" Rosenfeld says. ""But no one should ever be made to feel guilty about their choice or circumstance.""     Elizabeth Ward, MS, RD, author of  Expect the Best: Your Guide to Healthy Eating Before, During & After Pregnancy  (Wiley 2009) couldn't agree more. ""Women need support for their decisions, not pressure or shame,"" says Ward. ""Being happy is the greatest gift you can give your baby, and if that means no breastfeeding and using formula instead, then that's the best choice.""     But sometimes, that's easier said than done. Like many moms-to-be, Massachusetts-based dietitian Dianne Rishikof, MS, RDN, LDN, always assumed that she would breastfeed, but medical issues thwarted her plans. A conversation with her cousin  a pediatrician who holds a strong ""breast milk only"" stance  left her devastated and feeling like a failure. While reassurance from both her own doctor and pediatrician that using formula would not harm her baby's health helped ease her worries and anxiety, the seesaw feelings of guilt continued for months, perpetuated in part by parenting books she read.     Only after her son turned 6 months old and it was clear that he was nourished, healthy and attached to her did Rishikof come to terms with her circumstances. ""I am at peace with this choice that was taken away from me, but I still feel like I need to say 'for medical reasons' whenever I talk about bottle feeding my kids,"" says Rishikof. ""And that need for defensive justification speaks volumes to the pressure or judgment that I must still feel.""     Mulligan has spoken out against the pressures mothers face feeling like they are failures if they don't breastfeed and has found support among fellow RDNs, for the most part. However, she says, ""There are dietitians who think we should 'warn mothers of the dangers of formula'  that's an exact quote  and that type of thinking does nothing but harm, to the mother and to you, as a health professional.""     Using formula to feed a baby is sometimes a conscious choice and other times a decision that's out of a mother's control. Either way, health professionals' roles are to provide less judgment and more support and encouragement  and, of course, science-based nutrition education free from personal bias.

"Theresa A. Galvin: HIV/AIDs Advocate
Despite what she calls the ""happenstance"" aspect of her work in HIV/AIDS care, Theresa Galvin has developed a deep connection to the issue. Despite advances in HIV/AIDS care, she says, ""We still have an epidemic.",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Theresa-Galvin/,"Photo: Robert Bean       Thirty years ago, Theresa Galvin was just beginning her career as a NYC-based dietitian when an AIDS-designated unit opened in the long term care facility where she worked. Despite what she calls the ""happenstance"" aspect of her work in HIV/AIDS care, it is a role to which she has developed a deep connection. Galvin is now the community HIV nutritionist and supervisor of nutrition services for Village Care Certified Home Health Agency and serves as the Ryan White grant program manager. Despite advances in HIV/AIDS care, Galvin says, ""We still have an epidemic.I know people think thats a radical statement, but I only know what I know.""     Q: How has your work evolved over the course of your career?   It was the 1980s and the beginning of the AIDS epidemic. The expectation at the time was patients admitted (to my facility) were merely sent there to live out the remainder of their short lives. Today the face of HIV/AIDS presents differently: Replacing clear and imminent death of the early days is now living with HIV, but typically with a host of multiple co-morbidities. This poses new challenges to treatment, management and outcomes.     Q: How has your work made a difference in your community?   The difference is measurable: fewer AIDS-related deaths, fewer people becoming homebound, less malnutrition and wasting, more medications and overall improvement in immune functioning. And since HIV and malnutrition essentially impact the same components of the immune system, I like to think that nutrition has been a big part of that success.     Q: Is there a particular anecdote that would illustrate why this work is so important?   If I had to pick one it would be a patient I called the Marlboro Man. I worked with him over the course of a month. At what would be my last clinic visit with him, he broke down and cried. He had just seen the doctor: His T cells were like a handful of M&Ms, and the AZT wasnt working anymore. He was fearful, alone and apparently had endured his journey alone and in silence. Thats what HIV stigma looks like.     A week later he was in the ICU, on a ventilator. I went right up to see him. I know that a month is not a long time to know someone, but in those days it was all about the quality of time spent with a patient. Unable to speak but totally lucid, he tried first to speak, then to write in the air. He then got teary-eyed and signed to me. At the time I was living across the street from a School for the Deaf, and stopped there after work, trying to repeat his gestures. The guy smiled and said, It means I love you. I was overcome by emotion.     The next day Mr. Marlboro was gone. This, like so many patient losses over the years, taught me a lot of life lessons  it shaped my perspective on living, dying and impermanence; the importance of quality versus quantity; and a great deal of compassion, humility and gratitude for the simplest acts of kindness. It is something I like to think I carried on with me in patient care.     Q: What do you find most rewarding about your efforts?   The circuitry of birth to death is so very profound  it is the one thing that all humanity shares. Every HIV-infected person encountered in my almost 30 years of HIV/AIDS care touched me in their special, indelible ways. It has truly been a privilege to companion them on their most intimate of travels that, for many, brought them to their journeys end.     Q: Looking ahead, how would you like to see your project develop or grow?   [Editor's note: Galvin was interviewed at the time of the government shutdown.]   For me, thinking ahead to any day beyond the current day seems overwhelming and incomprehensible. And if it feels that way to me, then it is surely magnified 20 more times for the patients we care for. I may not have a lot of control over what is happening at the government level, but I do have control over what is happening at my own level. We must reinvent ourselves given the current climate  for me that means donning my old hat of AIDS advocacy with a new and reignited fire and asking my colleagues to join me."
"Harvest on the Front Lines

That's because, as fun as it is, it leaves you plenty of time to look over a field and think",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/November-2012/Harvest-on-the-Front-Lines/,"This featured post is by  Jennie Schmidt, MS, RD . You can follow this blogger  @FarmGirlJen .     There's really no better place to reflect on the year than driving a combine. That's because, as fun as it is, it leaves you plenty of time to look over a field and think.     Harvest is both busy and reflective. It can be rewarding or disappointing, depending on how well Mother Nature treated us this year and if we have had any major and expensive equipment breakdowns or other interferences in our ability to get the crops in. So far, with the exception of a second year of drought in our region though less harsh than last years  this year harvest has gone reasonably well and crops are doing better than anticipated.     Allow me to share part of my story. I started life as a Registered Dietitian 20 years ago. I worked in both clinical long-term care, and public health arenas before leaving the profession to work full-time on our family farm. Frankly, I feel like I never left the profession because farming is the front-line of nutrition. I say I literally practice nutrition in the field.     Our family farm is a third-generation, 2,000-acre, highly diversified operation producing grain, hay, fruit and vegetables on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. Harvest on our farm begins in May and continues through November, and sometimes into December. Because of the number of crops we grow and the seasonality of those crops, we keep busy harvesting something like seven months out of the year.     In May we begin harvesting hay which continues through September depending on the years rainfall, which dictates how many times we can harvest a hay field. In June and July, we harvest barley, then wheat. In August, it's cannery tomatoes and fresh market green beans. In September, wine grapes and corn. Then, in September through early December, we continue to harvest corn and soybeans, including tofu or food-grade soybeans that we grow for regional Asian food processors in the D.C., Baltimore and Philadelphia area.     The family farm keeps us busy but is extremely rewarding. I wouldnt want to raise my kids anywhere else but on a family farm. They understand birth and death, the benefits of hard work, and the togetherness of family at work and play.     Harvest to me is the summation of all of my familys blood, sweat, and tears encapsulated into a season. Harvest is our collected prayers for Mother Nature to cooperate and send us rain when we need it, make hurricanes stay out in the Atlantic, and give us sunny days to dry hay and ripen grapes. Harvest is walking through the fields to check the crops and evaluate which varieties did well, and which we shouldnt grow in the future.     Harvest is the desire to keep everyone on the farm safe, and hope that we will actually be able to spend some quality time together during the slow months of winter. Harvest is watching the fruits of our labor grow and produce food for the many. Harvest is reflecting on our land and soil stewardship each and every year, wanting to be sustainable both environmentally and economically, and leaving the farm in better condition than we received it.     Harvest is family, working side by side every day and still loving each other. Harvest is the full circle of life, every year, every day, the fruits of our sowing and reaping.

Liver: It’s What’s for Dinner
Internal animal organs, known as offal, can be found in many dishes closely identified with a worldly region.",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/July-2014/Liver-Its-Whats-for-Dinner/,"This featured post is by  Bethany Grzesiak, MS, RD . You can follow this blogger  @BthnyJane15 .   In American culture, the mention of organ meat does not typicallyevoke a mouth-watering response. Yet internationally, carnivores across the globe don't hesitate to devour this edible animal tissue, often considering it to be a delicacy. Internal animal organs, known as offal, can be found in many dishes closely identified with a worldly region.   When in Scotland, for example, you can fuel up on haggis, a savory pudding made from, among other ingredients, sheeps heart, liver and lungs. In France, a small snack could include  foie gras , or fatty duck liver. Rather than wasting sources of calories and nutrients, chefs throughout history became creative and learned to prepare every ounce of the hunted animal.   However, recent controversy over the safety of offal consumption has become a hot topic.   On one side, many medical experts (and grandmothers alike) tout the benefits of consuming offal. Take one of the more well-known edible organ meats: liver. One 4-oz. serving of beef liver contains 155 calories, 4g total fat, and a whopping 23g protein. It's also a good source of copper, folic acid, iron and B vitamins, as well as one of the most concentrated sources of vitamin A. The National Institute of Health even lists liver as a meat option that, when eaten moderately, may be beneficial to treat anemia.   Comparatively, a 4-oz. ground beef patty (80% lean/20% fat) provides 280 kcal, 22g fat and 19g protein. The ground beef contains many of the same micronutrients but, when placed side by side, the liver appears to be the more nutritious choice.   The other side of the debate brings other facts to light. Most notably, the seemingly healthful high concentration of vitamin A found in animal liver can be a fatal side effect if over-consumed. The active form of vitamin A, known as retinol, can build up to a toxic level within the body. To put it in perspective, one ounce of beef liver contains 8,881 IU vitamin A. The recommended upper limit for males and females older than 19 years is 3,000 IU. Other side effects of vitamin A toxicity (Hypervitaminosis A) include nausea, skin and hair changes, bone pain or swelling and birth defects.   Current cattle-raising methods offer a new source of controversy. Two main functions of an animal liver include detoxifying chemicals and metabolizing drugs. There is building concern over the method of injecting American cattle with growth hormone to produce a larger product yield. Since the liver acts as a filter, the concern is that consuming this organ will expose our bodies to larger quantities of hormone than we would get by only eating animal muscle.   All in all, the debate over the safety and health benefits of liver seems to lead to the same conclusion as many other of our decadent favorites: eat in moderation. The nutritional value of your total diet will determine if eating liver is actually beneficial, so be mindful of all the foods you choose to eat. If the flavor is one you enjoy, be careful not to go overboard, since there are known, and deadly, side effects. Young children and pregnant women should take extra caution, since they are at higher risk of vitamin A toxicity.   If you are feeling adventurous here is a simple recipe to try. Enjoy!

Does Celiac Disease Cause Infertility?
It’s commonly known that around 1 percent of the population has celiac disease — a severe autoimmune reaction to gluten — and we often think of it as a gastrointestinal disorder. But celiac is four to eight times more common in women who are experiencing infertility without any other known cause",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/April-2013/Does-Celiac-Disease-Cause-Infertility/,"This featured post is by  Cheryl Harris, MPH, RD . You can follow this blogger  @CherylHarrisRD .       Infertility is one of the hardest things for couples who want children, and celiac disease is frequently an overlooked cause.     Its commonly known that around 1 percent of the population has  celiac disease   a severe autoimmune reaction to  gluten   and we often think of it as a gastrointestinal disorder. But celiac is four to eight times more common in women who are experiencing infertility without any other known cause.This is a particularly tricky issue, because many of these women are not experiencing any of the typical celiac tummy troubles, and most dont even have anemia, which is often the most visible sign of celiac.     Many doctors now suggest screening for celiac when there isnt another obvious cause for infertility. Its also a much simpler and less invasive test than many of the infertility procedures. If youre reading this, most likely celiac already is on your radar screen, but you know as well as I do that this isnt universal. Since theres such a genetic link involved, if you have family members who are experiencing infertility or miscarriages, or if you know people experiencing infertility, do consider passing this information along! (Gently, of course, to people who you think might be open to it.)     Whats Causing the Infertility?     With untreated celiac disease, every time the mom-to-be eats gluten, her body attacks the small intestine, which often causes nutritional deficiencies. Obviously this makes it harder to get pregnant and to have a healthy pregnancy. The nutrients people with celiac arent absorbing well are the same ones that grow babies: such as iron, vitamin D, B vitamins, zinc, magnesium, calcium, etc.     But theres more than that. An untreated autoimmune disease  even without  nutrient deficiencies isnt good for mom or baby. The same tissue transglutaminase antibodies that doctors look at to identify active celiac disease and how patients are responding to a  gluten-free  diet can actually interfere with pregnancy. According to Daniel Leffler, MD, MS, director of clinical research at the Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, It turns out that antibodies affect the placenta in negative ways. We thought they were just good diagnostic markers, but they also seem to bind to and wreak havoc on many areas of the body.     This also means that moms-to-be will have the best chance of a healthy pregnancy if they wait six months or until the tTg (tissue transglutaminase) levels are back to normal and nutritional deficiencies are corrected. Because, at the end of the day, the goal is not just getting pregnant, but having a happy, healthy baby.     Dont Forget Dad     We tend to focus on the mom, but if the dad has untreated celiac,  he  may be the cause of infertility. Vitamins A and E and zinc are critical to sperm production. And one study even showed that fathers with untreated celiac were five times more likely to have low-birth weight babies.     Smart Steps and Tips     So, if you want to get pregnant and have celiac disease, make sure youve checked with your doctor about nutritional deficiencies and your thyroid, too. People with celiac are more likely to have autoimmune thyroid diseases, too, such as Hashimotos or Graves, which often show up during and after pregnancy.     Its also critical to make sure youre eating a balanced diet. Most  gluten-free  products arent fortified the way regular products are, and  many are both higher calorie and higher in empty, starchy carbs , too. The nutrients that are low in the diets of women with on a gluten-free diet (iron, B vitamins, calcium, fiber) are needed by both mom and baby.     Snacks can be the hardest, because its typical to reach for whatever is lying around. But for most people who eat gluten-free, a little planning goes a long way. Chopped fruits and veggies like carrots, celery, peppers, etc. are wonderful foods to pack and go. Nuts and seeds are always perfect options because they are shelf-stable. When refrigeration isnt an issue, a yogurt or a cheese stick works well.     Want to learn more? Check out these sources:        Shah S, Leffler D.

Breaking Bread around the World
Mankind's first processed food brings people together",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/November-December-2014/Breaking-Bread-around-the-World/,"Whether its  naan  in India,  baguettes  in France,  tortillas  in Mexico or  lavash  in the Middle East, the breaking of bread brings people together throughout the world.   Bread is a significant symbol in many religions, with numerous nods to it in the Old and New testaments. It even inspires poetry. Omar Khayym, 11th century Persian mathematician and astronomer, included the well-known verse, A jug of wine, a loaf of bread, and thou, in one of his poems.   There also are a number of secular connotations for the word. For example, bread (as well as dough) is slang for money. A bread line refers to people waiting for food from a charitable organization or public agency  akin to todays soup kitchen or food bank. A persons bread and butter refers to ones main source of income. The breaking of bread means to eat a meal with others. And bread is called the staff of life because its considered a mainstay of the diet throughout history, all over the world.   Bread is one of mankinds first processed foods. In pre-historic times, a mix of ground grains and water could be cooked on hot stones, making a type of flatbread. Ancient Egyptians are believed to have cultivated wheat and developed a grinding stone called a quern, which crushed grains into coarse flour. The first leavened bread likely happened by accident, when yeast from the air mixed with the combination of flour and water; however, yeast production became a profession in itself in ancient Egypt. Archeological digs have excavated bread ovens and tools, and bread loaves of varying shapes and sizes have been unearthed in tombs and burial sites.   White breads were especially popular among the ancient Romans and Greeks, for whom a lighter color bread indicated higher quality. Over time, milk, eggs and butter were sometimes added to the dough, along with fruit, sweeteners and other ingredients. The art of baking was held in high regard; a representative of the Guild of Bakers held a seat in the Roman Senate.   By the Middle Ages, bread had spread into Asia and the rest of Europe, with different cultures using whichever grains were common in their regions. For example, the Vikings mainly made bread from rye, while Chinas steamed breads were often made from rice, sorghum and other indigenous grain flours. Kings and landlords employed staff solely dedicated to baking bread, while poorer people typically brought their dough to a communal oven.   The Industrial Age ushered in the beginning of todays commercial breads. Mass production of yeast began and Charles Fleischman started selling yeast to bakers, and then to the public, within a few short years. Flour mills appeared in Europe and America, and bread moved from being a homemade product to a commercially produced staple. In 1930, Wonder Bread  that soft, white bread in the famous white package with red, blue and yellow circles  became the first commercially-produced sliced bread. In the 1940s, thiamin, niacin, riboflavin and iron were added to enriched flour and hence, into breads, in a public health campaign to ward off nutrient deficiency diseases such as beriberi and pellagra. In 1998, folic acid was added to the list of required nutrients to enrich commercial breads to help prevent birth defects.   Today, many bread manufacturers are expanding product lines made with gluten-free flours or starches, xanthan gum and emulsifiers to mimic breads containing gluten, while others are exploring reduced-sodium formulas. Consumers are also looking for breads that offer bonus nutrition, such as added fiber, calcium and vitamin D. On the flip side, bread is the No. 1 source of sodium in the American diet. While its per-serving sodium (80 mg to 230 mg per slice) pales in comparison to that of other foods, people tend to eat multiple servings of bread throughout the day.   But while Americans sure o love their bread, research indicates were on the pathway to making healthier choices when it comes to navigating the bread aisle. A recent survey indicated that 56 percent of consumers are cutting back on white bread, while more consumers are seeking whole-grain and multi-grain breads. Could bread manufacturing and consumption be coming full circle to its humbler, simpler beginnings?   Do Know Your Loaves?   Despite their different textures, shapes and flavors, breads can generally be classified into three categories: yeast breads, flat breads and quick breads. Here are samples from around the world of each type:   Yeast Breads   Yeast breads use yeast as the leavening agent to help dough rise. Some examples include: brioche  (rich French bread); baguette  (long, thin loaf French bread with crispy crust); bauernbrot  (German sourdough bread); challah  (braided Jewish Sabbath bread); cherniy hleb  (Russian black bread);  kulich  (Eastern Orthodox sweet Easter bread); and  pan de jamn  (Venezuelan stuffed bread of ham, raisin and olive bread).   Flat Breads  Flat breads are thin and flat breads, as the name implies. Some may be leavened (such as Italian foccacia, Greek pita or Native American frybread, that are cooked in oil), while others do not include a leavening agent of any sort. Examples of other flat breads include:  naan  (Indian tandoor-baked bread);  lavash  (Middle Eastern thin flatbread);  tortillas  (corn or wheat Mexican round flatbread);  bammy (Jamaican cassava flatbread);  lefse  (Norwegian potato flatbread); and  matzah  (Jewish cracker-type bread).   Quick Breads  These breads do not require kneading or rising time, since a leavening agent (baking powder or baking soda, for example), helps the dough rise quickly when its combined with a liquid. Eggs may also help leaven quick breads. Examples of quick breads include popovers (American version of the English Yorkshire pudding that is a hollow, light and airy roll); buttermilk biscuits (Southern American favorite that uses buttermilk); soda bread (Irish soda-leavened bread); cornbread (American quick bread that contains corn meal. Other variations include Johnnycakes, corn pone and hushpuppies); and Boston brown bread (early American steamed bread traditionally baked in a can and sweetened with molasses).

6 Simple Strategies for Shoring up Your Mobile Security
Unless you're completely off the grid, no one is categorically immune to online crime. But there are best practices for shoring up your cybersecurity",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/September-October-2016/6-Simple-Strategies-for-Shoring-up-Your-Mobile-Security/,"Photo: Janis Veveris/Hemera/Thinkstock     Once upon a time,  attending a meeting or conference, or being out of the office for any reason, could be a bit of an ordeal. Even with back-up staff, daily operational activities were often put on hold (or accumulated) for one's return. Today's age of mobility and digital convenience makes conducting business as usual from the road easier than ever. But while there are obvious advantages to keeping up at work remotely while leveraging face-to-face opportunities to learn and network, with every byte of data transferred or piece of personal information stored on devices or online, there is an increased risk to security.   As smartphones and tablets become increasingly ubiquitous, sophisticated and integrated into users' lives, mobile devices have emerged as appealing targets for online criminals. Last year alone, the discovery of new mobile vulnerabilities jumped 214 percent; social media security attacks were on the rise (with Facebook scams as the No. 1 web attack method in the second half of 2015); and nearly half a billion personal records were reported as stolen or lost.   Research company Gartner predicts there will be 6.8 billion connected devices in use in 2016, a 30-percent increase over 2015. By 2020, that number will jump to more than 20 billion connected devices, predicts Gartner. Further  with 4 out of 5 victims not realizing they've been attacked for weeks or longer  many cybersecurity experts estimate unreported theft is significantly higher.   Unless you're completely off the grid, no one is categorically immune to online crime. But there are  best practices for shoring up your cybersecurity.     Install Updates   Updates may seem like a never-ending stream of patches and downloads, but there's a reason for that  namely that developers are trying to stay ahead of hackers by constantly refining systems. Help them help you by making sure your operating systems and apps are up to date on mobile devices and laptops. Do this from your secure home or office network (never through public Wi-Fi) and have a charger handy so you don't run out of battery power.   On your mobile devices, go to the application center (App Store on iOS devices, Google Play on Android devices) and install all updates. On your laptop, make sure you are running the latest version of your web browser. Visit  whatbrowser.org ,  a free and couldn't-be-easier website from Google that displays which web browser you are using and whether it is the most current version. If you use anti-malware or other security software, make sure it's up to date, too.   Disable Geotagging and Unnecessary Location Services   Every app developer, webmaster and marketing manager in the world wants to know as much as possible about their users  right down to their exact geographic coordinates. Some sites and apps share your location in online communities, usually in the spirit of engagement, but to the chagrin of security experts. On an iOS device, access Location Services under privacy settings and select ""never"" next to any apps (including camera) for which pinpointing your location is not absolutely necessary. On an Android device, disable ""geo-tag photos"" in Settings. And in any social media channel's privacy settings, disabling location services is recommended.   Scrub Your Social Media Profiles   This is arguably the safety tactic that today's online audience just doesn't want to accept, largely because so many people believe that not sharing personal details translates to ""not being social."" But here's the reality: Criminals exploit the trust people have in their own circle, and posting certain data on your social media profiles puts you and your family or friends at risk.   According to net security expert Andy O'Donnell, CISSP-ISSEP, who has developed, audited and secured systems for the U.S. Department of Defense and major educational institutions, information that should never be posted to social networks includes your full birthdate, your current location (see the section, ""Disable Geotagging"" above), pictures of children with their names, your home address, your real phone number and your relationship status. Any one of these can provide scammers and identity thieves with information they can use to access financial accounts or apply for official documents, such as birth certificates and passports.   Be Wary of Public Wi-Fi Networks   There are plenty of cafes, hotels, libraries and other institutions that offer complimentary Wi-Fi as a service to patrons. But anyone can create a Wi-Fi hotspot, name it ""Dave's Coffee Shop"" or ""Fancy Hotel Name"" (or simply ""free WIFI"") and then track your every move. Before you log on, verify with the establishment that the network is truly theirs. Look for network ID signage, and if you don't see it, ask someone who works there.   A retail shop, conference center or hotel offering password-protected Wi-Fi should identify the exact network and sign-in credentials. (For example, the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics will provide this information to FNCE attendees in Boston.) And for the safest experience, avoid banking or shopping online until you're back on your own secure network at home.   Avoid Unsecure Sites   Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, or HTTP, is probably a familiar acronym to anyone who has been online in the last 25 years (think  http://www ...), but HTTP websites offer zero protection against data interception. If you submit information via an HTTP website, anyone with even rudimentary hacking skills could intercept it. Today, most legitimate companies and organizations requesting information have Secure Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, or HTTPS, websites that use security technology to transfer data. How can you tell? Go to the homepage of  eatrightPRO.org . Look at the website address in your browser's address bar, and you'll see the address is "" http://www.eatrightPRO.org .""     That's fine since this page is merely showing users content, and not asking for any information.   Now click on ""Sign In"" in the upper right corner. See how the address changes to "" https://www.eatrightPRO.org ""?     That means this site uses security technology to help protect the information users submit. Nonetheless, no website is completely foolproof, so always be judicious about the data you submit online (social security numbers, passport ID numbers and bank account PINs are particularly attractive to online criminals) and make a habit of reviewing your monthly bank and credit card activity reports.   Turn Off Network Discovery Options   Although it was developed with the intention of connecting conveniently and saving data plan usage, Wi-Fi auto-connect functionality can potentially pop your phone (and all personal data contained within) into a network, or run malware in the background while you're not even using your smartphone. Depending on the number of networks you've joined or saved, there are a few ways around this (namely by selecting   Forget This Network on an iOS device or Forget on an Android device when you're done using the Wi-Fi network). Another easy solution is to completely disable Wi-Fi when you're not actively using email, social media or the internet  which not only helps stop hackers and cybercriminals from connecting while your device is idle, but may preserve your attention span while you live, learn and engage in the moment.

"Fares of Faith: Krishna Janmashtami
Hindus believe Lord Krishna is the personification of love, joy and knowledge. Krishna Janmashtami, or simply Janmashtami, is the two-day birthday celebration of his birth.",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/July-August-2015/Fares-of-Faith-Krishna-Janmashtami/,"Krishna Janmashtami, or simply Janmashtami,  is the two-day birthday celebration of the Hindu deity Lord Krishna. The holiday is celebrated throughout India and in Hindu homes around the world, but the spirit of devotion is especially prevalent in the ancient cities Mathura and Vrindavan, where Krishna spent his childhood.   Hindus believe Lord Krishna is the personification of love, joy and knowledge. He is considered the most personable Hindu deity, always ready to answer the prayers of his followers. A brave hero, wise teacher and loving friend to all, Krishna has had an overwhelming influence on Indian philosophy and culture.   The legend of Janmashtami begins about 5,000 years ago, when Mother Earth and her children were grieving terribly under the dark rule of the demon kings. The outlook was so bleak that Lord Vishnu, the Godhead of the Hindu trinity, chose to be reborn as baby Krishna to bring love and peace to the world and end the rule of evil kings.   Celebration and Fasting Janmashtami festivities last two full days, which generally fall in August or September. Devotees spend the first day of festivities fasting, singing and preparing Krishnas favorite foods  mostly sweet, milk-based dishes  to offer their Lord at midnight. Beautifully decorated temples and homes exude an aroma of rich desserts and flavorful spices.   Many devotees fast on the first day of Janmashtami. In Hinduism, fasting is considered a sacrificial gift that allows individuals to grow closer to God and repent for sins. In a  phalahar  fast, worshippers are allowed to consume fruit, water and milk but must refrain from cereal and salt. The most devoted followers keep a  nirjal  fast, which excludes food and water. During the fast, devotees spend the day preparing Krishnas favorite dishes, singing songs and chanting mantras. At midnight, the carefully prepared food offering, or  prasad , is given to Krishna. Fasting is broken by eating the prasad.   Temples at Midnight   Festivities peak at midnight, the time of Krishnas birth. Devotees flock to temples adorned with sparkling lights, hanging flowers and colorful decorations. Holy mantras are chanted, and a conch is blown to symbolize the destruction of evil. A representation Krishna, such as a small statue or figurine, is bathed in a mixture of honey, ghee, sugar and curds, then placed in a cradle. It is believed that those who visit the temple to rock the cradle will have a wish granted. The sweet aroma of Krishnas favorite dishes fills the air as they are placed in front of the cradle. Some Krishna temples prepare as many as 108 dishes, a sacred number in Hinduism.   Breaking the Butter Pot   Dairy products, such as milk, butter and curds, are important staples of Indian cuisine. This is reflected in one of the holidays most beloved traditions,  Dahi Handi . This ritual, carried out on the second day of festivities, is a celebration of Krishnas playful and mischievous side. In a daring public display of acrobatic strength and balance,  Dahi Handi  participants, or  govindas , build a human pyramid to reach a dangling butter pot suspended out of reach. The last  govinda  climbs to the top and strikes the pot until it cracks, spilling curds onto those below.   According to legend, the children of Vrindavan village were deprived of milk products because every drop had to be given to Mathura, the home of evil King Kansa. In response, Krishna and his friends made a human pyramid to reach the pots hanging from ceilings and distribute the prized butter to local children.   Foods of Janmashtami   Food prepared as an offering for Krishna is made with only the finest ingredients in highly sanitary conditions. Because Krishna was known for his sweet tooth and love of milk products, most dishes prepared for Janmashtami are desserts with a milk or yogurt base. Meals are typically vegetarian, as Hindus strongly promote nonviolence and believe all animals have souls. As providers of precious milk, cows are considered sacred in Hinduism, so there are no holiday beef dishes.

"Advice for RDs with Transgender Patients
Do you have transgendered clients seeking nutrition help? Get advice on guidelines, politically correct language and compassion from the UCSF Transgender Health experts to build your practitioner-patient relationship",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Fall-2012/Advice-for-RDs-with-Transgender-Patients/,"Due to differences in lean body composition between biological males and females, it's generally preferable to base nutrition recommendations on the patient's biological sex in order to meet energy and protein needs, in addition to other vitamins and nutrients.   Also be sure to ask if the patient is receiving crosssex hormones (such as androgens for female-sex patients and estrogen for male-sex patients), which may increase risks of certain conditions. For example, transwomen taking oral estrogens may be at increased risk of thromboembolic disease, while taking progesterone can cause weight gain.   Remember to address transgender patients by the gender pronouns (she/he, his/her) with which they identify, even while discussing physical conditions that align with birth-assigned sex.   Counseling with Compassion   In transgender care, use ""sex"" to refer to the birth-assigned or biological sex of an individual and ""gender"" for the person's expression or identity. According to ""Injustice at Every Turn: A Report of the National Transgender Discrimination Survey,"" nearly one-fifth of the survey's 6,450 participants reported refusal of medical care due to transgender or gender non-conforming status, while 30 percent postponed care due to discrimination even when they were sick or injured.   To lay the groundwork for a trusting practitioner-patient relationship with transgender people:    Consider adding a gender question to your patient-intake form. Giving patients the opportunity to declare gender, sex assigned at birth and preferred pronouns not only demonstrates inclusiveness, but prevents a potentially embarrassing first encounter with the practitioner.   If your patient has a spouse or partner, encourage him or her to invite the partner to the next meeting. Ask who does the cooking and how often they eat outthese questions help you see how food and activity behaviors may affect your patient's wellness.   Brush up on transgender vocabulary to communicate accurately and respectfully with your transgender patients. Unintentional slang or misused terms can be inappropriate at best, and offensive or discriminatory at worst.

"Challenging the Stigma of Food Assistance
If we are serious about ending child hunger in the United States and improving our next generation’s health, we must dismantle the stigma associated with food assistance programs.",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/January-2017/Challenging-the-Stigma-of-Food-Assistance/,"Photo: Thinkstock.com/XiXinXing     Poverty is fluid in the United States.  At a moments notice, anyone can find themselves in a life-changing situation such as job loss, reduced wages, a disability diagnosis, divorce or natural disaster.It can take just one crisisto push a family over the edge:an injury that makes it impossible to work, a death in the family, a car breaking down or even the birth of a baby. All of these can be traumatic economic events for a family with little or no savings, putting many Americans at risk for food insecurity.   What is Food Insecurity?    Imagine how you felt the last time you were hungry. Did you experience headaches or did you become aggravated, impatient, frustrated and intolerable? Now envision yourself walking to your refrigerator to find it empty. You open your wallet to learn you do not have money to buy food for the rest of the month. This is food insecurity. Food insecurity also can occur when a person does not have enough money to buy a variety of foods with high nutritional quality. For example, a family experiencing food insecurity may rely on instant noodles or prepared pancake mix to feed their families breakfast, lunch and dinner.   Unfortunately, many people who qualify for food assistance programs such as Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, formerly known as food stamps, do not pursue the support they need because of the stigma associated with food assistance.While food insecurity impacts everyones health negatively, it is particularly crushing to children. Nourishing foods are critical to a childs mental, emotional and physical development.   If we are serious about endingchild hunger in the United States and improving our next generations health, we must dismantle the stigma associated with food assistance programs. We must shift the way we individually and collectively think and talk about food insecurityin the United States.     For more information on food insecurity and how Clancy Cash Harrisons own misconceptions led her to become a food justice advocate, listen to her TEDx Talk on YouTube, below:   &amp;amp;amp;amp;nbsp;     If you have participated in a nutrition program such as the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, or WIC, or anynational school nutritionprogram, dont be afraid to talk about how it transformed your life. What if you did not have access to the National School Lunch Program? Would you have done well on your exams, or would you have been too hungry to concentrate? Did food assistance help pave the way to your higher education? Would you be who you are today if you did not have access to school lunch and breakfast?   Your ability to listen to other peoples stories and share your own success stories will help our nation see food assistance as a hand up, not a hand out.

Picky vs. Problem Eater: A Closer Look at Sensory Processing Disorder
Formerly called sensory integration dysfunction, SPD occurs when the brain has trouble processing information through the senses. SPD exists on a spectrum, affecting one or more of the senses and usually with a combination of over- and under-sensitivities. It affects up to 16 percent of school-age children in the United States",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/September-October-2014/Picky-Eater-Sensory-Processing-Disorder/,"When her second child was born, Jenna knew something was amiss; even as a baby, Alexa was hard to soothe. Today, she is a 3-year-old picky eater who is easily frustrated and melts down over anything from wearing shoes to taking a bath. Alexa was recently diagnosed with sensory processing disorder.     Formerly called sensory integration dysfunction, SPD occurs when the brain has trouble processing information through the senses. SPD exists on a spectrum, affecting one or more of the senses and usually with a combination of over- and under-sensitivities. It affects up to 16 percent of school-age children in the United States. ""SPD is common in children who have autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, but it also affects a surprising number of other young children,"" says Brian     Udell, MD, who practices behavioral pediatrics in Davie, Fla., and blogs at TheAutismDoctor.com.     Although no two children with SPD are the same  some are sensitive to things like a tag on a shirt or the sound of a vacuum cleaner, while others may be uncoordinated, hard to engage in play or in constant motion  most are picky eaters and orally defensive when dealing with taste, smell, sound and textures of foods.     How do you distinguish between a finicky child and a problem eater? ""Eating fewer than 10 foods and really struggling to try new foods is beyond being picky and a red flag for a problem eater,"" says Denver-based pediatric dietitian Jessica Crandall, RDN. Children with SPD may be obese, underweight or even normal weight, yet most suffer from nutritional deficiencies because of their limited food choices.     ""I start with the three-day diet record to determine patterns and uncover nutritional inadequacies,"" says Crandall. ""Food first"" is ideal, but supplements are essential to help fill nutritional gaps in many of the limited-variety diets, which typically have low levels of vitamin D, calcium, zinc and iron.     ""Eating is the most complicated human behavior there is and involves all areas of human development,"" says Kay Toomey, PhD, psychologist and clinical director of SOS Feeding Solutions in Denver. ""Research shows from birth to 8 years, 20 percent of all kids struggle with feeding challenges.""     Many symptoms appear to be ordinary issues  after all, parents struggle daily trying to get picky eaters to eat meals and a wider variety of nutritious foods  but the frequency, intensity and disruption of everyday life may lead parents to seek medical evaluation.     Choose a registered dietitian nutritionist with training and experience for your child's specific needs, suggests sensory science specialist Annette Hottenstein, MS, RD.     Treatment plans are individualized and focus on multisensory activities designed to help children cope where they struggle and get used to food and textures. Exercising patience and persistence without being forceful is key. Structured routines, eating at the same times and locations and with the same utensils can help create comfort and a primer for mealtime. Parents and siblings should serve as role models and praise children for taking a ""no-thank-you"" bite. Foods served should be easy for kids to manage  cut into small, chewable bites or thin strips to hold. Present a child with a total of three foods on their plate, roughly 1 tablespoon per each year of age for each food. Encourage the child to play with their food and explore it. And getting children into the kitchen so they may participate in meal preparation, setting the table, passing food family-style and cleaning up also can be beneficial.     ""Start where they are and advance slowly, because change is hard for these kids,"" says Sally Hara, MS, RD, owner of ProActive Nutrition, specializing in autism spectrum disorders, adding that it can take up to 20 presentations and a lot of positive reinforcement to get kids to try new foods.     The exact cause of SPD is unknown. One recent study looked at the brain activity of SPD children and found abnormal brain structure showing a biological basis differentiating it from other neurodevelopmental disorders. Another study of twins found that hypersensitivity to light and sound may have a genetic component.     However real it may be for affected parents, SPD is not recognized by the American Academy of Pediatrics. A 2012 policy statement by AAP discourages pediatricians from using SPD as a diagnosis because of insufficient evidence as an independent disorder. And last year, SPD was not included in the  Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th Ed.  (AAP 2013).     When a condition is not recognized, research funding and insurance coverage are harder to come by. Children in school are eligible for early intervention assessment, which may offer school-based services; however, Toomey suggests getting a complete evaluation from a medical team consisting of an occupational therapist, speech therapist, registered dietitian nutritionist, developmental pediatrician and a psychologist.

Freekeh with Black Beans and Avocado Dressing
This Freekeh with Black Beans and Avocado Dressing is a whole-grain meal loaded with vegetables and pumpkins seeds then topped with a bright dressing made with fresh avocado, lime and cilantro",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Blog/The-Cutting-Board/June-2015/Freekeh-with-Black-Beans-and-Avocado-Dressing/,"This featured post is by Sara Haas, RDN, LDN. You can follow this blogger  @cookinRD .   A whole-grain meal loaded with vegetables and pumpkins seeds then topped with a bright dressing made with fresh avocado, lime and cilantro.   In the quest to be the best dietitian I can be, I have been working diligently to incorporate more, new whole grains into my (and my family, friends and clients) recipes. I have to admit, for a while I was stuck on quinoa. Its simple and versatileit was a love affair for sure. That love affair continues, but I am opening my mind to new, wonderful grains like freekeh. Its just as easy to cook and just as easy to love. In fact, its a lovely platform for this freekeh with black beans and avocado dressing recipe.   Freekeh is actually a processand not a food. According to the people at FreekehFoods , the birth of freekeh was the result of misfortune. The story goes like this: An ancient Middle Eastern village was attacked and their young wheat fields were set ablaze. In attempts to salvage their crops, the villagers rubbed away the burnt chaff and found that the roasted kernels inside were delicious! How resourceful those ancient villagers were! Freekeh has a fun history, but its also a superstar, nutritionally speaking. It has plenty of fiber and protein as well as zinc and iron. It has a hearty texture, almost like really coarse, thick bulgur and it tastes earthy. This makes it an ideal substitute for rice and other whole grain dishes.     Because I am a huge fan of black beans and avocados, I figured I would try a recipe with freekeh that incorporated those two ingredients. Lets just say it was a winner. The freekeh is a beautiful complement to the bright avocado dressing and the fresh vegetables. The cilantro and pumpkin seeds add crunch and freshness. The black beans boost the protein and fiber content even more, making it a great meal for vegans and vegetarians.   Food Safety Tip: If desired, transferleftoversto Mason jars and layer the ingredients for a fun and easy way to transport them to work. Portion dressing in a separate container. Once you get to work,store your lunchin the refrigerator to prevent potential food poisoning. Also, place your lunch on a shelf inside the refrigerator, and not on the shelves on the inside of the refrigerator door. Your food will stay the coldest and safest.                    Freekeh with Black Beans and Avocado Dressing   Recipe by Sara Haas, RDN, LDN   Ingredients   For the freekeh:     1 cupfreekeh    teaspoon salt   2 1/2 cups water    cup cilantro washed and chopped   1 can (15 ounce can) black beans, rinsed and drained   3 green onions, white and light green parts only, washed, thinly sliced   1 red or yellow bell pepper, washed, seeded and stemmed, thinly sliced   1 cup cherry tomatoes, washed, halved if large    cup toasted pumpking seeds     For the dressing:     1/2 lime, juiced   1/4 cup + 2 tablespoons water   1/4 cup olive oil   1 cup fresh cilantro (leaves and stems), washed   2 cloves of garlic, peeled and smashed   1/2 avocado (flesh only)   1 tablespoon honey   1/8 teaspoon Kosher salt and black pepper)     Directions     Place the freekeh, water and salt in a saucepan. Stir then set over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat so that mixture is simmering, then cover and cook for 20 to 25 minutes.   Once freekeh is cooked, drain any excess water from pan and then let it cool. Toss with freshly chopped cilantro.   In a blender or food processor combine the lime juice, water, olive oil, cilantro, garlic, avocado, honey, salt and pepper. Pulse to combine, then puree until smooth.   To serve: Place the freekeh in a large serving bowl. Top with black beans, green onions, bell pepper, tomatoes and pumpkin seeds. Drizzle with salad dressing or serve dressing on the side. Alternatively, set up the freekeh toppings as ""do-it-yourself"" bar and have family or guests build the dish how they like.

What to Know about What's Not on Supplement Labels
You may have seen the recent headlines — ""Banned Stimulants Found in Supplements"" or ""Hidden Dangers in Dietary Supplements"" — and wondered, are supplements safe",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/July-August-2016/What-to-Know-about-Whats-Not-on-Supplement-Labels/,"Photo: showcake/iStock/Thinkstock     You may have seen the recent headlines   ""Banned Stimulants Found in Supplements"" or ""Hidden Dangers in Dietary Supplements""  and wondered,  are supplements safe?     Indeed, the supplements industry has a long history of tainted products, which attracted attention in the late 1990s when the stimulant ma huang, or ephedra, was linked to organ damage and deaths and was consequently banned in 2004.   More recently, another banned substance, methylsynephrine (also called oxilofrine), has been found in supplements that did not list it on the label. Methylsynephrine is a pharmaceutical stimulant that increases blood pressure and stimulates the heart but which is not approved for use in the U.S. as either a supplement or prescription drug. It's also listed on the World Anti-Doping Agency's 2016 ""Specified Stimulants"" list, and a number of athletes who tested positive for the banned substance have claimed they unknowingly consumed methylsynephrine via contaminated sports supplements.   Both professional and amateur athletes are groups targeted by  and have paid the consequences for  adulterated supplements. Herbal remedies advertised for management of chronic diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and arthritis, or for weight management or erectile dysfunction, are also likely to be tainted. A 2016 study on the prevalence of methylsynephrine in dietary supplements analyzed 27 brands and found the substance present in 14 of them  with doses ranging from 0.0003 to 75 milligrams per cap or tablet. Researchers discovered that if consumers took the recommended dose listed on the label, they could potentially consume as much as 250 milligrams per day and experience side effects including vomiting, agitation and cardiac arrest.   But methylsynephrine is not the only unlisted additive found in supplements. In a 2014 review of supplement contamination, additives designed to intensify the claimed effects of natural supplements were found. The study indicated that synthetic ingredients were not listed on labels  including approved pharmaceuticals or ones that are no longer approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration because of side effects.   Since the ephedra ban, other stimulants such as 1,3-dimethylamylamine, or DMAA, have emerged in supplements sold in the U.S. for weight loss, enhanced brain function and improved athletic performance. And a collaborative product testing investigation by the public health organization NSF International found the stimulant N,a-diethyl-phenylethylamine, or N,a-DEPA, which is similar in structure to methamphetamine, in a sports supplement called Craze, which did not list it on the product label.   Since the FDA has no involvement with supplements until they are already on the market, many industry experts predict tainted products will likely continue to occur. But this is not to say that all supplements are dangerous.   In fact, millions of Americans successfully consume them without ill effect. Some supplements have shown to be beneficial for health, including folic acid taken by women of childbearing age for birth defect reduction or vitamin B12 taken by people over 50 experiencing reduced ability to absorb the nutrient from food. In addition, calcium and vitamin D are routinely recommended for bone health, and iron and other vitamins and minerals are regularly taken for anemia.   When supplements are advised by a medical professional to target specific needs, they can be beneficial to health. While people should attempt to get the majority of their nutrients from food, that is not always possible for some populations or individuals with certain conditions. The FDA recommends consumers consult with a medical professional before using dietary supplements, given the potential for strong biological effects and the need to establish a safe dose based on individual needs.   In addition, consumers who choose to supplement should use caution and look for independent quality assessment seals and third-party verification for added safety.

I've wanted to be a physician as long as I can remember, which is odd because there are none in my family. I chose to become a family physician because I wanted a relationship with those I would serve.   A mentor once told me that the greatest compliment anyone could ever give is to have you present at their birth and their death. And as a family physician, that's what I experienced. Even before I joined the BoD of the Academy, I recognized RDs as valued members of our care team. My practice had RDs working with us since 1978. And so, as a member of that Board and as a contributor since, I continue to work with important colleagues in providing care.   What or who inspires you?  There have been so many role models and mentors that inspired me over the many years, but one stands out. He's not famous or well known, but he's the same wise family doctor from the ""old school"" who said those words above, and many more.

Karen Jackson-Holzhauer: Hero for Healthy Aging
She believes nourishing food is the centerpiece of wellness",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Winter-2012/Karen-Jackson-Holzhauer-Hero-for-Healthy-Aging/,"I became a registered dietitian at the birth of the whole foods, ecology movement and have supported community-based initiatives throughout my career, says Karen Jackson-Holzhauer, MA, RD, FADA, who works in Southfield, Mich., for the Area Agency on Aging 1-B. The belief that nourishing food is the centerpiece of wellness has shaped her career in healthy aging.     Jackson-Holzhauer manages nutrition services at AAA-1B, which provides meal delivery to individuals homes, senior centers, elder housing and other community venues. She also serves on the board of the  National Association of Nutrition and Aging Services  Programs to advocate and serve the needs of older adults, and has volunteered with the  American Heart Association  helping launch grocery store tours and cooking classes.     An interest in food as preventative medicine, coupled with a desire to understand a family history of early-onset heart disease, sparked Jackson's decision to study nutrition. You might say it runs in the family.     My mother was a nurse and interested in healthy eating. My paternal grandmother was a volunteer community dietitian during World War II for the Red Cross chapter in Michigan, and my maternal grandmother worked at the Kelloggs Sanitarium in Battle Creek with my great aunt, says Jackson-Holzhauer, who adds that when she and her father sampled the raw vegetables they grew in their backyard, he would describe his own garden education experience as a child in Henry Fords community garden program in the 1930s.     Jackson-Holzhauer credits her mentor, registered dietitian Marqueta C. Huyck at Wayne State University in Detroit, for igniting her passion to work with older adults in the 1970sleading to what Jackson calls a life-long learning path in the study of healthy aging. Already having earned a masters degree in diabetes education, Jacksons desire to explore the medicalization of aging and the global rise in diabetes inspired her to pursue a second graduate degree, this one in medical anthropology.     I had a lot of questions about the culture of medicine and the social, political, historical and economic forces that affect it, Jackson-Holzhauer says, and about the repositioning of nutrition in the medical world. I examined how people make decisions about what is healthy, and who makes these decisions, and was challenged as an anthropologist to understand from a cross-cultural perspective how people approach the future and the role of hope as a motivating factor in the choices they make."
"How to Build a Fertility-Friendly Food Foundation
Struggling with infertility can be a draining and exhausting life. But here's what we know: nutrition can help. In fact, good nutrition is sometimes unconsciously neglected by many people struggling with infertility",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/June-2016/How-to-Build-a-Fertility-Friendly-Food-Foundation/,"This featured post is by Sara Haas, RDN, LDN, and  Elizabeth Shaw, MS, RD, CLT . Follow Sara on Twitter  @cookinRD  and Elizabeth  @shawsimpleswaps .   Anyone who has struggled  to get pregnant knows the drill: map out a plan for every minute of ovulation, track dates and visit the reproductive endocrinologist's office so often you feel like you practically live there.   Struggling with infertility can be a draining and exhausting life. But here's what we know: nutrition can help. In fact,  good nutrition is sometimes unconsciously neglected by many people struggling with infertility.     Juggling all of the typical demands of daily life along with managing medications and visits to the doctor can be stressful and tiring. Feeling exhausted like that can lead to impulsive eating, causing a person to make less-than-nutritious food choices.   That's where dietitians can help. We can support those trying to get pregnant by educating them on the power of food and providing solutions that make eating healthfully easy. We can speak to the role food plays not only in nourishing and priming your body for conception, but for helping with mood and stress.   In fact, research from the Nurses' Health Study has shown certain foods can actually increase the likelihood of achieving conception and sustaining a healthy, viable pregnancy. Though we can't promise food is a magic pill that will cure infertility, we can promise it's helped us, our clients and countless others feel more in control in a situation that so often feels out of control.   Fertility-Friendly Foundation Foods   Whole Grains  Whole grains help regulate blood sugar. If a diet is high in refined carbohydrates, the pancreas has to work overtime, sending out insulin to drive blood sugar down. This results in a high level of insulin in your bloodstream, which some research has indicated can inhibit ovulation. Encourage clients to make at least 75 percent of their grains whole grains.   Full-Fat Dairy  Research has suggested that switching to full-fat dairy while trying to conceive can increase the odds of getting pregnant. When cream is removed in reduced fat and skim milk products, the sex hormone balance of the milk can be altered, which may affect ovulation and conception. Remember though: full-fat dairy products have more calories, so it's important to enjoy them in moderation.   Fruits and Vegetable  Besides being excellent sources of many vitamins and minerals, fruits and vegetables provide essential nutrients that have been shown to have a direct effect on male and female fertility. For instance, the antioxidant capacity of lycopene has been studied aggressively as a possible solution to male infertility caused by sperm membrane lipid peroxidation. While there is need for further research in this area, it's safe to say the longitudinal research of an overall healthy diet points to the importance of antioxidants in removing free radicals from our bodies.   Plant-Based Protein  Studies show that increasing plant-based protein through consumption of beans, legumes and protein-rich whole grains such as quinoa may continue to enhance your odds of conception.  The Fertility Diet , an excellent book by Dr. Walter Willett, includes great information about the importance of nutrition and plant-based protein on fertility.

"Nutrition for a Breastfeeding Mom
With some pre-baby planning and smart shopping, energy and milk supplies can be better for mom and baby",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/October-2014/Nutrition-for-a-Breastfeeding-Mom/,"This featured post is by  Gina Lesako, RD, LD . You can follow this blogger  @GLesako .   10/28/2014: This blog post was edited to include certain references and updated content. Updated content is in bolded text.   Breastfeeding has a host of nutritional benefits that will promote your childs health and growth. It also takes a toll on the mothers nutritional stores and energy. But with some pre-baby planning and smart shopping, energy and milk supplies can be better for mom and baby. Here are some tips:   Calories and Fluid   The average woman needs anywhere from 1,500-2,000 calories, based on activity level. Nursing moms need more: 2,000-2,500 calories (more if nursing twins) daily, along with at least 108-oz. glasses of water. To make up a 500-calorie deficit, consider a few healthy choices that will also help with weight loss over time:     Two tablespoons of peanut butter has 200 calories and 7 g protein.   One small container of full-fat Greek yogurt can have 180 calories and 15 g protein.   Adding two tablespoons of full-fat balsamic dressing to a salad with half an avocado will add an additional 300 calories.   Avoid sugary drinks (juices, carbonated beverages) and sweets, as this will slow down on some of the postpartum weight loss.      Proper hydration is also crucial for nursing mothers. ChooseMyPlate.gov recommendsdrinking enough fluids, especially water, to quench your thirst.   Nutrients   Calcium consumption is crucial for both nursingmothers and their babies.  Mother can obtainthis nutrient in foods such asdairy products, non-dairy fortified products (almond or soy milk), fish, dark leafy greens, fortified cereals and tofu. New moms should stock up on fortified cereals as they are shelf-stable and consider using frozen leafy greens to add to omelets, pastas and soups.   Iron   Iron is crucial during the postpartum period. Doctors will usually test for iron and recommend supplementation if necessary, but the following foods will help with improving iron stores: fortified cereals, oysters, lean beef, tofu and spinach (when combined with an acid such as citrus or vinegar). Also, consider avoiding coffee, teasand legumes while consuming iron-rich foods as these can block iron absorption.    Caffeine   Sleepless nights and depleted iron stores make for exhausted parents. Coffee to the rescue? Excessive consumption of caffeine (three or more cups per day) may affect the breastfeeding infant. However, a morning cup of coffee is acceptable during breastfeeding. Keep in mind that the later you drink coffee the later its in the breast milk, which might keep baby up later.    Seafood   Low-mercury fish can be eaten twice a week. Good options are cod, haddock, pollock, shrimp, tilapia and light tuna. Farm-raised salmon can be eaten twice a month along with herring and sardines, but keep in mind they contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), which, in high numbers, can cause neurological problems and development delays in babies.   Alcohol   Once the baby is on an established breastfeeding schedule, around age three months, mom may have a chance to imbibe. Alcohol passes into breast milk so  ChooseMyPlate.gov recommendspumping or breastfeeding before having a drink. Or, waitfour hours after drinking before pumping or nursing to ensure the alcoholis completely out of the mothers system.

"Besting Breastfeeding Bullies: A Case for Supporting, Not Shaming
Has the ""breast is best"" mantra gone too far in perpetuating these feelings among women who cannot, or choose not, to breastfeed",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/September-October-2014/Besting-Breastfeeding-Bullies-Support-Not-Shame/,"""Breast is best"" has long been the mantra to new mothers and is a favorite among many registered dietitian nutritionists.     There's no shortage of good reasons for moms to breastfeed their infants; numerous studies point to the nutritional and health benefits of breast milk, including reduced risk of ear infections, sudden infant death syndrome, obesity and respiratory illness, as well as improved maternal outcomes such as a reduced risk of ovarian and breast cancer, Type 2 diabetes and postpartum depression.     For some mothers, however, breastfeeding isn't an option  either because they can't breastfeed or they choose to formula-feed instead. And many of these moms report feeling shame and guilt about their situation.     Has the ""breast is best"" mantra gone too far in perpetuating these feelings among women who cannot, or choose not, to breastfeed?     Too Much Pressure?   ""Bullies"" may be a strong label to those who passionately believe that breast milk is the best food for babies  and in most cases, it is likely an unfair depiction of many breastfeeding advocates.     La Leche, an organization that fervently promotes breastfeeding via mother-to-mother support, is sometimes cited as one of the ""extremist"" breastfeeding groups. Although its approach may seem dogmatic to some, La Leche was founded in 1956 when formula was the go-to choice for mothers, and has dedicated the past 58 years to promoting the benefits of breastfeeding.     Over the years, campaigns and programs to boost breastfeeding among new mothers have been largely successful.     Research from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's 2014 Breastfeeding Report Card shows that more than three-quarters of moms begin breastfeeding their infant. Yet despite these promising stats, a study published in 2013 in Pediatrics found first-time moms who report problems and concerns with breastfeeding during the first few days after giving birth are nearly 10 times as likely to quit breastfeeding within two months.     Those findings aren't surprising to Ginger Carney, MPH, RD, LDN, IBCLC, FILCA, FAND, director of clinical nutrition and lactation consultant at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. ""It takes a village for a woman to successfully breastfeed,"" says Carney, noting there are many barriers that make breastfeeding more difficult than it has to be.     ""Some of these barriers start in the birth hospital when moms and babies are separated, or when formula is provided to mothers who are breastfeeding,"" she says. ""Other barriers that occur later include unwelcome looks when moms try to feed their babies in public or when new moms return to work and need to find a private place to pump.""     Much of Carney's work with new mothers is centered on dispelling myths and providing women with the education and tools to work around these barriers.     Katie Mulligan, MS, RDN, LDN, is an extension service dietitian at the University of Rhode Island whose own experience changed her perspective of formula. Trying to ""do the right thing"" by breastfeeding resulted in the hospitalization of her 5-day-old daughter while Mulligan waited for her milk to come in. With the help of a lactation consultant, Mulligan used formula to supplement her breast milk. ""You think that breastfeeding is natural. No one tells you that breastfeeding can be incredibly hard and heart-wrenching, and that you feel like the world's worst mom when it doesn't work out,"" Mulligan says.     Many other new moms agree; a 2012 study found that 43 percent of first-time mothers feel guilty about using formula instead of breastfeeding. ""My opinion was definitely different before I had a child,"" Mulligan says. ""Now I am much more open to formula as a perfectly good option for babies.""     Less Judgment, More Support   Babies not latching on properly, concerns over quantity of breast milk and pain during breastfeeding are typical situations that certified lactation consultant Freda Rosenfeld, IBCLC, encounters in her work with new moms. ""I'd say that in 80 percent of cases, I'm successful in helping women achieve their nursing goals,"" says Rosenfeld, adding that the operative phrase is their nursing goals.     While in an ideal world all women might exclusively nurse, Rosenfeld is also pragmatic: Medical conditions, use of medications, returning to work, fatigue and other factors influence how much, how long and if ever a woman can breastfeed, or if the addition of formula is needed. Each mother's goals, options and situations are different; important points for RDNs to consider and remember when counseling new mothers.     ""My belief is that every woman should first and foremost be educated about breastfeeding, and those who want to breastfeed should be helped to be successful,"" Rosenfeld says. ""But no one should ever be made to feel guilty about their choice or circumstance.""     Elizabeth Ward, MS, RD, author of  Expect the Best: Your Guide to Healthy Eating Before, During & After Pregnancy  (Wiley 2009) couldn't agree more. ""Women need support for their decisions, not pressure or shame,"" says Ward. ""Being happy is the greatest gift you can give your baby, and if that means no breastfeeding and using formula instead, then that's the best choice.""     But sometimes, that's easier said than done. Like many moms-to-be, Massachusetts-based dietitian Dianne Rishikof, MS, RDN, LDN, always assumed that she would breastfeed, but medical issues thwarted her plans. A conversation with her cousin  a pediatrician who holds a strong ""breast milk only"" stance  left her devastated and feeling like a failure. While reassurance from both her own doctor and pediatrician that using formula would not harm her baby's health helped ease her worries and anxiety, the seesaw feelings of guilt continued for months, perpetuated in part by parenting books she read.     Only after her son turned 6 months old and it was clear that he was nourished, healthy and attached to her did Rishikof come to terms with her circumstances. ""I am at peace with this choice that was taken away from me, but I still feel like I need to say 'for medical reasons' whenever I talk about bottle feeding my kids,"" says Rishikof. ""And that need for defensive justification speaks volumes to the pressure or judgment that I must still feel.""     Mulligan has spoken out against the pressures mothers face feeling like they are failures if they don't breastfeed and has found support among fellow RDNs, for the most part. However, she says, ""There are dietitians who think we should 'warn mothers of the dangers of formula'  that's an exact quote  and that type of thinking does nothing but harm, to the mother and to you, as a health professional.""     Using formula to feed a baby is sometimes a conscious choice and other times a decision that's out of a mother's control. Either way, health professionals' roles are to provide less judgment and more support and encouragement  and, of course, science-based nutrition education free from personal bias.

"Does Celiac Disease Cause Infertility?
It’s commonly known that around 1 percent of the population has celiac disease — a severe autoimmune reaction to gluten — and we often think of it as a gastrointestinal disorder. But celiac is four to eight times more common in women who are experiencing infertility without any other known cause",http://www.foodandnutrition.org/Stone-Soup/April-2013/Does-Celiac-Disease-Cause-Infertility/,"This featured post is by  Cheryl Harris, MPH, RD . You can follow this blogger  @CherylHarrisRD .       Infertility is one of the hardest things for couples who want children, and celiac disease is frequently an overlooked cause.     Its commonly known that around 1 percent of the population has  celiac disease   a severe autoimmune reaction to  gluten   and we often think of it as a gastrointestinal disorder. But celiac is four to eight times more common in women who are experiencing infertility without any other known cause.This is a particularly tricky issue, because many of these women are not experiencing any of the typical celiac tummy troubles, and most dont even have anemia, which is often the most visible sign of celiac.     Many doctors now suggest screening for celiac when there isnt another obvious cause for infertility. Its also a much simpler and less invasive test than many of the infertility procedures. If youre reading this, most likely celiac already is on your radar screen, but you know as well as I do that this isnt universal. Since theres such a genetic link involved, if you have family members who are experiencing infertility or miscarriages, or if you know people experiencing infertility, do consider passing this information along! (Gently, of course, to people who you think might be open to it.)     Whats Causing the Infertility?     With untreated celiac disease, every time the mom-to-be eats gluten, her body attacks the small intestine, which often causes nutritional deficiencies. Obviously this makes it harder to get pregnant and to have a healthy pregnancy. The nutrients people with celiac arent absorbing well are the same ones that grow babies: such as iron, vitamin D, B vitamins, zinc, magnesium, calcium, etc.     But theres more than that. An untreated autoimmune disease  even without  nutrient deficiencies isnt good for mom or baby. The same tissue transglutaminase antibodies that doctors look at to identify active celiac disease and how patients are responding to a  gluten-free  diet can actually interfere with pregnancy. According to Daniel Leffler, MD, MS, director of clinical research at the Celiac Center at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, It turns out that antibodies affect the placenta in negative ways. We thought they were just good diagnostic markers, but they also seem to bind to and wreak havoc on many areas of the body.     This also means that moms-to-be will have the best chance of a healthy pregnancy if they wait six months or until the tTg (tissue transglutaminase) levels are back to normal and nutritional deficiencies are corrected. Because, at the end of the day, the goal is not just getting pregnant, but having a happy, healthy baby.     Dont Forget Dad     We tend to focus on the mom, but if the dad has untreated celiac,  he  may be the cause of infertility. Vitamins A and E and zinc are critical to sperm production. And one study even showed that fathers with untreated celiac were five times more likely to have low-birth weight babies.     Smart Steps and Tips     So, if you want to get pregnant and have celiac disease, make sure youve checked with your doctor about nutritional deficiencies and your thyroid, too. People with celiac are more likely to have autoimmune thyroid diseases, too, such as Hashimotos or Graves, which often show up during and after pregnancy.     Its also critical to make sure youre eating a balanced diet. Most  gluten-free  products arent fortified the way regular products are, and  many are both higher calorie and higher in empty, starchy carbs , too. The nutrients that are low in the diets of women with on a gluten-free diet (iron, B vitamins, calcium, fiber) are needed by both mom and baby.     Snacks can be the hardest, because its typical to reach for whatever is lying around. But for most people who eat gluten-free, a little planning goes a long way.
