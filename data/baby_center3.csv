Meal planning during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_meal-planning-during-pregnancy_1352495.bc,"It's easy to feel overwhelmed by pregnancy nutrition advice and worry that your diet will never measure up. But eating well when you're pregnant doesn't need to be difficult: A few simple, online tools can help you make sure you're getting the nutrients you and your baby need.Here's a look at general nutrition guidelines and how you can use them to plan meals during your pregnancy.MyPlateYou may remember the Food Guide Pyramid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which outlined how many daily servings you should eat from different categories of food. That pyramid has been adapted to become MyPlate, a system for choosing healthy food based on the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans.The site even has a section onhealth and nutrition for pregnant and breastfeeding women, featuring a personalized tracking system that suggests meal plans based on your age, height, pre-pregnancy weight, activity level, and trimester.MyPlate divides food into five main groups  grains, fruit, vegetables, protein, and dairy  plus oils. To get an individualized meal plan with general guidelines on what to choose from each group, enter your information at ChooseMyPlate.gov.A sample MyPlate planHere's a quick look at the MyPlate food groups and what a customized plan might recommend.This sample plan is designed for a 32-year-old woman who is 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighed 130 pounds before she got pregnant, is in her second trimester, and gets less than 30 minutes of daily physical activity. (Of course, your plan may be very different.)Grains: 7 ounces a dayGenerally, an ounce of grains equals one slice of bread, one small corn or flour tortilla, 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal, or 1/2 cup of cooked cereal, rice, or pasta. Get at least half of your daily grains from whole grains (like whole wheat bread or brown rice). Whole grains contain the most fiber, vitamins, and nutrients.Fruits: 2 cups a dayVary the color of the fruit you eat, and choose fresh over frozen or canned whenever possible. Many packaged varieties are preserved in sugary liquid, so choose products without added sugar.Bonus: The fiber in fruit helps prevent hemorrhoidsandconstipation, two common side effects of pregnancy.Vegetables: 3 cups a dayFresh vegetables taste better than canned or frozen, and they're also a better choice if you want to limit sodium and avoid preservatives. But when it comes to fiber and vitamins, plain canned and frozen veggies are just as nutritious as fresh. For maximum nutrition, vary the color of the vegetables you choose. Broccoli, for example, is packed with folate, calcium, and B vitamins. Sweet potatoes provide vitamin A, vitamin C, and fiber.Meat and beans: 6 ounces a dayThis equals about two servings that are each about the size of a deck of cards. Choose lean meat and limitfishto 12 ounces per week. (More than that may expose your baby to potentially harmful levels of mercury.)Dairy: 3 cups a dayIn the MyPlate plan, 1 cup of dairy equals 1 cup of milk or yogurt, 1 1/2 ounces of natural cheese, and 2 ounces of processed cheese. In general, dairy products are a great source of calcium and protein.Fats and oils: 6 teaspoons a dayThe best sources include canola oil, olive oil, safflower oil, fatty fish, avocados, nuts, seeds, and olives. Note: An avocado is a fruit, but it's included in the oils category because most of its calories come from fat.Discretionary calories: 266 a dayThis MyPlate sample plan budgets 266 ""extra"" calories that you use how you like, but you must include them in your daily calorie budget. In other words, you could have a scoop of ice cream or put some sugar in your decaf iced tea, but these discretionary calories count toward your daily total (2,200 in this case). How it all adds upOnce you've created your daily food plan, don't try to hit exact numbers in each category. Instead, shoot for an average that's in the desired range over the course of a week or so.As your pregnancy progresses, you'll need to eat a little more because your nutrition needs changeduring the different stages of pregnancy.If you eat roughly the amount recommended for each food group, take a prenatal vitamin daily, and consistently gain a reasonable amount of weight (about a pound per week in the second and third trimesters), you and your baby will be well nourished.The Harvard Healthy Eating PlateNot everyone agrees that the USDA's MyPlate is the best model for good nutrition. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have created their own eating guide, called theHealthy Eating Plate, which they believe better reflects current research on a balanced diet.The Harvard Healthy Eating Plate puts greater emphasis on whole grain foods, recommends healthy vegetable oils, and encourages limiting milk and dairy products to one or two servings a day. It also suggests limiting red meat (and avoiding processed meat altogether) and refined grains, such as white bread and white rice.The Healthy Eating Plate also encourages drinking plenty of water and skipping sugary drinks, and highlights the importance of daily exercise.Harvard's plan encourages you to eat more vegetables because most Americans don't eat enough from this important food group. One exception: Unlike the USDA's MyPlate, the Healthy Eating Plate does not include potatoes in its list of recommended vegetables. That's because potatoes are full of rapidly digested starch and have the same effect on blood sugar as sweets.Which model is best to follow during pregnancy?You can't go wrong with either version. Because experts don't completely agree, you can expect to find slight variations in their recommendations, but the two plans have plenty in common.Even if you can't follow either program to the letter, each gives you something to strive for, says Alan R. Fleischman, neonatologist and medical director of the March of Dimes. Eating nutritiously during pregnancy can pay huge dividends for the rest of your baby's life.""We know that some simple dietary changes can greatly improve the chances of having a healthy baby. For example, consuming 400 micrograms of the B vitaminfolic acidevery day before pregnancy begins and during early pregnancy significantly reduces the risk of a serious birth defect of the brain and spine,"" says Fleischman. ""Poor nutrition during pregnancy has lifelong effects on the growth and development of your baby. It's more important to eat wisely during pregnancy than practically any other time in life.""Do these food guidelines always apply?There are five exceptions to the guidelines. If any of these apply to you, or if you have other concerns, talk to your healthcare provider about your personal nutritional needs.If you're significantlyoverweight, you might do better with fewer calories, but talk to your provider to make sure you're getting the nutrients your baby needs.If you're significantlyunderweight, you'll need to get more calories.If you're a teenager, you'll also need more.If you're expectingmultiples, you'll have additional nutrition needs.If you developgestational diabetesor have pre-existing diabetes, a registered dietitian can help you plan your diet. It will emphasize eating whole foods and getting a consistent amount of carbohydrates at each meal. You'll also need to monitor your blood sugar levels closely and communicate regularly with your team of healthcare providers.Sample menu for a pregnant womanHere's an example of a daily menu specifically designed for our ""sample mom,"" with a few extra snack suggestions.

Tips for preschoolers: Healthy snacks and meals,https://www.babycenter.com/0_tips-for-preschoolers-healthy-snacks-and-meals_10387681.bc,"Teach your preschooler to savor delicious and nutritious food by serving a variety of healthy meals and snacks. Here are a few tips to get you started.Get your preschooler to helpTap into your child's curiosity and enlist his help to come up with creative recipes. Take your preschooler shopping with you and let him pick out whatever fresh fruit or vegetable catches his fancy. Kids are more likely to eat and enjoy what they choose to make.Keep servings smallHow much your preschooler needs to eat daily depends on her age, weight, and activity level. Most 2- to 4-year-olds eat between 1,000 and 1,600 calories a day.A healthy portion size for a preschooler is a quarter to a half of an adult portion. There's no need to count calories  just remember to adjust portions accordingly.Go for low-fat or no fatIntroduce fat-free and low-fat versions of favorite foods like yogurt, cheese, and milk. Gradually decrease the amount of fat your preschooler consumes until it's about a third of his total calories by the age of 4 or 5. Avoid foods with lots of saturated fat and instead offer your child a variety of foods with good fats, like avocados and peanut butter.Cut it upUntil children reach the age of 4, they can't chew food very well. Cut your preschooler's snack into bite-size pieces. If you're serving vegetables, cook them first so they're soft, then chop them so they're easy to eat. Foods that may cause young children to choke include peanuts, whole grapes, whole cherry tomatoes, carrots, pumpkin or sunflower seeds, chunks of peanut butter, celery, and cherries with pits.Be flexibleIt's not unusual for kids this age to do an about face when it comes to their favorite food. Your child may want the same lunch several days in a row, then suddenly decide he doesn't like it anymore. It can be frustrating, but try not to make a big deal about it.Have other healthy choices on hand. If you're offering something he hasn't tried before, just give him a tiny bit and serve it alongside a familiar food. And don't insist that he eat a full portion of something he's not used to.Cook togetherIf your preschooler helps make a meal, she's more likely to want to eat it. Give her age-appropriate jobs in the kitchen, like washing vegetables, measuring and adding ingredients, and cutting soft fruits and vegetables. Cooking together  and sharing in the cleanup afterward  is an excellent way to foster good feelings about food.Keep it simpleEven if you love to cook, it's hard to find the time when you have young children. Luckily, you can prepare nutritious food your child will love in just minutes.Check out our fresh ideas for quick and healthy breakfasts, snacks, and lunches  including packed lunches for preschool and day trips.For more inspiration, browse our Meal Planning & Recipes area."
Managing gestational diabetes,https://www.babycenter.com/0_managing-gestational-diabetes_10415151.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI have gestational diabetes. Will I see my doctor more often?Once you know you have gestational diabetes, you'll probably see your healthcare provider at least every two weeks. If you take insulin or another medication, you may need to see your provider once a week.In your third trimester, you may have one or more ultrasound exams to check how your baby is growing. If you take medications to control your diabetes, you may also have a fetal nonstress test once or twice a week. This is a safe test which measures your baby's movements and heartbeat.It's important to go to all your prenatal appointments, even if you're feeling well. Your provider will need to monitor you and your baby regularly and may adjust your treatment plan based on the results of your tests.What will I need to do if I have gestational diabetes?The key to managing your condition is tracking your blood sugar levels. This helps you take control of your condition and be sure that your treatment plan is working.Your healthcare provider will show you how to test your own blood sugar using a special device. This involves pricking your finger with a small surgical blade called a lancet. Although some women find it unpleasant at first, it isn't usually painful.Your provider will tell you how often to test your blood sugar. Usually, you need to test yourself first thing in the morning before you eat or drink anything, and then one or two hours after each meal.If you have trouble controlling your blood sugar, you may need to test more often. If your blood sugar is normal most of the time, you may be able to test less often.Your provider will also recommend lifestyle changes to help you to manage your gestational diabetes. Your blood sugar levels will show if these changes are working.What lifestyle changes do I need to make?To control your blood sugar, be sure to:Eat well. A healthy diet is key to managing your gestational diabetes. Plan to eat three medium-size meals every day, with two to three small snacks in between. Opt for whole grains, lean proteins, and vegetables over sugary, processed foods. Your provider may refer you to a registered dietitian who can help you create a healthy meal plan that's easy to stick to.Exercise regularly. Some providers advise moderate exercise to help balance blood sugar. Try to exercise for about 30 minutes, at least five times a week. You could head outside for a brisk walk, enjoy a swim, or try a pregnancy yoga class. Always check with your provider before starting a new exercise program.What should I do if my blood sugar is high?Several factors contribute to high blood sugar (hyperglycemia), including what and how much you eat. If you're taking medication, the timing of when you take that medication can have an effect too. Most often high blood sugar doesn't cause any symptoms, but some people notice an increase in thirst or urination.A vital part of managing high blood sugar is to know when and why it happens. Then you can work with your provider to plan what to eat and when to take your medication to suit your individual needs. Here are some simple steps for managing your condition:Track your blood sugar levels.Keep a diary to record information about what you eat, when you take your medication, and what type of exercise you get how often. Writing all this down in addition to the results of your blood tests lets you and your provider see if there's a pattern to spikes. You may notice certain foods or combinations of foods are more likely to lead to high blood sugar.Discuss your diary with your provider or a dietitian so you can work out lifestyle changes to help you continue to manage your blood sugar levels.What should I do if my blood sugar is low?Low blood sugar is called hypoglycemia. People taking insulin or other medications that lower blood sugar are at risk for hypoglycemia. It's important to treat low blood sugar quickly.The symptoms of low blood sugar include:hungerheadachedizzinesssweatinganxietyrapid heartbeatYour provider may recommend that you carry glucose tablets or candy with you in case your blood sugar drops too low. Talk to your provider if you have two or more episodes of low blood sugar during one week.Do I need to take medication?Maybe. But most women  about 85 percent  find that they can manage gestational diabetes with diet and exercise.If blood sugar is high despite making lifestyle changes, your provider will prescribe insulin or an oral medication. Insulin can't be taken in tablet form, so your provider will show you how to give yourself injections. You'll need to give yourself up to three injections each day.Insulin treatment aims to bring down your blood sugar so it's at the same level as a woman who doesn't have gestational diabetes. Insulin is safe to take in pregnancy.If you take insulin or any other medication, follow your provider's instructions for how and when to take it. Go to all your prenatal appointments because your medication may need to be adjusted.Taking medication doesn't mean you can eat what you like. You still need to eat a balanced, healthy diet and exercise regularly. You also need to test your own blood sugar as recommended by your doctor.How can I make sure I stick to the plan?Being diagnosed with gestational diabetes can be stressful. It's natural to feel apprehensive about trying to manage your condition, especially if you already feel tired or overwhelmed.At first, your new meal plan may seem boring or restrictive, and you may find yourself feeling resentful about having to make these changes. You may also find it hard to get motivated to exercise.But remember that by sticking to your treatment plan, you're doing your best to ensure a successful pregnancy and a healthy outcome for you and your baby. Remind yourself that this situation won't last forever. Gestational diabetes is likely to go away as soon as your baby's born.However, the risk of developing type 2 diabetes in later life is much higher. So the lifestyle changes you make when you're pregnant can help you stay healthy in the long term.Here are some other ideas to help you follow your plan:Get your partner or other family members involved. It may be easier to change what you eat if you aren't alone. Ask your partner or another family member to join you in cutting out added sugar and eating healthy, balanced meals.Choose an exercise you enjoy. Find a form of exercise that that you've always wanted to try, or at least one that doesn't feel like a chore. You could sign up for a pregnancy yoga or Pilates class, or get some friends together for a walk. You may end up enjoying being active and appreciating the extra energy that exercise gives you.Find other ways to treat yourself. If you're missing candy, cakes, or soda, find an alternative treat to look forward to. A pregnancy massage or a day out with friends can boost your motivation and keep you from feeling deprived.Ask for help. Let your provider know if you're having trouble sticking to your treatment plan. She can offer extra support and advice, or recommend a dietitian who can help if your food choices seem uninspiring.It's worth remembering that the changes you're being asked to make will be good for your general health in the long term as well as helping you manage your condition now.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015a.

Dietary fats in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_dietary-fats-in-your-pregnancy-diet_1694.bc,"The value of fats in your pregnancy dietFats are an essential part of a healthy diet, but some fats are better for you than others. Your goal (whether or not you're pregnant) is to make sure you get adequate ""good"" fats in your diet while minimizing the ""bad"" fats.Some fats (and the fatty acids they contain) are especially important during pregnancy because they support your baby's brain and eye development  both before and after birth. Fats also help the placenta and other tissues grow, and studies show that some fats may help prevent preterm birth and low birth weight.Which fats to eat during pregnancyThere are four kinds of fat in food: monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, saturated, and trans fat. Each type of fat is made up of a combination of fatty acids, so fats don't typically fall into just one of these categories. Palm oil and lard, for example, are roughly half monounsaturated and half saturated fat, with a bit of polyunsaturated fat as well. But for the most part, you can follow these guidelines for which fats to avoid and which to eat in moderation:Monounsaturated fats are found in olive, canola, and peanut oils, as well as in olives, avocados, nuts, and nut butters. They're considered ""good"" fats because they're best at lowering cholesterol.Polyunsaturated fats are beneficial too. They contain omega-3 fatty acids, like DHA and ALA (both of which are crucial for your baby's healthy development), and omega-6 fatty acids. Omega-3s are found in some cold-water fish, flax seed oil, walnuts, and canola oil, and omega-6s are found in sunflower, cottonseed, corn, and soybean oils. (Soybean oil, found in many salad dressings and processed foods, also contains some omega-3s.)Pregnancy weight gain trackerSee your target weight range for pregnancy and whether your weight gain is on track.Fish can be an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids, and pregnant women are encouraged to eat 8 to 12 ounces of seafood per week. But some types of fish contain contaminants such as mercury. Choose seafood high in DHA and low in mercury, such as salmon, anchovies, sardines, and herring.Learn more about which fish are safest to eat during pregnancy.Many monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats contain vitamin E, an important antioxidant often missing in the typical American diet.Saturated fats fall into the category of ""bad"" fats. Eat as little of these as possible, and limit them to less than 10 percent of your total calories. Saturated fats are found in high-fat meats, whole and 2 percent milk, tropical oils (such as palm kernel and coconut), butter, and lard. Saturated fats are usually solid at room temperature, unlike unsaturated fats.Trans fats (also known as hydrogenated and partially hydrogenated fats) are to be avoided as much as possible. These fats, which also are typically solid at room temperature, are found in fried foods and some kinds of margarine. They're also used in some packaged foods  like crackers, cookies, and chips  to extend the shelf life of these products. Read the nutrition facts label to find the amount of saturated and trans fat in a product, but keep in mind that trans fat is only listed if there's more than 0.5 grams.A diet high in saturated fat or trans fat can raise your cholesterol and may put you at risk for heart disease. Studies show that saturated and hydrogenated fats may also be linked to other health problems, such as cancer and diabetes.Don't beat yourself up if you indulge in some fried chicken or a bag of chips on occasion. Just try to replace unhealthy fats with healthy fats as often as possible. How much fat to eat during pregnancyThere's probably no need to increase your fat consumption during pregnancy, but finding the right balance is important  aim to get most of the fats in your diet from plant sources.According to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), less than 10 percent of your daily calories should come from saturated fat. Here's how to figure out the upper limit for the number of grams of saturated fat you should consume in a day, based on your current calorie intake: Divide the number of calories you eat in a day by 10, then divide that number by nine. (There are nine calories in 1 gram of fat.)To see how your physical activity level and pre-pregnancy weight affect the amount of fats you need, use the USDA's SuperTracker tool to get a personalized daily meal plan. The meal plan will include food group recommendations that feature the appropriate amount of fats for you during your pregnancy.Good fat choices during pregnancyMonounsaturated fatsEach of the following contains 5 grams of fat and 45 calories:2 tablespoons (1 ounce) avocado1 teaspoon safflower, olive, canola, or peanut oilsix almonds or cashews10 peanutsfour pecan halves1 1/2 teaspoons nut butters (trans fat free): almond, peanut, cashewtwo Brazil nutsfive hazelnuts (filberts)three macadamia nutseight large black olives10 large green olives with pimento16 pistachiosPolyunsaturated fatsEach of the following contains 5 grams of fat and 45 calories:1 teaspoon margarine, trans fat free1 teaspoon regular mayonnaise1 tablespoon reduced-fat mayonnaisefour walnut halves (omega-3)1 tablespoon flax seed (omega-3)1 teaspoon flax oil (omega-3)1 teaspoon sunflower, corn oil, or soybean oil (omega-6)1 tablespoon regular salad dressing2 tablespoons reduced-fat salad dressing1 tablespoon pumpkin seeds (omega-3), sesame seeds, or sunflower seeds1 tablespoon pine nuts2 teaspoons tahiniMany foods are now fortified with omega-3s. Check the labels on eggs, milk, soy beverages, orange juice, yogurt, bread, cereal, and margarine. Fats to avoid during pregnancySaturated fatsThough the portions below equal one serving of fat, these are the ones to avoid:one slice bacon (regular or turkey)1 teaspoon butter2 tablespoons shredded coconut1 tablespoon regular cream cheese1 1/2 tablespoons reduced-fat cream cheese1 tablespoon heavy cream1 teaspoon shortening or lard2 tablespoons regular sour cream3 tablespoons reduced-fat sour cream1 teaspoon coconut, palm, or palm kernel oilTrans (hydrogenated) fatsFried foods, such as french fries, donuts, and churrosMargarine that has the word ""hydrogenated"" on the ingredient listPeanut butter made with hydrogenated oilCookies, cakes, crackers, pies, turnovers, and candy made with hydrogenated vegetable oilsEasy ways to reduce harmful fats in your pregnancy dietSwitch oils. If you've been cooking or baking with hydrogenated fats, like stick margarine or shortening, substitute canola or safflower oil. (They have the highest smoke point.) Olive oil and flax seed oil are great for salad dressings.Replace some of the meat in your diet. Try toasted nuts instead of bacon bits in your salad, and eat two or three 4-ounce servings of fish instead of meat every week.When you do eat meat, choose lean cuts and avoid ones with marbling. Because leaner cuts of meat are sometimes not as moist, use marinades and slow cooking methods to enhance their texture.Skim the fat off the top of soups and stews before serving.Cut your cheese consumption. Don't order that double cheese pizza, and put half as much cheese in homemade casseroles or similar dishes. You can usually use less cheese if you choose one with a stronger flavor (sharp cheddar instead of mild, for example). Use mashed avocado on your burger in place of cheese.When eating at a fast food restaurant, avoid fried food and choose a smaller grilled burger or grilled chicken sandwich. Have a fruit salad or side salad instead of fries.Replace fat-laden snacks with healthier options, like fruits and vegetables and whole grains.Replace 2 percent and full-fat dairy products with low-fat or nonfat versions.Remove skin from poultry before cooking.Keep an eye out for fats on restaurant menus. Tip-off words: pan-fried, crispy, creamy, creamed, fried, au gratin, hollandaise, escalloped, and buttery. Ask for grilled, baked, or steamed fish, meat, and vegetables instead.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015. Nutrition during pregnancy.

Diet for gestational diabetes,https://www.babycenter.com/0_diet-for-gestational-diabetes_10415154.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI have gestational diabetes. Do I have to watch what I eat?Yes. Eating well helps all women stay healthy during pregnancy. But if you have gestational diabetes, choosing the right food to eat is even more important. That's because many women with gestational diabetes can manage their condition by following a healthy eating plan, monitoring their blood sugar, and exercising regularly.Keeping your blood sugar stable by eating healthy food and exercising makes it less likely that you'll need medication to control your condition. You and your baby are also less likely to have any complications from your condition.Watching what you eat also helps you gain a healthy amount of weight during pregnancy. If you were overweight before becoming pregnant, your healthcare provider may recommend limiting calories so you don't gain too much as your baby grows.Do I need to monitor carbohydrates?Yes. The amount and type of carbohydrates (natural starches and sugars) in food affects your blood sugar levels. And with gestational diabetes, you'll need to track your carbohydrate intake in particular.Setting a limit on the amount of carbohydrates you eat at each meal is the first step to managing your blood sugar. Your provider is likely to recommend reducing the total amount of carbohydrates to about 40 percent of your daily calories.Try to eat carbohydrates that are high in fiber. Fibrous foods are harder to digest.Whole grains are high in fiber, so choosing brown rice and whole grain bread instead of refined versions (white bread and rice) means that they take longer to digest and release sugar more slowly into your bloodstream. Vegetables, beans, lentils, and chickpeas are also high in fiber and release sugar into your blood slowly.Avoid food and drinks that are high in added sugars, such as candy, cakes, and sodas. If you're craving something sweet, artificial sweeteners such as aspartame (NutraSweet and Equal) and sucralose (Splenda) are fine in moderation.Lean proteins should make up about 20 percent of what you eat each day. Fish, lean meat, and low-fat milk and dairy products are healthy protein choices.The remainder of your calories should come from healthy (unsaturated) fats, such as olive oil. That's about 40 percent of your daily calories.Avoid unhealthy (saturated) fats, such as butter, and trans (hydrogenated) fats, like those found in processed foods. Foods like all-natural peanut butter are high in healthy fat and a good source of protein, but check labels because peanut butter can have trans fat.If all this seems overwhelming, know that you don't have to make these changes on your own. Your provider will give you plenty of information to guide you when making food choices. She can also refer you to a registered dietitian to help with meal planning.How can I keep my blood sugar stable?When you're trying to control gestational diabetes, what you eat isn't the only factor to consider. How and when you eat is important too.The goal is to keep your blood sugar even and avoid the spikes that lead to blood sugar going up. This is even more critical if you do need to take medications to control your diabetes.Having some protein at each meal can help balance blood sugar. For example, eating a small portion of whole grain cooked cereal (like oatmeal) with an egg or yogurt at breakfast can balance your meal and prevent blood sugar spikes. All-natural peanut butter on whole wheat toast is another good option.Have three small meals, plus two to four healthy snacks, every day to keep your blood sugar level stable. Try to space these out evenly so you eat something every two to three hours. Having a snack before bedtime is especially important to keep your blood sugar levels from falling overnight.Repeated blood sugar spikes mean gestational diabetes is uncontrolled, which can lead to health problems for you and your baby.What are low glycemic index foods?The glycemic index (GI) ranks foods that contain carbohydrates based on how quickly they release energy, in the form of glucose, into your blood.Foods with a low glycemic index give a sustained release of energy. Because they take time to digest and turn to glucose gradually, foods low on the glycemic index are less likely to cause spikes in blood sugar and can help to control blood sugar levels.On the other hand, foods high on the glycemic index are digested rapidly and turn to glucose more quickly. This can make your blood sugar rise soon after meals.Knowing about the GI of some foods can help you plan meals when you're pregnant. But the GI of foods can be affected by many things, such as manufacturing process, combination of ingredients, ripeness, or how much it's cooked.Generally speaking, foods that are highly processed or cooked are more likely to have a higher GI, and foods that are raw or high in fiber have a lower GI. Highly processed foods are the biggest concern because they tend to be loaded with starches and added sugar.GI plans can be complicated to follow, and not everyone agrees that they are helpful if you have gestational diabetes. But if you're interested in learning more, ask your provider for advice.Low GI foods include:most fruits, especially apples, oranges, pears, peaches, and mangoesvegetables, such as broccoli, green beans, peas, yams, lettuce, cabbage, and carrotslegumes, such as beans, chickpeas, and lentilsbrown ricewhole oats, and whole-oat-based cereals, such as porridge, oat bran, muesli, and granolamultigrain and pumpernickel breadHigh GI foods include:fruit juiceready-to-eat cerealpizzasodawhite breadshort grain white ricerusset potatoesinstant oatsmacaroni cheese from mixsaltine crackersrice cakespretzelsI've been referred to a dietitian. What can I expect?You'll get medical nutrition therapy (MNT), which is a personalized eating plan you'll work out with your dietitian. This will take into account your weight and how many calories you need each day. A dietitian will talk to you about:how to count carbohydrateshow many carbohydrates to have dailywhen to consume carbohydratestiming insulin with food consumptionthe impact of exercise on diet and insulingetting the vitamins and minerals you need for a healthy pregnancyAs your pregnancy progresses, your dietitian may make changes to your MNT based on the results of blood sugar monitoring and how much weight you've gained. If you need to start taking insulin, you'll still need to follow an eating plan, but a dietitian will likely make some changes to take your treatment into account.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015a.

Helping a child who's underweight (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_helping-a-child-whos-underweight-ages-5-to-8_66923.bc,"How can I tell if my child is too skinny?There are several factors to take into consideration when evaluating your child's weight. Has he always been thin? Are both of his parents very thin? A child who has a genetic tendency to be thin is in a different boat than a child who has always been normal to hefty and who has recently stopped gaining  or started losing  weight. Even if your child has just recently thinned out, though, there may be nothing to worry about.""Keep in mind that a child's weight is dynamic and changes with growth,"" says Stephen R. Daniels, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition.When an increase in height precedes a gain in weight, Daniels explains, your child may appear underweight for a while, until his weight gain catches up. It's also possible, though, for your child's weight gain to eventually outstrip his gain in height, resulting in his becoming overweight. Doctors are very concerned that many children are becoming overweight as they grow older, Daniels says, and some of those children started out as underweight.The best way to determine whether your child is underweight  and to find out what to do about it  is to make an appointment with his doctor so she can help you evaluate his weight and his diet.How will the doctor determine whether my child is underweight?Your child's doctor will take into consideration the factors mentioned above  how much his parents weigh and how long he's been thin. She'll also evaluate your child's eating habits and his overall health. She'll probably ask if your child has had any medical problems that may have contributed to weight loss, like chronic diarrhea or vomiting.The doctor will measure your child's height and weight and plot these numbers on a growth chart. Doctors today are using a new series of growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that take into consideration a child's body mass index, or BMI, which considers weight together with height to help determine whether they are proportional. The BMI is a better indicator of body composition than a weight measurement alone. While an adult's BMI is calculated with a straight formula of height and weight, the formula to determine a child's BMI takes into consideration gender and age as well, to allow for the fact that body composition changes as a child gets older.If your child's BMI falls below the 5th percentile, he's considered underweight. The doctor will ask you questions about your child's diet, so she can pinpoint any major deficiencies. She may have you refer to the Food Guide Pyramid, so you can determine which food groups your child may not be getting enough of. She'll do a physical examination and may run laboratory tests to determine if there's an underlying medical cause, especially if your child seems to be eating well but not gaining weight. How can I help my child gain weight?Assuming your child has no underlying medical concerns, the idea will be to get him to take in more calories. For some children, simply adding foods that are ""heart-healthy"" sources of fat such as avocados, nuts, and vegetable oils  provides enough additional calories to meet the demands of growth. Try to plan healthy, calorie-dense meals and snacks for your child so he gets enough to eat.Whatever you do, don't feed your child ""junk food"" in an effort to promote weight gain, warns Daniels. Eating habits are ingrained early in life, and they may be difficult to change once they become established.Make mealtimes pleasant and unrushed. Sit down together whenever you can and enjoy your food and time together. Involve your child in meal planning, shopping (enlist his help picking out fruit at the market and bread at the bakery, for example), and food preparation, to encourage his interest in food and eating. Also, don't let your child get so wrapped up doing something that he skips meals. He needs to be eating frequently if you want him to gain weight.Here is a list of healthy high-calorie foods that you might offer your child:Dairy: Whole milk, cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, creamed soups, puddingProtein: Eggs, peanut butter, bean soups, nutsCarbohydrates: Bread, macaroni and cheese, pasta, French toast, pancakes, mashed potatoes, hot cerealIf your child is a picky eater and refuses to add new foods to his diet, his doctor may recommend a high-calorie supplement drink. These supplements taste like milkshakes and provide additional vitamins and minerals that your child may be missing out on.Make sure, though, that your child isn't filling up on beverages  like juices or even milk  so that he's not hungry for meals. Try to limit juice to no more than one cup a day and milk to no more than two cups a day.While you'll be eager to check on his progress, don't start subjecting your child to regular weigh-ins at home, because they may make him anxious and self-conscious about his weight. However, your doctor may want to see your child once a month to monitor his progress. Treat these visits like any other to the doctor, and don't make a big deal about the weigh-in process.What if my child doesn't start gaining weight?If your child is getting enough calories but still does not seem to be gaining weight appropriately, continue to work with his doctor to discover any underlying conditions. On the other hand, if your child is refusing to eat, there may be a psychological reason that you'll want to discuss with a child therapist. Your child's doctor can provide a referral.Chances are good, though, that with some patience and some conscientious meal and snack plans, your child will strike a good height/weight balance."
Nine ways to slash your family's spending,https://www.babycenter.com/0_nine-ways-to-slash-your-familys-spending_1497557.bc,"Look for hidden wasteCan you find a cheaper cell-phone plan, long-distance phone service, or Internet service provider? Is it time to refinance your mortgage or car payments? Can you raise your insurance deductibles to lower your premiums? What about canceling your landline and using only your cell phone?Are you getting your money's worth from your gym membership, or could you walk, jog, or play basketball for free in the park instead? You may want to consider becoming a one-car family to save on gas, insurance, and car maintenance.Ask your utility company how you can lower your payments. Some charge lower rates during off-peak hours or offer deals to customers who agree to cut back on their usage at peak times. Even simple changes, like turning down the temperature on your water heater or installing energy-saving showerheads, can bring your monthly bills down.Watch those credit cardsIf credit card charges are eating up a big chunk of your monthly budget, look into consolidating your balances or getting a lower interest rate. Examine your credit card statements: Are there automatic charges  such as for subscriptions to magazines you no longer read  that could be canceled?

See all videosPlan low-cost family vacationsInstead of staying in hotels, consider traveling with friends and renting a house together. This is usually cheaper than booking hotel rooms, and it allows you to cook meals instead of going to restaurants.Trading homes temporarily with people in other cities is even cheaper. You can do it nearby or far away, for a weekend or for much longer. Search online for ""home swap,"" ""vacation home exchange,"" or similar terms to find a service that facilitates exchanges between families.Other ideas: Travel locally so you can drive rather than fly. Carry a cooler full of snacks and sandwich ingredients so you don't have to eat out for every meal. Pack up the tent and go camping. (Get more tips for saving big on family travel.)Go co-op crazyForm a meal co-op with friends and neighbors  each family takes a night to make dinner for everyone. This saves time, builds community, introduces children to a broader variety of foods, and saves money by allowing participants to buy food in bulk (without having to eat the same food for weeks straight).A babysitting co-op may also be a good idea. By trading babysitting duties with other families you're close to, you can save money on childcare and know you're leaving your child with people you trust. Avoid restaurantsThe average American family eats out four times a week. That takes a big bite out of their budget, says Jonni McCoy, a mom and founder of the Miserly Moms website. You can save a lot by making relatively painless adjustments to your dining habits.On date night, leave the kids with friends and prepare a candlelit dinner at home instead of going out to eat. On workdays, bring your lunch to the office. On weekends, pack a picnic and take your family to the park or the beach. Take snacks to the playground, zoo, or movie theater instead of visiting the snack bar.You can also save money by making coffee at home  those fancy coffee drinks really add up. Splurge on your favorite beans and a travel mug and take yours to go. (One Baby Center reader figured that by breaking their specialty coffee habit, she and her husband could shave $2,000 a year off their budget!)Find cheaper entertainmentRather than renting movies, try borrowing them from your local library or downloading from a free movie site and watching on your computer. Consider canceling your premium cable service and instead subscribing to a DVD-by-mail or streaming service. If you really want to catch the latest release on the big screen, go to a matinee, which usually costs less.You can also get creative about finding ways to cut costs and create family time. Organize a family game night instead of going out, or make holiday presents together to save on gift-giving.Become a smart shopperStart with the food bill, McCoy advises. ""This is usually the largest category of spending, and there are so many ways to whittle it down,"" she says.Buy in bulk, clip coupons, and mail in rebates. (You can trade coupons with other parents on our ) Generics and store-brand products are almost always cheaper than name brands. (Get more tips for trimming the fat from your food budget.)For clothes, baby gear, furniture, and similar items, secondhand stores and resale shops have bargains galore, as do sites such as eBay and Craigslist. Or, if you're buying new, purchase clothing for next year during end-of-season sales. For furniture or appliances, ask for floor models  you probably won't notice a scratch on your new bed, but it could bring down the price significantly.And finally, skip the pricey salon and become a beauty school drop-in. Beauty schools offer discounts on services such as haircuts, facials, and mani-pedis. Keep a tight rein on your budgetStay-at-home mom Heather DeGeorge uses a simple envelope system: Every two weeks she takes the cash from her husband's paycheck and divvies it up into envelopes marked for specific expenses. So if she has budgeted $400 a month for groceries, she puts $200 into the grocery envelope every two weeks. Then she knows she'll have the money when it's time to go to the store.DeGeorge has envelopes for other fixed costs, as well as for luxuries. ""We budget a certain amount for eating out,"" she says. ""If there's no money in the 'eating out' envelope, we go to the pantry.""Similarly, you can use a separate bank account to make sure you have all the money you need tucked safely away for regular expenses. Add up the yearly total of all your fixed expenses, divide it by 12, and deposit that amount every month in your separate bill-paying account. Once you finesse this system, you'll never have to scramble to pay your property taxes or any other regular expense.Put in the timeIt's time-consuming to develop and maintain a budget, find the lowest prices, collect coupons, and shop for the best deals. It takes still more time to shop and cook in bulk, and to make presents instead of buying them.McCoy figures she devotes seven hours a week to keeping her household costs low. ""That includes everything: meal planning, shopping, making meals from scratch, and keeping track of spending,"" she says. ""When you consider the rewards, it really isn't that much."""

What eating for two really means,https://www.babycenter.com/eating-for-two,"Can I really eat twice as much now that I'm pregnant?No. You may sometimes be tempted to eat twice as much, but that's not what the doctor ordered.Your body becomes more efficient during pregnancy and is able to absorb more of the nutrients you eat. So consuming twice as much doesn't double your chances of having a healthy baby  instead, it's likely to mean excessive weight gain for you, which can put you at risk for pregnancy complications.While guidelines vary, the Institute of Medicine says if you're a healthy weight, you need no additional calories in the first trimester, 340 extra calories a day in the second trimester, and about 450 extra calories a day in the third trimester. If you're overweight or underweight, you'll need more or less than this depending on your weight gain goal.It takes only a couple of glasses of low-fat milk and a handful of sunflower seeds or a tuna sandwich to add enough calories for that last trimester. (But you'll need to eat more if you're having more than one baby.)Pregnancy Safety QuestionsOur experts answer your most pressing questions about what is and isn't safe during pregnancy.How can I get all the nutrients I need without eating a lot more calories?Here are some tips for maximizing nutrition during pregnancy:Plan meals and snacks based on the requirements outlined in the USDA Choose My Plate site for pregnant woman or another reliable source, like the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate. Learn more about meal planning for pregnancy.To meet your daily needs for protein, calories, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and key vitamins and minerals during pregnancy, eat a variety of foods. Even within a category of foods (like vegetables), look for different colors, types, and textures, for example.Try to minimize ""extra"" foods that have calories but few nutrients  sugary beverages, fried foods, foods with extra fat and sugar. Instead, choose meals and snacks that pack the most nutrition per calorie. Adding a few nutrition-packed snacks  like yogurt, nuts, a hard-boiled egg, some fresh fruits or vegetables  to your daily intake is a great way to get the healthy calories your baby needs.Choose foods that are as close to their natural state as possible. Pick whole-grain bread or brown rice over refined white bread or white rice, and fresh fruits or frozen unsweetened fruit over canned fruits in sugar syrup, for example.Eat fats, oils, and sweets sparingly. And be sure to choose healthy fats. Can't overcome your cravings for junk food? Discover some healthy  and delicious  alternatives.How is the food I eat divided between my needs and my baby's?Doctors don't understand exactly how you and your growing baby divvy up nutrients. Sustenance for your child comes from your diet and from the nutrients already stored in your bones and tissues.In the past, a developing fetus was thought of as a ""perfect parasite,"" taking all the necessary nourishment from the mother, regardless of her diet. This myth maintained that if your diet was deficient in, say, vitamin C, it didn't matter as far as the baby was concerned, because he could simply siphon the nutrient from you.Experts now believe that it's the growing baby who suffers if the mother's diet is lacking. Inadequate nutrition during pregnancy is thought to have lifelong effects on a baby's health.In a nutshell: Your baby's health and growth are directly related to what you eat before and during your pregnancy.What you eat is important. And when you're tempted to overdo it, remember that you're eating for a baby, not another full-size adult. Choose quality over quantity!Show sources Hide sources IOM. 2009.

Pregnant and underweight: How to get the nutrients you need,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pregnant-and-underweight-how-to-get-the-nutrients-you-need_1313894.bc,"How many pounds should I gain during pregnancy?Most women who start off their pregnancies underweight are advised to gain between 28 and 40 pounds  a bit more than the standard recommendation of 25 to 35 pounds. The March of Dimes suggests that if you begin your pregnancy underweight you try to gain slightly over a pound a week in the second and third trimesters (assuming you gain between 1 and 4 1/2 pounds in the first trimester).However, your doctor or midwife may make a different recommendation based on your individual situation, particularly if you have a history of eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia.If you need help gaining the extra weight, seek out a registered dietitian. (Ask your healthcare provider for a recommendation.)Not sure if you were underweight before you were pregnant? View a body mass index (BMI) chart to find out. You're considered underweight if you have a BMI of less than 18.5. (Your BMI reflects the relationship between your height and weight.)Pregnancy weight gain trackerSee your target weight range for pregnancy and whether your weight gain is on track.Does being underweight pose any risks to my baby or me?If you're underweight at the start of your pregnancy, you have a greater risk of having a preterm birth or a small for gestational age (SGA) baby. This puts the baby at risk for a host of problems. However, gaining enough weight  and gaining consistently throughout your pregnancy  reduces this risk.How can I make sure I'm getting all the nutrients I need?To begin with, like all pregnant women, you need to be taking a folic acid supplement to reduce your baby's risk of a neural tube defect. In fact, experts recommend taking 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid per day, beginning at least a month before you start trying to get pregnant. Some experts advise raising the dose to at least 600 mcg per day once you're pregnant.Other than that, the bulk of your nourishment should come from whole foods, but a prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement can help make up for some shortcomings. Your doctor or midwife will probably recommend that you start taking one as soon as you find out you're pregnant, if not before.If you're not sure you can stick to a healthy diet on your own, a registered dietitian can help you come up with a sensible meal plan and even provide you with simple recipes that include the foods rich in the vitamins and minerals that are essential to a healthy baby.Use our handy pregnancy food diary to make sure you're getting enough calories and nutrients and drinking plenty of water every day. The diary is also useful for tracking your mood and hunger levels, so you can spot patterns you may need to change.How can I stay on track with weight gain?Choose plenty of nutritious foods that contain some healthy fat and adequate calories. Here are four easy ways to get more calories:Eat breakfast every day. Add some peanut butter or a slice of cheese to your morning toast for an extra protein boost.Add a couple of slices of avocado and a handful of nuts or seeds to your salads for extra protein and healthy fat.Eat two or three snacks between meals. Choose foods like yogurt (for protein and calcium), dried fruit (for vitamins, minerals, and fiber), or a fruit and yogurt smoothie (for protein, calcium, vitamins, and minerals).Replace soda with milk (for protein and calcium) or juices that are high in vitamin C or beta carotene, an antioxidant. Grapefruit juice, orange juice, and papaya nectar are rich in vitamin C. Apricot nectar and carrot juice have lots of beta carotene.Show sources Hide sources Kanadys WM. 2007.

Legumes in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_legumes-in-your-pregnancy-diet_10325923.bc,"Why legumes are so importantLegumes are nutritional powerhouses. Which foods are legumes? From a botanical perspective, legumes are plants with a seedpod that splits in half. This includes beans, peas, soybeans, peanuts, and lentils. They're an excellent source offolate,potassium,iron, andmagnesium, and essential fatty acids.Legumes also contain compounds called phytochemicals. Researchers are studying phytochemicals for their ability to prevent heart disease, cancer, and diabetes.Legumes also provide soluble fiber, which has been linked with lower levels of total cholesterol and LDL (""bad"") cholesterol and possibly a reduced risk of colon cancer. Fiber can also help preventconstipation andhemorrhoids common problems during pregnancy.Most legumes are a good source ofprotein, so they fall into the same category as meat when it comes to meal planning. But they contain no cholesterol and are generally low in fat  and they're inexpensive too!Good legume choicesHere are some good options for legumes, along with the grams of protein in each serving. Aim for about six servings (or 3 cups) of legumes in your diet each week.1/4 cup soybeans, dry roasted: 10 g1/2 cup cooked soybeans: 8 g1/2 cup raw regular tofu, prepared with calcium sulfate: 10 g1/4 cup peanuts, dry roasted without salt: 9 g1/2 cup cooked edamame: 9 g1/4 cup (2 ounces) tempeh: 8 g1/2 cup cooked split peas: 8 g1/2 cup cooked lentils: 9 g1/2 cup cooked black beans: 8 g1/2 cup cooked kidney beans: 8 g1 cup plain soy milk: 7 g1/2 cup cooked garbanzo beans (chickpeas): 8 g1/2 cup cooked lima beans: 7 g1/2 cup cooked peas: 4 gAlthough sugar snap peas and snow peas are legumes, they're not high in protein. That's why they're counted as vegetables for food planning purposes.Easy ways to add legumes to your daily dietExperiment with new and different kinds of legumes: Try adzuki beans, anasazi beans, black-eyed peas, edamame, or fava beans, for example.If time is short, choose quick-cooking legumes, like lentils, or buy canned or frozen legumes. (The nutritional content is about the same.)Add legumes to soups, stews, casseroles, and stir fries.Pure beans to make spreads and dips.Add your favorite types of beans to salads.Snack on small amounts of soy nuts, almonds, or peanuts.Try a recipe for tofu loaf instead of meatloaf.Add tempeh to tomato sauce, stir fries, and casseroles.Show sources Hide sources AHA. 2015.

Pregnancy weight gain: What to expect,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pregnancy-weight-gain-what-to-expect_1466.bc,"How much weight should I gain during my pregnancy?It depends on how much you weighed before you conceived and whether that's the appropriate weight for your height. The relationship between your height and weight is expressed in a number called a body mass index, or BMI. You can calculate your BMI here.The guidelines for pregnancy weight gain are determined by the Institute of Medicine (IOM). Here are the most current recommendations, set in 2009:Healthy weight (BMI of 18.5 to 24.9): If your pre-pregnancy weight was in the healthy range for your height when you conceive, you should gain between 25 and 35 pounds. For the optimal growth of your baby, aim to put on 1 to 5 pounds in the first trimester and about 1 pound per week for the rest of your pregnancy.Underweight (BMI below 18.5): If you were underweight for your height, you should gain 28 to 40 pounds.Overweight (BMI of 25 to 29.9): If you were overweight for your height, you should gain 15 to 25 pounds.Obese (a BMI of 30 or higher): If you were obese for your height, you should gain between 11 and 20 pounds.Carrying twins: If you're having twins you should gain:37 to 54 pounds if you are at a healthy weight31 to 50 pounds if you are overweight25 to 42 pounds if you are obeseWeight gain and pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:25Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:25Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosWhat if I gain too much or too little weight during my pregnancy?The babies of women who gain more than the recommended amount of weight during pregnancy may be larger than normal at birth, which can cause labor complications for both you and your baby. For example, studies show that women who gain too much during pregnancy are at higher risk for having a cesarean delivery or a premature birth. They also tend to retain more weight after pregnancy and weigh more during subsequent pregnancies.However, the risks for women who gain too much during pregnancy are less than the risks for women who are overweight when they conceive. Women who start pregnancy overweight are at higher risk for complications, including gestational diabetes and preeclampsia. Women who are obese are also at higher risk of miscarriage, stillbirth, preterm birth, or having a baby with birth defects.SlideshowPregnancy weight gain recommendationsIn addition, women who are overweight or obese before pregnancy tend to have trouble starting and continuing breastfeeding. Experts believe reasons for this may include poor milk production and difficulty positioning the baby for nursing. Gaining too much weight during pregnancy may make this problem worse.But fortunately, many weight-related health conditions and situations can be managed or even avoided with the right lifestyle changes. Talk with your doctor or midwife about ways to lower your risk factors. By exercising, eating well, and staying within your guidelines for weight gain, you can significantly boost your chances of having a perfectly healthy pregnancy and delivery.On the other hand, if you started pregnancy underweight, or if you don't gain enough during pregnancy, you have a higher risk of delivering a preterm infant or a low-birth-weight baby (less than 5.5 pounds). Prematurity can cause lifelong health problems or even be fatal for the baby, especially in very preterm births. Ask your healthcare provider for advice on coming up with a sensible meal plan that includes all the calories and nutrients you and your baby need.How much weight do most pregnant women gain?About a third of women gain within the amount recommended by the IOM, and about half gain more. Most underweight women gain within the guidelines, but some women at a healthy weight exceed the advised amounts. Most overweight or obese women gain too much.The IOM guidelines urge prenatal caregivers to counsel women about diet and exercise more effectively so that expectant mothers have a better chance of staying within the recommended weight limits.How do I deal with anxiety about gaining weight during pregnancy?If you've struggled with your weight in the past, or even if you've never dieted in your life, you may have a hard time accepting that it's okay to gain weight now. It's normal to feel anxious as the numbers on the scale inch up. Just try to keep in mind that gaining weight is important for a healthy pregnancy and that those extra pounds will eventually come off after you've had the baby.If weight gain is getting you down, you're not alone. Find out how other moms-to-be are coping with putting on the pregnancy pounds.How do I lose weight after I give birth?A certain amount of the weight you've been accumulating will disappear shortly after you give birth. Mothers who gained a healthy amount of weight during pregnancy usually lose about half of their pregnancy weight in the first six weeks after delivery. The baby accounts for about 7.5 pounds (more or less), and the amniotic fluid, placenta, extra body fluids, fat stores, and blood in your body add up to another 8 to 12 pounds.For the rest, remember that it took nine months to put on the weight, and it can take just as long (or longer) for it to come off. A healthy diet combined with regular exercise and exclusive breastfeeding is the most effective way to shed the pounds  and keep them off.Don't start cutting back on calories right away, though. Having a newborn requires lots of energy  and that means giving your body all the nutrition it needs. If you're patient, you may be surprised at how much weight you lose naturally, especially if you're breastfeeding.If you do have trouble losing weight, consider seeing a registered dietitian and perhaps a fitness trainer to help you lose the appropriate amount of weight at a healthy rate.Learn more:Eight things nutritionists wish you'd do during pregnancyTen ways to make your pregnancy pounds pay offThe pregnancy body survey: 1,500 women talk weight gain, body changes, and moreLearn all about weight gain during pregnancyShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

Protein in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_protein-in-your-pregnancy-diet_1690.bc,"Why you need protein during pregnancyThe amino acids that make up protein are the building blocks of your body's cells  and of your baby's body as well. It's important to get enough protein throughout your pregnancy, but it's especially critical during the second and third trimesters. That's when your baby is growing the fastest, and your breasts and organs are getting bigger to accommodate the needs of your growing baby.How much protein you needProtein requirements for pregnant women can range from as little as 40 grams to as much as 70 grams per day, depending on how much you weigh. To find out how much protein your body needs each day, you can go to ChooseMyPlate.gov and create an individualized meal plan.You don't have to get the recommended amount of protein every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.11 foods to avoid during pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:23Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:23Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Find out which foods and beverages you should limit or avoid during pregnancy. See all pregnancy videosMost women in the United States regularly eat more protein than they need, so you probably won't have any trouble meeting your body's needs during pregnancy. If you don't eat meat, you can meet your protein requirements through other sources, including dairy, beans, eggs, or soy products.Weight loss, muscle fatigue, frequent infections, and severe fluid retention can be signs that you're not getting enough protein in your diet.Food sources of proteinBeans are a great source of protein, as are lean meat, poultry, fish and shellfish, eggs, milk, cheese, tofu, and yogurt. Although animal products contain complete proteins (all nine amino acid components) and plant sources generally don't, eating a variety of foods throughout the course of the day will help ensure that you get all of the amino acids you need.Eat three or four servings of protein daily, and you'll be well on your way to eating right for a healthy pregnancy and baby. (Seventy grams of protein roughly equals the total of two 8-ounce glasses of milk, a 5-ounce chicken breast, and one 7-ounce container of nonfat Greek yogurt, for example.)Here are some good protein sources:Dairy1/2 cup ricotta cheese: 14 g1/2 cup low-fat cottage cheese: 12 g8 ounces low-fat yogurt: 9 to 12 g1 ounce Parmesan cheese: 11 g1 ounce Swiss cheese: 8 g1 cup low-fat milk: 8 g1 ounce cheddar cheese: 7 g1 ounce mozzarella cheese: 6 gOne large fresh egg: 6 gBeans, nuts, legumes1/2 cup raw tofu (firm): 20 g1 cup cooked lentils: 18 g1 cup canned black beans: 15 g1 cup canned kidney beans: 13 g1 cup canned garbanzos: 12 g1 cup canned pinto beans: 12 g2 tablespoons smooth peanut butter: 8 g1 ounce dry roasted peanuts: 7 g1 cup light plain soymilk: 6 gMeat, poultry and fishNote that 3 ounces of cooked meat or fish is about the size of a pack of cards.1/2 roasted chicken breast (no skin): 27 g3 ounces baked or grilled sockeye salmon: 23 g3 ounces baked or grilled trout: 23 g3 ounces lean beef hamburger patty, broiled: 21gCaution:Not all fish are considered safe during pregnancy.

Real mom tips for saving money,https://www.babycenter.com/0_real-mom-tips-for-saving-money_10409454.bc,"The best budget tips come from your friends  even friends you havent met. We reached into the BabyCenter community and pulled out these tried-and-true tips for everything from saving on food and utilities to putting away cash for college.Build up your savingsI commit $250 per month to savings and only touch it if absolutely necessary. The only way it worked was I considered it a bill and would move the $250 as soon as we got paid, and did the rest of the budget after. It was hard at first, but it's gotten easier. -Cross4AllMany people think you need to have money to even start talking with a financial adviser. You don't. It has helped us navigate finances tremendously, and as we have progressed financially, our adviser helped us find the right ways to put aside money. Now we have money pulled automatically into investments so we don't even count that as money coming in. -Irishgirl911the2ndHave money withdrawn from the paycheck(s) go directly into savings. I have a savings account with no checks or debit card and at a different bank than we use day to day. If we get a raise, I try to put more in that savings. Because I have to physically go to the bank, I rarely touch the savings. -MomOnTheClockTry Dave Ramsey's envelope system.You take your budget and divide it up into envelopes. Once the money in that envelope is totally gone, that's it. No more money is to be spent on that category. So if you budget $100 to eat for two weeks and spend $98 in the first week, you only have $2 in that envelope for the next week. It forces you to stick to the budget.-thepotters4Stop being impulsive. Easier said than done, but plan meals, plan daily expenditures, plan for one day to eat out a month. Stick to it. Direct your comfort to the amount in your savings account, not instant gratification from spending spontaneously. -leeL0uFind out where you are spending and then create a budget. Don't try to make it too tight or you will lose it. That is, give yourself blow money and don't feel bad using it but don't just spend willy-nilly.Also look for any income-improvement opportunities. So often we just focus on cutting spending, but that is only half the picture. If you are a SAHM, can you look after another child or work part-time? Are you being paid market rates if youre working? Have a look around. -polarbearmamaaSaving vs. Spending (Mom Confidential) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:16Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:16Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosFind smart ways to scrimpWhen it comes to home goods, I try to make do or mend. I don't buy holiday decorations, but I really wanted a wreath for my front door. I called a friend who had a hedge of evergreens in her yard and made one for myself and one for her (as a thank-you). leeannhuberLook into your health-insurance company's Rx-by-mail program. They usually have the lower rates than commercial pharmacies. Added bonus, it comes to your door. No trip to pick up your Rx and then spend money because you are out and about, or in a pinch because it's one more thing to do and you spend out of convenience.-sparksmommaI stay off Pinterest. Pinterest tempts me try new recipes and buy organizing gadgets and craft supplies. I save so much when I'm too busy to go in there. -IndigorainWalk, bike, and use public transportation as much as possible. -sparksmommaIf you think you ""need"" something, first look around for something you can use as a substitute, at least temporarily (rags for paper towels, cardboard boxes for laundry baskets). If you find something, great! If not, maybe it's something you can borrow from a neighbor (tool you won't use often?).If you still need to buy, start looking for the cheapest way to do so. Hopefully, a substitute has bought you time to look for used, wait for a sale, watch for coupons, or arrange with a friend to go halfsies. Your creativity may also help you find a cheaper substitute. -myla's_tribeTransportation: We share a car. I take my husband into work on Friday and run all our errands/appointments on that day. It takes a bit of planning, but it works. This cuts car payments, insurance payments, and gas. Also where I live, Sam's Club has the cheapest gas, and that saves a ton, too. -2tmommy12Cut the utilities billCell phones: Shop the cheapest plans with appropriate coverage in your area.-2tmommy12We use drying racks for a lot of our laundry. Keeps the gas bill lower and extends the life of the clothing.-sparksmommaSave canning/baking for cold days. Open the drapes to let in sun during the warm part of the day. Add extra built-ins/cabinets/quilt artwork on exterior walls as an extra insulated layer.Sleep in a smaller room so theres less to heat. Wear a second set of wool socks. Set your thermostat at 50 degrees when traveling, as the air warms up in just minutes when getting home. Add humidity. It makes the rooms feel warmer. -ts07404Save on food shoppingAnalyze your receipt. Look at what you are spending on what. Are there things you can cut like juice, Coke, chips, and snacks? Can you cut back on meats and do a meat-free night once a week? Also, are you using everything you buy? If you are throwing out produce, leftovers, or stale snacks, that's wasted money. So watch what is going into the trash. Make plans for or freeze leftovers and produce that is getting too ripe. TexasSugarI find that planning better helps us save money. Meal planning (and knowing what we have on hand) ensures that we are less tempted to go out to eat. -tootsieroll1978Ask/look at your local grocery store for Manager Specials.Mine offersone shelf in the meat dept., one for bread, etc. When I find buttermilk for $1.50, salmon half-price, or the extra-fancy bread for $1, it makes me happy. Note: you might also ask in each department what time of day they put things on the specials shelf, so you can plan your shopping at that time. JGHRWhen using coupons, only buy types of products you normally would use. If a different brand of toilet paper is cheaper, that's great ... but don't start buying canned chili or Hamburger Helper just because it's on sale if no one in your family will eat it! (It's tempting sometimes when you find a great deal.) JGHRI noticed that the more trips I make to the market, the more I spent. Limit your trips (also save on gas), and you are less likely to buy things you don't need. Keep track of what you buy to see whether you can find alternatives or make them at home cheaper or buy in bulk. -swttea2I allow myself small splurges. For example, even though I know frozen pizza isn't the best nutrition-wise, spending $10 on frozen pizza saves me from spending $35 on pizza delivery. Spending $4 on bagged salad at the grocery store saves me from going to a restaurant and spending $10 on a salad for lunch. WalkingInTheWoodsSave on clothes shoppingI go to the Goodwill, where they sell clothing by the pound. It really is helping us clothe our baby at an affordable price. -DanaNewNovemberI used to have a bit of a clothes-shopping addiction, nothing over-the-top crazy but it was making things difficult for me. Now if I feel like I need to impulse buy, I set a $5 limit. Then, if I feel like I can't find anything I really like, I don't buy anything. -IheartWes&GI love to save money by shopping at thrift stores, consignments shops, garage sales, and online auctions. I love sifting through things for great deals on brand-new or almost-brand-new items. I also love to refashion things. Thats fun for me too. My new project is to take a few men's plaid shirts from Goodwill and fit them to me so that I can do the whole plaid-and-leggings thing with boots that I scored for $3 on an auction.-shoestringmammaSocking away for collegeWe have a 529 for our little one. When he was baptized, and almost any other time he receives money, we put it in there. We also put some money in for holidays  if, say, at Christmas we planned to spend $100 on him, half goes toward gifts and the other half goes into the college fund until he's older and actually knows the difference between three gifts and ten. -Kel DCGrandparents have access to our childs savings-account number IF they want to put money in. I also have a small amount going out of my pay each pay period. That way I don't miss the money and it will accrue interest over time. -2catsnabumpOnce our mortgage is paid off and we are debt-free, we will bump up our retirement savings and start to think about college funds. Our financial planner said it best: ""Your kids can always borrow for college, but you can't borrow for retirement!"" -lablizWe haven't started saving yet, but currently pay over $18,000 per year for daycare. When our little one starts school at 5 years old, we will take the money we were using towards daycare to save for his tuition. -Kcopeland08We save whatever we get back in taxes for our sons college every year and put in extra when we can.NiaWeaverDont forget to have funWhat made a huge difference in our world was when we decided dinner out needs to be intentional. Also, we have two or three ""emergency"" meals on hand that can be thrown together quick or tossed in the oven/microwave. We keep these on hand for busy nights where we'd be tempted to just go out or hit the drive-through. I also keep a lunch bag in the cars with assorted snacks and bottles of water. This saves us from hitting the snack bar or convenience store.Make going out an event, and save it for a good reason. -sakuraphoenixCable: Cut it. We kept internet and use Netflix and Hulu instead. In a year of doing this, I honestly don't miss cable because we never watched it anyway. Alsoif you get an antenna, you can pick up your local channels: ABC, CBS, NBC, and FOX. We do this quite successfully. Your antenna will depend on your area and whether its metro or rural. -2tmommy12"
"A healthy pregnancy diet, Latino style",https://www.babycenter.com/0_a-healthy-pregnancy-diet-latino-style_10302510.bc,"Eat well  but how?You probably already know how important it is to have a healthy diet during pregnancy. Eating well is essential for both you and your baby because your baby gets nourishment from what you eat.But what is a healthy diet? How many fruits and vegetables should you eat every day  and what kind? Can you eat any sweets or fats?We suggest an approach that will help you make healthy food choices during pregnancy (and beyond) and enable you to monitor what you eat easily and efficiently. This method is based on the diets followed by people with diabetes, to keep their condition in check, but it's useful for anybody who wants to eat nutritiously.Certain ethnic groups that have a high risk of diabetes, including Hispanics, are more likely to develop gestational diabetes. But by following the guidelines below and getting regular exercise (check with your doctor first), you can keep your weight gain in check and help prevent this condition.You'll also want to take a look at our extensive list of foods from a typical Latino diet. The list includes portion sizes to help you make these delicious foods part of your healthy diet during pregnancy. CaloriesIn the Latino culture, there's a widespread belief that when you're pregnant, tienes que comer por dos: You have to eat for two.But healthy eating during pregnancy doesn't mean eating many more calories. Instead, it means eating ""a little of everything""  that is, eating reasonable portions from all the food groups.How many more calories do you need during pregnancy? The number averages around 300 additional calories a day, but it will vary based on how far along you are in your pregnancy. Your body needs extra calories depending on how fast your baby is growing  and this changes as time goes by. Your activity level also affects how many calories you'll need.Your total calorie intake should depend on how much you weigh, how old you are, your weight gain goal, and how active you are. For example, a woman who is 5 feet 4 inches tall and weighs 126 pounds before pregnancy and who does less than 30 minutes of moderate exercise a day needs 2,000 calories per day in her first trimester, 2,200 calories per day in her second trimester, and 2,400 calories per day in her third trimester.Discuss your weight gain goal and calorie needs with your healthcare practitioner or a registered dietitian. You can also go to mypyramid.gov to find an interactive food-pyramid plan for pregnancy. Your calories should come from a variety of foods from the following food groups. The food groupsFoods are divided into three broad categories, according to how the body uses them: carbohydrates (sometimes referred to as starches), protein, and fat.Many foods belong to more than one of these food groups. For example, an avocado supplies carbohydrates, but most of its calories come from fat. And beans, which are considered complex carbohydrates, are also a good source of protein.Carbohydrates (Starch)Your body breaks down carbohydrates into glucose to get the energy it needs to move and perform daily activities. Fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes (beans) all belong to this group. Milk also contains carbohydrates.There are two kinds of carbohydrates: simple and complex.Simple carbohydrates enter your bloodstream relatively quickly because they're refined, so your body doesn't need to work as hard to break them down.White flour and sugar (both natural, like that found in fruit, and refined) and all the food made from them  such as white bread, flour tortillas, pasta, cola, fruit juice, sweetened beverages, and sweets  belong in the category of simple carbohydrates.If you have high blood sugar, be wary of simple carbohydrates, since they can quickly raise your glucose level. Pregnant women are particularly sensitive to eating simple carbs in the morning, so you may want to put off eating these foods until late morning or afternoon.Complex carbohydrates are also converted into glucose, but because they aren't refined, it takes longer for your body to break them down, so your blood sugar level doesn't rise as fast.Vegetables, legumes, and whole grains are all considered complex carbohydrates. Vegetables like corn, pumpkin, and potatoes are ""starchy vegetables."" They contain more carbohydrates than other vegetables, which means the body gets more energy from them.Nonstarchy vegetables, like green beans, carrots, lettuce, broccoli, tomatoes, and summer squash, contain fewer carbohydrates  and create less glucose  than potatoes or bread. These unrefined foods contain plenty of vitamins, minerals, and fiber, so they're very good for you during pregnancy.ProteinProtein is necessary for creating new tissue and repairing existing tissue. It's important to eat plenty of protein during pregnancy, to promote the healthy growth of your baby. Protein is found in meat, fish, poultry, eggs, beans, nuts, soy, and dairy products.FatYour baby needs fat for development, and you need it to stay healthy. But some fats are considered better for you than others.For example, vegetable fat (such as olive oil) and the fat in fish (like salmon) is better for your health than the saturated fat found in other animal products and the trans fat found in some baked goods and fried foods. It's a good idea to eat fat in moderation, because it's high in calories and could lead to unnecessary weight gain. ServingsFood is measured in servings, so you can easily know how much to eat. How much food makes up a serving depends on the type of food.For example, 1/2 cup of black beans (which are legumes) is one serving of protein and one serving of carbohydrates (starch). And 6 ounces of plain yogurt is one serving of carbohydrates (milk/yogurt).The following are equal to one serving:CarbohydratesStarches: 1/2 cup lentils, refried beans, or other legumes; 1/3 cup pasta or rice; 3/4 cup flake cereal; 1/2 cup hot cereal; 1/2 cup starchy vegetables like corn or potatoes; 1 piece of bread; 1 6-inch corn or flour tortilla; 6 saltine crackers; 3 cups popcornFruit: 1/2 cup or 1 small piece fresh fruitMilk and yogurt: 1 cup unsweetened milk or soy milk; 6 ounces plain or sugar-free yogurtVegetables: 1 1/2 cups raw or cooked vegetables; 2 cups leafy greensProtein1 ounce meat or fish; 1/2 cup legumes; 1 ounce cheese; 1 ounce nuts or seeds; 1 tablespoon nut butter; 1 egg or 2 egg whitesFat1 teaspoon oil, butter, or mayonnaiseThese serving sizes are based on ""diabetes exchange lists,"" the basis of a meal planning system from the American Diabetes Association and American Dietetic Association, and are slightly different from serving sizes listed on mypyramid.gov.Here are some healthy choices during pregnancy:Starches: Legumes/beans; whole grain breads, pastas, and cereals; brown rice; corn or whole grain tortillas or wraps; whole-grain crackers, sweet potatoes, winter squashVegetables: All types, preferably green leafy vegetables and yellow, red, or orange vegetables. Tomatoes and chiles  Latino favorites  are especially rich in nutrients!Fruits: All kinds, especially those that are high in vitamin C, such as strawberries, guava, papaya, oranges, mango, kiwi, and grapefruitMilk and yogurt: Low-fat or skim milk, and milk-based products such as plain or sugar-free yogurtMeat and meat substitutes: Lean beef, pork, and lamb; shellfish and fish (especially those from cold water, which are high in omega-3 fatty acids); eggs; legumes; nuts; seeds; nut and seed butters; low-fat cheeseFats: Olive and canola oil; trans-fat-free margarine, butter, and mayonnaise; avocado; olives; salad dressing; nuts and seeds (in small quantities) Your pregnancy dietYou have a wide range of foods to choose from to create your pregnancy menus, including many ingredients used in a typical Latino diet.Here's a breakdown of how much your daily diet should include of each type of food, based on a meal plan of 2,200 calories  what an average-size woman would need during the second trimester.The sample menu is just one example of how to distribute the portions throughout the day, in three large meals and two snacks. You can distribute them differently to suit your needs.Starches: 9 servings dailyOne serving equals 1/2 cup beans, corn, or potato; 1 slice of whole wheat bread; 1 corn or small flour tortilla; 1/3 cup pasta or rice; 1/2 cup hot cereal; 3/4 cup flake cereal; 5 whole wheat crackers.Vegetables: 3 servings dailyOne serving equals 1 cup of cooked or raw veggies or 2 cups of raw leafy greens.Aim to eat a variety of vegetables, especially those that are dark or brightly colored, such as dark green (broccoli and spinach), orange (carrots), and red (tomatoes, chiles, beets, red cabbage). Remember that starchy vegetables are also very healthy to eat regularly, but they're ""counted"" as starches.Fruit: 4 servings dailyServings vary, depending on a fruit's natural sugar content: One serving equals 1 small apple, pear, or nectarine; 1/2 grapefruit; 1/2 small mango; 1 cup papaya; 1 1/4 cup strawberries or watermelon.Milk and yogurt: 3 servings dailyOne serving equals 8 ounces skim or low-fat unsweetened milk or soy milk, or one 6 ounce container of plain or sugar-free yogurt. (While cheese is also a calcium-rich food, it's counted as a protein food.)Protein: 7 ounces total dailyAim to eat mostly lean protein and protein from plant-based sources. A 1-ounce piece of fish, chicken, pork, beef, or cheese equals 1 egg or 2 egg whites; 1/4 cup low-fat cottage or ricotta cheese; 1/2 cup tofu; 1 tablespoon peanut butter; 1/2 cup lentils or pinto, black, or navy beans; 1/3 cup hummus.Note that legumes also count as a starch, and that some protein sources may be high in fat.Fat: 6 teaspoons total daily1 teaspoon oil equals 1 teaspoon margarine or butter, 2 tablespoons avocado, 1 tablespoon low-fat margarine spread or low-fat mayonnaise, 1 tablespoon regular salad dressing, 2 tablespoons reduced-fat salad dressing, 1 tablespoon pumpkin or sunflower seeds, 10 peanuts, or 8 large black olives. Sample daily menuBreakfast: 2 eggs cooked with onion, tomato, and chile; 1 piece of whole grain bread or small whole grain tortilla with 1 teaspoon of margarine or butterMid-morning snack: 3 graham crackersLunch: Caldo de pollo (chicken soup) made with 1 chicken leg and 1 1/2 cups of vegetables (like cabbage, carrots, and celery), plus 1/2 ear of corn and 1/2 cup potato; 1 corn tortilla; 1/4 cup guacamole; yogurt parfait made by combining 6 ounces sugar-free yogurt and 1 sliced peachMid-afternoon snack: 3 cups light popcorn and a smoothie made from 8 ounces skim or low-fat milk and 1/2 frozen mangoDinner: 3 ounces broiled salmon, 1 cup spinach salad with 1 tablespoon salad dressing, 1/2 cup pinto beans, 1 cup steamed veggies with 1 teaspoon of margarine or butter, 1 corn tortilla, and 1 small appleBedtime snack: 1/2 cup bran flakes; 1 extra small or 1/2 medium banana, 1 cup skim or low-fat milkAlthough this may seem a little complicated at first, it's really quite simple and you may end up doing it almost automatically. You'll feel great eating this way. You may even decide to continue your healthy diet after you deliver your baby!What about sweets?Sweets are refined carbohydrates that are packed with calories and few, if any, vitamins or minerals. They may taste delicious, but it's important to eat them sparingly and with a meal because they can quickly raise blood sugar levels.If you crave something sweet, try to find a healthier option. For example, a handful of frozen grapes can leave you feeling as satisfied as ice cream, with significantly fewer calories.Adapted from Waiting for Beb: A Pregnancy Guide for Latinas, by Lourdes Alcaiz"
Your pregnancy diet: The basics of eating well,https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-eating-well,"Fine-tune your diet  even if you already eat wellAlmost all pregnant women need to get more protein, more of certain vitamins and minerals (such as folic acid and iron), and more calories (for energy). If there's room for improvement in your diet, eating highly nutritious meals is one of the best things you can do for your baby's health.But eating better doesn't mean eating a lot. If you start off at a healthy weight, you don't need additional calories during the first trimester. In the second trimester, you need about 340 extra calories a day and about 450 extra calories a day in the third trimester. If you're underweight or overweight to start, you'll need more or less than this, depending on your weight gain goal.Learn more: Find out the best ways to eat for two and get the calories you need.Skip unsafe foodsSome foods can be dangerous when you're pregnant. Steer clear of these foods:Raw seafood (such as oysters or uncooked sushi)Unpasteurized milk (and cheese made from unpasteurized milk)Soft cheese (such as Brie or Camembert)Mexican cheese (like queso blanco and panela)PtRaw or undercooked meat and poultryAll of these are possible sources of bacteria that can be harmful to an unborn child.Learn more: Find out how to avoid listeriosis, a foodborne illness that's especially dangerous during pregnancy. Pregnancy weight gain trackerSee your target weight range for pregnancy and whether your weight gain is on track.Say no to alcoholYou'll need to give up cocktails, too. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause physical defects, learning disabilities, and emotional problems in children, so many experts recommend that you give up alcohol for your entire pregnancy.Learn more: Discover your favorite nonalcoholic alternative from our list of the best virgin drinks.Limit caffeineCaffeine is another consideration. Aim to get less than 200 milligrams (mg) per day (about 12 ounces of coffee). Some studies suggest a link between higher amounts of caffeine and miscarriage or lower birth weight, but this hasn't been confirmed. Just in case, stick to decaffeinated tea and sodas, or choose healthier drinks, such as skim milk, 100 percent fruit juice, or water with a squeeze of lemon.Learn more: Be informed about caffeine during pregnancy and see how much caffeine there is in common beverages and foods.Go easy on fishNearly all fish contain traces of methylmercury, a metal believed to be harmful in high doses to the growing brains of fetuses and young children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends limiting your consumption of fish to 12 ounces a week, which is the equivalent of about two servings.Learn more: Get the facts about eating fish during pregnancy and find answers to all your food safety questions.Take a prenatal vitaminEven without morning sickness or food aversions, it's difficult to meet your nutritional needs with just a well-balanced diet. A prenatal vitamin-mineral supplement helps you get the nutrients you and your baby need to thrive.Make sure the prenatal vitamin you choose contains folic acid. (You need 400 mcg daily before you become pregnant and in early pregnancy. Some groups, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health, suggest boosting your intake to at least 600 mcg once you're pregnant.) Not getting enough folic acid has been linked to neural tube birth defects (NTDs), such as spina bifida. Ask your healthcare provider if you need to take other supplementsCholine is another important nutrient that researchers now believe may help prevent NTDs. You need 450 mg of choline a day during pregnancy. Most prenatal vitamins don't contain it, so you'll have to get it from food or ask your healthcare provider about taking a choline supplement.Later in your pregnancy your provider may suggest that you take iron or calcium supplements to make sure you're getting enough of these key minerals. Some experts also recommend taking a vitamin D supplement throughout pregnancy.If you're a strict vegetarian, have a medical condition such as diabetes, gestational diabetes, or anemia, or have previously delivered a low-birth-weight baby, talk with your healthcare provider about other supplements you might need. A registered dietitian can also help with diet specifics.If you have trouble swallowing your vitamins or keeping them down, search for a chewable supplement or one in a powdered form that you can mix with water. And keep in mind that more isn't always better: Don't take megadoses of any vitamin, mineral, or herbal supplement without medical supervision  they could harm your developing baby.Learn more: See our chart of nutrients you need to help your baby grow.Don't diet while you're pregnantDieting during pregnancy could be harmful to you and your baby. Many eating plans designed for weight loss would leave you low not only on calories, but also on iron, folic acid, and other important vitamins and minerals.Weight gain is one of the most positive signs of a healthy pregnancy. Women who eat well and gain the& appropriate amount of weight are more likely to have healthy babies. If you're eating wholesome foods and slowly adding pounds, you can rest assured things are most likely on track.Keep in mind that when you put on your pregnancy weight may be as important as how much you gain. Healthcare providers recommend that you gain the least weight during the first trimester  roughly 1 to 5 pounds  and then gain roughly a pound a week in the second and third trimesters. (Talk with your provider if you're carrying twins or if you're underweight or overweight at the start of pregnancy  your recommended rate of weight gain might be different.)Learn more: Find out what eating for two really means. Eat small meals frequentlyIt's fine to get creative with your eating schedule during pregnancy. If nausea, food aversions, heartburn, or indigestion make eating full-size meals uncomfortable, try eating small, frequent meals throughout the day. As your pregnancy progresses and your baby increasingly crowds your stomach and other digestive organs, you'll have less space in your body for big meals anyway.If you're most hungry when it's not typically time to eat, go ahead and have your meal when the feeling strikes. Eating in a pattern that works for you will help you meet your nutritional needs during pregnancy.(Snacks in between meals are fine, but make healthy choices as often as you can  junk food offers little more than empty calories.)Learn more: Create a pregnancy meal plan you can live with.Treat yourself to something sweet on occasionAvoid making processed foods, packaged snacks, and sugary desserts the mainstay of your diet, but you don't have to give up all your favorite goodies just because you're pregnant. Try smart and tasty alternatives such as a banana smoothie, frozen all-fruit nonfat sorbet, or trail mix.And don't beat yourself up if you cave in to temptation now and again. The occasional cookie or piece of cake won't do any harm.11 foods to avoid during pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:23Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:23Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

How to get your preschooler to eat more healthy food,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-get-your-preschooler-to-eat-more-healthy-food_64318.bc,"Eating well gives your preschooler the energy he needs to learn and grow. And it'll help him stay healthy, maintain a healthy weight, and establish good lifelong eating habits. Here are some ways to make nutritious food the most appealing choice:Get your preschooler involvedA great way to get your preschooler excited about eating a range of healthy foods is to involve him in the family's meal-planning decisions. Let him help you make out menus and a grocery list. Have him check to see whether you're out of grapes and suggest favorite suppers or breakfasts.When you take him food shopping, ask him to hold the grocery list for you as you shop. Give him a few choices to make along the way: Peaches or mangoes? Peas or carrots? Graham crackers or fig bars?Show your child how you check for specific ingredients on the nutrition labels of the foods you choose  and those you put back on the shelf.Make a habit of selecting one new fruit or vegetable to try each week, keeping in mind that your child may not be interested in trying something unfamiliar until it's been offered numerous times.To encourage your child to take some responsibility for his own nutrition, you could help him create his own daily food chart, with boxes for each category: fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy, and meat/protein. (Check out the United States Department of Agriculture's ready-made chart to get started.)Show your child how to color in or check off the appropriate boxes when he finishes a meal or snack. Then look at the chart together at the end of each day to tally how well he did in meeting his nutritional goals.Encourage his involvement in the kitchenInvite your preschooler to help you in the kitchen. Enlist his help putting toppings on the pizza or vegetables on kabobs. Show him how to wash lettuce and toss a salad. Once he can handle it, help him measure ingredients  an excellent foundation for learning fractions! Make meals and snacks funArrange carrot sticks, cherry tomatoes, and bell peppers to look like a face on your preschooler's plate. Make pancakes in the shape of his initials and cut toast into a heart shape. Offer yogurt or low-fat salad dressing for him to dip pretzels, vegetables, or fruit slices in, and outfit him with a lively placemat and dinnerware. Go to the sourceTake your preschooler on an outing to an orchard, berry farm, or dairy so he can see where the food on his plate comes from. The novelty just might inspire him to try something he wouldn't otherwise be interested in.There's nothing like seeing your own food grow to motivate kids to eat their fruits and veggies. Think about planting your own. Even if you don't have much space, you can grow tomatoes or strawberries in a container on a balcony or patio. A study published in 2007 in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association shows that preschoolers in rural areas are more likely to eat more fruits and veggies if they're grown at home.Be picky about juicesFruit juices count toward your preschooler's daily fruit intake, but be careful about the kind and amount of juice you offer. Serve your preschooler only 100 percent fruit juice or fruit-vegetable juice combinations. (These are full of nutrients and contain less natural sugar than many fruit juices.) Some kids even enjoy vegetable juices straight up!If your preschooler won't drink milk, you may want to find juices that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D, but don't offer fruit ""drinks"" because they may contain as little as 10 percent juice and an array of flavorings and sweeteners.Keep in mind that even the healthiest fruit juices can easily become too much of a good thing. Juice can contribute to childhood obesity and malnourishment because a child who drinks a great deal of juice gets extra calories and, at the same time, not all the nutrients he needs. It can also lead to tooth decay, especially if your child carries around a sippy cup all day long.So limit your child to 4 to 6 ounces of fruit juice per day, and use fresh fruit to meet the rest of his requirement. When he's thirsty, offer him water. (You can also water down your child's juice, half and half, for the flavor of juice with fewer extra calories.)Shake and bakeSmoothies are an easy way to get fruit and other nutritious foods into your child's diet. All you need is a blender and a few simple ingredients. You can use your choice of fresh fruit, frozen fruit such as berries or bananas (peel before freezing), or even canned pineapple or peaches (strain the syrup first).You might want to include tofu or hard-cooked egg whites  they add protein without changing the taste or texture  and a bit of ground flax seed for extra fiber and omega 3s. Blend with fruit juice or add milk, yogurt, or frozen yogurt for a creamier drink and a dose of calcium.Whole wheat and bran muffins and quick breads are a good source of grains and fiber, and they can also be a vehicle for fruits and vegetables. Make or buy them with bananas, blueberries, carrots, pineapple, or zucchini. Fortify but don't foolYou might try incorporating healthy foods into dishes you know your preschooler likes, but don't be sneaky about it. (Even if he falls for it now, he may later feel betrayed when he figures out what's up.)Tell him that you're giving him some special pasta spirals tonight  with spinach mixed in or with broccoli and cheese on top. Better to be up-front and encourage an adventurous approach to eating.Make it countBe aware of your child's nutritional needs, but don't worry about them. It's not hard to meet a preschooler's daily requirements. Here are some easy ways to serve up good nutrition:One tablespoon of peanut butter on one slice of whole wheat bread and an 8-ounce glass of low-fat milk provides plenty of nutrition. Before the age of 4, this menu will fulfill all of your preschooler's protein requirement, one third of his grain recommendation, 50 percent of his daily dairy, 65 percent of his need for zinc, 32 percent of vitamin E, 18 percent of iron, and 65 percent of his calcium needs. For a 4-year-old, it will fulfill 77 percent of his protein needs, 20 percent of his grain recommendation, 50 percent of his dairy, 39 percent of zinc, 28 percent of vitamin E, 13 percent of iron, and 41 percent of his calcium needs.A bowl of bran cereal with raisins (three-quarters cup cereal with three-quarters cup low-fat milk) and half a cup of orange juice will provide an excellent start to a preschooler's day. Before age 4, this menu will fulfill half of your preschooler's fruit recommendation and almost half of his dairy needs, a third of his grain recommendation, 81 percent of protein, 51 percent of iron, 63 percent of zinc, and over 100 percent of his daily need for vitamin C. Once he's 4 years old, it will fulfill a third of his fruit and almost half his dairy requirements, 20 percent of his grain, 56 percent of his protein, 36 percent of his iron, 38 percent of zinc, and over 100 percent of his daily vitamin C needs.If your preschooler is younger than 4, one slice of cheese pizza will provide 89 percent of his protein, 28 percent of his calcium, 35 percent of his iron, and 22 percent of his vitamin A needs for the day. Once he's 4 years old, a slice of cheese pizza will fulfill 61 percent of his protein needs, 18 percent of his calcium, 24 percent of his iron, and 16 percent of his daily need for vitamin A. Find fast-food alternativesMost fast food is full of fat, sugar, salt, and excess calories. An occasional fast-food burger and fries won't cause any harm, but if you have an alternative, take it. Teach your child to select from the healthy options on the menu  yes to the grilled chicken sandwich, no to the fried onion rings, and forget about super-sizing the meal!Or pick and choose: Have the burger but choose apple slices or carrot sticks instead of fries. Do your best to limit these kinds of meals to no more than once a week.Be a good role modelAs you consider all the ways of getting your preschooler to eat well, remember to practice what you preach. If your child sees you eating lots of junk food or skipping meals, you can't expect him to eat properly. Make an effort to eat whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and you and your child will both be better off.Be upbeatForget the food fights. Let your child decide how much he wants to eat. And don't use a sweet treat as a bribe or withhold it as a punishment.Try to make mealtime together  at the table, not in front of the television  as enjoyable as possible, so that your child can establish a good, healthy relationship with food."

Gestational diabetes,https://www.babycenter.com/0_gestational-diabetes_2058.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWhat is gestational diabetes?Gestational diabetes is first diagnosed during pregnancy. Like type 1 and type 2 diabetes, gestational diabetes causes blood sugar levels to become too high.When you eat, your digestive system breaks down most of the food into a sugar called glucose. Glucose enters your bloodstream so your cells can use it as fuel. With the help of insulin (a hormone made by your pancreas), muscle, fat, and other cells absorb glucose from your blood.But if your body doesn't produce enough insulin, or if the cells have a problem responding to it, too much glucose remains in your blood instead of moving into cells and getting converted to energy.When you're pregnant, your body naturally becomes more resistant to insulin so that more glucose is available to nourish your baby. For most moms-to-be, this isn't a problem: When your body needs additional insulin to process excess glucose in blood, the pancreas secretes more.But if the pancreas can't keep up with the increased demand for insulin during pregnancy, blood sugar levels rise too high because the cells aren't using the glucose. This results in gestational diabetes.Gestational diabetes needs to be recognized and treated quickly because it can cause health problems for mother and baby.Unlike other types of diabetes, gestational diabetes isn't permanent. Once a baby is born, blood sugar will most likely return to normal quickly. However, having gestational diabetes does make developing diabetes in the future more likely.Weight gain and pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:25Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:25Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosAm I at risk of developing gestational diabetes?Anyone can develop gestational diabetes, and not all women who develop the condition have known risk factors. About 5 to 10 percent of all pregnant women get gestational diabetes. You're more likely to develop gestational diabetes if you:are age 25 or olderhave a close relative who has diabetesare overweight, especially if your body mass index (BMI) is 30 or higherhave polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS)have a medical condition that makes diabetes more likely, such as glucose intolerancetake certain medications like glucocorticoids (for asthma or an autoimmune disease), beta-blockers (for high blood pressure or a rapid heart rate), or antipsychotic drugs (for mental health problems)have had gestational diabetes beforehave had a big baby before (macrosomia)are African American, Native American, Asian American, Hispanic, or Pacific IslanderUnfortunately, there's no way to guarantee that you won't get gestational diabetes. But there are ways to lower your risk. Adopting a healthy lifestyle  eating a balanced diet and getting regular exercise  can make it less likely that you'll develop the condition.Pregnancy weight gain trackerSee your target weight range for pregnancy and whether your weight gain is on track. What are the symptoms of gestational diabetes?Most women who are diagnosed with gestational diabetes don't have any symptoms. That's why your healthcare provider will offer you a screening test for gestational diabetes when you're between 24 and 28 weeks pregnant.If you have any risk factors for gestational diabetes, your provider may suggest doing the test earlier. Most women who have gestational diabetes find out that they have it after taking this test.The most common test for gestational diabetes is the oral glucose screening test. This test measures how efficiently your body produces insulin. On the day of the test, your provider will give you a sweet liquid to drink. An hour later, you'll have a blood test to check your glucose levels.If your test shows that your blood sugar is too high, you'll have to take a longer test called the oral glucose tolerance test. For this test, you'll need to fast before being given a sweet liquid to drink. Your blood will be tested at fasting, then again after one, two, and three hours. If the result of two tests shows your blood sugar is too high, you'll be diagnosed with gestational diabetes.Both of these tests are safe for you and your baby and don't have any major side effects. But drinking the liquid may taste unpleasant and make you feel nauseated afterward.What's the treatment for gestational diabetes?Many women can manage their gestational diabetes by following an exercise plan and eating a balanced, healthy diet based on whole grains, lean proteins, vegetables, and other foods that release sugar slowly. However, about 15 percent of women with gestational diabetes need to take medication to balance their blood sugar (anti-hyperglycemic medication).Insulin injections are the most common medical treatment for gestational diabetes. If you need insulin, you'll have up to three injections daily, and your provider will teach you to inject yourself.Monitoring your own blood sugar is a vital part of your treatment plan. Your provider will show you how to test yourself with a special device. This involves pricking your finger with a small needle first thing in the morning and then again an hour or two after you've eaten a meal. Many women find this uncomfortable procedure to be the worst part of the treatment for gestational diabetes.How does gestational diabetes affect pregnancy?Most women with gestational diabetes who can keep their glucose levels in check go on to have a successful pregnancy and a healthy baby. But having gestational diabetes makes you and your baby more likely to develop certain complications.If you have gestational diabetes, you're more likely to go into labor early (preterm labor). Babies who are born early are more likely to have health problems and may also need extra care after birth. You may also have a higher risk of high blood pressure or preeclampsia. These conditions make preterm labor more likely and can cause health problems for you and your baby.Babies of women with gestational diabetes are more likely to be bigger than average (macrosomia). Large babies can get stuck in the birth canal while being born (shoulder dystocia), which can injure nerves in the neck and shoulder (brachial plexus injury). Large babies are more likely to be delivered by c-section.Your baby may also have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) after birth and trouble breathing (respiratory distress).How can I have a healthy pregnancy with gestational diabetes?The most important thing you can do to ensure a healthy pregnancy is follow the treatment plan recommended by your provider. This includes sticking to your meal plan, monitoring your blood sugar, exercising regularly, and going to all your prenatal appointments.Although a diagnosis of gestational diabetes may make you feel upset and anxious, with the right treatment and careful management, it's possible to have an uncomplicated pregnancy and healthy baby.It's natural to find a diagnosis of gestational diabetes difficult to cope with at first. You may feel deprived when you can't treat yourself to foods you love. You may also find it hard to motivate yourself to exercise, especially if you're feeling tired and sluggish.You're not alone in struggling with these changes. But by changing your lifestyle and the foods you eat, you're giving your baby the best chance to have a healthy start in life.Even if you do find it hard to stick to your treatment plan, it's important to try your best. Your provider can offer advice and extra support if you're having a hard time. When should I call the doctor if I have gestational diabetes?If you have gestational diabetes, you'll probably see your healthcare provider frequently. But if you don't feel well between visits or notice any unusual symptoms, contact your provider right away.These symptoms could indicate that your blood sugar is too high:feeling very thirstypeeing more often than usualfeeling very tiredfeeling nauseoushaving blurred visionYour provider may have you come in for an exam and additional tests to make sure that you and your baby are doing well. If you're having trouble keeping your blood sugar at a healthy level, your provider can refer you to a specialist.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2014.

Hispanic women: Managing a plus-size pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_hispanic-women-managing-a-plus-size-pregnancy_10346393.bc,"Why is weight an important concern for pregnant Hispanic women?The number of American adults who are obese has more than doubled in the past 40 years, and Hispanic women have the second-highest rate of obesity (after African American women).Mexican American women make up the largest portion of Hispanic women in the United States, and about 78 percent of are overweight or obese. By comparison, 61 percent of white women are overweight or obese.Most women  including overweight women  have healthy pregnancies. But heavier women are more likely to have pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes. Understanding the risks will help you do everything you can to enjoy a safe and healthy plus-size pregnancy.What's considered overweight or obese?When you have more body fat than is ideal for your height, you're considered overweight. If you have an especially high amount of body fat, you're considered obese. To find out if you fall under either category, use your pre-pregnancy weight to calculate your body mass index (BMI) and consult the chart below:BMI between 18.5 and 24.9: normalBMI of 25 or greater: overweightBMI of 30 or greater: obeseAlthough BMI is a quick and easy way to measure the relationship between your weight and your height, it isn't a perfect tool. BMI doesn't take into account gender, age, genetics, or fitness, for example.Why is it especially important for Hispanic women to know about obesity?Several studies indicate that overweight Hispanic women are more likely to have pregnancy complications than overweight Caucasians. In part, this is due to genetics and health risk factors, such as a predisposition to diabetes.Studies show that several cultural factors may also contribute to high rates of obesity among Hispanic women in the United States. These include eating an Americanized diet (with lots of high-calorie, high-fat, and starchy foods), not getting enough physical activity, and living in a Hispanic community with a greater acceptance of large body types.Acculturation  the assimilation of culture and habits  has become an important factor in obesity among Hispanics, especially as they adapt to an American diet. Hispanics who recently immigrated to the United States tend to cook as they did in their country of origin  using fresh vegetables and whole grains.But as they spend more time in the United States, many tend to adopt American habits, such as eating fast food and snacking on junk food. Studies have found that the longer Hispanic immigrants live in the United States, the more weight they're likely to gain. What are the risks to me if I'm overweight during pregnancy?Being overweight or obese can lead to pregnancy complications as well as a difficult labor and delivery. In general, the higher the mother's BMI, the higher the risks.Some of the conditions overweight and obese pregnant women should be aware of include:Preeclampsia: Hispanic women are more likely to be affected by preeclampsia than non-Hispanic white women because of their predisposition to diabetes and high obesity rates.Gestational hypertension: Hispanic women have a lower risk of gestational hypertension compared to white and African American women, but all overweight and obese women are at risk of developing this condition, no matter their ethnicity.Gestational diabetes: Nearly 5 percent of pregnant women develop this condition, and the rate is slightly higher among Hispanic women.Preterm birth: Delivering early is a risk associated with obesity and preeclampsia. About 11 percent of Hispanic women deliver before 37 weeks.Longer, more difficult labor: Overweight women may progress through labor more slowly than women at a healthy weight. Obese women may have trouble getting effective pain relief from an epidural or spinal block (usually because the anesthesiologist has difficulty identifying the right spot in the spine to place the needle).Cesarean section: The likelihood of needing a c-section is higher in overweight women due to the increased risk of gestational diabetes and longer labor. About 32 percent of Hispanic women have c-sections, mirroring both the overall rate and the rate among white women.The good news is that most of these complications are manageable or preventable  and you may not experience any of them. You could have a perfectly healthy pregnancy and delivery, even if you're overweight or obese.That said, pregnancy is a good time to change behaviors associated with obesity to improve your long-term health and help give your baby a healthy start in life. And following a healthy diet and incorporating physical activity into your daily routine sets a good example for your child, so try to get in these good habits now. What are the risks to my baby?Babies born to overweight and obese women are at risk for the following complications:Birth defects: Overweight women are more likely to have a baby with birth defects, especially neural tube defects (NTDs) such as spina bifida. Obese women are also more likely to deliver a baby with major birth defects that affect the brain, heart, and digestive system.Read our article on folic acid supplements to learn how they help prevent NTDs and other birth defects. Also, you may want to ask your doctor if you should boost your folic acid intake above the recommended daily amounts of 400 mcg prior to conception and 600 mcg during pregnancy. (Some studies have found that plus-size women may have lower blood folate levels than smaller women.)Macrosomia (large baby): Obese women are more likely to have babies who weigh more than 9 pounds 15 ounces. Large babies and their mothers are more susceptible to injuries during vaginal delivery. Learn more about macrosomia.Childhood obesity: Studies show that being born to an overweight mother raises a child's risk for being overweight later in life. This is mainly because the behaviors associated with being overweight  unhealthy eating and exercise habits  are learned at home.Studies show that 14.8 percent of Hispanic infants younger than 2 are obese  more than any other ethnic group. The rates increase with age: Twenty-three percent of Hispanic children between the ages of 12 and 19 are obese.For more information on the maternal and infant risks associated with obesity, read more about understanding and managing health risks when you're plus-size and pregnant. How can I manage my weight during pregnancy?For a healthy pregnancy, it's important to manage weight gain, take good care of yourself, and work closely with your healthcare provider. Here are some tips:See a healthcare provider before getting pregnant, if possible. If you're overweight, try to meet with a doctor or midwife for a physical and preconception counseling before you get pregnant.Early visits give your healthcare provider a chance to screen you for risks, evaluate any medications you're taking, and discuss your concerns and how you prepare for pregnancy. Your provider will probably suggest that you try to reach a more healthy weight several months before conceiving. After you get pregnant, attend all your prenatal appointments so your provider can monitor you and your baby, and help you manage your weight.Watch your weight, but don't diet during pregnancy. Once you're pregnant, your provider will probably discourage you from going on a diet to lose weight. Restricting your food intake is potentially hazardous to you and your developing baby. Your provider may suggest the same diet of 2,000 calories a day that's recommended to any other woman.Learn more about managing weight gain during a plus-size pregnancy.Eat healthy. Ask your healthcare provider about seeing a nutritionist who can help you eat well during pregnancy, direct you to foods that will satisfy your hunger, and suggest nutrient-packed meals that will help your baby grow.Check out the United States Department of Agriculture's MyPlate website for tools to help you create healthy meal plans customized to your age, height, pre-pregnancy weight, activity level, and the trimester you're in.Exercise. Unless there's a medical reason not to exercise, try to get at least 20 to 30 minutes of moderate exercise on most or all days of the week. Ideally, start exercising before you get pregnant.Be sure to consult your provider before starting any sort of exercise program, and stop exercising and call your doctor immediately if you notice any of these warning signs.How much weight should I gain during pregnancy?It depends on how much you weighed before you conceived.

Diet for a healthy breastfeeding mom,https://www.babycenter.com/0_diet-for-a-healthy-breastfeeding-mom_3565.bc,"Many new moms wonder how breastfeeding will affect their diet. You probably don't need to make any major changes to what you eat or drink when you're nursing, though there are a few important considerations to keep in mind:Eat a well-balanced diet for your healthOne of the wonders of breast milk is that it can meet your baby's nutritional needs even when you're not eating perfectly. (However, if your diet is too low in calories or relies on one food group at the exclusion of others, this could affect the quality and quantity of your milk.)Just because your baby won't be harmed by your occasional dietary lapses doesn't mean that you won't suffer. When you don't get the nutrients you need from your diet, your body draws on its reserves, which can eventually become depleted. Also, you need strength and stamina to meet the physical demands of caring for a new baby.Many breastfeeding moms feel extra hungry, which makes sense: Your body is working around the clock to make breast milk for your baby. Eating small meals with healthy snacks in between  the way you may have done during pregnancy  is a good way to keep your hunger in check and your energy level high.Breastfeeding lessons learned: 5 things I never knew Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 6:21Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -6:21Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

A filmmaker and mother of two shares what she wants new moms to know. See all baby videosDon't count caloriesThere's no single answer to how many calories a nursing mom needs. But in general, most women who are breastfeeding need about 500 calories more than moms who aren't  that's a total of 2,000 to 2,500 calories per day.Instead of counting calories, follow your hunger as a guide to how much you need to eat.The exact amount depends on a number of individual factors, such as your weight, how much exercise you get, how your metabolism works, and how frequently you're breastfeeding.If you're concerned about putting on excess pounds, talk to your healthcare provider about your body mass index and what you can do to maintain a healthy weight. How to use a breast pumpLearn about the different types of breast pumps, the basics of how they work, and the right way to use a breast pump.Aim for slow and steady weight lossSome new moms find the weight just seems to fall off, while others don't lose much. It all depends on your body, your food choices, your activity level, and your metabolism.The best plan: Lose your pregnancy weight gradually. Plan to take up to a year to get back to your pre-pregnancy weight.Don't try to lose weight by dieting until at least two months after your baby is born. A reduced-calorie diet in the first couple of months could sap your energy and diminish your milk supply.If you're overweight or obese, you may be able to start trying to shed pounds earlier but first ask your doctor for advice. And be sure to stay hydrated  sometimes dieters cut back on water when they eat less food.Most women can safely lose 1 pound each week by combining a healthy diet with moderate exercise.A sudden, large drop in your calorie intake can affect your milk supply, so don't go on a crash diet to lose weight quickly. If you're losing more than 1 pound a week after the first six weeks, that's a sign you need to take in more calories. Include a variety of healthy foodsVariety and balance are key to a healthy diet. Eating a mix of carbohydrates protein, and fat at meals keeps you feeling full longer and supplies the nutrients your body needs.Complex carbs like whole grains and cereals and fresh fruits and vegetables not only provide more nutrition than processed starches and sugars, they provide longer-lasting energy. And choosing from all food groups is important so you can get the vitamins you and your baby need over time. So mix it up  try to eat something today that you didn't eat yesterday. Strawberry and asparagus saladThis spinach salad topped with asparagus, strawberries, and pistachios is perfect as a light lunch.Choose good fatsWhen it comes to fat, think mono- and polyunsaturated fats. Sources of these ""healthy fats"" include canola oil, olive oil, and fatty fish (like salmon) as well as avocados, olives, nuts, and seeds.Limit saturated fats and avoid trans fats, both of which are considered unhealthy. Saturated fats show up in high-fat meats, whole milk, tropical oils (such as palm kernel and coconut), butter, and lard. Partially hydrogenated oils contain trans fats. Saturated fats and trans fats are both listed on a product's nutrition label.In addition to being bad for your diet, getting too much of these unhealthy fats can alter the fat composition of your breast milk, which isn't good for your baby's health.While we don't know the long-term effects of unhealthy fats on infant cardiovascular health, we do know that in adults these fats negatively affect heart health by raising LDL (bad cholesterol), lowering HDL (good cholesterol), and increasing signs of inflammation. Unhealthy fats also boost the risk of heart attack and death from heart disease.Breastfeeding Problem SolverFind solutions to a variety of breastfeeding challenges, including nipple pain, low milk supply, and more.Take extra steps to avoid contaminantsIt's a good idea to try to minimize your exposure to contaminants in your food (and your environment) while you're nursing. Pesticides, insecticides, and other chemicals that you ingest can make their way into your breast milk.Although research is ongoing, we know that environmental chemicals could affect your baby's long-term health. Here are some tips for limiting your exposure:Eat a variety of foods. If you eat large quantities of one food that happens to be high in pesticides, your intake of pesticides will be higher than if that food is just one of many that you eat.Know which fruits and vegetables are highest in pesticides, and choose organic options if possible. Always wash fruits and veggies well. Or better yet, peel them. As of 2011 the ""dirty dozen"" that tested highest for pesticides, according to the Environmental Working Group, were apples, celery, strawberries, peaches, spinach, imported nectarines and grapes, sweet bell peppers, potatoes, blueberries, lettuce, and kale and collard greens.The fruits and vegetables that had the lowest amount of pesticide residue were onions, sweet corn, pineapples, avocados, asparagus, sweet peas, mangoes, eggplant, cantaloupe, kiwi, cabbage, watermelon, sweet potatoes, grapefruit, and mushrooms.Choose produce that's in season in your area, and buy local when you can. Produce that travels long distances often have more pesticides.Choose lean meats, and remove the skin and extra fat before cooking. Chemicals are stored in fat.Consider drinking filtered water while breastfeeding. The EPA requires that all tap water meet certain standards, but small amounts of many chemicals are found in tap water. Eat fish  but be pickyWhen you're nursing, it's important to get protein from a variety of sources  including fish. The American Heart Association recommends fish for a heart-healthy diet.Some fish (especially cold water fish) also contain DHA and EPA, omega-3 fats that play an important role in the brain and eye development that continues during your baby's first year. (Your baby gets these omega-3s from your breast milk.)Not only does DHA help your baby, but it helps you too. Research suggests that moms who have lower levels of DHA, as well as lower seafood consumption, are more likely to develop postpartum depression.Eat up to 12 ounces of most types of fish and seafood per week, including salmon, shrimp, canned light tuna, lake trout, tilapia, catfish, crab, pollack, and scallops.If you don't like seafood, try an omega-3 supplement. Just be sure to talk to your healthcare provider first to find out how much to take.Also, be aware that some types of fish contain contaminants that can be harmful to pregnant and nursing women and children. The Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Agriculture advise not eating shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury.Solid white or albacore tuna tends to be higher in mercury than other types of canned tuna. If you eat solid white or albacore tuna, limit your intake to 6 ounces per week.Other experts and advocacy groups are even more cautious, expanding the list of fish to avoid. Read more about eating fish when you're breastfeeding. Pan-fried salmon with baby leaf saladSeared salmon served over a bed of ripe tomatoes and baby leaf salad.Go easy on the alcoholIf you time it right, an occasional drink probably won't harm your breastfeeding baby, but in general you may want to hold off on drinking alcohol while you're breastfeeding. Alcohol does enter your breast milk, and having as little as one drink may affect your milk letdown reflex.Studies show that babies consume less milk in the four hours after you have an alcoholic beverage. And your baby may become drowsy and fall asleep more quickly after you have a drink, but he'll also sleep for a shorter amount of time. (And, of course, heavy drinking makes you unable to safely care for your baby.)If you're going to enjoy an occasional alcoholic beverage, keep in mind that it takes two to three hours for your body to eliminate the alcohol in one serving of beer or wine. Specific time frames depend on your size and how much you drink, but the more you drink the longer it takes your body to get rid of it. So you might want to time that toast for right after a feeding session.Alcohol isn't stored in breast milk  instead, the level increases and decreases just as it does in your bloodstream. If you have an alcoholic drink, wait at least two hours before breastfeeding your baby or you may need to ""pump and dump."" If you plan to have a drink with alcohol, either breastfeed your baby or express your milk first and store it for later.If you're a breastfeeding mom who supplements late-night feedings with formula, another option is to wait until your baby goes down for the night before you drink alcohol.Also, drink water with your alcoholic drink, and eat before (or while) you drink to help lower the amount of alcohol in your blood and your milk. Drink plenty of water and limit caffeineWhen you're breastfeeding, your body needs plenty of fluid, but there's no need to keep a record of how much you drink. A good guideline to follow is drink to satisfy thirst  that is, drink whenever you feel the need. If your urine is clear or light yellow, it's a good sign that you're well hydrated.Speaking of fluids, it's okay to have your morning cup of coffee while breastfeeding if you like, but don't overdo it. A small amount of caffeine winds up in your breast milk, and it can accumulate in your baby's system because she can't easily break it down and excrete it.Most experts suggest that nursing moms limit their consumption of caffeine (including coffee, tea, soft drinks, energy drinks, chocolate, and coffee ice cream) to no more than 300 mg per day. That's about as much as you'd get in three 5-ounce cups of coffee. You may want to drink even less if you're nursing a newborn or preterm baby. Check out our caffeine chart to see how much caffeine is in popular beverages and foods.Consider the flavors of what you eat and drinkMost nursing moms can eat a wide variety of foods while nursing  including spicy foods  without any objection from their baby. In fact, some experts believe that babies enjoy a variety of flavors in their breast milk. Eating your favorite foods while you're nursing gives your baby a ""taste"" of your diet and may help him accept different foods once he starts eating solids.But some moms swear that certain foods  like broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts, dairy products, chocolate, citrus, garlic, or chili pepper  make their breastfed baby gassy or irritable. If your baby seems consistently uncomfortable after you eat a particular food, then by all means avoid it to see if your baby is happier.In rare instances, your baby may be allergic to something you've eaten. If this is the case, you may notice a reaction on his skin (rash or hives), in his breathing (wheezing or congestion), or in his stools (green or mucousy). Keep taking your vitaminsIt's a good idea to continue taking your prenatal vitamin while you're breastfeeding  at least for the first month or so. After that, you can switch to a regular multivitamin and mineral supplement or stay on your prenatal vitamin, depending on your individual needs. (You can discuss this with your healthcare provider at your first postpartum visit.)A supplement doesn't take the place of a well-balanced diet, but it can provide some extra insurance on those days when taking care of your new baby keeps you from eating as well as you'd like.In addition to your prenatal vitamin or multivitamin, consider taking the following supplements:Calcium: While your prenatal vitamin or multivitamin may have small amounts of calcium, but you'll need supplemental calcium if you're not eating at least three daily servings of calcium-rich foods (like milk and other dairy products, canned fish, or calcium-fortified foods like cereals, juices, soy and rice beverages, and breads).The recommended dose for women before, during, and after pregnancy is 1,000 milligrams (mg) daily. (Teenage mothers need 1,300 mg daily.)Don't get more than 2,500 mg daily from all sources. Exceeding this safe upper limit can lead to kidney stones, hypercalcemia, and renal insufficiency syndrome. It can also interfere with your body's absorption of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc.If you're going to take calcium, also be sure to supplement with vitamin D.Vitamin D: This vitamin is important for bone growth and overall health. Vitamin D also helps your body absorb calcium, and research suggests it may lower the risk of osteoporosis, high blood pressure, diabetes, and several autoimmune diseases.Sun exposure helps your body produce vitamin D, but many women don't get enough sun (especially in the winter and with the use of sunscreen) to make an adequate amount, and experts think the small amount found in food might not be enough. The best way to know whether you're getting enough vitamin D is to have your blood tested.The 2010 U.S. Dietary Guidelines and Institute of Medicine both recommend that all women get 600 IU (15 micrograms) of vitamin D daily, but no more than 4,000 IU. Very large amounts of vitamin D  more than 10,000 IU daily  may cause kidney and tissue damage.By the way, breast milk doesn't supply your baby with enough vitamin D. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies who are exclusively breastfed or who drink less than 32 ounces of formula daily receive a supplement of 400 IU (10 micrograms) of vitamin D each day too. Talk to your baby's doctor about a vitamin D supplement.Vitamin D is important for bone development and the prevention of rickets in children. Experts think that getting enough vitamin D in childhood may also help prevent certain conditions, like osteoarthritis, from developing later in life.DHA: The DHA content of your breast milk depends on your diet, particularly on whether you eat fish. So if your diet doesn't contain a few servings of cold water fish or other food containing DHA (like fortified eggs) every week, you might consider a supplement.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfeeding moms get 200 to 300 mg of DHA a day.Daily food and meal plans for breastfeeding momsChart of daily food group servings for breastfeeding moms.Sample meal plans for breastfeeding moms.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

10 ways to make your pregnancy pounds pay off,https://www.babycenter.com/0_10-ways-to-make-your-pregnancy-pounds-pay-off_10396238.bc,"Pregnancy gives you a very important reason to gain weight: To nourish a baby and keep yourself healthy, you'll need additional calories, nutrients, vitamins, and minerals.(You can find out how much food you need every day in our article on meal planning during pregnancy.)But what's the healthiest way to do that, while maximizing nutrition and avoiding the bad stuff?1. Dont cut out fatsThe key is to choose nutritious ones. After all, the fat in a doughnut and the fat in an avocado are not created equal. As much as you can, pick healthy fats; the avocado's monounsaturated fats are a lot better than the saturated or trans fats found in a doughnut or pastryand it has vitamins C and K, as well.Eating healthy fats will have a positive impact that lasts beyond pregnancy, says Bridget Swinney, a registered dietitian in Texas and author ofEating Expectantly: Practical Advice for Healthy Eating Before, During, and After Pregnancy.""Your body will store some of the fat you eat to use in your breast milk. For the healthiest breast milk, limit saturated and trans fats now and while you're breastfeeding,"" Swinney says. Find out more about healthy fats pregnant women need and where to get them.2. Choose foods that pack a nutritional punchEat foods that give you more for every bite, like yogurt, which contains calcium, potassium, and protein, and is also a powerful source of probioticsthe good bacteria that helps keep digestion healthy.Other great picks are berries like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and cranberries. These are rich in vitamin C and fiber, but they're also packed with antioxidants, which help fight inflammation.Mushrooms are another nutritional star, says Swinney.""Mushrooms are a good source of minerals like selenium and copper, and they're also the only natural vegetarian source of vitamin D,"" Swinney says. ""Some contain the daily value in one serving.""Find out more about the best foods for pregnant women.3. Eat the whole spectrumTo make sure you're getting a broad range of nutrients, try to load up on colorful fruits and vegetables as often as possible.Try dark green kale, ruby red strawberries, and orange squash. Swinney encourages pregnant women to aim for three cups of vegetables and two cups of fruit each day.In fact, fruits and veggies should fill half your plate at every meal, according to new guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).(Want more info? The USDA offers a customized eating plan for moms-to-be that corresponds to your stage of pregnancy.)And while it's often true that the deeper the color, the more nutritious the veggie, that's not always the case. Vegetables such as cauliflower and cabbage are full of nutrients.So are white potatoes, which often get a bad rap. A medium potato has only 110 calories and provides more than a third of the daily vitamin C needed during pregnancy, plus 2 grams of fiber. (Sweet potatoes are extremely rich in beta carotene but boast less vitamin C.) All the more reason to bake one up, add toppings, and call it lunch or dinner.The dietary danger lurks in the serving size and the preparation: its news to no one that French fries  whether they're made from sweet or white potatoes  are high in fat and saltnot too mention temptingly easy to overindulge in.Nutty brown also counts; try whole wheat breads or pasta to maximize your nutrients. If youre already used to brown rice and whole-grain oatmeal, consider trying some new grains like bulgur and millet.4. Pair foods to maximize their goodnessSome foods are even better together. No, we're not talking about peanut butter and jelly (though that can be a tasty, healthy snack), but rather about foods that enhance each other's nutritional benefits.For example, foods rich in vitamin C  like citrus fruit, melon, berries, broccoli, cabbage, and tomatoes help your body absorb the iron from beans, grains, and eggs. So spoon salsa on your scrambled eggs or black bean tacos, or serve them with a side of melon or steamed broccoli.Or try pairing a prebiotic food with a probiotic food to boost the effects of both. Prebiotics (such as bananas, artichokes, asparagus, onions, and whole grains) encourage the growth of healthy bacteria in your gut, while probiotics like yogurt, kefir, aged cheese, sauerkraut, miso, and tempeh contain gut-healthy bacteria alreadyso one supports the other. Some winning combinations: yogurt with banana, artichoke hearts drizzled with a Greek yogurt sauce, or diced asparagus in miso soup.5. Cook from scratch when you canBy making meals at home, you can control the ingredients, and you'll wind up with better quality, often for less money. For example, many store-bought salad dressings use less expensive  and less healthy  oils than those you'd use at home.One idea: Make your own olive oil-based salad dressing to pour over a spinach or kale salad, then add avocado. Olive oil and avocado help your body absorb more lutein, which is important for eye and brain health, and beta carotene, important for the immune system.Many people are intimidated by cooking fish, but it can be a snap. Cover a slab of salmon with some pesto sauce or olive oil, salt, and pepper, and cook in the microwave for about 3 to 5 minutes or the oven for 12 to 15 minutes at 450 degrees. Salmon has omega-3 fats that help build your baby's brain and eyes.You can also make sweets like quick breads or cookies at home using healthier fats (canola oil or mashed avocado) and less sugar. (You can usually cut the sugar in a recipe by a third without noticing.) Try replacing some of the oil with high-fiber foods like black beans or prunes. And sneak in some extra nutrients by adding dried fruits and nuts.6. Rethink your drinksIt's important to stay hydrated during pregnancy, but how you do it can make a big difference. Steer clear of soda, sweet tea, and sugary fruit drinks and juices  they're full of empty calories. Water, milk, or vegetable juice are better choices.Drinking one-hundred100 percent juice (without added sweeteners) can be a great way to get one serving of fruit. Juice has a lot of natural sugars and calories, though, so limit your intake to one cup a day.Pick juices with powerful nutrients. Cranberry juice may help prevent urinary tract infections; apple juice contains phytochemicals linked to improved respiratory health; and orange juice is rich in vitamin C, potassium, and folic acid, which are important for your babys development.If plain water doesn't appeal, try a spritzer: Pour sparkling water into a glass and add a splash of fruit juice or pureed fruit (watermelon and mint tastes great).7. Embrace eggsThey're cheap, easy to prepare, and great for your baby. A large egg is roughly 80 calories, over half of which comes from the yolk. Speaking of which, if you've been an egg-white omelet aficionada until now, pregnancy is a time to rethink that. Both the egg yolk and the white contain healthy lean protein.And yolks are packed with vitamins such as choline, which is important for your baby's developing brain  and may help your memory, too.""When I was pregnant, I added a hard-boiled egg a day as a snack,"" says Jessica Corwin, a registered dietitian and community nutrition educator for Spectrum Health in Michigan. ""Eggs might contain a little cholesterol, but they're full of nutrients and an easy, affordable way to get choline into your diet.""8. Break out the beansPacked with protein and dirt cheap, beans can be a meal unto themselves. To make a big pot, soak dried beans overnight in water; drain the next day; add water to cover; and toss in garlic, onion, and spices; then cook until tender. Add them to a salad, combine them with rice, or team with a portion of meat for a well-balanced meal.""Beans have protein, fiber, carbs, and no fat unless it's added,"" says Eleana Kaidanian, a New York registered dietitian who counsels pregnant women. ""They have great iron content and they're really filling.""Legumes include beans, peas, and lentils, and there are so many varieties, you can't get tired of them,"" says Kaidanian.9. Choose treats that add valueBreak out the dark chocolate. Though it does contain sugar and fat, it shouldn't be on your ""unhealthy"" list, says nutritionist Bridget Swinney. ""Chocolate, especially dark chocolate, contains antioxidants that may actually help blood pressure,"" she says.Still, Swinney advises sticking to small amounts. She recommends 1 to 2 tablespoons of cocoa or half an ounce of dark chocolate a day. (That's about what you'd get in a cup of hot cocoa, three dark Hershey Kisses, or one and a half Dove Promises.)Another healthy splurge: dark chocolate-covered almonds. Just 11 contain 25 percent of your vitamin E for the day.Or go for frozen yogurt or low-fat ice cream, which contains protein and calcium. Punch up the nutrition by topping it with sliced banana and slivered almonds.10. Snack smartSnacking and pregnancy are a good fit: Having smaller, more-frequent meals or snacks can help ward off morning sickness, indigestion, and heartburn. And healthy snacking provides a steady stream of nutrients to your developing baby.But don't let regular snacking morph into all-day eating. Brush up on how much extra you need to be eating, which may be a lot less than you think.""To stick to a well-balanced weight, pregnant women don't have to eat much more,"" says Ashley Roman, director of the NYU Maternal Fetal Care Center.You can often get the extra calories you need in one healthy snack  yogurt with fruit, cheese and crackers, apples and peanut butter. ""Not a hot fudge sundae,"" Roman says.Bonnie Rochman is a health writer who is at work on a book about how genetics is reshaping childhood."

There are many different forms of ABA, including positive behavior support (PBS) that aims to identify the reason for problematic behaviors and replace them with more appropriate behaviors, pivotal response treatment (PRT) focusing on such important areas of development as motivation or self-management, discrete trial training (DTT) using a very systematic and step-by-step approach, natural environment training (NET) which takes place in a familiar setting, and early intensive behavioral intervention (EIBI) for very young children.aripiprazole: A medication used to treat irritability related to autism in some children ages 6 to 17.Asperger's disorder, or Asperger's syndrome: The name formerly used for a type of pervasive developmental disorder marked by difficulty with social interactions, obsessive interests, a monotonous or rigid voice, and often unusual, repetitive behaviors. Most people with these symptoms are now considered to have autism spectrum disorder, although anyone previously diagnosed with Asperger's may still identify with the term.autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or autism: A brain disorder marked by problems with communication, social interaction, and restricted, repetitive behaviors or interests. Restricted, repetitive behaviors may include constant twirling, hand flapping, or being focused on one topic or activity  lining up toys in a particular order or being obsessed with trains, for example. People with autism also may be especially sensitive to noise, bright lights, or touch. Signs of autism must be apparent from a young age, even if they aren't recognized until later. Symptoms can range from mild to severe and may be associated with other health conditions or intellectual or language disabilities. There is no cure, but there are many treatment approaches and therapies that can help people with autism. There are no drugs to treat autism, either, but medication may ease common symptoms such as aggressive behavior, tantrums, anxiety, depression, and irritability.cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT): A therapy approach that aims to help people recognize and manage their emotions and moods, leading to improved behavior. It's often used to help reduce anxiety and fear, particularly in high-functioning children.complementary and alternative therapy: These are unconventional treatments and therapies that aren't typically recommended by most doctors. Examples include dietary changes (like eliminating casein and gluten from a child's diet), melatonin to ease insomnia, nutritional supplements (such as multivitamins), oxygen treatments, compression vests, and chelation therapy, which claims to remove certain chemicals from the body. These methods are generally unproven, and some may be dangerous.Developmental, Individual Difference, Relationship-based (DIR)/Floortime Model: An intervention approach that involves following and encouraging children's natural interests to meet developmental milestones.Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM): The American Psychiatric Association's standard reference guide used to define autism and other conditions that affect the brain. The 5th edition  DSM-5  published in 2013 changed the way autism is diagnosed. Four disorders (autistic disorder, Asperger's disorder, childhood disintegrative disorder, and pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified) were eliminated from the previous edition and replaced with one diagnosis: autism spectrum disorder, with three levels of severity. DSM-5 also created a new diagnosis  social communication disorder. This condition includes some people who don't meet all the new criteria for an ASD diagnosis but have problems with communication.Early Intervention Services (EI): Free, federally funded state services for children younger than 3 who have, or are likely to have, a developmental delay. Each child has an Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP) describing the child's needs and services, which may include some of the behavioral and physical therapies described in this list.Early Start Denver Model (ESDM): A behavioral early intervention approach for children as young as 12 months old through preschool age to improve social skills. Usually provided in familiar, comfortable settings, such as at home or preschool, it emphasizes relationships: Therapy techniques are used during playtime, and parents are essential partners in modifying their child's behavior.Extended School Year (ESY) Services: Treatment and support services provided during long school breaks, such as summer break or winter holidays, to avoid regression in skills.504 plan: An educational plan to help public school students with physical or mental impairments function in a regular classroom. The 504 plan is legislated under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a federal civil rights statute. Children who aren't eligible for an individualized education program (IEP) may qualify instead for a 504 plan, which is overseen by teachers and has less parent involvement than an IEP.Free Appropriate Public Education (FAPE): Federal law requires public schools to provide free educational services and support tailored to meet the individual needs of disabled children so that their educational experience is comparable to that of classmates who don't have a disability. FAPE falls under the 504 plan.Individuals with Disabilities Education Improvement Act (IDEA): A federal law that ensures public schools meet the educational needs of disabled students. It spells out special education services for children with disabilities including autism, learning disabilities, and speech or language impairment.Individualized Education Program (IEP): A detailed, written plan, worked out among parents, educators, and therapists, to educate and support a child with special needs between the ages of 3 and 21. It requires reevaluation every three years, though parents can request annual reevaluations.Individual Family Service Plan (IFSP): An early intervention treatment plan for children younger than 3 who have  or are likely to have  a developmental delay. It spells out the child's needs and services, which may include behavioral and physical therapy and must be provided free of charge.joint attention: A child's ability to share attention and interests with other people by pointing to something or showing an object, or by using eye contact and other cues, like smiling or clapping.least restrictive environment (LRE): Under IDEA, schools must include children with disabilities in regular classroom activities as much as possible. Students may need assistance in the classroom, such as physical accommodations or an aide. This is sometimes known as ""mainstreaming"" or ""inclusion.""nutritional therapy: A strategy usually developed with a registered dietitian or nutritionist to ensure children get enough nutrients and calories for healthy development. A customized meal plan can help address problems caused by food aversions, constipation, and side effects of medication. It can also help with digestive problems, a common issue in children with autism.occupational therapy (OT): Teaches practical skills for everyday life, such as bathing, getting dressed, eating, staying safe, and managing routine social interactions. It also helps children with hand-eye coordination, fine motor skills needed to write or grasp toys, and strategies for positive behavior. It often involves sensory integration therapy as well.pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS): In the DSM-4, children who were on the autism spectrum but didn't meet all the criteria for any specific subtype were diagnosed with PPD-NOS. DSM-5 eliminated PDD-NOS, folding it into autism spectrum disorder, but anyone with a previous PDD-NOS diagnosis may still identify with the term.physical therapy (PT): Strategies to help with movement and motion, such as toe-walking, repetitive movements, weak muscles, and difficulty planning and carrying out actions. PT also improves motor skills such as balance, coordination, and walking.risperidone: An antipsychotic medication for children ages 5 to 16 to help manage irritability, tantrums, self-harm, and aggression  behavior problems found in some children with autism spectrum disorder.sensory integration therapy: Helps children who are very sensitive to certain sensory experiences, such as sound, touch, sights, or smells, by teaching them ways to regulate and control their reaction. It's often part of occupational therapy.social (pragmatic) communication disorder (SCD): A disorder characterized by verbal and nonverbal communication problems from an early age. It includes difficulty learning and using words as well as inappropriate responses in conversation. This is a relatively new diagnosis that was established in 2013 in the DSM-5.special education services: Educational services provided by local public school districts for children with special needs age 3 and older. Each child has a custom plan called an Individualized Education Program, or IEP.speech therapy: Focuses on communication skills to help children express themselves better, which can decrease frustration and improve behavior. Speech therapy can help children participate in conversations, follow directions, write, and ask for help. Children who don't speak may learn to use gestures, pictures, and sign language to communicate.TEACCH (Treatment and Education of Autistic and related Communication handicapped Children): An intervention that focuses on organizing the child's environment and using visual cues to help children understand and carry out tasks and activities.Show sources Hide sources AACAP. 2011.

10 ways to avoid gaining too much pregnancy weight,https://www.babycenter.com/0_10-ways-to-avoid-gaining-too-much-pregnancy-weight_10396224.bc,"It can be challenging to stick to the guidelines forpregnancy weight gain, especially if you've never craved carbohydrates so much in your life and it seems like everywhere you turn, people encourage you toeat for two.But gaining too much weight while pregnant can raise your risk for birth complications likec-section deliveryand premature birth. And even if you start pregnancy overweight or obese  like more than half of American women  sticking to the recommended range of weight gain can significantly reduce your risk of health problems likegestational diabetes andpreeclampsia.Below, doctors and nutritionists offer 10 important  and achievable  tips for healthy pregnancy weight gain.1. Start pregnancy at a healthy weight if possible""The most important thing you can do before getting pregnant, in addition to takingprenatal vitamins, is to start your pregnancy at a healthy weight,"" says Lauren Hyman, an ob-gyn in West Hills, California.If you're at the ""thinking about it"" stage of pregnancy, or trying to conceive, consider making apreconception appointment. Your healthcare provider can help you figure out your currentbody mass index(BMI) and suggest ways to lose weight if necessary.How to stay fit and healthy during pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:11Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:11Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videos2. Eat moderately and oftenYou don't need that many extra calories per day to nourish your growing baby. Currentguidelinescall for 340 extra calories per day in your second trimester and 450 extra calories per day in your third trimester if you're starting pregnancy at a healthy weight. (If you're underweight or overweight, these numbers will differ based on your weight gain goal.)That's not a lot of extra to play around with, so choose foods that pack a big nutritional punch and help you feel satisfied.""Focus on small, frequent meals that are high in lean proteins, fruits, and vegetables,"" says Hyman. Learn more aboutmeal planning during pregnancy.Then choose healthy snacks between meals.""Eating a healthy snack every three hours should help you avoid overdoing it at mealtimes,"" advises dietitian Frances Largeman-Roth, author ofFeed the Belly: The Pregnant Mom's Healthy Eating Guide. Not only will you be providing good nutrition for your baby, but your blood sugar will stay level throughout the day so you're less likely to feel starving at dinnertime.Choose meals and snacks that include protein, fiber, and some healthy fat, says Largeman-Roth. Examples include an apple with two tablespoons of peanut butter, an English muffin with a scrambled egg and spinach, protein-enriched pasta and tomato sauce, or Greek yogurt with a palmful of nuts or granola sprinkled on top.Fruit with lots of fiber and high water content  like grapefruit, oranges, apples, berries, pears, and plums  can also help you feel full and keep constipation at bay.3. Drink up (water, that is)It's important to avoid dehydration during pregnancy  and drinking enough water has the added benefit of helping you feel satisfied between meals and snacks.The Institute of Medicine advises pregnant women to drink 10 8-ounce glasses of water or other beverages each day. Some nutritionists suggest adding morefor each hour of light activity. Largeman-Roth recommends three liters of water daily, or 101 fluid ounces.Other experts suggest monitoring urine color: If it's dark yellow or cloudy, your body needs more fluids. Sip throughout the day to keep your urine color pale yellow or clear  a sign of proper hydration.Drinking water also easesconstipation, one of the less happy side effects of growing a person inside of you. When you're pregnant, your digestive system slows down, which ensures that you wring every possible bit of nutrition from your food. Getting enough fluids will help keep things moving along and prevent uncomfortable bloating.Largeman-Roth, who recently gave birth to her third child, ups her water intake by keeping a pretty glass or water bottle with her at all times and chilling pitchers of water with sliced lemon, lime, or cucumber to make it more appealing. ""You drink more when your water tastes good,"" she says.4. Make your cravings constructiveNo one expects you to avoid french fries and ice cream completely when you're pregnant. After all, cravings come with the territory.The key is to satisfy your urges while getting theproteinandhealthy fats that you and your baby need (and that will help you feel full).""A little trick I use is to combine something healthy with one of my less-healthy cravings,"" says Largeman-Roth. ""For example, I mix a high-fiber cereal with some really yummy granola on top. You get the fiber you need to help prevent constipation, plus the sweet crunch you're craving.""When Largeman-Roth was pregnant and craved the salty satisfaction of chips and salsa, she toasted a tortilla, then topped it with a fried egg and a pile of shredded cheese, salsa, and diced avocado.""It has more calories than just the chips,"" says Largeman-Roth, ""but it packs in a lot more nutrients."" The added protein from the cheese and egg will help you feel full longer.5. Make starches work harderCarbohydrates can be a pregnant woman's best friend, especially if you're battling the nausea and vomiting ofmorning sickness. But simple starchy food such as white bread, rice, and pasta raise your blood sugar without giving you the nutrition that comes with whole grains.Better to reach for complex carbohydrates  such as brown rice, quinoa, andwhole grainbreads and pastas  which not only provide you and your baby with more nutrients, but will help you feel full for longer and make you less likely to give in to unhealthy cravings later in the day.6. Start a simple walking regime""The most valuable thing any pregnant woman can do is walk,"" says Jeanne Conry, past president of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists. For expecting moms who are new to exercise, Conry recommends a program she calls ""10 Minutes for Me."" She has her patients walk 10 minutes a day and keep track of when they do it. Every 30 days, she has them add another 10 minutes, so that by the end of the first trimester they're walking 30 minutes daily, which they can continue to do for the rest of pregnancy.Boston ob-gyn Laura Riley, who is medical director of labor and delivery at Massachusetts General Hospital, suggests that her patients purchase pedometers and shoot for 10,000 steps a day. It may sound daunting, but remember that steps done while running errands and walking around the office still count.""It's not just important for managing weight gain,"" says Riley. ""You'll have a lot fewer aches and pains as you get to the end of pregnancy if you stay active.""7. If you're already moving, don't stopUnless your workout routine includes competitive kickboxing or other risky activities for expecting moms, there's no reason you can't keep it up during pregnancy.With the exception of contact sports, Riley tells her patients to ""do whatever they normally do  running, walking, aerobics, whatever. There are very few things you cannot do during pregnancy.""You may have to modify your movements as your girth grows and your center of gravity changes, but otherwise, says Riley, there's no reason you can't stick to your usual activity.Learn thebest kinds of exercise during pregnancyand find outwhen it's not safe to work out.8. Have the occasional indulgenceLargeman-Roth satisfied her pregnancy sweet tooth with a half-cup serving of full-fat ice cream (about the size of a tennis ball) served in a small bowl to make it look bigger.Hyman, the California ob-gyn, agrees that her patients shouldn't deprive themselves of a favorite treat. Instead of making that indulgence a daily habit, though, she advises enjoying it once a week.9. Make weight a regular discussionHaving a conversation about weight gain with your doctor or midwife at every prenatal visit will help you stay on track and make changes if you need to.Conry calculates her patients' body mass index (BMI) at the first visit, then gives guidance onpregnancy weight gain.""I tell them what their goals are and what will happen during the different trimesters,"" Conry says.Calvin J. Hobel, a maternal-fetal medicine expert at Cedars Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles, studies the health of women during and after pregnancy. He recommends that doctors show women how they are gaining on a curve to help them stay on track.""Seeing where you are at the beginning and then watching your trajectory is very important,"" says Hobel.To see where you land on the weight-gain curve, and learn how much you should gain based on your height and pre-pregnancy weight, try BabyCenter's pregnancy weight gain estimator.10. Breastfeed if you canWhile this tip won't help during pregnancy, it's worth knowing that breastfeedingcan help you meet your goals for healthy weight loss afterward.""Breastfeeding is the best fix for losing the extra weight you've gained during pregnancy,"" says Hobel.When breastfeeding goes well, it burns 500 calories daily. Also, birth and the body changes that happen in the first six weeks postpartum should help you drop your first 20 pounds (just from the baby, placenta, and water weight leaving your body). It's a great jump start to losing your pregnancy weight.Kate Ropeis a freelance writer and editor and coauthor ofThe Complete Guide to Medications During Pregnancy and Breastfeeding.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015a.

How to eat when you're trying to conceive,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-eat-when-youre-trying-to-conceive_1460692.bc,"If you're trying to get pregnant, practicing good eating habits now can help you have a healthy pregnancy once you conceive.""What you eat affects everything from your blood to your cells to your hormones,"" says Cynthia Stadd, a nutrition specialist at the Berkley Center for Reproductive Wellness in New York City.But no matter how balanced your diet is, it's still important to take prenatal vitamins to reduce the risk of having a baby with neural tube defects. Most experts recommend that all women start taking folic acid at least a month before trying to get pregnant.Read on for more tips about eating a healthy diet while trying to conceive.Curb caffeineIt's unclear whether caffeine can affect fertility. There's some evidence that very high consumption  more than 500 milligrams a day, or about three to four 8-ounce cups of coffee depending on the strength of the brew  might interfere with fertility. But experts generally agree that low to moderate caffeine consumption (less than 300 milligrams a day, or about two 8-ounce cups of coffee) shouldn't make it harder for you to get pregnant.What does your OB-GYN want you to know before getting pregnant?

See all videosBecause no one knows for sure how caffeine impacts fertility, some experts suggest lowering your caffeine intake even more or giving it up entirely, especially if you're having difficulty conceiving or if you're undergoing in vitro fertilization.Once you're pregnant, experts recommend getting no more than 200 milligrams of caffeine a day (a little less than a 12-ounce cup of coffee) because higher amounts have been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage.Read more aboutcaffeine and fertility, including the amount in other beverages and tips for cutting backOvulation CalculatorFind out when you're likely to ovulate  and boost your chances of conceiving.Eat lots of fruits and vegetablesThink of produce as Mother Nature's multivitamin. Fruits and vegetables deliver a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, and getting enough of certain nutrients is especially important before you conceive.For example, veggies like spinach, romaine lettuce, asparagus, and broccoli are high in the B vitamin folate. (Folic acid is the synthetic form.) Eating foods rich in folate during preconception and pregnancy can help prevent neural tube birth defects, such as spina bifida. Produce that's high in vitamin C  such as citrus fruit, strawberries, broccoli, and tomatoes  can help your body absorb iron more easily, and iron is an important mineral for women who become pregnant. (See ""Pump up your iron intake"" below.)In general, choose fruits and vegetables in a range of colors to get the most nutritional bang for your buck. (Eating a produce ""rainbow"" gives you a wider variety of nutrients.) Choose fishSeafood is the best source of omega-3 fatty acids, and according to some scientists, these essential fats may have a positive effect on fertility. Research suggests that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids may help regulate ovulation, improve egg quality, and even delay aging of the ovaries.Omega-3s are also important for a baby's brain and eye development and could have many other pregnancy-related benefits. These include lowering your risk ofpreterm birth, reducing your chance of preeclampsia, and easingdepression.On the other hand, you've probably also heard that some types of fish contain contaminants such as mercury. In high doses, this metal is harmful to a baby's developing brain and nervous system.The good news is that not all fish contain a lot of mercury. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that women trying to conceive can safely eat up to 12 ounces (roughly two or three servings) a week of fish like canned light tuna, salmon, shrimp, cod, tilapia, and catfish.However, the FDA advises limiting white (albacore) tuna and completely avoiding fresh or frozen swordfish, tilefish, king mackerel, and shark because these have the highest mercury levels.You can take fish oil supplements if you don't like seafood, but first talk to your doctor about which brand to buy and how much you should take.Read our article oneating fish when you're trying to conceivefor more advice on mercury and omega-3s.Pump up your iron intakeFill your body's iron reserves before you get pregnant, especially if your periods are heavy. According to Sam Thatcher, a reproductive endocrinologist and author ofMaking a Baby: Everything You Need to Know to Get Pregnant, ""Bleeding every month is a constant source of iron depletion.""Make sure to get enough iron now  once you're expecting, it's difficult for your body to maintain its iron level because your developing baby uses up your stores of the mineral. (Pregnant women need double the amount of iron they needed before pregnancy.)Too little iron at conception not only can affect your baby, it can also put you at risk for iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy and after you give birth (especially if you lose a lot of blood during delivery). Anemia causes your red blood cells to fall below normal and saps your energy.If you don't eat much red meat, or if you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, your healthcare provider may recommend that you take a prenatal vitamin containing extra iron. And to be on the safe side, ask your healthcare provider to test you for anemia at your preconception checkup. Eat whole grainsA woman trying to conceive should eat as many nutrient-rich foods as possible, and whole grains are a great place to start, says nutrition specialist Stadd.The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food guidelines recommend that you make at least half of the grains you eat each day whole grains (such as bran cereal, oatmeal, brown rice, or whole wheat bread). Refined carbohydrates (like white bread, pasta, and white rice) won't directly lower your chance of getting pregnant, but they do shortchange your body because the refining process strips grains of key nutrients such as fiber, some B vitamins, and iron.Note: If you havepolycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS), the most common cause of infertility in women, pay extra attention to the types of carbs you eat. PCOS is a hormonal imbalance that can get worse when insulin levels in the bloodstream surge, and refined carbohydrates are a main cause of insulin spikes.Mark Leondires, fertility specialist and medical director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of Connecticut, explains that when women with PCOS eat too many refined carbohydrates, insulin flows into the blood, feeds back to the ovaries, and can lead to irregular ovulation.Avoid alcoholAn occasional beer or glass of wine probably won't hurt your odds of conceiving, but having two or more drinks a day can. Moderate drinking can also increase your risk of miscarriage. You may want to skip alcohol completely when you're trying to conceive because it can be hard to tell exactly when you get pregnant, and alcohol can harm a developing baby.For nonalcoholic alternatives, see our list of thebest ""virgin"" drinks.Be aware of listeriaListeriais a bacterium that can contaminate lunchmeats, soft cheeses, and unpasteurized dairy products. Pregnant women are more likely than other healthy adults to get sick from eating contaminated food, and the infection caused by listeria (listeriosis)can cause amiscarriageearly in the first trimester  possibly before you even know you're pregnant.To kill listeria, heat high-risk foods in the microwave until they're steaming hot. To reduce bacteria growth on leftovers, set the refrigerator's temperature to 40 degrees or less. Toss any food that's been at room temperature for more than two hours.Do not eat these foods:raw fish and sushi, refrigerated smoked seafood (like lox), soft cheesemade from unpasteurized (raw) milk, other unpasteurized dairy products, and refrigerated pt or meat spreads. (Canned or shelf-stable spreads are safe to eat.) Choose other proteinsProtein is a critical part of a healthy diet, but according to the USDA, many Americans rely too heavily on beef, pork, and chicken to get their daily amount. In a study of 18,555 women, experts at Harvard Medical School found that those who included one daily serving of vegetable protein  such as nuts, beans, peas, soybeans or tofu  were less likely to have infertility due to ovulation problems.More research is needed on the link to fertility, but because vegetable proteins are usually lower in fat and calories than steak or fried chicken, including them in your meal plans is both good for you and a great way to maintain a healthy weight.To get a personalized nutrition plan that includes the amount of protein, grains, and produce you should eat daily, try the USDA's SuperTracker tool.What about hisdiet?When it comes to fertility and diet, men don't get a free pass. Lisa Mazzullo, an ob-gyn and assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, recommends that fathers-to-be take a daily multivitamin that contains zinc and selenium for at least three months before conception. Studies suggest these minerals aid in healthy sperm development.Why start so early? The sperm your partner ejaculates today was actually created more than two months ago. It takes about 74 days for sperm to fully develop and benefit from the supplementation.""Genetic preparation is going on during sperm development, so that's pretty heavy stuff,"" says Amy Ogle, a registered dietitian in San Diego, California, and coauthor ofBefore Your Pregnancy: A 90-Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception.Learn more:Dietary changes men can make to boost fertilityFolic acid: Why you need it before and during pregnancyPrenatal vitamins: Why they're so importantEating fish when you're trying to conceive: How to avoid mercury and still get your omega-3sUSDA SuperTracker tool: Get your personalized nutrition planShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

Family size in America: Are large families back?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_family-size-in-america-are-large-families-back_1503367.bc,"Posh Spice has three, and says she'd love more. Will Smith and Jada Pinkett have three. So do Tom Cruise, Angelina Jolie, and Madonna, thanks to adoption. With celebrities breaking the two-kid barrier, big families suddenly seem as trendy as jumbo-sized sunglasses and handbags.And if you read the news reports, you might think it's not just Hollywood but regular American families that are going super-sized. ""Get ready for the new baby boom,"" proclaims a recent headline from Life magazine. ""For more parents, three kids are a charm,"" says USA Today.We decided to cut through the buzz and find out whether big families really are on the upswing, and  more important, if you're one of the 50 percent of BabyCenter moms who want a big family  what life is like for multiple-kid moms. Here's what the experts, both the academic and the real-mom kind, had to say:Are big broods back?Not really, says Steve Martin, a sociologist at the University of Maryland. When Martin crunched the numbers from a 2004 government survey  the most recent available  he found that 28 percent of women age 35 to 44, who are winding up their childbearing years, have three kids or more. Ten years ago, it was 29 percent. The numbers for younger women haven't budged much, either.Martin says it's not so much that big families are back, as that they never disappeared in the first place. ""Large families have consistently been common,"" he points out. ""Two is the norm, but for every 34 mothers who stop at two, there are 28 who have three, four, or more.""So why does it suddenly seem like you can't walk down the street without tripping over a double-wide stroller and a few toddlers?Despite the nationwide numbers, big broods could be a trend in certain areas, says S. Philip Morgan, sociologist and demographer at Duke University. ""You do get clusters of behavior that are very real,"" he says. ""But it's not appropriate to generalize them across the country, because there are other pockets that are behaving very differently.""Morgan doubts that America will see a 1950s-style baby boom  when women had four kids, on average  anytime soon. ""My forecast is more of the same in the United States,"" he says. ""There are people who want substantially more than the two-kid average, but that's been going on for a long time.""Who's having three or more kidsWhile the percentage of moms having Brady Bunch-sized broods has held steady, the women who make up their ranks have changed somewhat. These days, professional and wealthy moms are having bigger families  traditionally more common among certain religious groups and poorer women with less education, according to government surveys.Professional moms have twice as many kids at home, on average, than their high-powered counterparts did back in 1977, according to a 2002 report from the Families and Work Institute. And in a 2000 study, sociologist Martin found that college-educated women who put off motherhood until their 30s are suddenly having families almost as big as everyone else's. ""That's historically unprecedented,"" he says.Carolyn Moe fits the profile of this new kind of big-family mom. The mother of three is vice president of sales for a global technology company, and says she never doubted she could combine a successful career with more than two kids. ""In the past, women may have felt they had to fit some label of what a working woman should be. This generation is all about creating the life you want,"" she says.Wealthier families in general seem to be warming up to the idea of moving past a tasteful two. ""Our survey from 2002 found that 12 percent of higher-income women had three or more children,"" says Anjani Chandra, a researcher at the National Center for Health Statistics. ""The figure from 1995 is only about 3 percent.""Part of the reason that wealthier people are having more kids may simply be that there are more of them. ""In this country there's been a pretty dramatic increase in people with higher incomes,"" says demographer Morgan. ""And if you like kids and can afford them, why not?""Finances played a role in the Newmarks' three-kid family. Mom Kate says she and her husband, who runs his own engineering business, discussed how they would be able to comfortably afford each child. ""We talked about whether I would be able to stay home,"" she says. ""And with each kid we were like, 'Here's another college tuition.'""It may seem as though women such as Moe and Newmark have nothing in common with the more stereotypical big-family mom  working class, religious. But there is a common thread, says Julie V., who was at one time the moderator of BabyCenter's Large Families bulletin board and mother of four. Julie saw all sorts of women on the board, and the only description that fit them all, she says, is the obvious one: They love kids and want lots of them.Pediatrician JoAnn Rohyans of Columbus, Ohio, says that's what unites her big-family patients, too. ""They just really enjoy their kids and think that two is not enough. They don't want their jobs as parents of school-age kids to end so quickly!""Why moms want large familiesStatistics show that big broods tend to, well, run in families: Women who grow up with lots of brothers and sisters are more likely to have lots of kids themselves. But on our Large Families bulletin board, that's not the case.""Some of our moms are onlies, and most have just one or two siblings,"" says moderator Julie V. And at least a few of them are looking to give their own kids the companionship they say they missed out on.""I was an only child,"" says Patience Soares, mother of five. ""I always get so jealous of people who are close to their siblings. My husband's family does everything together  birthdays, Christmas, cookouts. I want my kids to have that. And they'll always have each other, even if something happens to us.""Others say they wound up with bundles of babies because the more they had, the more they enjoyed it. ""I always say that after three, it's all downhill,"" says Leslie Biskup, who's working on number six. ""I'm so much more relaxed and patient than I was with my first two.""Newmark hadn't planned on having any kids, let alone three, but says that once she became a mother she felt a strong urge to expand her family. ""It's hard to put into words, but I just didn't feel done,"" she says. ""I felt like there was someone not here who should be here.""What's life like for big-family moms?In a two-kid country, a basketball team-sized brood can attract attention, not all of it friendly. ""I've heard everything from, 'Five kids, are you nuts?' to, 'You do know what causes pregnancy, right?'"" says Billie Jean Sheffron.Almost all the moms in this story report getting at least the occasional nasty comment, sometimes from their own family. ""Every time I tell my mother I'm pregnant she rolls her eyes,"" says Leslie Biskup. ""She says she's supportive, but my parents just don't get why I'd want so many kids.""The most common query isn't mean, though, just curious: ""You must have your hands full. How do you do it?"" The questioners have a point. Five kids may mean five times the love, but it's also five times the mess, the meal planning, and the chauffeuring.""I think the hardest thing is how relentless it is,"" says Talitha Gawkoski, mother of seven. ""There is always dirty laundry, no matter how many times you do the wash. Someone is always hungry, no matter how much food you provide.""That said, our moms make it clear that a big-family home may take a lot of work, but it's not as chaotic as some small-family parents might imagine. Most mothers we spoke with who have five, six, seven, or even eight kids have spaced them out fairly widely, and often the eldest are grown and out of the house. And even if they're all still at home, the parents are rarely wrangling all of them, from teenagers to toddlers, at once. ""In a way it's like having two families, the little kids and the big kids,"" says Leslie Biskup.They also say that parenthood goes more smoothly when you have more experience under your belt. ""Going from no kids to one kid, and from one to two kids was actually the harder transition,"" says Melissa Brown. ""By the time the fourth came around, it was like, 'Welcome to the family.' No big deal.""Another common question  how do you afford it?  is also worth asking. You don't have to be rich to afford a large brood, but you probably will have to make some sacrifices. Most of our moms spoke of having a smaller house, older cars, and fewer fancy vacations than their small-family neighbors. ""Other people have things, we have children,"" says Talitha Gawkoski.But Gawkoski and other large-family moms are happy with the trade-offs. They made the decision to have a big family with their eyes wide open, and wouldn't change a thing if they could. ""Everywhere I look I see someone I love, and they're all such wonderful people,"" says Gawkoski.Are big families good for the kids?Most big-family moms think that all the sibling togetherness, including the squabbling, teaches their kids a lot about how to love and get along with others. ""To me one of the biggest advantages is that they learn so much from each other, and at such an early age,"" says Sherry Welden, mother of six. ""They learn responsibility, how to share, and how to care for each other. I really notice a difference between my kids and kids from smaller families.""The idea that brothers and sisters teach each other social skills is a popular one among big-family moms, and there's research to back it up. A 2004 study of more than 20,000 kindergarteners across the country found that teachers rated students who had at least one sibling as having an edge in social skills: better at making friends, better at helping other kids, and more tuned to the feelings of others. (The catch: having any siblings was what made the difference, and kids with lots of brothers or sisters didn't have any advantage over those who had just one.)Researchers have also turned up some downsides to big families, although experts argue about how valid they are. About a hundred years of studies  from the 1870s to the 1970s  found that on average, the bigger the family, the lower the intelligence of the kids. One theory holds that as a family grows, the parents have less time and money to devote to each child's education and intellectual development.But some researchers think IQ scores have more to do with socioeconomic characteristics  large families are still more common among low-income parents with less education, and kids tend to match their parents' academic achievement. ""It's factors like income and education that the studies are actually measuring,"" says psychology professor Joseph Rodgers of the University of Oklahoma.Rodgers also believes the effect of family size on both intelligence and social skills pales in comparison to parenting styles.""Imagine two households, one with four children and one with two,"" he says. ""In one household the parents spend a lot of quality time with their kids, the house is filled with books, and the food on the table is nutritious. In the other the parents pretty much ignore the kids and sit around watching TV. What do you think is more important: The number of children or the quality of the parenting?""BabyCenter Seven: Life lessons from large familiesHow do you do it? That's one of the questions our big-family moms hear most often. Every family does it differently, but our moms did have this advice to share with anyone contemplating a bigger brood:Make a list""Organization, organization, organization,"" says Billie Jean Sheffron, when asked how she manages her brood of soon-to-be-five. Sheffron is a big believer in lists: She makes weekly schedules for chores, menus, and the kids' activities, as well as daily and weekly to-do lists for herself. ""If you've got four kids and try to throw dinner together at the last minute with whatever's in the fridge, for example, it's just not going to work,"" she says.Get some alone time with the kids""When I run errands I'll take one of the kids while the others spend quality time at home with Daddy,"" says Julie V. Julie and her husband also take advantage of staggered bedtimes to get some one-on-one TLC time with each of their four children. Talitha Gawkoski's family has started a birthday tradition: When her kids turn 16, they get to go anywhere in the continental United States with their dad as a birthday present.Let the big kids be kids, too""I have a hard time with parents who turn their older children into second parents,"" says Gawkoski, mother of seven. Everyone has chores in her house, but Gawkoski makes a point of not leaning on her older kids for help with the younger ones. And when they do hold down the fort  on date night, for example  she pays them.Get creative with spaceSherry Welden has her six children play musical bedrooms so each one gets a chance to have his own room. Welden also helped cut down on the traffic in their one bathroom by putting hair dryers and mirrors in the older girls' bedrooms.Keep your relationship on the front burnerWith a gaggle of kids demanding your time and attention, it's easy to let couple time slide into last place. But some big-family couples do manage to make time for each other. ""We're good at taking time for us,"" says Kelly Bauer, mother of eight. ""Our kids know that it's important. We both want to have a solid foundation, so things will be strong between us when the kids are grown.""Separate wants from needsMany of the big-family moms buy in bulk, cook from scratch, buy clothes off-season, and pack up the van and drive instead of paying for a fistful of plane tickets. And of course, they follow the hand-me-down system. Leslie Biskup, mom of five, says that, contrary to popular opinion, you don't have to be wealthy to raise lots of kids  you just have to redefine what's really necessary. ""Kids are as expensive as you make them,"" she says. ""People with one or two kids say to us, 'You must be rich!' But they're dressing their kids in Abercrombie & Fitch and spending all their time in Gymboree.""Don't plan on a showpiece home""I used to be a neat freak before I had kids, and I couldn't imagine living in chaos. Now I let things like that go and focus on taking care of and loving my children rather than having a clean house,"" says Sherry Welden."
"A healthy pregnancy diet, Latino style: Portion sizes for common foods",https://www.babycenter.com/0_a-healthy-pregnancy-diet-latino-style-portion-sizes-for-comm_10302511.bc,"Food listTake a look at this list to get an idea of the wide variety of foods you can choose from to make up your healthy pregnancy diet. Next to each food item, you'll find the quantity that makes one portion. For instance, ""Arepa: 1/2"" means that half an arepa is equal to one serving of carbohydrates.This will make it easier to follow our healthy pregnancy eating plan. Included are many delicious Latino ingredients that you can enjoy while pregnant. CarbohydratesThe average woman needs nine daily servings of carbohydrates (which are also referred to as starches).Legumes, grains, cereals, starchy vegetables, fruit, and milk all contain about the same amount of carbohydrate per serving. (Nonstarchy vegetables, such as leafy greens, contain fewer carbohydrates.) The key to controlling blood sugar is to balance the number of carbohydrate choices at each meal and snack.This is particularly important for Latino women. Certain ethnic groups that have a high rate of diabetes, including Hispanics, are more likely to develop gestational diabetes.It's best to vary your carbohydrate choices as much as possible, selecting from all of the different categories. Each day, for example, aim for a serving or two of legumes, some grains, some cereals, three servings of milk, some fruit, and a couple of servings of starchy vegetables, in addition to three cups of nonstarchy vegetables. .Choose whole grains over refined products whenever you can. In fact, at least half of the grains you eat should be whole grains.Whole wheat breads and corn tortillas, for example, are better options than varieties made from white flour. Unrefined grains like brown rice contain more vitamins and fiber than those that are refined, and they don't make your blood sugar rise as rapidly.

A good goal is to eat at least one serving of raw vegetables every day.In general, a 1-cup portion of vegetables is equivalent to 1 cup of vegetable juice, 1 cup of cooked vegetables, or 2 cups of leafy greens. These nonstarchy vegetables contain very few carbohydrates.Vegetables that are high in vitamins A and C are orange, red, yellow, or dark green. Vitamins A and C are important for a healthy pregnancy, so it's recommended that you eat these colorful vegetables every day.Good vegetable sources of vitamin A(Choose at least one a day.)Carrots and carrot juiceChinese cabbageKaleMixed vegetablesRed peppersSalsaSpinachGood vegetable sources of vitamin C(Choose at least one a day.)BroccoliBrussels sproutsCauliflowerChilesGreen tomatoKalePeppers, red and greenCabbage, red Other vegetablesAlfalfa sproutsArtichokesAsparagusBeetsCabbageChayoteCucumberEggplantHearts of palmJcamaLettuce (all types)Maguey or yucca flowersNopalitosMushroomsOkraOnionPumpkin flowersSquash (yellow, green, and calabacitas)Tomato, jitomate, jitomatilloTurnipVerdolagaWatercress FruitThe average pregnant woman should eat four servings of fruit per day.

(Cheese is too, but for the purpose of meal planning, it is counted as protein.)1 serving equals:Evaporated skim milk: 1/2 cupNonfat plain yogurt: 6 oz (2/3 cup)Powdered nonfat milk: 1/3 cupNonfat milk or 1% milk: 1 cupKefir, low-fat jocoque: 1 cup (+ 1 fat)2% reduced-fat milk: 1 cup (+ 1 fat)Reduced-fat soy milk: 1 cup (+ 1 fat)Whole milk or soy milk: 1 cup (+ 1.5 fat)ProteinThe average woman who drinks three servings of milk needs about 7 ounces of meat/meat substitutes per day. It's best to have the protein divided between meals and snacks.Legumes also provide an excellent source of protein. They are listed in the Starch section above.In the following lists, foods that aren't measured in ounces have one-ounce equivalents noted. Some sources of protein (like the high-fat meats and meat substitutes listed below) contain a lot of fat, so it's better not to eat them more than once or twice a week.Lean meat and meat substitutesBeef (select or choice, round, roast, sirloin, tenderloin)Egg whites: 2Egg substitute: 1/4 cupLamb (roast, chop, leg)MenudoPork (Canadian bacon, ham, tenderloin)Poultry without the skin (chicken, Cornish hen, duck, turkey)Shrimp, shellfish, sardines, tunaWhite fish (tilapia, sole, hake)Wild game Medium-fat meat and meat substitutesBeef (corned, ground, prime rib, short ribs, tongue)Cheese with 4 to 7 grams of fat per ounce (see list below)Eggs: 1Fried fishPoultry (chicken with skin, ground turkey, fried chicken)SalmonHigh-fat meats and meat substitutesBaconBologna with 8 or more grams of fat per ounceCarnitasHigher-fat cheese (see list below)Hot dogsLunch meat with 8 or more grams of fatMachacaPork (ground, sausage, spareribs)Sausage with 8 or more grams of fat (bratwurst, chorizo, Italian, Polish, smoked, summer)Plant-based meat substitutesLegumes are a popular lean-meat substitute and are listed under Starches.

However, some cheeses have a lot of fat and calories, so be careful with your choices.And you should avoid certain soft cheeses during pregnancy. (See those italicized, below.) To be safe, don't eat any cheese made from raw milk. Make sure that the label on the cheese says it's made from pasteurized milk.Less-fatty cheese (contains up to 7 grams of fat per ounce)1 serving equals:Asadero: 1 ounceCottage cheese: 1/4 cupFeta: 1 ounceMozzarella, part skim or regular: 1 ounceParmesan, grated: 2 tablespoonsQueso blanco (white Mexican cheese): 1 ounceQueso fresco (fresh Mexican cheese): 1 ounceHigher-fat cheese (contains 8 or more grams of fat per ounce)1 serving equals:American: 1 ounceBlue cheese: 1 ounceBrie, Camembert: 1 ounceCheddar: 1 ounceChihuahua: 1 ounceCotija: 2 tablespoonsMonterey Jack, with or without jalapeo pepper: 1 ounceMuenster: 1 ounceProvolone: 1 ounceSwiss, Gruyre: 1 ounce FatsAim for about six servings (1 teaspoon each) of fat per day while you're pregnant.Keep in mind that much of the fat in your diet is already in the foods you eat. Added fats (like mayonnaise on your sandwich or dressing on your salad) and those used in cooking (like lard and oil) can add hefty amounts to the total fat and calories in your diet. So limit your fat intake, but don't eliminate fats altogether  they're necessary for a healthy pregnancy.Cooking with vegetable oils such as olive oil instead of animal fats such as lard and butter is better for your cholesterol count as well as your overall health and your baby's.

The family meal,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-family-meal_1436248.bc,"Between parents' and children's busy schedules, sitting down together for an evening meal can be a challenge, but there are plenty of good reasons not to let this tradition disappear from your home.Studies show children in families who eat together regularly tend to eat more fruits, vegetables, and dairy products. Other studies suggest that kids who sit down to regular family meals are less likely to be overweight or have eating disorders. It's the stability, communication, and time spent together that make the ritual of regular meals a habit worth ingraining in your family while your children are young.Here are some ways to make this goal a pleasure, not a chore.Pick a meal any meal. It doesn't have to be dinner. If you have time in the morning to have breakfast together, make that your group meal. Be sure you have enough time, though: The meal shouldn't be rushed or stressful.If family meals aren't a habit for you now, consider starting with two or three group meals a week. Try to work up to five to seven meals a week  the number one study indicated may promote health benefits for teens.Take advantage of snacks. Avoid serving two distinct meals at different times, one for the kids and one for the grown-ups.If your child is starving at 5 p.m. but everybody won't be together until 7 p.m., consider giving her a protein snack in the late afternoon to tide her over. Then eat together later.Plan menus ahead. Lose the what-to-cook worries by thinking through the week's meals. Choose which days to cook and which days to pull something from the freezer. Shop for menu items once a week to save time and have everything you need on hand.The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics points out that family mealtime is the perfect opportunity to make sure the whole family gets enough of the four ""gap"" nutrients adults and kids often lack:Potassium, found in vegetables including potatoes, spinach, broccoli, and tomatoes, and in such fruits as oranges and bananas. Dairy products, seafood, and beans are other good sources.Fiber, found in beans, peas, potatoes, greens, oranges, mangoes, whole grains, and nuts.Calcium, found in dairy products and foods that have been fortified with the mineral.Vitamin D, found in fortified foods, fish, and egg yolks.In some urban areas, families may find it convenient to order groceries online through such resources as Safeway and Peapod. Check online to see if your local grocery store has a delivery service. Though you may still want to hit the stores to choose fresh produce.Stock up. Keeping your pantry well stocked helps make sure you have everything you need to whip up a quick meal. This is also a good fallback strategy for ""last resort"" days when plans change and you need to make something nutritious  fast.Buy a variety of meat and fish in bulk, and store them in meal-size packages in the freezer. (See Freezer Facts.) Don't overlook some quick-prep foods, such as microwaveable brown rice and mashed potatoes, frozen tortellini, pancake mix, and prewashed salads.Prep ahead. If you tend to have more time in the morning, wash and trim the vegetables you plan to cook later. Cut up broccoli or carrots and put them in the fridge in a covered pot of water.Consider posting the day's menu on the refrigerator. Writing it down reminds you what you need to do in the morning and lets you or other family members know what needs to be done later in the day.Think fast. Many nutritious meals can be microwaved, stir-fried, or broiled  all speedy ways to cook. If you're using a cookbook, look for recipes where the prep and cook time combined are less than an hour. Save more elaborate meals for weekends.Plan to have leftovers. Make double batches of such foods as soups, stews, and casseroles, so you can just heat and eat on some days. Or make something that does double duty. For example, cook extra potatoes and set up a baked-potato bar (with veggies and cheese) one evening for dinner and then use the leftovers for a potato salad the next day.Buy partially prepared foods. Save prep time by buying grated or cubed cheese, prewashed spinach, or skinned and boned chicken breasts, for example. These will undoubtedly cost more, so balance cost with time. Sometimes it's worth paying a bit more when you really need to save time.Speed things up with takeout. Most supermarkets sell such ready-to-eat items as hot rotisserie chicken, pasta salads, and sandwiches. Some stores also have an extended salad bar that features hot soups and other prepared meals.Develop family favorites. You don't need to reinvent the wheel with each meal. Put together a short list of quick, reliable meals. Maybe in your house it's fish every Monday and pizza every Friday.Mix up meals. Serve breakfast or lunch for dinner. Eggs, pancakes, waffles, grilled cheese sandwiches, soup  even a bowl of cereal with sliced fruit  can all be the basis of quick, serviceable dinners.Change the venue. Plan a picnic after soccer practice instead of heading for the drive-thru if that works best on some days. Or eat off paper plates on the front porch.Keep it light. Don't use mealtimes for lectures or topics that could lead to arguments. The point is to enjoy being together.Turn off the TV. It's a good way to keep the focus on each other!"
How to avoid making meals a power struggle (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-avoid-making-meals-a-power-struggle-ages-5-to-8_66882.bc,"For many families, sitting down for a meal together often means arguing over food  what's on the menu, who's eating (or not eating) what and how much. But who wants that night after night? Read on to learn how to prevent food fights at the family table.How can I avoid arguing with my child over food at every meal?Nutritionists say it's your job to decide what, when, and where to eat, and it's your child's job to figure out the rest. Provide your child with reasonable, healthy food choices, but dont force her to eat. As difficult as it may be, its important to give your child some control  and you may be surprised to learn how good children can be at self-regulation when it comes to food.""It's your child's decision whether or not to eat, what to eat from what is being offered, and how much of it,"" says Nancy Hudson, a registered dietitian at the University of California at Davis.To avoid squabbles at supper, try not to talk about food at the table and simply serve the meal without comment. Make meals a stress-free time when you talk together about pleasant things.Of course, if your child is a picky eater, holding your tongue can require a lot of restraint. But your child will benefit in the long run if you don't harp on her eating habits throughout the meal.What if my child refuses to eat what I serve?Your mom may have rewarded you with a bowl of ice cream for cleaning your plate, but that just demonstrated that veggies were the punishment and dessert was the reward. Instead, consider these tips:Don't become a short-order cook, preparing special meals just to appease your child. And don't give snacks close to mealtime  your child is more likely to eat if she's hungry.Involve your child in planning and preparing meals. She may be more likely to eat what's on the table if she has a hand in fixing it.Let your child serve herself from several healthy choices at the dinner table, rather than loading up her plate for her in the kitchen. That way she learns to make her own decisions about what and how much to eat and be responsible for her choices.Serve at least one food you know your kid likes, don't discuss eating habits, and clear the table when the meal is over  even if your child doesn't eat all her food. It's okay if she's still hungry after dinner.If your child turns up her nose at a new food, don't be afraid to serve it again. Try cooking it a different way or serving it raw. Kids often need to be exposed to a new food several times before they learn to like it. Give it time and don't force it.Take the time to talk to your child about how nutritious foods make her feel better, give her more energy, and help her body grow strong. When she makes a healthy choice, compliment her by saying something like, ""That's going to help you have strong muscles!"" or ""I like that too!""If she wants dessert, give it to her without much fanfare, but consider serving fruit instead of a sugary treat. Offering more nutritious desserts along with occasional treats like ice cream encourages healthy habits.Its important to be a good role model. If your child sees you enjoying your meals, shes more likely to enjoy hers as well.How can I be sure my child is eating well enough?Remember that your child is the one in control of what she puts into her body. Deciding for your child when she's hungry or when she's had enough to eat ultimately does her a disservice.""She won't learn to recognize when she's hungry and when she's done, and you're setting her up for eating problems later, such as obesity, overeating, or controlling food,"" says Hudson. ""Children are amazingly good at self-regulation. They may eat almost nothing one day, and then the next day they eat a ton of food.""If you watch what your child eats over the course of a week or a month, you'll see that she does a pretty good job of getting what she needs from different food groups (as long as you offer a healthy variety).For more help, check out our articles on coping with picky eaters.Show sources Hide sources NIH. 2012.

Planning your preschooler's birthday party: Food,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-preschoolers-birthday-party-food_10348961.bc,"Light fareIf your party falls at breakfast, lunch, or dinner time, a light meal is appropriate. Kids this age typically aren't big eaters  especially at a party where they're distracted by activities and friends. Pizza is an easy standby that both adults and kids enjoy.But you can also be inventive without getting too elaborate. Layered sandwiches (cream cheese and jelly) or quesadillas (preassemble and heat in the oven) are healthful and you can prep them ahead of time.If you serve juice boxes, consider putting them up high and asking the parents to pass them out to their own offspring  otherwise, the kids might guzzle three or four apiece.Pleasing the parents' palatesIf the party occurs at mealtime, you'll also need to feed the adults. Fire up the grill and cook mini hamburgers for the kids and big ones for the parents, or order cheese pizzas for the kids as well as some with fancier toppings. A platter of cheese and crackers seems decadent, and it's easy.For drinks, sparkling water, lemonade, or even just a pitcher of water with a few slices of lemon is sufficient. You can do more if you want to, but remember, you're not hosting a cocktail party.On a budget?Want to reduce costs? Pick a time between meals, say 10 to 11:30 a.m. or 3:30 to 5 p.m., and you can get away with serving snacks, drinks, and cake.You can even have fun with tying simple snacks to your theme. At a dinosaur party, you can put out dino eggs (hardboiled eggs), and at a firefighter fest you could serve red foods, such as sliced cherry tomatoes and strawberries.Food safetyMost 3- and 4-year-olds chew well enough to eat all foods, but youngsters  especially 3-year-olds  are still at risk for choking when they're racing around. Play it safe and avoid the foods that children most commonly choke on, such as whole grapes and popcorn.Sweet treatsPreschoolers expect something sweet at the end of a party, but remember: A birthday treat can come in all shapes and sizes. Consider a muffin tower or cupcakes decorated to look like animals or flowers. Use a shaped cake pan to tie into your theme. Of course, there's nothing wrong with baking a regular cake from a mix or ordering one from the grocery store or bakery.When lighting candles, remember that your little guests are likely to think it's their birthday, too, so everyone might try to blow out the candles. It's wise to have a few extra matches on hand."
Planning your child's fifth birthday party: Food,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-fifth-birthday-party-food_10349544.bc,"After running around and playing games, 5-year-olds will be hungry, and if they like the food you serve, they'll eat  often a lot. You'll please all your pint-size party guests  even the picky eaters  by putting out a varied, colorful spread of food.Healthy snack attackHomemade foods are healthy, look beautiful on the table, and will feed both the children and the adults. You can create a mini salad bar by filling small bowls or a large platter with cherry tomatoes, mini carrots, celery sticks, broccoli, cheese, garbanzo beans, and (if you don't mind picking up tiny pieces afterward) corn, and peas. The kids can munch on the display or fill little bowls with what they like.Finger foodsTo accompany the salad, you can put out finger sandwiches, quesadilla triangles, mini quiche, and English muffin or pita bread pizzas. Kids this age appreciate it when you're imaginative with the presentation and cut the sandwiches with fun-shaped cookie cutters and make faces on the pizzas using olives and sliced peppers  even though they might pick off the toppings!Super simpleCreating a spread like this can take a lot of work. If you want to keep it simple, even most finicky 5-year-olds will eat a slice of cheese pizza or a hot dog. To add something healthy to the menu, serve watermelon slices or strawberries. Or you can avoid serving a meal by picking a party time that falls between meals  that way, you only need to plan for snacks, drinks, and cake.The main attractionThe cake is one of the main highlights for 5-year-olds, and they love it when you tie the cake into the theme  a Superman figurine rising above the frosting, a Word Girl illustrated with icing. A store-bought cake is acceptable and much easier  and your guests will never know the difference. Just be prepared for the kids to argue over who gets the piece with SpongeBob's head. Usually, the birthday child gets first dibs!"
Planning your preschooler's birthday party: The invite list,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-preschoolers-birthday-party-the-invite-list_10348958.bc,"A typical 3-year-old doesn't fully understand the meaning of friendship and might not have strong bonds with playmates, so you can consider constructing the guest list without soliciting his opinion if that's easier on you. But most 4-year-olds are familiar with the notion of a ""friend,"" and they will have some opinions about the children you should invite.An intimate gatheringA small group of children your child knows through preschool, play group, or the neighborhood tends to work best with 3- and 4-year-olds. A good rule of thumb is one guest for each year, so that means three or four guests. (Invite a couple of extras if you want, though, because at the rate preschoolers get sick, it's likely you'll have a no-show or two.)Count on parents staying for the party since children this age typically aren't independent enough for a drop-off party.Crowd controlDo you have a large extended family or live on a block full of kids? A big shindig might seem like more fun to you. You can successfully pull this off if you stick to the basics  gather everyone in the backyard or at the park (less mess in the house!), barbecue burgers, pass out some bubbles, and play music.But even if you create a relaxed, low-pressure atmosphere, be prepared for your child to melt down. If this happens, don't be afraid to pull him into a quiet space for a moment where you can talk and snuggle. Some individual attention will help your child feel more comfortable in the big group.Twice the funHere's another option: Rather than one big party, consider holding two smaller gatherings.For example, you could invite your family for dinner the evening of your child's actual birthday and then host friends on the weekend. Or you could gather the neighbors at the park for cake after dinner and then pick another day to take a few preschool friends on an outing. If you go this route, make it easy on yourself and keep the two events simple  a family potluck plus a trip to the ice cream parlor with a few friends, for instance.Also, there's nothing wrong with sticking to a family party. Three-year-olds who aren't in preschool might not have strong bonds with friends yet and may feel more at ease with their relatives.Crafty invitesWhile your child probably can't write the invitations, he can help with the process. You could scan one of his drawings and print it out to make invitations. Or you could print out simple outlines of a flower, say, or a ladybug, and ask your child to color them in. No time for handmade invites? Let him help choose cards at a shop or online. Also, there's nothing wrong with emailing an invitation.Be sure to include a reply-by date, an end time, and any special instructions for guests (wear paint clothes, come in your pajamas, and so on). Also let parents know whether or not you'll be serving a meal for them and their kid."
Planning your preschooler's birthday party: Timing it right,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-preschoolers-birthday-party-timing-it-right_10348959.bc,"The perfect timeMany kids this age still nap in the afternoon, so plan the fiesta around the siesta. Pick a time that's in the morning or late afternoon. If you don't want to prep a full meal, an ideal time is 10 a.m. to 11:30 a.m.The perfect lengthKeep the party short and sweet: Plan on 90 minutes to two hours max. Preschool-age kids get wound up at birthday parties, and the longer the festivities go on, the more likely the kids are to lose it.Two times the fun?You may wonder what to do when your child's birthday falls during the week and you're holding the party on the weekend. Do you honor your child twice? It's up to you. If you think two parties is too much, you can pretend your child's actual birthday is on the day of the party. (Kids this age aren't tracking the calendar yet!)Or you could cook a special dinner the night of the birthday for family and then gather friends on the weekend. Just be sure to explain the plans to your child ahead of time to avoid frustration. For example, if you'll make dinner on the actual birthday but hold off on the cake and presents until the weekend party, make sure this is clear to your child so she isn't disappointed when no cake shows up the night of her birthday."
Planning your child's sixth birthday party: Timing it right,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-sixth-birthday-party-timing-it-right_10349564.bc,"The perfect timeTwo hours is just about right at this age. You'll have time for a meal or snacks, cake, several games, and an art project. It's unlikely any of the kids are still napping at this age, so you have a lot of flexibility on timing. Still, morning is a good bet because kids can be worn out near the end of the day. You can opt for 10 a.m. to noon if you don't want to serve a full meal, or for 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. and dish up lunch.If you throw your party in the afternoon, try to wrap it up by 5 p.m.  6 at the latest. Many 6-year-olds go to bed by 7 or 8  even earlier than some preschoolers  because they're no longer napping.Two times the fun?If your child's actual birthday is during the week and his party on the weekend, you may be wondering if you have to celebrate twice. The answer is a qualified yes. A 6-year-old will know about the two important dates and will probably expect some acknowledgement on his actual birthday, in addition to the party with friends. On his birthday, you could cook his favorite meal or go to dinner. You don't need to bake two cakes or give presents on both days. Just explain ahead of time what you're planning each day so your child knows what to expect."
Planning your 7- or 8-year-old's birthday party: What to eat and drink,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-7-or-8-year-olds-birthday-party-what-to-eat-an_10349715.bc,"Snack attackFirst, think about whether you want to take on the task of serving a full meal. You'll lessen your expenses and workload if you stick to snacks. It's totally acceptable to pick a time for the party that falls after breakfast and before lunch, or after lunch and before dinner. You can put out bowls of popcorn, pretzels, and carrot sticks, and serve a cake  and the kids will be satisfied.A real mealIf you do have a party at mealtime, pizza, hot dogs, hamburgers, macaroni and cheese, and other classic kid foods are a surefire hit at this age. You can decide on one main item to serve, then fill a bowl with potato chips, slice some watermelon, heat up some corn on the cob, put out a bottle of ketchup, and you're ready to go. No need to feel pressure to create a fancy spread  especially now that the kids' parents won't be there!Top chefWhile it's a cinch to pick up the phone to order a pizza, this deprives your guests of half the fun: rolling up their sleeves and making the meal. Many 7- and 8-year-olds love to cook. If yours does too, you could revolve the whole party around it. Buy some cheap white aprons and have the kids decorate them with puffy paints, hand out little chef hats, and then the kids are ready.Pass out balls of pizza dough to roll out and cover with toppings, or make cupcakes ahead and the kids can decorate them with colored icing and candies. You can also set up a taco or ice cream sundae bar. Cookie cutters make perfect going-home favors.How much food do you need to serve? Seven-year-olds are typically light eaters so you can probably count on one hot dog or one pizza slice per child. Eight-year-olds have bigger appetites  especially if they've been running around  so plan on several kids eating two of what you serve.Sweet toothA sweet treat near the end of the party is still a highlight, but a traditional cake isn't necessary. Cupcakes, ice cream sandwiches, cookies, and ice pops are all great alternatives. Do have something you can stick candles into so everyone can sing ""Happy Birthday"" and your child can make a wish."
Planning your 7- or 8-year-old's birthday party: Timing it right,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-7-or-8-year-olds-birthday-party-timing-it-righ_10349713.bc,"Two hours is just about right at this age. Parties with school-age kids are infamous for devolving into bedlam. Sevens are known for burning through energy before suddenly, without any warning, dropping from fatigue. Eight-year-olds, on the other hand, just keep going and going and going  and it's you who might drop.Since you don't need to plan around naptimes, you can fit your party into any time of the day. If you want to serve lunch, 11 a.m. to 1 p.m. is good. Also, 3 p.m. to 5 p.m. can work well because many kids have soccer games, swim meets, and other activities in the morning on weekends. The other advantage to this time slot  after lunch and before dinner  is that you won't have to serve a full meal. You can get away with only snacks, which means less expense and work for you.Two times the fun?If your child's actual birthday is during the week and his party is on the weekend, you may be wondering if you have to celebrate twice. The answer is a qualified yes. A 7- or 8-year-old won't let you forget that he knows when his birthday is, and he'll expect some kind of acknowledgement on that day in addition to the weekend party. You could cook his favorite meal or go to dinner. You don't need to bake two cakes and give presents on both days. Just be sure to explain the plans to your child ahead of time so he knows what to expect."
Planning your child's fifth birthday party: Timing it right,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-fifth-birthday-party-timing-it-right_10349536.bc,"The perfect timeMany 5-year-olds have given up their naps, which gives you more flexibility in picking a time. But some 5-year-olds can still be tired and cranky in the afternoon. Late morning is still a good party time. That way, the kids are still pretty fresh, and you're not obligated to serve a full meal, so it's easier and less expensive.The perfect lengthTwo hours is a good length of time for a 5-year-old's party. There's nothing wrong with making it shorter or longer  but if you go over two hours you might want to incorporate some quieter games near the end to keep the kids from burning out.No end in sight?Throwing a big bash with lots of extended family, neighbors, and friends? Often these parties have a loose schedule and can last an entire afternoon. If the party is still hopping after five hours and scads of relatives are hanging out in the living room reminiscing about old times, don't be afraid to take your kid into his room to play quietly or rest if he's worn down. And even when you're inviting family, it's okay to specify an end time.Two times the funIf your child's actual birthday falls during the week and you're holding the party on the weekend, you'll need to decide if you want to celebrate twice. At this age, your child will likely know what date his actual birthday is and he'll appreciate a special meal cooked at home or a dinner out on his birthday in addition to his weekend party. Don't feel obligated to bake two cakes and give presents on both days. Just explain ahead of time what's happening each day so your child knows what to expect."
Planning your 7- or 8-year-old's birthday party: Games and activities,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-7-or-8-year-olds-birthday-party-games-and-acti_10349716.bc,"Game planWhen it's all over, 7- and 8-year-olds will remember a party for the games that made them laugh and cheer. With this age group, you have to dig a little deeper to come up with fresher, more challenging games than the ones they loved at 5. Duck, Duck, Goose isn't going to cut it!Big kids like to try new things, and they understand more complex rules and instructions. They also enjoy team games and competition. They no longer get upset about who goes first and who wins.This age can also focus on a quiet activity such as an art project for a good long while  in fact, you might struggle to tear them away when it's time to move on. You'll want to have about a dozen games ready to go and at least one project that lets the kids use their imagination and create something with their hands.Let's get this party startedYou'll want to begin with a game that allows kids to join in as they arrive. Bingo works well because you only need one or two guests to get started and when others arrive you just hand them a card and they can easily jump in. You might pass out stickers, erasers, or baseball cards as prizes.Treasure huntNext, you can get everyone up and moving with a treasure hunt. Hide clues around your house, backyard, or at a park, with each clue leading the search party closer to a prize. You can easily adapt a treasure hunt to the theme of your party. Throwing an insect party? Hide plastic ants, gummy worms, and bug stickers in a basket. A pirate party? Turn a paper box into a treasure chest and fill it with costume jewelry and chocolate coins.At a small party with up to eight kids, everyone can be on one treasure hunt team. For a larger party, you can divide them into teams and create separate sets of clues leading to different locations.After the hunt, you can serve a meal or snacks and then move on to some games. Musical Chairs, Ring Toss, Charades, Freeze Tag, Twister, and Pin the Tail on the Donkey (or variations such as Pin the Hat on the Snowman) are popular at this age.Team sportsTeam games particularly appeal to an 8-year-old's sociability: Try three-legged races, Blind Man's Bluff, Tug of War, and Capture the Flag. You can get creative with relay races. For example, divide your group into two teams and give each a suitcase filled with adult-size clothing. Someone screams Go! and then the first one in line puts on everything in the suitcase, runs 100 yards with the suitcase in hand, takes everything off and stuffs it all back in the suitcase, and then runs back to the line and hands over the case to the next person.Down timeAs the children begin to wear out, you can move to a quieter project (girls, especially, might like this). Play for 7- and especially 8-year-olds tends to be structured and focused on creating something tangible. You'll want to come up with a project  whether it's gluing scrap wood together to build toy houses or making construction paper party hats and decorating them with faux gems. Roll out a big piece of paper, pass out paints, and let the kids create a mural that ties into the party theme. Kids can really get into painting an ocean filled with pirate ships and islands, a faraway galaxy with spaceships and planets from Star Wars, or a jungle teeming with wild animals.Grand finaleAt the end of a party, the kids might enjoy a game of Tag or a water balloon toss. You could also walk over to a neighborhood park and kick a soccer ball around.Bounce houses are popular at this age. Make sure an adult is supervising  you might need two adults if you have a big group. Kids this age are infamous for attempting tricks they might not be capable of pulling off.If you hire an entertainer, you don't need to worry about kids this age being afraid of someone in a mask or full makeup. Eight-year-olds, though, can be quite skeptical and critical, so you'd be better off with no magician than a mediocre one."
Planning your child's sixth birthday party: What to eat and drink,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-sixth-birthday-party-what-to-eat-and-dr_10349566.bc,"Snack attackMany 6-year-olds love to eat and seem to snack all day. They're also known for filling their plates with more than you think they could ever possibly eat  and then stuffing it all down. For these reasons, you'd be wise to prepare a lot of munchies for the party. Crackers, cheese cubes, snap peas, mini carrots, blueberries, celery sticks spread with peanut butter, and hummus and pita triangles are snacks that 6-year-olds often like.A real mealIf you plan to serve breakfast or brunch, waffles or pancakes are always popular. To make it more festive, you can put out a buffet of toppings, such as sliced strawberries and bananas, coconut, chopped nuts, and butter and syrup.For lunch, consider a make-your-own-sandwich bar with bread, cheese, veggies, and meats. Kids this age enjoy preparing their own food. Just make sure you have enough sliced turkey or salami for everyone  if you run out you'll end up with some unhappy campers.The main attractionSix-year-olds like birthday cake, and by this age they probably have a strong opinion about whether they prefer chocolate or vanilla, so definitely ask which your child wants. If you and your child like to bake, you'll have fun making the cake together and decorating it with candy or toys that tie into the party theme. A store-bought cake is much easier, of course  and your 6-year-old guests won't care a bit that you didn't make it yourself."
Tips for toddlers: Healthy snacks and meals,https://www.babycenter.com/0_tips-for-toddlers-healthy-snacks-and-meals_10387676.bc,"Teach your toddler to savor delicious and nutritious food by serving a variety of healthy meals and snacks. Here are a few tips to get you started.Get your toddler to helpTap into your child's curiosity. Take your toddler shopping with you and let him pick out whatever fresh fruit or vegetable catches his fancy. Kids are more likely to eat and enjoy what they choose.Keep servings smallHow much your child needs to eat daily depends on her age, weight, and activity level. Most 1- to 2-year-olds eat between 800 and 1,000 calories a day.A healthy portion size for a toddler is about a quarter of an adult portion. There's no need to count calories  just remember to adjust portions accordingly.Don't worry about fatToddlers need to get about half their calories from dietary fat for normal growth and development. That may seem like a lot, but if your child is eating only 1,000 calories a day, you dont need to worry about him gaining weight too quickly.Once your child reaches the age of 2, gradually decrease the amount of fat in his diet until its less than about a third of his daily calories.Cut it upUntil children reach the age of 4, they can't chew food very well. Cut your child's snack into bite-size pieces. If you're serving vegetables, cook them first so they're soft, then chop them so they're easy to eat.Foods that may cause young children to choke include peanuts, whole grapes, whole cherry tomatoes, carrots, pumpkin or sunflower seeds, chunks of peanut butter, celery, and cherries with pits.Be flexibleIt's not unusual for young kids to do an about face when it comes to their favorite food. Your toddler may want the same lunch several days in a row, then suddenly decide he doesn't like it anymore. It can be frustrating, but try not to make a big deal about it.Have other healthy choices on hand. If you're offering something he hasn't tried before, just give him a tiny bit and serve it alongside a familiar food. And don't insist that he eat a full portion of something he's not used to.Cook togetherIf your toddler helps make a meal, she's more likely to want to eat it. Give her age-appropriate jobs in the kitchen, like washing vegetables, adding and stirring ingredients, and tearing up lettuce. Cooking together is an excellent way to foster good feelings about food.Keep it simpleEven if you love to cook, it's hard to find the time when you have young children.

How to avoid making meals a power struggle,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-avoid-making-meals-a-power-struggle_1186686.bc,"How can I avoid arguing with my child over food at every meal?For many families, sitting down for a meal together often means fighting over food  what's on the menu, who's eating (or not eating) what and how much.But who wants that night after night? To avoid squabbles at supper, try not to talk about food at the table. Simply serve the meal without comment.Of course, if your child is a picky eater, holding your tongue can require a lot of restraint. But your child will benefit in the long run if you don't harp on his eating habits throughout the meal.Be sure to provide your toddler with reasonable, healthy food choices, but don't force him to eat. You decide on the menus and mealtimes, and your child decides what to eat and how much.As difficult as it may be, it's important to give your child some control  and you may be surprised to learn how well children can self-regulate when it comes to food.""It's your child's decision whether or not to eat, what to eat from what is being offered, and how much of it,"" says Nancy Hudson, a registered dietitian at the University of California at Davis.What do I do if my child refuses to eat what I serve?Your mom may have rewarded you with a bowl of ice cream for cleaning your plate, but that just demonstrated that veggies were the punishment and dessert was the reward.Instead, try this approach: Serve at least one food you know your kid likes, don't discuss eating habits, and clear the table when the meal is over  even if your child doesn't eat all her food. It's okay if she's still hungry after dinner.Don't become a short-order cook, preparing special meals just to appease your child. And don't give snacks close to mealtime  your child is more likely to eat if she's hungry.If she wants dessert, give it to her without fanfare, but consider serving fruit instead of a sugary treat. Treating dessert as a reward for finishing her vegetables risks teaching her that vegetables aren't enjoyable. Offering more nutritious desserts along with occasional treats like ice cream encourages healthy habits.It's also important to be a good role model. If your child sees you enjoying your meals, she's more likely to enjoy hers as well.How can I tell if my child is eating well enough?Remember that ultimately, your child is the one in control of what he puts into his body. Deciding for your child when he's hungry or when he's had enough to eat does him a disservice. ""He won't learn to recognize when he's hungry and when he's done, and you're setting him up for eating problems later, such as obesity, overeating, or controlling food,"" says Hudson. ""Children are amazingly good at self-regulation. They may eat almost nothing one day, and then the next day they eat a ton of food.""If you watch what your child eats over the course of a week or a month, you'll see that he does a pretty good job of getting what he needs from different food groups (as long as you offer a variety). So, pull up a chair, relax, and try to enjoy your meal. If you do, your child will too.For more help, check out our strategies for feeding a picky eater.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012a.

Quick & Healthy Meals,https://www.babycenter.com/preschooler-quick-healthy-meals,
Do you make separate meals for your child?,https://www.babycenter.com/4_do-you-make-separate-meals-for-your-child_1746202.bc,
Backup childcare plans,https://www.babycenter.com/0_backup-childcare-plans_5935.bc,"What are my options when either my child or childcare provider is ill?Unfortunately, there aren't many options for emergency childcare, which is why so many parents dread the onset of a fever, diarrhea, or a stomachache. Most childcare centers have fairly strict sick-child policies to help prevent the spread of illness.And your challenge is even greater if you use home daycare, a nanny, or relative care because when your caregiver gets sick, there are no substitute teachers like at a center.Most backup options fall into two main categories: Finding someone else to take care of your child or staying home yourself. It helps to have a backup plan in place before you need it.Find someone elseAsk about backup care when you do your initial childcare search. Ideally, your home daycare provider, relative, or nanny (or her agency) will have someone else lined up in case of an emergency, though it's not ultimately their responsibility. If so, ask to meet the backup provider ahead of time to make sure you're comfortable having this person care for your child.If not, you could also:Ask a relative. If you have a reliable relative nearby who doesn't mind occasionally pitching in to care for a sick child, count yourself lucky. You may find yourself pledging your share of the family heirlooms to seal the deal, but if you can make it work, it's worth it.""I actually moved across country to get the backup support of my sister and mother,"" says Susan Webb, who relocated from Boston to San Francisco. ""Okay, maybe that wasn't the only reason, but it was a strong factor in our decision.""Try share care. If another family in your neighborhood uses nanny or relative care, try to arrange a childcare swap: They take your daughter when your nanny's sick, and you do the same for them. Even if you don't have a nanny and your friends do, this can still work  you pay their nanny, and they get your offer to babysit.Call an agency. If you found your nanny through an agency, ask if they have a roster of emergency caregivers. More rarely, you may be able to find an agency near you that provides in-home care for sick children. This will probably cost you an arm and a leg, but it may be worth it if you just can't miss work.Track down sick-child care. A few hospitals and childcare centers specialize in caring for sick children. Check online to see if there's one near you. Like in-home care, this option tends to be costly, but some companies will subsidize the expense to keep you from missing an important meeting or presentation.""Parents can get in a full day of work knowing that their sick child is being cared for by nurses and getting the right medical treatment,"" says Heather Luftman, director of Feeling Better, a sick-child center in Silicon Valley. In some bigger cities, like San Francisco, you may also find company-subsidized centers that offer last-minute childcare for healthy kids. That can come in handy if it's your caregiver  not your child  who's under the weather.Tap into your community. Your clergyman and local community college may be good resources for alternate caregivers, says Ann Douglas in The Unofficial Guide to Childcare. The former may have a list of willing helpers on hand, and the latter may be able to refer you to reliable student nurses. Plan ahead for this one and meet the person before leaving your child with her for the day.Another option is to try an online service that connects parents with on-call sitters who often have first aid and CPR training as well as background checks and references on file.Stay home yourselfNo one can prepare for every situation. Inevitably, the day will come when you're caught with a sick child and have no one to rely on but yourself or your partner. This option also has several variations:Take the day off. If you have enough paid time off available, this may end up being your only choice. If you don't, try to work out an arrangement with your boss. ""My employer is very understanding and flexible,"" says one BabyCenter mom. ""If I need to be out for a couple of days, I'm welcome to work extra hours during the week or come in on the weekend to make up time. That way I don't have to use up my vacation and sick days."" See if your boss will do the same.Work from home. Many employees have the option to telecommute now and then. As long as you can handle taking care of a sick child and getting your work done, this may be the best-case scenario.Take turns with your partner. If your child's sick for a few days, you can trade days off or split up each day up between you, like Sylvia Shragge and her husband Jim, of Berkeley, California. ""We've always handled it the same way,"" she says. ""Tag team! If our son is sick the night before, I'll go into the office extra early, stay a few hours, and bring work home. Then Jim goes to his office."""
Planned home birth,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planned-home-birth_168.bc,"Should I consider a home birth?If you're a healthy expectant mother having a normal pregnancy and you have no medical or obstetrical risk factors, giving birth at home may be an option for you.Giving birth at home allows you to labor and deliver in familiar and comfortable surroundings. You'll have more control over your birth experience than you would in a hospital, and you won't have to endure routine medical interventions.At home, as many family members or friends as you want can attend the birth, and you get to share the experience with them in the privacy of your own home, without interruptions from hospital staff. And all of your caregiver's attention will be focused on you and your baby.Giving birth at home isn't for everyone, of course. Moms-to-be who are more likely to have complications during childbirth should give birth in a hospital. This includes women with:Medical conditions, such as high blood pressure or diabetesA previous c-section or other uterine surgeryPregnancy complications, such as premature labor, preeclampsia, twins (or more), or a baby in the breech position at 37 weeksIf you choose to have a home birth, it's important to be flexible and understand that if complications arise, you might have to transfer your care to another provider or give birth in a hospital.You'll also need to be committed to giving birth without medication, preparing your home for the birth (including getting whatever supplies your caregiver recommends), and making plans to ensure that you have good support available to you in the days after you give birth.Another consideration: Not all insurance companies and HMOs cover the cost of home births. Live birth: Water birthWatch one mom give birth to her baby underwater.Is giving birth at home safe?For healthy women at low risk for complications who choose skilled and experienced caregivers and have a good system in place for transfer to a hospital when necessary, a number of studies show that giving birth at home is just as safe as giving birth in a hospital. There is also research showing that moms who planned to give birth at home (regardless of where they actually had their babies) ended up with fewer interventions, such as episiotomies and c-sections, compared with a group of equally low-risk women who had planned hospital deliveries.But home birth remains controversial in the United States. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and the American Medical Association (AMA) oppose home birth. They contend that the hospital is the safest place to give birth because capabilities of the hospital setting and the expertise of the hospital staff are immediately available if a complication arises suddenly.On the other hand, both the American College of Nurse-Midwives and the Governing Council of the American Public Health Association support the choice of women who are good candidates to give birth at home. They say that qualified caregivers, along with appropriate arrangements for backup and transfer, should be available for moms-to-be who want this option.If you're not sure whether you have medical or obstetrical problems that would keep you from having a home birth, contact a home birth provider and share your concerns over the phone. If there are no obvious reasons to rule out a home birth, you can make an appointment for a first prenatal visit.At that visit, the caregiver will do a detailed history and physical exam, as well as the usual set of lab tests. She'll continue to assess your situation throughout your pregnancy and during labor, birth, and the postpartum period. Giving birth with a midwifeFind out how a midwife helps a woman through pregnancy, labor, and birth. What else can I do to make sure that my home birth is as safe as it can be?Find a good practitionerLook for a certified nurse-midwife (CNM), a certified direct-entry midwife (CPM or CM), or a physician with plenty of experience delivering babies at home. Ask about her education, her credentials, and whether she's licensed to practice in your state.Be sure your caregiver carries the necessary equipment and supplies to start emergency treatment if needed, such as infant resuscitation equipment and oxygen, IVs, and medication to stem postpartum bleeding. It's also critical to make sure that she has an arrangement for backup with a qualified doctor and a nearby hospital in case you need to be transferred.Make sure your backup plan is solidMake sure the backup hospital is relatively close and that your transportation there is fail-safe in case something goes wrong and you need to get to a hospital quickly.Find a supportive doctor for your babyEstablish a relationship in advance with a pediatrician or family doctor (or group of doctors) in your community who'll be able to see your baby a day or two after he's born and is, ideally, supportive of your choice to deliver at home. (Your caregiver should be able to recommend one.)Line up postpartum helpArrange for extra help at home in the days following delivery. It's great if your partner can manage to take time off work to help you and to share this special time. If your partner can't (or if you want extra help), have a relative or friend come to stay for a few days, or hire a postpartum doula.How much does a home birth cost?The fees for home birth practitioners vary considerably from place to place and among caregivers. It's a good idea to find out not only what the home birth will cost but also what additional expenses you'd have to pay if you needed to be transferred to another provider or a hospital during pregnancy, labor, birth, or postpartum.Some insurance carriers cover home birth, but others don't. If you have insurance through an HMO that doesn't have an in-network provider who does home births, you may be able to get the HMO to provide some coverage for an out-of-network provider, although you'll probably have to be persistent. How can I find a caregiver to attend my home birth?Some resources to start with:The American College of Nurse Midwives in Washington, D.C., can direct you to home-birth resources in your area, including a list of certified nurse-midwives.

BabyCenter Seven: How to put the fun back into meals,https://www.babycenter.com/0_babycenter-seven-how-to-put-the-fun-back-into-meals_10415650.bc,"""Eat your veggies"" doesn't have to be such serious business. In fact, seasoned parents know that part of the trick to getting your child to eat well is to make food fun. So we've taken our favorite tips from BabyCenter moms and dads, who found that the way to a child's stomach is through her silly bone.1. Fairytale foodIf I'm having trouble getting my daughter to eat something, I'll link it to one of our favorite stories. For instance, spaghetti is made by Alfonso the Master Paster Maker from a Wiggles tale, or fish sticks were caught by Dora the Explorer in Crocodile Lake. It works wonders!Jesse, father of Sam and Mia, Martinez, California2. It's not just for breakfast anymoreMy kids are so excited to eat when I tell them we're having breakfast for dinner. We have eggs and toast or pancakes and bacon with apple and pear slices. It's a pretty well-rounded meal  they're getting grains, protein, and fruit.Sheila, mother of Audrey, Saint Paul, Minnesota3. Food towersTo get my daughter to eat a variety of foods, I encourage her to build something with the selections on her plate. She loves to make huge towers out of fruit, cheese, bread, and fruit. It works well with tortillas, too. She'll pile on cheese, vegetables, sour cream, etc. I try not to get hung up on what she's putting in her creations (just because I wouldn't eat olives on my apples doesn't mean she can't), as long as she eats it.Linda, mother of Ali, Oakland, California4. Pupu platterSometimes, when I don't have anything in the cupboard to make for dinner, my kids and I will put together a Pupu Platter. (What can I say? They love the name because it sounds like potty talk.) We put peanut or almond butter, cream cheese, raisins, and apple and banana slices in individual little cups and then we make mini faces on crackers.Jane, mother of Katlyn and Henry, Boulder, Colorado5. Soldier bread menWhen I was little, my mom used to serve us soft-boiled eggs in cute egg cups with soldier bread men  toast cut into strips that you dunk into the egg. Now my boys are huge fans of this protein-packed meal!Katie, mother of William and Charlie, Edgewood, Rhode Island6. Color foodsWe often pick a color and fix a meal around it: orange mac n' cheese, orange slices, cheddar crackers, and orange-flavored sparkling water. It's actually kind of fun and the girls love it. Not always easy to be well-rounded, but you can make it work.Julie, mother of Katharine, and Leah, Vallejo, California7. Life's a picnicEvery once in a while we mix up mealtime by putting a blanket on the floor and having a picnic in the living room. During the winter we plop down in front of the fireplace and pretend we're having a campfire. It turns an ordinary meal into a real treat.David, father of Zach and Gabriel, Seattle"
Birth plan: Your expectations and preferences,https://www.babycenter.com/calculators-birthplan,"What is a birth plan?A birth plan is a document that lets your medical team know your preferences for things like how to manage labor pain. Keep in mind that you can't control every aspect of labor and delivery, and you'll need to stay flexible in case something comes up that requires your birth team to depart from your plan. But a printed document gives you a place to make your wishes clear.A written birth plan also helps refresh your healthcare provider's memory when you're in labor. And it informs new members of your medical team  such as your labor-and-delivery nurse  about your preferences when you're in active labor.Most hospitals and birth centers provide a birth plan worksheet or brochure to explain their policies and philosophy of childbirth, and to let you know what your birth options might be. That information can help guide you in a discussion with your provider about your preferences when you face choices along the way. And that discussion can be the basis for a birth plan, if you decide to create one.Read on to find out what typically happens at the hospital and what alternatives you may have. Not all the options will be available in every setting or make sense for your situation, especially if your pregnancy is high-risk. But this should give you a place to start your discussion.Then you can print our birth plan worksheet and use it to note your preferences.Get ready for laborPrint and fill out our birth plan worksheet.LaborWhen you arrive at the hospital, a nurse or doctor evaluates you to see how far your labor has progressed. You may be asked to walk around a bit or even to return home for a while before being admitted.Once you're admitted, the hospital may allow you to invite family and friends to be with you, bring in comfort objects (such as photographs, flowers, or pillows) or food and drink for your support team, play music, dim the lights, and move around as you need to for comfort. If you plan to have the birth photographed or filmed, ask ahead of time what the hospital's policy is. Not all hospitals allow it.Creating a calm and intimate delivery room (Advice from moms) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:58Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:58Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosTo allow you to move around as you choose during labor, most hospitals won't routinely start an IV when you're admitted. (You'll be encouraged to drink clear liquids to stay hydrated.)Most hospitals no longer order enemas or shave you before delivery.You may want to ask about the hospital's policy on fetal monitoring. Your baby will likely be monitored externally for 20 or 30 minutes when you're admitted. If your baby's heart rate is reassuring, you might only need to be intermittently monitored after that. Not being tied to a monitor allows you to move around more easily during labor. (And some hospitals have wireless monitors, so patients can walk around while being continuously monitored.)Discuss your preferences for pain management with your healthcare provider. If you're trying for an unmedicated birth, you might plan to work with a support team or use various labor props, such as a shower, tub, birthing ball, birthing stool, squatting bar, and so on. (You may want to ask your provider what kinds of props you're allowed to bring with you and which ones the hospital can provide.) If you prefer to use pain medication or have an epidural, it's a good idea to discuss your options ahead of time.If your labor stops progressing, your medical team may recommend interventions such as breaking your amniotic sac (if your water hasn't already broken) or augmenting your labor with Pitocin.When it's time to push, your medical team can coach you on when and how to bear down. Another option might be to follow your body's natural urges and push when and how you feel is right for you.You may be able to choose the position you deliver in, such as squatting, semi-sitting, lying on your side, or on your hands and knees.Most hospitals don't routinely perform episiotomies, so you probably won't need to communicate your preference. But be aware that your provider may recommend one in some situations.If an assisted delivery is required, your provider will use a vacuum device or forceps to help your baby out of the birth canal.If you end up having a c-section, it's likely that you'll be awake and your support person will be able stay with you. In rare cases, you'll need general anesthesia and your support person will be asked to wait outside the operating room.You may want to ask your practitioner if you can view your c-section delivery through a clear plastic drape or have the drape lowered and have your baby placed directly on your chest afterwards.After deliveryAfter a vaginal delivery, the baby is usually placed on you and covered with a warm blanket. You can let your provider know if you prefer to hold your baby skin to skin immediately after delivery or want your baby dried off or bathed first.Unless your baby needs special medical care, you can usually ask for all procedures and tests to be done while your baby is in the room with you. Some procedures (such as bathing and measuring) can be delayed for an hour to give you a chance to feed and bond with your baby. If your baby does need to be taken from your for special medical care, your partner or attendant can go with him.The umbilical cord is clamped in two places and cut between the two clamps. Let your provider know if your support person wants to cut the cord.You may want to ask your caregiver about delaying the clamping and cutting of the umbilical cord. Recent research shows that waiting a few minutes allows extra blood to flow from the placenta to the baby and reduces the risk of newborn anemia and iron deficiency.If you've chosen to bank your baby's cord blood, the blood will be collected at this time. (You'll need to arrange for the process well in advance.)Whether you choose to breastfeed or formula-feed, you can begin whenever you and your baby are ready. If you're nursing, let your medical team know if you'd like a lactation consultant to help you get started.Consider whether you want your baby to have a pacifier and let the hospital staff know your feelings.Most hospitals encourage you to be with your baby as much as possible during your stay. They tend to support ""rooming in""  rather than keeping the baby in the nursery  to promote bonding. Ask about your hospital's policy on this if you have any questions.

Saving for college: 529 plans,https://www.babycenter.com/0_saving-for-college-529-plans_1263733.bc,"What is a 529 college savings plan?A 529 college savings plan is a type of investment account that allows you to set aside money for your child's education and let it grow tax-free. The federal government won't tax your money when you take it out of the account, as long as it's used for higher education.Any family can contribute to a 529 account regardless of income, and there's a lifetime maximum contribution (the amount varies from state to state, ranging from $235,000 to $511,000). The best part: You can often start an account with as little as $25.You can use the money in a 529 plan at any accredited college or university in the country public or private, graduate or undergraduate. And it can be used for tuition, fees, room and board, books, supplies, and equipment.All 529 plans are administered by individual states, but if you live in New Jersey, for instance, that doesn't mean you have to invest in the New Jersey plan.You can choose any state plan that meets your needs. If you're not a resident, however, you may face higher commission rates and more limited investment options. And if you choose your own state's plan, you may enjoy state tax benefits.Advantages of a 529 college savings plan529 plans offer huge tax breaksYour money grows tax-free for as long as you keep it in the program. When you take the money out for educational purposes, you won't pay federal taxes on any part of it not on the principal or the earnings. Some states, such as South Dakota, will tax the earnings when you withdraw them, but most won't.For details on current state tax policies, see Saving for College's comparison chart of 529 plans.The money you put in a 529 account is considered a gift and, as such, qualifies for the annual $14,000 gift tax exclusion. That is, you can contribute up to $14,000 annually without incurring any gift tax. According to the gift tax law, you can contribute five years' worth of ""gifts"" in one year and not incur any gift tax as long as you don't contribute anything for the next four years.So if you had the money available now, for instance, you could contribute up to $70,000 this year ($140,000 if you're married) and let the interest on that money grow and grow. It's also a great way for grandparents to move money out of their estate quickly without incurring taxes.Keep in mind, however, that if you exceed the gift tax contribution limit in a given year, the excess money will be taxed at a rate of 20 to 50 percent, depending on how much you give. If you're considering this option, check with a financial advisor or tax professional first.Note: If you open a 529 account for yourself which is an option, if you plan to go back to school the gift limitations don't apply. That's because money you give to yourself isn't a gift as defined under our tax laws.You stay in control of the moneyWith a 529 plan, you decide when and how much money to withdraw from the account. Compare this to a custodial account, with which your child takes control of the money at the age of majority (which ranges from 18 to 21, depending on state law) and can use it for whatever he chooses.529 plans are very flexibleYou can open accounts for any number of people, regardless of age and regardless of their relationship to you. Some possibilities: Open one for each of your kids, or even for yourself, if you're thinking of going back to school. Grandparents can open accounts for any or all of their grandchildren. A friend or godparent can open one for your child.You can have each child's 529 in a different state if you want to diversify your portfolio. You can even open more than one account per child if you think your child's education expenses might exceed your contribution limit maybe he's on the joint M.D., J.D., MBA track. If your child decides not to go to school or doesn't use the full amount in the account, you can roll the funds over to someone else.Disadvantages of a 529 savings planYour investment options are limited to what's offered by the stateIn a state with three plans, for example, you may choose to put your money into a fund that's made up of all equity mutual funds, such as blue chip stocks and international stocks; a fund of all fixed income securities, such as the U.S. Bond Index fund and a money market account; or a fund of some combination of stocks and securities, depending on how much stock you'd like to hold. You can't, however, decide which blue chip stocks you might like to hold or decide which money market fund to invest in.Although some people may dislike this lack of freedom, many state plans are surprisingly strategic. For example, most states offer an opportunity to automatically alter the mix of stocks and bonds in your investment portfolio as your child approaches college age. When your child is younger, the portfolio is composed of more aggressive stocks, and every quarter the mix in the portfolio becomes more conservative until it's mostly composed of bonds.If you're the type of person who wants more control of your investments, you should consider a Coverdell account as well.If you don't use the money for school, you'll pay heavy penaltiesIf you take money out of a 529 plan for other than educational purposes, you'll be assessed a 10 percent penalty on the earnings, plus you'll have to pay federal taxes on the earnings. To top it off, some states slap on an additional 10 percent penalty for early withdrawal.How will a 529 plan affect my child's financial aid eligibility?The good news is that any money in a 529 account is considered an asset of the parents (or grandparents, or godparents  whoever opened the account), and not of the child. That means your child's eligibility for need-based financial aid will be less affected by a 529 plan than by any other type of asset or savings account. Most other college savings vehicles are considered the child's asset, and this weighs heavily against need-based financial aid eligibility.What's more, 529 plans generally have no effect on merit-based scholarships, so encourage your child to apply for as many as possible. Even in a best-case scenario in which your academic or athletic superstar qualifies for a full-tuition scholarship you'll have no worries about your 529 account. Any extra money you contributed that you don't need because your child received a merit-based scholarship goes back to you, penalty- and tax-free (although earnings may be taxed). Of course, these savings may also be used for education-related expenses.How do I choose a 529 plan?Since nearly every state now operates a 529 college savings plan and many have multiple investment options, choosing where to put your dollars can be daunting. To start getting a feel for what's out there, visit these websites that allow you to access each state's plans and provide a number of tools to help you figure out which plan is best for you.Savingforcollege.comCollege Savings Plans NetworkAs you evaluate each plan, keep the following in mind:Check your own state first. Many let you deduct part of your contributions from your state tax bill, which can save you a lot of money if you live in a state with high taxes.Analyze the investment returns. You can get investment return information from Savingforcollege.com or by calling the plan directly.Find out who runs the plan. Look for a fund group with a solid track record and a good lineup of funds. You can get more information on individual funds from Morningstar, an independent investment research firm in Chicago.Read the fine print and watch out for penalties and restrictions. Some 529 plans impose heavy penalties for withdrawing the money in the first three years. Some plans have age restrictions for instance, they require your child to be younger than 15 to open an account.Find out what the annual maintenance fees and sales commissions are on the plans you're considering. High fees could wipe out your earnings for the year. The prospectus for the account will contain this information.A word about the stock marketLike most savings plans that invest in the stock market, 529 plans are vulnerable to market fluctuations especially plans composed of growth-oriented mutual funds (funds with the riskiest stock holdings).Even the most recommended 529 plans have losses in a bear market. In fact, near the end of 2008, the stocks in 529 portfolios typically lost 40 percent of their value.If you're concerned about losing money in the stock market in the short run, consider investing all your 529 money in a conservative investment fund. Most states offer money market funds or government bond funds that are low-risk investments with typically low returns. If you become more optimistic about the stock market, you can change your investment choices, but most plans allow this only once a year.How do I set up a 529 plan?You can enroll online at either Savingforcollege.com or College Savings Plans Network. Or, if you're feeling overwhelmed by the amount of information available on 529 plans and having trouble settling on the right one for you, consider using a broker. Every major brokerage firm can set up an account for you, though not all brokers offer all 529 plans.If you go the broker route, ask about commissions. They can be high and, in some cases, even wipe out your earnings for the first year. Sales commissions for some state plans are as high as 5.75 percent.A family that invested $6,000 in a 529 plan with a 5.75 percent sales commission would pay $345 in sales charges. With a lower, more typical 3.5 percent sales charge, the family would pay only $210.Still, the service provided could be worth it to you. If the mountain of data on 529s is keeping you from opening an account, an investment of $200 to get started could pay for itself in no time.Show sources Hide sources http://www.savingforcollege.com/articles/heres-how-much-can-you-contribute-to-a-529-plan-in-2016-983"
Baby shower planning and etiquette,https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-shower-planning-and-etiquette_1642.bc,"Who should host the baby shower?It used to be considered bad manners for a family member to throw a shower because it might seem like you're asking for gifts. But these days, just about anything goes. Any relative, close friend, or close co-worker should feel perfectly okay about planning a baby shower.When should the baby shower be held?Most baby showers happen shortly before the baby is born, and a shower makes for a welcome diversion especially toward the end of pregnancy.When setting a date for the party, first consult the parents-to-be. It would be disappointing to plan a party and send out invitations, only to find out that the most important people have a schedule conflict. You also may have to accommodate the travel plans of grandparents, for example, even if they aren't the guests of honor.If you decide to throw a shower after the baby is born, that's fine too. And with a baby as the centerpiece, you'll have a surefire icebreaker and conversation topic.Who should be invited to the baby shower?If you're hosting the shower for a close friend, you may have some ideas about the guest list already. It's best to consult with the guest (or guests) of honor before finalizing your list, though. That way, you won't accidentally leave out someone important  or invite someone they would rather not include.If the parents-to-be have close friends and family who live far away and can't make it to the shower, consider setting up a time during the event when they can be included through FaceTime or Skype. Make sure they get an invitation with all the details! What about hosting a shower for the expectant momanddad?Although many baby showers still follow the ""women only"" tradition, baby showers for both women and menare also popular. Some dads even have their own baby shower. It all depends on what sort of gathering the expectant mom or parents prefer.Is it okay to throw a baby shower for a second child?Showers for a second or subsequent baby have become more common and are considered appropriate. Parents whose children have a large age gap may be especially appreciative. There's always reason to celebrate a new baby, whether it's a large or small affair.For parents who prefer a smaller event the next time around, consider throwing a ""baby sprinkle,"" which is a scaled-down version of a full shower. For example, the gathering could be an afternoon picnic or a simple pancake breakfast, with or without games. There may be only a small registry or no registry at all.Is a surprise baby shower a good idea?Think long and hard before choosing to throw a surprise party. If your guest of honor doesn't like surprises or was really hoping for a specific type of event, you could put her in an awkward position. On the other hand, if you let the future parents in on the arrangements, you can be confident that they'll be pleased with the outcome.What kind of invitations should I send?You can send invitations by mail or email, or by scheduling an event on social media.In addition to all the basic information (who, what, where, when, and RSVP instructions), it never hurts to let people know thethemeof the shower if there is one. If the expectant parents are registered anywhere for baby gear, it's fine to mention that too. (Or you can give guests the registry information when they RSVP.)When should I send the invitations?Send invitations early enough to give the guests four to six weeks' notice: That way everyone has enough time to put the shower on their calendar and shop for the perfectgift. What should we do at the baby shower?Keep your guest of honor's preferences in mind when it comes to activities. Some moms- and dads-to-be dislike shower games and would rather spend time socializing with guests. Asking about these kinds of things before you start planning ensures that the shower will be fun for everyone.There are many things to consider:You may want to select athemeto tie everything together. It's certainly not necessary, but it can help you make decisions about elements of the party, and it's often fun for guests.Plan to serve some type offood and refreshment, depending on the time of day, your budget, and how fancy (or informal) the shower will be.Some people like to playfun or silly baby shower games, but there are plenty of other festive activitiesto keep guests entertained.It's customary to givefavorsto everyone who attends the baby shower. Or you can offer prizes to the guests who win games instead.Aside from socializing and honoring the parents-to-be, the main event at a baby shower is often opening the gifts. If there's no registry and guests need help figuring out what to bring, have them check our list oftop baby shower giftsand our roundup ofreaders' favorite baby shower gifts.Show sources Hide sources The Emily Post Institute.

How to avoid making meals a power struggle (ages 2 to 4),https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-avoid-making-meals-a-power-struggle-ages-2-to-4_64322.bc,"How can I avoid arguing with my child over food at every meal?For many families, sitting down together for a meal often means fighting over food  what's on the menu, who's eating (or not eating) what and how much. But who wants that night after night?To avoid squabbles at supper, try not to talk about food at the table and simply serve the meal without comment. Make meals a stress-free time when you talk together about pleasant things.Of course, if your child is a picky eater, holding your tongue can require a lot of restraint. But your child will benefit in the long run if you don't harp on his eating habits throughout the meal.Nutritionists say it's your job to decide what, when, and where to eat, and it's your child's job to figure out the rest. Provide your child with reasonable, healthy food choices, but dont force him to eat. As difficult as it may be, its important to give your child some control  and you may be surprised to learn how good children can be at self-regulation when it comes to food.""It's your child's decision whether or not to eat, what to eat from what is being offered, and how much of it,"" says Nancy Hudson, a registered dietitian at the University of California at Davis.What if my child refuses to eat what I serve?Your mom may have rewarded you with a bowl of ice cream for cleaning your plate, but that just demonstrated that veggies were the punishment and dessert was the reward.Instead, try this approach: Serve at least one food you know your kid likes, don't discuss eating habits, and clear the table when the meal is over  even if your child doesn't eat all his food. Its okay if hes still hungry after dinner.Dont become a short-order cook, preparing special meals just to appease your child. And don't give snacks close to mealtime  your child is more likely to eat if hes hungry.If your child turns up his nose at a new food, don't be afraid to serve it again. Try cooking it a different way or serving it raw. Kids often need to be exposed to a new food several times before they learn to like it. Give it time and don't force it.If he wants dessert, give it to him without much fanfare, but consider serving fruit instead of a sugary treat. Treating dessert as a reward for finishing his vegetables risks teaching him that vegetables arent enjoyable. Offering more nutritious desserts along with occasional treats like ice cream encourages healthy habits.Its also important to be a good role model. If your child sees you enjoying your meals, hes more likely to enjoy his as well.How can I tell if my child is eating well enough?Remember that your child is the one in control of what he puts into his body. Deciding for your child when he's hungry or when he's had enough to eat ultimately does him a disservice: ""He won't learn to recognize when he's hungry and when he's done, and you're setting him up for eating problems later, such as obesity, overeating, or controlling food,"" says Hudson.""Children are amazingly good at self-regulation. They may eat almost nothing one day, and then the next day they eat a ton of food,"" Hudson says.If you watch what your child eats over the course of a week or a month, you'll see that he does a pretty good job of getting what he needs from different food groups (as long as you offer a variety).

Saving for college: Prepaid tuition plans,https://www.babycenter.com/0_saving-for-college-prepaid-tuition-plans_1278797.bc,"What is a prepaid tuition plan?Prepaid tuition plans are investment accounts that allow you to pay for your child's future college tuition (or a portion of it) at today's prices. If you have enough money now, you could pay for a complete four-year degree that your child won't use for another 18 years. Or, if your budget's more modest, you can prepay a portion of your child's college expenses.Some plans allow you to purchase individual tuition credits. Others let you buy a semester's or year's worth of tuition. Prepaid tuition plans are actually a variation on the popular 529 college savings plans, but they're virtually risk-free. For starters, you can't lose any of the money you invest in them.Prepaid tuition plans are administered by individual states, and most can only be redeemed at public colleges and universities in that state. In many cases, you or the student beneficiary of the account must also live in that state. About 19 states currently offer prepaid plans.Here's an example of how a prepaid account works: Say a state university requires about 400 tuition credits for a four-year bachelor's degree and the equivalent of another 400 credits for room and board, and each credit costs $78. That means that if you buy a package covering tuition, plus room and board today, you'll pay $62,400.It's a hefty tab, but compare it to the $128,000 bill you'd be paying in 15 years, when those credits will likely cost $160 each, according to current projections. You're looking at a savings of $65,600! From an investment perspective, that's a 4.9 percent rate of return  not great, compared with the enormous gains stock market investors enjoyed in the late '90s, but pretty darn good for an investment with no risks.Prepaid tuition plans have been around for about 20 years, but they've become more flexible in recent years. Many states are now paying minimal interest on prepaid contracts, which guarantees a return on your investment even if tuition rates don't go up. What if my child doesn't want to go to school in our home state or she gets into Princeton?Many state plans have made it easier to transfer the money in your account to private schools or public universities in other states if your child decides not to attend college in your home state. But keep in mind that the amount of money you invested for an in-state school probably won't cover tuition at a private or out-of-state school.In some states, if you cancel the prepaid contract, there's no penalty  just a fee of about $50 to $150. Other states assess a 10 percent penalty on earnings.To find out more about the rules for your state's plan, visit Mapping Your Future.Your prepaid options aren't limited to public universities. About 250 private schools have come together to form their own prepaid tuition plan called the Independent 529 Plan, which began in 2003. The tuition plan consortium includes Princeton, Stanford, MIT, Emory, Loyola, Notre Dame, Baylor, Amherst, and many other top-notch universities.If you purchase this plan, your child can use the tuition credits at any participating school. If your child decides not to go to one of these schools, the plan will give you a full refund with interest. This modest interest isn't taxed as long as you spend the money on higher education.For more information, check the FinAid.website.Advantages of a prepaid tuition planPrepaid tuition plans are a virtually risk-free way to pay for collegeIf you're worried about the stock market, a prepaid plan allows you to avoid market uncertainty. There's no way you can lose the money in your prepaid account. If you buy a year's worth of college today, you get a year's worth when you redeem the account.This is particularly appealing if you have a child who'll be attending college in the next four to five years. In that short time frame, you could experience zero growth in a stock market investment or even lose some money. With college tuitions rising fast (between 2006 and '07, tuition and fees rose 6.3 percent at four-year public colleges and 5.9 percent at four-year private colleges, according to the nonprofit College Board), paying for your child's schooling today almost guarantees substantial savings.Some prepaid tuition plans offer tax benefitsSome states also offer a state tax break for investing in a prepaid tuition plan. Plans based on bond funds may also offer federal tax benefits.Prepaid tuition plans don't affect financial aid eligibilityYour distributions to a prepaid tuition plan no longer affect your child's financial aid eligibility, thanks to the Higher Education Reconciliation Act of 2005. Just like a 529 college savings plan, prepaid tuition is treated as an asset of the owner  the parents. (Previously, the plan's value counted as a child's asset, reducing aid eligibility dollar for dollar.) That means these plans are now a good option for lower-income as well as middle-income families who may not have qualified for aid. Students with prepaid tuition plans are still eligible for merit scholarships that can help pay other school expenses Disadvantages of a prepaid tuition planYour child's college choices are limitedMost prepaid plans are designed for state residents for use at public colleges and universities within that state. Many do have cancellation or transfer policies, but the money you invest in the plan won't go as far at a private or out-of-state school because tuitions at those institutions are typically much higher than in-state universities.Prepaid accounts may limit your investment growth potentialAs with most low-risk investments, prepaid tuition plans have limited growth potential  most plans generally offer basic interest in the 4 to 5 percent range per year. If the stock market should rally and all your money is tied up in a prepaid tuition account, you'll miss out on potential investment income.Where can I find out more about prepaid tuition plans?The nonprofit Tuition Plan Consortium provides a list of private colleges that participate in the Independent 529 Plan.Savingforcollege.com offers lists of state prepaid tuition plans, as well as details about each state's plan.

How to plan a great Halloween party,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-plan-a-great-halloween-party_65107.bc,"With just a few tricks, you can treat your kids and their friends to a party they won't soon forget. Here are tips for creating a perfectly spooky setting, a menu of ghastly goodies, and plenty of mischievous merriment.Diabolical decorationsGauze ghostsWhether you use these mini apparitions as part of a table setting or line them up on a windowsill or countertop, they're guaranteed to get young party guests in the Halloween spirit. Make enough for everyone to take one home when the party's over.You'll need:A cookie sheetWax paperAluminum foil, cut into 6-by-8-inch rectanglesLiquid glue (such as Elmer's)Gauze, cut into 4-by-4-inch squares (or use precut 2-inch-square gauze bandages, unfolded)Line the cookie sheet with wax paper. Next, make forms for your mini-ghosts by crumpling the aluminum foil into conical, ghost-like shapes, with a round head and a flaring skirt. Space the forms evenly on the wax paper. In a bowl, mix together 1/2 cup of glue and 1/2 cup of water. One at a time, dip the pieces of gauze into the glue solution, then squeeze out most of the liquid and drape the gauze over a foil form, covering it completely. Let the ghosts air dry completely (two to four hours), then gently remove the foil forms from underneath the gauze. Using a black permanent marker, draw on circular eyes and open mouths.Dangling spidersWhen it comes to these decorative arachnids, the more the scarier! But have no fear  they're a cinch to make. And their lightweight balloon bodies make them ideal for hanging overhead. Just be sure to assemble them on the day of the party or the night before so the balloons don't have time to deflate.You'll need: 10-inch balloons (black is ideal, but any dark color will do)Black pipe cleanersStringFor each spider, inflate a balloon and tie it closed. Hold the balloon on its side  the inflated part will form the body, while the knot will be the head. For the legs, hold four black pipe cleaners in a bunch and, treating them as one, wrap the middle of the pipe cleaners tightly around the balloon neck, forming eight legs (four on each side). Next, separate the pipe cleaner ends and make two bends in each to create a knee joint and a foot. Lastly, tie a long piece of string around the knot where the legs are attached, and the spider's ready to hang. Frightening (but fantastic) foodBat ear chips and green slime dipPartygoers will go batty over this ""ear-ie"" appetizer: blue corn tortilla chips served with creamy guacamole. Don't forget to provide a serving spoon so kids can transfer helpings of ""green slime"" to their own plates before dipping in.More green slimeYou can't beat the simplicity of this delightfully goopy Halloween concoction. In a blender, mix together a few drops of green food coloring and a jarful of applesauce until super smooth and just the right shade of slime. Serve with graham crackers for dipping.Mummy munchiesMum's the word when it comes to the inspiration for this tasty finger food. Slice flour tortillas into 1/2-inch-wide strips. Then cut hot dogs into quarters lengthwise so they form long, thin strips. Wrap each hot dog piece in a tortilla strip, mummy-style, moistening the end of the strip with a drop of water to make it stick. Arrange the mummy munchies end-side-down on a nonstick cookie sheet and bake them at 425 degrees for five to seven minutes, until the edges of the tortilla strips are just starting to crisp. Allow the munchies to cool for a few minutes before serving, then set them out with a cup of ""blood"" (a.k.a. ketchup) for dipping.Jack-o'-lantern sandwichesYour little monsters will find these sweet-faced lanterns irresistible. Using a round cookie cutter, cut out circles from slices of white bread. Spread the cutouts with apricot or peach preserves, then place the ""pumpkins"" on individual plates. For stems, cut the leftover bread crusts into 1-inch lengths and place one at the top of each pumpkin. Use raisins or currants to give the orange globes eyes and grins. For a savory sandwich variation, cut slices of American cheese into small triangles and arrange them atop the bread circles to resemble a jack-o'-lantern's eyes, nose, and mouth.Eyeball cupcakesThese easy-to-make cupcakes will be gone in the wink of an eye. Simply spread a batch of cupcakes with white frosting. To create a colorful iris, gently press a Life Savers Gummie into the frosting in the center of each cupcake. Then, place a chocolate chip ""pupil,"" tip down, in the middle of the Gummie. As a finishing touch, use red decorator's gel to add squiggly lines for a bloodshot look.Marshmallow goblinsSoft and sweet, these tempting little ghosts are known to do quick disappearing acts. To whip up a batch, cover a flat surface with wax paper. Dust the paper with confectioner's sugar. One at a time, place a marshmallow on the sugared paper and cover it with another piece of wax paper. Use a rolling pin to flatten the marshmallow into a thin, irregular ghost shape. Remove the ghost from the paper and press two mini-chocolate chips, tips down, into the marshmallow to create eyes. Serve on a platter.Witch's brewKids will get a kick out of watching this colorful concoction foam and bubble into a tasty thirst quencher. Pour equal amounts of orange juice and ginger ale into a punch bowl ""cauldron."" Then drop generous scoops of lime sherbet into tall plastic tumblers and pour a ladle full of brew over each one. Serve at once. Ghoulish gamesMusical pumpkinsThis ramble through a paper pumpkin patch  a noncompetitive variation on musical chairs  is a great way to kick off the party activities. To set it up, cut out large pumpkin circles from orange poster board or construction paper; you'll need one per child. Randomly arrange the circles (spaced apart) on an open area of the floor. If possible, stick the pumpkins to the carpet or floor with rolled pieces of masking tape on the back. Now turn on the stereo and explain that as long as the music is playing, everyone should circle around and through the pumpkin patch. But as soon as the music stops, each child should sit on a pumpkin. The game continues in this manner, with no elimination, until the kids are ready to move on to another activity.Guess who's the ghostIn this disappearing game, one child is temporarily escorted out of the room. Meanwhile, another child covers herself in a plain white sheet (another option is to drape the sheet over a card table so the child can simply duck under it). When the first child is brought back into the room, he tries to guess which of the other guests is the ghost. Keep playing until everyone's had a chance to be the guesser and the ghost.Spooky (but sweet) scavenger huntIt wouldn't be Halloween without tricks and treats  and the trick here is finding the treats. There's a bonus, too: The kids get to collect their loot in a customized treat bag. In one room, spend a few minutes helping the kids turn paper lunch bags into colorful treat totes by having them draw designs with crayons or nontoxic colored markers. As they finish their drawings, fashion a handle for each tote by cutting a strip from a large grocery bag and stapling the ends in place. Meanwhile, have a helper hide soft wrapped candies, small boxes of raisins, and little party favors in another room. When everyone's ready, bring in the kids and let the scavenger hunt begin. One tip: Reserve a portion of the candy so you can supplement any treat bag that ends up a little short.Return to our Halloween guide."

LGBTQ parents: Talking to your family about your plans,https://www.babycenter.com/0_lgbtq-parents-talking-to-your-family-about-your-plans_10418543.bc,"The number of families with lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender parents is greater than ever before. But while the families that LGBTQ people create are increasingly accepted in the world at large, the families they come from might not be so welcoming.""Family relationships are difficult, even now,"" says Jeff Levin, a licensed clinical social worker at the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual & Transgender Community Center in New York City.""LGBT people who don't have supportive families sometimes question their own ability to become parents,"" says Levin. ""They don't know if they have the skills, the temperament, or the patience. And without their own family to back them up, they feel they're already at a disadvantage.""Struggles with family can range from outright rejection, where a family of origin simply won't accept their family member's sexuality, partner, or decision to become a parent, to more subtle tensions. For example, if one partner in a relationship is biologically related to a child via egg or sperm, sometimes relatives will treat that partner as the ""real"" parent. In her practice in Berkeley, California, psychotherapist Mary Bradford has heard of situations where family members ignore the partner, or won't use the parents' preferred terminology for their family. In one example, says Bradford, family members of a gay male couple who used one partner's sperm with a surrogate insisted on referring to the surrogate as the child's mother.But Bradford has also seen families become more accepting and loving. She cites the experience of one of her female clients, whose family rejected her when she married a woman and had a child. Despite open hostility, the woman stayed in contact, then began gently planning visits with the child. Eventually, her family members came around.And, Bradford says, never underestimate the power of a grandchild. ""Having grandchildren really warms people up. That's a bond, and an important one, and it does change minds and hearts.""If you're dealing with family who may not be supportive, there are some steps you can take to manage both the situation and your own expectations.Test the waters: Gauge how your family of origin feels about you becoming a parent. That helps you know how your child will be received and gives you some time to educate your relatives about LGBTQ families.Timing counts. If you're not sure how it will be received, don't drop your ""We're pregnant!"" announcement at your mother's 60th birthday party.If you have a close family member, share your plans with that person first. Then, if you anticipate an overall less-than-joyful reaction from your family to your news, strategize with your close ally and other helpful relatives so that when you do make your announcement, you won't feel alone.If you encounter antagonism or have an ongoing difficult relationship, you may be able to persuade family members to attend a meeting with an organization such as PFLAG, formerly known as Parents, Families and Friends of Lesbians and Gays, which has chapters around the country. Support staff at organizations like this can provide great perspective and mediate constructive dialogCome up with some tactful deflections for when people get a little too curious about how you're going to become a parent. If you don't want to get into the details of sperm donors, egg freezing, or adoption, a simple, ""We're working with some experts and we're really excited"" is enough.Give your relatives time, and persist in keeping a connection. If they live in a less-than-progressive community, they might never have thought about you having children, so it might take a while for them to come around.If your family can't be there for you, find allies where you can. Gay and straight friends, your own Facebook or WeChat group, online communities where you can vent freely  all can give you the emotional support you need.Show sources Hide sources PRRI. 2015.

Tax time: Flexible spending plans versus the childcare credit,https://www.babycenter.com/0_tax-time-flexible-spending-plans-versus-the-childcare-credit_3651253.bc,"Daycare and childcare payments can take a big bite out of your paycheck. That's especially painful in a tough economy, when we're all looking for ways to cut expenses. Fortunately, you can recoup some of the costs by either enrolling in a flexible spending account (FSA) or taking the childcare credit at tax time.To qualify for either an FSA or the childcare tax credit, both you and your spouse must have earned income. Exception: One of you was a full-time student for five months of the tax year.If you work for a company that offers an FSA, here's how to figure out which option is best for you. Either way, it's like getting a sale price on childcare  something that's virtually never marked down.The childcare flex accountA flexible spending account for dependent care is not something you can set up on your own, but many companies offer one to employees. This type of FSA allows you to put aside up to $5,000 ($2,500 for married individuals filing separate returns) before taxes to pay for dependent care expenses.The amount is deducted from your paycheck and then reimbursed to you for qualified expenses  money you paid for services that enable you to work, such as at-home care (a nanny or babysitter) and care outside the home (such as daycare or after-school care). Note: In most cases, to obtain FSA reimbursement you'll have to provide receipts for payment from, and a social security number or tax identification number for, every care provider, including nannies and other babysitters.Because this is a ""pretax"" deduction, you won't have to pay federal, social security, Medicare, or state taxes on the amount. Your contribution can't exceed the income of the spouse who earns the least. So, to set aside the full $5,000 each year, each parent must make at least that much.An FSA essentially serves as a tax deduction, reducing your adjusted gross income (AGI). This may allow you to have more itemized tax deductions for the year and increase the amount allowed for personal exemptions.Do think carefully about how much money to earmark for your FSA, though, because you forfeit any amount that isn't used during the calendar year. For example, if you sign up to have $3,000 put in your FSA and you only spend $2,000 on childcare that year, you'll lose $1,000. In other words, $3,000 will be taken out of your pay but only $2,000 will be reimbursed.The childcare tax creditThe IRS offers a 20 to 35 percent kickback on up to $3,000 ($6,000 if you have two or more kids) of qualifying childcare expenses you accrued in 2016. If your AGI is $15,000 a year or less, you get the full childcare tax credit; if it's more than $43,000, the figure drops to 20 percent. So if you earn $45,000 a year and spend $6,000 on childcare for two kids, the tax credit equals just $1,200.Qualified expenses are defined in the same way they are for FSAs. And as with an FSA, those expenses can't exceed the earned income of the spouse who earns less.The best choice for youDepending on your financial circumstances, you may be able to take advantage of both an FSA and the childcare credit  but you can't claim the same expenses for both. For most people, however, it'll make financial sense to choose one or the other.Generally, the more you earn, the more you'll benefit from an FSA, particularly if you're at or above the 25 percent federal tax bracket. Taxpayers in the 15 percent federal tax bracket who have only one child and have qualified expenses of at least $3,000 may be best off with the FSA, too.For example, a married couple filing a joint federal tax return with a taxable income of $80,000 will save federal taxes of $1,250 (25 percent of $5,000) if one parent contributes $5,000 to a dependent-care FSA account. In addition, social security taxes will be reduced by $310 and Medicare taxes by $72.50.Lower-income families usually get less value from an employer-sponsored FSA and fare better with the federal tax credit. Of course, if your employer doesn't offer an FSA for dependent care, you'll want to take the tax credit.Ultimately, you may need to run the numbers to see which option saves you the most money. A tax specialist can figure it out for you, or you can do the math yourself using an online tool. Search for ""dependent spending account calculator"" (or similar wording) to find one.Learn moreFor more information, consult an accountant or try these IRS links:Frequently asked questions about the childcare credit and flexible spending accounts for dependent careThe Child and Dependent Care CreditForm 2441, Child and Dependent Care Expenses"
Planning your preschooler's birthday party: Choosing a theme,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-preschoolers-birthday-party-choosing-a-theme_10348960.bc,"Throwing a party with a theme adds to the birthday fun. Plus, props signify that the party is something special, not just another playdate, and choosing a theme makes decorating easy.The inspirationMany preschoolers will have ideas for the theme, so enlist the birthday child's help. Book, TV, and movie characters are popular, and you can buy a decorating kit with cups, plates, napkins, and banners.Preschoolers especially love it when their cake is decorated with their favorite character. Thomas the Tank Engine, Elmo, Dora the Explorer, Disney princesses, Bob the Builder, Winnie the Pooh, and Mickey Mouse are all appropriate for this age group.Outside the boxYou can also think outside the box and come up with your own creative theme. Throw a morning pajama party: Whip up pancake batter, put out sleeping bags, and invite everyone to wear their PJs while you make breakfast for them. Or celebrate with a teddy bear party: Ask the guests to bring their bears and spread out a picnic on a blanket. (Reassure them that they get to take their bears home when they go!)If you're feeling brave, try a messy outdoor art fest where you put the kids in old T-shirts and let them go crazy with big sheets of paper and bottles of paint.Color me happyA color theme is ideal for this age, and as a bonus, a theme revolving around your child's favorite color is easy to execute. Pick up some pink balloons, pink M&Ms, and pink plates, and you're ready to go. You can also invite your guests to wear pink to the party."
Planning your preschooler's birthday party: Games and activities,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-preschoolers-birthday-party-games-and-activiti_10348962.bc,"Preschoolers are easily delighted and entertained  and they're experts at free play. Pass out bottles of bubbles, sticks of chalk, and some balls, give them a patch of grass to run around on, and they'll be happy.Preparation is keyBut it's fun to incorporate a few special activities at a party. For 3-year-olds, prepare three or four activities, and for a group of 4-year-olds, five to six  that way if one game is a flop you can quickly move on to the next one. It's hard to know how long an activity will capture children's attention, though they can often burn through one in five to ten minutes. Here are some ideas for activities.Mini MichelangeloThis is a great age for an uncomplicated art project. Make several colors of homemade playdough, then ask the kids to create mini birthday cakes. (Remind them that these pretend cakes aren't for eating!)Roll out a long piece of paper, write ""Happy Birthday"" across it, and the kids can decorate it with markers and stickers before you hang it up. Pass out crayons, paper, and cookie cutters, and show them how to trace around the shapes.Music timeMost children this age love action songs and hand rhymes. Try ""I'm a Little Teapot,"" ""The Hokey Pokey,"" ""If You're Happy and You Know It,"" ""Here We Go 'Round the Mulberry Bush,"" and ""Ring-Around-the-Rosy."" Go through the songs first, demonstrating the actions, and then sing together.Free to be you and meDon't expect all kids to participate in games. Some 3-year-olds will be more inclined to wander off and kick a ball or color. Put out some picture books, trains, simple puzzles, and a dress-up box to keep them occupied.If you're hosting a party at the park, the play equipment will engage the kids, but you'll create a more memorable experience by incorporating a few activities. Play Follow the Leader or Hide and Seek. Invite everyone to bring their tricycles, kites, or buckets and shovels.Let me entertain youWhat about formal entertainment? If you're expecting a big group of guests or hope to chat with other parents, you could consider hiring an entertainer to keep the kids enthralled. Just bear in mind that some preschoolers find a clown funny while others will be frightened and reduced to tears.Costumes  even if it's Elmo  are typically what scare this age group. The kids will be most comfortable with someone who isn't heavily disguised with a mask or face paint and who will simply sing songs and dance with them.Bounce house?Preschoolers love bounce houses, but often their judgment hasn't caught up with their physical ability and they're likely to take too many risks. The last thing you need is a kid with a broken arm. So, if you do rent a bounce house, be sure to always have at least two adults supervising."
Planning your preschooler's birthday party: Goody bags,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-preschoolers-birthday-party-goody-bags_10348963.bc,"At this age, your young guests probably won't notice if you skip the party favors. If you do choose to buy them, steer clear of candy and small toys that kids can choke on.Less is moreConsider giving each child one nice item that will last awhile rather than many little things that will clutter up your guests' homes and likely end up broken. They don't have to cost much. You could give the kids a pair of fun socks, a stuffed animal, a sheet of stickers, a box of crayons, a bucket and shovel, a novelty bath sponge, a bike bell, or a paperback book.On a budget? You can make your own playdough and pass it out in plastic bags tied with colorful ribbon. Or bake dough ornaments using cookie cutters tied to the party theme  whether it's dinosaurs or cats or fairies.Double dutySippy cups also work well because kids can use them at the party and then take them home. Just be sure to write the children's names on them.Book wormsSome families do a book swap instead of goody bags or presents: Each child wraps and brings a book to the party and at the end everyone opens a book to take with them.Hide and seekBe sure to put the goody bags out of reach so little hands don't get into them before the party's end. But stash them in a place where you can see them or else you might forget to pass them out."
Planning your preschooler's birthday party: Presents,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-preschoolers-birthday-party-presents_10348964.bc,"Presents are lots of fun for preschoolers, but a huge pile of them opened all at once can be overwhelming. Also, kids this age  especially 3-year-olds  are likely to snatch gifts from the guest of honor, and this can lead to trouble.The gift that keeps on givingUnless a guest requests that your child open a gift at the party, some parents choose to leave the present unwrapping for afterward. More and more, this is considered a socially acceptable option, especially for very young kids who easily melt down during gift opening. You might spread the process out over a week so your child opens one gift a day  especially if you throw a big party and are left with a mountain of presents.One more tip: Put the presents in a place that's out of the children's reach.To gift or not to giftSome families are experimenting with gift-free birthday parties, suggesting that guests bring handmade cards instead of toys. Some families do a book swap at the party instead of presents: Each child wraps and brings a book, and at the end, each kid gets a book to take home. This is one easy way to take care of the presents and goody bags in one fell swoop.Giving thanksBe sure to send out thank-you notes. A cute and simple option is to take a photo of your child with all his new presents, print it out, and then mail or email it to all the guests. If you're sending them by mail, you can involve your child in the process by allowing him to decorate the thank-yous with stickers."
Planning your child's fifth birthday party: Presents,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-fifth-birthday-party-presents_10349556.bc,"Planning your child's fifth birthday party: Birthday presentsFor most 5-year-olds, a birthday party is about presents first  and then friends, cake, and games. Kids this age often talk for weeks beforehand about what toys they hope their friends will give them. It's not uncommon for the birthday kid to tell his friends what he wants.Your job is to make sure the excitement around presents doesn't get out of hand. Before your guests arrive, you should come up with a plan. Where will guests put the presents when they arrive? It's best to designate a place that's out of reach of little hands.Timing's everythingWhen should your child unwrap gifts? These days, it's not uncommon for families of 5-year-olds to put off the present opening until after the party. Many 5-year-olds are territorial about their stuff, and some parents don't want to deal with eight kids all fighting to play with the same shiny new race car. Plus, if you're hosting a crowd, you might decide your guests can't sit still long enough to watch your child open 15 or 20 gifts. If you're holding the event at a party place outside the home, a tight schedule might not allow for presents.Then again, guests enjoy watching a child open his birthday presents, and it's a good chance to teach your child gift-receiving etiquette. Before the party, talk to your child about saying thank you  even for things he doesn't like or already has.Early in the party, as guests are arriving, can be a great time for gifts at this age. This way, your child isn't nagging you to open presents throughout the entire party and he can move on to enjoying his time with his friends.After the presents are unwrapped, you can put the new toys away until after the party. With luck, your child will agree to this without any fuss, because he'll be excited to play with his friends. Another popular time for gifts is after cake. Whatever you plan to do, be sure to tell your child ahead of time.To gift or not to giftSome families choose to have a no-presents party, thinking that it's easier on everyone, that it reduces the clutter in their home, and that it's better for the environment.Giving thanksMailing thank-you notes after the party is standard, and if you involve your child in the process you can begin to teach him how to properly thank friends. One fun option is to have your child pose for a photo with all of his new toys and then use it as a thank-you card. Is it acceptable to simply email the photo and send a digital thank-you? That's debatable. Some might say it's inconsiderate and lazy, while others would say that you're saving trees. It's your call!"
Planning your child's sixth birthday party: Presents,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-sixth-birthday-party-presents_10349570.bc,"Six-year-olds are fully tuned into the idea that they'll be getting birthday presents at their party. They like to get stuff and they have preferences for brands and types of toys. Kids this age are likely to get more excited about the plastic superhero figurine from a friend than the beautiful cake baked by mom.Before the party, you'll want to designate a spot for gifts  ideally one that's out of reach of little hands. You'll also need to decide when to open presents.Timing's everythingIt's become more and more common for families to decide that it's easiest to open presents after the party, for two reasons: You avoid conflicts between children fighting over the new toys, and your guests don't have to sit still through a long gift-opening session. If you're holding the event at a party place outside the home, you might be on a tight schedule that doesn't even allow time for presents.But if you're expecting a small group, opening presents at the party is a great option. The kids who picked out specific gifts for your child will enjoy watching their present being opened. Plus, unwrapping presents in front of others is a good opportunity for your child to learn gift etiquette. Before the party, talk to your child about saying ""thank you"" after opening each gift. Explain that it will make the gift giver feel sad if he says ""I don't like this!"" or ""I already have this!"" By age 6, most kids will be responsive to this lesson.Some families do presents one by one as guests arrive. This way your child isn't nagging you to open presents throughout the entire party and he can move on to enjoying his friends. After the presents are unwrapped, you can put the new toys away until after the party. With luck, your child will agree to this without any fuss because he'll be excited to play with his friends.Another option is to open the presents after cake, just before the guests leave. If one of your guests can't stick around for the gift opening, they're free to go. Whatever you plan to do, be sure to tell your child ahead of time.To prevent a free-for-all, hand gifts to your child one at a time. One idea for solving the ""Open mine first!"" dilemma: As kids arrive, have them pull a number out of a bowl and tape it on their present. Later, gifts are opened in numerical order.To gift or not to giftSome families choose to have a ""no presents"" party, arguing that it reduces clutter in their house, is better for the environment, and makes things simpler for everyone.Giving thanksAt this age, your child is ready to take on some responsibility for sending thank-you notes. It's important to reinforce that thank-you notes are the rule for birthdays and holidays, so try to build time for it into the week following the party. One easy approach is to print out a card and have your child decorate each one with markers and stickers and then sign her name.Strapped for time? Some parents write generic thank-you cards before the party and put them in guests' goody bags. Other families send out thank-you emails in lieu of paper cards. Is this acceptable? That's debatable. Some might say it's inconsiderate and lazy; others would say that you're saving trees."
Plan B -- a single mom's decision to go it alone,https://www.babycenter.com/0_plan-b-a-single-moms-decision-to-go-it-alone_1482474.bc,"I'm in my ob-gyn's office, feet in the stirrups. Dr. Bakas peeks up over the paper sheet draped across my knees and pulls his gloves off with a snap. ""So? Do you want a cigarette?""My friend Bev laughs, as does the nurse, but I try not to because I don't want to jiggle or move or do anything to disrupt those tiny little sperm as they make the long journey up through my uterus to my little waiting egg.They've already had to do a lot of traveling. I bought them from the Scandinavian Cryobank, which shipped them from Denmark. They're from Olaf (not his real name), who's 22 and blond, blue-eyed, and tall.Olaf (well, his sperm) arrived packed in dry ice a week before I ovulated, so he hung around with me as we waited. He became my dinner companion. I set him up in his large round container on the chair across the table from me. I told him about my day.A part of me thought it'd be lovely to not have to drink both glasses of wine  and he could have done more than just agree with me all the time. But then I took him into the living room to watch TV, and he didn't complain when I kept changing the channel. We became pals, Olaf and I. We took pictures.Dr. Bakas hasn't done this before, though he did see the procedure when he was a resident. It's nothing, he said to me when I first talked to him about artificial insemination. We can absolutely do it here.So now the deed is done. Intrauterine insemination. It has a higher success rate than the vaginal insemination I could have done myself at home. And I'll take any advantage I can get.""If it's going to happen, it's happening right now, so just lie here for ten minutes. Let the magic begin,"" Dr. Bakas says, nodding as he and the nurse leave. Bev and I look at each other. Yes, I think, I'm getting pregnant right now.(I don't know where I got off thinking that way. I knew even then that my chance of getting pregnant through artificial insemination was only 5 to 25 percent per try.)I'm so excited it's hard to remember how reluctant I was about all this.For years I had stuck faithfully to another plan.The PlanThe Plan: Live life. Get married. Have kids. (I was hoping for two, but could have been talked into one or five or 20.)In grad school at 36, I thought, This is good! But where's the rest? The men? The dating?At 37, graduated, I turned to my friend Rebecca and said, That's it. I'm getting married.She had found a wonderful husband by combining hard work, sheer determination, and a little luck. So I did what she did: Yahoo, Match, Nerve. Never mind that I'm shyer than Rebecca, and not nearly so slender, and I don't have her brilliant red hair. Still, I dated up a storm at 37 and 38. I met many nice men. And at 38 I began to settle in with Juan, a screenwriter who was between jobs.He wanted kids, too  though it became more and more clear that he wanted them later, after he hit it big. I pulled out a BabyGap ad for strength, put it on the floor beside me and told him: We need to break up.And then one day, watching the high school students in the summer program I run, I thought back to being 16. And I realized, holy smokes, I'm Thirty-Nine and One Half years old.The kids went back inside to their classes, but I stayed in the sun and twisted a lock of hair around and around my finger. Well, I thought, I haven't asked Steve out yet. I could ask if he wants to go for a drink sometime. I also have a date coming up next week with a friend of a friend of a friend. It's not so bad. Don't panic.But I was panicking. Because it struck me that even if I did fall in love right then, say with Steve (or the guy next week, it didn't matter), and he fell in love with me, we'd have to wait a year or so to get engaged and then a year to plan the wedding and then, well, he wouldn't be ready to have kids right away...I mean, jeez, I'd be 50 before we could even try for a baby.I'm going to be alone, single, and childless for the rest of my life, I thought. This isn't the life I imagined when I was 16, sitting around listening to Love, soft as an easy chair and reading those romance novels, one after another.He was supposed to have rescued me by now. He was supposed to have surrendered to my feminine wiles long ago: my doe eyes, my blonde tresses.I stood up, fluffed my tresses, and faced the facts with my doe eyes.He isn't coming.I am absolutely on my own.I'd suspected this to be my fate even as I dreamed of the other, more romantic life. When I was a teenager my parents said, ""You'd better lose that weight or you're not going to find a boyfriend."" And embedded in this warning was the fate-worse-than-death scenario that my mother's sister was living: 40, single, childless.They shook their heads with pity. Poor Aunty Hanne.I felt it like a curse on my head. Be thin! Or die alone!Somewhere deep inside me I knew I'd be there, at the threshold of 40 and alone. I just knew it. And I swore as I watched Hanne get older and older that no matter what, I wouldn't miss out on having a child. Even if I had to go to some random bar and leave with a random guy and ravish him in some random motel. Then disappear.Plan BIt'd be more dramatic to say that I immediately got on the phone, ordered some sperm, and got on with it. But it took another several months to officially move from The Plan to Plan B. Most especially there was the deep, hollow sadness to be worked through in watching The Plan fail.Then, of course, there were things like money to be considered. And Rebecca helped me with a dirty little secret fear: Up until then it'd been hard to find a man ...but with a kid in tow, would it be impossible?Come on, she said. It's not like the old days. Look around you: Over 40, single with a baby, is hardly shocking. Just move on with your life. Do what you want. You have the rest of your life to find a man. This you have to do right now.Eventually I understood. I am absolutely on my own...for now.At the doctor's office, after I keep still for ten minutes, Dr. Bakas lets us go. At home I lie on the couch beneath my front room window. The couch where Olaf's sperm lounged for most of the seven days they were with me. I prop my butt up a little and focus on getting pregnant, just in case Dr. Bakas isn't right about the instantaneousness of insemination.Two days later, while I'm visiting a friend, waves of dizziness almost knock me over. There's a strange pinging deep in my pelvis and  most strangely  an awful metallic taste in my mouth. I know I'm pregnant. I just know I am. It may not stick, but at this moment, I know I am.It does stick, and my daughter Kaj arrives nine months later, one day after her due date. My miracle first-try baby. Meant to be, my mother says.Kaj is long and thin  8 pounds, 9 ounces. She's yanked out of me after 35 hours of labor and a near cesarean (which was most definitely not part of The Plan or even Plan B). But I can tell you this for sure: Epidurals are the miracle of the 20th century, and I have the best obstetrician in the entire world."

Planning your preschooler's birthday party: What your child is ready for,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-preschoolers-birthday-party-what-your-child-is_10348957.bc,"Keep it simpleBut before you put down a deposit on a bounce house and a clown, keep in mind that a simple party is often more fun for kids this age. A big birthday bash can overwhelm 3- and 4-year-olds and leave their parents exhausted. Preschoolers' expectations are low, and they tend to accept uncritically whatever food you serve and favors you hand out. They're perfectly happy with a relaxed party with snacks, cake, and one special element, like an art project.Go with the flowThat said, a big shindig might be more fun if you have a large extended family or live in a neighborhood full of kids. The secret to planning for a large group is to create a low-key, low-pressure atmosphere. If you throw a basic backyard bash or a party at the park that's easy to plan and execute, you'll be relaxed and your child will feel at ease and be less likely to dissolve into a puddle of tears before cake time.Be presentYou can also help the birthday child get through the day by insisting on an early bedtime the night before. Make sure to give lots of hugs and kisses throughout your child's birthday. The most important thing is for you to be there with plenty of love and attention, rather than getting distracted with tending to your guests.Start a traditionIf you haven't already incorporated a tradition into your child's birthday, this is a good time to start one. A tradition can be as simple as special candleholders you put on the cake every year or a hat your child always wears at cake time. Or maybe at the end of every year's party, you put on your child's favorite music and everyone boogies (a great opportunity for shooting video!). Traditions make the day more meaningful and incorporate a familiar element into an event that's bound to be a bit overwhelming."
Planning your child's fifth birthday party: What he's ready for,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-fifth-birthday-party-what-hes-ready-for_10349533.bc,"A 5-year-old looks forward to a birthday for weeks. He knows the day of his actual birthday  and the day of his party, if it's different. He knows what theme he wants. He might know what friends he wants to invite (though this list can change daily). He may enjoy talking nonstop about the party plans.Mini party plannerYou can encourage your child's enthusiasm by involving him in the planning. Give him a project, like coloring the invitations. You can also use his keen interest as an opportunity to talk about party etiquette. Tell him that it's nice to greet guests at the door and thank them for coming when they leave. Your child will likely listen and follow through, because the typical 5-year-old wants to please.But it's also important to know that your child's enthusiasm for his birthday can trick you into believing he's ready for a big bash. Five-year-olds are known for giving off the impression that they're self-contained and capable  but they can actually be quite intimidated in unfamiliar situations. Developmental psychologists often point to 5 as an age when children are more withdrawn, while 4 and 6 are more outgoing ages.Location, location, locationAn at-home party  something you have probably done before  might be the best fit for your 5-year-old. But it all depends on your child. For some energetic, rambunctious 5-year-olds, this is a great age to head to a party place where an instructor leads the kids through activities. But hosting the neighborhood kids at a local park can be just as fun  especially since you can be fearless about taking on all kinds of messy projects, like decorate-your-own cupcakes and chocolate-pudding finger painting. If you live near the coast, the beach is a great option because kids can build sand castles and hunt for shells and driftwood.Follow the leaderWhatever you plan, keep in mind that the kids will probably need you to lead them through activities  5-year-olds are typically in preschool and used to looking to an adult for guidance when engaging with a group of kids. This is a compliant age that responds well to direction."
Planning your child's fifth birthday party: The invite list,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-fifth-birthday-party-the-invite-list_10349535.bc,"Crowd controlMany kids are in preschool when they turn 5  a few are already in kindergarten  and you might be tempted to invite the entire class. It's thoughtful and generous to include all the kids so nobody ends up feeling left out. (Some schools have a policy against handing out party invites at school unless everyone's invited.)These big all-inclusive shindigs can be great fun  especially if you enlist the help of friends and family or if you hold the event at a party place where everything is taken care of. But before you start to plan for a crowd, make sure that you and your child are up for this  and realize you have alternatives. Your party will be more manageable and your little one will likely behave better if you restrict your list to six to eight kids.Revolving friendsKeep in mind that 5-year-olds  especially those who are settling into a new school for kindergarten or who are in preschool for the first time  change friends regularly. One day Olivia is your child's best friend and the next day you'll hear that Olivia rejected your child on the playground.You definitely should ask your child which children she wants to invite, but be prepared for her to change her mind every few days. For this reason, you might consider sending invites out as late as possible. Once the guest list is finalized and the invites are out the door, let your kid know that she can't change her mind.Meet the parents?Should you include the parents at this age? Five-year-olds are right at the cusp of being ready for a drop-off party. It really depends on the children you're inviting and how well they know you. At this age, it can be best to leave it up to each parent whether or not to stay.Small outingOne low-key alternative is to take your child plus one or two friends on a fun outing: pizza and a movie, a picnic and the zoo. This is an especially good approach if your kid is one of the many who has become surprisingly solitary, antisocial, and overwhelmed by large groups as she approaches this birthday milestone. While 4 and 6 are ages when most kids are outgoing and meet new situations with enthusiasm, 5-year-olds can be withdrawn and easily intimidated. It will be better for everyone if you plan a birthday celebration that's suited to your child's current temperament.Crafty invitesYour 5-year-old will probably enjoy helping with the invitations. She could draw a picture that ties into the theme, then you could make photocopies or scan it on the computer to make invites. Many 5-year-olds can write their friends' names on the envelopes. Even if she only does two or three, it will give her a sense of pride. If you don't have time to make invites, you and your child can shop for cards or pick a design for an email invitation together."
Planning your child's fifth birthday party: Choosing a theme,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-fifth-birthday-party-choosing-a-theme_10349537.bc,"The inspirationFive-year-olds love to have their passions incorporated into a party: ballerinas, pirates, Batman, Cinderella, SpongeBob. This makes it easier to plan  themed plates, napkins, cake decorations, and party favors are readily available online and at party supply stores. And kids go nuts for anything that's emblazoned with their favorite character.But you could also steer your child toward his more distinctive interests. Maybe he loves to help you tend plants in the backyard  you could throw a garden party. The guests could make tissue paper flowers, plant bulbs in small pots to take home, and snack on garden-fresh veggies. Or your child might be crazy about camping  you could pitch a few tents in the yard or at the park and serve hot dogs and s'mores. You can host a tea party and invite guests to bring their dolls or stuffed animals.Crazy for costumesChildren this age love to dress up. You could suggest that they come as kings and queens or their favorite superhero. It's also fun to help the kids make their own costumes at the party. At a cat party, you could make masks with whiskers and ears from construction paper, or for a pirate party you can help the kids create hats and eye patches out of construction paper and then swords from cardboard covered with foil.Do-it-yourself decorationsYou can try making some decorations yourself, with your child as your assistant. Mobiles, paper chains, and balloons with funny faces are all easy to do. There's a lot you can make with old cardboard boxes: a rocket ship for a space party, a mini house for a doll party, or a treasure chest for a pirate fest. You can tape boxes together to form the rocket, house, or chest ahead of time, and the kids can decorate it at the party. No time or money for fancy decorations? Concentrate on making the table look nice with colorful napkins, fresh flowers picked from your yard, and maybe a few of your child's toys that tie into the theme."
Planning your child's fifth birthday party: Games and activities,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-fifth-birthday-party-games-and-activiti_10349546.bc,"Be preparedWith 5-year-olds, your party will go more smoothly if you have what may seem like a ridiculous number of games prepared  10 to 12. The kids may run through them more quickly than you expect, or one or two may flop. You'll want to be organized because kids this age are in preschool and look to adults for instruction when they're in big groups. If there's a lull between games, you might be faced with a group of kids screaming, ""What should we do?"" or even worse, ""This party is boring!""Warm them upFives can be slow to warm up to a new situation. And they can also be solitary  especially when they're feeling shy. As guests trickle in, start with a few quiet activities that keep everyone busy doing the same thing but that don't require them to cooperate. Something hands-on like making things with pipe cleaners or clay might be a way to warm up. Once everyone has arrived, you could pull the kids together and read the birthday kid's favorite book or a story that ties in with your theme. (Choose the book before the party!)Let the games beginAfter the kids seem comfortable, start with some interactive games. (Kids this age usually aren't ready for team games.) You can rename the classics to fit your theme: Pin the Patch on the Pirate, Musical Beach Towels, The Queen Says. It's fun to create your own ""feely bags"" filled with dried beans, pennies, bars of soap  and then pass them around the circle and let kids guess what's in them. You can play some music and do a birthday march through the house. Pass out musical instruments and sing a song.Tucker them outWhile 5-year-olds might start off quiet and composed, they will quickly become restless and be ready for high-energy play. Try Red Light/Green Light, Follow the Leader, Leap Frog, Mother May I?, and Hide and Seek. Simply running amok on the lawn can help burn off some energy  though an adult might need to get this started.Get some helpTo make it easier on yourself, you could hire an entertainer. Kids this age will do best with someone who has a mix of tricks up his sleeve: a puppet show, face painting, and balloon animals. Five-year-olds are more comfortable than younger kids with characters in costume  many will have visited theme parks where they took a picture with Mickey Mouse or Snoopy  but it's safer at this age to stick with an entertainer who isn't disguised by a mask or heavy makeup.On a tight budget? Tap your friends or the parents of your party guests to see if they can do face painting, or play the guitar and lead the kids in song."
Planning your child's fifth birthday party: Goody bags,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-fifth-birthday-party-goody-bags_10349548.bc,"You're not obligated to pass out goody bags. But most 5-year-olds will have been to parties where this is the norm, so if you don't your guests will probably notice and a few might say something.Bags full of trinkets are common, and 5-year-old partygoers love lots of loot  but there are more environmentally friendly alternatives that send your guests home with less clutter. Consider writing the children's names on their party favors. Kids this age can become upset if they think their things are getting lost or mixed up.InspirationA good place to start is your theme. Can you come up with a favor that ties into it? If you host a garden party, send home bulbs that the children can plant. For a butterfly fest, wrap a packet of flower seeds, a few gummy worms, and a butterfly sticker in netting. Art party? A small watercolor set or a coloring book and box of crayons will certainly get used.Double dutyAnother great option is to do a craft project with the kids and make that the going-home gift. Kids this age are capable of taking on more complex projects. For a princess party, you can cut out crowns from construction paper or craft foam and then the kids can glue on fake gems. Or how about making kites from paper plates at a kite-flying party?Photo opAnother possibility: The kids can decorate photo frames made from squares of card stock with a 4-by-6-inch hole cut into the center. Then you can take a photo of all the party guests or of each child with the birthday kid and print it immediately (if you have a digital camera kit equipped to do so) or send the photo in a thank-you note.Book wormsSome parents do a book swap instead of party favors (and sometimes in lieu of gifts, too). Each child wraps and brings a book, and at the end of the party, each kid gets to open a book to take home."
Planning your child's sixth birthday party: What he’s ready for,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-sixth-birthday-party-what-he-8217-s-rea_10349562.bc,"Birthday highsIt's a classic trait of 6-year-olds to want to go first, to be loved the most, and to receive the most of everything. At this age, a birthday party is thrilling because it puts the birthday child at the center of attention. Six-year-olds get very excited as their party draws near and love joining in the planning - making invitations, helping to bake a cake, and choosing party favors.Birthday lowsBut while 6-year-olds thrive in the period leading up to the party, they sometimes struggle on the actual day. They might burst into tears or storm off in anger when they find themselves competing with a group of exuberant kids jockeying for the biggest piece of cake, grabbing at piata candy, or trying to jump the highest in the bounce house.Everyone's a winnerThis might sound like a nightmare, but actually it's quite easy to keep everyone happy if you think ahead. Play games that allow everyone to win, frost all the cupcakes with the same color of icing, and pass out favors that are identical.Grown-up grade-schoolerThis is the first year when you can safely plan a drop-off party, because most 6-year-olds separate easily from their parents. You can also lead the kids in more complicated art projects than in past years and feed them a wider variety of foods.Six is a great year to meet up at a party place where staff will lead the children in games and songs. This works great for 6-year-olds, who tend to listen to their teachers but resist their parents. If you host the party at home, the secret to success is a well-planned mix of games, art projects, and free play."
Planning your child's sixth birthday party: The invite list,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-sixth-birthday-party-the-invite-list_10349563.bc,"Big bashMost kids are in kindergarten when they turn 6. If you're ever going to host the entire class at a party, this might be the year to do it. In kindergarten, children's relationships aren't fully established, so your child might not have an obvious circle of friends to invite. Also, friendships are stormy, so the list of close buddies frequently changes. Sometimes it's easier to include everyone rather than deal with your child's ever-changing roster of friends. Plus, big parties can be a lot of fun, especially if you have extra adults on hand to help or if you can hold the event at a party place where the staff runs the show.A more low-key option is to bring treats to school and celebrate your child's birthday in the classroom. Ask the teacher if this is allowed and if there are any rules or restrictions  some schools might not allow sugary treats. Also, the teacher can tell you about any allergies students have. If you'd like, you can also talk to the teacher about incorporating an art project or other activity into the classroom celebration. The kids might like making your child birthday cards with paper and stickers you bring.Twice the fun, half the priceOne great idea to help cut the costs and workload for a large party is to find a partner in the kindergarten class  another family with a child who has a birthday near your child's. By hosting the party together, you can split expenses and responsibilities.Small shindigOf course, a small at-home party with five or six guests is a relaxed and comfortable option, and one that children this age  especially if they're shy  will still enjoy. If you live on a street full of kids, you could just invite the neighborhood gang to the party.If you decide to invite only a few students from your child's class, it's good to know that kindergartners are chatterboxes, and the news of a birthday party spreads fast. To avoid hurting the feelings of those who aren't invited, it's better not to pass out invitations in class (this is often forbidden by school policy for this reason). Instead, you can mail invites or send out an email.Meet the parents?Should the guests' parents stick around for the party? Six-year-olds are often at their worst with their own mothers and fathers, so the party might go more smoothly if parents just drop their kids off. Most kids this age separate fine from their parents, but if any have anxiety about being dropped off, then invite the parent to stay. You can always use an extra helper!"
Planning your child's sixth birthday party: Choosing a theme,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-sixth-birthday-party-choosing-a-theme_10349565.bc,"Get inspiredThemes that tie into a TV or movie character are big hits with many 6-year-olds and simplify the planning for you. You can buy a decorating kit with cups, plates, napkins, and banners emblazoned with your child's favorite  whether that's Buzz Lightyear, Hello Kitty, Word Girl, Tiana, or Superman.But you can also come up with a theme by looking at your child's more unique interests  such as painting, cooking, or kittens  and spinning one of them into a party. No matter what theme you and your child decide on, you can tap into her imagination to help bring it alive. Six-year-olds are masters at thinking outside the box and your child will be your best source of creative ideas.Have a tea partyYou and your child might have lots of fun brainstorming ideas for an Alice in Wonderland theme, for example. Put out snacks labeled ""eat me"" and ""drink me,"" play Pin the Smile on the Cheshire Cat, decorate Mad Hatter hats, and plant little flowers in pots that the kids can take home.Follow the yellow brick roadFor a Wizard of Oz party, you can hang a crepe-paper rainbow from the ceiling, create a yellow brick road with a roll of paper, put a pair of red shoes on the birthday girl, make a lollipop tree out of cardboard (when the guests leave, they can pick one).Love Legos?Or how about a Lego fest? The kids can get creative with heaps of blocks spread across the floor, build cars to race down a ramp, and guess how many Legos you put in a clear glass jar. You can even make a Lego cake by baking a rectangular sheet cake, topping it with eight cupcakes, and then frosting it with icing in a bright primary color.Get creativeSix-year-olds love painting and drawing, so your guests might like an art fair where you give them a quick art class and then set them free to create something. While everyone is eating cake, you can put the artwork on display and give each one an award or certificate. When the parents come to pick up their kids, they can browse the gallery."
Planning your child's sixth birthday party: Games and activities,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-sixth-birthday-party-games-and-activiti_10349567.bc,"Be preparedThe key to a successful 6-year-old birthday party is a well-planned mix of games, activities, and free time. You probably need about eight to ten games, which may sound like a lot, but your guests might run through them more quickly than expected or one or two could flop. Children will likely spend five or ten minutes with a simple game, but they'll sometimes become absorbed in an art project for 15 to 20 minutes.As guests trickle in, it works well to start off with an activity they can do individually. One good option is to spread out art supplies on a table, because 6-year-olds love cutting, pasting, coloring, and painting.Let the games beginAfter everyone arrives, you can move into games. Six-year-olds aren't emotionally well suited to competitive games since they often can't bear to lose. They're known for cheating and trying to change the rules, and if that doesn't work, dissolving into tears. This is why you're better off with interactive games like Simon Says, Mother May I?, Red Light/Green Light, Hide and Seek, and Leapfrog. You can also ask your child's teacher what games the kids like at school.After some high-energy play, your guests might be ready for a quieter activity. The preschool urge to dig in dirt often returns for 6-year-olds, who enjoy exploring with their hands. If you can deal with the mess, the kids will love making mud pies in the backyard or at the park. A messy art project  finger painting with chocolate pudding, creating art with glitter and glue, drawing on the cement with chalk  might also be a big hit.After the kids have had cake, they'll likely be ready to tear around. If you have a backyard, you can put out some jump ropes and balls and let them go nuts. The children can play on their own, but it's smart to have a few games up your sleeve just in case conflict arises and you need to distract them.You could also rent a bounce house or walk to a neighborhood park and arrange for their parents to pick them up there.Get some helpAnother way to top off the party is with an entertainer. Online, you'll find a wide assortment  from princesses who bring trunks full of dress-ups, to farmers who can set up mini petting zoos with goats and chickens in your backyard, to magicians who wow the kids with tricks. By age 6, kids are used to performers, so you don't need to worry about them getting frightened.On a tight budget? Tap your friends or the parents of your party guests to see if they can do face painting, or play the guitar and lead the kids in song."
Planning your child's sixth birthday party: Goody bags,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-childs-sixth-birthday-party-goody-bags_10349569.bc,"Six-year-olds tend to be takers  not givers  and they will love any party favors you hand out before they go home. In fact, they may have been to enough parties by now that they'll expect a party favor. Just make sure that each child gets exactly the same thing and the same amount because 6-year-olds are experts at spotting unfair situations: ""Ella's ball is pink and mine is red. I want a pink one! That's not fair!""Six-year-olds love to play with the little whistles, yo-yos, erasers, and magnifying glasses that are often stuffed in a goody bag. But often these break quickly and end up in the garbage can within a day. One good option is to give just one durable or useful item that ties into the theme: pink bubble bath for a princess party, a toy race car for a Hot Rod fest, a packet of wildflower seeds for a garden theme, cat- and dog-shaped cookie cutters for a pets theme.Double dutyAnother idea: Give the kids an art project so they can make their own going-home gifts. Children will enjoy decorating T-shirts with puffy paints, stringing necklaces with brightly colored macaroni, weaving construction paper placemats, and making wooden spoon puppets, egg carton caterpillars, or paper bowl turtles."
Planning your 7- or 8-year-old's birthday party: What your child is ready for,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-7-or-8-year-olds-birthday-party-what-your-chil_10349703.bc,"Seven and 8 are wonderful party ages. Big kids are open-minded, sociable, curious, and generally well behaved. They've been to a lot of birthday parties by now and get excited about fresh twists on the traditional party elements - ice cream sandwiches instead of a cake, take-home art projects instead of goody bags.Game onAt this age, they're ready for group and competitive games; relay races are always a huge hit. They're able to follow more complex directions, which means you can organize a game of Capture the Flag. And they're comfortable with the idea of a drop-off party. Parents who feel like they've been throwing the same birthday party for the past several years may welcome all of these new developments.Lucky sevenSeven-year-olds are less likely than 8-year-olds to beg for a party at the laser tag place or bowling alley. Many will be content with a party at home or a park or rec center. Seven-year-olds tend to be a bit quieter and easier to manage than the more loquacious, boisterous 8-year-olds. If you have a big shindig in mind, it might be better to do it at 7 than at 8.The great eightEight-year-olds are looking for novelty. Going out to an ice cream parlor, pizza joint, or paint-your-own-pottery place is particularly popular at this age. Of course, a home party can be a success with 8-year-olds, but you'll need a lengthy list of elaborate projects and games to keep them entertained.Fun for the whole familyYou could throw an afternoon backyard barbecue and invite neighbors, family, and school friends and their parents. The kids will like it if you section off a children's corner and fill it with toys, dress-up clothes, and arts and crafts projects. You might also want some organized games, and possibly a bounce house or entertainer, so the adults can hang out while the kids jump around or watch magic tricks."
Planning your 7- or 8-year-old's birthday party: The invite list,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-7-or-8-year-olds-birthday-party-the-invite-lis_10349712.bc,"Eight is enoughEight or so is a good number of guests for a 7-year-old's party  though you can probably manage ten or 12 or even more if you have another adult helper. Kids this age typically behave well at parties; they listen to adults and get along with friends.Eight-year-olds by contrast are often physically wild and boisterous. The party will go more smoothly if you limit the number of guests to eight or fewer. Then again, it's usually safe to overinvite since grade-schoolers' weekend schedules are filled with activities. Not everyone you invite will be able to make it.Most kids this age want to invite school friends. It's easiest to pass out invitations at school, but keep in mind that the invitations could end up languishing in your child's backpack with a week-old banana peel. What's more, kids this age have been known to dangle an invite in the face of someone who hasn't been asked.To prevent hurt feelings, don't pass invitations out at school. Mail or email them instead.Coed celebration?You can invite both boys and girls, but at this age it often works best to have an all-girl or all-boy party. Boys  especially 8-year-olds  might feel strongly about preferring no girls, while girls more often willingly include boys. The stereotypes often prove true, with girls preferring quieter activities such as art projects, while boys like high-energy games such as relay races and balloon tosses.Meet the parents?With both 7- and 8-year-olds, a drop-off party is the norm and all the kids will probably separate easily from their parents. On your invitation, make the drop-off and pick-up times clear.Helping handIf you don't have relatives or friends to help, contact one of the guest's parents ahead of time and ask if she'll stick around to help. Often you can reach an ""If you help me at my party, I'll help you at yours"" agreement. When parents drop off their children, put out a piece of paper near the door where they can write down a contact number in case of emergency.The invitesIf you make the invitations by hand, most 7-year-olds will enjoy assisting, while 8-year-olds can often do it themselves. Kids this age are known for trying to write neatly, and their handwriting might be even better than yours. Of course, you can always make the invites on the computer or send out emails  your child can help with this as well."
Planning your 7- or 8-year-old's birthday party: Choosing a theme,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-7-or-8-year-olds-birthday-party-choosing-a-the_10349714.bc,"Keep it simpleSeven and 8-year-olds have definite interests  Star Wars! Hannah Montana! Horses!  so choosing a theme will likely be a piece of cake. If your child wants the party to revolve around a pop culture icon, it's easy to buy a party kit with cups, napkins, decorations, the works.Get creativeBut with this age, the theme at a party is often less about characters appearing on paper cups and more about creative activities  so try to think less about how the decorations can tie into the theme and more about what the kids can do that will relate to it.How about a puppet party? Have the kids make puppets with wooden spoons and paper bags and plates and then put on a show for their parents at pickup. Or throw a Hawaiian luau: The children can make grass skirts with green crepe paper, munch on skewers of fresh pineapple and chicken teriyaki, and learn how to hula dance from an instructor. Or put on a dance party: Hang a disco ball, put on some music, and let the kids move and groove. A CD featuring the birthday child's favorite songs is the perfect party favor.Geek outKids this age are curious and love a science-themed party. Create a chemistry station by covering a table with a vinyl tablecloth, filling clear plastic cups with water and food coloring, and putting out some baking soda and lemon. Construct a volcano with clay and make it explode using red food coloring, baking soda, and lemon. You can also go on a bug hunt, play with slime, and pass out magnifying glasses as party favors.Tire 'em outFor a high-energy group, throw a mini Olympics, with an Egg Toss, Tug of War, and tricycle, crab walk, potato sack, and three-legged races. You can divide the kids up into teams, hand out medals, and even hold an awards ceremony when the parents pick up the kids."
Planning your 7- or 8-year-old's birthday party: Goody bags,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-7-or-8-year-olds-birthday-party-goody-bags_10349717.bc,"Most 7- and 8-year-olds are willing to let go of traditional elements of a birthday party. If you don't pass out goody bags, they probably won't put up a fuss  especially if you hand out prizes for games instead. You can make sure everyone gets a prize while also acknowledging the winner by offering treats to all guests but allowing the winner to pick first.Of course, goody bags are still lots of fun, especially if your party has a theme you can tie into. Try to use your wits rather than lots of money. If your party has a sports theme, you could pass out medals (made with cardboard, foil, and ribbon). Or take instant photographs of the kids  especially if they're in costume  and hand them out at the end. If you're hosting a group of girls, you could paint their nails before they leave. Many boys would love a cardboard sword covered in foil or spray-painted gold."
Planning your 7- or 8-year-old's birthday party: Presents,https://www.babycenter.com/0_planning-your-7-or-8-year-olds-birthday-party-presents_10349718.bc,"At ages 7 and 8, presents are a big deal. Your child will know exactly what she wants for her birthday and she will probably share her list with her friends. Often groups of friends are collecting the same toys, and they're excited about each other's stuff. When the day of the party arrives, everyone will be anticipating the present-opening session, and parents can make sure everything goes smoothly by having a plan ahead of time.Timing's everythingYou'll want to decide where guests should put the presents when they walk through the door  ideally in a place that's out of reach of little hands. You'll also need to pick a time for gift opening. Right after cake is often good. Your child can pass out goody bags at the same time. After she opens a friend's gift, she gives the friend a bag  this way there's an exchange and everyone is happy.Be sure to talk with your child beforehand to make clear when the gift unwrapping will take place. If you don't do this, your child may nag you about it throughout the party or start ripping presents open when you're not looking.To prevent a free-for-all, hand gifts to your child one at a time. You can solve the ""Open mine first!"" dilemma by writing numbers on pieces of paper and putting them in a bowl. As kids arrive, have them pull out a number and tape it on their present. Later, gifts are opened in numerical order.Is it acceptable to open presents after the party? More and more this is considered okay. If you're hosting more than ten kids, the present opening can go on too long. And if you're holding the event at a party place, the schedule might not allow time for presents. But some of your child's friends might ask for their presents to be opened. If this happens, you could let your child unwrap the gift near the end of the party.Giving thanksRemind your child to say something nice about each gift she opens and to say thank you even if it's a toy or book she doesn't want or already has. Children need to learn the etiquette of unwrapping gifts, and a birthday party is a great place to learn.At this age, your child is ready to take on some responsibility for sending thank-you notes. It's important to reinforce that thank-you notes are the rule for birthdays and holidays, so try to build time for it into the week following the party.Some parents who are really strapped for time write generic thank-you cards before the party and put them in guests' goody bags. And some families send out thank-you emails in lieu of paper cards. Is this acceptable? That's debatable. Some might say it's inconsiderate and lazy, while others would say that you're saving trees."
Let's Play! Leaf Peeping & Roll-Over Plan,https://www.babycenter.com/0_lets-play-leaf-peeping-roll-over-plan_1498438.bc,"Leaf PeepingAt this age, your baby seems endlessly curious about the world and excited by seeing new things. You're probably spending lots of time out and about, looking for new sights to introduce him to.Appropriate for: 6 weeks to 3 monthsSkills developed: VisualWhat you'll need: A few brightly colored leaves; tapeThe next time you take your baby out for a walk, collect a few brightly colored leaves to show him. (If it's not fall, pick a few leaves in unusual shapes and colors.) Tape the stems of the leaves to the sunshade of his stroller: They make wonderful natural mobiles, as even the slightest breath of wind sends them turning and twirling above his little head.Safety note: If your baby has learned to grab, make sure the leaves aren't within reach.Roll-Over PlanAt almost 3 months old, your baby is really working on gaining control over the way she moves. This simple indoor or outdoor exercise will help get her ready to roll.Appropriate for: 2 to 6 monthsSkills developed: Gross motor, sense of touch, body awarenessWhat you'll need: A fairly large blanketOn a warm day, take your baby to the park or out into your backyard and spread a blanket on a patch of grass or soft ground (or simply do this in your home). Take off as many layers of clothing as weather permits, as babies seem to feel freer to move around when they find themselves in the buff. If you have some cloth diapers, you might even spread those under her and let her go diaperless for a few minutes.Lay your baby on her stomach or back, and help her roll over (or let her roll herself over if she's capable of it). Then roll her over again yourself, so she's back in the original position. Continue in one direction until she reaches the edge of the blanket  to give her a sense of getting somewhere  then lift her back to the center again. Keep doing this as long as your baby enjoys it. Babies delight in new perspectives, so if she seems to savor a certain position, lie down next to her and check things out together.Remember: Each baby develops at a different pace, so if yours isn't quite ready for this week's activities, don't worry  just try them again in a few weeks.See all our Baby ActivitiesVisit your 2-month-old, week 4 pageShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2012a.

Health insurance during pregnancy: How does my health plan work?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_health-insurance-during-pregnancy-how-does-my-health-plan-wo_10413608.bc,"How does a health insurance plan work?There are many different kinds of plans. Some have deductibles, some don't. Some use copayments, some use coinsurance. Most employer or government sites have tools that can help you compare costs among plans and understand your benefits.In addition, the Affordable Care Act requires all health insurance plans to provide you with two easy-to-understand documents that explain their specifics: Evidence of Coverage and a Summary of Benefits and Coverage.Here are the most common terms you'll see and what they mean:Allowed amountThe allowed amount is what your insurer decides it will pay for a medical service. This is generally based on the amount usually charged for the same or a similar medical service in your area, which is known as the usual, customary, and reasonable (UCR) amount.Your insurer may only cover a percentage of the allowed amount for a service or visit, even if your provider charges more. In this case, you must pay the difference.For example, if your doctor charges $200 for a visit and your insurer says the allowed amount for the visit is $100, you are responsible for the additional $100 in addition to your copay or coinsurance.CoinsuranceThis is the portion of your medical costs that you must pay after you've met your deductible. For example, once coinsurance kicks in, you may pay 30 percent of the cost of a visit (that's $30 for a $100 visit) and your insurer would pay the other 70 percent. (The percentage you pay would be higher if the provider is out of network.)However, your insurer will only cover the percentage of the amount that they consider reasonable for the service in your area. This is the allowed amount. So, in this example, if your doctor charges $200 for a visit and your insurer says the visit should only cost $100, then the insurer will pay $70 and you will pay $130 ($30 + $100).DeductibleThis is the amount you have to pay for medical services each year before your insurance will start to cover a portion of the cost. That means you may have to pay the full amount for some services until you have paid the total amount of your deductible. (Some plans have separate deductible amounts for hospital stays, ER visits, medications, etc.)Some plans will pay for certain services (such as annual checkups and preventive care) regardless of whether you have met your deductible. These services may be covered in full or they may require a copayment from you.Evidence of CoverageEvidence of Coverage is a document showing detailed information about your benefits and coverage. It specifies the services that will and will not be covered, the actions you have to take to receive the benefits, and what you'll have to pay and when. The document also explains the process for appealing decisions made by the insurance company. Flexible Spending Account (FSA)A flexible spending account and a health savings account are both pretax money taken from your paycheck, but with a flexible spending account, you have to use all the money in it by the end of the year. FSAs are only available with employer-sponsored insurance plans.Your employer may grant you a grace period of an extra couple of months to use the money in your account or allow you to carry over up to $500 a year to use in the next year, but they are not required to do either of these things.At the end of the year or grace period, you lose any money left over in your FSA. So it's important to plan carefully and not put more money in your FSA than you think you'll spend on healthcare costs within a year.Grandfathered planGrandfathered plans are older health plans that are not required to provide all of the benefits and services mandated by the Affordable Care Act (""Obamacare""). To qualify, the plan must have existed on March 23, 2010, and not been significantly changed since then.HMO (Health Maintenance Organization)An HMO will usually only cover visits to doctors in its network. It generally won't cover out-of-network care except in an emergency. HMOs usually require you to get a referral from your primary care physician for a visit to a specialist other than your ob-gyn.You'll pay a set copayment for each doctor or ER visit. Premiums are generally lower than for a PPO plan.Health Reimbursement Account (HRA)A health reimbursement account is a bank account that your employer puts money into for you to use for healthcare costs. These accounts are usually connected with high-deductible plans for which you and your employer pay less on premiums.Your employer passes that savings on to you by putting money into your HRA. Neither you nor your employer must pay taxes on this money. As with other accounts, you get a list of medical services and medications that you can pay for with this money.The money in an HRA account can carry over from one year to the next, although your employer can limit the amount that carries over. If you leave your job, your employer keeps the money in the account. Health Savings Account (HSA)A health savings account is a bank account you can use to pay for medical costs if you're enrolled in a high-deductible health plan. You can decide how much money to have taken out of each paycheck (before taxes are deducted) and put in your HSA, up to a certain annual limit. (Your employer may contribute some money to your account as well.)You use the bank card for this account to pay for medical services and medications. (You'll get a list of services that are included.) The advantage of these accounts is that you don't have to pay taxes on the money you spend on health costs. That means you're actually paying about 20 to 30 percent less for these costs, depending on your tax rate.Unlike with a flexible spending account, you don't have to spend all the money in your HSA by the end of the year. The account stays with you from year to year and even if you leave your job. You have the rest of your life to use whatever money is in the account, as long as you use it for a ""qualified"" medical expense.These include nearly all medical expenses, not including premiums (which are already paid with pretax dollars). You can even use the money for over-the-counter medications if you have your doctor write you a prescription for them.High-deductible health planHigh-deductible plans feature higher deductibles than traditional health insurance plans. The plan is often paired with an HSA or HRA, healthcare accounts that help you pay less for medical costs.One advantage of this type of plan is that you generally pay a lower premium.Of course, it also means you'll be paying the full cost for some or all health services until you hit that deductible amount. After you've paid enough to cover your deductible, you generally pay a certain percentage of further medical costs (called coinsurance) until your hit your annual out-of-pocket maximum.In-network and out-of-networkIf a provider (a doctor, specialist, hospital, lab, or pharmacy) is in your network, it means they have agreed to provide a discounted rate to your insurer. Some plans (usually HMOs) will only cover services from providers in their network. In that case, you have to pay the full cost if you go to a provider outside the network. Other plans cover services from out-of-network (or ""non-preferred"") providers but will ask you to pay a higher copay or coinsurance percentage for them.Out-of-pocket maximumThis is supposed to be the highest amount your insurer will ask you to pay for medical costs for the year. Once you have paid this amount of money, your insurer is supposed to cover 100 percent of any other medical costs you have for the remainder of the year.However, read the fine print to find out what is included in this amount. It almost always includes your yearly deductible, but it doesn't necessarily include premiums or out-of-network costs. (Some plans have a separate, higher out-of-pocket maximum for out-of-network care.) And you will still be responsible for costs that are more than the allowed amount for any service.Note that the out-of-pocket maximum is higher for couples and families than for individuals. Pre-authorization or pre-certificationIf your insurance company requires pre-authorization or pre-certification for something, they are asking for proof that the particular service, drug, or equipment is medically necessary.These are generally not routine things (like annual checkups). They're more likely to be procedures like CT scans, elective services like substance abuse residential programs, or special medications. Some insurers require pre-authorization before you're admitted to the hospital for delivery.Your healthcare provider should know when something requires pre-authorization and will contact your insurance company to obtain it. The insurance company has a list of items it will authorize. If the requested treatment is not on the list, it will conduct a review to determine whether it will cover it.Pre-authorization does not mean that the entire cost of the service will be covered by insurance. Your deductible and co-insurance or co-pay will still apply. But failing to get pre-authorization could mean that you'll wind up paying the full price.By the way, your hospital will have you register online in advance of your arrival for delivery. This is called a pre-admission certification and is not the same as a pre-authorization.PPO (Preferred Provider Organization, also called open access plan)A PPO is a plan that coordinates a network of providers who agree to provide healthcare at reduced rates. This type of plan allows you to visit any healthcare provider you like without a referral from a primary care physician. You don't have to choose a provider within the network, but you'll pay less if you do.You'll probably have to meet an annual deductible before the plan starts covering a portion of your bills. You usually have to pay a copay for certain services or cover a certain percentage of the total charges (coinsurance).PremiumThis is the amount you pay each month (or each paycheck) to the insurer for your coverage. The total for the year is your annual premium. This amount will be higher if you have a partner or children on your plan. (It may also be higher if you work part-time.) If you have insurance coverage through your employer, your company will usually cover part of the premium, so it's likely to be lower than the amount you would pay for a plan on the marketplace.Qualified health planA qualified health plan is an insurance plan that's certified by the government. These plans must provide the basic health benefits required by the Affordable Care Act and set limits on expenses like deductibles and copayments.If you choose a health plan that is not qualified, you'll have to pay the same fee to the Internal Revenue Service that people without health insurance coverage must pay. (All healthcare marketplace and employer-sponsored plans are qualified.)Special enrollment periodUnder normal circumstances, you can sign up for insurance only during the annual open enrollment period (usually November through January). However, you may be eligible for a special enrollment period if you lose your current coverage or experience a ""qualifying life event"" (such as a marriage or birth). This gives you 60 days to sign up for a marketplace plan or 30 days to sign up for an employer-based plan.Summary of benefits and coverageThis is a short explanation of your plan's benefits and coverage, which is helpful when comparing plans. The document should be in plain, easy-to-understand language and should include an explanation of healthcare terms.Show sources Hide sources HealthCare.gov.

Best foods for new moms: Energy boosters,https://www.babycenter.com/0_best-foods-for-new-moms-energy-boosters_1458856.bc,"Life with a newborn is exhausting. It's usually impossible to get enough rest and exercise in those first few demanding months, and it's difficult to eat well.But as all-consuming as caring for an infant can be, it's important to take care of yourself too. Choosing healthy foods  and following a few simple eating strategies  will help keep you energized through your busy days and nights.Start with a balanced diet, and drink plenty of water. Try to make time to sit down for a quick snack or meal  even if you have to put the baby down or hand her off to your partner or a helper for a few minutes.And make every meal count. Here are some of the best strategies for getting an energy boost from your food. If you need more guidance, the USDA's MyPlate website offers a customized daily food plan based on your age, gender, and activity level.Begin with a better breakfastProteins (such as eggs and yogurt), and complex carbohydrates (like whole grain bread and cereals) are better breakfast choices than simple carbohydrates or sugar. So instead of reaching for a plain bagel, a bowl of sugary cereal, or a piece of white toast  all simple carbs  try a smoothie made with fruit and yogurt, a bowl of oatmeal or whole grain cereal, or scrambled eggs on whole wheat toast.Simple carbs cause your blood sugar to spike and then crash, leaving you feeling sleepy. Complex carbs give you longer-lasting energy, help you feel full longer, and provide more vitamins and minerals, explains pediatrician James Sears, coauthor ofThe Baby Book.""A protein-rich, complex carbohydrate-rich breakfast is very important  and probably the opposite of what most people do,"" he says.Eat small meals throughout the dayRather than eating three large meals, aim to eat five smaller meals to keep your energy up, Sears suggests.""It's a better way of eating,"" he says, because it keeps your energy level on an even keel the whole day long, rather than seesawing between hunger and fullness.If you're having trouble eating one meal a day, let alone several, try keeping the fridge stocked with easy snacks or quick small meals high in protein or complex carbs. Grazing throughout the day will be easier if you have a tasty selection of high-energy snacks to choose from.Try whole wheat bagels or toast with peanut butter, edamame, hummus on pita bread, cheese and crackers, trail mix with nuts and dried fruit, and yogurt with fruit. Resist the urge to dietNobody likes to wear their maternity clothes after the baby has arrived. But even if you're frustrated with the pace of your postpartum weight loss, now is not a good time to skip meals or drastically cut back your caloric intake.""It's important not to worry about your weight right now,"" says Debra Gilbert Rosenberg, author of The New Mom's Companion,who advises new mothers to focus on sustaining their strength rather than achieving weight loss goals.Wait until your milk supply is well established, you've fully recovered from pregnancy and childbirth, and your healthcare provider has given you the green light before you slowly work on shedding extra pounds. (See our diet for healthy postpartum weight loss.) Aim to lose about a pound and a half a week, and give yourself at least 6 months to a year to return to your pre-pregnancy weight.But even then, try to resist the urge to crash diet or impose strict weight loss goals, especially if you're breastfeeding. If you're nursing, you'll actually need to eat about 500 more calories a day than you did before you became pregnant in order to maintain your milk supply.""Your body is going to [lose weight] the way it's going to do it, and you have to respect that,"" says Rosenberg. Losing too much weight too quickly after giving birth saps your energy and might even affect your milk supply. Learn more about a healthy diet while breastfeeding.Drink, drink, drinkIn the first few weeks after you have your baby, dehydration will make any fatigue or sleepiness you're experiencing worse. So it's important to guzzle water like it's going out of style. ""Drinking a lot of liquids is probably the easiest thing people can do"" to keep their energy up, Rosenberg says.Keep a water bottle handy around the house, in your diaper bag, and in the car or stroller, so you can stay hydrated no matter where you are. If you're breastfeeding, you might be extra thirsty so make sure to drink about 13 8-ounce glasses of water or other unsweetened, noncaffeinated beverages every day.Don't rely on caffeine or sugarIt's tempting to reach for a cup of coffee whenever you're exhausted, or grab a candy bar when you need quick energy. But be careful not to rely on caffeinated drinks or sugary snacks to keep you going when you're running on empty.Both caffeine and sugar will give you a quick burst of energy, but once that initial surge is gone, you'll be left feeling even more tired than before.Caffeine can make your baby irritable and restless too, so limit your caffeine intake to 300 milligrams a day  about two 8-ounce cups of coffee. Grab a piece of fruitA piece of fruit is the best bet when you need a quick pick-me-up, according to registered dietitian Jo Ann Hattner. Fruit gives you a burst of energy but doesn't cause a later ""crash"" like junk food laden with refined sugar.Plus, fruits like apples, oranges, peaches, and pears are high in fiber, which helpskeep your digestive tract moving. Best of all: Most fruit requires no prep work or cleanup, and is easy to eat on the go.Choose energy bars carefullyAn energy bar can be helpful as an occasional way to sustain yourself between meals, especially when you're away from home and need a quick fix.But be cautious about reaching for an energy bar regularly, says Hattner, because they're often surprisingly high in calories and sugar. Check the label to make sure the energy bars you choose are low in sugar and fat and high in fiber, protein, and carbohydrates.Food can only do so muchFinally, know that even the most energy-packed food can't counteract sleep deprivation. If possible, take a quick nap the next time you're feeling weary, rather than turning to food.""We tend to eat, thinking that will give us energy,"" Hattner says. ""It may just be that you need a nap.""Show sources Hide sources ARHP. 2008. Counseling postpartum patients about diet and exercise.

Getting the most from HIV medication,https://www.babycenter.com/0_getting-the-most-from-hiv-medication_10415064.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineHow can I stick to my HIV treatment plan?The most important thing to do is probably the simplest: Go to all your medical appointments. That way, your healthcare provider can help you monitor the medications you're taking, watch out for any side effects, and supervise your general condition.A treatment plan for HIV consists of medications that make up antiretroviral therapy (ART). There's a lot you can do to help yourself stay on track:Talk with your provider about your plan, so you can develop the one that works best for you. Ask for a written copy of the plan, and make sure it details each of your medications, including how and when to take them.Find out what side effects to expect and how to deal with them.Understand how the treatment plan protects you and your baby from infection and helps prevent the virus from becoming resistant to other medication. Knowing this may motivate you to stay on the plan.Talk to your provider about any challenges you face that could affect your ability to take HIV medication. Maintaining a treatment plan can be harder if you're also dealing with substance abuse or alcoholism, unstable housing, mental illness, relationship problems, or other issues.Use a seven-day pillbox to organize pills for each day. Fill it at the start of every week.Tell your provider about your daily schedule so you can plan your medication to fit in with your life, rather than organizing your life around medication.Take your pills at the same time as something else that you do regularly each day  watching the news, brushing your teeth, or arriving home from work.Use your phone to set reminders, either with the alarm or by using an app. The AIDSinfo HIV/AIDS Drug Database App bookmarks HIV medicines, allows you to add your own notes about a drug, and has a daily pill reminder feature.Ask your family members, friends, or co-workers to remind you to take your medicines.Always have access to your medication and keep a spare supply at work. If you're traveling, pack enough to last for the whole trip.Join a support group, either online or in your community. Getting advice and encouragement from others going through the same thing helps.How can I get the most out of HIV medication?Take HIV medication exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. That means taking it:at the right timewith food, or before or after meals, depending on the advice you've been givenevery day, including weekends, holidays, and even when you're in laborTaking medication consistently can be difficult. It helps to keep track of what you take and when on a computer, phone, or in a notebook. The important information to track includes:the name of each medicinethe dosethe number of pills to takewhen to take the medicationWith ART, you'll likely take several pills a day, each with its own requirements.Missing a dose, or taking it at the wrong time, can result in an increase in the amount of HIV in your body, putting your health at risk and increasing the chance of passing the virus on to your baby.Drug resistance is also a problem with regularly missed doses. Drug resistance means certain drugs no longer work to reduce HIV in the blood.What should I do if I forget to take my HIV medication?Don't panic. Call your healthcare provider. In most cases, your provider will say to take the medicine if you just missed it.Discuss medication at each appointment with your provider. Tell your provider if you're having difficulty following your medication regimen.Don't forget to mention any side effects you're having. Side effects from HIV medicines are a major reason why sticking to a treatment plan can be difficult.Let your provider know if your treatment plan is too complicated to follow. Your provider may simplify your regimen to include fewer HIV medicines or to reduce the number of times a day you need to take them.What else does my healthcare provider need to know?Tell your provider about any other medications you take. This includes other prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products. Other medicines or supplements may interact with HIV medication. A drug interaction can reduce or increase the effect of HIV medicine or cause side effects.Tell your health care provider about anything that makes it difficult to stick to your treatment plan. For example, lack of health insurance and alcohol or drug abuse can make it hard to follow HIV treatment. If needed, your healthcare provider can recommend resources to help you address any issues you have before you start treatment.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2012.

Diet for healthy post-baby weight loss,https://www.babycenter.com/0_diet-for-healthy-post-baby-weight-loss_3566.bc,"Eager to get back into shape now that you're no longer pregnant? For long-term success  and to keep yourself feeling good along the way  keep these tips in mind.Don't start dieting too soonYour body needs time to recover from labor and delivery. Give yourself until your six-week postpartum checkup before you start watching your calorie intake and actively trying to slim down. And if you're breastfeeding, experts recommend that you wait until your baby is at least 2 months old before you try to lose weight. (If you're a nursing mom, you may also want to read our article on a healthy breastfeeding diet.)Starting a diet too soon after giving birth can delay your recovery and make you feel more tired  and you need all the energy you can muster to adjust to life with your newborn. In addition, if you're nursing, dieting can affect your milk supply. If you're patient and give your body a chance to do its work, you may be surprised at how much weight you lose naturally, especially if you're breastfeeding.Be realistic about weight lossKeep in mind that you may not be able to return to your exact pre-pregnancy weight or shape. For many women, pregnancy causes permanent changes such as a softer belly, slightly wider hips, and a larger waistline. With this in mind, you might want to adjust your goals a bit.

See all baby videosEmbrace exerciseThere's no magic pill to help you lose weight: A healthy diet combined with regular exercise is the best way to shed the pounds  and to keep them off. And it's important to exercise while trying to lose weight to ensure you're losing fat instead of muscle.Once you're ready to begin losing weight, start by eating a little less and being more active  even if you're just taking a quick walk around the block with your baby in the stroller.Find out whether your body is ready for exercise and visit our postpartum fitness area for information on getting back into shape. Lose weight slowlyDon't go on a strict, restrictive diet. Women need a minimum of 1,200 calories a day to stay healthy, and most women need more than that  between 1,500 and 2,200 calories a day  to keep up their energy and prevent mood swings. And if you're nursing, you need a bare minimum of 1,800 calories a day (most nursing moms need more like 2,000 to 2,700 calories) to nourish both yourself and your baby.If you're breastfeeding, you'll want to make sure to take it slow  losing weight too quickly can cause a decrease in your milk supply.Too-rapid weight loss can also release toxins that are stored in your body fat into the bloodstream  and into your milk supply. (Toxins that can make it into your bloodstream include environmental contaminants like the heavy metals lead and mercury, persistent organic pollutants like PCBs and dioxins, and solvents.)Weight loss of about a pound and a half a week is safe and won't affect your milk supply if you're nursing. To achieve this, cut out 500 calories a day from your current diet (without dipping below the safe minimum) by either decreasing your food intake or increasing your activity level.Eat up  and take your time!With a new baby and schedule, it can be hard to find the time to eat. But skipping meals can make energy levels lag  and it won't help you lose weight. Many moms find that eating five to six small meals a day with healthy snacks in between (rather than three larger meals) fits their appetite and schedule better. (A small meal might be half a sandwich, some carrot sticks, fruit, and a glass of milk.)Don't skip meals in an attempt to lose weight  it won't help, because you'll be more likely to eat more at other meals. And you'll also probably feel tired and grouchy.Even if you've never been much of a breakfast person, keep in mind that eating breakfast can help keep you from feeling famished  and tired  later in the morning, and it can give you the energy to be more active.In addition, numerous studies show that skipping breakfast can sabotage your weight loss efforts. According to the National Weight Control Registry, which has tallied the successful strategies of dieters who have lost an average of 66 pounds and kept it off for 5.5 years, 78 percent of the dieters eat breakfast daily.Slow your eating down, too, if possible. When you take your time eating, you'll notice that it's easier to tell when you feel full  and you're less likely to overeat. Be choosy about foods and drinksResearch shows that consuming low-fat milk and dairy products and choosing whole grain products like whole wheat bread and whole grain cereal can help you lose weight. Other good choices include low-fat, high-fiber foods such as fruits (like apples, oranges, and berries) and raw vegetables (like carrots, jicama, and red pepper strips) for healthy snacks.Other ways to squeeze in more fruits and veggies: Make fruit (or veggie) smoothies, use fruit or vegetable salsas or vegetable reduction sauces (sauces made from pured vegetables) over fish or chicken, add shredded carrots to your sandwich, try grilled vegetables, and try pured vegetable soups. (Pureing your soup makes it creamy without having to add cream, which is high in calories and saturated fat. It's also a great way to eat veggies you might not ordinarily eat on their own.)Fat has twice as many calories as carbohydrates or proteins, so trimming the extra fat from your diet is probably the easiest way to cut calories. Look for low-fat or fat-free dairy products (you don't need to drink whole milk in order to make quality breast milk!), choose broiled or baked rather than fried foods, and limit your intake of sweets, which have extra calories from sugar and fat.Keep in mind, though, that fat is an important nutrient, so your goal isn't to eliminate it from your diet. In fact, including some fat at each meal will help you stay full and keep you from overeating carbohydrates. (Too many calories from any source  fat, protein, or carbs  can lead to weight gain or keep you from accomplishing weight loss.)The trick is to choose ""good"" fats rather than ""bad"" fats. The best fats are mono- and polyunsaturated fats, like those in canola oil, olive oil, avocado, olives, nuts and seeds, and fatty fish like salmon. The oils to avoid are saturated and trans fats, which can contribute to heart disease and perhaps diabetes, and can be transferred to breast milk, too.Saturated fats are found in meats and dairy products, and trans fats are typically found in many fried foods, snack foods, and baked goods. (Food labels specify which kinds of fats the products contain.)Finally, although you should be drinking about 8 or 9 cups of fluids each day, watch what you drink  a surprising number of calories can be hidden in juice, soda, and coffee drinks.Daily food plan for healthy post-baby weight lossThe food plan below adds up to 2,200 calories a day for breastfeeding moms. For non-breastfeeding moms, it totals 1,800 calories a day. Use this as a rough guide  your individual calorie needs will vary depending on your weight, metabolism, and activity level, and also on how much you're breastfeeding.View and print daily food plan.Show sources Hide sources American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Drugs. 2001.

Tips for helping your toddler adjust to travel,https://www.babycenter.com/0_tips-for-helping-your-toddler-adjust-to-travel_6992.bc,"New sights and sounds can be overwhelming to a young child. Vacation excitement can quickly turn to temper tantrums if you try to do too much too soon, so set realistic expectations and let toddlers soak up the experience at their own pace.Bring a blankie and cuddly toyA favorite blanket, special sheet, burp cloth, or stuffed animal can help your little one feel safe and secure. It can ease his anxiety about getting to  or being in  a new place.While keeping track of yet another item may seem like an extra hassle for you, clutching something soft and familiar will keep your child happier and more pleasant to travel with. Have a replacement lovey on hand in case the original gets lost.Start  and end  your day earlyTraveling with a toddler is not about sleeping in or staying out late. Young children are at their best earlier in the day, so plan to travel, sight-see, or explore in the morning. Afternoons and evenings are a good time for playing outdoors or relaxing back at your hotel.Respecting your child's inner clock will make her less likely to throw a tantrum in the car, the street, or a crowded museum.Establish a routine and stick to itTravel can wreak havoc on a toddler's daily routine, and your little one may get upset if his physical needs for regular eating and sleeping are not met. Keeping your child's nap and meal schedule perfectly on track may be impossible, but he'll be a happier traveler if you establish a routine.This doesn't mean watching the clock the whole time you're away from home  eating meals and taking naps at the same time each day may be all the routine he needs to feel comfortable in his new environment.Changing time zones can complicate the adjustment process, and children do get jet lag, but not to the same extent as adults. A well-rested child  or adult, for that matter  copes better than a tired one with time changes, so have your whole family rest up before you travel.To minimize the effects of jet lag, plan to arrive at your destination in the evening and stick to your usual bedtime routine: For example, give your child a bath, read him a book, and put him to sleep at his usual bedtime in the new time zone.If you're in, let's say, London and it's 7 p.m. there, put him down to sleep even if it's eight hours ahead of his normal bedtime. It will take a few days to adjust. Eat familiar foodsToddlers are notoriously picky eaters, and it's hard enough finding foods they like at home, let alone while you're traveling. You may be looking forward to sampling the local cuisine at your destination, but your child may be less excited about it.If you're going out to a restaurant, bring a supply of your toddler's favorite foods (such as goldfish crackers, O-shaped toasted oat cereal, fruit, or peanut butter and jelly sandwiches) to keep her satisfied and entertained while you enjoy your own meal.Stay close to home baseYour child's mood may be more unpredictable than usual when you're traveling, so it makes sense to establish a home base you can return to quickly and easily. Short jaunts away from your accommodations are less likely to tax your child's patience. And if the weather turns foul, someone gets sick, or your toddler just wants to nap, you can quickly head back to the room.Schedule running-around time for toddlersAfter being cooped up in a car, plane, or stroller all day, most toddlers are eager to be let loose. New walkers especially hate being confined, so spend time every day at a park or playground where your child can release some pent-up energy. A bonus: The more he races around during the day, the better he'll sleep at night.Expect the adjustment to take several daysNew faces and surroundings can be scary for a young child and make her cling to you more than usual. Combine fear with a dose of jet lag, a strange bed, new food, and all the other disruptions of travel, and you may end up with a child who's fussier and more demanding than usual.Once you arrive, expect to spend extra time making your child feel safe and secure in her new surroundings. After all, you're the best security blanket your child can have."
Freezer facts,https://www.babycenter.com/0_freezer-facts_1433914.bc,"Most parents can't live without a microwave oven. But another appliance  your freezer  is an unsung kitchen hero. You can buy food economically in bulk, such as meats, fish, bread, and apples (for pie making), and store it until needed. Or prepare a large batch of soup stock or a casserole and save it for later in meal-sized containers. And you can freeze leftovers such as soup or stew for quick and convenient future meals.Your freezer is also a handy place to store ingredients for the quick, nutritious types of meals kids love, from fish sticks and hot dogs to vegetables and, of course, desserts like sorbet, berries, and frozen yogurt. Not least, freezing is a great way to keep foods fresh longer. In fact, it's actually better to freeze nuts and breads (sliced before freezing) than to keep them in the pantry.To be safe and retain maximum flavor, remember these guidelines:Pay attention to temperatureTo prevent harmful bacteria from growing, don't let hot food cool down on the kitchen counter at room temperature. Instead, cool leftovers in the refrigerator. Cooling food first also prevents large ice crystals from forming during freezing, which can ruin flavor and texture.Divide large quantities of cooked food into smaller portions. Keep soups and stews to about three inches in depth per container, and divide meats into pieces that are two- to three-inches thick.Freezer temperatures should be between 0 and 8 degrees Fahrenheit.Wrap properlyPackaging counts when it comes to freezing food. Wrapping food well prevents freezer burn, which can affect texture and flavor. Freezer burn happens when frozen food starts to dehydrate. Look for plastic bags or plastic containers that are sold as ""freezer safe."" If you plan to reheat a frozen item in the same container, be sure it's safe for freezer-to-oven or freezer-to-microwave use. Don't wrap acidic foods, such as tomatoes, directly in foil, as the acid can react with the foil to produce an unusual flavor. Wrap as follows:Breads: It's fine to freeze bread in its original packaging, or put it in a plastic bag with the air forced out.Cooked vegetables, soups, casseroles: Use tight-sealing plastic containers.Fresh vegetables: Plastic zip bags  carefully sealed and with the air squeezed out work best.Meats: Double wrap them, first in freezer-safe plastic wrap and then in aluminum foil (use the heavy-duty kind) or freezer paper.One drawback to freezing is that it can change a food's texture. Frozen raspberries don't have the same crunch as fresh ones, so rather than serving them by themselves, it's better to use them in other ways, say as a dessert topping or in a smoothie. And a cream sauce that's been frozen on its own may separate on reheating. It's less likely to do so if mixed with pasta, and if it does separate, it won't be as noticeable and will still taste fine. Select the right locationFreeze meats and leftovers at the rear of the middle or lower shelves, where it's coldest  temperatures in the door fluctuate too much and aren't quite as cold. The door is best for storing juice concentrates and smaller items, such as packages of frozen vegetables or fruits. Some people like to organize the freezer by placing different types of foods (meats, breads, veggies) in specific areas, especially if space is tight, so they'll know at a glance where to find things. Avoid stacking packages in the freezer until their contents are fully frozen.Label everythingEven if you think you'll be using a frozen item right away, it's a good idea to mark the contents and date on the container. You can also write down the quantity and reheating instructions if someone else will be doing the reheating. Scribble right on aluminum foil with a waterproof or permanent marking pen. Or if you're using a dish, attach the information to the dish on a piece of masking tape. If you're a list maker or are superorganized, you can also keep a master list of freezer contents on the freezer door. Some people find this helps them plan meals and shopping lists.Defrost safelyFreezing smaller portions means you can defrost with less worry about bacteria. For instance, if you have a huge piece of meat, such as a turkey, the core can still be frozen while the outer surfaces get too warm. Always thaw a large item in the refrigerator rather than at room temperature.You can also defrost frozen foods in the microwave (set on ""defrost"") or in continuously running water that's cooler than 70 degrees Fahrenheit. Vegetables and some frozen foods (such as fish sticks) can be defrosted during the cooking process. Check package labels if you aren't sure.Limit length of storageFor safety and taste, foods shouldn't be kept in the freezer indefinitely. Below are recommended storage times for some commonly prepared foods. For additional storage times, see the University of Nebraska's ""Freezing Recommendations for Commonly Prepared Foods"".Meats: meatloaf, meatballs, roasts, cubed or chunky meat, ham, turkey, chicken, fishStorage time: one to three monthsCombination dishes: rice or spaghetti dishes, lasagna, chow mein, soups Storage time: three monthsBreads: rolls, sweet rolls, loaf of bread, coffee cake Storage time: three to six months"
Avoiding common pregnancy discomforts when you're on the road,https://www.babycenter.com/0_avoiding-common-pregnancy-discomforts-when-youre-on-the-road_6979.bc,"How can I relieve bloating, gas pain, and heartburn while traveling?When you're on the road, it can be hard to maintain a healthy diet and a regular eating schedule. Chances are you'll be eating out more, eating on the run, resorting to fatty fast-food meals, and eating foods you're not used to.Changes in time zones will shift your mealtimes. If you fly across country, you could find yourself eating supper at what would be midnight back home. As a result, travel can worsen the bloating, gas, and heartburn already common in pregnancy.If you've been having tummy trouble during your pregnancy, you're likely to have it while traveling, but you can take steps to lessen potential problems.Instead of eating three big meals, aim for several small meals throughout the day.Take your time eating and chew thoroughly. Don't gulp your drinks.Pack loose, comfortable clothing (nothing that's too tight around your waist or stomach).Advice for avoiding gas:Cut back on the foods that are most likely to cause gas. These include carbonated beverages, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, broccoli, asparagus, leeks, onions, scallions, artichokes, dried fruit, pears, apples, honey, soda, fruit drinks, wheat, corn, potatoes, oat bran, beans, peas, and high-fat and fried foods.Advice for avoiding heartburn:Avoid foods and drinks that cause heartburn, such as alcohol (which you should avoid anyway during pregnancy); caffeine; chocolate; acidic foods like citrus fruits, tomatoes, mustard, and vinegar; processed meats; mint products; and spicy, highly seasoned, fried, or fatty foods.Don't eat dinner too close to your bedtime. Give yourself two to three hours to digest before lying down. And try sleeping with your upper body propped up with several pillows.Don't smoke  in addition to contributing to a host of serious health problems, smoking boosts stomach acidity. (Ideally, this is a habit you should break before getting pregnant. If you're still smoking and having trouble quitting, ask your caregiver for a referral to a smoking-cessation program.)An over-the-counter antacid that contains magnesium or calcium may ease discomfort, but check with your prenatal caregiver before taking one, because some brands are high in sodium.Pregnancy heartburn Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:00Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:00Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videos How can I relieve constipation?If you suffer from constipation before you go on a trip, traveling can make it worse. Sitting for long stretches, changing your diet and mealtimes, not having a restroom readily available when you need one, not drinking enough fluids  all these can wreak havoc on your bowels. Try these tips to relieve or avoid the problem:Bring high-fiber foods like bran cereal, whole-grain breads, fresh or dried fruit, and fresh vegetables to snack on.Drink plenty of water. Getting enough fluids helps keep your digestive system moving. Prune juice can be particularly helpful. The Institute of Medicine recommends that pregnant women have about 10 8-ounces cups of water or other beverages each day. (Drink more if it's warm out or you're exercising.) Another way to ensure proper hydration is to monitor your urine color  if it's dark yellow or cloudy, you need to drink more.Exercise. Take breaks to walk and stretch. At your destination, take advantage of hotel fitness centers and swimming pools or local facilities.Your bowels are most likely to be active after meals so try to leave time to use the bathroom after you eat and before you head out.Ask your healthcare provider about taking along an over-the-counter fiber supplement.Ask your provider if the iron in your prenatal vitamin could be the culprit. High doses of iron  more than 30 milligrams (mg)  can cause constipation or make it worse. As long as you're not anemic, you should be able to take a supplement that contains 30 mg or less of iron.Pregnancy constipation Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:03Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:03Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosHow can I avoid fatigue?It's normal to tire more easily when you're pregnant. Your body is working overtime to support your growing baby. The demands of traveling  along with jet lag from time zone changes and other disruptions to your schedule  will only add to your fatigue.While you can still enjoy many of your favorite vacation activities, you may need to slow your usual pace, keep your schedule light, and give up the idea of seeing everything. Keep your plans as simple as possible, and think quality rather than quantity.Take naps. An afternoon snooze is an especially good way to avoid exhaustion. At your destination, set aside time each day to lie down, close your eyes, and drift off. Even if you can't take a full-fledged nap, pausing periodically during the day to put your feet up can help.Try to spend time outside in the daylight to help reset your biological clock to the new time zone.Keep evening meals light and non-greasy to help ward off the gastrointestinal discomforts that can keep you up at night. Cut back on caffeine and make sure you're drinking enough water to stay well hydrated. To head off middle-of-the-night trips to the bathroom, though, avoid drinking anything two hours before bedtime.Take a warm bath before bed to help you unwind and sleep more soundly.Go to bed as close to your normal bedtime as you can, unless you've crossed at least three time zones. In that case, it's best to try to adjust your sleep schedule to local time to combat jet lag.Lying on your side with a pillow between your knees is usually the most comfortable sleeping position for pregnant women. Keeping your upper body slightly elevated can help counteract heartburn, too.Show sources Hide sources ACG. Undated. Belching, bloating and flatulence.

How to travel successfully with kids (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-travel-successfully-with-kids-ages-5-to-8_67587.bc,"When your children are older, it's time to venture into family destinations and activities more ambitious than the ones your chose when they were preschoolers. Your older child can finally join you in many resort activities, including downhill skiing and snorkeling, as well as typical vacation activities, such as ice skating, fishing, canoeing, and light hiking. Don't try to get too exotic or high-end, though: A funky old cabin near a good swimming lake will thrill most kids as much as a five-star resort would.Before you goLet your children help you plan the trip. ""Your children will probably feel more cooperative and eager if they're allowed to participate in planning the itinerary,"" says Judith Hudson, Ph.D., a child development specialist and associate professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. One easy and reasonable way to include them is to offer two options, such as ""When we visit Aunt Gail in Seattle, would you like to go to the aquarium or see the top of the Space Needle?""Incorporate your child's interests. By the time children reach 5 or 6, they've usually become passionate about something (insects, dinosaurs, dolphins, etc.). Whenever possible, seek out destinations that nurture those interests. For example, the Smithsonian Institution in Washington, D.C., has one of the best insect exhibits in the country. The Wyoming Dinosaur Center offers ""dinosaur digs,"" where participants actually uncover real fossils. At Hawk's Cay Resort in the Florida Keys, children as young as 5 can participate in a dolphin awareness program and even interact with dolphins in the resort's lagoon, under staff supervision.Get outdoors. The most successful destinations for 5- to 8-year-olds are those that offer lots of outdoor activities, whether it's a place with plenty of snow (for fort building or spontaneous snowball fights) or a site with a lot of safe water-play options  swimming, wading, going on water slides. Even if you're locked into a trip to Grandma's condominium, make sure to plan daily excursions to local parks and playgrounds.By age 5 most children can participate in kids' programs at family resorts that teach outdoor skills, such as snorkeling, diving, and skiing. Once children reach 8, they are usually allowed to try out snowboarding, horseback riding, tennis, golf, sailing, and hiking.Establish a home base. Although some kids are more adaptable than others, most find transitions tiring and somewhat stressful, so avoid planning trips that involve a number of changes in hotel and location. Instead, offer your kids a chance to unwind for a few days in one spot. A home base  whether it's a tent, hotel room, or relative's house  gives everyone a chance to relax and process their experiences.When choosing a hotel home base, find out if there's a refrigerator in the room and a grocery nearby. Having a stash of easy-to-fix food at hand offers families mealtime flexibility. Having your own food source is also useful if your child is a picky eater and has a hard time finding restaurant food that he likes.Spring for two rooms. Granted, it saves money to pile everyone into one room with a few double beds. But keep in mind that this means you have to turn off the lights and go to bed when your children do. You may want to compromise by opting for a less expensive hotel and booking adjoining rooms. This way you can read, talk, or watch television while the kids sleep close by. Once you're thereBe flexible. ""Take your cues from your children, just as you would at home,"" says Hudson. ""If they're antsy and irritable, it's probably not a good idea to head for an indoor restaurant or even a tour of an aquarium where they'll be expected to stay in line and keep their voices down."" If they're whiny and poky, think of something restorative  a quiet picnic by a river or an afternoon back at home base, playing cards, reading stories, and eating takeout food. It can be difficult to let go of an agenda, but chances are everyone will be happier if the kids are content.Given the uncertainty and disruption of travel, you may need to relax some of your usual rules.For instance, when Svetlana R. took her 5-year-old to Paris, she didn't insist that her daughter sleep in her own bed as she always does at home. Instead she allowed her travel-weary, jet-lagged child to sleep in the comfort of her parents' bed every night.Keep the children fed and rested. Although it helps to be flexible about your itinerary, Hudson recommends that parents be firm about eating regular meals and getting plenty of sleep. ""Lack of sleep and missing meals can cause children to become cranky and uncooperative  not exactly the spirit you're hoping for on vacation,"" Hudson says. Given the occasional time zone changes and general unpredictability of travel, though, it's easy for children to get off their eating and sleeping schedule, especially when they are older and no longer locked into naps and 8 p.m. bedtimes.Keep some snacks and bottled water in your purse or family travel bag, and at mealtimes, lower your standards if the children are really hungry. Instead of hunting down the ideal healthful restaurant, eat at the golden arches just around the corner.To make sure children settle down to sleep on time, follow the same nighttime routines you keep at home, such as dinner, bath, and story. Don't forget the crucial props to your bedtime routine  a favorite bath toy, a stuffed animal, a book or story tape. Also, children may fall asleep more readily in a strange bed if they have a familiar pillow to rest their weary heads on.Bring along some playtime favorites. While your destination and the activities it offers will be the focus of the trip, pack a few diversions for the family to enjoy.Some suggestions:Trading cards and a display book. Children love sorting and studying these cards. Also, card collections make great icebreakers when your children reunite with cousins or meet new kids at a resort or campground.Playing cards. Five-years-olds can easily play a game of War or Go Fish, and many children can manage more advanced games such as Crazy Eights and even Cribbage by age 8.A chapter book. Read a chapter a day as part of your vacation ritual.A rubber ball for kicking and tossing. Bring out a soft rubber ball (a little larger than a softball) at rest stops, playgrounds, and even empty airport lounges when your children need to burn off energy.Take our poll: Where does your family most often go on summer vacations?"
How to travel successfully with young kids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-travel-successfully-with-young-kids_65302.bc,"Before you goPrepare your child for what he can expect. You may be seeking new and exciting experiences, but small children thrive on familiarity, says Judith Hudson, a child development specialist and associate professor at Rutgers University in New Brunswick, New Jersey. ""My husband and I once vacationed with a couple who brought their two kids along. When it was time for bed the mother pulled out a brand-new red sleeping bag, assuming her 2-year-old would love the novelty of spending the night in it,"" Hudson says. ""But when her son saw his new sleeping bag, he began crying and announced, 'Big red bag  bad. No bed.'""From his perspective it was strange not to sleep in a bed,"" Hudson says, ""and when you're 2 years old, strange usually means bad.""The more you prepare your child for what you know will happen, the more secure he'll feel when facing new surroundings and activities. Whenever possible, let him wear new clothing and try out new vacation gear ahead of time, whether it's a sleeping bag, swimming goggles, a swimsuit, flip-flops, or a snowsuit.Bring along the comforts of home. One of the best ways to help your child settle into a new place is to travel with familiar comfort objects. A favorite book, night-light, pillow (or pillowcase, if you're tight on space), glow-in-the-dark stick-on stars, or even a cool flashlight will help him feel more relaxed in a new environment. A stuffed animal can be a great traveling buddy  just be aware that loveys can get lost. Consider bringing a few new cuddlies and leaving the dearly beloved safe at home.Another crucial item to pack is an umbrella stroller, even if your child no longer uses it when you're at home. Young kids can get extra tired on vacation.Have a home base. Because young children are more content in familiar surroundings, plan a vacation that revolves around one location rather than a trip requiring frequent changes of lodging. Save the whirlwind tour of coastal New England for when your child is older and better able to adjust to change (maybe even to welcome it). Instead, focus on one or two charming seaside towns and plan some interesting day excursions.Choose your campground carefully. If you're a veteran car camper and know basic wilderness safety skills, there's no reason not to take your little one camping. However, you will probably have a more relaxed time if you find a campground that offers a playground, supervised swimming, and a camp store (so you won't be caught without sunscreen and bug spray). Also, make sure the campsite is child-safe  in other words, not near any dangerous drops or bodies of water.Consider a family-friendly resort. Your preschooler probably won't have the strength, skill, or experience to participate in many of the activities at a family resort, such as snorkeling, waterskiing, or downhill skiing. But many family resorts offer excellent beginner programs that playfully introduce young children to these activities. For example, a ski resort might have structured ""snow play"" in which your child could scoot around on small skis for the morning but wouldn't actually ride a chair lift or ski downhill.When evaluating a resort's babysitting services or supervised activities for kids, don't be shy about asking the same questions you might ask a prospective childcare provider back home: What are the credentials of the staff? What is the child-staff ratio? Do they accept children who are still in diapers? Do they provide snacks and meals? What kinds of activities do they offer? Ask for a physical description of the facility or a brochure with pictures. The last thing you want is to count on vacation childcare, only to discover a dingy, depressing hole-in-the-wall. Once you're thereBe flexible. Rigid rules can smother even the best of family vacations. To keep the trip relaxing and to accommodate a restless youngster, for example, consider letting your child sleep in the same bed with you at night. Rather than spending a lot of time preparing a meal or searching for a restaurant that meets your nutritional requirements, loosen your standards a bit and give in to the fast-food restaurant where your child can climb on the outdoor play equipment.Keep it simple. If your child is like most, he thrives in situations where there's plenty of time to explore and move at his own pace. You'll also feel more relaxed if you simply spend time with your child rather than spending lots of money and effort trying to entertain him. My husband and I once took our 3-year-old daughter on an Austrian Christmas vacation, imagining that she would love all the exciting activities we planned, such as a horse-drawn carriage ride through Salzburg and sledding in Innsbruck. While she somewhat enjoyed these excursions, her most joyful moment was when we stumbled on a playground and let her frolic with children her own age. As it turned out, this led to a memorable experience for my husband and me as well: We met an Austrian family at the playground who invited us to their home for dinner.Build in downtime. ""Even if your child no longer takes a nap, remember that traveling can be overwhelming and exhausting for young children,"" says Hudson. When planning an itinerary, avoid locking yourself into a full day of touring New York City or even spending the entire day at a theme park. ""Children in this age group will be much happier if they're given quiet time to process all the stimulation,"" says Hudson. This may mean scheduling an hour of rest back at home base, or simply offering a half-hour snuggle and read-aloud time before going out to dinner. When it comes to bedtime, use the same routines you keep at home, such as dinner, bath, and a story.Get outside. If you're really into sightseeing, choose destinations where your child can roam free. ""While your 3-year-old won't care about the history of a Civil War battleground, he'll certainly love running through the fields and climbing on the cannons,"" says Hudson. Also, try to eat at outdoor restaurants or have picnics whenever possible. Says Hudson, ""Most young children hate having to sit still while they wait for their food to arrive and will appreciate the freedom."""
5 things you should do before giving birth,https://www.babycenter.com/0_5-things-you-should-do-before-giving-birth_10338323.bc,"We asked BabyCenter moms for their top advice on what to do before birth, and they delivered. Here's what they told us:Have your house cleanedA full third of BabyCenter moms we asked said they wished they'd had their house cleaned before the baby's arrival. After all, there's nothing like coming home to a nice clean space. ""My parents paid someone to come clean our house from top to bottom while we were in the hospital,"" one mom said. ""It took so much stress off of us.""Of course, paying for a cleaning service can be expensive. You can also have your partner or a friend or relative help you with some housework and organizing. As one mom said, ""Get as prepared as you can, because you won't have much time to clean once the baby is here.""Prepare foodCooking a meal will likely be the last thing you have time for in the early newborn days. Plan ahead and stock the freezer  28 percent of our moms wished they'd done the same.Those who did stockpile meals were very glad they had. ""I made and froze lots of dinners before the baby arrived  that was a huge help!"" said one mom. ""The slow cooker is your best friend,"" advised another. ""Pre-chop ingredients and store them in the freezer in gallon bags that you can toss into the slow cooker once you have the baby at home.""You may also want to fill the pantry and fridge with convenient snacks like yogurt, cheese sticks, crackers, and granola bars. You'll want snacks handy, and you may not always have time or energy for a full meal. ""There were times I was so tired I forgot to eat,"" one mom said.Birth plan: Your expectations and preferencesLearn about your options for labor, birth, and after, and make your wishes clear.Indulge in a little pamperingPost-childbirth ""pampering"" may mean a five-minute shower during your baby's catnap. So get your real pampering in before labor day. More than a quarter of moms told us they wished they'd gotten a massage or spa treatment before giving birth.Have some funDon't worry, moms do get to enjoy parties and girls' night outs  eventually. But during those first few newborn months? Not so much. So have your fun while you can. And arrange a date night or two  it may be your last chance for romance for a little while. ""Definitely take time for yourself and your partner before the new addition,"" one mom suggests.Find a doctor for your baby""Get a good pediatrician before you have your baby,"" advises one mom  and we agree.

How do I get my toddler on a more routine eating schedule?,https://www.babycenter.com/404_how-do-i-get-my-toddler-on-a-more-routine-eating-schedule_1412798.bc,
Eight smart strategies for pregnant travelers,https://www.babycenter.com/0_eight-smart-strategies-for-pregnant-travelers_6977.bc,"1. Reduce stressThere's one sure way to avoid travel stress while pregnant  stay home for nine months. But what fun is that? With some simple planning strategies, you can reduce your travel anxieties and get the most out of your time on the road, even when raging hormones leave you ready to scream or cry.First, arrange everything you can in advance, including your seat assignment on an airplane (an aisle seat works best for frequent trips to the bathroom), any special meals, and accommodations at your destination.Next, travel light. Ideally, pack only what you can roll on wheels or carry easily with two hands. That way, you won't be stuck if you can't find a porter or a kind stranger, and you won't risk injuring yourself by lifting a load that's too heavy.Bring a carry-on bag with vital supplies, including medications and your phone or tablet, a headset for music, or a good book.When you're ready to go, allow plenty of time to get to the airport, bus, or train station. If you're traveling by car, give yourself ample time for your journey so you don't feel rushed. That leaves a margin for error when inevitable delays occur.Finally, don't forget your patience and sense of humor  they may come in handy when you get stuck on the tarmac or caught in traffic.2. Conserve your energyJust because you're pregnant doesn't mean you can't enjoy an active vacation or take a productive business trip. You can still pursue many of your normal activities, whether they include hiking, visiting museums, or dining out.Just keep in mind that you'll probably tire more quickly than you did before you were pregnant, so don't expect to maintain your usual pace. And remember to make downtime part of your daily schedule whenever possible. Taking a bath, napping, putting your feet up, reading on the beach, and even spending a quiet evening in the hotel and ordering room service can keep you feeling rested and energized throughout your trip. 3. Eat and drink smartWhen you're pregnant, it's doubly important to eat healthful meals regularly. Pack plenty of portable snacks in your carry-on because your eating schedule may be disrupted on the road. Smart choices include nuts, dried fruit, and whole grain crackers with cheese.If you're flying and your airline offers meals, call ahead with any special requests, such as a fruit plate or an option that's gluten-free, diabetes-friendly, or vegetarian. Carry bottled water and drink it regularly, especially on long flights. It's crucial to avoid getting dehydrated, which can be a real challenge in dry airplane cabins.When you arrive at your destination, eat at regular intervals and choose nutritious, well-balanced meals with plenty of fresh fruit, vegetables, and protein. (If you're traveling to a foreign country and aren't sure about the water quality, drink only bottled water. Also remember to avoid uncooked vegetables and eat only fruit that you've peeled yourself.)Always carry healthful, energy-boosting snacks and bottled water in your purse or day pack for when hunger or thirst unexpectedly strikes.If you're having trouble keeping down full meals, or certain foods or smells now turn your stomach, try eating five or six small meals a day. They may go down easier than three big ones, and eating light meals frequently also lowers your chance of heartburn.4. Prepare for pit stopsAs an expectant mom, you're probably running to the bathroom three or four times more often than usual. Airplane facilities are cramped and public restrooms can be dirty, so take advantage of a clean, comfortable bathroom whenever you happen upon one. Even when the facilities are less than luxurious, it's best to play it safe and go with whatever's available because you never know when or where your next opportunity might be.Try to plan ahead as much as possible. Take advantage of highway rest stops or time before boarding the plane to make a preemptive pit stop. When planning your car trip, factor in plenty of time for frequent bathroom breaks.No matter where your trip takes you, it's a good idea to be prepared. Some women find it helpful to pack emergency toilet paper, sanitary wipes, and antibacterial hand cleaner.When flying or taking trains or buses, take the aisle seat so you can get to the restroom without having to climb over other passengers. Seats near the front or rear of the plane are usually closest to the restrooms. 5. Pamper your feet and legsSitting for long periods of time can make your feet and ankles swell and your legs cramp. When you're driving, take breaks every hour to stretch and walk around. If there's an empty seat next to you on a plane, train, or bus, go ahead and put your feet up.When flying, take off your shoes and put on a pair of thick socks or slippers that you can walk around in. Elevate your legs by resting your feet on your carry-on luggage under the seat in front of you. Wear comfortable footwear because your feet will probably swell whether or not you take off your shoes.Pregnancy puts a strain on your circulatory system, which can leave you susceptible to thrombosis (the formation of blood clots) and varicose veins. Sitting for hours in transit when pregnant further increases your risk of clots.Don't stay stationary for extended periods of time  keep your blood circulating by strolling the aisle or getting out of the car every hour and doing some simple stretches every 30 minutes or so. Try this: From a sitting or standing position, extend your leg  heel first  and gently point and flex your foot to stretch your calf muscles. Then, while seated, rotate your ankles and wiggle your toes.If you're prone to varicose veins, wear graduated compression stockings (available at most pharmacies) or maternity support panty hose, which relieve swelling and aching in your legs by strategically compressing the veins to keep blood flowing.For the traveling mom-to-be, nothing is more important than wearing comfortable, supportive footwear. The best shoes or sandals have a contoured footbed to help prevent aches and a thick, skid-resistant sole for good traction and support. Sneakers built for high-impact aerobic sports fit the bill; strappy high heels and mules don't.Bring an extra pair of shoes to give your feet some variety as well as blister pads because even broken-in footwear can rub your feet the wrong way.6. Find out about vaccinationsIf possible, don't go anyplace during your pregnancy where the threat of disease is high, the quality of local healthcare is unreliable, or the safety of food and water is questionable. If you do plan to travel to a country with these circumstances, first talk to your healthcare provider about what vaccines to get. Do this long before your trip  and preferably before you're pregnant.The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) recommends that pregnant women have a prenatal screen for rubella (German measles) and hepatitis B as well as a prenatal assessment for varicella (chicken pox).Generally speaking, pregnant women shouldn't receive live vaccines, such as those for varicella, measles, mumps, and rubella. Because live vaccines are made from live viruses, they could potentially infect you and your unborn baby with the disease.The Centers for Disease Control (CDC) says there's been no reported harm to a fetus from accidentally getting one of these live vaccines. But information is limited, so the CDC also says it's a risk that expectant moms shouldn't take.Once you know which vaccines you need, get live vaccinations at least one month before getting pregnant. Also discuss the benefits and risks of vaccines with inactivated viruses with your healthcare provider.Some other vaccines, such as those for hepatitis B, tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis (whooping cough), are considered safe and are recommended for pregnant women at risk of getting these diseases. Pregnant women who travel to areas where the risk of yellow fever is high should be vaccinated. But the safety of the yellow fever vaccine during pregnancy is unknown, so get it only if travel to an endemic area is unavoidable.For more information, see the CDC's chart listing safe and unsafe vaccines. 7. Prevent yeast infectionsPregnancy makes you susceptible to yeast infections, and yeast grow best in a warm, humid environment.To discourage yeast infections, wear lightweight, loose-fitting, breathable clothing, including all-cotton underwear. Leave the tight jeans and pants at home. After a swim, change out of your wet bathing suit as soon as you can.Before you travel, talk to your healthcare provider about bringing along antifungal cream, just in case.8. Steer clear of risky activitiesThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that pregnant women avoid contact sports as well as those that put you at high risk of falling. That means no snowboarding, skiing, ice skating, horseback riding, waterskiing, or surfing while you're on vacation.Falling is not the only risk  avoid activities that could potentially cause any trauma to your abdomen.Scuba diving is also out because dangerous air bubbles can form in your bloodstream as you surface. Waterslides and many amusement park rides are risky as well  forceful landings and sudden starts and stops can harm your unborn baby.Also, avoid hot tubs because they're usually too hot for pregnant women to use safely. According to ACOG, exposure to high heat and humidity during pregnancy (from sources such as hot tubs and saunas) is linked to a higher risk of neural tube defects.But you don't have to spend your vacation sitting on the sidelines. If you're a healthy woman with an uncomplicated pregnancy, your doctor will probably advise you to stay active and get regular exercise during your trip.A final note about traveling: Listen to your body. If you feel overtired, overheated, or just plain uncomfortable, stop what you're doing and take a break.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2011. Exercise during pregnancy.

7 new strategies for feeding a picky eater,https://www.babycenter.com/0_7-new-strategies-for-feeding-a-picky-eater_10360322.bc,"1. Jazz up the presentationIt may not be logical, but kids think brussels sprouts taste better when they can pluck them off the stalk rather than pick them out of a pile. And they find fruit more flavorful when it's skewered like a kabob instead of heaped in a bowl.So think presentation as well as nutrition. You don't have to be a gourmet chef to put together a snazzy, kid-friendly plate. It can be as simple as arranging cut-up veggies on a colorful platter and sticking in some toothpicks, or serving a fruit smoothie in a pretty glass instead of in your child's regular old tooth-marked mug.Why it works: ""We eat with our eyes,"" say Liz Weiss and Janice Bissex, nutritionists and authors of No Whine With Dinner: 150 Healthy, Kid-Tested Recipes From the Meal Makeover Moms. If food looks good, our mouths water before we even taste it, lowering our resistance. For kids  who tend to be not only choosy but also sensitive to the way things look  this goes double.Picky eaters (Mom Confidential) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:18Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:18Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Go family-styleIt may be tempting to dish up your child's plate at the stove  that way you can make sure he gets the correct portions. But according to Emma Waverman, coauthor of Whining & Dining: Mealtime Survival for Picky Eaters and the Families Who Love Them, letting your child serve himself can help reduce his pickiness.Important: No short-order cooking! Instead, try to include in each meal at least one dish that even your choosiest eater will accept. And if he skips over the salmon and broccoli and serves himself only bread? Take a deep breath and resist the urge to whip him up a bowl of buttered noodles. Let him enjoy the family dining experience his own way, and try to keep your own worry about his nutrition out of it.Why it works: Letting your child be his own boss at dinner (without catering to him through short-order cooking) removes the fight factor. When meals are dominated by parental cajoling, forcing, or bribing, it makes for a tense environment  and kids balk at the pressure. On the other hand, when mealtime is pleasant and stress-free, kids begin to relax and are more likely to take risks by trying something new.As Waverman puts it, ""Try to make dinner time appealing on an emotional level as well as on a food level."" After days of sticking to carbs, your child may surprise you by venturing into protein-and-veggie land all on his own.If you don't see an improvement, discuss it with your child (but never at the dinner table). ""You can tell him you've noticed he only eats rice and bread at dinner, and you can give some gentle education on what a more balanced meal looks like,"" says Waverman. Finally, ask for his input  he may have an idea for a healthy side dish or two. Of course, if it's his idea, he'll be more likely to try it.3. Try using a food chainFeeding specialist Cheri Fraker, coauthor of Food Chaining: The Proven 6 Step Solution to Stop Picky Eating, Solve Feeding Problems, and Expand your Child's Diet, explains her food chain technique this way: Picky eaters are slowly and gradually offered foods that are very similar to ones they already accept. Gradually, they learn to expand their menus.For example, if your child likes a certain brand of French fries, offer her a similar brand. After she accepts different kinds of fries, move on to a food that's similar in taste and texture, such as baked potato puffs. Once she accepts this, move on to a baked potato. Follow this with mashed potatoes, then mashed potatoes with gravy, then potato pot pie, and finally, quiche.Why it works: Food chaining is customized to your child's preferences, and the pace is as slow as she needs it to be. This will help her feel comfortable with trying new foods. ""When it comes to eating, children balk at pressure,"" says Fraker. ""This technique adapts to them, rather than forcing them to adapt to a technique.""4. Let them get hungryKids have become grazers, expecting a near-constant supply of juice boxes and crackers. Dinner  where more nutritious food is served  can become an afterthought. ""Don't be afraid to let your kids get a little hungry before mealtime,"" says Betsy Hicks, coauthor of Picky Eating Solutions.This doesn't mean they shouldn't have any snacks. After all, with their rapid growth and small stomachs, children do need to eat between meals. But there's a difference between providing moderate snacks and letting food serve as your children's primary boredom-buster.If you find your kids demanding one snack after another, get them involved in an art project, take them out for a walk, or break out the sidewalk chalk. The likely result? Mealtime will become more satisfying. ""There's immense joy in sitting down to a table when you're hungry,"" says Hicks. ""I think a lot of today's children don't get to have that experience.""Why it works: Kids are more likely to eat different types of food if they're hungry, even foods that scare them a little. ""Think about what it would take for you to eat a worm, as they do in some parts of Asia,"" says Hicks. ""It would be scary to you  just as broccoli is scary to some kids  but you'd certainly be more likely to try it if your stomach was empty.""5. Lose the self-blameWhen you see your friend's kid wolfing down spinach and sushi, as your own slowly chews half a slice of bread, it's easy to judge yourself. But remember, pickiness is a trait like any other. ""It's so important not to blame yourself,"" says Emily Rosenbaum, author of Cooking on the Edge of Insanity and the mother of a picky eater. ""Picky eating is not the fault of the parents!""Why it works: Once you shed the self-blame, you can gently help your child stretch his tastes without infusing the process with your own stress. This will free you up to cook with your child's tastes in mind without catering to him completely. Most crucial, you can begin to celebrate and enjoy food with him, rather than viewing it as a measure of your inadequacy. He'll pick up on your attitude, which will help him relax.6. Start the day strongIf you've ever stuffed a granola bar into your child's hand or tossed her a toaster pastry as you both dive into the car in the mad morning rush, you know that breakfast can get short shrift. If this is the case in your home, try giving more priority to the first meal of the day. The options are endless  and not necessarily time consuming. Think fresh fruit, yogurt, low-sugar granola, eggs, and smoothies.Why it works: ""Children who eat a nutritious breakfast tend to make better food choices for the rest of the day,"" says Elizabeth Pantley, author of The No-Cry Picky Eater Solution: Gentle Ways to Encourage Your Child to Eat  and Eat Healthy. It's as if they kick-start themselves on a ""less picky"" path. Plus, kids who eat breakfast have better overall health than those who don't.7. Not working? Consider professional helpSome kids are picky eaters because of a developmental or medical issue, says Linda Piette, pediatric nutritionist and author of Just Two More Bites: Getting Picky Eaters to Say Yes to Food. If your child's picky eating is affecting his health, causing a lot of conflict in your home, or seems particularly severe (or if you're simply at your wit's end and want some professional backup), it's time to talk to your child's doctor. She can refer you to a feeding specialist or nutritionist.Why it works: A feeding therapist or nutritionist can provide an evaluation to help get to the root of the problem and will then develop a customized plan to address it. For example, some children have sensory issues that make them resistant to certain textures, and therapy can help them learn to ways to adapt. ""I have seen countless children get better with treatment,"" says Piette."
Kitchen confidential: Mealtime secrets from top chef parents,https://www.babycenter.com/0_kitchen-confidential-mealtime-secrets-from-top-chef-parents_1471534.bc,"The situation looks grim. After yet another action-packed day juggling everything from work and chores to school and afternoon activities, it's time for dinner. You suddenly realize you have no hope of getting a well-balanced, wholesome meal on the table. There isn't a vegetable in the house. No hearty leftovers hidden away in the fridge. And yes, as the nursery rhyme goes, even your cupboard is bare.Then comes the familiar witching-hour refrain: ""I'm starving. I need to eat now!"" So you guiltily reach into your kitchen cabinet and pull out that frazzled-parent standby, a box of mac 'n' cheese, vowing that one of these days you'll get your act together on the food front.Help is on the way. For advice, we turned to the consummate experts: Award-winning chefs who also happen to be busy moms and dads themselves. Like you, these food folk face the what's-for-dinner dilemma on a daily basis. But the chef parents we spoke with have what many of us are hungry for: culinary tips and tricks for whipping up healthy, tasty meals in as little time as it takes you to boil water.Rick Bayless: Dad of child with dietary restrictionsHome: ChicagoRestaurants: Frontera Grill and Topolobampo, in ChicagoChild: Lanie, 14By the time Rick's daughter, Lanie, was 5, he realized she was developing a significant wheat and dairy allergy. ""Foods with milk or wheat flour made her really sniffly and uncomfortable,"" Rick recalls. A renowned chef specializing in regional Mexican cuisine, Rick's immediate challenge was to create meals the whole family could enjoy. His solutions: dishes with spelt flour, goat's milk, and goat's cheese so delicious even non-allergic eaters rave. The experience led father and daughter to eventually collaborate on a cookbook: Rick and Lanie's Excellent Kitchen Adventures. ""Lanie's food needs became a real bonding experience for our family. We still love to make meals with spelt pasta."" Rick, who packs lunch most days for his now-teenaged daughter, happily reports she outgrew her allergy and now eats pretty much everything.Mollie Katzen: The kids' cookbook queenHome: Berkeley, CaliforniaCookbooks: Pretend Soup and Other Real Recipes, The Moosewood Cookbook, Honest Pretzels, Salad People, among othersChildren: Sam, 21, and Eve, 14Raised on Minute Rice, Campbell's soups, Velveeta, and frozen vegetables, Mollie didn't taste a fresh green vegetable until she was  gasp  12 years old. The bestselling cookbook author has been making up for lost time ever since. Vegetarian eating is at the core of her wholesome cuisine. ""To be honest, though, sometimes the last thing I want to do after a long day in my test kitchen trying to perfect a vinaigrette or a lemon curd tart recipe is to spend more time in the kitchen fixing dinner,"" she confesses. ""Sometimes all I want to do is go out and have Chinese food with my family.""Laura and David Shea: The family restaurateursHome: Brooklyn, New YorkRestaurant: ApplewoodChildren: Sophie, 5, and Tatum, 16 monthsWhen starting their own restaurant became a serious topic at the dinner table, Laura could initially only see the negatives for their young kids: the crazy hours, absentee parents, and few chances for family meals. Not anymore. ""I've discovered there probably isn't a more nurturing environment to grow up in than a place filled with the sights, sounds, smells, and tastes of food,"" says Laura, who wore her youngest in a sling every night on the job until the baby was almost 8 months old. ""The restaurant is like a first home to our kids because we're here so much, and the staff is like a second family. Now we always tell people it takes a restaurant to raise a child.""Todd English: The single parentHome: BostonRestaurants: 17 worldwide, including Olives, his signature spot in BostonChildren: Oliver, 15, Isabelle, 12, and Simon, 9Feeding three kids is no mean feat, especially if your life also includes traveling the globe to manage multiple restaurants and starring in hit TV food shows like Iron Chef America and Cooking Under Fire. So whenever he can, Todd gets his three kids to help out in the kitchen. That's not a hard sell, he says, because children love the physicality of, well, playing with their food. ""When your kids are younger, they really have a lot of fun baking. They love to get their hands in the dough,"" says Todd. ""Now that mine are older, I like watching them make their own decisions about what's going into the chili we make. I like to see them get creative.""Gayle Pirie and John Clark: The two-chef familyHome: Berkeley, CaliforniaRestaurant: Foreign Cinema, in San FranciscoChildren: Magnus, 7, and Pearl, 6 monthsPizza, ice cream, and oysters for kids? No, it's not a joke. But that's exactly what these critically acclaimed chef parents served 23 first graders when their son Magnus and his class visited their restaurant. ""We didn't think many kids would get on board,"" admits Gayle. ""But we talked about the beauty of an oyster: It's salty, briny, and prepares your palate for what's next. It's a clean-tasting, living thing  an oyster is pretty exciting to eat  like surfing in the water."" At first, no one took the plunge. Then one brave 6-year-old stepped forward. ""And that was it. After that, every single child  and some skeptical parents  tried an oyster. We must have gone through over a hundred oysters that day.""Michael Chiarello: The second-time-around dadHome: St. Helena, CaliforniaRestaurant: Founder of Tra Vigne, in Napa ValleyChildren: Margaux, 21, Felicia, 18, Giana, 14, and a baby boy on the wayMichael grew up in California's farm-rich Central Valley in a clan with Southern Italian ties  homemade food was at the heart of family life. Michael passed this passion on to his own daughters. ""My girls spent hours in the kitchen with me when they were younger,"" recalls the host of the Food Network's Easy Entertaining and author of At Home With Michael Chiarello. ""The moment I knew they were really savoring food was when my daughter Margaux said, 'Daddy, this tomato is so ripe you can smell the taste of it.'"" No longer tied to a restaurant kitchen, Michael is content to meet the quirky dinner demands of his pregnant wife. ""Eileen calls from the road to let me know she's on her way, she's really hungry, and she wants dinner ready when she walks in the door,"" he jokes. ""Sometimes she's craving protein, other days she's desperate for greens. I usually have a couple of things cooking so I can switch gears. It's all about whatever Mama needs right now.""Chef Tip: Plan aheadLaura: On my day off, I try to cook some things that can carry us through the week. The dish that I probably get the biggest bang for my buck out of is meatloaf. I make it with organic ground beef, finely chopped onion, some tomato bisque, bread crumbs, eggs, fresh herbs, lemon juice, and salt and pepper. The kids can eat it one night for dinner, then I'll slice it for sandwiches for lunch or crumble it over noodles for another meal. We've even been known to give meatloaf to the girls with eggs for breakfast instead of sausages.Michael: Ask your local pizzeria if they'll sell you some pizza dough  they're usually more than happy to charge three bucks for something that costs about three cents to make. If this is a new idea to them, offer to buy a dozen balls and freeze a stash for later use.Rick: I rely a lot on a slow cooker. I put it on in the morning before I leave and then dinner is done by the time I get home. I use it for making perfect beans and for braising meat without going through the traditional time-consuming ingredient preparation in many Mexican recipes. I also recommend using a rice cooker. You can put it on in advance, there's no need to think about temperature adjustments, it cooks rice perfectly, and it keeps the rice warm and ready to eat for a long time, so you don't have to time the rest of the meal around the rice.Mollie: Shopping well is 99 percent of getting tasty, healthy meals on the table in a hurry. Buy pastas already stuffed with pesto, or find flavor-baked tofu. That way, you have some seasoning to work with already. Pick up organic frozen vegetables  you can get some good ones now  like spinach, broccoli, and artichokes. Get skinned, pre-pounded chicken breasts that are good to go. They need just a few minutes in a hot skillet.Stock your refrigerator with some cooked whole grains and healthy grain alternatives that you can easily reheat, such as whole-wheat couscous and quinoa. The same goes for beans, which, like grains, take a long time to cook but require very little work.A few times a week, spend 15 minutes cleaning and chopping vegetables and salad greens. Then store them in sealed plastic bags so they're ready for a fast saut or salad another night. Make a couple of sauces that keep when you have some downtime, so you can turn plain steamed vegetables, baked potatoes, or rice and beans into a lovely light meal.Chef Tip: Stock up on staplesMichael: Work on your list of ""speed scratch"" ingredients  high-quality items like stocks, spice rubs, olive oils, jarred marinara sauces, or premade pesto that can add flavor fast if you're pushed for time. These are what I call my pantry essentials; they take a basic like pasta, chicken, or ground meat, and turn it into an interesting meal.Mollie: In my pantry I keep a lot of canned organic beans  pinto, black, red kidney, and chick-peas. These come in handy for tacos, quesadillas, and burritos. I also use them in a bean dip  black beans, lime, garlic, ground cumin, salt, and tomato juice  smushed up in a food processor, which kids seem to like. Most bean-based chili, soups, and casseroles freeze beautifully. Make a big batch on the weekend and freeze in several smaller containers. Take out a tub before you go to work or start your day and it will be ready to heat and eat when you get home.John: In the freezer, I keep Japanese gyoza (dumplings), filled with chicken, pork, or shrimp, and edamame (soybeans) for quick protein fixes. When Magnus is running on empty, to function and feel good he needs protein, which sustains him in a way that carbohydrates don't. So it's nice to have organic peanut butter, raw almonds, and pumpkin seeds  all good protein sources  on hand as well.Chef Tip: Keep it simpleRick: To really help in a time crunch, you can find sliced, precut vegetables or salad bar selections at the grocery store and keep them in your fridge in resealable plastic bags. Then pick one-pot meals like stir-fry that cut down on your cooking time. I use a very large skillet so I can fit everything in and cook it evenly and quickly. My daughter, Lanie, loves pad thai (which is Thai for stir-fry)  rice noodles, tofu, eggs, green onions, and mung bean sprouts in a sweet-and-sour sauce cooked fast in a wok. It's good cold for lunch the next day. And the sauce  garlic, sugar, ketchup, chili flakes, and rice vinegar mixed in a blender  can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a month. I make double or triple the recipe so it's ready for an emergency pad thai fix.Gayle: We don't do gourmet meals in our home, but we still eat well. One of our favorites is to make tacos with all-organic ingredients: ground beef, canned tomato sauce, and taco shells. We brown the meat with a southwestern taco seasoning my son likes, add the sauce, heat the taco shells  that's it. And we serve them with julienned romaine lettuce, diced tomatoes, sliced avocado, jack cheese, and sour cream. My son loves tacos because he gets to decide just how much stuff goes in them, maybe he adds a little more meat or goes easy on the sour cream. Kids love to eat what they make  and to have a say in what they eat.Michael: Don't try to get creative when you don't have time, but stick with the eight to ten dishes that you have mastered. Over time, they will become stress-free and second nature. It's good to have a couple of pastas, a roast chicken recipe, a stir-fry or two, an egg dish, and some soups in the mix. My wife, Eileen, keeps recipes for her standard meals on 3x5 cards held together with a clip. On the back she writes the list of ingredients for going to the store and any notes about making the meal she wants to remember.Chef Tip: Go back to the sourceMollie: The farmers' market was a revelation to my daughter, Eve. When a farmer first plucked a little plum out of a basket and handed it to her to sample, that was a big moment for her. It was an unusual sugar plum  dark on the outside and an odd, elongated finger-shape. When she bit into it, the plum was bright yellow. The farmer told her that he'd picked it from his tree that morning. She was enchanted.I also recommend going with other families. Sometimes a little peer pressure is a good thing  another child may get your kid to try something he hasn't tasted before.Rick: We have a big garden full of different kinds of lettuces, herbs, heirloom tomatoes, Swiss chard, apple trees, strawberries, and raspberries. Growing our own food has just been a regular part of Lanie's life. Since she was little, she's harvested stuff like edible flowers. One of the first games she played was restaurant. She'd be outside taking orders, serving food, and ""cooking"" things from the garden for us. It's made her aware of the rhythm of the seasons, and how hard it sometimes is to get that stuff out of the ground. Even if all you have time and room for is a window box, it's great to grow herbs like basil, chives, and thyme so your child can snip a few fresh sprigs to add to what's cooking.Laura: My daughter Sophie has a real sense of connectedness to the farming community because we know the local farmers and go to their farms. Many children think that food originates from the supermarket shelf, so it's important to show them where it really comes from and teach them to care about the environment it's grown in. Pick-your-own berry or apple farms are a great way to get your child out in the field. You can even go a step further and make preserves with the fruit. If they're big PB&J fans, they'll appreciate knowing where that jelly came from.Chef Tip: Invite the kids into the kitchenTodd: Preparing meals with your kids is a great way to get them to expand their palates. Kids get to know the food and feel some ownership in what's cooking  and in eating it.Mollie: Young children need some elbowroom in the kitchen. Use a several-sizes-larger-than-you'd-think mixing bowl. It can make all the difference in your child's confidence. Set up ahead of time and have everything in easy reach, so you can focus on cooking. When making pizza, for instance, it helps to put ingredients  like grated cheese, chopped olives, and sliced zucchini  in shallow containers arranged in a row on a low table. Have a sense of humor about spills. I tell kids they're what sponges are for.Michael: Getting kids involved early in the kitchen helps pique their interest in new foods. When they're very young even giving them a fake job  like stirring a bowl of small potatoes  lets them have fun and allows you to cook.John: Don't kick your kids out of the kitchen because you think it will be faster and less hassle without them around. They get so much pleasure from helping make meals, and it may spark a lifelong interest in food. My son loves to squeeze lemons with a juicer and pop things in the oven wearing potholders, just like we do in the restaurant. And you need to let them do these things  with supervision, of course. He cleans up after himself, too, because he understands it's all part of the cooking process.Chef Tip: Please a picky eaterMollie: I find most kids have one or two things they absolutely love and they don't mind having over and over. There's nothing wrong with that as long as it has protein, vegetables, and some complex carbohydrates. If you've got that, then you've got a balanced meal.But if your child is set on one thing  say plain pasta  then you can try to improve the nutrition profile a bit. Try switching to whole-grain pasta. There are some great ones out there now that taste really good. Or maybe you could add a little pesto to it and make green spaghetti.Laura: Sophie will sometimes say something random like ""I don't like chicken"" when that's not the case. Our set response is, ""This is what we have for dinner. You have to taste it. If you like it, you can eat lots of it. And if you don't like it, you don't have to eat any more."" We don't make her eat anything she doesn't like.Once, Sophie got stuck in a PB&J rut and didn't want anything else for lunch. So first I started varying the butter. I'd use almond or pumpkin butter and then substituted a different kind of fruit spread or type of bread. I've found that branching out by offering something similar can help move them out of a phase.Todd: Kids' palates change all the time, so don't hesitate to rotate that grilled tuna or baked chicken back into the mix. You'll never know unless you try. The kid who has regularly shunned chicken might take a liking to it.Rick: There's no point making food a battleground. When Lanie was little, one of the few things we knew she'd eat when we went out was romaine lettuce and salmon  go figure. In general, we found there was enough she liked that we could work around her pickiness. For some parents it's real torture to live through their kids' eating only pasta with butter and cheese. But you'll find that around the time they hit puberty, kids grow out of fussy food stuff almost overnight.Chef Tip: Sneak in new foodsMollie: Nothing inspires vegetable appreciation more than a yummy dip, full of fresh herbs or creamy textures  like a homemade version of ranch dressing that's healthy and takes five minutes to make. Children love to scoop up dips with crunchy sugar snap peas, cucumber spears, sweet bell pepper pieces, and baby carrots. They literally dig in.Laura: There's something about making the ingredients in a pureed soup  all foamy and smooth  that appeals to kids. They often go for something they might not ordinarily try. Try making butternut squash soup with a hint of maple syrup or French green lentils with bacon or roasted parsnip soup, which is sweet on its own.Rick: If you're introducing something new, offer just a taste, mix it in with something familiar your child likes, and play around with the flavors until the dish is nicely balanced  this is the key to all good cooking. Let's face it, many vegetables, on their own, have a bitter taste. So you've got to balance out those flavors with something creamy or sweet. There's a reason lots of kids like broccoli with cheese.Mollie: You can craftily introduce new foods by creating characters  I call them salad people  out of pieces of cheese, fruit, vegetables, and curly pasta (great for hair). Provide the inspiration: cottage cheese, pear halves, peas, celery sticks stuffed with nut butter, sliced honeydew, small spinach leaves, parsley sprigs, radish rounds, raisins, cherry tomatoes. Then let your child take the lead.Chef Tip: Make time for family mealsLaura: We all eat at home together on Sundays and Mondays when the restaurant is closed. And we all eat the same thing. In fairness to the kids, we're not going to serve sea urchin or pozole (traditionally made from a pig's head), something I know they're not up for. Our current favorite is spaghetti and meatballs because both girls love it. I make the meatballs really tiny so our youngest,Tatum, is able to get a fork into them and feed herself with great success, which is really important to her right now. I just put half the meat mixture aside for us, and add some wine, garlic, and onion so it's more our speed.Michael: When my daughters were younger, we never served them separate meals. I wasn't raised that way either. My mother would put aside some pasta sauce, meat, or soup for the kids before finishing it with final spices or ingredients for the adults. It's important to eat together and put the food on the table in front of the kids so they see the other things you eat too. Kids get exposed to a lot of foods this way and tend to develop a palate for them. I make a pasta-potato dish that's quite spicy. It has chili paste in it, so I'd just omit that ingredient for the kids. My youngest girl doesn't like mushrooms, so if we're doing a stir-fry, we'll just cook the mushrooms first, set them aside, and add them to the adult version at the end.Rick: I sit down to breakfast every day with my wife and daughter. We have our little rituals, like lighting a candle and talking about what we're doing that day. During the week we have yogurt and granola, and on the weekends we might make a potato-bacon frittata (oven-baked omelet) or a Dutch Baby (a puffy, oven-cooked pancake with fresh fruit and syrup). We eat well, but it's nothing fancy. It's just a special time because we're all together as a family."
14 ways to save on family food bills,https://www.babycenter.com/0_14-ways-to-save-on-family-food-bills_1497525.bc,"Scouting around in the family budget for quick savings? You may not be able to reduce your mortgage or rent overnight, but you can reduce your food bills quickly and easily with these cost-busting ideas.Seven shopping tricks1. Shop alone  and after eatingOne simple recipe for avoiding impulse buying: Do your shopping after a light snack or meal and leave the kids at home.If you aren't hungry, yummy-looking foods will be easier to pass up. And if your children aren't with you, they won't be clamoring for all the goodies at eye level.With your stomach full and your hands free, you'll find yourself with both the time and energy to do real comparison shopping. So have your partner or another adult stay with the kids while you head to the store, list in hand, ready to scan the aisles for what you need as well as special deals.2. Understand how stores workA basic understanding of merchandising can help you avoid overspending. These simple habits will go a long way toward keeping your budget in check:Walk briskly toward what you came to buy and avoid distractions along the way. For example, have you ever noticed that the diapers and milk are often at the back of the store? You're forced to walk past a lot of temptation to get to the items you need most often.Products are displayed at the ends of the aisles to catch your eye. Think carefully about whether what you see there is really necessary or a bargain before you toss it in the cart. Many ""featured"" items are not bargains at all.As you peruse the aisles, bend over to check the prices on the bottom shelves and compare them with the cost of the items at eye level.Avoid buying the items displayed by the register. The magazines at the checkout stand cost much more per issue than they would if you had a subscription, and cookies in little packages cost more than a from a box. Almost everything near the register is there to inspire you to buy on impulse, not to save you money.Tip: Make fewer trips to the store and you'll find yourself with fewer chances to pick up a few extras you don't really need.3. Buy house brands or genericsThe less costly house brands are often so similar to national brands that you wouldn't be able to tell them apart without the packaging. Read labels to compare nutritional value and you'll quickly see how little difference (if any) there is other than price.Store brands cost an average of 27 percent less than name brands, according to Consumer Reports, which looked at 29 different food categories. Testers said store brands tasted the same or better in all but six categories.Meat and dairy products all have to meet government standards, so store brands should be just as wholesome and nutritious as national brands.Tip: You can donate to your child's school as you shop. This costs you nothing just sign up for the school's scrip or electronic scrip fundraising program. Participating stores then donate part of the value of your purchase to the school every time you shop. To find out more, ask at your child's school.4. Check the unit priceDon't be fooled by packaging. As you cruise down the aisles comparing products, take note of the unit price that appears on the store shelf just below or above the product. The unit price tells you what the product costs per ounce or some other consistent unit of measurement.Whether the package is tall, short, or squat, you'll know in an instant whether it costs more or less than other sizes of the same food. Compare per-unit prices and buy the item that offers more for less instead of the one that looks like more for less.5. Use savings cards and couponsCheck your supermarket's weekly flyer or ads for coupons on items you buy regularly, but also take advantage of your store's savings card.Many supermarkets offer savings-card programs that entitle you to special bargains or cash-back dividends on your purchases. Just present the savings card (or your ID number) at checkout, and depending on how your store's program is structured, you'll get savings on the spot or a dividend at the end of the year.Keep your clipped coupons organized, perhaps separated according to grocery aisle or section. Whether you choose to hold them in envelopes, in a zip-top bag, with paper clips, or in a specially designed accordion file, store them in your purse or car so they're with you whenever you shop. It's annoying to come home from food shopping and find the coupon you wanted on the counter on your store's triple coupon day.Tip: If a sale item doesn't appear on the shelves, ask for a rain check so you can get it for the reduced price when it's back in stock.6. Buy in bulkBuying in bulk is a no-brainer if you're feeding a big family or the whole preschool. But you can still benefit from these discounts if yours is a smaller family or you have limited storage space. Here are some ideas for making the most of oversize buys:As always, arrive at your bulk-shopping store with a list. This will help you avoid buying a TV, watch, barbecue, or package of 200 gel pens just because it's such a good deal.Buy mostly nonperishable items that you know for sure you'll use eventually for example, paper products, cleaning supplies, baby wipes, juice boxes, and canned goods.If you do purchase perishables, separate large packages into smaller ones as soon as you get home. Divide chicken and steaks, for example, into daily portions and freeze for later use.Split the purchases and the bill with another family. Again, a list is a must agree ahead of time on what you'll buy. If you trade off trips to the store, both families also save time.7. Buy from the sourceGet produce from a local farmer's market and you may be able to avoid the store markup on fresh vegetables and fruit, especially if you buy organic. Keep an eye out at the farmer's market for growers selling blemished produce at bargain prices it tastes wonderful but doesn't meet grocery store standards for beauty.Some farmer's markets carry locally produced meat and dairy products, locally caught fish, and a variety of prepared sauces, preserves, and condiments made by local food artisans that would cost much more in stores. Of course, these are expensive no matter where you buy them. But if they're must-haves for your family, a farmer's market may be your best bet. Four planning tricks1. Buy in seasonBlueberries can cost $2 a pint or $6 a pint, depending on whether you buy them in June or January. The price of lettuce, tomatoes, avocadoes, and other fruits and vegetables also varies by season (and sometimes by the weather, as droughts and other extremes shrink crops and raise prices).Plan your menus around what's in season in your area, and you'll avoid paying extra for produce that's imported from faraway places with different growing seasons. If you're a once-a-week shopper, plan to use these freshest ingredients in the first few days, choosing recipes with less perishable ingredients for later in the week.If you regularly throw out produce that's well past its prime, consider buying canned or frozen fruits and vegetables instead. If packaged at their peak of freshness, without added salt or sugar, they're as nutritious as fresh and their staying power makes them more economical.Tip: Frugal shoppers know they can get a price break by buying day-old bread or bagels. And you can make a game of cooking fine foods with produce you picked up at a bargain price just before it became over-ripe. But try reversing the strategy by buying only the freshest items, and they'll last longer in your refrigerator.Find out when the market gets its fish deliveries, for example, and buy fish on that day. You'll find yourself tossing less spoiled food into the trash, often saving dollars at a time.2. Plan for the weekTake some time before you head for the store to plan the week's meals. Make a list and stick to it.Knowing what's in season, plan your meals around what you'll find at the best price this week. Then take things a step further and do as our grandmothers did: Get a roast or a ham, serve it on Sunday, slice it for sandwiches on Monday, and toss in a few veggies to turn the leftovers into a stew or soup on Tuesday.Tip: Avoid throwing away leftover food. Dry bread can morph into croutons, bread pudding, stuffing, or pappa al pomodoro (Italian bread and tomato soup). A peeled banana stored in the freezer can be transformed into next week's banana bread or whirled in the blender with milk and frozen strawberries to make a smoothie a healthy, inexpensive snack for kids and adults. Leftover vegetables can become hearty soups or stews, and even one serving of last night's pasta can be packed up as today's lunch for your hungry preschooler.3. Grow your ownFresh herbs can cost a pretty penny at the grocery store, and many recipes call for such a small amount that most of the bundle gets tossed into the refrigerator for later. Unfortunately, ""later"" seldom seems to come, and the herbs are often rediscovered when it's too late for them to be used.Why not grow your own in sweet little pots on your kitchen window ledge? When a recipe calls for it, you can pinch off a bit of basil, dill, thyme, or chives. And in the meantime, the herb plants will decorate your kitchen nicely.Similarly, tomatoes and many other fruits and vegetables are easy to grow in containers. Some, like certain lettuces and cabbages, are so pretty, they're ornamental too. Strawberries have charming flowers and foliage. So if you have a yard, deck, or even just a small, sunny balcony, you can turn a little sunshine and water into both a garden oasis and grocery savings. Check your local library for books on container gardening.4. Enjoy romantic dinners at homeLonging for a dreamy evening with your partner but loath to spring for a pricey restaurant? With a little forethought, you can feed the baby, put her down for the night, and cook yourselves a gourmet meal at home. What you save on a babysitter you can spend on special ingredients. Three cooking tricks1. Cook and freezeDouble the recipe of that casserole, stew, or lasagna or make twice as much cookie dough and pop half into the freezer for the future. It's cheaper to buy ingredients in bulk, so you'll save time and money.Tip: Don't have much freezer space? Form a dinner co-op with another family. Each family chooses one day a week to make a double batch of whatever's for dinner, and the other family picks up their share that night. Both families save time and have a night off cooking without the extra expense of takeout food.2. Make it from scratchThe price of a homemade cake is minimal, compared with a bakery cake, and your own pot roast and special lasagna are almost certainly tastier and less expensive than store-bought versions. Delicious one-dish dinners can be created using your own noodles, tomato products and spices rather than the contents of a single box. But that doesn't mean that you should make everything from scratch.Bottled salad dressing definitely costs more than tossing your salad with oil and vinegar, but some products, like mayonnaise, are tricky and time consuming to make. Others, like spaghetti sauce, cost less if you purchase a jarred version on sale than if you buy all the ingredients and cook them up. (On the other hand, if you grow your own tomatoes, homemade spaghetti sauce becomes a cheap staple.)Tip: Buy a small food processor or baby-food mill and puree leftovers or freshly cooked food into healthy, tasty baby food. Not only does this cost less than jarred baby food, but you can gradually introduce your baby to the flavors that are favorites with your family.3. Eat meat sparingly (or not at all)The priciest portion of most Americans' diets is meat. And nutritionists continue to urge us all to eat more vegetables. You can reduce expenses and build nutritious habits at the same time simply by introducing some vegetarian entrees into your cooking repertoire.Start slowly, maybe by introducing one meatless meal per week. Many families  and even some schools  favor ""meatless Mondays."" Try a vegetable-loaded lasagna, serve bean-filled tacos, or make a stir-fry with marinated tofu (peanut sauce makes a great marinade for young palates) and your family's favorite vegetables.As your family becomes more comfortable with less meat, experiment with other delicious vegetarian entrees. It might take some extra thought to prepare dishes that pack plenty of iron and protein, but your grocery bill will soon look a lot less beefy."
Cooking with kids (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_cooking-with-kids-ages-5-to-8_1433902.bc,"Enlisting your child's help in the kitchen has many advantages: Cooking is a fun way to bond, builds self-esteem and confidence, and helps your child develop a healthy attitude about food. And the more your child helps in the kitchen now, the more likely he'll help out as he gets older.How can you make pint-size kitchen duty enjoyable for everyone? Start with these tips:Supervise, of course. And be sure you're the one to handle the more dangerous duties, like using sharp knives and turning on the oven or stove.Set clear rules about kitchen safety. Teach your child to tie back long hair and to wash her hands before getting started and after handling raw meat or eggs. Similarly, make sure your child knows it's unsafe to nibble cookie dough or cake batter that has raw eggs in it.For things that are safe to sample, have your taste tester use a clean spoon that goes into the sink, not back into the bowl.Let your child know what jobs are safe for her to do and which ones are for a grown-up to do (like turning on the stove and using knives).Dress the part. Tie a small apron around your child or dress him in an old shirt. You can even go all out and get him his own chef's hat and apron. This not only keeps him clean, it adds to his sense of ceremony about the work at hand.Make it meaningful. Ask your child what she'd like to make  cooking things your child likes to eat helps convey the idea that food is pleasurable and preparing it is fun. Or make a favorite recipe from your childhood and share a story about why you love it.You could even prepare a dish from another culture  maybe from a place your child has read about or learned about in school  and take the opportunity to learn a word in a foreign language or find the country on a map.Work at his level. Let your child sit on a stool or chair to reach the counter or move the work to a lower table.Show your child how to measure. Your child can measure things like water or milk, dry ingredients, and spices. Rather than letting her measure ingredients directly into the pot or bowl you'll be using, have her put them into small bowls (the way they do on cooking shows).That way, if your child makes a mistake, you don't have to start over from scratch. Plus, your child will see how helpful it is to have everything lined up and organized when you're ready to start cooking.Give your child the fun tasks. Let your child squeeze lemons, sprinkle in cheese or spices, spread icing, crack eggs (be sure to wash hands afterward), or mash potatoes.Involve your child in planning meals. Having your child help plan a meal is a good way to teach him about what goes into a healthy, balanced diet. Tasks kids can do: read recipes, plan menus, help shop, and set the table.Have your child help with the cleanup. Cleaning up is part of the cooking process. Your child can help wash or rinse plastic or unbreakable dishes, dry pots with a towel, load the dishwasher, or sponge down a counter. Let her sweep up with a short-handled broom and dustpan.Check out some simple cookbooks written especially for kids. Try no-cook recipes to start, such as dips, smoothies, and salads.

Five ways to get your kids active,https://www.babycenter.com/0_five-ways-to-get-your-kids-active_67783.bc,"Get going in the great outdoorsWhen your child hits grade school, you're left with a narrow window of time in late afternoon when you or her after-school child care provider can encourage your child to exercise. And at this age TV, videos, and computer games can compete for her attention.Experts say, though, that grade-schoolers need at least 60 minutes of physical activity every day.One of the best ways to make sure that your child gets all the exercise she needs is to head outside, says David Bernhardt, a sports medicine pediatrician at the University of Wisconsin in Madison.Kids tend to run, climb, hop, skip, and jump much more in the great outdoors than they do when stuck inside. And kids this age are even more likely to do those things if they have a friend along, since doing activities with peers is all-important now.So scout out some safe outdoor play places for your child, and bring along a buddy or two plus bats, balls, and bikes (don't forget the helmets), jump ropes, scooters, and skateboards. And keep an eye on them as they race around together. If your child is in an after-school child care program, make sure exercise is a regular part of the schedule.Set a good exampleYou probably already know that what you say has an impact on how your grade-schooler talks, and that what you eat affects her diet. The same goes for exercise: Your child's future fitness and activity level are influenced by how you spend your spare time, says Bernhardt.So when you can, walk to school, the shops, the library, or a friend's house rather than piling into the car.At home, take the time to do yoga stretches or a dance workout  and encourage her to join in. If she sees you keeping fit, she's more likely to develop this healthy habit too.Exercise togetherBuild in some time each day to exercise together  just as you try to have a family meal and keep a bedtime routine. Even venturing out after dinner for a walk to search for stars or chase fireflies counts. What's most important is that you come up with a game plan that works for your family.On the weekends, make sure some family outings are active ones (for instance, swimming at the town pool, sledding in the park, or riding on a bike trail) instead of sedentary ones, such as taking a drive. Head to the beach to comb for hidden treasures, or hike a nearby nature trail and keep an eye out for curious creatures.Any activities that also promote free play  such as tag, kick ball, or Marco Polo at the pool  are excellent ways to weave exercise in. Support your child's favorite sportResearchers have found that children whose parents actively encourage their physical pursuits  by driving them to soccer practice, say, and cheering them on  are much more likely to stick with these activities than kids whose parents show little enthusiasm. It doesn't matter whether the activity is swimming, ice-skating, or shooting hoops: The important part is that you encourage the exercise.The focus at this age, though, should be making fitness fun and developing skills  not producing future Olympians or beating the other team. You don't want to pressure your child to perform or force her to do a sport she doesn't like. Both strategies almost always backfire, and you risk turning her away from physical activity altogether.Whether your child chooses an organized sport, which can teach leadership and teamwork skills along with improving overall fitness and motor skills, or a solo pursuit, which can also foster self-sufficiency, the goal should be helping your child find an exercise routine she'll enjoy.""Competition should be discouraged at this age,"" says Bernhardt. ""If your youngster enjoys the peer relationships and social aspects of team sports, though, take advantage of this as a way to promote fitness and exercise.""Family fitness vacationsMake your travel plans with physical activity in mind. Look for family-friendly vacation spots that make exercise easy.Find a cabin by a lake, for instance, that includes a canoe to paddle in, a rope to swing from, and some biking trails to explore. Plan a summer beach getaway to the shore so you can swim, sail, or boogie board together. Or take a winter break in the snow and go sledding, snow boarding, or cross-country skiing.Holiday camps that teach new skills  such as horseback riding, cross-country skiing, or roller blading  are also a fun way to get your grade-schooler going.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012a.

8 things nutritionists wish you'd do during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-food-diary,"Between exhaustion, ""morning"" sickness, and ravenous hunger, pregnancy can make it a challenge to eat right. But growing babies rely on their mom for sustenance, so you'll want to make good choices about what goes into your mouth  and into your womb. Read on to discover the eight most important things nutritionists recommend for healthy eating and weight gain during pregnancy.1. Find out how much you should gain""Know your numbers,"" says Jessica Corwin, a registered dietitian and community nutrition educator for Spectrum Health in Michigan. ""We should gain different amounts of weight based on our individual BMI. It's helpful to ask your doctor how much you should be gaining.""Guidelines call for women who begin pregnancy at a healthy weight to put on between 25 to 35 pounds. Women who are underweight or having twins or multiples are advised to gain more, while women who are overweight or obese should gain less. Get the details on how much weight you should gain during pregnancy and why.Those extra pounds are critical for your baby's growth and development. But with a typical baby weighing 7.5 pounds, what's all the rest of the weight for?Here's a breakdown: An expectant mom's breasts add up to 2 additional pounds as they swell in preparation to feed the baby. The placenta and growing uterus add another 4 pounds. Factor in the extra blood flowing through your body  up to 3.5 pounds, which explains why a pregnant woman's iron needs are so high  and 6 to 8 pounds of amniotic fluid and other fluids, and you're starting to feel heavy. Plus, your body will need up to 9 more pounds of fat to use as energy reserves during pregnancy and lactation.2. Exercise regularlyDon't assume that pregnancy is a good time to suspend your gym membership. It's important to remain physically active for your own health and that of your baby. Hitting the treadmill or attending pregnancy yoga keeps your body strong, can help prevent gestational diabetes, and can help you avoid gaining too much weight, which can lead to a too-big baby. Regular exercise also prepares you for the ultimate workout: labor and delivery.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women (who have received their provider's approval to work out) exercise moderately for at least 20 to 30 minutes on most, if not all, days of the week. Unfortunately, many moms-to-be aren't exercising this much.""A lot of my patients tell me they're not active at all,"" says Eleana Kaidanian, a New York registered dietitian who counsels pregnant women.Kaidanian recommends fitting in exercise whenever and however you can. ""Even if it's just 10 minutes of walking around your apartment after each meal, that's 30 minutes you weren't doing before.""3. Drink waterThe Institute of Medicine recommends that pregnant women drink 10 8-ounce glasses of water or other beverages each day. (If it's warm out or you're exercising, drink even more.)When Kaidanian asks her pregnant patients what they drink when they're thirsty, more often than not, they list soda, juice, or coffee. However, it's best to keep caffeine and sugar to a minimum during your pregnancy. (Even 100 percent fruit juice contains a lot of natural sugars.)""Water is the best source of hydration,"" says Kaidanian. If you're not tracking your fluid ounces, just tote a water bottle with you wherever you go and sip throughout the day until your urine is clear or pale yellow in color  a sign of proper hydration.If plain water isn't appealing  or is even nauseating  try sparkling water with various flavors (like lemon, orange, and berry) or water with a squeeze of lemon. Or make spa water: Keep a pitcher of tap water in the fridge and add cut oranges, apples, or other fruit to infuse it with subtle flavor.4. Be diligent about prenatal vitaminsI forgot. It's too big. I don't like it.Kaidanian hears a lot of reasons for skipping a daily prenatal vitamin and accepts none of them. Just take yours, she says, because prenatal vitamins are a nearly effortless way to ensure you and your baby are getting the nutrients you need. Many women's diets are deficient in vitamin D and iron as well as folic acid, which is critical in the prevention of neural tube defects such as spina bifida.""It's hard to meet your nutrient intake every day for every single nutrient unless you're planning out specifically what you need for your body, and most people are not doing that,"" says Kaidanian. ""They make so many kinds of prenatal vitamins now  chewables, gummies, and even mini vitamins for those who find them hard to swallow  there's really no excuse.""5. Avoid gaining too muchGaining too much weight during pregnancy increases your risk for gestational diabetes and birth complications such as c-section delivery and tearing.Excess weight gain can lead to a larger baby, which can make for a harder delivery, says Daniel Roshan, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in New York City and an assistant professor at New York University.""We try to keep our c-section rate down, so we really emphasize diet,"" says Roshan. If an expecting mom is eating unhealthily, he says, ""it's like the baby is sitting around having chocolate all day. He gets chubby. When it comes time for delivery, it's harder for him to come out, so there's a bigger chance of complications.""6. Eat small mealsWhen you're nauseated, the thought of a large meal can really turn your stomach. And later in pregnancy, as your baby crowds your stomach and other digestive organs, eating even a fairly modest amount of food at one time can be uncomfortable.Feel free to focus on eating frequent mini-meals. ""Eating small meals often helps because it constantly keeps a little bit of something in your stomach and keeps your blood sugar even,"" says Ashley Roman, director of the New York University Maternal Fetal Care Center.7. Snack smartStock your kitchen with healthy staples so you can easily grab good-for-you snacks. Wash fresh fruit ahead of time and keep portioned bags of trail mix in your desk at work. String cheese and whole grain crackers are satisfying too. Try whipping up a batch of smoothie over the weekend, then freezing it in individual jars.At night, stick a jar in the fridge to defrost. Come morning, add some wheat germ or flax seed and call it breakfast.""Every bite when you're pregnant is impacting your baby, so if you can include nutrition, you'll feel better about snacking,"" says dietitian Jessica Corwin.8. Learn to substituteIt's fine to give into your food cravings in moderation, but it's smart to give them healthier tweaks  especially if they're becoming frequent items on your menu.For example, if you regularly yearn for pizza, follow Ellie Krieger's lead and make pizza on a whole-grain English muffin with part-skim cheese, tomato sauce, and spinach. ""I craved pizza constantly,"" says Krieger, who hosted Food Network's Healthy Appetite and is the author of Weeknight Wonders. ""That hit the spot without going all out and having a big, greasy slice each day.""Craving chocolate? Krieger suggests stirring a tablespoon of cocoa powder and a bit of sugar into a glass of warm, low-fat milk. ""You get the antioxidant bonus from the cocoa and calcium from the milk, it's the perfect snack size  about 200 calories, and it's filling.""Bonnie Rochman is a health writer who is at work on a book about how genetics is reshaping childhood.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015a.

Disney travel mistakes every parent should know about,https://www.babycenter.com/0_disney-travel-mistakes-every-parent-should-know-about_10410529.bc,"Taking your little ones to Disneyland, Disney California Adventure, or Walt Disney World can be a dream come true. It can also be overwhelming and exhausting  especially if you make some classic mistakes.To make the most of your family's trip, take note of these warnings from parents in the BabyCenter Community's Disney travel group.Plan, plan, planNot planning well was the most common pitfall parents mentioned.Before you get to the park, check Disney maps and schedules online and plan your day(s), at least roughly. Decide which areas you'll head for and in what order, your must-see attractions, where you'll eat, and any shows you want to catch. If you have a baby or toddler, note the locations of bathrooms and Baby Care Centers.If you're counting on enjoying certain attractions, check the Disney site to make sure they'll be up and running on your dates. (Rides at all the Disney parks are closed for maintenance and ""refurbishment' at regular intervals.) Even if you can't avoid going when a favorite ride will be offline, knowing ahead of time lets you manage your (and your children's!) expectations.It's a good idea to download one of the Disney apps to your phone, too. These show you maps, schedules, and wait times for various rides.""Our first mistake was walking into the parks blind. We didn't research anything and missed so much. We missed everything at Epcot because we didn't know there was anything in World Showcase."" KasiaN""We spent the first three to four days crossing the parks like crazy. I felt like we walked 10 miles each day. We needed a better plan of attack."" PinkEllie""Pick up a Times Guide right when you get into the parks. We plan our day around shows, parades, and fireworks."" wigglyboy""If you go to Walt Disney World pregnant, know where the bathrooms are. I swear I visited all of them!"" Twimmie_Too""On our first trip to Disneyland and California Adventure I didn't write our schedule down, and with pregnancy brain I led us to the wrong places at the wrong times. We completely missed the musical show on two different days. If you plan, write it down or keep track of it all in some way."" Mandyg923""I was shocked by how huge Disney World is! The place is insanely large if you're used to Disneyland. I didn't realize how far apart the parks and hotels were  it's a long walk to get from one place to the other. Disney World and Disneyland are like half-sisters raised by different moms. Even though they have the same dad, they grew up very differently."" The Random MomUse the Disney ""fastpass"" systemsBoth Disney World and the Disneyland Resort (Disneyland + California Advernture Park) offer a free ""fastpass"" service that helps you skip the super-long lines at certain very popular rides by giving you tickets for a particular time of day. Fastpass works differently and has a slightly different name, however, in each place.Walt Disney World: The service here is called FastPass+. It gives you priority boarding in a one-hour window at many popular rides if you sign up online, in advance.To sign up, you need a ticket, an annual pass, or a Disney World Resort room-and-ticket package.Do it as early as possible because FastPass+ spots, while free, are limited. You can sign up 30 to 60 days before you go.You can reserve up to three rides for a single theme park per day of your ticket  and add more during your visit, space permitting.The Disney World sitehas more details.Disneyland and California Adventure Park: The West coast service is called simply Fastpass, and you don't need to sign up ahead of time. It applies to the most popular attractions at the two California parks, allowing you to pick up tickets at those rides for a time slot later that day, when you can return and get priority boarding. Two things to remember:Fastpass tickets can save you a lot of time waiting, but to use them you'll need to build some flexibility into your schedule.The tickets are free but limited, so get them for your favorite rides as early in the day as possible.The Disneyland Resort site has more details.""The first two times my husband and I went to Disneyland, we thought you had to pay for Fastpasses, so we didn't even bother at the machines. Ay yai yai."" MizzFran17Make reservationsMost things at Disney don't require  or take  reservations, but there are exceptions.For example, if you want to treat your kids to a character dining experience or a makeover at the Bibbidi Bobbidi Boutique, book as far in advance as possible. (You can make reservations online up to 180 days before your visit.)The same goes for all full-service sit-down restaurants at Disney World don't expect to be able to reserve after you arrive. Disneyland restaurants, on the other hand, are not nearly as booked up, other than at a few popular spots such as Blue Bayou, where you can reserve up to 60 days ahead. You can even walk in at many places if you're willing to wait.""We didn't make reservations for our character dining. I thought we could have a princess meal without a reservation. Nope."" ErikaUnderstand your dining planSome vacation packages at Walt Disney World offer the Disney Dining Plans, which win points for convenience but can lead to confusion.""Sit down and figure out which meals and snack credits you're going to use when, especially if your flight gets in late afternoon or early evening and leaves before breakfast time."" sweetpeama""Double check before you order what counts toward a snack credit. I can't tell you how many times I missed out on using a snack credit because I didn't pay attention!"" hizdanzer""Next time I'll use our snack credits more efficiently instead of spending 11 at Goofy's on the last day  though I really enjoyed all my treats!"" PimamaDon't overpack""For our first trip, I had Emi in the carrier, the stroller, and a giant diaper bag with 15 diapers, a full box of wipes, five burp cloths, three outfits, five bottles, a full can of formula, two water bottles, and lunch for me. The next time I took her in the front carrier and carried a backpack with five diapers, 10 wipes, a plastic bag, two bottles, and a small container of formula. I carried a water bottle on my hip and refilled it with water from the fountains for both of us."" mama2emi""When we got home I realized that our huge checked bag was full of clean clothes!"" PinkEllieSchedule tons of down timeThe Disney experience can be overwhelming. If you're staying at a Disney resort, take advantage of the amenities and give everyone a break from the crowds, lines, and sensory overload. Consider taking a whole day to relax there  you'll be glad you did.Some resorts have beautiful pools with slides and various activities scheduled every day. At Disney World, you can ride the boats and monorail if you are staying at one of the resorts. Moms tells us, for example, that Fort Wilderness Lodge is wonderful, because you can walk or ride bikes on trails, rent little boats, and so on.""I wish we had planned a resort day in the middle of our trip to let the little ones catch up on sleep and to enjoy the resort. We didn't even see it during daylight hours until our departure day!"" Pimama""We never really enjoyed our resort. We would wake up, get ready, and go. By the time we got back it was bedtime. Next time I'm going to plan a rest day to swim and explore."" Bossart7203""On our first trip my husband was so eager for me to love Walt Disney World that he crammed every experience and restaurant into one week. I was exhausted, sick from eating too much, and overwhelmed."" LB002""Before you go, you must accept one fact: You cannot do everything. Not leaving time to relax and rest is a huge mistake."" LeslieAdamBabyKnow your child's limits""I knew this was a mistake but my husband insisted that our first ride with our 19-month-old be Pirates of the Caribbean, since she loves pirates. She was terrified of any indoor ride for the rest of the trip."" SweetPeaBabyLove""Before we had our daughter, my husband and I would stop in for one day on the way to the beach and hit the main rides in all four parks in one day. With small children, that's obviously a bad idea. There are many things we've never seen or done with our child, even though I consider myself somewhat of a veteran."" RebeccaCrokeWear comfy shoes""Make sure all footwear fits before you leave. My 11-year-old magically outgrew his sandals between August and September, but we didn't know that until we got to Disney!"" Ohiocouponmom""Do not wear new shoes, even if they're exactly like your old pair.You want nice, broken-in shoes."" The Random MomDon't miss out on keepsakes""If you see something in a shop that you like, buy it. You won't find a better price somewhere else."" Benoit83""Get a couple of family pictures with everyone together. Every picture we have is either of my husband and our little one or me and our little one."" Benoit83Prepare for weather and accidents""My big mistake was not taking extra clothes for my 3-year-old. Even though she had been potty trained for more than a year, she had an accident when we were in line. I had to buy a pack of underwear and shorts. They were not cheap!"" Christophersmommy""Bring ponchos into Walt Disney World when thunderstorms are expected. I can't tell you how many times I've forgotten ours in the car and we end up buying more ponchos inside!"" wigglyboy"
Seven secrets to successful travel with a toddler,https://www.babycenter.com/0_seven-secrets-to-successful-travel-with-a-toddler_1463414.bc,"As you gear up for a trip with your toddler, we suggest you think of your young traveling companion as someone who'll add a whole new dimension to your travel experiences. Be sure you dial down your expectations, set realistic goals, and take it nice 'n' easy.Here are some parent-tested suggestions for traveling with a young child:Be flexibleTraveling with children can be a wonderful experience  if you go with the flow. Your toddler might get bored having to sit still or sightsee for long periods of time instead of being able to run around and explore at her own energetic pace, so keep your itinerary simple. Limit it to one activity a day and you'll find it much easier to make last-minute adjustments if your child gets tired or just wants to spend time splashing in the hotel's wading pool.Pick a family-friendly destinationChoose a relaxing destination that's used to young visitors, so you don't have to sweat the details. We recommend a lazy beach retreat, family camp, nature resort, or similar kid-friendly place. Skip the crowded, over-stimulating tourist destinations, places without shade, and other spots that will pose an added challenge when you have a young one in tow.Look for family-friendly hotels and resorts that let kids stay for free in their parents' rooms and provide free meals to children or buffet-style breakfasts included in the price of the room.Bring drinks and snacksMake sure to tote along plenty to drink and a bag of snacks on any trip. Children can get dehydrated during a flight, and toddlers can't always wait for food service (or they refuse the airline meal when it arrives). You might be able to pre-order a children's meal  check with your airline to find out.Whether you're in the air or on the road, best bets for toddlers include easy-to-pack snacks like baggies of whole grain cereal, precut fruits and vegetables, small cartons of fruit juice, animal crackers, and other age-appropriate nibbles.Dispensing snacks at pre-announced intervals will give your toddler something to look forward to. Consider bringing along moist towelettes for easy cleanup.Plan frequent rest stopsIf you're driving, break up your trip so your toddler can stretch her limbs and move around to blow off some pent-up energy. Pack a rubber or foam ball for rolling or kicking around and some simple board books for quiet time. Pick out parks and picnic areas on your route by using the mapping app, Oh, Ranger! Parkfinder and find the nearest public restroom with SitOrSquat.End your driving day early so all of you have time to unwind after a long day on the road.Think safetyWhen you pack for your toddler, be sure to include a basic childproofing kit to use at your destination. If you're taking a road trip, make sure your child's car seat is properly secured. According to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration and the SeatCheck campaign, 7 out of 10 of car seats aren't installed correctly. Use removable window shades to keep the sun off your child.How to install a convertible car seat: Forward-facing Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 3:18Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -3:18Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosYou may want to dress your toddler in a brightly colored outfit so she's easy to spot in a crowd. Put a small card with identification information on it in one of her pockets in case you get separated, and snap a picture of her with your cell phone in case you need help finding her.Pack a goody bagA good way to keep kids content on a trip is to take along a goody bag filled with more toys and doodads than you think you'll need. Your toddler might like an array of puzzles, dolls, action figures, puppets, brightly colored paper, nontoxic crayons, books, and favorite toys.Wrap some of them before you leave and present your child with a surprise every once in a while. Start building your toy cache a few weeks before the trip.Take practice tripsTo get a feel for what works and what doesn't when you're on the road and away from home, you might try leading up to a big trip with some short day trips or weekend getaways. The trial runs could provide key insights  about things like what supplies you should pack, how long your child can last in a car seat, and which toys keep your toddler happy (or drive you nuts).Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

How to host a super sleepover,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-host-a-super-sleepover_66963.bc,"Planning the sleepoverKeep the guest list short. If it's your child's first time hosting a sleepover, keep the group to two or three so it doesn't become overwhelming. If it's a birthday party and your child is a veteran of sleepovers, she might want to invite more guests. Four or five is plenty for a big group at this age, especially at bedtime when they tend to get each other over-excited.Pick a convenient drop-off time. Make the drop-off time later in the day. At this age, if kids spend too much time together, they can get on each other's nerves before the night is through. But since kids consider sharing meals a special treat, have guests arrive in time for dinner.Send invitations? For a birthday sleepover, send invitations to create a buzz and to receive timely RSVPs that will help you plan. For an ordinary sleepover, however, inviting by telephone is quick and easy.Plan a few specific activities. While kids will manage to find their own entertainment, having several games and activities at the ready (with a couple of backup ideas in case Plan A doesn't last as long as expected) will help harness nervous energy and keep the kids from becoming mischievous and rowdy. Be sure to get your child's input, and include both indoor and outdoor activities in your arsenal in case outdoor plans must be shelved due to bad weather. Some fun indoor crafts include painting hats or gloves (or baseball caps in the summer) with bright neon fabric paint; and making picture frames out of Popsicle sticks, gluing on shiny jewels and stones, and inserting a Polaroid snapshot of each child inside. And any craft project that's made doubles as a take-home favor and souvenir.When planning games, don't forget the classics: Musical Chairs, Pin-the-Tail-on-the-Donkey, Hide-and-Go-Seek, and Twister are as popular today as ever. A word to the wise: If you award prizes, be sure to give similar ones to the winners and losers alike. School-age kids may seem mature enough to handle losing, but many are not, and you don't want to end up with pouting party guests.Joan Wenters, Ph.D., a clinical and developmental psychologist at Children's Hospital in Oakland, California, suggests planning one major activity outside the home  going to the movies, the bowling alley, an ice skating or roller skating rink, or a swimming pool. Not only is it a great way to create excitement, but it tires out the troops for a (hopefully) earlier bedtime.Think ""theme""A theme sleepover is fun, especially if it's a birthday party, and it helps give a framework for the activities, food, and favors. Lisa Church, author of Everyday Creative Play: Simple Fun Things You Can Do to Help Your Young Child Learn, offers these suggestions:A 70s dance party. Kids can dress in hippie garb, make tie-dyed T-shirts, dance to funky tunes to the light of a disco ball, and decorate cupcakes with peace signs.A sports-themed party. For a baseball party, for example, guests can play baseball in the backyard, play paper-and-pencil games (like Hangman, using baseball terms), and engage in a round of Hot Potato with a baseball.A tea party. Guests can dress up in their Sunday best and serve apple juice.A pirate party: Decorate pirate hats (gluing on feathers and glitter), draw a map to some hidden trinkets, and have them go on a treasure hunt.You can get as extravagant as you want with a theme party, but you don't have to break the bank. If you start planning early enough, you'll have time to shop around for bargains at thrift shops and garage sales. And don't feel like you have to buy everything; if your sister has a lava lamp from her hippie days, borrow it for your party  or ask guests to supply a few of their own props.No-fuss foodHave kids for dinner. Pizza is still king of sleepover fare, and for good reason  it's easy for you, and most kids like it. Luckily, kids at this age love to help out in the kitchen, so you can turn dinner preparation into a bona fide activity. The easiest way to go about this is to let the kids make their own English muffin pizzas  all you have to do is supply the toppings and pop them into the oven. (They can also make their own cupcakes or sundaes for dessert.)Have munchies on hand. Sweet and salty treats are par for the course, but you should also offer healthy snacks like veggies and dip. To make the vegetables more appealing (next to the packaged goods, they're bound to suffer), consider setting out a smorgasbord of colorful dips.Make happy-face pancakes for breakfast.Use blueberries for the eyes and banana slices for the mouth. (You can also substitute chocolate chips and whipped cream.) If your group is large, however, you might want to simply offer individual boxes of cereal and bananas or other fruit.Bedtime basicsAnticipate special needs. It's possible that your sleepover may be a child's first experience spending the night away from home without her parents. It's a good idea to talk to each guest's parents to see if their child will be able to make it through the night. Arrange a way to reach them if their child should want to go home. Wenters recommends that, if a parent is on the fence about this, you suggest the child be picked up at bedtime and then returned in the morning for breakfast. Regardless, ask all children to bring a stuffed animal or blanket for comfort.Arrange sleeping bags in a democratic manner. To avoid hurt feelings from getting stuck on the edge, suggest that the kids arrange their bags in a starburst pattern  in a circle with heads toward the center. This way, everyone's in the huddle.Set a specific bedtime.Some kids think sleepovers mean that they get to stay up all night, so it's a good idea to give them a time for ""lights out."" But expect that they'll talk and giggle for a while after  that's the fun part! At this age, 10 p.m. is a reasonable bedtime.Introduce a wind-down activity and stay involved. You might want to have kids watch a movie in their pajamas or read them a peaceful story to bring the level of activity down a notch, suggests Wenters. Being a part of the wind-down will help speed things along, too, she says; if left to their own devices, they won't hit the sack until well past their bedtime. Some kids like scary stories, but it's probably best to avoid them at this age. A child might be too embarrassed to admit she is afraid, but then won't be able to sleep. Once lights are ""out,"" leave a night-light on and tell all the kids they can knock on your door if they need anything.Your child's role as hostOf course, you are the chief host of this sleepover. But it's nice if visiting kids could look to your child as a co-host, as well. A sleepover is also a great opportunity to begin to teach your youngster the basics of gracious hospitality. Performing simple deeds, like taking guests' coats when they arrive or passing out slices of birthday cake, are wonderful training in good manners. Being kind by comforting a homesick child, for example, is the kind of action that will put her guests at ease and give your child a feeling of pride in herself as the anchor of the group.Great good-byesArrange a specific pick-up time. All good things must come to an end, of course, and short and sweet is the best way to curtail the fun. If you don't mark an end, people will come at all hours, and a succession of unpredictable doorbell rings and good-byes can be chaotic for you and the kids. About a half hour before pick-up time, tell the kids to pack up their sleeping bags and other belongings.Have a ""special"" guest stay a little longer. If one of the visiting kids includes your child's closest friend, you might want to ask that guest to stay a little while longer than the rest so your child has some one-on-one time with her best buddy and doesn't feel abandoned when everyone leaves. (Just keep this arrangement between you and the other child's parents so the other kids don't feel left out.)"
Managing depression during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_managing-depression-during-pregnancy_10415698.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineDepression during pregnancy can feel very isolating, but you're far from alone: About 1 in 10 women have depression during and after pregnancy. And the actual number could be even higher because many women with depression are reluctant to ask for help.Although you may worry now that you're expecting, depression during pregnancy is very treatable. Taking action to get help may be difficult, but it's the first step to recovery. Here's what you need to know.How do I get help for depression during pregnancy?If you're not yet being treated for depression, talk to your healthcare provider. She can screen you for depression and anxiety then refer you to a maternal-fetal medicine or another specialist if necessary. A range of mental health professionals can help you, including:PsychiatristsPsychologistsSocial workersPsychiatric nursesCounselorsWhich type of professional you see depends on your needs and preferences as well as the cost. Check your health plan to find out what's covered.If you're already being treated for depression but still feel low, your provider may need to adjust your medication or change your treatment plan. Having a relapse during pregnancy is common, especially if you've stopped taking your medication. You might even notice the first signs of postpartum depression during pregnancy.Whatever your treatment, healthcare professionals will work with you to ensure you and your baby get the best care possible.What's the treatment for depression during pregnancy?Your options depend on how severe your depression is. Your treatment may include talk therapy, medication, or both.Talk therapy is usually tried before starting medication, but your insurance may not cover it. Check your plan to find out.Talk therapyTalk therapy is regular appointments to discuss your thoughts, feelings, or behavior with a mental health professional. It's likely you'll meet once a week for 12 to 16 sessions. You may talk with a therapist individually or participate in a group with other people going through a similar experience. Common types of talk therapy include:Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT). CBT alters patterns of negative thinking or behavior to change the way you feel. CBT teaches you to identify distorted thinking, recognize inaccurate beliefs, and help you see yourself and relate to others more positively. Some therapists use relaxation techniques, like mindful meditation, as part of the process.Couples, family, or interpersonal therapy (IPT). These types of therapies are similar and help when relationships suffer because of depression, or if problems in relationships contribute to the condition. A therapist helps a partner or relatives understand depression and how to help a loved one with the condition. Couples and family members come up with ways to support each other, and patients learn to help a partner cope better with the illness. Improving these relationships makes it easier to get support.CBT and IPT are often effective for treating mild to moderate depression, but if talk therapy alone doesn't work, your provider may recommend medication as well.Antidepressant medicationThere are a lot of medications available to treat depression, and many are considered safe to take during pregnancy. It takes between three to four weeks for antidepressants to take effect, though some people start to feel better after just a week or two.Your provider may recommend antidepressant medication if depression stops you from functioning in your daily life and you're struggling to cope. Antidepressants might also be a good option if:You tried talk therapy and it didn't work.You tried stopping or lowering your dose of antidepressants and your symptoms returned.You have another mental health condition in addition to depression, such as bipolar disorder or panic disorder.In extreme cases, if your depression is making you suicidal or psychotic (including delusions and hallucinations), you'll be referred to a psychiatrist for emergency medication.The first time you take an antidepressant you may experience side effects, such as an upset stomach, nausea, or trouble sleeping, but these usually go away after a few weeks. To monitor your progress, your provider should check in with you often, either in person or by phone.Deciding whether to take antidepressants during pregnancy can be difficult. Taking antidepressants during pregnancy isn't entirely risk-free, but the risk is fairly low. These drugs can cross the placenta and problems are possible, though rare. They may increase the likelihood that a baby will have problems such as being born early. But not treating your depression effectively can be harmful too. Your depression could get worse and make it hard for you to care for yourself, which would also affect your baby.Ask your provider to explain the pros and cons of your treatment options and answer any questions you have. Knowing more about the safety of taking antidepressants during pregnancy may help you decide what to do.Electroconvulsive TherapyElectroconvulsive therapy (ECT) involves having an electric current passed through the brain to induce a controlled seizure. ECT is considered safe and effective for chronic depression, but isn't usually recommended during pregnancy unless a woman has a very severe case of depression or depression-related psychosis. There's limited research on the effects of ECT during pregnancy, so it's used only when other treatments don't work.Do alternative therapies help depression?It's hard to know. Most providers will tell you that there's not enough evidence to show that alternative therapies are effective for treating depression during pregnancy. Sometimes this just means that not enough research has been done to draw any definite conclusions about a particular therapy.Safety is an issue, depending on the alternative therapy. This can be a real concern, especially if the therapy involves ingesting a substance that could be harmful to you and your baby. And some alternative therapies are expensive, so it may be good advice not to waste your money.Still, some women swear that alternative therapies are helpful for managing depression during pregnancy, and some options are less risky than others. If you're interested in learning more about certain alternative therapies before trying one, you may want to talk to your provider about:Acupuncture. In this therapy, an acupuncturist gently places needles into your skin at specific points on your body that correspond to specific organs. Some studies suggest that acupuncture may be beneficial for treating depression, and acupuncture with a qualified therapist is safe during pregnancy.Light therapy. This involves sitting in front of a bright white light for a period of time each day. It's typically used to treat seasonal affective disorder, a type of depression that tends to occur in the fall and winter months when the days are shorter and there's less daylight.Massage. If you've ever had a massage, you know that it can help you feel relaxed. It's possible that getting a massage regularly, either from your partner or a massage therapist, could also help relieve depression. Meditation. Research suggests that mindfulness meditation can help you regulate your emotions, increase self-awareness, and reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression. Mindfulness meditation involves being present in the moment by focusing attention on your breath and your thoughts.Yoga. Yoga combines stretching poses, breathing, and meditation, and, like any type of exercise, can relieve stress and make you feel better. Learn how to do yoga safely during pregnancy.What else can help me cope with depression?In addition to following your treatment plan, taking care of yourself physically and emotionally is the best thing you can do. You may find it hard, but figuring out what makes you feel even a little bit better will ease your symptoms and help you cope. Here are some things to try:Get support. Sharing your feelings with your partner, friends, and family can help you feel better. They may be able to offer some perspective or practical help, and you may also find that simply talking about your emotions makes them seem more manageable. Ask your provider about local support groups.Take time to relax. Stress is a common trigger for depression, so try to take a break when you can. Having lunch with your partner, listening to music, or taking a calming bath can lift your mood. It can sometimes be difficult to find time to relax, especially if you already have children or work outside the home. So accept any help that allows you to take a little time to yourself.Protect your sleep. Pregnancy and depression can both disrupt your sleep. Give yourself the best odds of getting a good night's rest by cutting back on caffeine (especially in the afternoon and evening), being active during the day, and not eating a heavy meal just before bed.Eat healthy and stay hydrated. Eat regular meals with healthy snacks in between to boost your energy and give your baby the nutrition he needs to grow. Drink plenty of water or noncaffeinated drinks to stay hydrated.Exercise. Exercise can alleviate depression because the brain releases feel-good chemicals that boost your mood. Go for a leisurely stroll, take a swim, or try some pregnancy yoga. Talk to your provider first before starting any exercise regimen.When should I call my healthcare provider?If you feel like you can't cope, or if your symptoms are getting worse, call your provider.

Picky eaters: 6 chefs share personal stories,https://www.babycenter.com/0_picky-eaters-6-chefs-share-personal-stories_1745728.bc,"Meet the expert teamOur experts from Picky Eaters: Strategies and recipes to win them over share their professional experiences  and personal memories  about the tricky task of feeding kids.The Sneaky ChefMissy Chase Lapine,mother of two, is the author of The Sneaky Chef: Simple Strategies for Hiding Healthy Foods in Kids' Favorite Meals Chase Lapine's oldest daughter chowed down on seaweed salad, caviar, and other exotica from toddlerhood. Chase Lapine thought her child's adventurous palate was the result of good parenting. Then her second daughter entered the picture and the term picky eater entered her vocabulary.Childhood food memory: ""I spent many a night in front of a cold bowl of spinach. That scarred me for life. To this day, I despise spinach. I can only eat it if it's hidden in something else.""Food lessons: The challenges of feeding her own picky eater, youngest daughter Samantha, prompted Chase Lapine to develop the recipes for her best-selling book, which sings the praises of concealing nutrition-packed, so-called superfoods like spinach, sweet potatoes, and blueberries  in foods lots of kids love, like brownies, French toast, and spaghetti sauce. ""I started sneaking as a last resort,"" admits Chase Lapine, former publisher of Eating Well magazine. ""But it gives me peace of mind.""Visit Missy's website: thesneakychef.comThe Renegade Lunch LadyAnn Cooper doesn't have kids of her own, but she feeds thousands of school-age children every day as the Director of Food Services for the Boulder Valley School District in Colorado. She is coauthor of Lunch Lessons: Changing the Way We Feed Our Children.""One of the most important things parents can do is set a good example,"" says Cooper. ""If you turn your nose up at certain foods, like broccoli, you can't expect your child to try it either.""Childhood food memory: ""In the summer, I used to go with my grandfather to catch flounder and lobster  I grew up on the East Coast  and then we'd pick his home-grown tomatoes. It wasn't high cuisine, but we ate local, fresh, healthy real food.""Food lessons: Cooper hasn't always served school food  she's also cooked for the likes of Hillary Clinton and the Grateful Dead. Cooper firmly believes that processed, trans-fat and sugar-filled foods have no place on a school lunch menu. So when she took over the Berkeley public school cafeterias three years ago, she nixed junky chicken nuggets, burgers, and fries. Instead, she serves meals made from scratch, brimming with seasonal, local, and organic fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Perhaps her biggest hit? The self-serve salad bar. Given half a chance, it turns out, kids really do like to eat their greens.Visit Ann's website: lunchlessons.orgThe Lovingly Deceptive MomJessica Seinfeld, mother of three, is the author of Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food. Before she began secretly adding wholesome, pureed foods to her children's favorite dishes, Seinfeld dreaded family dinners and the endless effort to get her kids to eat their veggies.Childhood food memory: ""I grew up with a single mom who shopped at a natural food co-op then went home and cooked for three kids after a very long work day. If she could do it, then I can do it. She made delicious, healthy versions of traditional favorites like spaghetti and meatballs  that would be my last meal.""Food lessons: ""Sascha is my toughest taster,"" says Seinfeld, who is indeed the wife of that funny guy with the same last name. ""She's apprehensive about food and rarely will try anything new. The baby eats anything. And Julian is a good eater  if his sister isn't around to influence him."" Encouraged by her success on the home front with hidden nutrition  butternut squash disguised in mac and cheese, for starters  Seinfled decided to write a book about camouflage cooking to help other flummoxed parents. Mealtimes at the Seinfelds are pure pleasure, she says, since she started practicing ""loving deception.""Visit Jessica's website: doitdelicious.comThe Healthy-Living ChefJennifer Iserloh isa private chef and consultant on Seinfeld's Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food as well author of her own books on healthy eating, including Secrets of a Skinny Chef.Like all proponents of so-called hidden nutrition, Iserloh says it's no substitute for also offering the unadorned foods in their recognizable form. ""You don't want to send the signal that vegetables aren't a good thing,"" she says.Childhood food memory: ""My mother died when I was three, and I was raised by my granny. I've eaten a lot of great food cooked by four-star chefs, and let me tell you, my granny has got the goods. I cooked with her from a young age. She had a garden, too: She grew eggplants, Swiss chard, rhubarb  even asparagus. There's nothing like eating freshly picked vegetables.""Food lessons: A private chef who has worked with several families, Iserloh has no qualms about secretly adding healthy ingredients to classic dishes, as she does in Seinfeld's cookbook. Recently she filmed a pilot for a TV show that's focused on helping overweight families make better food choices. She brings personal experience to the table: Most of her immediate family is morbidly obese, says Jennifer, who won her own battle with the bulge through healthier eating and exercise.Visit Jennifer's website: skinnychef.com The Commonsense CookVicki Lansky ismother of two, grandma of three, and author of more than 30 books, including Feed Me I'm Yours and Taming of the C.A.N.D.Y. Monster. Her message for moms and dads dealing with challenges on the food front is one she knows may be hard to hear: Relax. Kids will eventually eat a balanced diet. She speaks from personal experience.Childhood food memory: ""I'm a child of the generation who grew up with food shortages, so we were told to clean our plates and think of the starving children in China, India, or wherever. To this day, I can't break that habit. I still eat everything on my plate. It was just as well my mom was a good cook. She made great borscht, rugella, and sweet-and-sour cabbage.""Food lessons: For more than 30 years, Lansky has been dispensing parenting advice to American families, including down-to-earth, commonsense suggestions on feeding young children. ""My son started on solids at three weeks old, that was the thinking back then,"" admits the best-selling author. ""When my daughter arrived, I waited a bit longer, but she never would eat soft food. She went straight from milk to finger food. They're both perfectly healthy eaters today. My son has traveled the globe and eaten off the floor of the world.""Visit Vicki's website: practicalparenting.comThe No-Nonsense NutritionistEllyn Satter, mom of three, grandma of six, is author of Secrets of Feeding a Healthy Family and Child of Mine: Feeding with Love and Good Sense. ""It's the parent's job to plan meals, cook, and get dinner on the table,"" says Satter. ""Here's what some parents may have a tough time getting their heads around: A child is responsible for what, how much, or even whether he eats.""Childhood food memory: ""When I was 4, my mother had to go away on a trip, and I had this coven of aunts who felt sorry for me and looked after me by feeding me strawberries in great vats. I ate so many, I got the worst case of hives. To this day, strawberries equal love  not hives  to me.""Food lessons: A dietitian, social worker, and therapist, Satter's reputation for helping families handle eating issues is firmly rooted in what she refers to as her responsibility of feeding philosophy. ""You make a variety of foods available  don't limit the menu to only the food your child will eat,"" says Satter, who has dispensed advice on food to families for decades. ""Then let the child decide what to eat. Take 'no' for an answer, and set the tone for a calm, pleasant mealtime environment without pushing or pressuring.""Visits Ellyn's website: ellynsatter.com"

Tips for traveling with babies and toddlers,https://www.babycenter.com/0_tips-for-traveling-with-babies-and-toddlers_6993.bc,"Travel with a baby or toddler can be exhausting. Not just because you have more stuff to pack  it takes a mental adjustment, too.Those days of lolling about on the beach or having a late dinner at a nice restaurant are long gone. Now your vacation will be spent chasing pigeons with your toddler in a city park or hitting the early-bird special before your baby's 7 o'clock bedtime.Here are some tips for getting the most out of your time away from home.Plan a flexible itineraryOrganize the trip around your baby's schedule, not yours.Keep the number of pre-arranged and prepaid excursions to a minimum, and be willing to cancel or alter your plans at the last minute. An all-day package tour may seem like a great way to see the sights, but you don't want to be trapped on a tour bus if your child gets sick or has a screaming fit.Take it easy on the first dayAfter a long day on the road, you'll all need some time to unwind. Use your first day and night to help your family get used to new surroundings. That includes adjusting to new beds, strange sounds, and unfamiliar faces.Explore the neighborhood, check out the hotel's facilities, or just spend time sitting around the living room catching up with relatives. Follow your child's lead: Your toddler will want to check out every nook and cranny where you're staying before he feels completely comfortable.Make time to talk to your toddler about what to expect in the coming days, too.Rent or borrow baby gear whenever possibleYou're already lugging around a very young child. Why add a car seat, stroller, or portable crib to the load when you don't have to? Instead of hauling your own gear, consider renting what you need.Most vacation destinations are well-prepared for visiting families, and you'll dins companies that make renting high-quality gear convenient and affordable. You can rent cribs, strollers, highchairs, backpacks, swings, and countless other kid necessities.Another option: If you're staying with friends or relatives, try to arrange ahead of time to borrow baby equipment from your hosts or a neighbor.Use on-site childcare servicesTreat yourself to a few hours of adult time. Most vacation spots offer childcare ranging from group daycare services to one-on-one babysitting at night.If you're staying with friends or relatives, you may be able to call on them when you need a break. Keep in mind that as much as grandparents may enjoy spending time alone with their grandchild, they shouldn't be made to feel like your full-time babysitters. Childproof your roomThe first thing you should do when you reach your destination is make sure your room or suite is safe for your child. Many hotels and resorts will sn't available, bring electrical outlet covers, doorknob covers, and pipe cleaners with you to secure any loose drapery and electrical cords.If your room has a balcony, you'll need to put up something to prevent your child from falling over the side such as protective screening, a gate, or a barricade of chairs and sofas at the door. Check the carpet by crawling on your hands and knees in search of pennies, buttons, pins, and other choking hazards that may be hidden from view.Rent a place with a kitchenSaving money on food is just one benefit of preparing your own meals. You also won't have to put up with the wait at a restaurant or worry about your child disturbing other diners.You can store milk and other perishables in the refrigerator (some hotels will empty the minifridge at your request). Plus, you can satisfy your baby's palate  and his mealtime schedule  with minimal fuss.Go to casual restaurantsIf you do go out to eat, call ahead to make sure your child will be welcome. If you can, eat early to avoid the dinnertime rush. Restaurants with an open kitchen, fish tanks, or other attractions can keep toddlers entertained.In the United States, a restaurant that doesn't have highchairs or booster seats is sending a clear message: We don't like to serve kids. Try to steer clear of places with tablecloths, too, since your child may not be able to resist pulling them off."
How to enjoy a plane trip (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-enjoy-a-plane-trip-ages-5-to-8_67603.bc,"As with many parents of young children, your fear of flying may have nothing to do with the airplane and everything to do with appeasing a restless, noisy, or frightened child at 10,000 feet. In close quarters. In front of strangers. But with careful and creative planning, you can help ensure that tensions don't rise when the airplane does.Here are some kid-tested suggestions from travel experts  flight attendants, travel agents, and frequent-flying parents  for air travel with children:Booking your flightIn her 28 years as a flight attendant for a major carrier, Chicago-based Cheryl Kinkead has witnessed countless parenting successes and disasters. One thing she suggests: Arrive early so you can have your seats preassigned. Otherwise, you risk being separated from your child on a full flight.Reason number two to arrive early: Bulkhead seating. Many parents swear by these front-of-the-plane seats because of the increased legroom and proximity to the lavatories. Normally, these seats are reserved for premier travelers until the day of the flight, when any remaining available spots are up for grabs. But bulkhead seats have their drawbacks, too. For one thing, says San Mateo, California-based travel agent Lani Leydig, there's no under-seat storage; if you request bulkhead seats, say goodbye to your carry-ons until the ""fasten seat belt"" sign disappears. (And some parents aren't thrilled about being face-to-face with the movie screen for the whole flight.)Every major airline offers special meals for children, but most require notification at least 24 hours before takeoff. Kid's menus feature recognizable items like peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and burritos; some airlines even offer restaurant-sponsored fast food meals. Your child will likely prefer one of these options to ""mystery meat"" and rice. (Parents can order kid's meals, too.)Nonstop flights are preferable in most cases, since there's only one ear-popping descent to worry about. (Some kids have a hard time coping with the uncomfortable pressure changes that accompany landing.) Also, with nonstop flights you avoid the hassle of lugging everything  and everyone  to a connecting flight. But depending on the length of your flight and the temperament of your child, you may want to schedule a layover. Some parents find that splitting international or long domestic flights into two legs is helpful; their kids can enjoy a brief change of scenery and stretch their legs.If you're catching a connecting flight, New York-based travel agent Rabia Shahenshah suggests budgeting at least an hour for each connection. If possible, avoid peak flying hours. The emptier flights depart late at night, during the mid-afternoon, and early in the week. If avoiding potential delays is a high priority for you, consider booking the first flight of the day.Most important, view the journey from your child's eyes as much as possible. What time of day would be best for him? Will he be tired enough to sleep? Too excited to sleep at all? You're the expert when it comes to your child's personality and scheduling needs. Before takeoffWhile you wait to board, you want your child to expend as much of his energy as possible before he boards the plane, so that he'll either sleep or relax during the flight. Let him run around as much as he wants now  your fellow passengers will appreciate this later.Some airports (Seattle, San Jose, Pittsburgh, Chicago, and Boston) have ""KidsPorts"" play areas complete with blocks, slides, crawl spaces, and the like. If you find yourself in one of these kid-friendly airports, it's important to establish a time limit for your child right away. Keep reminding your child that it'll soon be time to go  this may forestall problems later.Most important, make a pit stop before boarding to avoid making too many trips to the tiny airplane bathrooms. If your child says he doesn't have to go, tell him to try anyway. It could be 30 to 45 minutes before he'll have another chance.Managing behaviorWhen you're watching the airplanes through the airport windows, it's a good time to help calm an anxious child's fears about flying and to help him feel comfortable with the transition from ground to air, suggests Georgie Chambers a mother of three from Davis, California. Your child will look to you for reassurance that he'll find a safe and friendly atmosphere inside the plane. If you're scared to fly yourself, have someone else discuss the flight with your child, says Duane Brown, author of Flying Without Fear.Also, reiterate your travel plans to your child. Remind him where you are going and what you are going to do there, so he knows what to expect. This is a good time to talk about behavior on the plane. If you anticipate your child being particularly troublesome, try using the reward system to manage his in-flight behavior: Explain that he'll receive a special treat  a gift, some special time spent together, or a trip to an ice cream shop  if he's good.Joanne Gigantino, a mother of two with 30 years of experience as a flight attendant with a major carrier, says that most pilots enjoy showing off the cockpit to curious young passengers. It's best to stop by the cockpit before the flight, Gigantino says. This is an especially good time for children who are afraid of flying to meet the pilots  seeing how the plane works will help demystify the experience and calm your worried child. During the flightOnce the flight is underway, have your child dip into his on-flight bag of entertainment (Gameboys and Walkmans are especially popular with this age group) you've packed. Most important, take an active interest in what amuses your child.On long flights, of course, the airlines provide movies that have been edited for family audiences. But not all airline entertainment is appropriate for children, Kinkead warns. Another thing to consider: Some children are not yet tall enough to see the screen over the airplane seats. If you're lucky enough to fly in a select Boeing 747, 767, or 777, the seatbacks sport mini television sets featuring the Disney and Discovery channels. Your family entertainment needs are fulfilled.In the confines of the cabin, it's wise to be a little more lax with discipline than you would normally be. Conduct that you ordinarily wouldn't tolerate, if it's relatively quiet, is preferable to the outburst waiting to happen if you deny your child's wishes to, say, play with his food.If your child does reach the boiling point, remind him that he stands to lose his good-behavior reward. If he doesn't cooperate, it's important to follow through with discipline: Once he learns that Mommy and Daddy are softies in public, his behavior in these situations will only get worse.Barring any outbursts, the most difficult part of the flight is the descent. When the plane reaches 8,000 feet, the pressure inside the ears is higher than the cabin pressure, and our ears start to pop. Explain to your child that he'll feel better when his ears pop, and then teach him to stretch his facial muscles and move his jaw to relieve ear pressure. To have some fun while doing this, you can play a game where you make faces at each other. Make sure to have a juice box or gum ready for him, since swallowing or chewing will also help.Back at the gate, it pays to wait while other passengers file out of the plane. The cabin staff will most likely help those bringing up the rear  and the kids. And, if you missed the cockpit while boarding, you may be able to catch a glimpse and get a tour.Bon voyage!"

Quitting smoking during pregnancy: Five keys to success,https://www.babycenter.com/0_quitting-smoking-during-pregnancy-five-keys-to-success_1405724.bc,"When Jennifer L. gave up smoking, she didn't just go through withdrawal  she went through agony. ""I felt like the world would fall apart if I didn't get another cigarette,"" says the 25-year-old college student and mom. She snapped at her 3-year-old son. She argued with her husband. She felt grumpy all day. And whenever she caught a whiff of cigarette smoke, she suddenly wanted a cigarette like a starving woman wants a meal. But no matter how rough the cravings got, she never lost her resolve. It's amazing how pregnancy can focus a person's mind.""I had to remind myself that I was doing it for her,"" says Jennifer, who quit smoking three weeks into her pregnancy and gave birth to a healthy daughter. ""My babies are going to grow up and make decisions for themselves. At least I can do this one thing for them and give them a good start.""You may already know how hard it is to try to quit: the cravings, the irritability, the powerful urge to have ""just one more"" cigarette. And now that you're pregnant, you know that quitting has never been more important. Even if you've failed at kicking the habit in the past, you can do it this time. About 40 percent of all pregnant smokers manage to quit, a success rate far better than that of other smokers. Still, plenty of pregnant women continue to light up, putting their babies at risk for stillbirth, premature delivery, low birth weight, and other complications.What separates the quitters from the women who continue to smoke? As a group, quitters aren't stronger or smarter than smokers, and they don't love their babies more. They've simply set themselves up for success. Different people take different approaches to kicking the cigarette habit, but a few winning strategies stand out. Here's a look at the top five keys to quitting smoking. Inside pregnancy: How smoking affects your babyA 3D animated look at how inhaled cigarette smoke can make its way through the placenta and affect the fetus.Plan aheadGiving up cigarettes isn't as easy as crumpling up your last pack and throwing it away. You need to plan for the challenges that lie ahead. Most successful quitters set a ""quit date"" and make it public by telling friends, family, and co-workers. Gary Tedeschi, the clinical director of the California Smokers' Helpline, suggests picking a special red-letter day such as a birthday or an anniversary. But don't wait too long. Your baby needs you to quit as soon as possible, so next Tuesday may have to be special enough.Once you've established the ""when,"" it's time to think about the ""how."" Ask yourself if you're ready to quit cold turkey or would prefer to cut back gradually. Brandi Boggie of upstate New York took the gradual approach, going from ten cigarettes a day to one or two and then to none at all. (Luckily, her morning sickness kicked in as she was giving up those last cigarettes. It was much easier to quit, Boggie says, when even the sight of a cigarette made her nauseated.) If neither approach is working for you, consider getting counseling or asking your doctor about nicotine replacements or other quitting aids.Whatever approach you take, you'll need to plan ahead for cravings. Cravings only last a few minutes, so your plan doesn't have to be too elaborate. Jennifer L. would chew a piece of gum or grab something to eat. Joy Dewell, a 29-year-old mother in Montana, took walks. Anything that distracts your mind for a few minutes can help you resist the call of that next cigarette.Get support from people around youGiving up cigarettes is much easier if you don't try to go it alone, says Laura Hamasaka, a smoking cessation specialist with the American Legacy Foundation. ""Social support from friends and family can double a smoker's chances for success,"" she says.Don't wait for support to come to you  ask the people close to you for help. If you know an ex-smoker, plan to give her a call when a strong craving hits. If your friends or family members smoke, ask them not to light up in front of you. Brandi Boggie's husband agreed only to smoke outside, and he kept his promise even when the temperature dropped below zero. Shivering outside may be noble, but it's still not the ultimate show of support. If your partner smokes, encourage him to give up his habit, too. Talk to your doctorNo matter what your approach to quitting, a conversation with your doctor can make the difference between success and ""better luck next time."" If you're trying to quit without nicotine replacement or other aids, your doctor can recommend a counseling program or at least give you some much-needed words of encouragement. If you want to try a quitting aid, such as a nicotine patch, gum, or spray, or the medication Zyban, your doctor can help you choose a method that's right for you.Don't let your first conversation about smoking be your last. If you're still a smoker when your next appointment rolls around, be sure to tell your doctor. Even if you're feeling ashamed or embarrassed, it's crucial to be honest for your baby's sake. Your doctor will want to pay extra attention to the growth and development of your fetus, and she can help you prepare for your next attempt to quit. And when you successfully kick the habit, don't keep it to yourself. It might be the best news your doctor hears all day.Keep reminding yourself why you're quittingGiving up cigarettes can be miserable work. If you don't feel strongly motivated to quit, you'll have a hard time resisting that first craving, Gary Tedeschi says. ""Smokers need to be very clear about their reason for quitting,"" he says. ""Motivation has to be clear and personal. You have to know why you're putting yourself through something that's very difficult.""Joy Dewell found her motivation in a pile of pregnancy books. She read up on all of the dangers of smoking, and she never let those dangers get far from her mind. ""Being educated about the risks really helped me,"" she says. Amanda Lowe, an expectant mother living in Georgia, kept telling herself that she'd never have a better reason to quit. ""I just knew that if I couldn't quit while I was pregnant, I never would,"" she says.Don't give upYou have a plan. You have the motivation. Your partner, doctor, and a support group of friends and family are on your side. Now it's up to you. You have to be stronger than the pull of nicotine. If you can last two weeks without picking up a cigarette, your withdrawal symptoms will start to fade and your cravings will become less and less intense. If you give in to those cravings, you'll have to go through the whole miserable process all over again.But if you do pick up cigarettes again, don't get down on yourself or lose sight of your goal. Most smokers quit several times before they give up the habit for good. ""Don't consider yourself a failure if you relapse,"" Gary Tedeschi says. Think about the positive: If you went a week without smoking, that's one week that your baby wasn't exposed to the toxins in cigarette smoke. And with the lessons learned from your first attempt, you're even better prepared to quit again.Joy Dewell admits she took a few puffs from a cigarette shortly after she quit, but she didn't get derailed. She fought off her cravings, kicked her habit, and gave birth to a healthy boy in 2001. A local antismoking organization asked her to run with the Olympic torch on its way to Salt Lake City for the 2002 winter games, so she carried the torch on a freezing winter day while her son watched from the side of the road, wriggling in his dad's arms. It's only fitting that little Elijah was there in her moment of glory. She couldn't have made it without him."
25 ideas for an amazing family staycation,https://www.babycenter.com/0_25-ideas-for-an-amazing-family-staycation_10412188.bc,"Definition of a staycationMerriam-Webster Unabridged defines it as ""a vacation that is spent at home or close to home"" and says the word was first used in 2005. Urban Dictionary goes a little further, describing it as ""a vacation that is spent at one's home enjoying all that home and one's home environs have to offer.""One thing's for sure: Staycations are here to  well  to stay. Why? We can only speculate, but it seems likely that the stress and expense of life today and the limited leisure time for modern families play major roles.Advantages of a staycationA vacation at home can be the perfect getaway for families with young kids. There are some serious advantages to using your vacation time without leaving town.Think about it:You don't have to pack  yay!You avoid the pain of long lines and crowded flights or fighting traffic and surviving hours on the road with small chidren.You decide where to be and when  with no pressure if you change your plans to accommodate a cranky child or simply decide to do something different. You spend quality time with your little ones.You can get some much-needed rest and relaxation yourself.You discover new and fun aspects of your hometown and nearby areas.You save money  possibly lots of money.Ground rules for staycationsA staycation can be tricky: If you're not careful, it can devolve into a week of fussiness and cries of ""I'm bored!""Good planning is essential. It can make the difference between a staycation to remember and just staying home.Start by getting on the same page with your partner  and your children, if they're old enough to participate in the planning. Here are some things to agree on well before you start your staycation:Is work allowed or not? You or your partner may need to check in on work (catch up on email, call into a meeting, and so on) during your staycation. But for the sake of group harmony, establish guidelines in advance and block off a good chunk of time every day that will be free from work distractions.What's the policy on phones and other devices? It's also important to put limits on phones, tablets, the computer, and the TV. To keep your devices from taking over your staycation, limit their use  or ban them completely, at least during the day.How will you handle cooking and cleaning? It's not a vacation if one parent (or both) is busy cooking and cleaning up after everyone else. Plan ahead for how you'll handle meals. If possible, go out to eat, order in, or make special meals together. (This can be a fun staycation activity!)What about big household projects? This is not the time to clean out the garage, organize the pantry, or declutter the closets  unless you decide to make such projects part of the staycation fun.Who's invited? Will your staycation be for immediate family members only, or will you invite friends or relatives to join you in some activities?When are breaks? As on any vacation, things will go most smoothly if everyone has some unscheduled time to nap or relax alone if they wish. Decide when you want everyone to be together, and when grownups and kids will have downtime.25 things to do on your staycationPlay tourist. No matter where you live, there are probably local landmarks you never visit because you never think of them, because you went once 10 years ago, or because they're ""for tourists."" A staycation is the perfect time to put this thinking aside and shamelessly pretend you're from somewhere else. Go ahead  check out the corn maze or the historic part of town or ride the double-decker sightseeing bus together. You could even visit your local visitor's center for ideas. See a factory. Some factories offer free public tours that are fun and educational. Search online for something like ""factory tours for kids"" plus the name of your state or area to locate the ones nearest you. Nationwide, you'll find family-friendly tours of factories that make everything from crayons, kites, or candy bars to guitars, ice cream, teddy bears, or trucks.Visit a police or fire station. Many police and fire departments do outreach to school groups and will let you and your kids stop by for a visit. Some even hand out stickers, do a meet and greet, and let children check out the equipment. Climbing aboard a fire truck is a delight for all ages!Bake or cook together. Baking and decorating cookiesor making a big, special meal together can be lots of fun. Choose something that isn't too stressful or complicated and has steps kids can do. Rice Krispie treats, homemade granola or granola bars, smoothies, soups, and lasagna are easy to make and include plenty of measuring and mixing kids can help with. If you hate to cook, you can buy prepackaged dough for cookies and focus on decorating.Plant something. Kids love to get their hands dirty and see the magic of growing things. Whether you have a garden or just a few pots for plants, you and your children can create and nurture something beautiful. Visiting a local nursery for ideas and to buy pots, seeds, and plants can be a staycation excursion in itself.Ride bikes (or scooters or tricycles). No matter how your child likes to get mobile, your staycation is a good opportunity to take a long ride. If your child is ready, you can use this time to teach him how to ride a bike without training wheels.Have a scavenger hunt. You can make this as simple or complicated as you like, depending on your child's age and your time and interest level. If your child is younger, have her search for objects of different colors or shapes at home or when you're out and about. Or, have a people-watching scavenger hunt where your child has to find a man with a mustache, a baby, and someone wearing a hat, for example.For older kids, there's a vast bounty of scavenger hunt ideas and printable lists online. You can set up a hunt in your home, in your street, in a park, or even in the grocery store. Try a photo scavenger hunt, in which your child takes a picture of the items he finds  or a reverse photo scavenger hunt, I which you show your child a photo of something that she has to find (and photograph) herself. There are also pretty cool online scavenger hunts (search for ""google earth global scavenger hunt for kids"" to find one).Take a nature walk. Whether you're at a nearby wilderness area or just your local park, there's plenty for you and your child to explore in the great outdoors. Try climbing trees, making daisy chains, or collecting flowers, leaves, or pretty rocks to display at home.Have a garage sale. This is a great project for older children to help you with. Give your kids a cut (or all) of the proceeds and watch them get to work cleaning out those closets and toy bins! Kids are also good at making signs and pricing items before the big day. Your garage will be cleaner, and your children will learn the joy of earning their own money.Do good deeds. Why not make giving back part of your staycation? Some families like to create ""care kits"" or ""blessing bags"" filled with small essentials like clean socks, snack bars, bottled water, and toiletries to give to homeless people they encounter. You could also gather used clothes and household items to donate to a local shelter or nonprofit.See your area's best attractions. This seems obvious, but we can't leave it out. Make sure your staycation itinerary includes cool amusement parks, water parks, children's discovery museums, beaches, zoos, or aquariums near you.Hit the library. In addition to free books, audiobooks, music, and movies, many libraries have children's programs like story time and arts and crafts for younger kids and computer skills for older kids. Go to museums. If there are ""grown-up"" museums in your area that you haven't visited with kids, now's the time to give them a try. You may be surprised by which artists appeal to your children and why.See a matinee. Few things say ""I'm on vacation"" like going to a movie in the middle of the day. Take a stuffy on an adventure. If you have elementary-school-age kids, you may have hosted a classroom stuffed animal for a week. (Each child takes the stuffy with him everywhere, snapping photos and writing journal entries about what they did together.) It can be fun to have a similar ""staycation stuffy"" travel around with you. Your children can document his adventures with your family.Play critic. Visit and rate your local attractions, such as playgrounds and restaurants. Older kids especially love to play critic. Have your kids rate places based on service, ambiance, quality, and other factors.Take advantage of drop-in activities. Though you may usually visit paintball, laser tag, mini-golf, trampoline, and bounce house places for birthday parties and other special occasions, they often have drop-in hours. For a pretty reasonable fee, you'll have a super-fun morning or afternoon.Get crafty. A staycation can be a nice time to dig into a craft project. For little kids, pull out the fingerpaints, playdough, and markers. Plan a few seasonal crafts or keepsakes to make together, like ornaments or prints of your child's hand. (Look online for ideas and good deals on craft supplies.) Teach your child how to sew, knit, or crochet (or learn together!). If you have older kids, let them tackle something bigger, like painting a room or drawing a mural. If you're not crafty or don't want to deal with the prep or mess, see if there's a local children's museum or paint-your-own ceramics place where you can get your creative juices flowing. Become an expert. Have kids choose something they love or want to learn more about. It could be penguins, baseball, rainbows  pretty much anything. Then, use some of your staycation time every day to delve into the topic. For example: If it's penguins, you could visit an aquarium one day, draw pictures of penguins or color printable coloring pages the next day, visit the library to check out books on penguins the next day, and finally have a bake sale to raise money for a wildlife conservation group.Go to a game. If there's a major or minor league team or a university or college in your area, head to a game. It can be fun to check out a sport you've never seen ""live"" before (tennis, field hockey, soccer, a swim meet perhaps?).Have a family game day. If your family loves to play board games, card games, or charades, make a day of it.Camp in the living room or backyard. Set up a tent in the yard and enjoy s'mores and stargazing. Or, make a tent out of sheets and camp inside.Have a spa day. Give your child a bubble bath, do each other's nails, let your child try on some of your makeup  it can be a soothing way to relax and bond. If you want, you can look up recipes online and make your own beauty products, like face masks and hair treatments, from items in your fridge and pantry.Learn a new skill. Maybe you've always yearned to play the guitar, your partner wants to make perfect waffles, and your child dreams of being able to do a cartwheel. Devote your staycation to learning a new skill  you can help each other find expert sources to learn from, motivate each other, and give feedback.Tackle a big project. Make sure everyone in your family is on board before deciding to spend your staycation on ""work."" But if everyone agrees, you may have a wonderful time taking care of a big task like painting rooms or making scrapbooks of family memories."
Baby showers: Top trends,https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-showers-top-trends_10338329.bc,"The ladies-only baby shower format of serving finger foods, playing silly games, and opening gifts is a beloved tradition, but it isn't set in stone. And more current shower trends let hosts customize the parties to fit the needs and personalities of the parents-to-be. Here are some ideas that are freshening up the baby shower scene. The green showerNew parents are going green in all sorts of ways  and baby showers are no exception. ""Green is in, and I think green baby showers are a great idea,"" one BabyCenter mom says.Requesting ""gently used"" items as presents is one way to green up a shower. ""My husband and I decided that we would get only what we really needed versus all the extra baby stuff. And I think 99 percent of this can be hand-me-downs,"" says one environmentally conscious mom. ""I begged people to either find something secondhand or get me a gift card to Goodwill,"" adds another.A few words of caution: It's a good idea to avoid used car seats. They may not meet current safety requirements, and it may not be apparent if a used car seat has been in a crash. If you receive a secondhand crib, first check to see if it was recalled by the Consumer Product Safety Commission. If not, make sure the slats are no more than 2 3/8 inches apart, and buy a kit to test for lead if there are layers of old paint Some parents choose to work on creating a single group gift to avoid all the wrapping and packaging waste. For example, Maureen Smithe enjoyed a ""knitting shower."" Her guests received knitting instructions and created squares for a baby blanket. ""I can't imagine a more thoughtful gift for my newborn son,"" Smithe says.Other earth-friendly ideas include giving out flowering plants for favors, serving locally grown food, sending digital invitations, and wrapping the presents in recyclable or reusable material such as newspaper, cloth diapers, or baby blankets instead of store-bought wrapping paper. The man showerThere's no reason dads shouldn't have some fun too. Kaity Pursino of Invitation Consultants Inc., an online invitation company, says the man shower is a growing trend, and the ""Diapers for Dad"" theme is especially popular.""We had a man shower,"" says mom Cathy Biermann. ""My husband invited his friends to come over for a guys-only party. We provided beer and barbecue, pulled out the poker table, and the guests brought diapers. We ended up with enough diapers to last us nearly eight months!""Sip and seeSometimes an expectant mom isn't up to having a big party before the baby's born, but would welcome the company  and the chance to show off her new baby after the fact. A sip and see shower is held once mom and baby are settled at home and ready for visitors. It's a chance for friends and family to meet the new baby and raise a glass in her honor.For this type of gathering, both men and women are often invited, and there's typically little or no decorating or games. Gifts may be optional.At a sip and see shower, plan to offer light snacks, champagne or sparkling cider for the toast, and other drinks if you like. The time is often flexible  more like an open house  so the new parents can spend more time with individual guests.A bonus of the sip and see party: New parents don't have to entertain a constant stream of visitors over the next few weeks.The sprinkleSprinkles are smaller showers often held for the second (or third or fourth) baby. The guest list is usually shorter, and gifts are generally not as elaborate as the ones at a first baby shower. Practical supplies, like diapers or baby food, are more common.""My sisters are throwing a little sprinkle for me,"" says one mom. ""Basically, it's a diaper shower. We're just going to enjoy food, socialize, and have a good time."" Another great option? A shower to stock the freezer, meaning guests bring frozen meals for the family to have on hand after the baby is born.Some sprinkles involve handmade gifts. ""I held a sprinkle for my best friend, who was having her second boy,"" says one BabyCenter mom. ""I threw it at a paint-your-own pottery place, and everyone made a ceramic tile for the baby's room."" The cash registry showerExpectant parents who have all the baby gear they need  or who have their eyes on a fancy crib  may choose to register for cash instead of gifts. Online cash registry companies that offer cash coupons have sprung up to accommodate this trend. Guests purchase the coupons online, where they can see what the parents are planning to buy with the money.""The company I used, Deposit a Gift, had me post pictures of what I was planning to buy, much of which wasn't available at the more conventional baby stores,"" says first-time mom Marie-Angie Vassallo. ""So my shower guests got to choose what they wanted to contribute toward, and their coupons reflected that.""In this sense, it doesn't sound too different from a traditional registry. The big difference? The parents exchange the coupons for cash  not the item itself. If they change their mind about that lime green changing table, no problem  they simply buy something else.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015. Choosing a crib.

Managing holiday travel with your child,https://www.babycenter.com/0_managing-holiday-travel-with-your-child_10375002.bc,"In addition to being synonymous with food and festivities, the holidays are the busiest travel time. If your plans this season include trekking to your relatives' distant homes, you can make family travel easier by getting your children involved from the start.If you're traveling by car, have your child help plan the route to Grandma's house. This will fuel her excitement and teaches her important skills such as planning and prioritizing. You can also help your child prepare a travel pack filled with tapes or CDs she can listen to, pen and paper she can draw with, and a collection of her favorite mess-free foods. You may want to advise her to skip reading in the car, however, since this can bring on carsickness. (Read more on how to enjoy a family road trip.)If you're traveling by plane, arrive at the airport early so your seats can be pre-assigned. Otherwise you risk being separated from your child on a full flight. Plus, getting to the airport early gives you a better chance of getting bulkhead seats, which provide plenty of room for your child to move around and for you to stretch your legs and relax.If your 5-year-old's a picky eater, call the airline at least 24 hours ahead to request a kids' meal. If what's on the menu isn't your child's cup of tea, you can pack her favorite foods in your carry-on luggage. (See our tips on making plane travel easier for the entire family.)"
Dads today: More than Mr. Mom,https://www.babycenter.com/dads-today,"Forget the idea of a bumbling, hapless Mr. Mom, fumbling through changing diapers, panicking at the thought of bottle-feeding the baby, or recoiling in horror at the notion of giving his toddler a bath. Today's dads are engaged, view themselves as every bit Mom's equal, and are sick and tired of being pilloried in the media.It's time fathers get some respect.That's the overwhelming message of a major new study of fathers conducted by BabyCenter and Men's Health. The survey of 1,319 parents, completed between May 6 and May 14, 2013, included 559 fathers or expectant fathers, and discovered some important changes when compared with a similar study done by BabyCenter in 2006.Three-quarters of fathers now say they were, or plan to be, at home for several days immediately following the birth of their child, doing chores and attending the baby  triple the number from 2006. Also, while 3 in 5 dads say the idea to have a child was made jointly with their partners, a quarter say the pregnancy was unplanned, a threefold increase from seven years ago.Dads on callOverall, fathers report being very active in all phases of pregnancy and childbirth. Eighty percent of men attend most of their partner's doctor appointments; three-quarters are always accessible by cell phone during the pregnancy; and two-thirds said they give their partner massages. Three out of 5 dads say they cut or plan to cut their baby's umbilical cord.Still, the survey revealed some interesting generational shifts. Most dads take one to two weeks off following the birth of a child, but a father's age does make a difference. The number of dads under 30 who view one to two weeks as standard for paternity leave is a third higher than the number of dads over 40. Twice as many dads under 30 said they plan to take up to four weeks off.The bottom line: Nearly two-thirds of dads say they're more involved in the physical aspects of caring for their children  changing diapers, making meals, giving baths  than their dads were.As one father said in a follow-up conversation, ""Anyone can be a father, but it takes a man to be a dad. It's more than just providing; its showing your children how to be respectful, thoughtful, and overall a good person.""And Baby makes chaos? Not anymoreThe impact of having a baby on Mom and Dad's relationship also reflects a key generational shift. When asked if having a child drew them closer to their spouse or instead increased stress, 20 percent of 40-plus dads said it drew them closer, while a third said it increased stress on the relationship. For dads under 30, the numbers were reversed. This trend suggests the long-held belief that children were a drag on relationships may be changing.In more good news, the 2013 survey found that on a wide number of issues how much free time dads have, how overwhelmed their partners felt, as well as how overwhelmed they felt  dads today are less frustrated than they were in 2006.Some things, however, never change. The top three things dads do: Take care of the house (mow the lawn, change the light bulbs), take care of the car, manage the money. The bottom three things dads do: Shop for toys, shop for clothes, clean the home (mopping, sweeping, tidying up).One sign of discord is that dads believe they do more work around the house than moms give them credit for. Dads are 50 percent more likely to say they do the laundry; dads give themselves more credit for helping with the children; and dads are a third more likely to say they do at least half of childcare at home.Does having a baby harm Dad's career?A central argument in Lean In, the bestselling book by Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg, is that working moms can't fully succeed unless they have partners who share a large percentage of childcare. Moms can't lean in at work, in other words, unless dads lean in at home.On that front, dads say they already are. Asked, ""Do you consider yourself an involved dad who does at least 50 percent of the childcare in your home?"" fully 87 percent said yes. When asked if they would make career decisions based on their parenting obligations, half of the fathers said they would sacrifice a promotion at work if it meant spending less time with the family.These results do not change by generation. Fathers of all ages simply accept that both parents are balancing home and work. Two-thirds of fathers in all age groups say, ""We both have careers and take care of the kids equally.""A higher percentage of younger fathers, though, appear to embrace this reality. When given a choice of the reasons they are so involved with their kids, the vast majority of dads opted for ""It's important to me. I want to be a great dad and close to our children."" And that number is increasing among young fathers. Sixty-one percent of dads over 40 picked that answer, which rose to 79 percent among dads under 30.As one dad said, ""I changed my career to be home more for the family. Being a dad is the most important thing in the world.""Dads in the mediaThe survey did detect one strong area of dissatisfaction. Dads are annoyed by how they are portrayed in the media. Asked how they feel about the spate of recent reports suggesting involved dads are a trend, the fathers in the survey pushed back. Half said being an involved dad isn't a trend; it's just the way things are. But a third said there hasn't been enough media attention on the evolving role of fatherhood. ""We're ignored!"" they said.Some, meanwhile, said they were frustrated by lingering stereotypes. As one observed, ""I love how close I am with my daughter, and my wife really appreciates everything I do for them. But the, 'Oh, you're spending the day with Dad' comments piss me off. I usually respond, 'That's called every day.'""Bruce Feiler writes a column on contemporary families at The New York Times and is the author of The New York Times bestseller The Secrets of Happy Families: Improve Your Mornings, Rethink Family Dinner, Fight Smarter, Go Out and Play, and Much More.

Secrets of successful moms: Homeschooling and raising a large family,https://www.babycenter.com/0_secrets-of-successful-moms-homeschooling-and-raising-a-large_10346300.bc,"An artist, blogger, painter, and mother of six (that's right, six) kids from ages 5 to 13, Denise is the queen of multitasking. In addition to managing a household of eight, the Southern California mom homeschools her three oldest boys  Noah, 13, Diego, 12, and Solomon, 10  teaches art, and does duty as a baseball mom. There's no such thing as a set-in-stone schedule in the Cortes family. But within the swirl of noise, chaos, laundry, and huge grocery bills, this 38-year-old mom is obviously doing something very right.See Denise's photos and answers to our top schedule questions.Read Denise's blog posts.How she does it: Mom Denise Cortes' daily scheduleI'm the type of person who avoids schedules. One of the main reasons I homeschool is because I enjoy having freedom in our daily lives. Having my younger kids in a charter school has forced me to schedule our days somewhat, but it's been good for us. It's forced me to stop burning myself out.My younger kids go to school Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. My older three are home. Tuesdays we all go to a co-op and my kids take various classes and I teach art. In about two weeks we'll start baseball season, which means practice four days a week and games every Saturday. This is a typical Monday:7:00 to 7:30 a.m.I wake up and put on my workout clothes even though I can't find time to actually go and work out. Start on lunches7:30 to 8:40 a.m.Wake up my three younger kids. Help my girls get dressed (we already have clothing battles  at 5 and 6 years old), do hair, serve breakfast. My husband will squeeze juice or make smoothies. My older boys will wake up and straggle in at some point.8:40 a.m.Younger kids off to school. Usually my husband is home so he drives them. If not, I drop them off.9:00 to 10:00 a.m.Begin a load of laundry, if my chronic bed-wetter hasn't already put his sheets and blankets in first. Make beds (mine and my girls). Make sure my older boys are doing their chores (they have to make their beds, empty all the trash cans, put their laundry away, and make sure the kitchen is tidy). I put laundry away and check email, blogs, and Twitter. Then I shower.10:00 a.m. to12:30 p.m.Schoolwork. They do math online, but together we work on language arts, history, and science. They practice guitar, jump on the trampoline, write stories, paint, and draw. Throughout our mornings I multitask and sweep floors, put away clothes, scrub the stove, and wipe down walls in between helping with sentence structure, checking science facts, watching history videos, and so on.12:30 to 1:30 p.m.Lunch. It's a free-for-all. We eat leftovers, make our own sandwiches, or eat a frozen pizza. My boys usually make their own meals. I am back on the computer or I'll set my alarm and take a nap. The boys go online, watch cartoons, or play video games.1:30 to 3:00 p.m.Try to finish schoolwork. This is when I need to drink a cup of juice or coffee because my energy and patience level begins to dip around 3.3:00 p.m.Clean up school supplies.3:15 to 4:15 p.m.Pick up younger kids from school. If I have errands to run, I fit them in now. I'll go to the library and return books, go to the post office, and run to the grocery store to pick up things for dinner, all with my three kids in tow.4:15 to 5:00 p.m.If I didn't get to nap earlier in the day, this is when I do it. I have to set my alarm or I'll oversleep. I let my younger kids watch cartoons on my bed and I'll lie sideways at the end of the mattress and all three of them will massage my back with their little feet.5:00 to 7:00 p.m.Make dinner. I cook pretty much every day. As I'm cooking I'll do more laundry, and sometimes we'll get started on my younger kids' home study packet (which we're responsible for on Tuesdays and Thursdays). I'll referee squabbles over the Wii, or the kids will be running in and out of the house, playing with each other. We eat dinner together every day at the kitchen table  no TV allowed. I also don't allow my kids to eat in their rooms or in front of the computer.7:00 to 8:00 p.m.Bathe and groom my daughters. Spend time talking with my husband about his day. My older sons are responsible for cleaning up the kitchen after dinner, so I bark at them to stop fooling around and get it finished already!8:00 to 9:00 p.m.Supervise showers for the boys. I'll let my kids watch a movie, play with dolls, read, draw, build forts, or run around and play tag until I want to tie them down to their beds. In the meantime I'm trying to clean up random messes around the house.9:30 p.m.Bedtime. Hallelujah!9:30 to 10:30 p.m.After everyone is in bed, I relax with my husband, drink a cup of herbal tea, fold more laundry, maybe watch something on TV with him. Then we say, ""We should just go to bed."" But we don't. He goes off in search of his artistic pursuits and so do I.10:30 p.m. to 1:00 a.m.I blog; edit; paint; draw; read blogs; plan meals and schoolwork for the next day; and finally sort, wash, fold, and put away more laundry.1:00 a.m.In bed."
How to get an hour back every day,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-get-an-hour-back-every-day_10347621.bc,"Free time? What's that? Was there really an era when the washing machine wasn't in constant use, when you could have a spontaneous night on the town, when you didn't fall into bed each night in a state of near-clinical exhaustion?Nowadays, your ""me"" time may be restricted to a few brief moments in the bathroom. The good news is that thanks to these timesaving ideas from real moms, you can get a little of it back. A spontaneous night out? Maybe not. But doesn't a nice magazine break on the couch sound nice?Make weekly menus. No guessing what to cook at dinnertime and no last-minute store runs.Freeze sandwiches on Sunday to carry you through the week. Every morning, pop a sandwich in the lunch bag and you're good to go.Plan clothing. I set my daughter's entire outfit (including her hair bow!) out the night before.Use a shared online calendar (color-coded for home, school, and work) to stay in sync with your partner.If you work, do errands on your lunch hour. I can get grocery shopping, picking up dry cleaning, and going to the post office out of the way and avoid going on nights and weekends.Put your kids to bed earlier. It's counterintuitive, but my girls sleep better (and wake up later the next morning) when I put them to bed a half-hour earlier.Don't argue over clothes  as long as they're weather-appropriate, I don't care what my kids wear.Multitask. I always clean the bathroom while my son is in the tub.I make lists so I don't wander around trying to remember things. My memory is shot.Wake up before the kids to shower and dress. I'm more motivated when I'm not in my pj's.Cook lots of one-pot meals on Sunday and freeze for the week.I create monthly menus and shopping lists and never stray from them.I have outfits ready in plastic bags so my daughter just has to pick a bag and get dressed.Use to-do lists! I feel accomplished when I scratch something off, and that motivates me.Prepare the night before. Yes, I'm exhausted, but I know that I'll breeze through the morning if I devote time after the kids are asleep to making lunches, putting homework in backpacks, and signing field trip permission slips. I also shower, pick out my outfit, and prepare my bag for work.Alternate layers of rubber and regular sheets on kid beds for easy bed-wetting cleanup.Cook baby food for the week, freeze it in ice cube trays, and pop it out for quick meals.I don't fold my kids' clothes. This makes putting laundry away so much faster.Buy all the same color socks and you'll never have to match them again.Rotate toys in and out of storage to avoid clutter and boredom. This way, your kids will actually be excited to play with their own toys when you need to get stuff done.Getting up 20 minutes before the kids keeps me from feeling behind all day.I pay bills on my phone and do paperwork in the car while I'm waiting to pick up my kids.I keep a box ready for too-small clothes and other things to donate to charity. I throw things in as I notice them, rather than having to go through all my kids' clothes and toys later.My grocery list is a spreadsheet of items organized by the layout of our supermarket.Use checklist apps on your phone to keep track of things like your grocery list.I keep packages of wipes everywhere. They clean up almost everything quickly.Keep shoes organized so you're not searching the house for them. In our house, each person has a labeled bucket for shoes. They go there and nowhere else.I have a to-do bag that I carry with me, so I can take care of business when I have a moment.Each kid has stuff in ""her"" color (jacket, lunch box, school folders, backpack) so I can easily keep track of whose things are whose.I keep a freezer inventory  it's a spreadsheet listing all the frozen items we keep on hand (and how many we have), taped to the freezer door. Whenever I use something, I mark it on the spreadsheet. One quick look at the freezer and I know exactly what I can whip up for a quick dinner for my family of five.Teach your kids to help where they can. Chores can start young. My 4-year-old helps me put away shoes, sweep, and dust.I keep healthy snacks in a snack basket where the kids can reach them. That way, I'm not making snacks all day.Keep toys to a minimum. Each child has one bin of special toys and that's it. This way, I spend less time putting lots of toys away, organizing them, and weeding out ones to give away.I take a power nap when I can  just 20 minutes refreshes me and helps me be more productive for the rest of the day.I never watch TV without a basket of laundry to fold in front of me.I'm not a morning person, so I give my children alarm clocks and have them wake me up.I have a chore schedule for myself and I do only the designated chores on that day. That way I don't get distracted by other things I ""should"" be doing.Sometimes the best thing I can do for dinner is order in.Absolutely no TV on weekdays. If it never happens, it's never an argument  so we don't waste time negotiating and bargaining.My kids help out with laundry  we make a parachute game out of folding sheets.Once they hit elementary school, have your kids participate in making a schedule for your morning routine. We held a meeting to brainstorm a list of tasks and talk about who should do what. Then we decided on an order in which the tasks should be completed. This way, my kids are more motivated and feel responsible for getting to school on time.Speed things up with music. High-energy tunes motivate my kids to get moving in the morning. I like Abba's ""Dancing Queen"" and ""Mamma Mia.""Manage everything online. I use online bill pay for everything, and get bills and bank statements electronically. This is so much faster than opening mailed bills and statements and paying them by hand. Make your partner pull his weight. We created a list of all the household tasks that have to get done every day and divvied them up. Yes, it's a chore chart  but it works!My kids love simple things: food, togetherness, laughter. If I remember that  and let go of doing everything perfectly  we can get it all done."
Breaking the cycle of emotional eating,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breaking-the-cycle-of-emotional-eating_10352383.bc,"Do you celebrate with a decadent dessert when you're happy, dive into a bag of chips when you're stressed, and bury your sorrows in a tub of ice cream when you're depressed? Chances are, you're an emotional eater.Most of us begin placating our feelings with food before we're even able to talk, when our wails are silenced with a bottle or breast. From that moment, food becomes a psychological coping mechanism.""Certain foods increase the amount of neurotransmitters in your brain and induce other biochemical changes that provide comfort,"" says Susan Albers, a psychologist at the Cleveland Clinic and author of Eating Mindfully: How to End Mindless Eating and Develop a Balanced Relationship to Food.But eating is only pleasurable to a point, says Albers: ""When you nibble past feeling full to stuffed, comfort quickly turns to discomfort."" It takes 20 minutes for your brain to recognize that your stomach is filled with food. Trouble is, in 20 minutes, you may wolf down a gallon of ice cream and then you feel sick.Write down what you eat""Snacking may distract you temporarily from your worries,"" says Albers. However those underlying feelings come right back until you find a healthier way to manage them.Before you can break the cycle, you have to identify which emotions trigger your binge eating. Write down everything you eat and how you felt before, during, and after you ate it, says Christine Gerbstadt, national spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. Were you hungry or just bored? Were you happy or sad?After a few days, you'll have a good idea of which emotions send you straight to the kitchen. What's more, writing down what you're about to eat and how you feel buys you time to figure out whether you're truly hungry or you're just trying to soothe yourself.How to prevent binge eatingInstead of relying on an emotional or physical cue to eat, try eating before you get hungry and plan out four to six meals a day, suggests Gerbstadt. ""For each meal and snack, eat a mix of protein, carbohydrates, and fat, so the foods you eat keep you satisfied."" Once you establish a habit of eating smaller portions throughout the day, you won't be as vulnerable to overeating.Build time into your day for physical activity. A study tracking frequent snackers found that those who went for a brisk five-minute walk when they felt frazzled were much less likely to grab a candy bar than those who sat at their desks. Experts claim that walking can help lift serotonin levels and make you feel less anxious.Arm yourself with a list of things to do instead of eating and post it on the refrigerator. ""Each time you have the urge to stress eat, pick another calming activity like taking a bath or going to the park,"" says Albers. The trick is to retrain your brain to get its needs met without food.7 binge-busting strategiesBefore you put anything in your mouth, write it down. Simply writing it down will make you slow down and assess whether you're really hungry.Use smaller serving bowls and plates.Repackage foods in smaller snack containers.Never eat straight from a package or ice cream tub.Store tempting foods out of sight and in inconvenient locations (like a basement or top cupboard).If there's a food in the house you can't resist, throw it out!Allow yourself a small serving (150 to 200 calories) of your favorite food before the urge to overeat strikes. Then go for a walk.Show sources Hide sources Thayer R. 1987. Energy, tiredness, and tension effects of a sugar snack versus moderate exercise.

Helping an overweight child (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_helping-an-overweight-child-ages-5-to-8_66927.bc,"I think my child might be overweight. How can I tell if it's a problem?You're right to be concerned: Carrying extra weight can put your child at risk for health problems like heart disease and diabetes now and in the future. By elementary school, most kids have grown out of their baby fat, so schedule a talk with your child's doctor. She can help you determine whether your child's weight is a problem that you should start addressing now.How will the doctor determine whether my child is overweight?Your child's doctor will measure his height and weight and plot these numbers on a growth chart. Doctors today are using a new series of growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that take into consideration a child's body mass index, or BMI, which indicates whether his height and weight are proportional. The BMI is a better indicator of whether your child is carrying too much body fat than a weight measurement alone. While the BMI of an adult is calculated with a straight formula, children's BMIs are based on gender and age, to allow for the change in body composition that happens as a child gets older.Like a standard growth chart, your child will be ranked in percentiles compared to his peers. If your child's BMI is in the 85th percentile  meaning it's higher than that of 85 percent of children his age and gender  he would be considered overweight. If he's in the 95th percentile, he's considered obese.In addition to your child's height and weight, his doctor will factor in how much his parents weigh, how long he's been heavy, and his overall health.If my child is at risk for becoming overweight, what can I do about it?Doctors don't usually recommend restrictive diets or weight loss programs for children, as they're necessary only in extreme cases. In fact, a restrictive diet can be harmful to a child's health and interfere with his growth and development if it's not carefully monitored. Instead, your child's doctor will most likely want you to work with your child to improve his eating habits and his activity level.Ask your doctor for suggestions on how you can help your child develop healthy eating habits. She may suggest that you follow the Food Guide Pyramid, which advises offering your child three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit each day, in addition to servings of whole grains, milk, and meat. Of course, you'll want to limit sweets and other high-calorie, low-nutrient foods. The doctor may also recommend that you consult a registered dietitian to help you create a balanced eating plan for your child.Keep in mind that if the whole family is eating healthy foods for each meal and snack (and enjoying plenty of exercise), your child will find it much easier to do the same.Help your child steer clear of these bad habits, all of which can cause him to gain weight:Unsupervised snacking. Limit or eliminate choices like chips and cookies, and replace them with healthy options like fresh fruits and vegetables and low-fat puddings, yogurts, and cheeses. Make sure your child isn't grazing all day, either, even on healthy foods.Eating while watching television. A child who's distracted may not recognize when he's full. Help your child learn to listen to his body's signals to tell him when he's had enough.Consuming excessive amounts of soda or juice. Save soda and other sweet beverages for special occasions, if you serve them at all. Fruit juice does count as a serving of fruit, but too much juice can fill your child up so that he won't be hungry at mealtime for the other nourishing foods he needs. Limit juice to about 6 ounces per day.Indulging in vending-machine food. Most vending-machine food isn't very nutritious. If your child is going to be out and about at snack time, pack something healthy for him.Spending too much time in front of the TV or computer. Kids can get sucked into sitting still for hours. In addition, TV advertisements encourage the consumption of high-calorie, nutrient-poor ""junk"" foods. To encourage physical activity, keep TVs out of children's bedrooms.Eating too much at meals. See our expert's advice on how to handle overeating.Instead of nagging or ridiculing your child about his weight, which is likely to make him resentful and rebellious, give him the opportunity to choose healthy foods and activities, and praise him for it when he does. And don't forget to set a good example by eating well yourself. ""Especially for young children, the importance of parents' modeling healthy eating and healthy lifestyles can't be overemphasized,"" says Krebs. ""Children learn what they see!""Don't start subjecting your child to regular weigh-ins at home, either  they can become a source of anxiety. However, if your child's BMI is above the 95th percentile, your doctor may ask to see him once a month to monitor his progress. Just treat these visits like any other trip to the doctor, and don't make a big deal about the weigh-in process. Keep the focus on developing healthy habits, rather than on your child's weight. How can I encourage my child to become more active?Exercise is a key component of weight maintenance, and many kids don't get enough of it. The 2000 Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recommend at least 60 minutes of activity per day for kids  ideally, done with their parents. Instead of settling on the couch after dinner, encourage your family to take a walk or bike ride together. Try in-line skating or dancing. And look for ways to be more active throughout the day  by walking or biking instead of driving, for instance, or by taking the stairs instead of the elevator. For most children, encouraging more time outdoors is all it takes to get them to have more active playtime.What if my child remains overweight as he grows up?You can help improve your child's future by showing him how to eat better and become more active now. This will boost his chances of heading off a weight problem and growing into a healthy adult. Even if he never achieves a ""normal"" weight, he'll be healthier if he eats well and is active."
Top 10 baby shower gifts,https://www.babycenter.com/0_top-10-baby-shower-gifts_5387.bc,"A baby shower is a great time for soon-to-be parents to receive the gifts they need to help them get ready for parenthood. Here's our list of top ten baby gifts worth giving new parents.Baby libraryA shelf full of classic children's books is a gift sure to win any parent's heart. Some favorites are Goodnight Moon, Runaway Bunny, and Guess How Much I Love You?.If you love the idea of giving books, consider making it the theme of the shower: Have everyone bring their favorite with a note to the baby tucked inside. Be sure to mix some baby-friendly board books in with the traditional hardcover variety  that way newborns will be able to truly appreciate the sound and the taste of your gift.Baby sling or carrierOne of the easiest ways for a new parent to tote a baby around is in a sling or front carrier. Babies love the warmth and feeling of being snuggled up close to Mom or Dad, and the ingeniously simple design leaves a parent's hands free to do housework or errands while their little one sits safely in a makeshift pouch.Baby ""on-the-go"" essentialsIf you're a parent  or even if you aren't  you know it's virtually impossible to get out of the house without leaving something behind. Help the happy new parents avoid mishaps with a bag full of baby essentials.Start with a diaper bag; add a couple of diapers, some wipes, an extra outfit (or two) for the baby, a bottle of ready-to-feed formula (if she's formula feeding), a couple of small toys (rattles and chew toys are perfect), and a pacifier. If you want, toss in a movie or other gift just for the new parents.Baby bath gearFor a gift that's fun and practical, grab a baby tub and fill it with all the things a new parent needs to keep a baby squeaky clean. Include baby shampoo, a mild soap that won't irritate a newborn's sensitive skin, a soft washcloth (or sponge), a hooded towel, and a bright yellow rubber ducky for good measure.A baby comb and brush are nice additions, as are a couple of simple bath toys, even though an infant won't be able to really play with them for several months. Toss in a bottle of bubble bath for Mom or Dad to use when the baby's asleep, and you're done.Baby beddingSoft, fitted bottom sheets are a perfect addition to any nursery. You'll find colors and patterns to suit every family, from traditional pastels dotted with baby animals to bold black-and-whites and geometric patterns. You can be sure that any new parent will be grateful to have extra linens come laundry day.(Fuzzy blankets pair nicely with sheets, but save them for out-of-the-crib cuddling, as soft bedding is a potential SIDS risk.)Baby sleep kitA basket full of things that make the nursery more soothing after dark can help a new parent survive those first few sleep-deprived months. Fill your sleep kit with a comforting nightlight, a soft blanket, and some soothing music made just for babies (For Crying Out Loud and Lullaby: A Collection are great examples). If you want to splurge, include a white noise sound machine or a special mobile that plays music and projects dancing light pictures on nursery walls.Baby monitorNervous first-time moms and dads will appreciate the reassuring presence of a portable baby monitor receiver on their bedside table. These gadgets have become more and more sophisticated  some models can pick up a baby's faintest breaths within a range of 600 feet or more. Other options include motion sensors that sound an alarm if the baby hasn't moved in a certain period time, and video monitors, which let parents see and hear their baby.Baby bouncy seatKeep a newborn (and parents) happy with a bouncy seat  the baby can wiggle and jiggle to his heart's content, and parents can squeeze in a chore or two knowing he's safe and entertained. This versatile, portable piece of baby gear features cheerful fabric stretched across a metal or plastic frame, with straps to ensure safety. Some models are battery powered for a rhythmic and more soothing bounce.Baby activity gymBabies are enthralled by their environment in general, but you can make it even more fascinating with an activity gym  a contraption that typically includes a cloth mat and toys suspended from soft bars or arches. Colorful mirrors, noisemakers, and other objects of different shapes, sizes, and colors dangle within the baby's grasp, encouraging his developing eyesight and growing physical skills. Portable and lightweight, activity gyms are travel-friendly, whether you're shuttling between rooms or across the country.Comfort foodNothing soothes the nerves of exhausted parents more than a warm and delicious homemade meal. But when the beds are still unmade at 5 in the afternoon and the baby's having a good end-of-the-day cry, the last thing a new mom or dad wants to do is cook. So give new parents what they really want  dinner on someone else.Before you go to the shower, organize a group of the parent-to-be's friends to volunteer to make dinner for the new family after the baby's born. Depending on the number of people involved, you can plan to have hot meals dropped off either nightly or every few days for the first couple of weeks postpartum."
Eight ways to survive and even enjoy the holidays,https://www.babycenter.com/0_eight-ways-to-survive-and-even-enjoy-the-holidays_5648.bc,"The holidays are different when you're a parent. Decking the halls is fraught with potential peril as you weigh the pros and cons of hanging (poisonous) mistletoe and (breakable) ornaments. And the blinking floor-to-ceiling Christmas tree or lighted menorah is a disaster waiting to happen in the wrong (small) hands. Then there's the pressure to make the holidays a magical time for your family. Is it any wonder that stress levels rise at this time of year?Fortunately, it is possible to preserve your sanity and still have a holiday to remember. Here are some ways to keep your spirits bright:Scale backCheck your Martha Stewart impulses at the door and accept that you can't do everything. You can't even do almost everything with a new baby or toddler in the house. Unless you've got lots of household help, you'll probably want to skip marathon cookie-baking sessions, extensive household decorating (do you really need to create handmade holiday wreaths this year?), and sending out holiday cards to everyone in your address book. Friends and family will understand if you're feeling overwhelmed this year. Save your time and effort for the years down the road when your child will really be ready to appreciate the season.Simplify gift givingVery young children appreciate the attention that comes with gift giving, but they probably don't need as many presents as you think. ""I always overbought when my kids were young,"" says Catherine Chambliss, professor of psychology at Ursinus College in Pennsylvania and mother of four. ""I wanted to give them everything, but they didn't want everything. I learned that when they got tired of opening gifts I could put the extra presents in the attic for next year.""The Hiers, in Cornish Flat, New Hampshire, resolved to keep their Christmas low-key and their holiday meals informal. For their daughter Jaime's first Christmas, they bought her a bright red wooden sled and spent the day pulling her up the hill behind their house. ""It was a gift we could share with her,"" says Gar Hier. ""She was rosy-cheeked and thrilled all day.""Still looking for that perfect gift? See our list of toys appropriate for your child's age.Reconsider travelEven if you've always traveled to visit family for the holidays, you may want to change your plans while your kids are young. Many families with small children prefer to avoid holiday air travel with its delays, baggage restrictions, and security requirements. Consider asking family members (and friends) to come to you instead. Hosting a low-key holiday with a few loved ones can be a much saner way to spend the season, and you might discover some new holiday traditions.Avoid family conflicts""People often feel that they must resolve in one day all the unfinished family business that they weren't able to resolve in the previous 364 days,"" says John Garrison, director of stress management programs in the department of psychiatry and behavioral medicine at Lahey Clinic in Burlington, Massachusetts. ""We usually suggest that families declare a truce over the holidays and focus on having a good time rather than fixing relationships.""But if you've just about had it with your mother-in-law's critique of your Thanksgiving meal, try practicing this basic stress management technique: Take a deep breath, hold it for a moment, and exhale slowly. If you're religious, saying a simple prayer can help head off a fight. ""Prayer not only has spiritual benefits, but can also help reduce the 'fight or flight response' that is a basic component of stress,"" says Garrison.Collaborate on festivitiesHost a cookie swap in which everyone brings one huge batch of cookies and leaves with a variety in equal amount preferably enough to stuff several gift baskets. Invite your guests to bring hors d'oeuvres or desserts to your holiday party instead of trying to do all the cooking and baking yourself.""My mother always had to have everything perfect before the guests arrived,"" recalls Sherry Darrow, mother of two boys under 5, ""and every year she ended up feeling harried and put upon."" Darrow invites her guests to come early and help make dinner. ""It's disorganized,"" she says, ""but everyone gets into the fun of cooking together and we share the day in a way we don't have time to the rest of the year.""See the holidays through the eyes of your childA walk outside to see the holiday lights in your neighborhood or attending the public lighting of a menorah or Christmas tree may be all the excitement your child is ready for. Moderation is key remember, babies are oblivious to the meaning of the holidays and young children discovering the world for the first time are easily delighted. ""It's nice for children to have a memory of cookies baking,"" says psychologist Chambliss, ""but there doesn't have to be a month of it.""Create sustainable traditionsChoose traditions that are easy to revisit every year, such as going for a hike on Christmas day or driving through festively lighted neighborhoods at night. If the rituals you choose require too much time, space, effort, or money, the stress of keeping them going can take over. Instead, settle on traditions that create time for togetherness.In their first years as parents, the Chamblisses aimed high - too high. ""We had these 14- and 15-foot-tall trees that made us feel like children again,"" says Catherine Chambliss, ""but the kids couldn't relate to them."" The huge trees took a full day to put up, anchor, and decorate - and then the Chamblisses worried about the kids' safety. Since then they've adjusted to the idea that Christmas can feel just as special with a petite, manageable tree.Give yourself a breakFinding time for yourself is almost impossible this time of year, but if you do, you're more likely to relax. And if you're relaxed, your children are also more likely to enjoy themselves. ""Small children are exquisitely sensitive to a parent's mood,"" says Chambliss.Schedule time for yourself, even if it means getting out a pen and writing it into your calendar. Do whatever makes you feel refreshed - hiking, having coffee with a friend, reading a book, taking a bubble bath. (See How Mothers Stay Sane.)Finally, don't pretend to be jolly if you don't feel that way. Memories, good and bad, tend to resurface at this time of year. ""Most people have some sad and negative feelings during the holidays,"" says Peter Carnochan, a San Francisco-based psychologist. ""This is okay. Don't force yourself to be merry."""
Top tips for a day at a children's discovery museum,https://www.babycenter.com/0_top-tips-for-a-day-at-a-childrens-discovery-museum_65321.bc,"For the youngest preschoolers, a children's discovery museum offers the tactile experience of a lifetime  a place where they can indulge their natural desire to open, close, push, pull, and touch. Three- and 4-year-olds, with their growing imaginations, will find plenty of opportunities to pretend.Increasingly interested in cause and effect, 5-year-olds find a museum the perfect place to explore the whys and becauses of the world. And 6- to 8-year-olds are attracted to interactive exhibits, which offer brain-teasing challenges.Jenny Burch, chief development officer at the Children's Museum of Indianapolis, and Jhoanna Wade, a journalist and mother of a young museum fanatic, offer these tips for making the most of a visit to a children's discovery museum.Before you goCheck the website.As with any expedition, a little planning can make the adventure more fun. You can unearth the best exhibits for your child's age and interests on the museum website.Look for age-specific exhibits, especially any on subjects your child currently finds fascinating  trains or dinosaurs, for example. With even a bare-bones itinerary in place, you'll have plenty of time for good, old-fashioned discovery. Tip: To avoid disappointment, call the museum the day before your visit to make sure any exhibit you're really hoping to see isn't out of commission.Check online for admission prices and ticket purchase, hours, where to park, special exhibits, and amenities. You may want to see whether the museum offers stroller rentals or lockers and coat checks where you can stash your gear while you wander.Dress kids appropriately.Be sure to outfit them in clothes that can weather some real discoveries  something you and they won't mind getting wet or dirty. When it comes to shoes, think comfort, since they'll be spending plenty of time on their feet. And go with layers  you don't want to have to leave the museum prematurely because a child is too hot or too cold.When to goChildren's museums bustle during school breaks in the spring, winter, and summer. Like you, other parents are taking advantage of the holidays.To avoid long lines, get admission and special exhibit tickets online or ahead of time. (Additional fees may be charged for temporary exhibits or scheduled events in permanent galleries.) Museums plan for these busy times and may add additional activities, so check on that as well.During the school year, classes often tour between 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. If you have the opportunity to go on a weekday, try for late afternoon, when the exhibits are less crowded. Sunday mornings are a quieter time to visit as well.Once you arriveHit outdoor exhibits or parks first.If the museum has an outdoor play area  or even if it's close to a park  spend a little time there first to let your child run around and blow off steam. This will help your child focus on the exhibits instead of racing around.Review the floor plan.Locate restrooms, snack areas, and your must-see exhibits on the map. You may even want to make a prized exhibit the last stop on your tour: If your child knows the locomotives are the big finale, it may be easier to leave the rest of the fun behind when it's time to exit.Look for water.Many kids love anything to do with water. So if your child hasn't led the way, you might want to point out exhibits with splash appeal.Turn the experience into an informational treasure hunt.Come up with 10 questions based on the exhibits. You can come up with these before you go, based on the website, or while your child is engrossed in something at the museum. Some examples of questions: What color is the male loon? What's the name of the largest dinosaur that ever lived? Be sure to ask things that pre-readers can figure out the answers to without having to read displays.Not only does a treasure hunt keep an easily overwhelmed child focused on the exhibits at hand, but it helps him retain information about his discoveries.Look for age-appropriate activities.This way, your child is engaging in an activity he can truly learn about and enjoy, and he'll also have an easier time interacting with other visitors: Kids are most comfortable interacting with children their own age. If the website doesn't specify age-appropriate galleries, ask the staff which ones best suit your child's age.Count on deviating from the plan.Even if you've plotted the perfect path through the museum, you should still follow your child's lead. Your child, who previously showed no interest in mummies, for instance, might want to spend some extra time exploring the Egyptian exhibit she suddenly finds irresistible.You may want to gently remind her of other things in the museum, but don't force her to move on if she's really enjoying himself.Talk with the educational staff.Generally, museums station volunteers or employees at the exhibits. They are ready, willing, and eager to share information and answer questions.Ask about services, any services.The staff members know the needs of kids and parents. If your child gets doused at the water table, the staff may have air dryers or a change of clothes available. Camera or phone battery low? The staff just might be able to charge it for you or direct you to a charging station. It's also possible there's a nurse on duty.Hands-on protocol.While many children stay with their parents, some older kids might be making the rounds without adults. If unsupervised children are monopolizing a display, politely ask if your child can have a turn. Or ask museum personnel for help.Time your exit.There's a world of information to explore, so if your child often gets tired and cranky around 2, plan the big finale for 1:30, so you can both leave happy.If your child balks at leaving, offer to buy him a souvenir on the way out: It doesn't have to be expensive  even stickers will do  but it caps off the visit and serves as a fun reminder of the experience.What you might findExhibits vary widely from museum to museum. Be prepared for lots of physical, as well as mental, activity.Here are examples of what children might be doing, depending on what the museum offers, their age, and their interests: exploring an archeological dig, crawling through habitats of underground animals, examining a watershed table, playing in a fort or navigating a ship, preparing meals in a play diner, digging in sand, dressing in costumes of animals or characters.They'll also be pushing, pulling, and twisting buttons, dials, pulleys, and levers on exhibits demonstrating everything from physical science to engineering principles. Many museums have special areas designed for the babies, toddlers, and preschoolers.Think about steering your child to the role-playing exhibits, especially if he's been clamoring to do more ""grown-up"" things. From working a real ATM (at the Children's Museum of South Carolina in Myrtle Beach) to living in Kidtropolis, a huge pretend city (at the Children's Museum of Houston).What to take with youSnacks. Museums don't allow food or drink in the galleries, but they generally provide a snack area where you can break out the refreshments.A stroller. If your child is young enough for a stroller  or even a bit past the stroller stage  he may get tired before he's truly ready to leave. You can plop him in the stroller and tour around until he gets a second wind.A few toys and books from home. A favorite book can offer a much-needed break from all the newness and excitement.Bring the experience homeMany of the experiences in a discovery museum focus on the senses  the way things feel, sound, look. To create a fun sensory experience right at home, try this: Blindfold your child (or have her close her eyes) and walk her around the house, making noises she's used to hearing, like shutting the refrigerator door, opening a window, turning on the faucet.Have her guess what the sound is. If she guesses right away, try for more subtle sounds: the flick of a lamp switch, the raising of a shade. Then switch roles.The museum shop might have just the book on pyramids to satisfy your child's appetite for everything Egyptian. Often a museum's website lists books and videos tied to its exhibits, as well as games and crafts. And, if it's mummies your child is fascinated by, a roll of toilet paper goes a long way toward creating a child-size, living mummy.A fun factDid you know that dinosaurs could be named after people? One discoverer named the herrerasaurus after his buddy, Seor Herrera."
5 things you didn't know about breastfeeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_5-things-you-didnt-know-about-breastfeeding_10357141.bc,"Amlie Benoist / Science SourceBreastfeeding is like a hike through the woods: Natural, but not always simple. In fact, it can be challenging, breathtaking, and full of the unexpected.Here are the big breastfeeding surprises moms reported to us:The hormones can be intenseIt's the ultimate paradox. Here's this odd-looking creature sporting a belly-button stump, acne, and peeling skin. He can't even hold a decent conversation, let alone get you a cup of coffee  and yet whenever you nurse him, you're filled with head-over-heels devotion. What's up with that? We have one word for you  oxytocin.This powerful hormone is responsible for breast milk ""letting down,"" or moving to the front of the breasts. And it also happens to be the same chemical released in the brain when a person falls in love, says Laura Viehmann, assistant professor of pediatrics at Brown University and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatricians. No wonder you couldn't care less about all that spit-up and poop! You're too busy swooning.Another hormonal effect of nursing  particularly in the newborn period  is a feeling of deep relaxation, which can easily tip over into drowsiness. ""It's the same kind of sleepiness people feel after a big meal,"" Viehmann says. And just like that post-Thanksgiving sedation, it's difficult to resist. ""I can be wide awake and full of energy, but I sit down to breastfeed and I'm half passing out,"" says one mom.5 breastfeeding lessons learnedMoms share their breastfeeding experiences.Viehmann's advice? Recognize that the drowsiness has a purpose and give in to it, even if only for a ten-minute catnap. ""Research shows that mothers who take advantage of these small naps will achieve an extra one to two hours of sleep per day,"" Viehmann says. Just make sure you nurse in a safe place where your baby can't fall or get trapped in a cushion if you doze off.Unfortunately, not all the hormonal effects of nursing are positive. Some women report uncomfortable sensations before or during letdown, such as an uneasy feeling in the stomach, weakness, sweating, and even an odd sense of melancholy. These feelings are often temporary and can be replaced by more positive ones.But if you're concerned about how you're feeling, or if you're having problems with breastfeeding, don't hesitate to check in with your doctor.Breastfeeding helps (some) women lose their pregnancy weightAs your baby grows from a fragile-boned newborn into a delicious butterball, you may notice your own weight dropping. You can thank nursing for transferring those pounds.""Breast milk is a high-fat, high-caloric food,"" says Robert Wool, associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts University. ""And the baby basically sucks those calories right out of the mother's body."" Hence, the incredible shrinking mommy. As one mom says, ""The weight just fell off.""However  and unfair as this seems  the nursing weight-loss plan doesn't work for everyone. Some moms find their metabolism slowing to a frustrating crawl. ""I nursed my son for 27 months and it didn't help me lose weight. Then I lost 15 pounds within about two weeks after weaning,"" one mom reports.In fact, in a poll of BabyCenter moms, 40 percent say breastfeeding didn't help them drop pounds while 60 percent say it did. Is there a physiological difference between the two groups?Possibly, says Viehmann, although there's not a lot of research data in this area yet. ""One of the breastfeeding hormones is also involved in digestion. For some nursing women, this hormone may become more efficient, so they don't need as many calories,"" she says.Your breasts can leak  a lotWhen it comes to leakage, your breasts may seem to have tiny minds of their own, particularly in those early postpartum weeks. Like an internal alarm clock, they may dribble  or spray  milk when it's time for a feeding, says nurse and lactation consultant Claudia Perry. They may also leak whenever you hear your baby cry or, for that matter, when you hear any baby cry. Photographs, videos, or just thoughts of your baby can get that dairy faucet pumping.""Even baby animals and babies on television can set me off,"" one mom reports. Another says, ""At first, I couldn't leave the house without nursing pads because I knew the second I saw or heard another baby, or even thought about my baby, I'd leak everywhere.""Once again, oxytocin  the hormone responsible for your letdown reflex  is the culprit. Like a good party host, your body knows that it's better to have too much food available than not enough. While those wet spots on your blouse can be a bit embarrassing, think of the leaking as nature's way of making sure your baby always has enough to eat.Some women, says Perry, have occasional leaking long after they've weaned their babies  sometimes even a year later! It just goes to show that we should never underestimate the power of those hormones.You can be lopsidedFeeling a little uneven? It's not your imagination. Many moms find that one breast consistently produces more milk than the other. If this is the case for you, you can chalk it up to the fact that you have a different number of milk-making ducts on each side. ""Humans aren't perfectly symmetrical,"" says Perry. ""Just as one foot can be bigger than the other, one breast can have more ducts than the other.""Of course, what this means is that the more productive breast may be bigger as well as fuller. Again, this is normal. ""I am completely lopsided! Righty is way bigger than lefty  probably at least a cup size. I call the right side the workhorse,"" says one mom.You can also cause uneven milk production if you feed your baby more from one breast than the other. (The breast you use more will produce more milk.) But if you're giving each breast equal time and still noticing a difference in output, it's likely a duct issue.You can't change the number of ducts you have. The fuller side will probably remain more productive the entire time you nurse your baby  and it will likely be more productive for your next baby as well.Your breast milk is perfectly tailored to your babyImagine if every single time you were hungry, you were served a delectable, satisfying meal that contained the perfect balance of electrolytes, fats, and nutrients for your body at that particular time. Welcome to your baby's world.""The joke is that breast milk is a 'soup to nuts' meal,"" says Miriam Labbock, pediatrician and director of the Carolina Global Breastfeeding Institute at the UNC School of Public Health, meaning it's a full-course feast. ""The first milk is more watery, so it addresses the baby's thirst. As the feeding continues, the milk becomes higher in fat. It's like starting with broth and ending with a hot fudge sundae."" This setup allows your baby to get her electrolyte needs met at the beginning of the feeding and her energy needs met with the creamier milk at the end.In addition, says Labbock, starting with the watery part is easier on the baby. ""This allows the infant to avoid having to fight with the heavy cream right away,"" she says. ""The cream comes only after the milk is flowing nicely.""Amazingly, your breast milk gives your baby exactly what she needs immunologically as well. ""The components of the milk shift so that it always complements whatever antibodies the baby is low on at that particular time,"" Labbock says. This is why breastfeeding can actually keep your baby from getting sick.As if this weren't enough, your breast milk changes throughout the day, with more sedating properties being released in the evening. It also changes as your baby grows older to meet her ever-changing nutritional needs. In short, it's the perfect food. And judging from the look of drunken satisfaction on a well-fed baby's face following a feeding, it tastes pretty good, too.Show sources Hide sources La Leche League International. 2016a.

Iron in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-in-your-pregnancy-diet_1468.bc,"Why you need iron during pregnancyEven before you're pregnant, your body needs iron for several reasons:It's essential for making hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to other cells.It's an important component of myoglobin (a protein that helps supply oxygen to your muscles), collagen (a protein in bone, cartilage, and other connective tissue), and many enzymes.It helps maintain a healthy immune system.But during pregnancy you need a lot more of this essential mineral. Here's why:The amount of blood in your body increases during pregnancy until you have almost 50 percent more blood than usual. You need extra iron to make more hemoglobin.You need extra iron for your growing baby and placenta, especially in the second and third trimesters.Many women need more because they start their pregnancy with insufficient stores of iron.Iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy is associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight, and infant mortality.How much iron you needPregnant women: 27 milligrams (mg) of iron per dayNonpregnant women: 18 mgYou don't have to get the recommended amount of iron every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Food sources of ironThere are two forms of iron: heme and non-heme. Heme iron is found only in animal sources and is easier for your body to absorb. Non-heme iron is found in plants, iron-fortified foods, and supplements. Red meat, poultry, and seafood contain both heme and non-heme iron. To make sure you're getting enough, eat a variety of iron-rich foods every day.Red meat, poultry, and fish are some of the best sources of iron. (Liver supplies a very high concentration of iron, but it also contains unsafe amounts of vitamin A, so it's best to limit it to one or two servings a month during pregnancy.) If your diet doesn't include animal protein, you can get iron from legumes, vegetables, and grains.Strawberry and asparagus salad Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 4:02Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -4:02Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Adding just a little meat or fish to a meal helps your body absorb more of the iron in the other foods on your plate.Here are a few more tips for getting as much iron as possible from your diet:Cook in a cast iron pan. Moist, acidic foods, such as tomato sauce, are especially good at soaking up iron this way.Include a source of vitamin C (like orange juice, strawberries, or broccoli) with every meal, especially when eating vegetarian sources of iron, like beans  the vitamin C can help you absorb up to six times more iron.Many healthy foods contain ""iron inhibitors,"" which are naturally occurring substances that can interfere with iron absorption. Examples of iron inhibitors include phytates in whole grains and legumes, polyphenols in coffee and tea, oxalates in soy foods and spinach, and calcium in dairy products.If you have low iron or iron-deficiency anemia, some experts believe you shouldn't eat iron-inhibiting foods at the same time as iron-rich foods. Others believe it's okay to eat these foods together as long as your overall diet includes plenty of iron-rich and vitamin C-rich foods. Your provider or a dietitian can work with you to create a prenatal nutrition plan that supports healthy iron levels.If your provider has prescribed iron supplements, take them one hour before or two hours after meals because iron is absorbed most easily on an empty stomach. Taking the supplement with orange juice  which is high in iron-enhancing vitamin C  can boost absorption. (But don't take your iron pill with milk, coffee, or tea because these can interfere with iron absorption.)Calcium also hinders iron absorption, so if your provider has recommended you take both an iron and a calcium supplement (or antacids that contain calcium), ask for advice on how to space them out during the day.Should you take an iron supplement?Although your body absorbs iron more efficiently during pregnancy, you might not get enough of the mineral from your diet. Many women start their pregnancy without enough iron to meet their body's increased demands and are unable to bring their levels up through diet alone.At your first prenatal appointment, your healthcare provider will probably recommend a prenatal vitamin with about 30 mg of iron. Unless you have (or develop) anemia, this should be sufficient, so don't take additional supplements unless your provider advises you to.What happens if you don't get enough ironWhen you don't get enough iron, your stores become depleted over time. And if you no longer have enough iron to make the hemoglobin you need, you become anemic.Iron-deficiency anemia can sap your energy and cause many other symptoms, especially if you have a severe case. It can also make it harder for your body to fight infection.It may even impact your pregnancy: Iron-deficiency anemia  especially in early or midpregnancy  has been linked to a greater risk of preterm birth, having a low-birth-weight baby, and fetal or newborn death. See our complete article on iron-deficiency anemia.If you're anemic when you give birth, you're more likely to need a transfusion and have other problems if you lose a lot of blood at delivery. And some research suggests an association between maternal iron deficiency and postpartum depression.Your baby does a good job of taking care of his iron needs while he's in your uterus. He'll get his share of what's available before you do. That said, if you're severely anemic, it may compromise your baby's iron stores at birth, raising his risk for anemia later in infancy and possibly hurting his growth and cognitive development.Can you get too much iron?Yes. Aim to get no more than 45 milligrams of iron a day. If you take more than that (either from an extra iron supplement or from your prenatal vitamin), it can cause your blood levels of iron to rise too high, possibly causing problems for you and your baby.For example, too much iron can increase your risk of developing gestational diabetes or oxidative stress, an imbalance in the body that's thought to play a role in infertility, preeclampsia, and miscarriage, and has been linked to heart disease and high blood pressure. Take iron supplements during pregnancy only under the supervision of your healthcare provider.Side effects of iron supplementsIron supplements can upset your gastrointestinal tract. The most common complaint is constipation, which is already a problem for many pregnant women. Try drinking prune juice if you're constipated. It can help you stay regular  and is actually a good source of iron!You may also have nausea or (more rarely) diarrhea. If your supplement makes you feel queasy, try taking it with a small snack or at bedtime.Talk to your provider if you're experiencing other side effects  if you're not anemic and your prenatal vitamin has more than 30 mg of iron, it may make sense for you to switch to one with a lower dose.If you are anemic, you may be able to prevent stomach problems by starting with a supplement that has less iron and gradually building up to the dose you need. You could also try taking the iron in smaller doses throughout the day. Your provider may suggest trying different iron supplements to find one that's easy on your stomach. For example, some moms-to-be have fewer side effects from a timed-release iron supplement, although the trade-off is that the iron isn't absorbed as well this way.Finally, don't worry if your stools look darker when you start taking iron. That's a normal and harmless side effect.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015. Nutrition during pregnancy.

"Celiac disease, wheat allergy, and gluten sensitivity in kids",https://www.babycenter.com/0_celiac-disease-wheat-allergy-and-gluten-sensitivity-in-kids_10403347.bc,"What is celiac disease?Celiac disease is an autoimmune disorder that affects the digestive system. If your child has celiac disease, his immune system reacts to gluten  a protein found in wheat, rye, and barley  by attacking the lining of his small intestine. As a result, his body is unable to absorb nutrients from the food that passes through the damaged small intestine, and he may become malnourished.Celiac symptoms can appear as early as 6 months of age, after you start introducing your baby to solid foods that contain gluten. But it's quite rare for young children to have symptoms and most don't get diagnosed until later in childhood, often after age 10. Symptoms vary widely from one child to another, and can include chronic diarrhea, abdominal pain, bloating, constipation, poop that's oily or smells especially bad, gassiness, irritability, vomiting, weight loss or trouble gaining weight, and delayed growth. Some children may not show any signs at all.If your child has been diagnosed with celiac disease, you'll need to make sure that he avoids all foods containing gluten. Unfortunately, people don't outgrow celiac disease  your child will need to be on a strict gluten-free diet for his entire life. The good news is that after eliminating gluten, his symptoms should start to disappear, and his small intestine should heal within a few months.About 3 to 13 in 1,000 children have celiac disease. About 1 percent of people in the United States have been diagnosed with this condition, although many people go undiagnosed. Scientists believe that the disease is becoming more common. Celiac disease tends to run in families, so it's important for parents and siblings of a diagnosed child to be screened as well.If left untreated, children with celiac disease can develop complications such as iron-deficiency anemia, malnutrition, weakened bones, and short stature. There's a higher chance of developing other autoimmune disorders such as type 1 diabetes and Hashimoto's disease. There may also be a higher risk of developing gastrointestinal cancers and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.People with certain genetic diseases such as Down syndrome, Turner syndrome, and Williams syndrome are at higher risk of developing celiac disease.How is celiac disease different from gluten sensitivity or wheat allergy?Celiac disease, gluten sensitivity, and wheat allergy are often confused with one another, because they all involve an intolerance of wheat proteins, and many of the symptoms look alike. But they're very different conditions that are diagnosed and managed in distinct ways.Celiac disease is a serious but treatable autoimmune disorder. As long as your child completely avoids gluten, she shouldn't experience any symptoms or damage to her small intestine.Wheat allergy involves a different part of the immune system. If your child has a wheat allergy, her immune system has identified wheat proteins as an allergen. Whenever a child eats foods or breathes in substances that contain wheat, she has an allergic reaction that causes her body to release histamines. You may notice classic food allergy symptoms, such as hives, swelling or itching of the lips, rash, itching, wheezing, diarrhea, nausea, and vomiting. Symptoms appear within minutes or hours, and in some cases, can quickly become life threatening.Unlike kids with celiac disease, many children with a wheat allergy can tolerate other grains like rye and barley. So it's a bit easier to follow a wheat-free diet than a strict gluten-free diet. (Be sure to talk with your child's allergist about the foods your child can safely eat.) Like celiac disease, wheat allergy runs in families, but most children outgrow it by the time they're 18. Fewer than 1 percent of children have a wheat allergy.Gluten sensitivity, also called non-celiac gluten sensitivity or gluten intolerance, isn't a food allergy or an autoimmune disease. Researchers are just beginning to learn about this newly recognized condition, which may affect up to 6 percent of the population. People with gluten sensitivity have symptoms similar to those of celiac disease, and the symptoms improve once they begin a gluten-free diet.However, unlike celiac patients, people with gluten sensitivity seem to have no problems absorbing nutrients and should suffer no damage to their small intestine. Their blood also lacks the antibodies found in people with celiac disease. Unlike celiac disease, gluten sensitivity doesn't appear to be genetic, and so far scientists haven't found a link to autoimmune disorders or intestinal cancers.After eating foods with gluten, children with gluten sensitivity can have some of the same symptoms as kids with celiac disease  abdominal pain, diarrhea or constipation, and bloating  but they can also experience other symptoms, such as fatigue, headaches, and joint pain. Some may also have a diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).Scientists aren't sure whether gluten is the true culprit behind gluten sensitivity. Several recent studies suggest it may be caused by foods that are high in a group of carbohydrates known by the acronym FODMAP (fermentable, oligo-, di-,mono-saccharides, and polyols). These carbs  which include dairy, wheat, beans, and certain sweeteners, fruits, and veggies  tend to be hard to digest and may ferment in the gut and cause abdominal distress in people who are sensitive to them.It's unclear whether people with gluten sensitivity need to avoid gluten as strictly as people with celiac disease. While research continues, experts recommend that gluten sensitivity patients work closely with their doctor and dietitian to develop a personalized food plan that helps them stay symptom-free. How can I tell if my child has celiac disease, wheat allergy, or gluten sensitivity?Diagnosis can be tricky, since these conditions have similar symptoms. It's essential to have your child evaluated by a doctor. There are major differences in how these conditions progress and are treated, so it's important to know exactly what you're dealing with.Your pediatrician will do a physical exam, ask questions about symptoms and your family medical history, and may order blood tests. For the blood tests to be accurate, make sure that your child continues to eat as he normally does. Don't eliminate foods that contain gluten or wheat unless your doctor specifically asks you to.If your pediatrician suspects a wheat allergy, she'll refer you to an allergist, who will do a skin prick test, blood tests, or a food challenge. Your child might be asked to eat a small amount of wheat under medical supervision and be observed for an allergic reaction.If your pediatrician suspects a gluten problem, she'll refer you to a pediatric gastroenterologist. This doctor may order more blood tests and do an endoscopy, passing a long, thin tube through the mouth and stomach into the small intestine and taking a tiny sample of tissue. If the sample reveals damage to the small intestine, your child will be diagnosed with celiac disease.Gluten sensitivity is more difficult to diagnose. Currently, there aren't any tests available. If your child shows symptoms that suggest a gluten issue but wheat allergy and celiac disease have been ruled out, your doctors may suspect gluten sensitivity. Your gastroenterologist may recommend trying a gluten-free or low-FODMAP diet plan. If your child's symptoms improve, the conclusion is probably gluten sensitivity.You may be tempted to avoid an endoscopy and just go gluten-free if you suspect that your child has celiac disease. But it's crucial to get a diagnosis first. If your child does have celiac disease, you'll need help managing his diet safely and his doctor will need to monitor intestinal damage and bone loss.How can I make sure my child has a gluten-free diet?Diagnosis can be a relief, but for many families, going gluten-free is a big lifestyle change. Grocery shopping, managing a gluten-free household, and eating out can all feel daunting, but there are some good guidelines and resources for parents.Work closely with your doctor and dietitian to develop a food plan before making any changes to your child's diet. Gluten-free diets are a popular trend, but just because a food is gluten-free does not mean it's healthy. It's important to make sure your child doesn't miss out on any essential nutrients. Your dietitian can help you develop a nutritious eating plan that fits your budget and lifestyle, and can also give you recipes and suggest substitutes for your child's favorite foods.The goal is to stay away from wheat, rye, and barley, as well as additives that may contain gluten. Most pastas, pizza, crackers, cereals, breads, and baked goods are made using these grains.Learn to read food labels. When you're shopping, check ingredients and avoid any products that include gluten-containing grains, for example:Wheat and wheat varieties such as spelt, kamut, durum, graham, and semolinaWheat bran, wheat starch, wheat germ, cracked wheat, hydrolyzed wheat proteinBarleyRyeTriticaleMalt (unless it's derived from corn)Oats are naturally gluten-free, but many oat products are contaminated with gluten during processing. So its worth experimenting with oats that are labeled gluten-free, but be aware that researchers have found that that some celiac patients cant tolerate even those oat products.Be wary of prepared and processed foods. Gluten can be found lurking in unexpected places, such as store-bought stews and soups, soy sauce, processed meats like hot dogs and cold cuts, salad dressings, medications, vitamins, and even lip balms.Resist the urge to stock your kitchen with manufactured products. Gluten-free bread, cookies, and crackers tend to be more expensive and have added sugars, sodium, or fat to make them taste better. Whole foods such as meat and poultry, fish, fruit, vegetables, most dairy, and nuts are naturally gluten-free and healthier for your family.It's reasonably safe for your child to eat foods labeled ""gluten-free."" All products manufactured after August 5, 2014, that are marked ""gluten-free,"" ""without gluten,"" ""no gluten,"" or ""free of gluten"" must either be naturally gluten-free or have gluten levels of less than 20 ppm (parts per million) in order to comply with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) current rules.A gluten level below 20 ppm is low enough to be tolerated by most celiac patients and is also the lowest level that can be detected using scientific tools. If you're not sure how much gluten is in a food product, don't let your child eat it.Some products labeled ""gluten-free"" may include a warning that the item was made in a facility that processes wheat products, raising the question of cross-contamination. But as long as the product has gluten levels lower than 20 ppm, it meets the FDA's requirements and should be safe to eat for most celiac patients. For more information on gluten-free labeling, visit the FDA's web page on this topic.Eating out is trickier, but with some planning, kids who can't have gluten or wheat can still enjoy restaurants or eat at the school cafeteria. Before visiting a restaurant, check online or call ahead to see whether they offer gluten-free options. If a menu states that something is gluten-free, the restaurant must comply with the FDA's definition. Check with your regional celiac support group to see whether they have a list of restaurants that offer gluten-free menus or dishes.For school lunches, ask the principal about your options. Public schools are required by law to make reasonable meal accommodations for celiac patients on a gluten-free diet or kids who are at risk of having a life-threatening allergic reaction to wheat. Your child's doctor will need to provide confirmation of her condition. If you don't trust the cafeteria, however, you might want to pack your child's lunch.As for birthday parties and playdates, your child might feel left out if she can't eat what others are enjoying. Talk to her beforehand, and provide a special meal and dessert for her. Most parents will understand.For a list of foods to eat and avoid, tips on gluten-free food preparation, and advice on dining out, see the Gluten-Free Diet Guide for Families, by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.Where can I get more information?GI Kids: Children's digestive health information for kids and parents, by the North American Society for Pediatric Gastroenterology, Hepatology, and Nutrition.Celiac Disease Foundation: Overviews of celiac disease and treatment, practical diet tips, and support programs for children and young adults with celiac disease.

Best foods for new moms: Mood boosters,https://www.babycenter.com/0_best-foods-for-new-moms-mood-boosters_1458835.bc,"It's not uncommon to feel down for the first couple of weeks after childbirth. You're recovering physically from labor and delivery, dealing with postpartum hormonal swings, and adjusting to life with the newest  and most demanding  member of your family. All this can leave you feeling exhausted, cranky, and anxious.And while feeding yourself may be last on your to-do list, eating healthy food, having regular meals and snacks, and taking a few simple steps can boost yourenergy leveland your mood. Read on for our best nutrition tips.Editor's note: If you suspect you're suffering frompostpartum depression(PPD) rather than a temporary case of the""baby blues,"" tell your care provider right away.PPD is a serious condition that requires treatment. A healthy diet can improve your mood, but it can't substitute for professional help. Warning signs of PPD include insomnia, a change in appetite, weepiness or sadness that persists all day, and thoughts of harming yourself or your baby.Stock up on omega-3 fatty acidsExperts agree that omega-3s fatty acids  found mainly in fish and some nuts and seeds  are important to include in a healthy diet. They help your body function normally and protect against heart disease. And some studies show lower overall rates of depression (including a lower incidence of postpartum depression among new moms) in countries where people eat large amounts of fish.Pediatrician James Sears, coauthor ofThe Baby Book, advises new mothers to stock up on foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like wild salmon, flaxseed oil, and walnuts. He believes these enhance brain function and can help with depression. ""Omega-3 oils really help the brain work better,"" Sears says.The Institute of Medicine recommends women consume 1.1 grams (1,100 mg) of omega-3 fatty acids every day. Breastfeeding women should get slightly more, about 1.3 grams. The following foods each provide about 1 gram of omega-3 fatty acid:1 tablespoon walnut oil = 1.4 grams1 ounce black walnuts = 0.6 gram1 tablespoon canola oil = 1.3 grams1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds = 1.6 grams1 1/2 ounces herring = 1 gram2 1/2 ounces of Atlantic salmon = 1 gram4 ounces of canned white tuna = 1 gramOmega-3-fortified eggs are also an option. Two eggs provide about half the daily amount recommended above, depending on the brand.Consider taking a supplement if you don't like the taste of fish or if you're eating fish less often because ofmercury concerns. (Nursing moms should eat 8 to 12 ounces of cooked fish or canned ""light"" tuna and up to 6 ounces of canned albacore tuna a week, according to joint guidelines from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency.)Omega-3 supplements made from fish oils are considered safe for nursing moms. According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, they don't have detectable levels of mercury or toxins. But skip cod liver oil supplements if you're breastfeeding because they can contain excessive amounts of vitamins A and D.If you're taking a supplement, read the label to determine how much omega-3 fatty acid each capsule contains, and ask your doctor to recommend a dosage for you. Starting with a low dose and gradually increasing it or taking the pills with meals lessens the chance of having side effects like diarrhea, bloating, and nausea. Don't skimp on proteinIt's especially important to get enough protein in your diet now, says Shoshana Bennett, a psychologist on the advisory council of Postpartum Support International (PSI), an advocacy and support group for women with PPD.Bennett says that eating small amounts of protein throughout the day helps keep blood sugar levels even and moods stable. And consuming dairy products, poultry, meat, and fish  along with low-glycemic carbs like nuts, whole grains, and beans  can boost production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter which has a calming effect on the brain.To get more protein in your diet, try having scrambled eggs for breakfast, a turkey or roast beef sandwich for lunch, and yogurt or cheese and crackers for a snack.The total amount of protein you need daily depends on how much you weigh and whether you're nursing. The average range is 50 to 85 grams of protein a day for nursing moms, and 30 to 55 grams for moms who aren't nursing.If you're very petite or on the heavier side, your protein requirement might fall outside these ranges. Check the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food planning tool, MyPlate to find out how much protein you need.These are some good sources of protein:3 ounces chicken, turkey, or meat = 20 to 25 grams protein3 ounces fish = about 20 grams proteinTwo 8-ounce glasses milk = 16 grams proteinTwo 8-ounce glasses soy milk = 14 grams proteinTwo large eggs = 12 grams protein2 ounces Swiss cheese = 16 grams protein1/2 block firm tofu = 14 grams protein1 cup cottage cheese = 22 to 31 grams protein1 cup plain low-fat yogurt = 12 grams protein2 ounces dry-roasted peanuts = 14 grams protein1 cup cooked beans, such as chickpeas (garbanzo beans), kidney beans, baked beans, pinto beans, refried beans, or black beans = 12 to 19 grams protein1 cup cooked lentils = 18 grams proteinDrink plenty of liquidDehydration may make the blues worse. Fatigue and anxiety are actually symptoms of moderate dehydration. So drink at least nine 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day (about 13 glasses if you're breastfeeding). Choose water or noncaffeinated beverages that aren't sweetened with sugar.Also, don't wait to drink until you feel thirsty. (By the time you notice your thirst, mild dehydration may have already kicked in.) This is especially important if you're breastfeeding because nursing can make you extra thirsty. Grab a tall glass of water, juice, or even decaf iced tea every time you sit down to nurse your baby. Limit your alcohol intakeThough it may give you a quick buzz, alcohol is a depressant, so limit your drinking until you're on a more even keel. An occasional glass of wine in the evening to unwind isn't a problem, but regular heavy drinking may make your mood worse and disrupt your sleep. Depression and alcoholism often go hand in hand, so if you feel like your drinking is spiraling out of control, talk to your healthcare provider.There are other reasons to abstain from drinking during the postpartum period. Having more than an infrequent drink can affect yourability to nurseand take care of your child.Moderate your caffeine intakeA cup or two of coffee can get you going in the morning, but if you're guzzling caffeinated beverages all day long, you're more likely to end up jittery, frazzled, and unable to sleep at night. ""Caffeine is public enemy number one  it is horrible for anxiety,"" says Bennett. ""It makes people agitated, irritable, and restless,"" she says, noting that those are also symptoms of mood disorders.Plus, if you're breastfeeding, doctors recommend having no more than300 mg of caffeine a day (about what you'd get in two 8-ounce cups of coffee) to avoid affecting your baby.Abruptly giving up all caffeine can cause temporary headaches, lethargy, and crankiness. So if you drink a lot of the stuff, don't just quit cold turkey. Slowly cut back to a few caffeinated beverages a day  or none if you want to be caffeine-free.Go for dark chocolate when you're craving sweetsIt's easy to reach for junk food when you're tired and need some quick calories, but try to resist the urge. Junk food may give you a temporary lift, but that surge comes with an eventual crash. If you do indulge occasionally, don't beat yourself up about it. ""If you have to eat something with a lot of sugar, eat some chocolate,"" says registered dietitian Jo Ann Hattner.High-quality dark chocolate  at least 70 percent cocoa  can improve mood by increasing the serotonin level in your brain. And some studies indicate that chocolate consumption triggers the release of endorphins, brain chemicals responsible for euphoric feelings.Don't forget your vitaminsAlthough a supplement is no substitute for a healthy diet rich infruits and veggies, it can be difficult to cover all your nutritional bases during those first few busy weeks with a new baby. So keep taking yourprenatal vitaminfor a couple months postpartum.Prenatal vitamins generally contain more iron than regular multivitamins, which is important because your iron stores may be depleted after pregnancy and giving birth (especially if you had a cesarean section). Low iron levels can leave you feeling fatigued and down. Also, antioxidants  including vitamins A, C, and E  may improve overall brain function, according to Bennett.Pay attention to your appetiteIt's normal to skip meals and forget to eat on a regular schedule during the harried first weeks of caring for a newborn. But if you find that you're rarely hungry and eating is a chore, your loss of appetite may be a symptom of postpartum depression.Eating poorly can also contribute to mood problems. Your body needs regular, balanced meals and snacks to keep blood sugar levels stable. When they're not, it can affect your mood. If you consistently have to force yourself to eat, talk to your care provider.More informationThe USDA's MyPlate tool offers a customized daily food plan based on your age, gender, and activity level.Get recipes forquick, nutritious snacks for time-starved moms.See ourdiet for a healthy breastfeeding momanddiet for healthy postpartum weight loss.Visit ourMom's Nutrition: Postpartumindex page.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

Talk to nursing moms, read articles to familiarize yourself, and consider calling your local La Leche League International chapter or taking a breastfeeding class. The more you know about how to get started and the benefits of nursing, the better.Choose a doctor for your babyGet names of pediatricians or family practitioners from friends, co-workers, neighbors, or your prenatal caregiver.

See all pregnancy videosAssemble your baby gearThis is the perfect job for your partner or a friend who wants to help. Cribs, bassinets, and strollers can be tricky to put together, especially when you're sleep-deprived, so get started now. Swings, mobiles, and monitors usually require batteries, so make sure you have enough on hand. To save money  and help the planet  consider getting rechargeable batteries and a battery charger.Set up a safe place for your baby to sleepWhether you plan to have your baby slumber in a crib or bassinet, it's important to follow basic guidelines to reduce your baby's risk of SIDS.Find out all about making sure your baby's sleeping space is safe.Talk to your babyYour baby can hear your voice now, and talking to him or her is a great way to start the bonding process. If having an actual conversation with your bump seems odd, try narrating your daily activities; reading a book, magazine, or newspaper aloud; or sharing your secret wishes for your child.This is great practice for after your baby's born, too. Talking to babies is one of the best ways to help them develop language skills.Learn about coping with labor painThere's no one right way to deliver a baby: Every woman's experience with pain is different and every labor is different. But whether you know you want pain medication during childbirth or a natural birth, it's good to learn about your options now.Know the stages of laborFor first-time moms, labor takes an average of 15 hours, though it's not uncommon to last more than 20. (For women who've previously had a vaginal birth, it averages eight hours.) The process is divided into three main stages  learn about them so you'll feel prepared for labor and birth.Create a birth planChildbirth is unpredictable, and chances are you won't follow your birth plan to the letter. Still, it's helpful to figure out your preferences beforehand for pain management techniques, who'll be present during delivery, whether your baby will ""room in"" with you after birth, and more.Fill out our handy Birth Plan Worksheet and discuss it with your provider.Wash your baby's clothing and beddingYou know all those adorable, pristine outfits and blankies you bought or received as gifts? It's time to throw them in the laundry. You should wash anything that will go near your baby's skin to remove any irritants in the fabrics. The gentlest detergents are those designed for babies and those that are labeled hypoallergenic or good for sensitive skin.Start lining up helpersYour friends and family will want to pitch in after your baby's born, but many new moms are too overwhelmed to direct household help. Here's how to prepare now: Make a list of people who have offered to help. Then set up a schedule so each person has a specific task and date to do it.Tasks could include bringing your family a meal, picking up groceries (create a master list of foods your family likes), taking care of your older children, doing the dishes, cleaning up, taking out the garbage, walking your dog, or feeding your pets.Commemorate your bellyCelebrate your amazing pregnant belly by decorating it with beautiful designs (you can use regular face paint), getting a henna ""tattoo"" applied (go to an artist who uses the pure, natural kind), or making a belly cast. You may also want to splurge on professional pictures of your pregnant self.Consider top baby costs and how to saveRaising a baby isn't cheap. (You can check our Baby Costs Calculator to see how it all adds up.) But there are plenty of ways you can think about saving money now.See the top baby expenses moms reported to us, and what you can do about them.Read up on baby careIf you haven't already, the third trimester is the perfect time to switch reading gears from pregnancy to baby. You won't have as much time to read after your baby's born, so learn all you can about the first few weeks now. A good place to start is BabyCenter's newborn area.Pack your bag for the hospital or birth centerKey things to bring include your insurance card, toiletries, comfy clothing, a going-home outfit for your baby, phone (plus charger!), and snacks for after labor. You may also want to bring a box of chocolates or other treat for the nurses (not required, but appreciated!).See our full list of what to pack for the hospital or birth center.Have your house cleanedIn a BabyCenter survey, a third of moms said they wished they had had their house cleaned before their baby's arrival. Consider hiring a housecleaner or asking a friend or family member to tackle this task, maybe while you're at the hospital or birth center. It feels great to come back to a tidy home, and you won't have time or energy to clean while your baby's a newborn.Stock up on household and personal suppliesTo avoid having to make trips to the store with your newborn, stock up now on pantry staples, frozen food, medicine, toilet paper, sanitary pads for postpartum bleeding, shampoo  even extra pairs of underwear! And of course, make sure you have newborn necessities like diapers, wipes, baby clothing, and bottles and formula if you plan to use these.Make food for after your baby's bornWhen you cook, start doubling recipes and freezing half. You and your partner will be too exhausted to cook in the first weeks after you bring your baby home and you'll be thrilled to have healthy meals you can heat up fast. For ideas, check out these recipes good for freezing and reheating.Install your baby's car seatYou can't drive your baby home without a car seat, and they can be more complicated to install than you'd think. So don't wait until the last minute. If you're having trouble, some car seat manufacturers have a toll-free number for you to call so an expert can walk you through the process. Or get a car seat safety inspector to help you. To find one in your area, go to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration's website or look in your local phone book.Tour your hospital or birth centerThe more familiar you are with your surroundings, the less intimidating labor and birth will be. On your tour of your hospital or birth center, you'll probably visit labor and recovery rooms and the nursery, as well as get an overview of basic policies.Ask if you can preregister in the weeks before your delivery to get this red tape out of the way. You don't want to have to sign a bunch of releases and permissions forms when you're in labor, or have your partner whisked away to do so.Make a plan for when labor startsLong before the first contractions hit, you'll want a firm plan in place. Your doctor or midwife should give you a clear set of guidelines for when to call and  unless you're having a home birth  when to head to the hospital or birth center.Decide who will take you there, and have a few back-up folks lined up to help if you need it. Practice the route you'll take  this may sound silly, but it will be one less thing to think about. This includes learning where to park and which entrance to use when it's time to check yourself in.Learn the signs that your labor may start soon.Make a baby watch listFigure out who you'll want to tell right after your baby arrives (or when you go into labor) and how you'll spread the word. Some new or soon-to-be moms post updates on their social media accounts, while others prefer to call, text, or email the big news. If you'd rather your partner or a friend handle this for you, make a list of phone numbers or email addresses of people you want told right away and pass it on.Look out for late-pregnancy complicationsUnfortunately, pregnancy complications pop up in the third trimester, too  including premature labor and preeclampsia. Be on the lookout for symptoms that warrant a call to your doctor or midwife.Find baby name inspirationIf you don't have a few great baby names on deck, check out our Baby Names Finder to see name popularity, origin, and meanings.Get creative about third-trimester sexIf you're having a healthy, uncomplicated pregnancy, you can probably continue to have sex right up until your water breaks or you go into labor. You may have to get creative about positions as your belly expands, however!Find out more about having sex in the third trimester.Cope with late-pregnancy jittersBy late pregnancy, there are a lot of unknowns that may be making you nervous  like when your labor will start, how it will go, whether your baby will be okay, and how you'll adjust to being a mom. These fears are normal  but nerve-wracking. Here are a few ways to quiet them:Use the relaxation techniques you learned in childbirth classes. They may help calm your nerves now, plus it's good practice for the big day.Visualize your baby and imagine yourself snuggling with him or her.Check in with other moms-to-be in your Birth Club who are also playing the waiting game.Don't be shy about contacting your midwife or doctor if you have any new or lingering concerns.Slow downToward the end of your pregnancy, slow down and save up your energy for labor day (and beyond). If you've been sitting or lying down for a long time, don't jump up too quickly. Blood can pool in your feet and legs, causing a temporary drop in your blood pressure when you get up that can make you feel dizzy.Learn what your body will be like after birthMany first-time moms don't realize that after giving birth, it's normal to still look pregnant for a while. This may be hard to accept, but try to remember that it took nine months to get here, so you won't bounce back overnight. Learn what to expect from your body.Stock up on light entertainmentPick up some magazines or funny novels, fill up your DVR with your favorite programs, and create a list of online shows that you'd like to watch. Once your baby arrives, you'll be glad to have easy, quick ways to get an entertainment fix when you have the chance.Don't panic if you go past your due dateAfter months of anticipation, your due date rolls around, and ... you're still pregnant. It's a frustrating, but common, situation. (In a BabyCenter poll, 33 percent of moms said they delivered late.) If you go one or two weeks past your due date, your provider may use medication or other techniques to start your labor.To-do's for every trimesterDrink waterDuring pregnancy you need about 10 8-ounce glasses of fluid per day (80 fluid ounces) plus an additional 8 ounces for each hour of light activity. Every woman is different, so don't worry if you end up needing a little more or less. Keep an eye on the color of your urine  if it's dark yellow or cloudy, you need to drink more. Clear or pale yellow urine means you're well-hydrated.Find out why staying hydrated is so important.Do some stretchingStretching enhances your flexibility, prevents your muscles from tightening, and makes you feel looser and more relaxed.Check out these soothing pregnancy stretches.Sneak in a pregnancy power napWhen fatigue makes it hard to get through the day, revive yourself with a 15-minute snooze. If you're at work, find a place you can escape (close your office door, use a conference room, even sit in your car) and set the alarm on your cell phone.Pack healthy snacksWhen hunger attacks, it helps to have snacks that pack a nutritional punch ready in your desk, purse, or car. And if you're suffering from morning sickness, munching on a simple snack like crackers throughout the day or before you get out of bed can ease nausea.Get ideas for healthy pregnancy snacks.Try a relaxation techniqueDeep breathing, guided imagery, prenatal yoga, and progressive muscle relaxation can help you stay on an even keel  and sleep better.Learn how to do these relaxation techniques.Take a quick walkA 15- to 20-minute walk can help boost your energy levels when you're exhausted.Find out why walking is such a great pregnancy exercise.Eat a pregnancy superfoodTo give your pregnancy a nutritional boost, nosh on colorful fruits and veggies, eggs, salmon, sweet potatoes, yogurt, walnuts, beans, and more.See the other pregnancy superfoods.Write down your pregnancy memoriesWhether you keep a formal journal or just jot down a few notes when the spirit moves you, you'll love sharing these pregnancy stories with your child someday.Get tips on writing a pregnancy diary.Track your weight gainYour provider will monitor your pregnancy weight to make sure you're in a healthy range and gaining at an appropriate pace.

Nanny interview questions,https://www.babycenter.com/0_nanny-interview-questions_1450905.bc,"Use these questions to guide your search for the right nanny for your child.Experience and trainingLook for anannywho has taken care of children before  you don't want your kids to be her guinea pigs. She doesn't necessarily have to have many years of experience, but she should know what she's doing. Ask if she has a resume (although don't be surprised if she doesn't have one).How long have you been a nanny?How old were the other children you cared for?Do you have any formal early childhood development or childcare training?Would you be willing to take classes to further your education in childcare?Do you have emergency training? In CPR? In first-aid?If not, would you be willing to take CPR classes and first-aid training?What would you do if my child was sick or had an accident?Would you mind if I ran a background check on you?Philosophy and approachMake sure a nanny's philosophy about childrearing is in line with yours. Ask each candidate why she's a nanny and what she likes about the job  you need to know that she's in the field for all the right reasons, and that she enjoys children.On being a nanny:Why are you a nanny?Why are you looking for a new position?What do you like about the job?Describe your ideal family/employer:What do you like least about being a nanny?Do you have any special peeves about parents/children/pets?On dealing with children:What are your beliefs about childrearing?What do children like best about you?How do you comfort children? How do you deal with separation anxiety?How do you discipline children? Give me an example of a previous discipline problem and how you handled it.What are some of the rules you've followed in other households that you think worked well?Which rules haven't worked for you?Would you be willing to follow my rules and disciplining/comforting strategies even if they're different from yours?Daily routines:What will my child be doing on any given day? (See ourdaily log sheet.)What are your favorite activities to do with a child the age of mine?If I'm working in the house, will you be able to keep my child happily occupied without involving me?Logistics and salaryFind out whether the nanny you're considering will work out when it comes to practical matters.Do you have future plans (school, job, marriage, etc.) that would put a limit on how long you expect to be a nanny?Do you have a well-functioning car, with appropriate safety belts and room for car seats?Have you had any accidents, and is your car insurance current?Do you want a live-in arrangement?If it's not a live-in arrangement, where do you live and how would you get to work?If it's not a live-in arrangement, would you bring your own food or expect meals to be provided?Do you smoke?Are you willing to do light chores while our baby is sleeping? Which ones?Do you have any personal responsibilities or health issues that could interfere with a regular work schedule?When would you be able to start working?Would you ever be available to work evenings or weekends?Would you be available to travel with our family for weekends/vacations?When do you expect to take a vacation of your own?Salary:What nannies charge varies widely depending on where you live and how many hours she works. The best way to get an idea of the going rate in your area is to ask other moms, then ask each candidate for her salary range.References:Ask each candidate for a list of past and present references, and call them. Ask specific questions: Instead of asking whether they liked the nanny, ask what exactly they did and didn't like about her. Ask for a minimum of two references, although the more the better.Interaction and observationGive each candidate a chance to spend some time with your child in your home. Does she seem attentive? How does your child interact with her? Your observations matter a great deal when you finally make your choice. It may help to take a moment to ask yourself the following questions.Does she seem comfortable holding or speaking to your child?Was she pleasant?How did your child respond to her? Did he seem happy?Are the two of you able to communicate easily and effectively with each other?While you're away from your child, will you feel at ease knowing your child is with her?"
Medication for iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_medication-for-iron-deficiency-anemia-during-pregnancy_10414723.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWhat medication is used to treat iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy?If you have iron-deficiency anemia, it means your body has a low level of iron, which is necessary to build healthy red blood cells. The most effective treatment for anemia during pregnancy is to take an iron supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamin.It may take a little trial and error to determine the correct dose. Work with your healthcare provider to balance effectiveness with any unpleasant side effects. You may have to take your prenatal vitamin and iron supplement at different times.Are iron supplements safe to take in pregnancy?Yes, iron supplements are safe to take during pregnancy. And if you take the supplements as prescribed, you should see an improvement in your iron-deficiency anemia.Take your regular prenatal vitamin  you still need this for other vital minerals. And make iron part of your pregnancy diet, too.Note: Iron supplements for adults can be dangerous for children. Children can get very sick, or even die, from accidentally taking iron pills. Keep your iron pills safely out of the reach of children.What are the side effects of iron supplements?The first thing you may notice when you start taking iron is that your stools turn a dark color, almost black, because your body doesn't completely absorb the mineral. Although it looks different, there's no need to worry. This is just a normal reaction to the extra iron in your body.Gastrointestinal side effects are most common. You may feel bloated or nauseated, or have an upset stomach.Being constipated and unable to have a bowel movement is another common side effect of pregnancy, and iron supplements can make constipation worse. If you're suffering from constipation, drink plenty of fluids, eat at least 25 grams of fiber a day, and use the bathroom whenever you feel the urge to have a bowel movement.Work with your provider to come up with an exercise plan, and try drinking prune juice to get things moving. Your provider might also prescribe a stool softener.How do I deal with the side effects of iron, and take it so it's most effective?How and when you take iron makes a big difference. For example, if you feel nauseated after taking your supplement, try taking it with a small snack or some juice. Don't take iron with a meal  too much food prevents iron absorption.Iron is best absorbed with acid. Take supplements with orange juice, so your body can get the maximum benefits.Medication can also affect how your body absorbs iron. For example, heartburn is another common ailment during pregnancy, and antacids can affect the absorption of iron. If you need to take antacids, it's best to take your iron supplement at least two hours before or two hours after the antacid.Iron can also prevent the absorption of certain drugs, like levothyroxine, which is taken for thyroid problems. If you take iron and levothyroxine, take the pills four hours apart. Check whether you need to adjust the timing of your other medications.Some foods and drinks can even prevent your body from absorbing iron properly. These include:Coffee and teaEggsDairy productsBran, soy, nuts and seeds, and other foods high in phytates (the storage form of phosphorus)For the best results, try to take supplements one hour before or two hours after consuming these foods and drinks. The same may apply to calcium supplements.This seems like a lot to remember, but it becomes second nature once you get into a routine. And don't give up if you're experiencing unpleasant side effects from iron supplements. Your provider may recommend a different type of supplement or suggest splitting the dose into smaller quantities to take at intervals throughout the day.Are there any alternatives to iron supplements?Talk to your provider about your options. If you can't tolerate taking an iron pill, ask for a liquid supplement. (You may want to use a straw to take liquid iron supplements so you don't stain your teeth.)If you have severe iron-deficiency anemia that doesn't respond well to iron supplements, you may need to get iron intravenously. Your provider can do this or she can refer you to a hematologist or a maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

I switched from lisinopril (not safe) to labetalol (considered safe). Even though I'm not pregnant yet, knowing that the blood pressure meds I'm taking are unlikely to harm a future baby puts my mind at ease.""

Shamandreaming""I paid close attention to my blood pressure, diet, physical activity, and stress level throughout my pregnancy.

Grace917Food for thought""Google 'foods high in potassium.' There are lots of foods that have more potassium than bananas."" Ariel815""I have at least 100 grams of protein daily, which means eating four to five small meals a day with healthy protein in each of them. So far, I've had no ankle swelling and no protein in my urine."" MandyKatie""I always thought I ate a lot of protein until I started tracking it. I was getting about 45 grams, but 80 was my goal.

Preparing your child to attend a sibling's birth,https://www.babycenter.com/0_preparing-your-child-to-attend-a-siblings-birth_176.bc,"Is it okay to have my child attend the birth?This is a very personal decision. Some parents want to give their children the chance to witness the miracle of birth. Others are uncomfortable with the idea, and nervous as to how their child may react.The experts are also divided. Some say children under age 5 are too young to attend; others disagree. ""There is no magical age,"" says Ann Linden, a midwife in New York City. ""In fact, certain children may be comfortable with the idea at age 7, for example, and aghast at the thought at age 12, and interested again at age 15."" Ultimately, the choice for a child to be present at a birth is highly individual. If you want to explore the possibility with your child, present the idea without exerting any pressure. And let him know that he's allowed to change his mind at any time.If you want to have the option of letting your child attend the birth, research which hospitals or birthing centers have progressive sibling policies. If the facility you've chosen is resistant to the idea, try talking to the administrators there and your healthcare provider to see if you can work out a plan that suits everyone. As a last resort, let them know that you're so committed to this idea that you're willing to take your business elsewhere if they can't accommodate you.How can I prepare my older child for witnessing his sibling's birth?A child of any age will need some preparation for this experience. No matter how wonderful it can be to watch a baby being born, it can also be very frightening for a child to see his mother in pain.These suggestions may help:Discuss the mechanics of labor with your child. Read books and watch videos on childbirth together. Explain to your child that there will be blood, and that you'll be making unfamiliar, possibly alarming, sounds.Assign one adult to care exclusively for your child during the birth. Choose someone with whom your child has a positive relationship and feels comfortable talking. That person can take him out of the room when he's uncomfortable, bring him meals, and watch how he's doing. This adult will need to pay close attention to your child's cues. If your child is uncomfortable and shows signs of wanting to leave, this support person must follow his or her lead.If the hospital or birthing center has a ""family room"" separate from the birthing room, encourage your child and his support person to use it to play, watch TV, or read. This will give your child the option of coming and going when he wants. Make it clear that it's okay to go into the delivery room after the baby is born.If you have a younger child, consider inviting him into the delivery room only for the actual moment of birth. Asking a young child to endure his mom's entire labor could be very hard on him.Feel free to change your own mind about having your child at the birth. You may decide that you feel uncomfortable having him present, that it makes you feel self-conscious or unfocused.After delivery, when you've recovered sufficiently, discuss the birth with your child. Ask for his impressions of the experience, and try to address any lingering fears or concerns he may have.Keep in mind that childbirth is an incredibly powerful experience and that no matter how well you prepare your child, or how old or mature he is, it could still be traumatic for him. One young woman, who at age 21 attended the birth of her brother, says: ""It's a raw moment between parent and child. I don't know if most children are prepared to see their mothers in such a vulnerable position. During the delivery I felt weak in the knees, embarrassed to see my mother in such a primal state. Yet when my brother was born, it was like witnessing a miracle."""
Doctor visit: The seven-year checkup,https://www.babycenter.com/doctor-visit-worksheet-seven-year-checkup,"You can expect your child's doctor to:Weigh and measure your child to make sure she's growing at a healthy rate and isn't overweight or underweight.Check her blood pressure.Check her heart and breathing.Check her immunization record and give her any shots that she's missing.Check her hearing.Do an eye exam to check the structure and alignment of your child's eyes and her ability to move them correctly. The doctor will also look for signs of congenital eye conditions or other problems, and check her eyesight with an eye chart.Do a tuberculosis test if your child has any risk factors.Check for scoliosis by having your child stand up and then bend over to touch her toes, so the doctor can get a good look at her spine.Questions the doctor may ask:What is he eating? At 7, your child is able to make his own snacks (or at least find the box of cookies you hid in the cabinet). This makes it harder to regulate his meals but not impossible.Is he sleeping ten hours a night? Does he look rested when he wakes? Although he may want to stay up all night, a bedtime between eight and nine o'clock is a good idea.How does he get to school? Now that he's old enough to walk or ride his bike to school alone, it's important to make sure he's getting there safely.Does he enjoy school? A child who is restless at school may need to be given a little more  or less  of a challenge. How is he handling homework and school pressures?Does he know his address and phone number? By 7, he should have this information memorized.Do you have a fire escape safety plan? By this age, your child can follow a fire safety plan. Practice getting out of your house safely in the event of fire. See our checklist.What's next?Find out what's in store for you at the 8-year doctor visit."
Overweight and pregnant: How to manage weight gain during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_overweight-and-pregnant-how-to-manage-weight-gain-during-pre_1313887.bc,"If you started off your pregnancy carrying too much weight for your height, you're far from alone. More than half of pregnant women are overweight or obese.You're considered overweight if your pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI) is between 25 and 29.9. (Your BMI reflects the relationship between your height and weight, and is an estimate of body fat.) You're considered obese if your BMI is 30 or greater.Not sure what your BMI is? Try thisBMI calculator.How much weight to gain if you're pregnant and overweight or obeseHow much to gain during pregnancy depends on your BMI:If your BMI is 25 to 29.9:It's recommended that you gain between 15 and 25 pounds by the end of your pregnancy, or approximately 2 to 3 pounds per month in your second and third trimesters.If your BMI is 30 or higher:You're advised to gain only 11 to 20 pounds during pregnancy.A study published in 2010 in the journalObstetrics & Gynecologyfound that pregnant women who gained more than the recommended weight were 50 percent more likely to developgestational diabetesthan moms-to-be whose weight stayed within recommended limits.For guidance, try ourpregnancy weight gain calculator and learn more aboutpregnancy weight gain.Can I diet to lose weight during pregnancy?Pregnancy is definitelynotthe time to go on a weight-loss diet: Restricting your food intake is potentially hazardous to you and your developing baby. But many plus-size women do lose weight during pregnancy without dieting.In the first trimester, it's common to lose weight as the result ofmorning sickness: The nausea can diminish your appetite, and the vomiting can cause you to miss out on calories. But even so, your baby will get all the necessary calories.Overweight women have an extra reserve of calories in stored fat, so as your baby grows, it's not harmful to maintain or even lose a little weight at first. What's not okay is losing weight because you're intentionally cutting calories (and, as a result, limiting nutrients).How to stay on track with weight gain if you're overweight or obeseExercising and eating healthy food can help you with your weight gain goals, and both can have a positive impact on your pregnancy, reducing your risk of pregnancy problems likegestational diabetesandpreeclampsia. They'll also help you feel good during your pregnancy and beyond.Eat a healthy pregnancy dietResearch, planning, and tracking helps youeat well during pregnancyand follow theseven principles of pregnancy nutrition.Use our handypregnancy food diaryto make sure you're getting enough nutrients and drinking plenty of water every day. The diary is also useful for tracking your mood and hunger levels, so you can spot patterns you may need to change.If you need help planning your pregnancy meals, seek out a registered dietitian. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all women receive counseling to help them achieve optimum health  including a healthy weight and diet  before becoming pregnant.Exercise regularlyIf you're a relative newcomer to exercise, start withpregnancy exercise for beginners. You can enjoy low-impact exercise such aswalking,swimming, and low-impact aerobics. Never start an exercise regime without first talking to your healthcare provider.

Celebrating your toddler's second birthday,https://www.babycenter.com/0_celebrating-your-toddlers-second-birthday_1490897.bc,"Your toddler's second birthday is coming up and you want to celebrate. But how? Read on for advice and party tips for 2-year-olds.What can I expect at a toddler's birthday?At 2, kids are mostly concerned with their own needs and wants. That's just how the world looks to 2-year-olds (and it doesn't mean they're spoiled). Things are likely to go more smoothly at a party with good adult supervision, not too many guests, and reasonable expectations.At the age of 2, your child may be clingy one minute and freedom-seeking the next. While he happily plays alongside other children, your child won't yet understand the give and take that's a necessary part of interacting peacefully with other kids.This means the party isn't really about inviting other kids for your child's enjoyment  that matters more as he gets older. It's more about celebrating with people who are important to your family.Because your toddler can't yet put himself in another child's shoes, he may hit, bite, or snatch toys from his guests. If you think this may be an issue, arm yourself with strategies for heading off aggression and encouraging sharing.As he gets a little older, your toddler better understands how others think and feel and can behave accordingly.Who do I invite to a toddler's birthday?You probably have close family on your list and you may want to invite one or more other toddlers and their parents. An oft-quoted rule of thumb is to invite two children for your child's second birthday, three for his third birthday, and so on. A good approach to determining the length of the guest list is to think about how your toddler has reacted to large and small gatherings in the past, and choose the size party you think he'll be comfortable with.What's the best time to have a toddler's birthday?Most children this age still take an afternoon nap, so take that into account when scheduling the party. You probably want to pick a morning or late afternoon, and keep it short and sweet  an hour or two is ample time for toddlers and parents alike.Where's the best place to have a toddler's birthday?Home is generally the easiest place to throw your child's party, but if you have a lot of guests or your home isn't the ideal place for hosting, you might want to try arranging an event at an indoor play area, a park, a local recreation center, a gymnastics school, a kids' museum, a church hall, or a restaurant. Some places do most of the party organizing for you, for a fee. Is it a good idea to have a theme for a toddler's birthday?It's not a necessary ingredient, but many 2-year-olds are thrilled by a party theme based on a favorite character, toy, or animal. Imagine a Curious George theme, for example, with bananas as a snack, stuffed monkeys or Curious George books for decoration, paper plates with George's face on them, and a cake shaped like a big yellow hat. Or a bug party, with butterfly-shaped invitations, a caterpillar cake, bug stickers for the guests, and a simple game in which toddlers dig for prizes in a bucket.What about food at a toddler's birthday?If your party doesn't happen at mealtime, you don't have to worry much about food  a small snack and some drinks are plenty. If you're feeding your guests lunch or dinner, small portions work best, like sandwiches shaped with cookie cutters, English muffin pizzas, bite-size pieces of fruit or cooked veggies, small crackers, and cupcakes. (If you're mainly feeding adults, it's easiest to plan a simple meal for them that can be fed in small pieces to the children, too.)Keep in mind that choking is still a risk at this age, especially if your little one is gulping his food in a hurry so he can get back to playing. Avoid foods like nuts, whole grapes or cherries with pits, marshmallows, hot dogs, and round, hard candies or gum.You need enough highchairs or child-sized tables and chairs to accommodate all the kids. If that's too much trouble, consider having a ""picnic"" on the floor.Food is bound to be spilled, so put a blanket or tablecloth down first. Spill-proof cups are a great idea, too.What are the best activities to have at a toddler's birthday?Most toddlers love dressing up, so you might want to have a box of clothes or costumes handy. Simple games or activities that kids can follow your lead on, like Ring Around the Rosey or dancing to music are good ideas, too. Toward the end of the party, you can read the kids a story in an effort to calm them down a bit before they head home.It's smart to have a few activities planned, but don't worry if the kids end up brushing them off in favor of playing with various toys or bouncing from one thing at the party to another.What about goody bags at a toddler's birthday?By the age of 2, guests appreciate a little goody bag. There's no need to spend much  low-cost favors like crayons, plastic animals or figurines, matchbox cars, plastic bracelets, bubbles, or stickers will provide plenty of excitement and amusement.What's the best birthday gift to give a toddler?What should you give a just-turned-2-year-old? Here are a few possibilities. (For more ideas, see our gift list.)Push or pull toys, like a wagon, a doll stroller, or a mini shopping cartRole-play toys, like plastic foods and kitchen utensils, or a tea setThinking toys, like puzzles or booksArt supplies, like watercolors and construction paperOutdoor gear, like a ball or a kiddie poolIf your toddler opens his gifts in front of other children, be prepared to defuse flare-ups over sharing. If you decide to wait on presents until after the guests are gone, send a thank you note to the gift-giver. Including a photo of your child opening or playing with the gift is a nice touch.Find out what happened in history on your child's special day."
Pregnant with multiples: Nutrition and fitness needs,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pregnant-with-multiples-nutrition-and-fitness-needs_3580.bc,"Do I need to eat more if I'm pregnant with multiples?Yes. If you're pregnant with multiples, you need more calories than a woman who's carrying just one baby.A general guideline is to add 300 calories a day for each baby. So if you're carrying twins, you'd add roughly 600 calories to your usual diet. This amount may be different if you were overweight or underweight before you got pregnant, so talk with your provider to come up with an eating plan that has the number of calories that's appropriate for you.Whether you're carrying twins, triplets, or more, plan to eatat least five times a day(three meals and two substantial snacks), even if you don't feel especially hungry.Of course,not all calories are created equal. Make each one count by limiting sugar and eating a variety of foodspacked with the nutrients you need, including protein, carbohydrates, andfats. Cheese, milk, meat, eggs, nuts, and healthy oils all fuel your babies' growth. Round out your diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.How much weight should I gain if I'm pregnant with multiples?Gaining the right amount of weight is necessary to nourish your growing babies. Try to put on pounds starting early in the pregnancy  when your babies are developing rapidly and you still have room to fill your stomach. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends the following weight gain ranges for women carrying twins based on their pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI):37 to 54 pounds if you started at a normal weight (BMI of 18.5 to 24.9)31 to 50 pounds if you were overweight (BMI of 25 to 29.9)25 to 42 pounds if you were obese (BMI of 30 or higher)According to the IOM, there isn't enough data to make weight gain recommendations for women pregnant with triplets or more. If you're expecting three or more babies, ask your provider for a weight gain target that's right for you.If you were underweight before pregnancy, you'll have to put on extra weight quickly to catch up. Your provider can help you set healthy weight goals throughout your pregnancy. Live birth: TwinsFollow one woman through her pregnancy with twins and watch her give birth.Will I need to take a special kind of prenatal vitamin?Prenatal vitamins are important, but you don't need a special formula for twins and triplets. A standardprenatal supplementwill do just fine.A supplement is the best way to ensure that you get vital nutrients such as folic acid,iron, andcalcium. Your provider can recommend specific brands and doses.Women carrying more than one baby are at a higher risk foriron-deficiency anemiaduring pregnancy. Your provider will monitor your iron level to make sure you're getting enough. If you're not, she may recommend that you take an iron supplement.High doses of iron can sometimes lead to constipation andnausea, so talk to your provider about ways to avoid these problems.How much water do I need if I'm pregnant with multiples?Even if you're the type of person who never goes anywhere without a water bottle, pay extra attention to how much water you're drinking now that you're carrying multiples. Women who are pregnant with one baby are advised to drink 10 8-ounce cups of water (or other hydrating beverages) each day, so that's probably a good starting point for you too.But every woman is different  you may need a little more or less water than someone else. Ask your provider for specific advice on fluid intake.Of course, drinking extra fluids means you'll be making extra trips to the bathroom (especially as your babies grow larger), but you can use this as a chance to check if you're hydrated. Aim to drink enough water to keep your urine clear or pale yellow. If it's cloudy or dark yellow, drink more.It's especially important to prevent dehydration in the second half of pregnancy because having multiples can raise the risk ofpremature labor and early delivery.Can I exercise if I'm pregnant with multiples?If you're a healthy, active woman with multiples on the way, you can probably continue to exercise during your pregnancy, as long as your provider gives you the go-ahead.Keep it slow, relaxed, and gentle. Your body  and your babies  may not be able to handle intense workouts. Good options includeswimming,walking, andprenatal yoga.Be sure you're hydrated before, during, and after your workout. And no matter what exercise you enjoy, stop immediately if you develop signs of overheating, such as nausea, dizziness, or a racing heart.That said, carrying more than one baby is a workout in itself, and some women may need to commit to extra rest or avoid doing certain types of exercise. For example, aerobic exercise may be off-limits if you're at risk of delivering your baby early.Discuss your workout routine with your provider to make sure you and your baby stay healthy during your pregnancy, and be sure to tell your provider if you develop signs of preterm labor, such as abdominal pain or bleeding. Preterm labor is a reason for you to stop exercising altogether.Learn more:Pregnant with multiples: Prenatal careTwins fetal development month by monthNational Organization of Mothers of Twins ClubsShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

5 things to do if you're feeling blue after delivery,https://www.babycenter.com/0_5-things-to-do-if-youre-feeling-blue-after-delivery_10405837.bc,"Up to 80 percent of moms feel weepy and emotional in the weeks after giving birth, known as the baby blues. Although the exact cause is still unknown, it may occur partly because the hormones that sustain a healthy pregnancy  estrogen and progesterone  plummet after delivery.If you're feeling overwhelmed and moody after your baby arrives, you're far from alone. Here are five tips to help you weather the transition.Say yes to help and no to stressThis is the time to say ""yes"" when people ask ""Can I do anything? Asking a friend to help you unpack baby gifts or take out the recycling is a very reasonable request from a new mom. See our article on how to help a friend with a new baby for ideas on what to ask for when people offer to help.It's also time to say no when well-meaning friends and family overstay their welcome or want to give you advice. Ask someone to help manage visitors, mail, gifts, and phone calls. You need to concentrate on taking care of yourself and your baby.Stay hydrated and eat wellMaintain a stable blood sugar level and avoid mood swings by eating a small meal every few hours. Keep easy-to-eat snacks (nuts, granola bars, fresh fruit) and a water bottle within reach in areas where you spend time with the baby. Let friends cut up some fruit or make you a sandwich.Manage your painMany postpartum moms have pain during the first few weeks, whether it's from engorged breasts, a c-section, or a vaginal tear. If you're following instructions and your pain is not manageable, contact your provider's office. Or ask a friend to help make the call, if you feel like you're not up to it. You may need to adjust your medication or see your provider or a lactation consultant to find a way to ease your suffering.Pay attention to when you're feeling downAre you more emotional in the morning or do you tend to feel overwhelmed come sundown? If you notice a pattern, ask your partner or friends and family for support at that time of day.For instance, if you feel lonely and disconnected in the morning, ask a friend to set up a regular call or visit. If your mood dips in the early evening, plan to snuggle your baby and watch an episode of your favorite guilty-pleasure sitcom. Or plan a snack you find especially delicious and comforting.Connect with other momsIf you're feeling like nobody gets what's happening to you, join a moms' group. Or try an online community where everybody's going through the same thing. You'll find sympathy, understanding, and compassion.If you can't shake the bluesThe baby blues typically fade away within two weeks. If you're still feeling tearful at that point, you may have postpartum depression (PPD) or postpartum anxiety. Other symptoms include changes in appetite (eating too little or too much), an inability to sleep even though you're exhausted, having little interest in your baby, irritability or rage, obsessive thoughts about your baby's safety, or any strong emotions that interfere with your ability to function as you normally do.Read more about postpartum anxiety and depression and take our quiz to see whether you might need professional help. If you think you might hurt yourself or your baby, seek help immediately.Where to get helpFor a list of resources in your area, try Postpartum Support International's state-by-state resource guide or call the support hotline at (800) 944-4773.Sarah Best, a licensed master social worker and a psychotherapist at the Seleni Institute, a nonprofit maternal mental health center in New York, contributed to this article.Show sources Hide sources APA. 2014.

7 simple ways to save money on family travel,https://www.babycenter.com/0_7-simple-ways-to-save-money-on-family-travel_10412089.bc,"Glossy travel articles, friends' Facebook photos, and dreamy websites are all enticing when it comes to picking a vacation destination, but cost is a big consideration for most of us. After all, when three or more of you are sleeping, eating, and playing, the expenses add up fast.There's no need to pay full price, though  or anything close  when your family goes on vacation. With a few simple maneuvers, you can learn how to get in on the best deals and become a savvy bargain traveler.1. Sign up for listsThere's a wealth of websites (such as TravelZoo, Airfare Watchdog, TheFlightDeal), newsletters, and alerts (Last Minute Travel, individual airlines), Facebook pages, and other services designed to help connect price-conscious consumers with travel deals. You just need to sign up for alerts, add bookmarks, become a follower, and otherwise keep your eye out  and then act quickly when something appeals to your family.2. Play the promo gameRoom rates are like a game of roulette  it's all in how you roll. Before making a reservation, always check hotel and resort websites for promo deals such as family packages, off-season or mid-week rates, or added benefits such as free attraction tickets or meal vouchers. It's also always worth checking Groupon and other coupon sites for anything relevant.Saving vs. Spending (Mom Confidential) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:16Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:16Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videos3. Combine to saveWhen choosing flights and hotels through online booking engines like Expedia, Priceline, and Hotwire, you can't help but notice those pop-up enticements to add reservations for rental cars and other options. Don't click on them just yet! Although these combined deals really do shave dollars off the total price in many cases, it's best to take a hard look at what's on offer. Then do a bit of additional research (hint: Open another screen) to see if you can beat the cost yourself. If not, you've just checked two items off your list.4. Go localWhen booking hotels and motels, it's typical to start by visiting the websites for national chains. However, individual properties that are part of a chain may offer deals that aren't available when you book on the website. After checking with the national office, look up the local telephone number (most likely a local area code, not the 800 number) for the individual property and call direct.Be sure to ask about discounts for membership in organizations such as AAA or, if you're an older parent or grandparents are joining you, AARP. You might be surprised by what the local manager will do to get you in the door (and don't be afraid to haggle). In addition, by signing up as a ""member"" of a chain, you may also be offered discounts.5. Location, location, locationIt's as true in vacation planning as it is in real estate. If you're planning to visit a major city or popular destination and get sticker shock when you check room rates at downtown or beachfront hotels, try booking a place that's a little farther from the center  you can often cut prices by as much as half. You may also save money on parking and other amenities, which downtown hotels tend to charge for while suburban and smaller town properties do not. An added benefit: You may discover a cool new neighborhood or dining district in the process.6. Read the fine printHave you ever arrived at your destination only to be surprised by added costs for additional occupants, wi-fi, or so-called ""resort fees"" to use the pool, gym, and other features you assumed were included? Avoid being blindsided by asking ahead of time about what's included in your quoted rate and factoring in those costs when comparison shopping.7. Be flexibleSometimes that third week in July really is the only time the entire family can travel together. But in most cases, there's at least a little wiggle room as to when you go and possibly how long you stay  and that's where big savings can come in.Hotel prices are much lower mid-week, and flight prices are nearly always cheaper on Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays, so traveling Tuesday to Tuesday or Saturday to Saturday can save you a huge amount over the traditional Friday to Sunday. (Many airline and travel engine websites now allow you to use a ""flexible date search"" feature, making it easier to see which travel days will save you money.)Likewise, never underestimate the value of traveling off-season. Like Europe, theme parks, zoos, and beach towns are much less crowded  and as result, more fun  in the spring and fall, even if you need to wear an extra layer or two. And a trip to, say, Costa Rica, Hawaii, or the Yucatan could easily come to a third of the price during the rainy season, and you may find it really only rains a couple of hours a day  conveniently during nap time."
HIV medication in pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_hiv-medication-in-pregnancy_10415061.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWhat are antiretrovirals, and what is antiretroviral therapy (ART)?Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is called a retrovirus, so the drugs used to treat HIV are called antiretrovirals (ARVs).HIV attacks the body's immune system and kills the infection-fighting white blood cells called CD4 cells. HIV spreads when viral DNA gets incorporated into a CD4 cell's DNA, and HIV ""hijacks"" the CD4 cell's system to copy the virus. This is called the HIV life cycle.ARVs can't cure HIV, but they can stop the virus from making copies of itself, or replicating.There are six classes of ARV. Each type targets a different stage in the HIV life cycle, so combining several types of ARV into one treatment is the most effective way of treating HIV. This treatment is known as antiretroviral therapy, or ART.ART is very effective. It can lower the amount of HIV in the body to levels that are almost too small to detect, helping you stay healthy and live longer. It also means you're less likely to pass the virus on to sexual partners.During pregnancy, ART reduces the risk of passing HIV on to your baby.Is ART recommended during pregnancy?Experts recommend ART for everyone who is HIV positive. ART reduces the amount of HIV in the body (the viral load). But it's especially beneficial if you're pregnant or planning to get pregnant.If your viral load is low, the risk of passing HIV to a baby during pregnancy and delivery is low. Taking ART can reduce your baby's risk of contracting HIV to 1 percent or less.When you're getting treatment, that means your baby is too. Some ART medications can pass from you to your unborn baby through your placenta. These medications help protect your baby from becoming infected with HIV.If you were already on ART before becoming pregnant, it's possible that your healthcare provider may revise your ART regimen or your dose. Some HIV medications may not be as safe to use during pregnancy, or your body may respond to them differently.If you're not on ART (either because you didn't want to be or because you have just been diagnosed with HIV), your provider may recommend you start right away.Are antiretroviral drugs safe to take during pregnancy?Many HIV medicines are considered safe to take during pregnancy. Research is ongoing, but there doesn't seem to be a clear link between HIV medicines and birth defects. There have been some concerns that ART could be associated with an increased risk of some pregnancy complications, such as preterm birth, but there's a lot that isn't known.You won't be given any drugs that are known to be dangerous for a developing baby, but there isn't a lot of safety data for most of the newer medications.On the other hand, the effects of not treating HIV are well known, and the U.S. Public Health Service currently recommends that women receive medication unless known adverse effects outweigh benefits. In all cases, your provider should inform you of the potential risks, benefits, and unknowns of your treatment options, and involve you in the decision-making process.When you see your HIV provider, be sure you ask plenty of questions about the medication you're taking. Tell her about any other medication you're taking or plan to take, including vitamin supplements and herbal remedies  these could influence how effective ART is. She will tell you what is known about the potential risks and benefits of your medication options.You'll also want to know about common side effects. These don't usually last long but might include nausea, diarrhea, headaches, or tiredness. Your provider can give you medication to help you manage these.Possible longer term side effects include:bone thinning (osteoporosis)a buildup or loss of body fat in particular areas of the body (lipodystrophy)high levels of fat in your blood (hyperlipidemia)By having this information, you can be involved in deciding if a particular HIV drug is right for you. Your provider will monitor you for signs of any complications during your prenatal appointments. Don't stop taking ART or make changes to your regimen without talking to your provider.There is continuing research into the safety of all HIV medications. If you're taking HIV medicines during pregnancy, your provider may ask you to voluntarily enroll in the Antiretroviral Pregnancy Registry.This registry contributes to the research by monitoring exposure to HIV medicines in pregnancy. The aim of doing this is to detect any risk of birth defects caused by HIV medications.How do I pay for ART?If you have health insurance, you'll be covered for some medicines used to treat HIV. If you don't have health insurance, or you can't afford your co-payment or co-insurance amount, help is available.Medicaid may pay for your treatment during pregnancy and after you deliver your baby. Medicaid income limits are higher for HIV treatment during pregnancy, so even if you thought you didn't qualify, it's worth checking again.There are also other government and community programs that you may be eligible for. Your healthcare provider or local public health department can help you find out what's available.What is adherence, and why is it so important?Adherence means taking your ART exactly as prescribed. Missing a dose, or taking it at the wrong time, can quickly result in an increase in the viral load. This can put your health, and your baby's health, at risk.Drug resistance can also develop if you miss doses. This happens when the drugs you've been taking no longer work against HIV.Remembering to take your ART may not sound difficult, but it's not unusual to struggle with it. You could be taking several tablets at different times each day. Some ART medication has to be taken with food, or at particular times before or after a meal.Even if you're usually good at taking your ART, you may have problems when you're expecting. Nausea in early pregnancy could mean you don't feel like eating at regular times, and tiredness may throw off your normal schedule.It's important that you're honest with your healthcare provider and let her know if you're not able to follow your regimen. She may be able to move you to an easier combination of ARVs or offer support to help you stay on track.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2012.

Pregnancy blahs: Bored with pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pregnancy-blahs-bored-with-pregnancy_218.bc,"I'm sick of being pregnant! Is something wrong with me?Nope, it's perfectly normal to feel that way. Many women get tired of being pregnant during the third trimester (and some even earlier). What's exciting and new during the first few weeks and months of pregnancy can become pretty tedious by the sixth or seventh month.Let's face it, there's nothing particularly thrilling about having to roll out of bed sideways, groan every time you stand up, and pee umpteen times a day. Sure, you may get offered a seat on the train, but you also face little delights like stretch marks and heartburn. It's enough to wipe the rosy glow from even the most excited mom-to-be.However, if your pregnancy blahs start to feel more like persistent blues or anxiety that's affecting your ability to function, talk to your healthcare provider. Although mood swingsare common in pregnancy (especially among women who suffer from PMS), feeling chronically bored and listless could be a symptom ofdepression.Postpartum depression gets more media attention, but at least 10 percent of women have bouts of depression during pregnancy. Untreated depression isn't good for you, so it's important to get treatment. Fortunately, most cases of pregnancy-related depression can be treated by a supportive therapist and withantidepressant medicationif necessary.Dealing with othersOn top of your physical discomfort, you may find yourself enduring endless questions and comments from others about your pregnancy. ""Once I started showing, no one at work ever talked to me about anything but being pregnant,"" recalls Susan Greer, an accountant and mother of one from New Hampshire. ""By the sixth month, I wanted that baby out and my body and identity back.""And then there are the unsolicited comments on your physique. ""I'm always getting 'Wow, you aresobig!' comments, advice I didn't ask for, andpeople touching my stomach,"" a mom-to-be writes in the BabyCenter Community. ""As if I'm notalreadyannoyed because of how uncomfortable I am!""Many women get tired of conversation that focuses on their growing body. Try steering conversation back to non-pregnancy topics  even if it's just the weather or the latest reality TV show. Feel free to tell your family and close friends that you feel like talking about things that have nothing to do with food cravings and not being able to see your feet.Also, give yourself permission to vent when you feel the need. When family and friends (or even life partners) need a break from pregnancy talk, you can count on finding a sympathetic ear in other moms-to-be. Commiserate and trade advice with other women due the same month as you in theBabyCenter Community. Inside pregnancy: Weeks 28 to 37A 3D animated look at a baby in the third trimester of pregnancy. Savoring your timeDespite all the annoyances you're weathering, now's the time to enjoy your last weeks or months of pre-baby freedom. During the months  and years!  after your baby is born, time to yourself will be a precious commodity.Some women use the days to plan for their newborn's arrival, setting up the nursery and shopping for supplies or mapping out the details of maternity leave and daycare. You might try putting togetherscrapbooksof your pregnancy and baby shower, taking a parenting class at your local health center, orlearning lullabies.Sometimes, though, you need a break from all things baby-related. Go ahead and plan activities, take on tasks, and dabble in hobbies that a new mom couldn't possibly squeeze into her busy schedule. Some ideas:Make lunch or phone dates with friends.""I figure I won't have a good in-depth conversation with most of my friends for at least six months after my twins are born,"" one woman writes in the BabyCenter Community.Learn something new.Take a chance on books at the library that you normally wouldn't pick up. ""I started reading an astronomy book so I can learn some constellations. Who knows, maybe I'll talk to my baby about the stars during our midnight feedings,"" mom-to-be Barbara muses in the BabyCenter Community.Streamline your space.Clean out your files, sift through the junk in the kitchen drawer, or put those boxed-up prints in the closet into photo albums. There's plenty of organizing you can do around the house that won't strain you physically, and once you're in mom-mode you'll be thankful for the reduced clutter.Treat yourself to a massage.""I feel tons better after the prenatal massage I just got. If you feel miserable, go get one! It's well worth the money,"" Ceri writes in a BabyCenter Community post. For a less expensive treat, spring for a hair blowout or soothing pedicure instead.Set up shortcuts to save time  and your sanity.Collect takeout menus from restaurants around town, prepare freezer meals, and start your babysitter search so that help is readily available during the hectic first months.Try a new exercise routine. Physical activity is a sure way to boost your mood and energy. Recruit a friend to go for a walk, take a swim, check out a prenatal yoga class, or try another way to get your body moving. (Check in with your healthcare provider first, in case there's a medical reason for avoiding exercise.)Pick up gardening.""Starting a garden really helped me get over my third-trimester boredom,"" says New Hampshire mom Susan Greer.

Glucose screening and glucose tolerance tests,https://www.babycenter.com/0_glucose-screening-and-glucose-tolerance-tests_1483.bc,"Why do I need a glucose screening test during pregnancy?Most healthcare practitioners routinely recommend a glucose screening test (also called a glucose challenge test or GCT) between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy to check for gestational diabetes.Gestational diabetes is a high blood sugar condition that some women get during pregnancy. Between 2 and 5 percent of expectant mothers develop this condition, making it one of the most common health problems during pregnancy. And because the condition rarely causes any symptoms, testing is the only way to find out whether you have it.Like any screening test, the GCT won't give you a diagnosis. Instead, it's designed to identify as many women as possible who may have a problem and need more testing to find out. So a positive result doesn't mean that you have gestational diabetes.In fact, only about a third of women who test positive on the glucose screen actually have the condition. If you test positive on the screening, you'll need to take the glucose tolerance test (GTT)  a longer, more definitive test that tells you for sure whether you have gestational diabetes.Your practitioner may want you to be screened earlier than 24 weeks if a routine urine test shows a lot of sugar in your urine or if you're considered high risk. If the results are normal, you'll be screened again at 24 to 28 weeks.Of course, if you were diagnosed with diabetes before pregnancy, you won't need to be screened. Instead, you'll continue to work with your practitioner to manage your condition during pregnancy.Weight gain and pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:25Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:25Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosHow is the glucose screening test done?When you arrive for the test, you're given a sugar solution that contains 50 grams of glucose. The stuff tastes like a very sweet soda pop (it comes in cola, orange, or lime flavor), and you have to get all of it down in five minutes. Some centers keep it chilled or let you pour it over ice and drink it cold.An hour later (bring something to read!), a blood sample is taken from your arm to check your blood sugar level. The idea is to see how efficiently your body processes sugar. The results should be available in a few days.If the reading is too high, which happens 15 to 23 percent of the time, you'll be asked to come back for a three-hour glucose tolerance test to see whether you really do have gestational diabetes. The good news is that most women whose screening test shows elevated blood sugar don't turn out to have gestational diabetes.Will the test make me feel sick?Some moms-to-be feel nauseated after drinking the glucose solution, and a few even throw up. It may help to eat something a few hours before the screening test. If you vomit soon after you've gotten the drink down, you'll have to come back on another day and repeat the test.It's actually more common for women to feel sick during the three-hour glucose tolerance test, because the solution for that test may be twice as sweet or contain twice as much liquid as the one for the screening test, and you have to drink it after fasting. What is an abnormal blood glucose level?Different practitioners use different standards for determining whether your level is too high. Some will say that if your one-hour blood sugar level is 140 milligrams of glucose per deciliter of blood plasma (mg/dL) or more, you need to have the glucose tolerance test. Others put the cutoff at 130 mg/dL to catch more women who may have gestational diabetes, even though there are likely to be more false positives this way.If your blood glucose level for this screening is higher than 200 mg/dL, most practitioners will consider you diabetic and you won't be required to take the glucose tolerance test. But any score between 140 and 200 means that you'll have to take the three-hour glucose tolerance test for a definite diagnosis.What's the glucose tolerance test like?The exact procedure varies, but typically you're instructed to eat a late meal the night before the test. After that you may be told not to eat or drink anything but sips of water, so you'll want to schedule the test for first thing in the morning.When you arrive for the test, a blood sample is taken to measure your fasting blood glucose level. Then you drink either a more concentrated dose or a larger volume of the glucose solution. At that point, brace yourself for three more arm pricks, as your blood is tested every hour for the next three hours. The technician should alternate arms each time your blood is drawn.You'll definitely want to bring something to distract you, because you have to stay seated in the waiting room when your blood is not being drawn. Also bring something to eat right after the final blood sample is taken, because you'll probably be starving.If one of the readings is abnormal, you may have to take another test later in your pregnancy. Or your practitioner may ask you to make some changes in your diet and exercise routine.If two or more of your readings are abnormal, you'll be diagnosed with gestational diabetes. Your practitioner will talk to you about a treatment plan.This chart shows the levels that the American Diabetes Association considers abnormal at each interval of the test:IntervalAbnormal readingFasting95 mg/dl or higher1 hour180 mg/dl or higher2 hours155 mg/dl or higher3 hours140 mg/dl or higherWhat happens if I'm diagnosed with gestational diabetes?You'll work with your practitioner or a diabetes specialist and possibly a nutritionist to come up with a plan to manage your condition.Your high blood sugar should only last as long as your pregnancy. But some women who develop diabetes during pregnancy still have it after delivery, so you'll have to take another glucose test six to eight weeks after your baby is born.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2011.

How to enjoy a plane trip with young children,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-enjoy-a-plane-trip-with-young-children_65317.bc,"Like many parents with young children, you may have a fear of flying that has nothing to do with the aircraft and everything to do with the possibility of a tantrum at 30,000 feet. In close quarters. In front of strangers.But don't worry. With careful and creative planning, you can help ensure that tensions don't rise when the plane does. Here are some child-tested suggestions from travel experts  flight attendants, travel agents, and frequent-flyer parents  for successful plane trips with young children.Booking your flightNonstop flights are often preferable because there's only one ear-popping descent to worry about. (Young children can have a hard time handling the uncomfortable pressure changes of landing.) Also, with nonstop flights you avoid the hassle of lugging everything and everyone to a connecting flight.On the other hand, depending on the length of your flight and the temperament of your child, you may want to schedule a layover. Some parents find that splitting international or long domestic flights into two legs is helpful because it lets their children stretch their legs and enjoy a brief change of scenery.If you're catching a connecting flight, New York travel agent Rabia Shahenshah suggests budgeting at least an hour for the connection.If you don't want to battle crowds, avoid peak flying hours. The emptier flights depart late at night, at midafternoon, and early in the week. If avoiding potential delays is a higher priority for you, consider booking the first flight of the day.Most important, view the journey through your child's eyes as much as possible. What time of day would be best for him? Will he be tired enough to sleep? Too excited to sleep at all? You're the expert when it comes to your child's personality and scheduling needs.When booking your flight, ask if there are any discounted seats for children. Your child may be able to sit on your lap if he's younger than 2, but you both might be more comfortable if he has his own seat. Check to see if you can bring your child's car seat on board.If your flight will include meal service, you may be able to request a special meal for your child if he's a picky eater or has dietary restrictions. If special meals are offered, you'll probably need to make your request at least 24 hours before takeoff. Don't count on the airline to keep your child supplied with snacks: Pack what you know he likes.If your child has cold symptoms, you might want to schedule an appointment with your doctor before the flight. Your child could have a mild ear infection, and you don't want to find that out on the flight. An infected eardrum can rupture during the descent, causing excruciating pain and permanent hearing damage. If this is a possibility, you may need to postpone your flight.As you plan your trip, use our checklist of questions to ask your airline when flying with small children. Getting to the airportIn her 28 years as a flight attendant, Chicago-based Cheryl Kinkead has witnessed countless parenting successes and disasters. She suggests arriving at the airport early so you can get (or confirm) seat assignments ahead of the crowd. Otherwise, you risk being separated from your child if it's a full flight.Another reason to arrive early: bulkhead seating. Many parents swear by these front-row seats because of the increased legroom and proximity to the lavatories. Normally, these seats are reserved for frequent flyers or travelers with disabilities until the day of the flight. Then any remaining spots go up for grabs.But bulkhead seats have drawbacks, too. For one thing, says Lani Leydig, a travel agent based in San Mateo, California, there's no under-seat storage: If you request bulkhead seats, say good-bye to your carry-ons until the ""fasten seat belt"" sign is turned off.Giving yourself plenty of time at the airport eases the stress of clearing security and getting to the gate. And if your child gets anxious or suddenly goes into meltdown mode, you can pause to calm him down.Before your trip, check your airline's policies on baggage allowances and checking items at the gate. Most airlines allow you to check a stroller just before you board the plane, and some even let you bring umbrella strollers on board.Going through securityVisit the U.S. Transportation Security Administration's (TSA) website to review the latest security checkpoint procedures. Check the rules for what you can bring in your carry-on bags and what needs to be declared at security, and prepare accordingly.Expressed breast milk, formula, and juice are allowed in ""reasonable quantities"" for the flight. You might want to bring an empty bottle or sippy cup that you can fill after you clear security.When you arrive at the security checkpoint, look for the ""family lane"" marked with a green sign or ask a TSA officer to point you in the right direction. The family lane is for people who might need a little more time getting through security, so you can help your family without feeling rushed by impatient fellow travelers.Babies need to be taken out of strollers and carriers at the checkpoint, and older children need to walk through the screening devices on their own. Everything you bring with you  including stuffed toys, a favorite blanket, the stroller  must go through the X-ray machine.You can practice going through security with your toddler or preschooler before the trip, so he's prepared to climb out of the stroller, take off his jacket, and set his carry-on items on the conveyor belt.The waiting gameWhile you wait to board, encourage your child to expend as much energy as possible so he'll either sleep or relax during the flight.Some airports have play areas complete with blocks, slides, crawl spaces, and the like. There may be other attractions to engage your kids: Chicago's O'Hare airport has a children's museum, for example, and San Francisco International Airport features an aquarium.If you find yourself in one of these child-friendly airports, it's important to establish a time limit right away. Keep reminding your child that it will soon be time to go  this may avoid a tantrum later.If your child is anxious, this is also a good time to calm his fears about flying and help him feel comfortable with the transition from ground to air, says Georgie Chambers, a mother of three from Davis, California.Ask him what he thinks takeoff will feel like. What will the plane look like inside? What kinds of sounds will it make as it takes off and lands?Reiterate your travel plans to your child. Remind him where you're going and what you'll be doing there, so he knows what to expect.This is also a good time to talk about behavior on the plane. If you anticipate trouble, try using a reward system to manage your child's in-flight behavior. Explain that he'll receive a special treat  a gift, some special time spent together, a trip to the ice-cream shop  if he sits quietly.And don't forget to make a pit stop before boarding, to cut down on trips to the tiny airplane bathroom. BoardingTo preboard or not to preboard? It's a long-standing debate. Many airlines allow families with young children to board early, but some are phasing out this practice. Some families say it's best to board early to ensure finding plenty of storage space. Preboarding also gives you time to properly position your child's car seat.That said, your child might not be thrilled about being confined in a cramped cabin. Airplanes tend to be stuffy before a flight, and you never know how long you'll have to wait before takeoff. That's why some parents prefer to wait until the last moment before boarding.If you're traveling with another adult, one of you could board early with your bags and gear while the other stays at the gate with your child.During the flightOnce the flight is under way, it's time to play Santa Claus. (Santa flies, too, right?) Every hour or so, give your little one a gift to unwrap.The presents don't have to be fancy or expensive  they might include books, snacks, or stickers. But make sure they're things your child has never seen before, so they'll capture his interest.A little creativity goes a long way, too. Airsickness bags decorated with crayons become puppets. A piece of paper taped to the window serves as a sticker gallery.Your smartphone, MP3 player, laptop, or tablet is another favorite tool for keeping kids happy and quiet on a flight. If you have firm limits on screen time at home, this can be a special treat for the flight.Don't expect he'll keep himself busy while you relax with a book. Explain the sights as the plane takes off and lands. Take an active interest in the things that amuse him. The more secure he feels, the happier his trip will be.Your child probably will want to walk around. If the aisles are free of carts and the seat belt sign is off, take him for a stroll. He may even meet other children his age.In the confines of the cabin, it's okay to be a little more lax with discipline than you normally would be. Conduct that you ordinarily wouldn't tolerate may be preferable to the protests that you could provoke by being too strict.If your child does reach the boiling point, remind him that he will lose his reward for good behavior. And if he still doesn't cooperate, it's important to follow through  don't give in and give him his reward once you're off the plane. If he learns that Mommy and Daddy are softies in public, his behavior in these situations will only get worse.Barring any outbursts, the most difficult part of the flight is the descent. As the plane changes altitude, pressure builds up and ears start to pop. Your little one won't know how to relieve the pressure, so he'll need your help to ease the discomfort.Play a game in which you make funny faces or yawn at each other. This will get him to stretch his facial muscles and move his jaw, just as adults do to relieve ear pressure. Encourage him to nurse if he's breastfeeding, or have a bottle, sippy cup, or juice box ready for him because swallowing also helps.Back at the gate, it pays to wait while other passengers leave the plane. The flight attendants will most likely help those bringing up the rear  including children and their tired parents.Bon voyage!"
Road trip survival guide: Don't leave home without our kid-friendly tips,https://www.babycenter.com/0_road-trip-survival-guide-dont-leave-home-without-our-kid-fri_1451324.bc,"Logging long miles in the car can be exhausting for everyone, from uncomfortable moms-to-be to cranky babies and active preschoolers tired of being cooped up. Read on for BabyCenter's parent-tested (and kid-tested) guide to managing road trips without meltdowns.Safety firstBefore you hit the road, make sure your child's car seat is installed properly  nearly three out of four aren't.Pack plenty of water, a first-aid kit, a flashlight, and basic car safety equipment, such as jumper cables. Make sure your road assistance plan is up to date. Charge your phone before you leave, and bring a phone charger and an extra battery. (Consider getting one that's solar-powered.)Get a good night's sleep before you go. This is essential: Sleep deprivation can contribute to frazzled nerves and even unsafe driving. (It's helpful if your children are well-rested at the start of the trip too.)Think about seating arrangementsIf you have more than one child and don't have a minivan, consider renting one. (Reserve well in advance, especially during the summer.) You'll have more space to pack gear and more flexibility about where everyone sits.Take your own car seats, even if you use a van with built-ins. Your kids might find them more comfortable for the long haul or like the option to switch it up. Also, it's good to be prepared with car seats when you get to your destination in case someone else drives or you take a taxi.Pack strategicallyPack everything you want easy access to on the road separately so you won't have to dig around in a suitcase. For example, keep jackets and hats within easy reach. And tuck basic outdoor supplies, such as sunscreen and mosquito repellent, in their own bag for outdoor fun along the way.If you're heading to a warm climate, pack swimsuits and towels in a beach bag  you never know when you might stumble on a great watering hole. It's also a good idea to have a change of clothes, wipes, and sealing plastic bags handy for you and your kids in case of a diaper blowout, motion sickness, or another mess.See our 7 essentials for car travel with kids. Plan around your child's scheduleWhen scheduling your driving time, think about when your kids usually eat and sleep. For example, you could leave a bit before lunchtime and let your kids eat in the car. Then they could nap while you log some miles.Some people buckle their pajama-clad kids into their car seats and begin their travel at bedtime. This works if you're not too tired to drive late at night  and if you're reasonably sure your children will stay asleep. If it backfires, you could end up with a wide-awake toddler at midnight.Stop at regular intervalsThe beauty of a road trip is that you can pull over and get out whenever you want.If you're pregnant, take a break every hour to walk around and do some simple stretches. Sitting anywhere for long periods of time can make your feet and ankles swell and your legs cramp. Get more tips on traveling by car while pregnant.If you're traveling with toddlers and younger kids, try not to drive more than a couple hours in one stretch. Expecting young kids to sit still much longer is pretty unrealistic.Plus, doing something fun along the way makes the car trip itself enjoyable. A quick game of tag or catch at a park or a stop at a roadside attraction can break up a drive without losing too much time.The secret is planning. Once on the road, it can be hard to know where to stop. Before you leave, ask friends who know the route to recommend pit stops. Check online for playgrounds, parks, and old-fashioned attractions such as giant statues and kitschy tourist stops.Download apps like Roadside America and Roadtrippers, which can help you discover great stops along the way, or iExit, which tells you what services  like bathrooms and gas stations  are available at upcoming highway exits.Split driving and entertainment dutiesIf you're traveling with another adult, one person can be in charge of snack distribution, storytelling, and toy rotation while the other drives. If you have space, sitting with the kids in the backseat can make things easier.Pack lots of snacksKeep plenty of drinks and snacks on hand. Food that travels well includes rice cakes, pretzels, bagels, granola bars, raisins or other dried fruit, and O-shaped cereal. Bring an insulated bag for string cheese, tubes of yogurt, and other perishables.Don't bother with fruit or juice boxes, which are too messy for younger kids. Instead, bring dried fruit and spillproof sippy cups. Pit stopsNo matter how well you prepared or how set you are on making it to your destination by bedtime, you'll have to stop along the way.Whether you're pregnant or traveling with a baby, toddler, or older kid in tow, parks and rest stops are perfect picnic spots. They're a great way to get a bit of fresh air and exercise. Nothing relieves a child's pent-up physical energy better than running around outside. Bring a ball for some fun playtime.If winter weather makes outdoor play impossible, a mall with a food court is another option. There's room to roam, and many have a central play area.Here are some other tips for eating on the road:If you're pregnant, stretching your legs (and back, and everything else) probably will be a top priority  after finding a bathroom, of course. Instead of long stops at sit-down restaurants, swing by a market where you can walk around while you pick out something to eat. Many have cases of prepared foods for people on the go.If you're traveling with a baby, plan mealtimes for when your baby is awake and alert, and choose baby-friendly locations. If weather permits, it's more relaxing to let your baby roll around on a blanket at a park or rest stop than to try to keep her quiet in a restaurant.If you want to use expressed breast milk, keep it in a cooler with ice or frozen cold packs for up to 24 hours. To warm it, hold the bottle under running water or warm it in a bowl of warm water. (You could also bring it in a thermos.)If your baby drinks formula, pack bottles of premeasured powdered formula and a thermos of warm water. When your baby's ready to eat, simply add the warm water to a bottle, shake, and serve. Or just buy a pack of ready-to-use formula.If you're traveling with toddlers and older kids, search for kid-friendly restaurants with your phone or tablet. Look for a restaurant with an outdoor area, where kids can play and color the menus. Bring along toys to entertain your little one or play games such as ""I Spy.""Many restaurants offer discounted or even free kids' meals, so always ask for a kids' menu. Kids Meal Deals helps you find restaurants with special discounts and deals for children, though sometimes they're only offered at specific times or on certain days.EntertainmentKeep everyone happy with car activities, songs, stories, and more. Here are some suggestions:If you're pregnant, consider listening to podcasts or audiobooks as an alternative to the radio. You can get free audiobooks at your library or online. Or use a music streaming app such as Spotify  you could even create a road-trip playlist before you go.If you're traveling with a baby, bring an activity mat or other travel-friendly toy. Choose soft, securely attached toys for your child so a sudden stop won't make her bump into hard plastic.Entertain older babies by reading aloud from picture books or board books. If you're the only adult, look for kids' audiobooks. Check out the ones at your library or record your own at home. Sing-alongs and nursery rhymes are always crowd pleasers.If you're traveling with a toddler, audiobooks with fairy tales and other familiar stories are your best bet for keeping toddlers' attention. Songs and singing games (think ""Where Is Thumbkin?"") are also entertaining.Popular TV shows, such as Sesame Street and Dora the Explorer, or a kid-friendly movie will also do the trick. (Read more about screen time for kids.)Other activities that work well for toddlers include sticker books, magnetic storyboards, drawing boards, and other toys that don't involve lots of small pieces or make a gooey mess. A baking sheet can be used to play with magnets and doubles as a playing surface so crayons and toy cars don't easily roll and slide away.If you're traveling with older kids, try audiobooks or download free stories from StoryNory.Cracker Barrel, the nationwide chain of 600 restaurants and stores, offers an audiobook rental program. Here's how it works: Buy an audiobook at any Cracker Barrel location and when you finish it, return the book to any Cracker Barrel. The purchase price minus a nominal weekly rental fee will be refunded.Games are another great way to keep older kids entertained. You can find travel versions of many popular games, from Scrabble to Battleship. Choose wisely, though: The best ones for car trips have pieces that slide or are attached by magnets.Digital games are terrific for travel, with no pieces to pick up! Geography apps are an especially smart choice when you're on the road  some great options are Stack the States, Geography Drive USA, and Google Earth.A travel journal can keep kids busy and capture memories of your family trip. Give each child a notebook and washable crayons or markers. You could even pack a glue stick or double-sided tape for adding postcards, ticket stubs, and other mementos from your trip.Prevent backseat meltdownsFussy babies and squabbling siblings can turn a road trip into torture. Try some of these sanity-savers to keep the peace:Get off to a good start. Well-fed, well-rested children equipped with toys are less apt to get cranky or fight with each other in the car.Join the kids. If you have a baby or toddler and are traveling with another adult, try riding in the back seat with your child. Your company may be enough to ward off any fussy fits, and you can offer snacks, toys, and help with car activities like sticker books.Divide and conquer. In a van, separate siblings in different rows for some stretches of the drive. If you're in a smaller car and you have room, stick pillows between your kids to give each their own space. Don't expect very young children to share  make sure there are enough diversions for each.Defuse drama. If a fight erupts, distract older children by organizing a car game. And when the going gets tough, pull over and take a break. You want to arrive at your destination safely and still on speaking terms, even if takes you a little longer than planned. A chance to stretch your legs, play a game of tag, or just breathe some fresh air can help you all recharge.Learn more:Family vacation disasters, and how to avoid themTravel resources for children with special needsHow to travel successfully with young kidsShow sources Hide sources CDC. 2015.

"Moms and money: How to beat spending guilt, financial stress, and more",https://www.babycenter.com/0_moms-and-money-how-to-beat-spending-guilt-financial-stress-a_2422237.bc,"You probably didn't think twice about buying yourself a new pair of jeans or a grande latte before your baby arrived. Now that you're a mom, however, you may find yourself constantly pinching pennies  or feeling guilty when you don't.In an exclusive survey of more than 3,000 moms and moms to be, BabyCenter uncovered a mountain of money anxiety, including fear of not having enough and overwhelming guilt about spending and saving habits.Raising kids costs a bundle these days, so it makes sense that we moms have money on our mind. But beyond just dollars and cents, there's a huge emotional component to how we spend, splurge, and save. So BabyCenter went to the experts  financial advisers and psychologists who specialize in financial issues  to find out how to banish money stress. Read on for the big findings, the experts' best tips, and the keys to feeling confident about your financial situation.Finding 1: We feel guilty about how we spend.Key stat: 57 percent of moms feel guilty when they spend money on themselves.What's behind it:We put everyone else first.Spending guilt is common among women because we're still getting the message that our needs are less important, says psychotherapist Kate Levinson, who leads workshops for women to explore their emotional relationship to money. And when we become moms, our desires are pushed even further down the priority list. ""On a deep level, we think our value comes from taking care of others,"" Levinson says. Finance expert and author Gary Buffone works with mothers  even very wealthy ones  who have trouble shopping for things they genuinely need. ""When I recommend that they take care of themselves first, they look at me like I'm a three-eyed monster,"" Buffone says.We have less money now that we're moms.Raising kids is so expensive these days that many couples find there's not much left over after paying for essentials like childcare, baby gear, and diapers. Plus, if we quit working to be a stay-at-home mom or lost pay while taking maternity leave, our budget often feels extra tight. Even if it doesn't, some stay-at-home moms feel uncomfortable spending money they didn't ""earn"" themselves. Levinson recalls a client who was reluctant to spend money after she quit her teaching job  even though her family is well-off. ""She was able to buy for her kids, but not for herself,"" says Levinson. ""She was uncomfortable being dependent on her husband, and she felt that if she made her needs small, she wouldn't feel so indebted to him.""We may not have adjusted our finances to fit our growing family.Having a baby is a financial shock for many families. It's hard to realize beforehand just how quickly your baby will outgrow her clothes and what it costs to take mommy-and-me classes or hire a babysitter. Your budget may take a major hit  and you may be consumed by fear and guilt about spending.What you can do:Take a hard look at your budget  and build in some spending on yourself.Create a spending plan, says Candace Bahr, a financial adviser and cofounder of the Women's Institute for Financial Education. Track your spending for a month, then take a look at the necessities (your rent or mortgage, utilities, and savings) and the nonessential items and decide where you can cut back.If you can, set aside money to spend on ""extras"" like entertainment, outings, shopping, and so on. ""That way, you'll feel justified spending money on yourself because it's already planned,"" says Buffone. ""It's easier to spend on yourself when you don't feel like you're stealing from Peter to pay Paul."" Many couples use a joint credit card for such expenses, because it allows them to keep an eye on their spending.Get on the same page with your spouse or partner.Whether you're staying home with your kids, working and earning less than your spouse, or earning more, it's important for you to feel like you're in a financial partnership with your spouse or significant other. Talk about your feelings regarding spending, and make sure both of you are involved in the nitty-gritty of your finances. That means paying bills together, balancing the checkbook each month, and going over bank statements.If you don't normally handle the bills, getting involved will help relieve some of your anxiety about financial issues. And if you usually take care of the accounting, your partner will get a better sense of the family budget. Make sure you and your partner agree on how to spend any money that's left over each month after paying the bills. ""That way, no one feels like they're being cheated,"" says psychologist Jacqueline Plumez.Give yourself a salary.If paid, stay-at-home moms would earn $138,095 per year for their roles as housekeeper, cook, daycare center teacher, van driver, and psychologist, among other things. That's according to Salary.com, which tracks compensation data.Few families can afford six figures, but experts advise setting up a salary for a stay-at-home parent that fits in the family budget. It's a concrete way to recognize that parent's contributions to the family's financial health and can help her or him avoid spending guilt.Another option if you're a stay-at-home parent with a little time to spare is to make money on the side with a home-based business. Some parents sell the clothing their children have outgrown on eBay; others operate their own stationery businesses; still others sell kitchenware or designer clothing.Splurge (responsibly) on yourself.Still having a tough time spending on yourself? ""Practice the 'nonhabitual,'"" says Olivia Mellan, a professional speaker, money coach, and author of four books on money and relationships. ""Do what doesn't come naturally to you. Force yourself to spend money on things that make you feel nurtured or loved."" Consider spending on something for your mind or soul  like a class at a local community college  rather than buying something, says Mellan. The payoff? You'll be in a better mind-set to care for your family. ""It's important to do something nice for yourself once a week  even if it's small,"" Buffone says. (For ideas, see the splurges that are worth it, according to moms in our survey.) Finding 2: We want only the best for our babies.Key stats: 90 percent of moms are more likely to splurge on something for their child than on something for themselves. 61 percent spend more on their child's clothing than on their own.What's behind it:Spending on our kids feels good. It's easy to justify splurging on your child  especially if it's for a toy or gadget that might build his brain or make him laugh. ""You feel like you're accomplishing something,"" says Norma Feshbach, a developmental and clinical psychologist and professor emeritus of psychological studies in education at University of California, Los Angeles.Plus, buying things for our children gives us the high of shopping, without the guilt that can accompany spending on ourselves. ""You can experience the splurge vicariously because of your close relationship with your child,"" says Feshbach. And doing nice things for your child goes hand-in-hand with motherhood. ""We see ourselves as nurturers, so [buying is] a knee-jerk reaction: 'I want my child to feel special, beautiful, most loved,'"" says Mellan.There's a lot of pressure to buy the latest and greatest for our kids.We live in a child-centric and materialistic society, so it's ""buy, buy, buy,"" says Feshbach. And many of us feel that we're not good enough moms unless we give our kids more, says Levinson.We're trying to make up for things we can't always provide.There's another reason moms splurge on their kids: guilt. ""Many parents feel guilty that they're not giving their kids enough time or attention,"" says Buffone. ""Then they try to make it up by giving them gifts and 'stuff.'""What you can do:Ask yourself why you're splurging on your child.""Once a parent provides the essentials, everything else is gravy,"" says Buffone. ""It's okay to buy your child special gifts once in a while, but you have to keep an eye on why you're doing it. Parents typically do it for their own reasons; it doesn't have to do with the needs of the kids.""Just say no.""If you're constantly overindulging your children, they'll never learn the value of money,"" says Levinson. ""It's a balancing act because you want to provide your kids with the best education and toys, but you also want to teach them how to enjoy life and solve problems in ways that don't have to do with buying things or using money.""The best strategy is to say no to your child on a regular basis. ""It's important for parents to teach their children how to tolerate not having everything they want,"" says Levinson. Kids also need to understand that other people in the family have needs. ""It's healthy for kids to learn that although they are a priority, their parents matter, too,"" says Feshbach.Give your child things that aren't things.Keep in mind, spending money on your child isn't the best way to show her you love her. It's better to give her your time  even in simple ways. Let her help you cook dinner after work, read stories together at bedtime, or share a meal. Finding 3: We see having enough money as a necessity for raising kids.Key stats: 68 percent of moms say having more money makes parenting easier. 62 percent say they need more money to feel secure about their child's future. 57 percent say that finances will affect how many children they decide to have.What's behind it:Raising kids is expensive.Families are struggling to cover the cost of basics like childcare, healthcare, housing, and higher education. These costs have skyrocketed while income has stagnated or even fallen. And if one parent quits his or her job to care for a child, the loss of income can cause extra stress and anxiety.We don't always plan financially for the long term.Financial planning often gets put on the back burner when couples become parents. This isn't surprising  we have less spare time than ever, so who wants to spend it making a will or going over investments? Plus, there's an element of sticking our heads in the sand. ""Most people find it difficult to save money, so we don't even look toward the future,"" says Levinson. That can lead to a nagging feeling of worry that we don't or won't have enough.What you can do:Get your finances in order.It's crucial to have a long-term financial plan. If you need help, consider visiting a fee-only financial planner once a year. These professionals may have advice you wouldn't expect  for example, to contribute to your 401k account rather than starting a college fund for your child. You won't pay income tax on the amount you contribute, and your company may match some of your savings. ""You can always borrow for college  and your child can get scholarships  but you can't borrow for retirement,"" says Bahr. (If you have extra room in your budget, you can start a 529 plan for college savings.)Make some hard choices about your lifestyle.Decide what's most important to you. Is it living in a bigger house, being debt-free, or having a large family? These decisions are never easy, but for most families they're necessary. When it comes to having more children, perhaps money isn't so important. ""You have to ask yourself how much you need,"" says Levinson. ""Can you live more simply? We have assumptions that we have to have certain things in place before we have kids  home ownership, for example. But people throughout the world have kids without many resources."" Finding 4: We crave family time.Key stats: If money weren't an issue, 60 percent of moms would choose to take more family vacations (over buying a larger home or a nicer car, pampering themselves, or sending their kids to private school); 71 percent say they would take a pay cut to spend more time with their children.What's behind it:It feels like we're busier than ever. And though a 2007 University of Maryland study found that today's moms actually spend more quality time with their kids than their mothers did, it still doesn't seem like enough. Half the moms in that study reported not having enough time with their children  even though they cut back on housework, sleep, and free time to squeeze in four more hours a week of kid-focused time than moms had in 1965.It may be that the fast pace and distractions of modern life make it harder to enjoy the hours we do have with our kids. Plus, our children's lives may be packed with activities  soccer practice, piano lessons, and so on  that actually reduce the amount of quality family time we spend together.What you can do:Strategize ways to get more time with your kids.Flexible work arrangements are becoming more common. If possible, talk to your employer about working fewer hours, job sharing, or working from home. If this isn't an option, perhaps you could linger a little longer in the mornings or come home from work earlier in the evenings. That way, you could share breakfast or dinner  and steal an extra hour of quality family time  with your kids.Go on ""mini-vacations"" from your usual routine.Weekends can become a blur of obligations and errands if you're not careful. But you can avoid this by scheduling special experiences. ""Build vacation-like experiences into your daily life,"" advises Mellan. ""Visit beautiful places, like parks or nature preserves, near your house."" Think of what you love most about family trips. Is it the lazy hours uninterrupted by chirping cell phones and emails to return? If so, try instituting your own family e-free day. It's a day to abstain from email, but you can expand it as you see fit  to TV, cell phones, video games, and computers in general.Use the time you have wisely.Get creative about squeezing more family time into each day. ""Create an informal time budget,"" suggests Plumez. ""For a week, track what you're doing with your time. Are you spending more time watching TV than playing with your kids or talking with your husband? Watching TV is not great family time."" Try freeing up a few extra hours on the weekend by using a grocery delivery service or, if you work outside the home, by getting errands done during your lunch hour. If your child's sports teams or other activities are eating up all your family's spare time, institute a few rules: Limit your child to just one activity at a time, for example. Finding 5: We want a wife  or at least a housekeeper.Key stats: If they could get help from someone outside the home, 58 percent of moms would want cleaning help, 29 percent would want help with laundry, and 24 percent would want help with cooking.What's behind it:Moms are still doing the bulk of the housework.According to our survey, dads have really stepped up their involvement with childcare. 74 percent of moms say that their spouse or partner is regularly involved in the day-to-day care of their child. And, interestingly, 39 percent say a grandparent regularly helps out with day-to-day childcare. Still, moms are doing the lion's share of housekeeping tasks. 74 percent do all or most of the cleaning and laundry, and 62 percent do all or most of the cooking. ""Moms are burned out and stressed to the max,"" says Mellan. ""These chores represent the second shift for many moms."" Not only that, but these responsibilities cut into time for yourself  and quality time with the kids.What you can do:Consider getting low-cost  or free  help. ""Hire responsible kids in the neighborhood who will work for less money than a professional,"" advises Mellan. Or consider bartering for cleaning or cooking help. For instance, if you love to make jewelry or could provide childcare for a few hours, you could trade with a person who's willing to clean for you. You can also use co-ops to share cooking and childcare responsibilities with friends.Lower your standards.It's possible to create more time for your family if you spend less time on housework and forget the fancy meals.Finding 6: We're often the ones managing the money.Key stats: Moms are more likely to be the parent solely or mostly responsible for paying bills (49 percent of moms own this task, compared with 33 percent of dads) and managing bank accounts and investments (44 percent of moms versus 31 percent of dads). We're also more likely to be the parent in charge of monitoring the family's financial situation (32 percent of moms versus 19 percent of dads).What's behind it:We're more knowledgeable about money than ever before.The old image of Mom at the kitchen table paying the bills needs an update. Though our survey shows that mothers are still more likely to take care of that task, they're also increasingly the parent taking charge of their family's overall financial management. Moms in our survey proved to be savvy money managers  51 percent have a household budget, 64 percent have a retirement account, and 78 percent have savings or investment accounts.What you can do:Share your responsibilities  and anxieties  with others.It's a sign of progress that so many moms have the power to make financial decisions for the family. The downside, though, is that it can lead to stress over spending and saving. ""We're often afraid we're making financial mistakes,"" says Levinson.One way to take the pressure off is to keep your spouse or partner in the loop. Then, have a monthly family meeting where you can focus on the big picture. What are your financial goals five and ten years from now? Each month, come up with an achievable step to get there. For instance, you could ramp up your contributions to your 401k or 529 plan (after paying off any high-interest credit card debt, of course!).Once you've developed a family spending plan, reach out to friends for support and advice, says Levinson. ""Women talk to each other about everything  except money. There's so much we could learn from one another.""She recommends discussing money issues with a few trusted pals, then meeting regularly (perhaps once a month) to exchange ideas about saving, overspending, budgeting, credit card debt, and investing. Not only will you get a pat on the back whenever you reach a goal, but you may come away with new ideas about improving your finances."
Walt Disney World: Getting the most out of a trip (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_walt-disney-world-getting-the-most-out-of-a-trip-ages-5-to-8_67511.bc,"Walt Disney World spans 40 square miles and houses four major theme parks. The one most geared to 5- to 8-year-olds is the Magic Kingdom, based on California's Disneyland.With dozens of attractions in six themed lands, the park can feel overwhelming unless you some sort of plan in mind. You can't do it all in a day. And you  and your children  will have a lot more fun if you pace yourself and prioritize certain attractions and areas.To help you plan a great visit trip for your 5- to 8-year-old, here's a short list of Magic Kingdom highlights mapped out for one day. You can distribute them over additional days if you have the time.To find out more any of these, to buy tickets, or to make reservations of any kind, visit the Disney World website.Have a younger child? Get tips for seeing Disney World with a 2- to 4-year-old.Planning your visit to Disney WorldBy figuring out some basics beforehand and doing a bit of homework, you can avoid the Disney mistakes many parents make.Order tickets now. If you can manage it, buy tickets on the Disney World website before you go, to avoid the lines at the windows and get access to FastPass+ (see below). If you plan to stay three or more days, multiday and Park Hopper tickets are the best deal. You may also find special discounts and deals on the Disney site that aren't available at the ticket window.Character dining. To make a reservation for a Disney character meal at The Crystal Palace or Cinderella's Royal Table, book online (or call 407-939-3463) up to 180 days in advance.Arrive before the park opens. Scope out the official opening hours for the day(s) you plan to visit online. Arrive 30 minutes early, because on busy days, the park sometimes opens early. Even if it doesn't, you'll have extra time to reach the gate and beat the crowds to the most popular rides. Some Disney World resorts give guests entry into one of the theme parks an hour early on certain days. If you're staying at a resort, inquire at the front deskPerks for parents. Disney World's free Rider Switch passes let parents (and older siblings) take turns riding certain popular rides that aren't intended for small children  without standing in line all over again. Ask for details at the individual rides.The scoop on FastPass+. Disney World's free FastPass+ gives you priority boarding in a one-hour window at many popular rides at the park if you register online in advance. To sign up, you have to have a ticket, an annual pass, or a Disney World Resort room-and-ticket package. Do it early because FastPass+ spots are limited. You can reserve up to three rides for a single theme park per day of your ticket, 30 to 60 days before you go  and add more during your visit, space permitting. Find out more.Be aware of closed attractions. Look online for planned closures that coincide with your visit. It's disappointing to rush to your favorite ride, only to find that it's shut for maintenance  especially for children. If you know beforehand, you can manage the disappointment before you arrive.Sample itinerary: A day in the Magic Kingdom with a 5- to 8-year-oldMORNINGGet oriented. As you enter, pick up a park schedule to check on the times for Magic Kingdom parades (always colorful) and show times. Head first to Fantasyland, where the lines get long very quickly. You can't miss it  just make a beeline for Cinderella Castle in the middle of the park.Fantasyland sampler. The rides here are fanciful and have storybook themes, and many 5- to 8-year-olds will feel they haven't ""done"" the Magic Kingdom without sampling them. Some, however, will bore the average child age 6 and up, including It's a Small World, where a global chorus of costumed, dancing dolls serenades you as you drift by in a little boat. Others, like The Many Adventures of Winnie the Pooh and The Seven Dwarfs Mine Train take place in the dark or are fast enough and have enough special effects to thrill many 7- and 8-year-olds. If you have time, check out the 12-minute 3D movie Mickey's PhilharMagic. Viewers put on ""opera glasses"" and see a fun, musical account of some of Disney's best cartoons ever.Fairytales and princesses. When kids have had their fill of Fantasyland rides, head to Princess Fairytale Hall or Ariel's Grotto. Your child can meet Anna, Elsa, Cinderella and Rapunzel or visit The Little Mermaid in her seaside retreat. Lines at both of these attractions can be very long, so this is one of those times when FastPass+ can really help if you've planned for it.From fantasy to future. Head for Tomorrowland right next door and have lunch before the big noontime crowds hit. A good choice: Cosmic Ray's Starlight Caf, which serves up chicken, burgers, sandwiches, and salads  something for everyone in the family.AFTERNOONTomorrowland today. Spend the early part of the afternoon in Tomorrowland, where you'll find plenty of rides perfect for 5- to 8-year-olds. Buzz Lightyear's Space Ranger Spin puts children in a spaceship and keeps score as they zap enemies with laser cannons. At the Tomorrowland Speedway, they can drive on a racetrack (if 54+ inches tall) or ride as a passenger (if 32+ inches tall). On the Astro Orbitor, children can soar in a rocket ship high above the ground. And while Space Mountain has terrified many children  and adults  over the years, the daring ones tend to love this pitch-black ride with fast, steep twists and turns. (You must be 44 inches tall to ride.)Rest a while. Retreat to your accommodations for a few hours' rest and even a splash in the hotel pool if you're staying nearby. This is an especially good call if you plan to stay more than one day in the Magic Kingdom. If you do leave the park, you can still complete the day's itinerary by returning in late afternoon and remaining through the evening.Off to Adventureland. Travel across the park to get there. If you're crossing the park at 3 o'clock, you can catch the afternoon parade along Main Street U.S.A. on your way. Adventureland is home to the Pirates of the Caribbean, a boat journey that the movies were based on depicting the colorful exploits of a band of pirates. The Jungle Cruise, an outdoor boat ride, is also here, but many 5- to 8-year-olds find it too tame.Frontierland thrills. Next door you'll find Frontierland and Splash Mountain, a log flume ride that ends with a steep plunge (minimum height: 40 inches). Kids should also be prepared to get wet. If they're terrified by watching others on the ride, it's too scary for them. Because lines at Splash Mountain can get extremely long, FastPass+ comes in handy if you have it.A coaster and some caves. The bone-rattling Big Thunder Mountain Railroad coaster is just plain fun for those who like roller coasters and are at least 40 inches tall. It's fast, but nowhere near as scary as Space Mountain. At Tom Sawyer Island, reached by river raft, kids can run around a bit and explore dark caves.EVENINGCool characters. Show up for your character dinner if you have reservations. (Even with a reservation you may have to wait a bit, but without one there's little chance of getting seated.) The serve-yourself, buffet-style Crystal Palace on Main Street and the full-service Cinderella's Royal Table in Fantasyland both serve child-friendly American fare. At these restaurants, Disney characters will visit your table to cuddle and pose for pictures while you eat.Return and rewind. After dinner, catch up on any rides you may have missed or go back to your child's favorites. Evening lines are shorter and the air is cooler (no sunscreen required!). Wishes Nighttime Spectacular, a brief fireworks show, is a must-see (try to stand in front of Cinderella Castle so you can watch Tinker Bell fly over the park during the show). Also check the schedule for the Main Street Electrical Parade, which runs on certain evenings.Disney World facilitiesThe park is fully equipped for families and enormous crowds, with food of every kind, stroller rentals, locker rentals, and a Baby Care Center for changing diapers, preparing formula, warming bottles, and nursing.Best time of year to visit Disney WorldDisney World is open daily year-round, including holidays, with varying hours. Summertime, weekends, and school holidays are almost always very crowded.If you can go between September and November on a weekday when school is in session, in the week after Thanksgiving (until mid-December), or in the weeks between the second week of January and Presidents' Day week in February, you're much more likely to have an enjoyable visit.Getting there by carFrom Orlando International Airport, take the airport's South exit to FL 417S, a toll road. Take exit 3 to Osceola Parkway, and then follow signs to the parking lot for the Magic Kingdom.More Disney World infoFor rates, hours, and other information, visit the Disney World website or call (407) 824-4321.To get the inside scoop on Disney World, search online for something like ""Disney World online guides"" or ""insider tips for Disney World online.""

Parents say: How to care for a newborn baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_parents-say-how-to-care-for-a-newborn-baby_9791.bc,"The first few weeks with your newborn will be chaotic. Here are a few tips from experienced parents to help make life easier.Prepare as much as you can ahead of timeFind a good lactation consultant, preferably before you give birth. My son had major feeding problems the first week or two, and I wish I had lined someone up for consultations ahead of time. It would have saved me many tears and feelings of inadequacy during a hormonally tumultuous period. MaryBeing ready food-wise when the baby comes is something I never even thought about with my first. I highly recommend cooking and freezing favorite meals. Alternatively, stock up with stuff from the frozen casserole section at the store. My husband can't cook, and we don't want to starve or live on takeout like we did after our first baby! This time I'm stocking up for at least the first six weeks. jnjnich3Stock up on food and other necessities. I was totally unprepared for how overwhelmed I'd be  meaning, I had zero time or inclination to go grocery shopping and make meals. I spent a lot of time leading up to my son's birth getting his room ready, etc., when I should have been making and freezing meals. Pizza delivery and take-out can only get you so far. LeslieTake a class on infant care through your hospital. You'll learn the basics of holding, bathing, feeding, and so on. It will make you feel much more comfortable in the first few weeks when your baby seems so fragile.

See all baby videosThe most helpful thing as far as planning ahead was setting up who would help me at certain times of the day. My husband asked for vacation for the week the baby was born, and my mom took vacation the next week. After that my sisters would call and see if I needed any help or breaks. It was great knowing I had people who could and would help me, and which times they were available. AnonAsk for  and accept  helpUse your resources  Mom, Grandma, your hospital's staff, the pediatrician, friends with kids. They love to answer questions, and remember that no question is dumb. JodiAccept help whenever offered! If friends ask you what they can do, suggest they prepare meals for you or babysit your older children. Hire someone to clean. Send the little ones to day camp. Nobody will accuse you of being selfish or a bad mother. It's the only way to keep your sanity. (And it will allow you to spend time alone with your new bundle of joy.) MartiDon't try to be a hero! New moms (myself included) get this crazy notion that they should be able to do it all themselves and be ""supermom"" right out of the gate! You will only run yourself ragged. Get your rest and accept help. If someone asks if there is anything they can do for you, say yes, and then be specific! ""Can you pick up some diapers and wipes for me?"" ""Can you help me with the vacuuming?"" People want to help, and specific requests let them know they are doing things that will really make a difference. Laura Let voicemail do the talkingIf phone calls are important, people will call back. My partner didn't understand why I wouldn't answer the phone when he was at work until he stayed home one day. Sometimes it's easier to let voicemail pick up a call. You can return the call when you feel up to it. TaritaOne thing that we did to survive the first weeks with our newborn was to leave a baby update as our answering machine message. Getting rest and sleep was so difficult those first few weeks that we turned off the ringer on the phone, changed the message periodically, thanked people for calling to check in on us and asked them to leave their messages. We promised we would get in touch with them when it was convenient. We found that people enjoyed calling to see what the new information was  the latest weight and height from the doctor visit or other tidbits such as, ""Dad changed his first diaper,"" or ""We gave Hunter his first bath."" It was a great way to keep people informed without getting overwhelmed by well-meaning interruptions. JanetAccept visitors only when you're readyDecide what your policy will be on visitors. Include some rules for relatives and friends, who sometimes believe they have a right or a duty to spend every second of the day with you and the baby. Yes, you will need lots of help, but that doesn't mean the end of your privacy, and not every visitor will be helpful. PoliRest upWhat I remember the most was trying to nap while the baby did. Let the household chores wait. You need your sleep much more than the house needs a vacuuming! DonnaDuring my daughter's first six weeks, I learned that all the articles that tell you to rest when the baby does are actually right. Whenever my daughter took her naps, I usually caught up on housework, but by 7 p.m. I was sound asleep on the floor. Whatever else you do, make sure you get your rest. It will help you and the baby. Misty Go outsideI remember the pacing around the house with a fussy baby while the sun was shining so brightly outside. When I took the baby out, I would still be holding him, so it didn't seem like much of a break. Then one day it dawned on me! I put a big comforter on the grass under a tree and put a baby quilt on top of that. Now, every day that it's nice outside, we lie in the yard. We've been doing this since Noah was a month old and he loves it! Make sure you dress your baby appropriately and be sure to stay out of the sun. It's a very relaxing way to share the outdoors with your baby. TracieKnow your limitsIf you're feeling overwhelmed, depressed, and emotionally unstable, you might have a more serious problem than just the ""baby blues."" I didn't realize I had postpartum depression until my son was almost 6 months old and I finally got the help I needed. Don't feel ashamed or guilty or that you let anyone down. Get help. It's the best thing you can do for yourself and your family. AnonMy daughter didn't sleep through the night until she was almost 2 years old, so those first few months were very difficult. At times I would feed her, change her diaper, get her comfortable and then put her in her crib, shut the door, and go sleep for an hour. It was the only way I could keep my sanity. Even though I felt guilty letting her cry, I knew that I couldn't take care of either of us when I was having trouble keeping my head on straight! Those little naps saved me. BelletoilIf you're at the end of your rope because your baby won't stop crying, and he's not hungry, cold, wet, sick or hurt, and you're afraid you're going to hurt yourself or the baby, put him in a safe place. Then step out of the room for five or ten minutes until you've calmed yourself down. Gabriel's motherEditor's note: If you feel that you can't control your anger, put your baby down in a safe place (such as a crib or play yard) and call a friend or relative to come and stay with your baby for a bit. If there's nobody you can call to come and support you in person, call the National Child Abuse Hotline at (800) 422-4453 (800-4-A-CHILD). You'll be prompted to press 1 to be forwarded to a counselor.Never shake your baby. In just five to ten seconds of shaking, a child can suffer permanent, severe damage or even death. Read more about shaken baby syndrome.Find supportive healthcare providersI remember when I brought my first child home from the hospital, I was terrified. I was so scared people would think of me as an idiot for asking dumb questions. Finally, having screwed up the first time, I found a great pediatrician who was patient herself and had a very patient and understanding nurse on staff. They answered every question, whether totally dumb or completely relevant. AnonTrust your gutI just went with my instincts  no matter what they were. I knew that I was going through a difficult time and that I would make mistakes, but I needed to do that so I could learn what was best for my baby and me. The postpartum period can do crazy things to your mind. You second-guess yourself incessantly, but you'll find that your instincts will pull you through. There's no need to justify anything to anyone. You have to concentrate on you and your little one. Mary KaeTell yourself: This, too, shall passWhen you start out, you think, ""I'm never going to be good at this,"" and then it becomes second nature. The child becomes an integral part of your life so that you couldn't imagine a time when you weren't a parent. So relax, enjoy the good and bad times, because your baby grows up so fast. Eventually, every child will sleep more (and so will you), and every child will be more independent. You'll never forget the first time your baby smiles at you or the first time she looks at you and calls you ""Mama"" or ""Dada"" or the times she falls asleep on your chest. It makes all the other frustrating stuff pale in comparison. Scott and DorindaTake it one day at a time, don't worry about next week until it gets here, and know that whatever happens  your baby won't stop crying, something is new to you, you start to panic over something  it will be okay! Your baby is just as new to this as you are. AllisonEnjoy it while it lastsWith my first baby I was just trying to get through the first couple of months! I couldn't wait until he was sleeping through the night. What a mistake that was. The best advice I can give you is that your baby will only be a newborn for a few months so breathe it in and enjoy every cry and every moment. When you start to feel like you can't handle everything that's happening, just remember that it will be over faster than you can imagine! AnonShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a.

Parents Say: Ways to save time and make life with a baby easier,https://www.babycenter.com/0_parents-say-ways-to-save-time-and-make-life-with-a-baby-easi_1397713.bc,"After your new baby arrives, feelings of joy go head-to-head with heavy eyelids, drained energy, and fragile emotions. Fortunately, there are plenty of crafty ways to save time and make daily life run more smoothly when you're caring for a baby.These tips gathered from BabyCenter moms and dads are designed to reduce stress, save time and money, and help you stay in touch with the joy of raising your child.Feeding your babyBreastfeeding""A breastfeeding station is a must. Mine has a glider, a snap-on light, water, burp cloths, the TV remote, and my tablet fully loaded with movies, shows, and stuff to read."" Jennifer""I take so many, many pictures of my baby  it's overwhelming if I don't keep it under control. Breastfeeding is one time I can really look through the photos on my phone, delete the ones I don't need to keep, enjoy the great ones, share them with family, etc.""Caroline""One of our best investments was a bedside sleeper. I don't have to get out of bed for night feedings  I just reach over and pull my baby to me. When she's done, I edge her back to her bed. Neither of us has to fully wake up, which makes getting back to sleep much easier."" SallyPumping""I bought microwaveable bags to sterilize breast pump parts, bottles, and nipples. I rinse items as I use them, put them in the bag, and microwave the bag when it's full."" Suzanne""Pump milk from one side while nursing on the other."" Melissa""One of my best discoveries is a hands-free pumping bra. I can pump while reading the newspaper and eating breakfast."" EdyFormula and bottles""Buy a 30- to 60-ounce plastic pitcher and mix up 30 or more ounces of formula at once. It's good for 24 hours once mixed (refrigerated), and it saves you from having to mix the powdered formula with water for each feeding."" Julie""I have a small [dorm] refrigerator in the twins' room where I store the evening and morning bottles. I have a bottle warmer too, so we can easily feed them in their room without having to run downstairs."" Brian and KatieOnce your baby's started solids""I prepare a week's worth of baby cereal at a time, measuring out the right amount of dry cereal in individual bowls or cups with lids. Then all I need to do is add [breast] milk or formula."" Paula""Make batches of baby food, like steamed and mashed veggies and fruits, at one time and freeze them in meal-size quantities in small zippered bags. Defrost the bags in the fridge."" Virginia""I keep finger foods in snack-size zippered bags so I can grab a few whenever we leave the house."" MaggieTips to use at homeBath time""I've been taking showers with my daughter ever since she could hold her head up! We didn't have the bathtub option so this was a great way to save time. I don't get any alone time in showers anymore, but it's a time for us to have no distractions and just be silly."" A BabyCenter member""When my daughter was an infant, she hated bath time. I read somewhere that a mom took her kids in the shower, and I figured I'd give it a shot. But since babies are slippery I wore thin snow gloves to keep hold of her. They doubled as a rag to lather her up with soap. I was also breastfeeding then and had letdown issues. The warm water helped relax me enough for her to eat, and an added bonus is I got to take a shower too!"" A BabyCenter memberTidying up""I love to use the laundry basket to clean things up. I also use plastic bags to sort stuff right when I pick them up. For instance, I have four bags in my laundry basket: I put trash in one, kitchen stuff in another, clothes in one, and toys in another. Then I just put the bags in the respective rooms and tackle them when I get around to cleaning that room!"" A BabyCenter member""To get cleaning done while my 7-month-old son is awake, I try to make all my chores a game to involve him more, even if it just means singing my way through washing dishes. I keep a few toys in every room and bring him with me while I clean. Bringing him from room to room with me means I can keep an eye on him, and the change of scenery keeps him from getting bored. He has new places to explore, and he naps better because he wears himself out playing and not crying. Cleaning while he's awake means that while he's napping I can give myself a break too. Otherwise I'd be going nonstop and I would be exhausted by the end of the day!"" A BabyCenter member""Babyproof! And build a baby 'jail.' Mine started crawling at 6 1/2 months and walking at 9 1/2 months. I had a totally padded, babyproofed section of my living room gated off so I could go to the bathroom sometimes."" A BabyCenter member""With my first, I was told to sleep when baby sleeps.But then how do you get stuff done? You set an alarm for 20 minutes, pick one thing each time the baby is sleeping and do that for 20 minutes, then rest. It might take you all day to get just a couple of things done, but they get done and you get the rest you need."" A BabyCenter member""Use puppy pads as makeshift changing tables or use them to line not-so-clean changing tables at gas stations, public restrooms etc. I use them all the time, and they're awesome!"" A BabyCenter member""Puppy training pads! From 'airing out' to midnight diaper changes, these are amazing to protect carpets, sheets, and anything else. I used them with every diaper change while they were very young because little bums are full of surprises!"" A BabyCenter memberLaundry""Keep separate laundry bins or baskets for sorting laundry. It is easier to have a 'baby bin' for washing [clothes] with baby soap, a 'whites bin' for clothes to be washed with bleach, etc. That saves a ton of time when you do laundry."" A BabyCenter member""I never bothered with special baby detergents when washing baby clothes. We bought [regular detergent without] perfumes or dyes. I figured that would work best with my baby's sensitive skin, plus we could do our own laundry in it, so no need for separate detergents. Sure made laundry simpler!"" A BabyCenter member""Use a lingerie bag for socks, mittens, headbands, and other tiny items so they don't get lost in the wash."" A BabyCenter memberTips for heading out with your baby""I always leave a seasonally appropriate change of clothes in the trunk, with a diaper (now underwear) and socks, inside a plastic baggie, so I always have something in case of emergency. And the baggie is also so I have a place to store clothes that get puked on/pooped on/peed on/bird crapped on."" A BabyCenter member""Put a couple of diapers in your purse that you can have on you at all times. I also stash small packs of wipes in different places, so I will have them ready for dirty hands and diaper changes."" A BabyCenter member""Customer service [desks] often have wipes and diapers on hand for 'mishaps'! I didn't know this until one day at Costco I was stuck pondering [whether I should] wash my sons bottom in the bathroom sink after running out of wipes when a helpful lady ran to the customer service counter for some more. Turns out it's a service that most stores provide  super comforting to know!"" A BabyCenter memberGoing back to work""I outsource a lot. We have a cleaning person two times per month, and I order groceries for delivery. I also have simplified everything. Dinners are very basic and usually only require one pot or baking dish. I rotate through the same 10 meals. I also do all laundry on the weekend and prep all lunches and outfits. This really maximizes my time during the week and gives me more time with my little one at night."" A BabyCenter member""I take the 'do more during the week to maximize the weekend' approach. I make dinners [in the slow cooker] Tuesday through Thursday, and every meal is prepared so that we have enough leftovers for lunch the next day. I label and pack lunch the night before, and I do two loads of laundry per day. As soon as I walk through the door, I start a load. I put that in the dryer while eating dinner. I then put another load in the machine. Right before bed, I put the second load in the dryer. If it's really crazy, I can get another load done before I leave the house in the morning. Folding clothes and [cleaning] bathrooms are the only chores I do on weekends."" A BabyCenter member""I bake a crustless quiche for breakfast on Monday that lasts four mornings for me and my husband. My son eats cereal or yogurt. I pack everyone's lunch while my husband is cleaning the kitchen after dinner. I put oatmeal in the slow cooker for breakfast as well."" A BabyCenter member""I grocery shop on Fridays after work, so it doesn't bleed into the weekend. It's tough, but scheduling and staying focused helps a lot."" A BabyCenter member""If you are pumping, get the pumping schedule as close as possible to your planned pumping time at work. If you're planning to pump during your morning commute, lunch, and drive home, start to adjust to these times now. You might see some drops in production if you make a sudden change, but if you empty out every time, your body will start to respond and rebuild production for these times quickly.""  A BabyCenter member""It's so hard to go backto work at the beginning. As crazy as it sounds,I would do a couple of trial runs as if you were getting yourself and your babyout the door. It can be overwhelming at first juggling it all, and it usually takes longer than you think, especially the first few days. So get up and get yourself and your baby ready as if it was a work day. (And then you'll be all ready to start the day and do something fun!)"" A BabyCenter memberKeep it in perspectiveMy tip: Hold your baby. Take that time. Smile at this little beautiful creation that has made you fall so deeply in love. In your last breath you will never say, 'I shouldn't have held my kids that much!' It goes by fast...hold on."" A BabyCenter member""Keep a journal of the little moments or you'll forget them."" A BabyCenter member""On the sanity front, you can't do it all, and you can't do it perfectly! Learn to be okay with that."" A BabyCenter member"

BabyCenter moms share their tricks for streamlining your life:Time-savers: Cleaning""I got a toy box for the living room so we can clean up the toys quickly.""""Do one load of laundry a day. Throw clothes in the washer in the morning, then into the dryer in the evening. That way you don't end up trying to do eight loads in one day.""""I clean the house in stages throughout the week while my son is napping. I do laundry after my son goes to bed, and when my husband showers with my son in the evening I have my 'me' time in the bath, which I usually use to catch up on reading or write out grocery lists and cut coupons.""""Clorox wipes and Windex wipes help you do a fast clean easily.""""I combine trips from room to room; for example, I take the wastebasket from the nursery to the kitchen with me to empty when I take her baby bottle for washing.""""We wash all of our clothes with perfume-free detergent, rather than washing the baby's clothes separately.""""Even though it's a financial burden, I have hired a housekeeper to come in once every six weeks to do deep-down cleaning. This frees up a lot of time with the baby, and I am not always stressing about the way my house looks, nor do I always feel like I should be cleaning before I can do something fun with the baby.""""Split chores with your husband or ask a friend or relative to help. My 15-year-old brother was looking for a way to make a few bucks, so we paid him to wash floors for us. It worked out well for all of us.""""Let the dishes soak. Yes, you'll have to come back to wash them, but they wash easily. I also keep an old rag in the bathroom and a squirt bottle of cleaner mixed with water. As I 'go,' I squirt a spot on the floor and then mop it up with my feet.""""Do 'power cleaning': Take 30 minutes and get as much done in that time as you can, then move on and don't worry about it!""""Determine what's really a priority and leave the rest undone. My kids and floors are clean, but I don't remember the last time I dusted in my bedroom."" Time-savers: Cooking""We cook much simpler meals these days, fewer dishes that require concentration or recipes. I walk to the grocery store so I get my exercise and my shopping done. I find I shop more frequently as I can't fit much in the stroller, so I also get more exercise.""""I prepare dinners for the week ahead on the weekend when my husband is home playing with our son, so that all I have to do is pull something out of the freezer and pop it in the oven.""""If I'm going to take the time to make a big meal, I'll prep several things at once, and while things simmer, I fill zipper-lock bags with baby carrots, washed fruit, and so on. That way there's at least one healthy meal in the fridge on any given night, and when it's time to make lunches, I can grab things easily.""""Freeze pureed baby food in ice cube trays, so all you have to do is pull out a cube or two, put them in the microwave, and you're done!""Time-savers: Baby care""Have the diaper bag prepacked. I premeasure enough formula for a bottle and put it into small airtight containers and keep them in the bag. My baby has special 'going out' toys that stay in the diaper bag and she only plays with them when we go out (which reduces her fussiness while we're out  she's enthralled with her special toys). If everything you need is already packed, you don't have to find the time to pack it while you are rushing to get yourself and your baby ready to go.""""Bring extra sets of clothes when you go out. That way you don't have to go home when the baby has pooped all over his outfit.""""Involve the baby in any activities that need to be done, whether it's cleaning, showering, cooking, or whatever. Don't feel like you need to always entertain the baby. Let her learn how to be involved in everyday activities.""""Make up a day's worth of formula in a pitcher, and then you don't have to waste time making each individual bottle.""""We keep a stocked diaper station in our family room, where we spend most of our time. It has everything we could ever need right at our fingertips.""""Keeping your baby naked except for a diaper during feeding time makes for a quicker cleanup.""""I have two children under the age of 2. I put them on the same nap schedule so I can shower, mop the floors, or do a chore I can't do when they are awake  and I always save at least 20 minutes for 'me' time.""""We do not warm her formula  she has been bottle-fed from the beginning and doesn't know about warm food. Besides, we live in Florida. Who wants warm milk? Blech.""""If possible, try to bathe kids together. You save on water and time, and they enjoy their time in the tub together.""""Let the baby's father do things with the baby, like give him a bath or feed him. Don't stand over the father and say, 'Do it this way.' Let the father ask for advice if he wants it. The sooner you let the father jump in and do things himself, in the way he prefers to do it, the more time you will have saved! At first it may seem like it takes more time to let the father do things, but in a few short days or weeks, he'll be doing it just as quickly as you do.""""Let the baby join in. For example, if you're cooking, just give him a pot or pan and let him pretend he's cooking too.""""Save the baby's favorite toys for when you need the extra time, so she can keep busy while you do your work.""""Use links or rings to attach toys to the swing, car seat, stroller, and so on, so you don't have to pick them up from floor and disinfect them every time they fall.""""Dress the baby in easy-access clothing instead of cutesy but more complicated outfits that make diaper and clothing changes difficult.""""A big time-saver for me was making all my baby bottles a week in advance. I use the 'preformed, standable' liners. I fill them for the whole week, then store them in the door of the freezer. I grab what I need before we leave for daycare, drop them in the plastic bottles, and go.""""My husband and I keep a car seat in each of our vehicles so that we don't have to take the time to switch the seat from one car to the other when we ride together.""""I have a couple bins in the hall closet, one for day trips and one for overnight. I keep diapers, a few toys, travel wipes, some jars of baby food and a zipper-lock bag of cereal, some fruit cups and a couple of juice boxes, pajamas, crayons, blocks, tissues, hand sanitizer, sunscreen, and whatever else I might need in them. The only thing I don't pack in the bin is bottles and whatever clothes I want them to wear the next day, because it depends on where you are going, weather, dress code, and so forth. It's great to keep toys in the bin  when we go to someone's house, it's like the kids have all-new toys, and it keeps them busy for longer. When I come home, I restock the bins. You usually have more time after the trip than before, when you are trying to rush out the door."" Time-savers: Beauty routine""Sometimes you won't have time to do your hair, put on makeup, or even shower. That's OK. Learn quick hairdos you can use in a pinch and how to apply minimal amounts of makeup and still feel presentable. I've found that having a happy, well-cared-for baby on your hip can make any mom look good enough to show her face anywhere!""""Having clothing that is not fiddly helps. Avoid buttons, snaps, and zippers, and go for elastic waistbands and pullover shirts.""""I wake up before her normal time to get ready. If I try to get ready when she's up, it takes me twice as long.""""Pair outfits and put them in a drawer. When you're in a hurry, pull the outfit out, dress, and go.""""Get a haircut that looks good but is easy to take care of. Pay a little extra for it if you have to. I used to spend 30 minutes a day on my hair. I told my hairdresser that I needed an easier cut, and now I spend two minutes a day on my hair.""Time-savers: Errands""I keep a soft-sided cooler in my trunk and do my grocery shopping on my lunch hour.""""Shop on the Internet when possible to avoid making trips out.""""I make sure that I do multiple errands on the same side of town, and I take advantage of drive-up options whenever possible (drive-through banking, for example).""""Shopping at a store that has everything you'll need (such as a discount store with a full grocery section), if there's one near you, is a great time-saver.""""I plan everything so that I don't backtrack during the day. Backtracking takes up valuable time and wears the kids out (and me too). And I plan my day around their nap times  very important because then I don't have to deal with whiny, tired children, which causes even more stress and wasted time.""Time-savers: Work""My hospital-grade breast pump has been a savior. It gets the job done quickly and effectively.""""Skip lunches and go in to work and leave an hour early to beat the traffic.""""Take care of stuff like paying bills on your commute if you take public transport."" Time-savers: General""I have bought many different types of home organizers  drawer inserts, over-the-door shelves, baskets. The most important thing is knowing right where to find what you need while carrying a squirming child.""""Accept that you won't be able to do things as quickly as you like, so you don't get so uptight and things flow more smoothly. The more you hurry, the more hassled your child gets and the more time things take.""""I try to anticipate my baby's fussy periods of the day and keep him on a regular schedule so that I can build my schedule around him. If I know he is typically happy at a certain time of day, I use that time to multitask and do chores while singing and talking to him.""""Rest when the baby rests. It may seem like a waste of time, but you will accomplish more when you are not exhausted.""""I recommend reevaluating your relationships with other people; if you have some 'friends' who really aren't friends, now's the time to limit  or eliminate  the time you spend with them.""""Use a family calendar and post it where all can see. File bills in one expandable file by due date and check it on a daily or weekly basis.""""Don't get stuck surfing the Net.

Introducing solids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_introducing-solids_113.bc,"When should I introduce solid food to my baby?As long as your baby shows signs of readiness, your child's doctor may say you can start solids any time around 4 to 6 months. Until then, breast milk or formula provides all the calories and nourishment your baby needs  and can handle. Infants don't yet have the physical skills to swallow solid foods safely, and their digestive system simply isn't ready for solids until they're about 4 months old.(Note that there's some controversy on this topic.While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) section on breastfeeding recommends that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first six months, the AAP's nutrition section and guidelines for pediatricians recommend starting solids at 4 to 6 months.)How can I tell when my baby's ready for solid food?Your baby will give you clear signs when he's ready to move beyond a liquid diet. Cues to look for include:Head control. Your baby needs to be able to keep his head in a steady, upright position.Sitting well when supported. Your baby needs to be able to sit upright in an infant feeding seat or highchair to swallow well.Losing the ""extrusion reflex."" Your baby's mouth and tongue develop in sync with his digestive system. To start solids, he should be able to move food to the back of his mouth and swallow it, instead of using his tongue to push food out of his mouth.Significant weight gain. He may be ready to eat solids if he's doubled his birth weight, weighs at least 13 pounds, and is at least 4 months old.Curiosity about food. Your baby may begin eyeing or reaching for your food or may open his mouth if you offer him a spoonful.7 signs your baby is ready for solid foods Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:57Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:57Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Watch for these signs that usually indicate when babies are ready to try their first food. See all videosWhich solid foods should I feed my baby first?Each baby is different, so talk to your child's doctor about which solids to introduce and when. Most infants can start with any pureed single-ingredient food with no added salt or sugar. Although it's customary in many American families to start babies on infant cereal, there's no medical evidence showing that this offers any advantages or health benefits.If your baby is breastfed, the AAP suggests meat as a first food because the iron in beef, chicken, and turkey helps to replace her iron stores, which start to diminish at about 6 months of age. Other good first foods include pureed sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, bananas, peaches, and pears.What can I do to minimize the risk of food allergies?Traditional first foods, such as iron-fortified infant cereal, pureed veggies, fruits, and meats, don't typically cause allergic reactions, but observe your baby for signs of allergy, just in case.Once you've tried a few of these foods and your baby seems to be tolerating them well, you can introduce more allergenic foods, such as soy, eggs, wheat, fish, and peanut butter. According to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI), introducing allergenic foods around 4 to 6 months may actually help prevent the development of food allergies later on.Special precautions need to be taken with certain babies. If your child falls into any of the following categories, consult with your baby's doctor or an allergist to create a customized feeding plan before adding solids to your baby's diet:Your baby has a sibling with a peanut allergy.Your baby has moderate to severe eczema despite following a doctor's treatment plan.Your baby previously had an immediate allergic reaction to a new food or has been diagnosed with a food allergy.Your baby's blood test was positive for an allergy to a specific food.Guide to Firsts: Solid foodOur checklist helps you get ready to feed your baby.How should I introduce solid food to my baby?For your first few feedings, give him just 1 or 2 teaspoons of pureed solid food or infant cereal after nursing or bottle-feeding.Use a soft-tipped plastic spoon to feed your baby to avoid injuring his gums. Put a small amount of food on the tip of the spoon and offer it to him. If your baby doesn't seem very interested, just let him smell the food for now and try again another time.If you're feeding your baby ready-to-eat jars or pouches of baby food, put some into a small dish and feed him from that. (If you dip his feeding spoon into the jar, it's not a good idea to save the leftovers because bacteria from his mouth will now be in the jar.) Throw away any open baby food jars within a day or two of opening them.If you decide to start with cereal, give him 1 to 2 teaspoons of diluted infant cereal. Add breast milk or formula to a tiny pinch of cereal. It will be very runny at first, but as your baby starts to eat more solid foods, you can gradually thicken the consistency by using less liquid.How to introduce new foods to your baby Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:51Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:51Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosBegin with one daily feeding whenever your baby is not too tired, hungry, or cranky). Your baby may not eat much at first, but give him time to get used to the experience. Some babies need practice keeping food in their mouths and swallowing.Eventually you can start giving him more solid food until he's up to a few tablespoons a day, over two feedings.(Note that most parents start solids by spoon-feeding their baby infant cereal or purees. But some parents use an alternative technique known as baby-led weaning, in which you put large chunks of soft food directly on the highchair tray or table, and let your baby grasp the food and feed himself. See our article on baby-led weaning for guidelines on how this technique works.)See our age-by-age baby feeding guide to find out what you can expect next.How do I introduce each new food to my baby?Introduce solids gradually, one at a time. Offer your baby a new food a few times over the course of three to five days before trying another new food. This way you'll be able to tell if your baby has an allergic reaction to something.Although you want your baby to eat a wide variety of foods, it takes time for her to get used to each new taste and texture. And each baby will have individual food preferences, but in general, your baby could start the transition with pureed or semi-liquid food, then move on to strained or mashed food, and finally graduate to small pieces of finger foods.If your baby is moving on from cereal, offer a few tablespoons of vegetables or fruit in the same meal as a cereal feeding (or mix them together). All food should be very mushy  at this stage your baby will press the food against the top of her mouth before swallowing it.What are the signs of a food allergy?If your baby is allergic to a new food, you'll see signs of a reaction within a few minutes or hours. Most children with food allergies have mild reactions. If you notice hives, vomiting, or diarrhea, call your baby's doctor for advice.If you notice wheezing, difficulty breathing, or facial swelling (including the tongue and lips), your baby may be having a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.How can I tell when my baby is full?Your baby's appetite will vary from one feeding to the next, so a strict accounting of how much he's eaten isn't a reliable way to tell when he's had enough. Look for these signs that he's probably done:Leans back in his chairTurns his head away from foodStarts playing with the spoonRefuses to open up for the next bite (Sometimes a baby will keep his mouth closed because he hasn't yet finished with the first mouthful, so give him time to swallow.)Do I still need to give my baby breast milk or formula?Yes, breast milk or formula will still provide the majority of your baby's calories and nutrition until she's a year old. Both provide important vitamins, iron, and protein in a form that's easy to digest. Solid food can't replace the nutrients that breast milk or formula provides during that first year.See how much breast milk or formula babies need after starting solids.Solid food feeding tipsOffer sweets or savories in any order. Some parents may tell you to start with vegetables instead of fruits so your infant won't develop a taste for sweets. But babies are born with a preference for sweets, so you don't have to worry about introducing sweet or savory foods in any particular order.Feed cereal with a spoon only. Unless your baby's doctor asks you to, don't add cereal to his bottle  he could choke or end up gaining too much weight.Encourage adventurous eating. Don't leave any food off his menu simply because you don't like it.Give new foods time. If your baby turns away from a particular food, don't push. Try again in a week or so. He may never like sweet potatoes, or he may change his mind and end up loving them.Know the choking hazards. Don't give your baby foods that might make him choke.Watch for constipation. A baby's stool sometimes changes when his diet does. Although it's usually temporary, your baby may have constipation after introducing solids. If you notice that your baby is having less frequent bowel movements, or that his stools have become hard or dry and seem difficult to pass, let his doctor know. Some doctors recommend adding high-fiber fruits such as pears, prunes, and peaches to a baby's diet, or giving him a few ounces of prune, apple, or pear juice each day until his bowel movements are back to normal.Also, don't be surprised if your baby's stools change color and odor when you add solids to his diet. If your baby has been exclusively breastfed up to this point, you'll probably notice a strong odor to his formerly mild-smelling stools as soon as he starts eating even tiny amounts of solids. This is normal.How many times a day should my baby eat solid food?At first she'll eat solid food just once a day. By around 6 to 7 months, two meals a day is the norm. Starting around 8 to 9 months, she may be eating solid food three times a day. A typical day's diet at 8 months might include a combination of:Breast milk or iron-fortified formulaIron-fortified cerealVegetablesFruitSmall amounts of protein, such as eggs, cheese, yogurt, poultry, lentils, tofu, and meatThere are certain foods that you shouldn't give your baby yet. Honey, for example, can cause botulism in babies less than a year old. And babies should wait until after their first birthday to try cow's milk or soy milk.What equipment do I need to feed solids to my baby?It's helpful to have:A highchairPlastic dishes and bowlsPlastic spoons to protect your baby's sensitive gumsBibsA splat mat on the floorYou may also want to introduce your baby to a sippy cup soon after you start solids.What do I need to make homemade baby food?If you're making your own baby food, you'll need:A tool to puree the food, like a blender, food processor, or baby food grinderStorage containers for refrigerating and freezing extra portions (Some parents use ice cube trays  or similar devices made just for baby food  to store and freeze individual portions.)Where should I feed solids to my baby?You'll want a sturdy, stable, comfy place for him to sit, at a convenient height for you. To start out, that might be a bouncy seat or even a car seat. (Just make sure that he's upright enough to swallow well.)However, once he can sit up by himself, a highchair at the table is your best bet. That way, your baby can be a part of family meals, and you'll be able to eat and feed him at the same time. It's also easier to clean up after he chows down.How can I help my child develop healthy eating habits?Don't feel like you have to stick to bland, boring baby foods  get ideas for more adventurous options to give your child, or learn how to make your own baby food.See our new rules for feeding your baby and the old guidelines that still apply.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012.

How can I prepare my child for going on a family vacation? (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/404_how-can-i-prepare-my-child-for-going-on-a-family-vacation-ag_71419.bc,
How to talk to your child about a layoff,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-talk-to-your-child-about-a-layoff_10310613.bc,"How to break the newsDon't put it off. As soon as you have a sense of how the layoff will affect your family, talk to your child. ""It's dangerous for parents to assume that kids aren't paying attention,"" says Judith Myers-Walls, a professor of child development and family studies at Purdue University.School-age kids will pick up on a shift in routine  if you start packing lunch instead of sending lunch money, for example, or if Dad is still in his pajamas after breakfast. They could also hear rumors from somewhere else. Don't let your child overhear the news; talk to him promptly instead.Assume your child will blab. Decide what you're okay with neighbors and people at school knowing about the layoff. Then share details accordingly: ""Mom isn't going to work for a while, but she's looking for a new job."" Maybe not: ""We're borrowing money from Grandma and Grandpa to pay the rent.""Keep the economic seminar very brief. ""You can't expect a grade-schooler to understand why one company is closing and another one isn't,"" notes Myers-Walls. So keep it simple: ""Mom's company doesn't have enough money to pay her anymore, so she's going to look for a new job.""Focus on how things will change for your child... ""Share the reality in terms of what's obvious to your child,"" says Stanley Greenspan, coauthor of The Secure Child: Helping Our Children Feel Safe and Confident in a Changing World. And emphasize the positive: ""I'm going to be home more while I'm looking for a job, so I'll be able to pick you up from school and come on field trips.""Five- to 8-year-olds will be most concerned about how a layoff will affect their daily lives: Will they go to the same school, play on their soccer team, have the birthday party they've been counting on? If there's going to be a major change to your child's routine, that's what he needs to know.Reassure him that while there may be some changes for a while and he may not have everything he's used to, you have a plan and everything will be all right.and on what's not going to change. Even a small change in routine can be unsettling to a child. So, after you break the news, list some of the things that won't change, like that you'll stay in the same house and that you'll be visiting Grandma and Grandpa as planned.Be clear that it's not your child's fault. It doesn't occur to us that children would blame themselves, but a school-age kid might think, ""If I had behaved better, maybe Mom or Dad would have a job,"" notes Myers-Walls. Specifically tell your child this has nothing to do with him  sometimes layoffs just happen.Spare the gory details. Your grade-schooler doesn't need to hear about how upper management drove your company into the ground. He also should be shielded from your deepest concerns over paying the bills. ""You don't want to take away a sense of security,"" says Myers-Walls.To calm your child, put a positive spin on the situation: ""Daddy isn't going to work for a while, but I have a list of ten places I'm going to call about a job for me today.""Don't make promises you can't keep. You might be tempted to say that you will be getting a new job soon or ""in a month"" or that your child can resume dance lessons ""in the summer."" But if it takes longer, your child might feel betrayed, says Myers-Walls. It's better to admit that you just don't know but you'll do your best to get things back to normal.Expect comparisons. Your 7- or 8-year-old might get sulky or angry and say, ""Aidan's dad didn't lose his job."" Try not to get defensive. Respond with something like, ""I'm very happy Aidan's dad still has his job. I know you're upset. It's hard for all of us. But this is happening to a lot of people, and just like all those people, we need to make a new plan. Everything will be all right.""Listen. Give your child a chance to ask questions. You'll get a good sense of what he's absorbed and what you might need to clarify. You'll also find out what, if anything, is worrying him so you can reassure him. ""You help your child cope by being a good empathetic listener,"" says Greenspan. Answers to common questions about a job loss""What does 'laid off' mean?"" Even if you didn't use this term with your child, he might have overheard you talking or heard something on the news. An age-appropriate answer is, ""That's when someone who pays people to do jobs can't pay anymore and those people have to go find new jobs.""""Did Dad do something wrong?"" Your grade-schooler might be curious about whose fault it is. You can say something along the lines of, ""No, Dad didn't do anything wrong. It's just that people aren't buying very many cars right now, so Dad is looking for a different job."" Or more generally, ""Lots of people are having to find new jobs these days.""""Why can't we keep our cable?"" Your child may not gracefully accept it if he has to give up a luxury he's used to. He may be especially confused or upset if a friend or neighbor isn't having to deal with similar cutbacks. Empathize with your child's disappointment. ""I'm sorry. I wish we could, but we can't right now."" Follow up by pointing out the things he gets to keep, like bikes, books, and DVDs.""Can we still go to Disneyland?"" If the trip is off, say, ""Not this year, but we can go see Grandma and Grandpa and go boating on the lake."" Reassure your child that his basic needs  food, shelter  will always be met. You can't expect him to handle every disappointment in an adult way, says Myers-Walls. If he gets upset, accept that it might be the inevitable result of the stress on the family. A hug and an empathetic ear go a long way.Next stepsMake up for what's lost. Think of ways to soften the blow of major cutbacks. ""It's better to replace something than just take it away,"" says Myers-Walls. To substitute for a weekly dinner out you can't afford right now, make that night's at-home meal special by letting the kids decide the menu and using a tablecloth, candles, and fun napkins. If swim lessons are out, go as a family to the community pool.Give your child a chance to help. Your child may have an idea, like a bake sale or sidewalk sale. While this probably won't make a huge difference in the family finances, it will help your kid feel more in control and like he's part of the team. Say, ""That's a great idea. Let's figure out how to do that together.""Make room for extra quality time. Make sure that between looking at job listings, you get some extra time with your child. ""That establishes more security,"" says Greenspan. Go to the park after school or offer to play a favorite board game after dinner. Any worries or questions your child has may come out during this quiet time together.Find another outlet for your stress. Be careful not to dump your anxiety on your child  turn to a friend or your partner to talk about it. When you feel like you may not be able to check your emotions or stay positive around your kids, ask Grandma or a babysitter to help out. Keep your expectations of your child reasonable. A layoff will be stressful for your child, especially if a parent remains unemployed for a while. Your child may seek extra attention from you, or even regress a bit or misbehave during this time. While you might like to think your child will be helpful and understanding, he may not be.If he gets mad about what he can no longer have, acknowledge his feelings. ""You're really upset, aren't you?"" Sometimes being heard is all a child needs."

How to talk to your child about poverty and homelessness (ages 5-8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-talk-to-your-child-about-poverty-and-homelessness-age_3657085.bc,"What your grade-schooler knows  and needs to knowFive- to 8-year-olds are transitioning from being me-centered to seeing themselves as part of a group. ""So it's a good time developmentally to talk about hunger and poverty,"" says Susan Linn, a child psychologist at Harvard Medical School. They're also becoming interested in doing something about the problems they see.School-age kids will have lots of questions: ""How long will that person live there? Does he have kids?"" What your child needs is guidance from you about how to think about the issue. It's key to sort through your own attitudes before bringing it up. Think about how you want your child to respond to the homeless  and how to explain it in a way that makes sense. Some parents want their children to be cautious around panhandlers; others encourage their kids to be friendly and show compassion.How to begin talking about poverty and homelessnessSettle on your message. When you encounter a panhandler, are you concerned about the person's well-being  or are you annoyed to be hassled? ""Sometimes parents communicate values they don't really intend to, but they do it unconsciously,"" says Judith Myers-Walls, associate professor in child development and family studies at Purdue University. If you never say anything about the people sleeping on the street you walk along every day, you may send the message that it's not okay to bring it up or that you're indifferent.When your child grows curious, that's your cue to work through your thoughts so you can communicate a clear message. What are your rules about how friendly or cautious you want your child to be?Bring the topic up naturally. If you come across a homeless person or see a report about poverty on TV, ask your child what she thinks the word poor or homeless means. A field trip to a big city or a friendship with a kid at school whose family has a low income might spark a conversation that gives you a chance to clear up any misconceptions.When Leyla Perkins and her family had to evacuate New Orleans before Hurricane Katrina hit, it forced a conversation with her then-5- and 2-year-old children. ""When we watched the news, our 5-year-old wanted to know why everyone hadn't just left like we did,"" Perkins recalls. ""We told her that not everyone has enough money to buy a car, and without our car, we couldn't have evacuated."" That led to further talks about money, jobs, and education. ""We try to help our kids understand that they're luckier than most,"" says Perkins.Encourage empathy. Start by saying something like ""I think it's sad that person doesn't have anywhere to live."" Ask your child to help you gather household items to give to charity or plan a trip to volunteer at a food pantry. ""Help kids think about what people might be feeling rather than just treating them as an object to be talked about,"" says Myers-Walls. If you hear your child  or any kid in her social circle  making fun of a homeless person, be clear that disrespect is not okay.Explain your actions  or your inaction. Whether you habitually offer money or food to homeless people or avoid doing so, let your child in on why. You might say something like ""I'll buy them a sandwich but I won't give them money, because sometimes people don't spend money in ways that will help them. This way I know it's going to help."" Or you could say, ""No I don't give money to people on the street, but I give money to programs that will help them.""Help kids take action. ""Kids this age take things very personally,"" adds Myers-Walls, associate professor in child development and family studies at Purdue University. ""When they meet a person, they want to help."" Sometimes a child will take this to extremes, like wanting to bring someone home to live with you. ""It may help to redirect that energy,"" says Myers-Walls. Look into donating to local soup kitchens or thrift shops. Collecting items to be used by someone else is very tangible for kids. A post-birthday or pre-Christmas toy purge teaches your child to share what she has with others.Susan Linn, a psychologist at the Judge Baker Children's Center at Harvard Medical School, established an annual ritual with her daughter of shopping for an entire Thanksgiving meal and taking it to a food pantry. Building this tradition around a holiday spurs them to do it each year. ""It's also a good way to help children understand that there's more to Thanksgiving than your family sitting down to an enormous meal,"" Linn notes. To explain it to her young daughter, Linn would say, ""We're so lucky that we're going to have this wonderful party; let's bring food to a family that isn't as lucky.""For her daughter's sixth birthday, Suzanne Lane of Piedmont, California, organized a nontraditional party where the guests assembled Project Night Night goody bags of stuffed animals and other items for homeless children. Then she and her daughter dropped the bags off at a local shelter. ""Casey enjoyed going to the shelter so much that she wanted to deliver more bags at Christmastime,"" says Lane. Answers to common questions about poverty and homelessness""Why doesn't he have a place to live?"" A school-age child will not only want to know the ""whats"" but the ""whys."" Be direct and say something like ""That's a good question. I don't know for sure. Sometimes it's because a person doesn't have the money to pay for a house or an apartment."" A 5- to 8-year-old is ready to handle an answer that includes issues such as a mental illness or disability.""What if we lose our house?"" Reassure your child: ""We have a home. If we ever lost our home, here's what we would do..."" Explain that you could move in with a relative, find an apartment, or go to a temporary shelter.""Why won't you help that man?"" Your child might wonder why you refuse to give change to a panhandler, especially if you talk about how it's good to give to others. Linn suggests responding with something like ""I'm concerned about just giving this person cash, so I'm going to write a check to a homeless shelter that helps people like this.""""Why is he acting like that?"" If you come across a homeless person acting in a bizarre way, you can explain that mental illness or alcoholism could be the culprit. Myers-Walls suggests an answer along these lines: ""Some illnesses are like a cold or the flu. Your body gets sick, then you get better and feel good again. There are other kinds of illnesses that affect the way a person thinks or acts. And some illnesses make people want drugs or alcohol."" Then tell your child that there are people with special training who can sometimes help those people.What else you can doUse books to inspire action. The Kids Guide to Service Projects: Over 500 Service Ideas for Young People Who Want to Make a Difference describes in simple terms examples and strategies for projects that help the homeless and alleviate hunger.Find out what's happening at school. Your child's school might involve students in collecting food or blankets, offering you an opening to discuss the issue and work with your child to get involved.Make a difference, together. Since your grade-schooler's awareness of the wider world is growing, check out global organizations like Unicef or Church World Services for info on how to participate in a Hunger Walk  which often include children volunteers  or host a Tools & Blankets celebration to benefit struggling families."
What to pack for the hospital when you're having a c-section,https://www.babycenter.com/0_what-to-pack-for-the-hospital-when-youre-having-a-c-section_10316463.bc,"You're likely to be in the hospital for two to four days after a c-section. Use our list to make sure you have everything you need for your stay  and be sure to check out the suggestions below from BabyCenter moms who've been through it.We recommend making sure you have things ready to go when you're eight months pregnant. Remember: Your body doesn't know you have a c-section scheduled. You could go into labor at any time in the weeks before your scheduled date.For youA picture ID (driver's license or other ID), your insurance card, and any hospital paperwork you needA list of people to call and their phone numbers, your phone and chargerAfter your baby's born, you or your partner may want to call family and friends to let them know the good news. Make a list of people you'll want to contact so you don't forget someone important when you're exhausted after delivery.ToiletriesPack a few personal items, such as a toothbrush and toothpaste, lip balm, deodorant, a brush and comb, makeup, and a hair band or barrettes. Hospitals usually provide soap, shampoo, and lotion, but you might prefer your own.Eyeglasses, if you wear themEven if you usually wear contacts, you may not want to deal with them while you're in the hospital.A bathrobe, a nightgown or two, slippers, and a few pairs of socksHospitals provide gowns and socks for you to use during your stay, but most will allow you to wear your own clothes if you prefer. Choose something loose and comfortable that you don't mind getting dirty. Your own slippers and robe come in handy once you're up and walking around.Comfortable nursing bras or supportive regular brasWhether or not you choose to breastfeed, your breasts are likely to be tender and swollen when your milk comes in, which can happen anytime during the first several days after delivery. A good bra can provide some comfort, and breast pads can be added to help absorb leaks.Several pairs of maternity underpantsSome women love the mesh underwear usually provided by the hospital, but others don't. You can't go wrong with your own roomy cotton underpants. Make sure the waistband is loose enough that it won't press on your abdomen at all. The hospital will provide sanitary pads, which you'll need because even after a c-section, you'll bleed after delivery. Make sure you have a supply of heavy-duty pads waiting at home! Inside pregnancy: Labor and birthContractions begin and the cervix gradually opens. See the stages of labor and watch a baby being born.SnacksDepending on your situation, you may be able to begin eating small, light meals relatively soon after surgery. While bland hospital food is good for those early meals, eventually your appetite will come back and you'll be glad to have some snacks around  like fresh fruit or whatever you think you might enjoy. A bottle of nonalcoholic champagne might be fun for celebrating, too.A book on newborn careThe hospital will probably provide you with a book, but you may prefer your own. Of course, the postpartum nurses will be there to answer questions and show you how to change, hold, nurse, and bathe your newborn if you need guidance.Whatever will help you relax and feel comfortableHere are some possibilities: your own pillow (use a patterned or colorful pillowcase so it doesn't get mixed up with the hospital's pillows), music and something to play it on, light reading material, and a sleep mask to help you nap during the day.Photos of your other childrenWhen they come to visit, they'll see that you haven't forgotten them.Gifts for older siblingsSome parents bring gifts for the new baby to ""give"" to big brothers and sisters.A notepad or journal and pen or pencilTrack your baby's feeding sessions, write down questions you have for the nurse, note what the pediatrician tells you, jot down memories of your baby's first few days, and so on. Some people bring a baby book so they can record the birth details right away.A going-home outfitBring something roomy and easy to get into (believe it or not, you'll probably still look 5 or 6 months pregnant) and a pair of flat, comfortable shoes. If you're going to wear pants, make sure the waistband is loose and won't press on your incision.For your partnerA camera or video camera with batteries, charger, and memory cardToiletriesComfortable shoes and a few changes of comfortable clothesSnacks and something to readMoney for parking and change for vending machinesFor your babyAn installed car seatYou can't drive your baby home without one! Have the seat properly installed ahead of time and know how to buckle your baby in correctly.Baby clothes for the hospital stayThe hospital will provide diapers and some sort of clothing, such as a pair of pajamas or a sleep shirt. You can bring baby clothes of your own if you like. One-piece stretchy outfits that snap or zip up the front are easiest for diaper changes.A going-home outfitYour baby will need an outfit to go home in, including socks or booties if the clothing doesn't have feet, and a soft cap if the air is likely to be cool. Make sure the legs on your baby's clothes are separate so the car seat strap can fit between them.A receiving blanketThe hospital will provide blankets for swaddling your baby while you're there, but you may want to bring your own to tuck around your baby in the car seat for the ride home. Make it a heavy one if the weather's cold.What not to bringJewelryLots of cash or other valuablesMedications, including vitamins.Let your doctor know whether you're on any medications. The hospital will provide them for you if your doctor agrees that you should continue to take them while you're there.Diapers.The hospital will provide diapers for your baby while you're there. Leave your supply at home.A breast pump. If you end up needing a breast pump for any reason, the hospital can provide one.Tips from moms who've been there""Bring snacks like granola bars, prunes, or anything with fiber, because you'll be hungry afterward. In fact, eat as much high-fiber, low-fat food as you can for about three or four days before your c-section. Having your first bowel movement is very painful, and this helps ease the pain.""  samnroxy04""Bring music, books, or anything that makes you relax. There's a lot of pain involved with the recovery and you'll appreciate having something to take your mind off it.""  isaiahnoelle""Bring cheap throwaway flip-flops to wear into the bathroom and shower. The hospital floors were icky.""  kaym12""GRANNY PANTIES. You sure don't want bikini underwear rubbing the incision. Next time I might bring absorbent disposable underwear for the first few days to deal with all the bleeding.""  kkckkc""Sanitary pads! No one ever wants to tell you this, but the hospital gives you giant 1950s pads for the bleeding. Just take one pack of thick, long pads.""  pppjones""I used the hospital's undies, sanitary pads, and socks. I also didn't bother with my own nightgown or robe. (I just put a second hospital gown on backward.) Like most women, I bled a lot and I didn't want to mess up my own undies, nightgown, etc. I saved those for when I went home.""  Abigail""I bought a pair of nursing pajamas to wear in the hospital but never did. The gown was a lot more comfortable and after a c-section, I didn't want to move around too much.""  AManfred""My sister-in-law gave me these silk capri pj's with a drawstring in front. She cut a U shape out of the very front so it wouldn't rub. I felt divine in my cozy pj's and I wore them for weeks afterward. Also bring some perfume, makeup, body wash  whatever you use to feel pretty. After all you go through, you don't feel too pretty.""  lollimom""One thing that I didn't realize I would need was nipple cream. I found breastfeeding hard to get used to and had to get someone to buy this stuff for me because my nipples got chapped!""  Portsie""Take a nursing pillow to support your baby during breastfeeding because it does hurt having a baby on top of your incision.""  tendime""Bring baby nail clippers or an emery board. The hospital where my son was born didn't supply clippers for fear of liability, and as a result my son gouged his face before he was 12 hours old.""  Jen""I've had a c-section and a vaginal delivery, and the only thing I wish I had taken to the hospital for the c-section was a long dress to come home in. I took some loose pants, but it's still a little painful, no matter how loose the elastic is.""  july8416""I packed my maternity clothes to come home in. I thought after having my baby that the clothes would fit loosely enough to be comfortable. Boy, was I wrong. Bring a loose dress or even plan to wear your nightgown home from the hospital. NO PANTS.""  Anonymous""Overalls have worked great for me to wear home. I've had four scheduled c-sections.""  Kelli1714""Order and have somebody else pick up your pain meds before you leave the hospital. I made the mistake of waiting until we left the hospital and didn't think that I would make it! My husband and I won't make this mistake again.""  kaym12Show sources Hide sources Lamaze International. 2014.

Baby food revolution: New rules for feeding your baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-food-revolution-new-rules-for-feeding-your-baby_10320504.bc,"Many babies areready for solid foodsby the time they're 4 to 6 months old, and parents often turn to such traditional first foods as infant cereals and otherbland fare. Plain food isn't necessarily bad for babies, but too much of it can deprive them of important nutrients and may make them less likely to accept different textures and flavors.So how do you get your baby to eat a variety of food from an early age? Here's the exciting new thinking on what to feed your baby.Rethink what you've heard about food allergiesExperts used to recommend waiting to introducecommonly allergenic foods, including eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, and shellfish, until after your baby's first birthday. But recent research suggests that introducing them when your baby is between 4 and 6 months old may actually help prevent food allergies.If your baby is at least 4 months old and shows signs of readiness for solids, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology recommends starting with a few nonallergenic foods  such as pureed veggies, fruits, meats, or infant cereal  to see if they cause any reactions. If they don't, you can move on to more allergenic foods, such as eggs and fish. Be sure to wait three to five days before introducing the next new food.7 signs your baby is ready for solid foods Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:57Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:57Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Watch for these signs that usually indicate when babies are ready to try their first food. See all videosYou may also need to take extra precautions in some situations. If your baby has a sibling or a parent with an allergic condition (including hay fever, eczema, allergic asthma, or food allergy), he's more likely to have a food allergy. In this case, consult with your baby's doctor or an allergist before starting solids.Also check with the doctor before starting solids or introducing new foods if your baby has any of these risk factors:A sibling with a peanut allergyModerate to severe eczema despite following a doctor's treatment planA diagnosed food allergy or a previous immediate allergic reaction to a foodA positive result on an allergy blood test for a food that your baby has not yet tried (Blood tests for food allergies are usually done only for children with a history of an allergic reaction.)Read our article on food allergies to find out more.No need to avoid spices and seasoningsWhile babies throughout the world are dining on complex, flavorful cuisine, many babies in the United States are gumming plain, tasteless mush. The reasons we continue to serve babies bland food are open to debate, but one thing is certain  they're not based on research.""The idea that babies should eat only bland food is a myth that has somehow become our cultural norm,"" says Seattle pediatrician Susanna Block. ""There's absolutely no science behind it.""In other words, a culinary walk on the wild side won't hurt your baby in the slightest.5 tips to develop healthy eating habits Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:05Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:05Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosAnd breastfed babies have actually walked that way already: Breast milk takes on the flavors of the food the mother eats, Block explains. So if you dine at your favorite Indian restaurant and then nurse, your baby will also enjoy the taste of an Indian meal. ""To go from diverse, flavorful breast milk to bland, processed foods seems like a step backward,"" she says.So toss some rosemary in with that squash, liven up that chicken with a dash of cumin, and give those mashed potatoes a kick with a blend of paprika and parsley. You may be surprised by your baby's reaction.Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to banish hot spices from the highchair tray either. ""I know of no evidence that spicy food has a negative impact on babies. The degree of spiciness is a cultural thing,"" says pediatrician Frank Greer of the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Of course you'll want to steer clear of anything that could irritate your baby's skin or mouth (so no habaneros yet), but there's no harm in letting your baby try mildly or moderately spicy food. For example, milder chiles, such as Anaheims and poblanos, add flavor without causing pain. If anyone raises an eyebrow, just say that babies in other parts of the world thrive on spicy food.""Spicy chickpea curry with lots of ginger was one of my son's favorite finger foods,"" says Jennifer Pinarski of Winnipeg, Manitoba.Cooking with herbs and spices is a great way to expand your baby's palate, but skip the sugar and salt when preparing food for your little one. Not only are they unhealthy for her, but they can also lead to poor eating habits and health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease in childhood and later in life.Give your little one homemade food for babies and for grown-ups""Homemade baby food"" sounds daunting, but it's surprisingly easy and doesn't require a nutrition degree, gourmet cooking skills, or fancy equipment. Making baby food can be as simple as mashing up a banana or avocado with a fork, squashing canned beans together with some garlic, or pureeing veggies steamed with spices.And as long as you're making something healthy, your baby can eat the same food you do  no need to make separate meals! Just use a blender, food processor, or hand grinder to make food the right consistency for your baby.Make your own informed decisions about organics""There's a lot of confusion when it comes to organics because there's no conclusive evidence that they're healthier than conventional foods,"" says dietitian and mom Jodi Greebel of New York. And there's conflicting evidence about whether pesticides andhormonesin conventional foods are harmful.""But the general feeling is that anything harmful will have a stronger effect on babies because of their small size  bad substances won't be as diluted as they are in an adult.""Some studies suggest a link between pesticide exposure and cancer as well as developmental problems in children, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and poor intellectual development. But the short-term and long-term effects of pesticide exposure are still poorly understood, and experts disagree on just how concerned parents should be. In deciding whether to feed your baby all, some, or no organic food, consider what works for your family andyourbudget.The organic factor also matters more with some foods than others. For example, apples, spinach, and strawberries have the highest pesticide residue levels. On the other hand, sweet corn, cabbage, and avocados tend to have relatively low levels. The nonprofitEnvironmental Working Groupranks 48 fruits and vegetables from best to worst in terms of pesticide residue.Greebel and Block also recommend buying organic meat and poultry when possible.""Both come from animals that were not treated with antibiotics."" says Greebel.Keep in mind that conventional meat and poultry can still be free of antibiotics and hormones. The federal government prohibits the use of hormones when raising hogs and poultry, so just check packages of beef for a label like ""no hormones administered,"" and check meat and poultry products for labels indicating that no antibiotics were added. Visit the United States Department of Agriculture's website for more information about meat and poultry labeling terms.Whatever you decide, remember that general good nutrition trumps organics. ""The most important thing is to provide your baby with a wide variety of healthy foods,"" says Greebel.Expand your baby's tastesAlthough consistency in everything from bedtime to discipline is a hallmark of sound parenting advice, a little inconsistency at mealtime can be a wonderful thing. Changing up the menu broadens your baby's palate and helps to ensure good nutrition, especially when it comes to produce. (For ideas to get you started, check out these experts' suggestions foradventurous first foods.)Often this means heaving ourselves out of a well-worn food rut. Stuck on sweet potatoes? Shake things up with some steamed beets. Smashed peas and carrots every night? Consider pureed brussels sprouts instead. Oat cereal overload? Try quinoa.""I gave my baby quinoa cooked in vegetable broth,"" says dietitian Karin Hosenfeld of North Dallas Nutrition. ""It's loaded with heart healthy protein.""Or instead of chicken, chicken, and more chicken, consider serving your baby pureed duck leg. ""It's easy to cook and tastes great,"" says food writer Matthew Amster-Burton.Find out which rules for feeding solids still applyIdeas about what to feed your baby may be changing, but many recommendations for introducing solids and encouraging your baby to eat well still stand.

Top 7 tips for new and expecting grandparents,https://www.babycenter.com/0_top-7-tips-for-new-and-expecting-grandparents_10360339.bc,"Congratulations, you're a grandparent! It's a big deal  and an event you may have been anticipating for a long time.But this transition brings challenges as well as joy. Here are seven tips to help you avoid common new-grandparent pitfalls and handle your new role with flair and grace.Set the stage for smooth relationshipsRight from the get-go, many expecting parents experience tension or a feeling of being torn between two  or even three or four  sets of grandparents forcefully asserting their wishes. It's a recipe for stress that soon-to-be moms and dads definitely don't need.As much as you can, stay positive, be flexible, and go with the flow. Focus on supporting the expecting parents rather than telling them what you want  they'll appreciate it.When it comes to visits, especially the all-important first visit to see the baby, be sensitive. You may not be invited to attend the birth or come to the hospital or birth center right afterward. Don't be offended  it's the new mom and dad's decision to make. Same goes if they don't jump on your baby-name suggestions.It may make life easier for everyone if you communicate directly with the other grandparents  about events like a baby shower, for example  rather than going through the parents-to-be. If you haven't met the other grandparents yet, ask for an introduction.Finally, if you're divorced from your adult child's other parent, it's a good time to fix any unmended fences. Like it or not, you're going to be sharing grandparenting duties with your ex, as well as with his or her new spouse or partner if there is one. Don't make an already sticky situation any more difficult.Listen and deferNo matter how many kids you raised or how they turned out, your adult child and his or her spouse or partner are now in charge of the childrearing. Be cautious about offering opinions or advice unless asked directly. And even then, tread lightly and express yourself gently.""It's all about respecting boundaries,"" says family therapist Christine Lawlor, who's helped many families work on grandparent-related issues. ""Everyone parents differently, and it's your child's turn to learn what works for them.""It's hard to keep your lips zipped when you hear things you disagree with, from what kind of birth the parents are planning to what kind of childcare they're considering. But you need to.If you try to intervene with a contrary opinion, you're setting yourself up as an adversary, says New York family therapist Sharon O'Neill, author of A Short Guide to a Happy Marriage. Over time, you'll strain your relationship with the new parents and your grandchildren.Let the parents-to-be experiment  not every decision they make will stick. And not everything they put out there needs to provoke a reaction, either. Sometimes they're just thinking out loud. ""Allow them to grow in their roles as parents,"" Lawlor says.Lastly, no gloating or ""I told you so"" when something you disagreed with doesn't work. Everyone has to learn things for themselves.Go easy on the shoppingWith a new grandchild on the way, it's tempting to go on a shopping spree. But before you do, ask the parents-to-be what they need, what they don't want, and whether there's a baby registry or wish list you can consult before you buy anything.Some expectant parents welcome all gifts, but others would prefer to make most of the choices about clothing, toys, and gear themselves. And there may be other factors they're weighing, like an impending move or limited space.Some parents-to-be take the ""less is more"" philosophy and don't want to fill their homes with bulky baby gear, at least not right away. Others would much rather have financial help or contributions to a savings account. Don't take their choices personallyThey're advocates of co-sleeping? Don't want to circumcise? Want to name their baby boy Peach? Honestly, it's not your problem. Yes, you may feel a tad embarrassed sharing your grandson's new moniker with your friends, but you didn't name him, right? Just raise your eyebrows and report it with a smile.Let bonding happen naturallyYou've been so excited to meet the new baby  and then she wails nonstop whenever she's in your arms and ignores your coos and funny faces. It's disappointing, sure, but don't fret that your relationship will always be so rocky.""Of course you can anticipate having a wonderful relationship with your grandchild, but that doesn't automatically happen,"" says Amy Goyer, multigenerational family expert for the AARP and author of Things to Do Now That You're a Grandparent. ""It takes time and work and may not always resemble the picture you have in your mind.""Try to avoid specific expectations they can be a recipe for disappointment. Instead, focus on getting to know your grandchild slowly and naturally and look for as many ways as possible to be involved in his or her life. If she screams when passed to you, keep trying. She may just need time to get comfortable with someone other than Mom and Dad.Follow their rulesYou're used to being the one in charge, but this time it's your child's turn. That can be disconcerting, but you may find this role reversal refreshing as well. After all, with authority comes responsibility. Now it's your turn to do what you're told  and not worry about whether it's the best way or not.If your grandchild has a routine for naps and meals, make sure you maintain it, even if it means cutting an outing short. ""If every time Sammy goes out with Grandma he comes home exhausted and cranky, those outings are not going to happen as often,"" says O'Neill, the family therapist.If the parents say no solid food yet and to keep the TV off when the baby's awake, respect their wishes. The same goes for their house rules: If they're strict about recycling, don't throw your water bottles in the trash.And if the new parents aren't always gracious when explaining their do's and don'ts, or get snippy with you over something minor, try to keep your cool. Sleep deprivation  and the stresses of new parenthood  are probably to blame. Give new parents a breakIt's easy to forget how overwhelming it is to be a new parent, and how hard it can be to accomplish the basics. This is where you can step in to save the day.During visits, offer to take care of your grandbaby while the parents nap or get other things done. Ask if you can help by running errands, making meals, or cleaning up. Some new parents are reluctant to ask grandparents to help, so you may get better results if you just jump in and do what's needed, like filling the dishwasher or making sandwiches.If other family members are also dropping by, offer to help field phone calls or emails to schedule visits. This can be invaluable for a nursing mom or sleep-deprived dad.It may be easier for the new parents if you stay in a hotel nearby rather than in their home. This way they won't try to take on hosting duties on top of their parenting responsibilities.It's worth asking ahead of time, says Goyer of the AARP. ""Your suggestion may be met with relief, or they may say it's not necessary, but you've put the option out there,"" she says.Forgive the new parents for being overwhelmed and self-absorbed  it's natural. Your child and his or her spouse or partner probably won't have time for the things you used to do together, and your conversations will likely be all about them, at least for a while.If you expect this and practice patience, you're less likely to become hurt or resentful. And you can be pleasantly surprised when they emerge from the new-parent fog and become your thoughtful loved ones again."
Breastfeeding and supplementing with formula,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-and-supplementing-with-formula_8484.bc,"Is it okay to supplement my breastfed baby's diet with formula?Yes, it's perfectly safe to supplement a breastfed baby's diet withformula. Some moms decide to supplement with formula when they go back to work. They may have trouble pumping regularly, but they don't want to give up nursing entirely.Others supplement because their baby isn't getting enough breast milk to grow properly. And many moms just want the freedom to let a family member or babysitter give an occasional bottle.Whatever your reasons for supplementing, keep in mind that any amount of breast milk is always better than none, so the longer you can nurse your baby, the better  even if it's just once or twice a day. Although formula provides all the nutrients your baby needs, it lacks the unique immune factors that can protect your baby from some illnesses.Will supplementing with formula affect my milk supply?Your supply of breast milk depends on your baby's demand for it, so the less often you nurse, the less milk your breasts will produce.If you supplement with one or two bottles a week, the effect on your milk supply should be minimal. But if you start supplementing with formula regularly, even for just one feeding a day, your milk supply will diminish (at least until you reinstate the missed feeding).You can alsopump breast milkwhen you're giving your baby supplemental formula to build up a bank of expressed milk to freeze and use later. This will help to keep your milk supply up, even as you're bottle-feeding with formula or breast milk more frequently.Nursing bra buying guide (Before You Buy series) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 3:28Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -3:28Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosHow do I know whether my baby's getting enough breast milk?Many mothers worry that they're not producing enough milk for their babies, but most women make plenty of milk. Here are three ways you can tell whether your baby's getting enough:Plenty of dirty diapers. A baby younger than 1 month old who's nursing well will have frequent mustard-yellow stools. Some babies have one after every feeding. Your baby will also have six to eight wet diapers a day if he's getting enough breast milk.Weigh your baby several times a week. He should be gaining an average of half an ounce to an ounce a day during the first three months, and half an ounce a day between 3 and 6 months.Frequent, round-the-clock nursing. You're breastfeeding at least seven times every 24 hours. (During your baby's first month, you should nurse even more, at least eight to 12 times per day.) Even if your baby wants to nurse all the time, that doesn't necessarily mean he's hungry. Some babies nurse for comfort, have a strong urge to suck, or simply crave contact with their mother.What are some signs that my baby needs supplemental formula for growth?Talk to your baby's doctor if you have any concerns about your baby's weight gain, growth, or eating habits. Here are some symptoms that warrant a call:More than normal weight loss in a newborn. Babies lose up to 10 percent of their birth weight during the first five days of life. By day five, they start to gain about an ounce a day, and by 2 weeks they should be back up to their birth weight.Your breasts don't feel soft or empty after nursing, which could be a sign that your baby isn't taking in enough milk.Fewer than six wet diapers in a 24-hour period once your baby is 5 days old.Fussiness or lethargy most of the time.Baby bottles and nipples buying guide (Before You Buy series) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 3:08Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -3:08Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosWhen can I start supplementing with formula?If your baby is a newborn, you might want to wait until he's at least a month old before you introduce formula. Lactation consultants recommend waiting this long to allow your breastfeeding routine and your milk supply to become well established so an occasional bottle won't disrupt the routine too much. At this age most babies aren't completely reluctant to try a bottle or a new food source.If your baby is over a month old, you can offer formula at any time.What's the best way to introduce a bottle?Unfortunately there's no perfect way to start supplementing, and it's common for babies to refuse formula in a bottle initially. Don't give up too easily  it may take more than a few tries to get your baby to drink formula from a bottle.Some babies will just go with the flow and, if they're hungry, take whatever you give them. Others may refuse a bottle the first few times it's offered, especially if you're the one offering it. That's because your baby can smell you and would probably prefer the real thing, which is sweeter.If your baby is used to taking a bottle of breast milk, the transition may be a bit easier, though she may turn up her nose at what'sinthe bottle.To make this transition smoother, let your partner or a friend offer the first few bottles. You might also try giving the bottle when your baby is hungry rather than at a feeding when she might be nursing as much for comfort as for nourishment.Can I mix breast milk and formula in one bottle?Lactation consultants say it's better not to mix breast milk with formula because you may end up wasting that hard-earned breast milk if your baby doesn't finish the bottle. Instead, feed your baby the pumped breast milk first, and if he still seems hungry, offer a new bottle with formula.How will supplementing with formula affect my baby?If you start supplementing regularly, your baby might start refusing the breast. A bottle delivers milk faster than a breast, so if your baby's an enthusiastic eater, she might prefer the bottle's quick delivery system.If your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.You might also notice that your baby's willing to go a little bit longer after a meal of formula. That's because babies don't digest formula as quickly as they digest breast milk, so they're likely to feel full longer.Your baby's bowel movements will be markedly different once she's drinking some formula. They'll be firmer than they were when she was drinking only breast milk, about the consistency of peanut butter. They'll be tan or brown in color, have a stronger odor, and probably be less frequent than when she was drinking only breast milk.If your baby's vomit or stool contains spots of blood after you introduce formula, call your baby's doctor. This is a sign of milk intolerance.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011a. Bottle feeding.

If you choose a chewable supplement, check the label carefully because it may have added sugar your child doesn't need.Here are some ways BabyCenter parents get fish oil into their kids:Hide the flavor in something else""I add cod liver oil to my son's nightly bottle of milk. If your kids are beyond the bottle stage, try adding the oil to a fruit smoothie or yogurt. I make myself a smoothie every morning, and I never taste the fish oil."" Carly""We use orange-flavored cod oil which is pretty tasty. I mix it into applesauce and cinnamon, and it's one of my daughter's favorite treats. I've also mixed it into oatmeal with cinnamon, maple syrup, apples, and walnuts."" Minimom""We use a lemon-flavored fish oil. Here's how I hide it: Drizzle it on bread before applying peanut butter and jelly. Marinate tofu or chicken cubes in fish oil mixed with a little olive oil and soy sauce. Use fish oil instead of or along with olive oil on pasta. Drizzle fish oil on steamed, sauted, or roasted veggies."" Lisa99""I buy the lemon-flavored cod liver oil and mix 1 teaspoon of it with ice cream or lemon sorbet. It doesn't bother my kids at all."" Dashsmommy""I mix 1/2 teaspoon with just enough chocolate nutrition shake powder to make a paste. My children love it, and they get a few extra vitamins."" A BabyCenter memberTry a simple approach""My kids love the gummy fruit-flavored ones. They taste good!"" PattyO""I am working on getting my girls to take fish oil capsules at night. The child version capsules are so small they can swallow them without chewing them. Great thing about taking them right before bed is that they won't be awake for that fish burp that always comes!"" A BabyCenter member""My parents gave my sisters and me cod liver oil capsules as children as an after dinner 'treat.' I can still chew them, and I don't think they taste bad at all. My daughter is 3, and my husband and I have done the same thing with her. Now every night she asks for her 'codly oil.'"" A BabyCenter memberShow sources Hide sources MedlinePlus. 2012.

Medication for iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_medication-for-iron-deficiency-anemia-during-pregnancy_10414723.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWhat medication is used to treat iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy?If you have iron-deficiency anemia, it means your body has a low level of iron, which is necessary to build healthy red blood cells. The most effective treatment for anemia during pregnancy is to take an iron supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamin.It may take a little trial and error to determine the correct dose. Work with your healthcare provider to balance effectiveness with any unpleasant side effects. You may have to take your prenatal vitamin and iron supplement at different times.Are iron supplements safe to take in pregnancy?Yes, iron supplements are safe to take during pregnancy. And if you take the supplements as prescribed, you should see an improvement in your iron-deficiency anemia.Take your regular prenatal vitamin  you still need this for other vital minerals. And make iron part of your pregnancy diet, too.Note: Iron supplements for adults can be dangerous for children. Children can get very sick, or even die, from accidentally taking iron pills. Keep your iron pills safely out of the reach of children.What are the side effects of iron supplements?The first thing you may notice when you start taking iron is that your stools turn a dark color, almost black, because your body doesn't completely absorb the mineral. Although it looks different, there's no need to worry. This is just a normal reaction to the extra iron in your body.Gastrointestinal side effects are most common. You may feel bloated or nauseated, or have an upset stomach.Being constipated and unable to have a bowel movement is another common side effect of pregnancy, and iron supplements can make constipation worse. If you're suffering from constipation, drink plenty of fluids, eat at least 25 grams of fiber a day, and use the bathroom whenever you feel the urge to have a bowel movement.Work with your provider to come up with an exercise plan, and try drinking prune juice to get things moving. Your provider might also prescribe a stool softener.How do I deal with the side effects of iron, and take it so it's most effective?How and when you take iron makes a big difference. For example, if you feel nauseated after taking your supplement, try taking it with a small snack or some juice. Don't take iron with a meal  too much food prevents iron absorption.Iron is best absorbed with acid. Take supplements with orange juice, so your body can get the maximum benefits.Medication can also affect how your body absorbs iron. For example, heartburn is another common ailment during pregnancy, and antacids can affect the absorption of iron. If you need to take antacids, it's best to take your iron supplement at least two hours before or two hours after the antacid.Iron can also prevent the absorption of certain drugs, like levothyroxine, which is taken for thyroid problems. If you take iron and levothyroxine, take the pills four hours apart. Check whether you need to adjust the timing of your other medications.Some foods and drinks can even prevent your body from absorbing iron properly. These include:Coffee and teaEggsDairy productsBran, soy, nuts and seeds, and other foods high in phytates (the storage form of phosphorus)For the best results, try to take supplements one hour before or two hours after consuming these foods and drinks. The same may apply to calcium supplements.This seems like a lot to remember, but it becomes second nature once you get into a routine. And don't give up if you're experiencing unpleasant side effects from iron supplements. Your provider may recommend a different type of supplement or suggest splitting the dose into smaller quantities to take at intervals throughout the day.Are there any alternatives to iron supplements?Talk to your provider about your options. If you can't tolerate taking an iron pill, ask for a liquid supplement. (You may want to use a straw to take liquid iron supplements so you don't stain your teeth.)If you have severe iron-deficiency anemia that doesn't respond well to iron supplements, you may need to get iron intravenously. Your provider can do this or she can refer you to a hematologist or a maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

The lowdown on children's vitamins,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-lowdown-on-childrens-vitamins_64355.bc,"Should I give my child a vitamin supplement?Experts disagree about whether a daily multivitamin or mineral supplement is necessary for all children. For example, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), advises giving your child a supplement only if your child's doctor recommends one. The AAP claims most children don't need supplements because so many common foods are fortified.On the other hand, the AAP acknowledges that taking a supplement won't do any harm as long as it doesn't exceed the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for any vitamin or mineral.Other experts believe that taking a daily supplement is a good way to compensate for any shortfalls in your child's diet.Most experts do agree that:Taking a daily supplement won't hurt as long as it doesn't exceed the RDA for any one vitamin or mineral.Some children  like vegetarians or those with food sensitivities  might need a daily supplement to meet the RDA for certain vitamins or minerals.Supplements are not a substitute for whole foods and should never be used to justify a poor diet. If your child isn't eating well, give him a multivitamin in addition to taking steps to improve his eating habits.The bottom line: If you're concerned that your child isn't meeting the requirements of a balanced diet listed in theU.S. Department of Agriculture's recommendations, a daily multivitamin or mineral supplement can't hurt.Should I give my child a vitamin if she's a picky eater?If you're concerned that your child's diet is lacking  because she won't put anything green in her mouth or because she goes on food jags for days  you might want to give her a supplement for your peace of mind.It provides a little extra insurance that she's getting what he needs, says dietitian Debby Demory-Luce.What kind of vitamin should I give my child?Any generic children's multivitamin (chewable or liquid) will do unless your child has special needs. For example, if your child is a vegetarian, you'll want to make sure that the supplement contains vitamins B12 and D, as well as riboflavin and calcium, which may be lacking in his diet. And if your doctor has determined that your child is anemic, she may recommend a supplement with a specific amount of iron.Also, children younger than 4 aren't able to grind foods when they chew, so give them liquid vitamins to prevent a choking hazard.Children often don't get enough Vitamin D, so the AAP recommends that most children  from babies to adolescents  take a supplement with 400 IU of vitamin D.Note that supplements often don't contain 100 percent of every vitamin and mineral, so you'll still want to make sure your child gets the needed vitamin or mineral from food sources too.If your child doesn't drink milk or eat enough dairy, for example, and only gets about 15 to 20 percent of the RDA for calcium from his supplement, then you'll need to find other food-based sources, such as calcium-fortified orange juice.When choosing a vitamin supplement for your child, read the label carefully. One national survey found that when young children who had diets low in certain nutrients were given vitamin supplements, some of the kids wound up getting more than the recommended upper limit of vitamin A, folic acid, and zinc. So it's a good idea to make sure the supplement you're giving your child isn't high in these nutrients unless your child's doctor says otherwise.Also, keep in mind that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't hold supplements to the same standards drugs must meet before they're manufactured, so quality and potency might vary between brands. (See our article onbuying supplementsfor guidance.)And don't substitute a vitamin drink for a vitamin supplement. Often vitamin drinks (including sports or energy drinks) contain caffeine and added sugar.Should I give my child more than one vitamin a day if his diet is especially bad one week?No. There's no reason to give your child more than the recommended daily dose (usually one pill a day). ""Some people think that a little is good but more is better,"" says Demory-Luce, ""but this is a dangerous way to approach vitamins.""Not only could it hurt your child, as with too much iron, but an overdose of certain vitamins could also prevent the absorption of others, creating a nutritional imbalance.What precautions should I take with vitamins?Vitamins are formulated to appeal to children and often resemble candy, so kids may eat several at a time if given the opportunity. But getting too much of certain vitamins and minerals (iron, in particular) could be dangerous, or even fatal.So treat vitamins as medicines. Make sure the caps are childproof, but don't depend on them  always keep vitamin bottles well out of the reach of your child.Dietitian Demory-Luce, mother of two, learned this lesson the hard way: ""My youngster got his hands on a bottle of vitamins, opened the safety top, and ate ten vitamins before I got to him,"" she says. ""Luckily, the vitamins didn't have iron in them."" Now she keeps vitamins locked away in a cabinet.To be safe, call poison control if you suspect that your child has taken vitamins on his own, even if they don't contain iron.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2013.

Managing iron-deficiency anemia in pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_managing-iron-deficiency-anemia-in-pregnancy_10414724.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineHow do I know I have iron-deficiency anemia?If you have iron-deficiency anemia (IDA), you might not have any symptoms at all, especially if your condition is mild. Or you might feel tired, weak, or dizzy. You might experience these symptoms during pregnancy anyway, so you may not know you have iron-deficiency anemia until you have a blood test.Because IDA is a common condition during pregnancy, your healthcare provider will test your blood for anemia at your first prenatal appointment.Even if you're not anemic at the beginning of pregnancy, it's common to develop anemia as your pregnancy progresses, so you'll have another blood test in your second or third trimester.How is iron-deficiency anemia diagnosed?Various blood tests determine if you have iron-deficiency anemia. Your provider uses a test called a complete blood count (CBC) to see if you have anemia. This test measures various aspects of blood, but when it's used to diagnose anemia, the hematocrit (Hct) and hemoglobin (Hgb or Hb) levels are the important numbers in a CBC.Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein found in red blood cells. Hemoglobin transports oxygen around your body. Your blood will be tested to see the number of grams of hemoglobin you have in your blood.The hematocrit measurement shows the percentage of red blood cells in plasma, the fluid component of blood. Low levels of hemoglobin or hematocrit are signs of anemia.If Hgb levels are less than 11 grams of hemoglobin per deciliter of blood (g/dL) and the Hct level is less than 33 percent in the first trimester of pregnancy, you'll be diagnosed with anemia. (These levels apply to the third trimester as well.)It's normal for hemoglobin and hematocrit levels to go down somewhat in the second trimester of pregnancy. At this stage, the amount of blood in the body is expanding dramatically, and the amount of plasma increases faster than the number and size of red blood cells. In the second trimester, you'll be diagnosed with anemia if you have an Hgb level of 10.5 g/dL and an Hct level of 32 percent.A number of conditions can cause anemia but iron deficiency is the most common. So your healthcare provider will likely treat you for iron-deficiency anemia without suggesting any further tests to confirm the diagnosis.What if I have anemia and my iron levels don't improve?If your iron levels don't begin to improve after starting treatment, or your provider isn't sure whether your anemia is caused by a lack of iron or another condition, she may suggest additional testing to confirm the diagnosis. This test could be one or more of the following:Serum ferritin testThis is another type of blood test. It's considered the most accurate and sensitive test for measuring IDA.Ferritin is a protein that stores iron in cells. The amount of ferritin in blood also shows how much iron there is.Reticulocyte countReticulocytes are immature red blood cells. A reticulocyte count shows whether the body is making enough new red blood cells.Peripheral smearIn this test, the size and shape of red blood cells are examined under a microscope. If you have IDA, the blood cells will look smaller and paler than normal.Serum ironThis test measures the amount of iron in blood.Transferrin levelTransferrin carries iron in the blood. The transferrin level, also known as the total iron-binding capacity, measures how much transferrin in blood isn't carrying iron.What's the treatment for iron-deficiency anemia?Although there's iron in many foods, eating an iron-rich diet won't be enough to treat anemia. So your provider will prescribe iron supplements.The supplement is tailored to you and the amount of extra iron you need, but typically contains between 60 and 120 milligrams (mg) of iron a day. You also need to take a standard prenatal vitamin, which contains approximately 30 mg of iron.These doses refer to the amount of elemental iron, or pure iron, in a supplement. Some labels list the amount of the iron compound instead of, or in addition to, the amount of elemental iron. Here's how much elemental iron is in each compound:Ferrous sulfate: 325 mg has about 65 mg of elemental iron. (Ferrous sulfate is the most commonly used iron supplement.)Ferrous gluconate: 300 mg has about 34 mg of elemental iron.Ferrous fumarate: 325 mg has about 106 mg of elemental iron.Read labels closely and talk to your healthcare provider if you have questions.How do I get the most out of my iron supplement?In order to absorb as much of the iron as possible, take iron supplements either one hour before or two hours after eating.How long will it take for iron levels to rise?For most women, iron supplements are an effective treatment for anemia. Within two weeks of starting to take iron supplements, hemoglobin levels should begin to rise, although it may be a month or two before you're tested again.If there's no improvement in iron levels, your provider may want to investigate whether your anemia is caused by something other than iron deficiency.If additional testing rules this out and confirms IDA instead, your provider may recommend parenteral iron. This is iron given intravenously, either in the hospital or at your provider's office.One important point to note about iron tablets: They're safe to take during pregnancy, but keep them in childproof containers and stored away from children.What are the side effects of iron supplements?Unfortunately, iron supplements have common side effects. Constipation is a problem if you're taking iron tablets, as is a feeling of bloating, nausea, and sometimes having an upset tummy.If nausea is a problem, you might be able to reduce it by timing when you take your iron supplements. Taking them a couple of hours after eating may suit you better than taking them first thing in the morning on a completely empty stomach. Or you may want to take them at bedtime to try to sleep through the worst of the nausea.You'll probably notice that your stool changes color and becomes darker than normal, which is a perfectly normal result of the extra amount of iron in your body.Although the side effects might be unpleasant, don't stop taking your supplements. If they cause problems, talk to your provider.There are a number of options to reduce symptoms. These include:Splitting the dose into smaller quantities to take at intervals during the day.Trying an alternative brand or type of iron supplement.Switching to the liquid form of ferrous sulfate instead of tablets. This makes it easier to adjust the dose until your symptoms become more tolerable.The downside is that these options can take longer to build up iron stores in the body because they have a lower amount of iron than the typical supplement.Will I see my healthcare provider more often?It's normal to experience mild anemia in pregnancy, so if you take iron supplements as directed, you're unlikely to need additional treatment. In most cases, you'll have your blood tested again during the second or third trimester to see if things have improved.If anemia is severe and you have very low iron levels, then you may need to have blood tests more frequently  as often as every month  so your provider can monitor you carefully.If you have severe anemia, you may also need extra care. Typically your provider will refer you to a hematologist or a maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist for care. You may also need to have intravenous iron supplementation.You may have a blood transfusion if your anemia is so severe that you're experiencing complications that could be dangerous to you or your baby. However, it's rare to need a blood transfusion during pregnancy. Most women are treated successfully with iron supplements or an intravenous iron infusion.Does changing what I eat help?Yes. Iron from iron-rich food is absorbed well by the body. Having an iron-rich diet protects against iron-deficiency anemia, and consuming iron-rich food with iron supplements can build up iron stores.Examples of healthy, iron-rich foods include:Red meatEnriched breakfast cerealsBeansLentilsShrimpTurkey (dark meat)The body absorbs iron from animal sources (heme iron) much more easily than iron from nonanimal sources (nonheme iron).Eating or drinking something rich in vitamin C when you take an iron supplement or eating iron-rich plant foods can help the body absorb significantly more nonheme iron. Good vitamin C choices include a glass of orange or tomato juice, a handful of strawberries, sliced bell peppers, or half a grapefruit.Calcium, found in milk, cheese and yogurt, is an important component of a healthy pregnancy diet but hinders the body's ability to absorb iron. Don't drink milk with meals or when you take an iron supplement. Also, don't add cheese to iron-rich recipes.The same goes for tea and coffee, which also interfere with the absorption of iron.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

Prenatal vitamins: Why they're so important,https://www.babycenter.com/0_prenatal-vitamins-why-theyre-so-important_287.bc,"Are prenatal vitamins really necessary?Yes. It's hard to get all the nutrients you and your baby need, even if you eat a wide variety of food, including meat, dairy products, fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes.Most women can benefit from taking a prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement (preferably before trying to conceive). Think of it as an insurance policy to make sure you're getting the right amount of certain crucial nutrients during pregnancy.Taking a prenatal vitamin is even more important for women with dietary restrictions, health issues, or pregnancy complications. This includes women who:Are vegetarians or vegansAre lactose intolerant or have other food intolerancesSmoke or abuse other substancesHave certain blood disordersHave an eating disorderHave certain chronic diseasesHave had gastric bypass surgeryArehaving twins or higher multiplesWhat does your OB-GYN want you to know before getting pregnant?

See all videosWhat's in a prenatal supplement that I can't get from food?Two crucial nutrients  folic acid and iron  are almost always included in prenatal vitamins because most pregnant women don't get enough of them from food alone.Folic acidGetting enough of this B vitamin in the month before you conceive and very early in your pregnancy can reduce your baby's risk of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and anencephaly, by up to 70 percent. Folic acid may also reduce the risk of other defects, such as cleft lip, cleft palate, and certain heart defects. Taking folic acid may even lower your risk ofpreeclampsia.Your body absorbs the synthetic version of folic acid better than the natural one found in food, so even if you eat a balanced diet, a supplement is strongly recommended.For more details, see our complete article onfolic acid in your pregnancy diet.IronMost moms-to-be don't get enough of this mineral from their diet to meet their body's increased need during pregnancy, and this can lead toiron-deficiency anemia. Preventing iron-deficiency anemia can cut your risk ofpreterm delivery, low birth weight, and infant mortality.For more details, see our complete article oniron in your pregnancy diet. Due Date CalculatorFind out your due date, and see how big your baby is right now.What nutrients do I need that may not be in a prenatal supplement?CalciumYour prenatal vitamin may containcalcium, but there's a chance it won't be enough. You need calcium to help your baby grow strong bones and teeth as well ashealthy nerves and muscles (including the heart).Most prenatal vitamins contain between 100 and 200 milligrams (mg) of calcium, but some don't contain any. That's because calcium is a particularly bulky mineral, and the pills are already big enough!To find out how much calcium you need and how to get it, see our complete article oncalcium in your pregnancy diet.Essential fatty acidsPrenatal vitamins don't contain anyessential fatty acids, such as the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA, which are important for the development of your baby's brain, nerve, and eye tissue.Fish is a major source of DHA and EPA, but you have to be careful about not eating too much fish that's high in mercury while you're pregnant.Because omega-3s are so important for your baby, it's a good idea to talk with your healthcare practitioner about whether you need a supplement.Learn more:Dietary fats in your pregnancy dietEating fish during pregnancyTaking fish oil supplements during pregnancyVitamin DYour body needs this fat-soluble vitamin to help build your baby's bones and teeth. Vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining levels of calcium and phosphorus.If you're lacking vitamin D during pregnancy, your baby may be short on the vitamin at birth. This can put your child at risk for rickets (which can lead to fractures and deformity), abnormal bone growth, and delayed physical development. A deficiency of vitamin D has also been linked to a greater risk of developingpregnancy complications such as preeclampsiaand gestational diabetes, but more research is needed to confirm these links.To find out how much vitamin D you need and how to get it, see our complete article onvitamin D in your pregnancy diet.When should I start taking prenatal vitamins?Take a prenatal vitamin every day as soon as you realize you're pregnant.Because folic acid is so important in the earliest weeks of your pregnancy, ideally you would start taking prenatal vitamins before you conceive  that's why many doctors recommend them for women who might become pregnant.Taking prenatal vitamins for at least three months before you conceive also could lessen morning sickness once you're pregnant.And if you breastfeed your baby, your doctor might recommend you continue taking prenatal vitamins even after your baby is born.How do I choose a prenatal supplement that's right for me?Unfortunately, no standards have been set for what should be in vitamin and mineral supplements because the Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate them. That means it's up to you and your healthcare practitioner to make sure you choose one that's safe and appropriate for you. (See our article onbuying supplementsfor more guidance.)At your first prenatal checkup or at a preconception visit, your practitioner will probably prescribe a daily vitamin or recommend an over-the-counter brand. A good supplement provides certain nutrients (such as folic acid and iron) that you may not be able to get enough of from your diet. But it also provides no more than the recommended amounts of other nutrients that can be harmful to your baby if you take too much  likevitamin A.Vitamin A derived from animal products can cause birth defects when taken in high doses. That's why the vitamin A in most prenatal vitamins is at least partly in the form of beta-carotene.Beta-carotene is a nutrient found in fruits and vegetables, and your body converts this type to vitamin A. Unlike vitamin A from animal products, beta-carotene is considered safe even in high doses.Note: Make sure you don't take any other vitamin or mineral supplements while you're taking a prenatal supplement unless your practitioner recommends it. What if I mistakenly take two prenatal vitamins on the same day?Don't worry. Taking twice the recommended amounts of these nutrients on just one day won't harm you or your baby. But taking a double dose more often can be harmful, so it's important not to do it regularly.If your practitioner says you need more of a certain nutrient than your prenatal vitamin provides, take the additional amount as a separate supplement.What if I have trouble swallowing the pills?Prenatal vitamin and mineral supplements tend to be pretty big. They can be hard to swallow, especially if you're dealing withnausea.If this is a problem for you, your practitioner may be able to recommend a smaller pill or one with a slick coating that makes it easier to get down. (Pills that don't contain calcium tend to be smaller, and you can get your calcium in other ways.)Chewable prenatal vitamins are also available. There's even a powdered pregnancy supplement that you mix with water. So if you don't like one version, keep trying different options until you find a prenatal supplement you can take.What if the vitamins upset my stomach?If you're taking a supplement with more than the recommended 30 mg of iron, it may upset your gastrointestinal tract. (Supplements that contain 30 mg or less probably won't cause you any problems.)To avoid queasiness, try taking your supplement at bedtime or with a meal to make it easier to tolerate.Taking a lot of iron can lead to constipation, which is already a problem for many pregnant women. It can also cause nausea or, more rarely, diarrhea.If iron upsets your stomach, talk to your healthcare practitioner about it. If you're not anemic, it may make sense for you to switch to a prenatal vitamin with less iron. Otherwise, try to ease constipation by:Drinking prune juiceEating two to three servings of fruit a dayTaking a psyllium fiber supplementShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2014.

Does my baby need to take vitamins?,https://www.babycenter.com/404_does-my-baby-need-to-take-vitamins_9154.bc,
Iron-deficiency anemia in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-deficiency-anemia-in-babies_10860.bc,"My baby seems pale and weak. Could it be anemia?Yes. In fact, the most typical signs of anemia are pale skin and tiredness. Other signs include rapid heartbeat, irritability, loss of appetite, brittle nails, and a sore or swollen tongue. But it's common for a baby with anemia not to have any symptoms at all.What is anemia, and what causes it?People become anemic when red blood cells don't carry enough oxygen to the tissues in their body. Various conditions can cause anemia, including an inherited illness called sickle cell anemia, but iron deficiency is the most common cause.The human body needs iron to make hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying red pigment in blood. If your baby doesn't get enough iron, he'll have fewer red blood cells  and the ones he has will be smaller, so his body tissues will receive less oxygen than they should.Children are especially susceptible to anemia during periods of rapid growth, when they need extra iron that they don't always get. But iron-deficiency anemia doesn't happen overnight  it's caused by a relatively severe deficiency that develops over time.Iron deficiencies can happen for several reasons, including not enough iron in the diet, ongoing blood loss (in the intestinal tract, for example), and poor absorption of iron.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.Is anemia dangerous?It can be.In addition to the symptoms mentioned above, a child who's anemic could suffer permanent mental and physical problems. (While an iron deficiency can be corrected, the mental and physical impairment is not always reversible.)Iron deficiency also makes kids more susceptible to lead poisoning and infection.Is my baby at risk for anemia?Between 9 and 24 months, all children are at high risk for anemia, but these babies are at highest risk:Premature and low-birth-weight babies age 2 months old and older. Full-term infants are born with iron stores accumulated during the last months in utero. These stores can last four to six months. The iron stores of babies born prematurely may last only about two months.Babies who drink cow's milk before their first birthday. Cow's milk is low in iron. It also interferes with the body's absorption of iron, and it may replace some iron-rich foods in the diet. Milk can also irritate the lining of a baby's intestine, causing bleeding. This slow loss of blood in the stool  along with low iron intake  can cause anemia.Breastfed babies who receive no iron-fortified foods after 4 months of age. The iron in breast milk is absorbed three times better than the iron in formula, but around the time a baby starts eating solids, he needs additional iron in the form of fortified cereals and other iron-rich foods.Full-term, formula-fed babies who aren't given iron-fortified formula. Most baby formula is fortified with iron, however.Should I call the doctor?The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies be screened for anemia at 12 months, or earlier if they were born prematurely. But if you notice any signs of anemia, do call your baby's doctor.To determine whether your baby is anemic, the doctor will do a blood test to measure levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit (percentage of red blood cells in the blood).Can I prevent my baby from becoming anemic?You can prevent your baby from developing iron deficiency anemia. Here's how:If your baby was born prematurely or at a low birth weight, talk with his doctor about iron supplements.Until he's a year old, give your baby breast milk or iron-fortified formula, not cow's milk.If your baby is 4 months old and breastfed and not yet eating solid foods, the AAP recommends giving him an iron supplement of 11 milligrams (mg) per day until he starts eating iron-rich foods.Once your baby starts eating solids, feed him iron-fortified cereal, and eventually iron-rich foods like lean meats, poultry, and fish; iron-fortified pasta, rice, and bread; leafy green vegetables; egg yolks; and legumes. (See our age-by-age guide for more details about when to feed your baby various foods.)Offer plenty of fruits and vegetables that are rich in vitamin C, such as kiwi, avocado, and cantaloupe). Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron.How is anemia treated in babies?It's important to boost your baby's iron intake once he's eating solids, but dietary changes aren't always enough to correct anemia. He may also need an iron supplement, usually given in the form of drops.Iron is absorbed best on an empty stomach. But because iron can cause tummy upset (and has an unpleasant taste, besides), your doctor may suggest giving the supplement to your baby with food, breast milk, or formula. Your doctor will probably recheck your child's hemoglobin/hematocrit levels after he has been on the supplement for a month or two.It usually takes a couple of months for the blood count to return to normal, and then another six to 12 months to replenish iron stores. After that, they can probably be maintained with an iron-rich diet.Should I give my baby an iron supplement, just in case?Iron supplements are helpful in many instances, but too much iron can be poisonous, so always consult your doctor before giving your baby iron supplements. Doctors often recommend extra iron for breastfed babies starting at age 4 months. Get all the details in our expert's answer to the question ""Does my baby need an iron supplement?""If you do have iron supplements in the house (or vitamins that contain iron), make sure you keep them locked up and well out of your young child's reach. Iron is a leading cause of accidental poisoning.Show sources Hide sources Baker RD, et al. 2010.

Iron in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-in-your-pregnancy-diet_1468.bc,"Why you need iron during pregnancyEven before you're pregnant, your body needs iron for several reasons:It's essential for making hemoglobin, the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen to other cells.It's an important component of myoglobin (a protein that helps supply oxygen to your muscles), collagen (a protein in bone, cartilage, and other connective tissue), and many enzymes.It helps maintain a healthy immune system.But during pregnancy you need a lot more of this essential mineral. Here's why:The amount of blood in your body increases during pregnancy until you have almost 50 percent more blood than usual. You need extra iron to make more hemoglobin.You need extra iron for your growing baby and placenta, especially in the second and third trimesters.Many women need more because they start their pregnancy with insufficient stores of iron.Iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy is associated with preterm delivery, low birth weight, and infant mortality.How much iron you needPregnant women: 27 milligrams (mg) of iron per dayNonpregnant women: 18 mgYou don't have to get the recommended amount of iron every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Food sources of ironThere are two forms of iron: heme and non-heme. Heme iron is found only in animal sources and is easier for your body to absorb. Non-heme iron is found in plants, iron-fortified foods, and supplements. Red meat, poultry, and seafood contain both heme and non-heme iron. To make sure you're getting enough, eat a variety of iron-rich foods every day.Red meat, poultry, and fish are some of the best sources of iron. (Liver supplies a very high concentration of iron, but it also contains unsafe amounts of vitamin A, so it's best to limit it to one or two servings a month during pregnancy.) If your diet doesn't include animal protein, you can get iron from legumes, vegetables, and grains.Strawberry and asparagus salad Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 4:02Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -4:02Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Adding just a little meat or fish to a meal helps your body absorb more of the iron in the other foods on your plate.Here are a few more tips for getting as much iron as possible from your diet:Cook in a cast iron pan. Moist, acidic foods, such as tomato sauce, are especially good at soaking up iron this way.Include a source of vitamin C (like orange juice, strawberries, or broccoli) with every meal, especially when eating vegetarian sources of iron, like beans  the vitamin C can help you absorb up to six times more iron.Many healthy foods contain ""iron inhibitors,"" which are naturally occurring substances that can interfere with iron absorption. Examples of iron inhibitors include phytates in whole grains and legumes, polyphenols in coffee and tea, oxalates in soy foods and spinach, and calcium in dairy products.If you have low iron or iron-deficiency anemia, some experts believe you shouldn't eat iron-inhibiting foods at the same time as iron-rich foods. Others believe it's okay to eat these foods together as long as your overall diet includes plenty of iron-rich and vitamin C-rich foods. Your provider or a dietitian can work with you to create a prenatal nutrition plan that supports healthy iron levels.If your provider has prescribed iron supplements, take them one hour before or two hours after meals because iron is absorbed most easily on an empty stomach. Taking the supplement with orange juice  which is high in iron-enhancing vitamin C  can boost absorption. (But don't take your iron pill with milk, coffee, or tea because these can interfere with iron absorption.)Calcium also hinders iron absorption, so if your provider has recommended you take both an iron and a calcium supplement (or antacids that contain calcium), ask for advice on how to space them out during the day.Should you take an iron supplement?Although your body absorbs iron more efficiently during pregnancy, you might not get enough of the mineral from your diet. Many women start their pregnancy without enough iron to meet their body's increased demands and are unable to bring their levels up through diet alone.At your first prenatal appointment, your healthcare provider will probably recommend a prenatal vitamin with about 30 mg of iron. Unless you have (or develop) anemia, this should be sufficient, so don't take additional supplements unless your provider advises you to.What happens if you don't get enough ironWhen you don't get enough iron, your stores become depleted over time. And if you no longer have enough iron to make the hemoglobin you need, you become anemic.Iron-deficiency anemia can sap your energy and cause many other symptoms, especially if you have a severe case. It can also make it harder for your body to fight infection.It may even impact your pregnancy: Iron-deficiency anemia  especially in early or midpregnancy  has been linked to a greater risk of preterm birth, having a low-birth-weight baby, and fetal or newborn death. See our complete article on iron-deficiency anemia.If you're anemic when you give birth, you're more likely to need a transfusion and have other problems if you lose a lot of blood at delivery. And some research suggests an association between maternal iron deficiency and postpartum depression.Your baby does a good job of taking care of his iron needs while he's in your uterus. He'll get his share of what's available before you do. That said, if you're severely anemic, it may compromise your baby's iron stores at birth, raising his risk for anemia later in infancy and possibly hurting his growth and cognitive development.Can you get too much iron?Yes. Aim to get no more than 45 milligrams of iron a day. If you take more than that (either from an extra iron supplement or from your prenatal vitamin), it can cause your blood levels of iron to rise too high, possibly causing problems for you and your baby.For example, too much iron can increase your risk of developing gestational diabetes or oxidative stress, an imbalance in the body that's thought to play a role in infertility, preeclampsia, and miscarriage, and has been linked to heart disease and high blood pressure. Take iron supplements during pregnancy only under the supervision of your healthcare provider.Side effects of iron supplementsIron supplements can upset your gastrointestinal tract. The most common complaint is constipation, which is already a problem for many pregnant women. Try drinking prune juice if you're constipated. It can help you stay regular  and is actually a good source of iron!You may also have nausea or (more rarely) diarrhea. If your supplement makes you feel queasy, try taking it with a small snack or at bedtime.Talk to your provider if you're experiencing other side effects  if you're not anemic and your prenatal vitamin has more than 30 mg of iron, it may make sense for you to switch to one with a lower dose.If you are anemic, you may be able to prevent stomach problems by starting with a supplement that has less iron and gradually building up to the dose you need. You could also try taking the iron in smaller doses throughout the day. Your provider may suggest trying different iron supplements to find one that's easy on your stomach. For example, some moms-to-be have fewer side effects from a timed-release iron supplement, although the trade-off is that the iron isn't absorbed as well this way.Finally, don't worry if your stools look darker when you start taking iron. That's a normal and harmless side effect.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015. Nutrition during pregnancy.

Eating a vegetarian diet during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_eating-a-vegetarian-diet-during-pregnancy_1313874.bc,"Is it safe to eat a vegetarian diet in pregnancy?Yes. As long as you eat a variety of healthy vegetarian foods and plan your diet to include key nutrients, you can get all the nourishment you and your baby need, whether you're vegetarian or vegan. (Vegans do not eat any animal products including meat, fish, fowl, eggs, dairy, and honey.)If you're vegan, see our article on whether it's safe to eat a vegan diet during pregnancy.In some cases, you'll need to rely on fortified foods or supplements to make sure you're getting enough of what you need. Let your healthcare provider know about your diet at your preconception visit or your first prenatal visit. And always consult your doctor, midwife, or a dietitian before taking any supplements while you're pregnant.Along with a variety of fruit and vegetables (fresh, frozen, or canned) and whole grain products, you'll want to make sure you eat foods or take supplements that provide the following nutrients important for a healthy pregnancy.ProteinEat several servings of protein-rich foods each day. Good sources of vegetarian protein include eggs, dairy products, legumes, soy foods, nuts, seeds, and nut butters.Here are some ideas on how to work these foods into your diet:Add beans (such as kidney, black, or white), chickpeas, lentils, or tofu cubes to a saladHave a bean burritoSnack on a handful of almonds, walnuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, or roasted chickpeasSpread peanut or almond butter on whole grain bread or sliced applesSnack on yogurt or cottage cheeseSlice up a hard-boiled eggIronYour prenatal vitamin will likely provide some iron. But you'll also need to eat several servings of a variety of iron-rich foods every day. Good sources include:Iron-fortified breakfast cerealWhole grain or enriched foods, such as bread and pastaBeans and other legumesTofu, tempeh, and other soy-based foodsLeafy greens, such as spinach, kale, and chardAvoid having tea or coffee with your meals because these drinks contain tannins and polyphenols, which make it harder for your body to absorb iron from vegetables. Instead, have something that's rich in vitamin C, such as orange juice, tomato sauce, or broccoli, to help your body absorb the iron.You'll have a blood test early in your pregnancy to check your iron level. If yours is low, your healthcare provider may recommend that you take an iron supplement.ZincTry to get several servings of zinc-rich foods every day. Many foods that provide iron  such as fortified breakfast cereals, beans, soy foods, and whole grains  also provide zinc. Other good sources of zinc for vegetarians include nuts, seeds, wheat germ, and cheese.CalciumHave several servings of a variety of calcium-rich foods every day. Good sources include:Milk, cheese, and yogurtCalcium-fortified almond or soy milk, fruit juice, and breakfast cerealsWhite beans, blackstrap molasses, tahini, and calcium-set tofu. (To see if the tofu is calcium-set, check the list of ingredients for a calcium salt, such as calcium chloride or calcium sulfate.)Almonds or sesame seedsCertain green vegetables, including kale, collards, turnip greens, napa cabbage, broccoli, and bok choy. (Others, such as spinach, beet greens, and chard, contain calcium, but your body doesn't absorb the calcium from these vegetables as well.)Vitamin DThis vitamin helps your body absorb calcium. Cow's milk and some types of orange juice, cereal, and plant milk are fortified with vitamin D. Many prenatal supplements include vitamin D. If yours doesn't, you may want to consider taking a supplement.B12Vitamin B12 plays an important role in your baby's brain development. Eating several servings of dairy foods every day should provide you with enough, but if you are a vegetarian who limits or avoids dairy, you'll need to eat foods fortified with vitamin B12. These may include soy and other plant milks, breakfast cereals, and nutritional yeast. (Check for fortification on the product label.)If you don't eat dairy or fortified foods every day, and your prenatal supplement doesn't contain B12, you'll need to take a separate vitamin B12 supplement.IodineIodine is also important for your baby's brain development. Iodized salt, dried seaweed, cow's milk, and yogurt are good vegetarian sources of iodine. If you don't get a lot of these, check to make sure your prenatal vitamin contains iodine.DHADHA is an omega-3 fatty acid that promotes the development of your unborn baby's eyes and brain. It's found in fish, fish oil, and algae. Because it can be very difficult to obtain DHA from non-fish sources, you may want to take an omega-3 supplement derived from algae and suitable for vegetarians.NOTE: This article was reviewed by Reed Mangels, PhD, RD, LDN, adjunct associate professor in the nutrition department of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.Show sources Hide sources Foster M et al. 2015.

The main symptom was extreme fatigue, even after the tiredness had worn off from the first trimester."" Canadianmama30""My iron level was very low, and my main symptom was extreme fatigue. I'm taking iron now, but whenever I forget to take it, I become tired right away."" Momatobeto2""I was diagnosed with anemia in the first trimester. I'd come home from work and need a nap for two to three hours. I started taking ferrous sulfate pills, as the nurse suggested. After taking the pills, I had much more energy."" Kimw1219""I got really tired and just thought it was from my growing baby, but then I found out after a blood test that I was slightly anemic. I'm now taking an iron supplement and feel a million times better. The difference in energy is phenomenal!"" Babydollw2112""I'm taking an iron supplement at night and, aside from constipation, I feel better. I don't feel like I'm dragging as much during the day, and I don't feel so weak."" Jojoelovesyou""I noticed that I was super tired and a little more short of breath, so my doctor tested me and sure enough my hemoglobin level was slightly low. I'm now on one iron pill a day with my prenatal vitamin. I started to take it two weeks ago and have already seen an increase in energy."" Heatherbp26Iron supplements""It's best to take iron on an empty stomach, but eating a small snack can help with the cramps and nausea. Get stool softeners. You'll probably need to take them twice a day. Also, if you're taking a big dose of iron once a day, it can be harder on you than two to three smaller doses. Ask your doctor if you can take smaller doses instead."" FiveFamily""I take my iron pill in the morning with orange juice to help absorb it. Then I take my prenatal at night."" MrsCCincy""I have trouble remembering [to take my iron supplement]. So I take my prenatal with a meal, and then set my phone alarm before bed to take the iron pill."" 3Petites""I have mild anemia and have been taking a supplement since week 10. I was told to take it at a different time than my prenatal. So I take one in the morning and one in the evening because the calcium in the prenatal can interfere with iron absorption."" Lucky_CharmsEating well""Eat lots of leafy greens and red meat. I also put blackstrap molasses in everything (including tea and oatmeal), and I make a shake with it every day. After I started doing all that, I was able to stay awake more."" MintonMama""Try cooking in a cast iron skillet. If you make your own soups, for instance, you could saute them first in a cast iron skillet before putting them in the blender. They also make little cast-iron fish that you can put in your boiling water."" SuzannieBananie""For foods, you can't beat dark or red meat. Also try dark greens, beans, dried fruit, and iron-enriched cereal. But don't have cereal with milk because the calcium inhibits the iron absorption. Vitamin C helps, so try drinking orange juice with it instead."" A BabyCenter memberBowel issues""When you start taking iron, increase your fiber intake too because iron can cause constipation. If you do have problems, drink some prune juice!"" Babydollw2112""Iron supplements and prenatal vitamins with iron in them can cause dark brown or black stools. It looks bad, but it's a sign that they're working the way they're supposed to."" MeganmTransfusions""I was supposed to have a blood transfusion after I had my baby because my iron was too low. I refused because I didn't like the thought of it. I regretted it after leaving the hospital because I was constantly passing out. I had to have a lot more help doing things around the house and looking after my baby."" Breecc""I get iron infusions for severe anemia. The iron takes a while for my body to absorb  up to three months after each infusion. When my first infusion didn't take right away, I had a blood transfusion.

Vitamin D in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-d-in-your-pregnancy-diet_661.bc,"Why you need vitamin D during pregnancyYour body needs vitamin D to maintain proper levels ofcalciumand phosphorus, which help build your baby's bones and teeth.What happens if you don't get enough vitamin DVitamin D deficiency is common during pregnancy. Inadequate vitamin D can lead to abnormal bone growth, fractures, or rickets in newborns. Some studies link vitamin D deficiency to a higher risk of pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, preterm birth, and low birth weight, but more research is needed to confirm these links.The symptoms of a vitamin D deficiency can be subtle. They may include achy muscles, weakness, bone pain, and softened bones, which may lead to fractures.You can also have a vitamin D deficiency without any symptoms. And if that happens while you're pregnant, your baby can suffer a deficiency, too.How much vitamin D you needVitamin D dosage is a topic of debate. The Institute of Medicine currently recommends that all women  whether or not they're pregnant or breastfeeding  get 600 international units (IU) of vitamin D or 15 micrograms (mcg) each day.But many experts believe that 600 IU isn't nearly enough. The Linus Pauling Institute, for example, recommends all adults take 2,000 IU of supplemental vitamin D each day. The Endocrine Society says 600 IU may be enough, but some people  including pregnant and breastfeeding women  may need 1,500 to 2,000 IU of vitamin D.In 2015, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated that more safety research is needed before the organization would recommend more vitamin D than what's in a standard prenatal vitamin. Ask your healthcare provider for advice about how much vitamin D you need during pregnancy.Food sources of vitamin DFish liver oil, fatty fish, and eggs all contain vitamin D. But not many other foods contain vitamin D naturally, so a lot are fortified with this important vitamin. Be sure to check labels: Some cheeses, yogurts, and cereals are fortified while others aren't. (All milk is vitamin D fortified.)Here are some of the best food sources of vitamin D:3 ounces canned pink salmon: 465 IU (11.6 mcg)3 ounces canned mackerel: 211 IU (5.3 mcg)3 ounces canned sardines: 164 IU (4.1 mcg)8 ounces orange juice, fortified with vitamin D: 100 IU (2.5 mcg)8 ounces low-fat milk, fortified with vitamin D: 98 IU (2.5 mcg)1 cup cereal, fortified with vitamin D: 40 to 50 IU (1.0 to 1.3 mcg)one large egg yolk: 37 IU (0.9 mcg)Should you take a vitamin D supplement?Maybe. Most prenatal vitamins only contain 400 IU (10 mcg) of vitamin D, and it's difficult to get sufficient vitamin D from foods alone, even when you choose fortified foods.Since the skin uses the sun's rays to produce vitamin D, some experts recommend limited sun exposure, while others caution against it without the protection of sunblock and clothing. Exposure to the sun's ultraviolet [UV] rays intensifies the pigment changes that cause irregularskin darkeningin pregnant women, so most doctors recommend that pregnant women protect themselves from the sun and get their vitamin D from food or supplements.Factors that might put you at risk for a vitamin D deficiency include:Obesity. Because body fat stores much of the vitamin D made in the skin, it's less available to the body. (Vitamin D that you get from food and supplements appears to be more available to the body, so those are more reliable sources.)Darker skin. People with darker skin have a lot of melanin, which acts as a natural sunscreen and reduces production of vitamin D in the skin. Certain medications. Medications such as steroids, antiseizure medications, cholesterol-lowering drugs, and some diuretics reduce absorption of vitamin D from the intestines.Fat malabsorption conditions. Disorders such as celiac disease and Crohn's disease involve a reduced ability to absorb dietary fat, and that leads to less absorption of vitamin D.If you're worried about not getting enough vitamin D, ask your healthcare provider if you should be tested for a deficiency or if you need to take a vitamin D supplement. When choosing a supplement, look for the kind labeled vitamin D3, or cholecalciferol, which is the most effective form. (Vitamin D2, or ergocalciferol, is about 25 percent less potent.)Show sources Hide sources IOM. 1997. Dietary Reference Intakes for calcium, phosphorus, magnesium, vitamin d, and fluoride.

Calcium in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_calcium-in-your-pregnancy-diet_665.bc,"Why you need calcium during pregnancyWhen you're pregnant, your developing baby needs calcium to build strong bones and teeth. Calcium also helps your baby grow a healthy heart, nerves, and muscles as well as develop a normal heart rhythm and blood-clotting abilities.Calcium can also reduce your risk of hypertension and preeclampsia. And if you don't get enough calcium in your diet when you're pregnant, your baby will draw it from your bones, which may impair your own health later on.How much calcium you needWomen ages 19 to 50: 1,000 milligrams (mg) a day before, during, and after pregnancyWomen age 18 and younger: 1,300 mg a day before, during, and after pregnancyMost American women don't get nearly enough of this important mineral. Aim to get 3 cups of dairy products or other calcium-rich foods a day. (See our list of suggestions below.)Even after your baby's born and you're finishedbreastfeeding, continue to pay attention to your calcium intake. You'll need this mineral to strengthen bones and prevent bone loss (osteoporosis) later in life.Food sources of calciumMilk and otherdairy productsare top sources, as are canned fish and calcium-fortified cereal, juice, soy and rice beverages, and bread. Not all brands are fortified, so check labels.1 cup plain low-fat yogurt: 415 mg1.5 ounces part-skim mozzarella cheese: 333 mg3 ounces sardines (canned in oil with bone): 325 mg8 ounces low-fat fruit yogurt: 313 to 384 mg8 ounces nonfat milk: 299 mg8 ounces calcium-fortified soy milk: 299 mg8 ounces whole milk: 277 mg6 ounces calcium-fortified orange juice: 261 mg1/2 cup firm, calcium-set tofu: 253 mg3 ounces canned pink salmon, with bones and liquid: 181 mg1 cup cottage cheese (1 percent milk fat): 138 mg1/2 cup vanilla soft-serve frozen yogurt: 103 mg1 cup raw kale, chopped: 100 mg1/2 cup turnip greens, boiled: 99 mg1/2 cup vanilla ice cream: 84 mg1 cup raw bok choy, shredded: 74 mgone slice white bread: 73 mgYou may not think of water as a calcium source, but tap and bottled water typically contain varying amounts, with mineral water containing the most calcium. Check with your local water agency to find out how much calcium is in your local tap or well water.Should you take a supplement?If you're taking aprenatal vitamin, you're probably already getting at least 150 mg of calcium. You could try taking a separate calcium supplement if you aren't getting enough from your diet, but keep in mind that your body can only absorb up to 500 mg of calcium at a time. So you may need to take your supplemental calcium in smaller doses, several times a day.(You need vitamin D to absorb calcium so be sure to also get enough vitamin D in your pregnancy diet.) Supplemental calcium comes in different forms, most commonly calcium carbonate and calcium citrate.Calcium carbonate provides the most calcium, but requires extra stomach acid to help dissolve it, so it's best taken with a meal. Calcium citrate is most easily absorbed by the body. Because this type doesn't require stomach acid for absorption, it can be taken between meals. (It's a good choice for those taking heartburn medication that reduces stomach acid.)Look for a supplement with ""USP"" (for U.S. Pharmacopeia) on the label. This indicates that the supplement contains adequate calcium, will dissolve well, and is free of lead and other toxic metals. Don't take calcium supplements containing bone meal, dolomite, oyster shell, or coral  these may contain a small amount of lead, which can be harmful to your growing baby.And don't overdo it. Make sure your total tally from food, supplements, and water doesn't exceed 2,500 mg (or 3,000 mg if you're younger than 18). Too much calcium can cause constipation, increase your risk of kidney stones, and might hinder your body's absorption of iron and zinc from foods.

Iron-deficiency anemia and breastfeeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-deficiency-anemia-and-breastfeeding_10414725.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI have iron-deficiency anemia. Can I breastfeed?Yes. Breastfeeding is good for you and your baby, even if when you have iron-deficiency anemia. If you want to breastfeed your baby, you can do so safely.It's true that you lose iron through breast milk, but if you breastfeed exclusively, it's unlikely that you'll get your period for four to six months. And not losing iron through your menstrual blood helps your iron stores stay balanced.Are iron supplements necessary if I'm breastfeeding?If you had anemia during pregnancy, check with your healthcare provider to see if you need to continue taking iron supplements when breastfeeding.Iron supplements are perfectly safe to take when you're breastfeeding. For breastfeeding women, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for iron is 9 milligrams (mg) per day.If you lost a lot of blood during birth from a postpartum hemorrhage, you may have your hemoglobin level tested after birth. The test assesses the severity of your anemia and whether you still need to take an iron supplement. It's possible you may need a transfusion.If you're worried about your iron level (if you feel extremely tired, for example), ask your provider to give you a blood test. If you're anemic, she's likely to recommend more iron supplements.What are alternatives to breastfeeding?If you're not able to breastfeed (or choose not to), it's still important to ensure that your baby gets enough iron. Choose iron-fortified formula so your baby gets the right amount of iron from day one.Don't give your baby cow's milk before the age of 1 because it's very low in iron. After age 1, limit the amount of cow's milk you give your child to no more than 24 ounces daily.Will my baby need an iron supplement?If your baby was born prematurely or had a low birth weight, then she probably won't have as much iron stored in her body as a larger or full-term infant. If this is the case, she may need iron drops. Follow your healthcare provider's advice about how much iron to give your baby, and keep iron drops out of your baby's reach.If you've had anemia, it's understandable to worry that your baby will be low in iron too, but that's not necessarily the case. Feeding her breast milk, which is naturally rich in iron, or iron-fortified formula, will give her the best start in life.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources CDC. 1998.

Iron-deficiency anemia: What are the long-term implications?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-deficiency-anemia-what-are-the-long-term-implications_10414726.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWill anemia go away when my baby is born?That depends on the person. Each woman is different.For many women, anemia goes away by the end of pregnancy. These women may have mild anemia and take iron supplements throughout pregnancy, helping iron levels return to normal by the time their baby arrives. For other women, it takes six months to rebuild iron stores after having anemia.Check with your provider if you're unsure whether your anemia has resolved, or if you wonder whether you should still take iron supplements. If you do take them, iron supplements are considered safe to take when breastfeeding.But be aware that breastfeeding women need only 9 milligrams (mg) of iron daily (compared with 27 mg during pregnancy).What else might make me feel better?Every new mom is exhausted, but tiredness is also a key symptom of anemia. Eating plenty of iron-rich foods and taking a supplement if necessary can boost your energy and lessen fatigue.If you lose a lot of blood giving birth, then your hemoglobin level may be tested after you have your baby. If your iron level is extremely low and doesn't improve after taking iron supplements, your provider may refer you to a hematologist or another specialist for further evaluation. It's possible you may need an intravenous iron infusion.If your anemia is very severe, your provider may also recommend a blood transfusion to raise your iron levelsWill anemia have any long-term effects on me?There isn't much research showing any long-term effects of anemia on women. A few studies suggest an increased risk of developing postpartum depression (PPD) after having anemia during pregnancy. However, the link between the two conditions isn't clear.And many women  including those without anemia  are diagnosed with PPD. In any case, watch out for the symptoms of PPD, which can include feeling weepy and anxious. You may also lose your appetite or have trouble sleeping.If you recognize these symptoms in yourself and they don't go away after a week or two, don't suffer in silence. Talk to your provider about how youre feeling so she can help you get the help and support you need.Will anemia affect my baby in the long term?Your baby is unlikely to be affected if your anemia is mild or you receive treatment for it. In the case of severe, untreated anemia, the truth is that experts aren't sure.Some studies have suggested that severe anemia during pregnancy could affect a baby's physical and mental development. There is also a possible link between severe IDA in infants and children and behavioral problems. However, only a few small studies have been done on this topic, and more research is needed.There are studies showing that when a woman has severe anemia in the first two trimesters of her pregnancy, there's an increased risk of her baby having a low birth weight or being born prematurely. And that can certainly impact a baby's long-term development.What can I do to minimize the risk for future pregnancies?Leaving a short gap between pregnancies puts you at greater risk for anemia. So if you're planning to have another baby, wait at least 18 months before conceiving again. In the meantime, get into the habit of incorporating more iron-rich foods into what you eat.If you know you have iron-deficiency anemia before becoming pregnant, see your provider for a preconception checkup so she can manage your condition and treat you before you get pregnant. And if you develop anemia once you're pregnant, minimize the risks to you and your baby by taking iron supplements.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

Folic acid: Why you need it before and during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_folic-acid-why-you-need-it-before-and-during-pregnancy_476.bc,"Why you need folic acidIf you're pregnant or might become pregnant, it's critically important to get enough folic acid, the synthetic form of vitamin B9, also known as folate.Folic acid helps prevent neural tube defects (NTDs)  serious birth defects of the spinal cord (such as spina bifida) and the brain (such as anencephaly). The neural tube is the part of the embryo from which your baby's spine and brain develop. NTDs affect about 3,000 pregnancies a year in the United States.Neural tube defects occur at a very early stage of development, before many women even know they're pregnant  which is why it's important to begin taking folic acid before you start trying to conceive.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that women who take the recommended daily dose of folic acid starting at least one month before conception and during the first trimester of pregnancy reduce their baby's risk of neural tube defects by up to 70 percent.Some research suggests that folic acid may help lower your baby's risk of other defects as well, such as cleft lip, cleft palate, and certain types of heart defects. It may also reduce your risk of preeclampsia, a serious blood pressure disorder that affects about 5 percent of pregnant women.What else does folic acid do for you? Your body needs this nutrient to make normal red blood cells and prevent a type of anemia. It's also essential for the production, repair, and functioning of DNA, our genetic map and a basic building block of cells. Getting enough folic acid is particularly important for the rapid cell growth of the placenta and your developing baby.What does your OB-GYN want you to know before getting pregnant?

See all videosHow much folic acid you needTo reduce your baby's risk of developing a neural tube defect, experts recommend that you take 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid a day, beginning at least a month before you start trying to get pregnant.In fact, because half of the pregnancies in the United States are unplanned, the CDC, the U.S. Public Health Service, the March of Dimes, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), and other experts strongly recommend that all women of childbearing age get 400 mcg of folic acid every day.Some groups, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health, suggest boosting your intake to at least 600 mcg daily once you're pregnant.Check the label of your multivitamin supplement to be sure you're getting enough. If you're not, you can switch brands or take folic acid separately. (Never take more than one multivitamin a day.)If you're taking prescription prenatal vitamins, they probably contain 800 to 1,000 mcg of folic acid. Again, check the label.Don't take more than 1,000 mcg per day of folic acid unless your healthcare provider advises you to. This is particularly important if you are a vegan. Vegans are at risk of being deficient in vitamin B12 and taking too much folic acid would make it hard to diagnose that deficiency. When you might need extra folic acidWomen who are obese appear to be more likely to have a baby with a neural tube defect. If you're significantly overweight, see your healthcare provider before you try to conceive. She may advise you to take more than 400 mcg of folic acid a day.If you've previously been pregnant with a baby with a neural tube defect, you'll probably be advised to take 4,000 mcg of folic acid a day. Be sure your current providers are aware of your history and schedule a visit before you try to get pregnant. With no intervention, women in this situation have a 3 to 5 percent chance of having another pregnancy complicated by an NTD.Are you pregnant?Take our quiz and find outIf you're carrying twins, your healthcare provider may recommend you take as much as 1,000 mcg of folic acid per day.Some people have a genetic variation  known as a methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) mutation  that makes it more difficult to process folate and folic acid. If you know you have this mutation, talk with your doctor to make sure you're getting enough folic acid.Women who are diabetic or are taking certain antiseizure medications are also more likely to have a baby with an NTD. If either of these situations applies to you, see your provider at least a month before trying to conceive to find out how much folic acid you should be taking and to monitor your condition in general.Food sources of folic acidFood manufacturers are required by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to add folic acid to enriched grain products, such as breakfast cereals, bread, pasta, and rice. Some fortified breakfast cereals contain 100 percent of the recommended daily amount.This is meant to be helpful for women who don't take a supplement and aren't planning to get pregnant, but most women don't eat these foods consistently enough to rely on them as a source of folic acid.Even if you eat a complete serving of a fully fortified cereal every day, you can't be sure you're getting what you need. (For one thing, synthetic nutrients added to cereals tend to end up in the milk at the bottom of the bowl.)Foods that are naturally rich in folate are not a good source either. Oddly enough, research shows that the body absorbs folic acid from supplements much better than the folate that occurs naturally in certain foods. What's more, folate can be lost from foods during storage or destroyed by cooking.So if you eat foods rich in folate, consider them a complement to your supplement. Good sources include:lentilsdried beans, peas, and nutsavocadodark green vegetables such as broccoli, spinach, collard or turnip greens, okra, Brussels sprouts, and asparaguscitrus fruit and juice Is a supplement recommended?Yes. As mentioned above, many authorities, including ACOG and the March of Dimes, recommend that all women of childbearing age take a multivitamin with folic acid or a folic acid supplement every single day.Signs of a folic acid deficiencyThe signs of folic acid deficiency can be subtle. You may have diarrhea, anemia, loss of appetite, and weight loss, as well as weakness, a sore tongue, headaches, heart palpitations, and irritability.If you're only mildly deficient, you may not notice any symptoms at all, but you won't be getting the optimal amount for your baby's early embryonic development.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 1999.

Should your kids eat fish: How they can avoid mercury and still get their omega-3s,https://www.babycenter.com/0_should-your-kids-eat-fish-how-they-can-avoid-mercury-and-sti_10319857.bc,"Should my child eat fish?Many parents struggle with this question. The answer is yes, but you'll want to choose their fish carefully.Studies show that fish provide an array of nutrients that are important for your child's development. Most experts agree that the key nutrients are two omega-3 fatty acids  DHA and EPA  that are difficult to find in other foods. Fish is also low in saturated fat and high in protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients.On the other hand, you've probably heard that fish contain contaminants such as mercury, which can harm a child's developing brain and nervous system.Most experts agree that children should eat some fish. In fact, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that children 2 to 8 years old eat 3 to 6 ounces of fish per week, and that children 9 years old and older eat 8 to 10 ounces per week. But it can be hard to figure out which fish are best.Here are some guidelines to help you limit your child's exposure to mercury while making sure she gets the nutrients she needs.How does mercury get into fish?Mercury is everywhere, even in the air we breathe.Some of the sources (such as volcanoes and forest fires) are natural. It's also released into the air by power plants, cement plants, and certain chemical and industrial manufacturers.And mercury has been used for decades in making thermometers, thermostats, fluorescent lights, and many other products. When these items end up in a landfill, the mercury may be released.When mercury settles into water, bacteria convert it into a form called methylmercury. Fish absorb methylmercury from the water they swim in and the organisms they eat. Methylmercury binds tightly to the proteins in fish muscle and remains there even after the fish is cooked.What could happen if my child eats fish that's high in mercury?The body easily absorbs methylmercury from fish.Studies show that exposure to even low doses of methylmercury can affect the brain and nervous system. Babies (including those in utero) and young children are most vulnerable to high levels of methylmercury because their brains and nervous systems are still developing.Why not just take fish off my child's menu?Fish is too good a nutritional choice  especially during early childhood. Studies have shown that getting enough omega-3s during infancy (either through breastfeeding or supplemented formula) has a positive effect on a child's vision and cognitive development.Which fish are best to eat?Good choices include salmon, trout, anchovies, herring, sardines, and shad.Purdue University publishes a handy wallet card that tells you where most commercial fish falls on the mercury contamination scale and how much of each it's okay to eat.Purdue also has free iPhone/iPod apps that can help you track your seafood consumption and estimate your intake of omega-3s, mercury, and PCBs, a group of industrial pollutants that can harm your baby's nervous system.Which fish should I avoid altogether?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EPA advise women of childbearing age and young children not to eat four high-mercury species: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico.Other experts and advocacy groups would like to expand this list. Purdue University toxicologist Charles Santerre recommends that you also avoid eating all fresh or frozen tuna, striped bass, bluefish, Chilean sea bass, golden snapper, marlin, orange roughy, amberjack, Crevalle jack, Spanish mackerel from the Gulf of Mexico, and walleye from the Great Lakes.He also recommends not eating striped bass and bluefish, which can be high in mercury and PCBs.What about canned tuna?There's some disagreement when it comes to canned tuna.The FDA recommends that children eat no more than two servings a week of canned ""chunk light"" tuna and no more than one serving a week of canned ""solid white"" or albacore tuna. That's because albacore tuna comes from large fish that tend to contain more mercury.Other experts, like Edward Groth, an independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, recommend that you avoid serving canned tuna entirely. Groth points out that canned tuna is by far the largest source of methylmercury in the American diet.What about fish caught in local waters?Check advisories from your state or local health and environmental agencies to figure out which fish to avoid and how much of each type it's safe to eat.These advisories are usually indicated on signposts in fishing areas. You can also access your state's advisories on this map, which is kept up-to-date by Purdue University.If you don't find an advisory for local fish, the EPA recommends limiting your child to one serving per week and not serving her any other fish that week.What can my child eat, other than fish, to get omega-3s?It's not easy to find DHA and EPA in other foods.Many foods  such as eggs, milk, soy beverages, juice, yogurt, bread, and cereal  are now fortified with omega-3s, but most of these contain only ALA. ALA is an omega-3 that provides some health benefits, but not the same ones you get from DHA and EPA. (Most food labels don't specify the type of omega-3.)You may have heard that flaxseed is a good source of omega 3s, but it does not provide DHA or EPA. The only omega-3 fatty acid in plant foods is ALA.What about omega-3 supplements?""In general, it's better to get specific nutrients from food than supplements,"" says Keli Hawthorne, a registered dietitian in the pediatrics department at the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at Austin. That way your child will benefit from other nutrients in the foods at the same time. Also, we don't have conclusive evidence that these supplements provide the same significant benefits as eating fish.Still, if you find that your child isn't eating enough foods that contain omega-3s, you might want to talk with her healthcare provider about giving her a supplement.Omega-3 supplements provide EPA and DHA and are mercury-free. Many contain fish oil, but mercury is not stored in fatty tissue, so it's not in the oil, although PCBs may be.These supplements come in liquid, soft chews, and soft gel form, and some are flavored to mask the fishy taste. If you give your child a flavored variety, be sure to store the container out of reach (so she doesn't eat them like candy).How much omega-3s should my child get each day?The Food and Nutrition Board (the group that sets the recommended daily intake levels for nutrients) has not set recommended levels for DHA or EPA.Your child's healthcare provider can recommend specific amounts (based on your child's diet and any other supplements she may be taking) and perhaps brands.How can I find out how much mercury my child has in her body?It's simple to test for mercury in your child's blood or in a hair sample, but testing is not routinely recommended. Following the guidelines above for amounts and types of fish to eat should help keep your child's mercury levels in a safe range.If your child eats fish more often than recommended and you're concerned, talk with your healthcare provider about having a test done. If your child's levels indicate that she's getting too much mercury, your provider or a dietitian can help you change her diet accordingly.This article was reviewed by:Edward Groth, Ph.D., independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazineKeli Hawthorne, M.S., R.D., L.D., director for clinical research for the Department of Pediatrics at the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at AustinCharles R.

Your pregnancy diet: The basics of eating well,https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-eating-well,"Fine-tune your diet  even if you already eat wellAlmost all pregnant women need to get more protein, more of certain vitamins and minerals (such as folic acid and iron), and more calories (for energy). If there's room for improvement in your diet, eating highly nutritious meals is one of the best things you can do for your baby's health.But eating better doesn't mean eating a lot. If you start off at a healthy weight, you don't need additional calories during the first trimester. In the second trimester, you need about 340 extra calories a day and about 450 extra calories a day in the third trimester. If you're underweight or overweight to start, you'll need more or less than this, depending on your weight gain goal.Learn more: Find out the best ways to eat for two and get the calories you need.Skip unsafe foodsSome foods can be dangerous when you're pregnant. Steer clear of these foods:Raw seafood (such as oysters or uncooked sushi)Unpasteurized milk (and cheese made from unpasteurized milk)Soft cheese (such as Brie or Camembert)Mexican cheese (like queso blanco and panela)PtRaw or undercooked meat and poultryAll of these are possible sources of bacteria that can be harmful to an unborn child.Learn more: Find out how to avoid listeriosis, a foodborne illness that's especially dangerous during pregnancy. Pregnancy weight gain trackerSee your target weight range for pregnancy and whether your weight gain is on track.Say no to alcoholYou'll need to give up cocktails, too. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause physical defects, learning disabilities, and emotional problems in children, so many experts recommend that you give up alcohol for your entire pregnancy.Learn more: Discover your favorite nonalcoholic alternative from our list of the best virgin drinks.Limit caffeineCaffeine is another consideration. Aim to get less than 200 milligrams (mg) per day (about 12 ounces of coffee). Some studies suggest a link between higher amounts of caffeine and miscarriage or lower birth weight, but this hasn't been confirmed. Just in case, stick to decaffeinated tea and sodas, or choose healthier drinks, such as skim milk, 100 percent fruit juice, or water with a squeeze of lemon.Learn more: Be informed about caffeine during pregnancy and see how much caffeine there is in common beverages and foods.Go easy on fishNearly all fish contain traces of methylmercury, a metal believed to be harmful in high doses to the growing brains of fetuses and young children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends limiting your consumption of fish to 12 ounces a week, which is the equivalent of about two servings.Learn more: Get the facts about eating fish during pregnancy and find answers to all your food safety questions.Take a prenatal vitaminEven without morning sickness or food aversions, it's difficult to meet your nutritional needs with just a well-balanced diet. A prenatal vitamin-mineral supplement helps you get the nutrients you and your baby need to thrive.Make sure the prenatal vitamin you choose contains folic acid. (You need 400 mcg daily before you become pregnant and in early pregnancy. Some groups, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health, suggest boosting your intake to at least 600 mcg once you're pregnant.) Not getting enough folic acid has been linked to neural tube birth defects (NTDs), such as spina bifida. Ask your healthcare provider if you need to take other supplementsCholine is another important nutrient that researchers now believe may help prevent NTDs. You need 450 mg of choline a day during pregnancy. Most prenatal vitamins don't contain it, so you'll have to get it from food or ask your healthcare provider about taking a choline supplement.Later in your pregnancy your provider may suggest that you take iron or calcium supplements to make sure you're getting enough of these key minerals. Some experts also recommend taking a vitamin D supplement throughout pregnancy.If you're a strict vegetarian, have a medical condition such as diabetes, gestational diabetes, or anemia, or have previously delivered a low-birth-weight baby, talk with your healthcare provider about other supplements you might need. A registered dietitian can also help with diet specifics.If you have trouble swallowing your vitamins or keeping them down, search for a chewable supplement or one in a powdered form that you can mix with water. And keep in mind that more isn't always better: Don't take megadoses of any vitamin, mineral, or herbal supplement without medical supervision  they could harm your developing baby.Learn more: See our chart of nutrients you need to help your baby grow.Don't diet while you're pregnantDieting during pregnancy could be harmful to you and your baby. Many eating plans designed for weight loss would leave you low not only on calories, but also on iron, folic acid, and other important vitamins and minerals.Weight gain is one of the most positive signs of a healthy pregnancy. Women who eat well and gain the& appropriate amount of weight are more likely to have healthy babies. If you're eating wholesome foods and slowly adding pounds, you can rest assured things are most likely on track.Keep in mind that when you put on your pregnancy weight may be as important as how much you gain. Healthcare providers recommend that you gain the least weight during the first trimester  roughly 1 to 5 pounds  and then gain roughly a pound a week in the second and third trimesters. (Talk with your provider if you're carrying twins or if you're underweight or overweight at the start of pregnancy  your recommended rate of weight gain might be different.)Learn more: Find out what eating for two really means. Eat small meals frequentlyIt's fine to get creative with your eating schedule during pregnancy. If nausea, food aversions, heartburn, or indigestion make eating full-size meals uncomfortable, try eating small, frequent meals throughout the day. As your pregnancy progresses and your baby increasingly crowds your stomach and other digestive organs, you'll have less space in your body for big meals anyway.If you're most hungry when it's not typically time to eat, go ahead and have your meal when the feeling strikes. Eating in a pattern that works for you will help you meet your nutritional needs during pregnancy.(Snacks in between meals are fine, but make healthy choices as often as you can  junk food offers little more than empty calories.)Learn more: Create a pregnancy meal plan you can live with.Treat yourself to something sweet on occasionAvoid making processed foods, packaged snacks, and sugary desserts the mainstay of your diet, but you don't have to give up all your favorite goodies just because you're pregnant. Try smart and tasty alternatives such as a banana smoothie, frozen all-fruit nonfat sorbet, or trail mix.And don't beat yourself up if you cave in to temptation now and again. The occasional cookie or piece of cake won't do any harm.11 foods to avoid during pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:23Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:23Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Your pregnancy: 13 weeks,https://www.babycenter.com/6_your-pregnancy-13-weeks_1102.bc,
Choosing to formula-feed,https://www.babycenter.com/0_choosing-to-formula-feed_471.bc,"I want to formula-feed my baby, but everybody says it's better to breastfeed. Is this true?Both formula feeding and breastfeeding are valid, healthy choices for your baby. The decision to do one or the other  or a combination of both  is purely personal and depends on what's right for your family and circumstances.Breast milk gives your baby the best possible nutrition, protects against infection, and even adjusts to meet your infant's nutritional needs (something formula can't do). You benefit too: Breastfeeding helps you bond with your baby, and research suggests it may even lower your risk of ovarian and breast cancers.If possible, you may want to try nursing, at least for the first month, so your natural immunities can be passed to your child.Or, consider a combination of breastfeeding and formula feeding. If you're nursing, it's okay to give your baby formula once a day as long as your breast milk supply is well established, which usually happens within a month of giving birth. Some women supplement this way because formula feeding gives them a break (especially in the middle of the night) and lets their partner help feed the baby.That said, exclusive formula feeding  either right from the start or after a period of nursing  is also a healthy way to feed your baby. Formula even has some vitamins and other nutrients that breastfed babies have to get from supplements, like vitamin D.If you're concerned about your choice, try to separate the medical facts from the political and cultural rhetoric. Your child's doctor will work with you to make sure your baby is getting all the nutrients she needs and chart her growth to make sure she's growing well. In the end, the most important thing you can do for your baby is love and nurture her  and that includes feeding her whichever way you choose.There are plenty of reasons women choose to formula-feed. Among them are having a baby with a poor sucking reflex (common in premature babies), prolonged mother-infant separation, painful nursing, the fear that your baby isn't getting enough milk, the need to return to work, a health problem that requires medication that's not safe for a nursing infant, and a desire to let other family members help feed the baby.Which type of formula should I use?Most formulas are made from cow's milk or soybeans. There are also specialized formulas for babies who are allergic to milk or soy proteins, and for babies who are premature or have a low birth weight. Any formula you choose should be iron-fortified to prevent anemia. To find out more about choosing the right formula for your baby, see our article and talk to your baby's doctor.Why can't I just feed my baby cow's milk?Never feed your infant cow's milk. It's just not recommended until after your baby's first birthday because it doesn't have the proper nutrients in the right proportions for a growing infant. It can also cause digestive trouble.Find out more about when to transition your child to regular cow's milk and how to make the switch.What are follow-up formulas, and should I switch to one?Follow-up formulas are specifically designed for babies 4 to 12 months old who are already eating some solids. Follow-up formulas contain more calcium, iron, protein, and calories than infant formulas.Most babies don't need follow-up formula. Doctors encourage parents to introduce solid food (baby cereal, pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables) to their babies at 4 to 6 months, rather than fill them up with formula.Still, it depends on the individual child. Babies with food allergies, those who are very sensitive to different foods, and those with a history of poor growth may benefit from follow-up formula. Talk to your doctor about what's best for your baby.I'd like to supplement breast milk with formula. How should I do it?Lactation consultants suggest waiting to introduce a bottle until the baby is 4 weeks old. By then, breastfeeding is usually well established, but your baby's not yet likely to resist a new kind of nipple. (Nursing and taking a bottle require different types of sucking.)It's best to have someone else give the first bottle because your baby can smell you and your milk and may refuse to take a bottle if you're nearby.If you plan to use formula for occasional feedings, don't offer more than one bottle every 24 hours. Otherwise, your milk production could slow down. If you're returning to work soon and plan to have your caregiver give your baby formula while you're away and nurse when you're home, ease into it by replacing one feeding with a bottle every three to four days.Get more tips on supplementing with formula.Show sources Hide sources AAP.

Iron in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-in-your-childs-diet_10324691.bc,"Iron is crucial for children's health and development. Read on to find out how much iron your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for childrenWhy iron is importantIron is important for making hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying red pigment in blood, and myoglobin, a pigment that stores oxygen in muscles. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in the United States, and a lack of iron can causeanemia, resulting in fatigue and weakness.Iron also affects brain development, so anemia can also cause long-lasting problems with cognitive development. A severe iron deficiency can be life-threatening.How much iron does your child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 7 milligrams (mg) per dayAges 4 to 8 years: 10 mg dailyIf your child eats a vegetarian diet, aim for twice as much iron because iron from nonanimal sources is harder for the body to absorb.Your child doesn't have to get enough iron every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Child Height PredictorFind out how tall your child is likely to be at age 18.Animal sources and plant sources of iron: What's the difference?Heme iron  the kind you get from animal sources such as meat, seafood, and poultry  is easily absorbed by the body. The body needs help to absorb nonheme iron, which is the kind found in nonanimal sources like dark green leafy vegetables, legumes, fortified bread and grains, and dried fruit. (Egg yolks contain mostly nonheme iron.)You can increase the amount of nonheme iron the body absorbs by serving it with foods that contain heme iron or with foods rich in vitamin C, such as orange juice, oranges, strawberries, red and green bell peppers, papaya, broccoli, grapefruit, cantaloupe, tomatoes, broccoli, mangoes, and sweet potatoes.This is especially important for children eating vegetarian diets: They need to focus on eating plenty of iron-rich foods with foods high in vitamin C to boost absorption.Good sources of ironIron can be found in a variety of foods. Here are some good sources:1/2 cup fortified, ready-to-eat cereal: 12 mg1/2 cup fortified oatmeal, prepared with water: 5 mg1/4 cup raw tofu: 2.22 mg (The iron content of tofu varies by type, so check the label.)1/4 cup soybeans: 2 mg1/4 cup boiled lentils: 2 mg1/4 cup baked beans with pork and tomato sauce: 2 mg1/4 cup navy beans: 1 mg1/4 cup kidney beans: 1 mg1 ounce braised lean beef, chuck: 1 mg1 teaspoon blackstrap molasses: 1 mg1/2 medium broiled hamburger (1.5 oz.), 95 percent lean: 1 mg1/4 cup garbanzo beans: 1 mg1/4 cup cooked frozen spinach: 0.9 mg1/4 cup black beans: 0.9 mg1/4 cup pinto beans: 0.9 mgOne slice whole wheat bread: 0.9 mg1/4 cup raisins: 0.7 mgThe amount of iron in a food varies somewhat, depending on brand of the product or the cut of the meat. Note that raisins and other chunky foods (like beans) are choking hazards for very young children. Mash or cut these foods into small pieces.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts of food shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can your child get too much iron?Yes. Although it's essentially impossible to get too much iron from food, supplements are another matter. Excessive iron from supplements can be toxic to children, causing serious health problems or even death. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) for iron is 40 mg per day for children age 13 and younger. That's the maximum amount considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine.If you're concerned that your child isn't getting enough iron, talk to his doctor before giving your child a supplement.And always keep iron supplements locked up and out of sight  it's easy for curious little hands to get into medicine and supplements when you're not looking. And never encourage kids to take chewable vitamins as a ""treat,"" or they may take them when you're not looking.Show sources Hide sources IOM. 2001.

Probiotics for children,https://www.babycenter.com/0_probiotics-for-children_10401185.bc,"What are probiotics?Probiotics are live microorganisms, such as bacteria or yeast, that have beneficial effects on human health. They are available as supplements and in certain foods, such as some kinds of yogurt.Your digestive system hosts trillions of microorganisms, mostly bacteria. Some are considered harmful and some helpful, and ideally they exist in balance with one another. When the balance between them is disturbed and there are too many ""bad"" bacteria,it may cause diarrhea, bloating, gas, or even chronic conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome (IBS).Certain illnesses  or taking antibiotics, which can wipe out both good and bad bacteria  can upset the balance of bacteria in the intestine. Over time, the body usually restores this balance without aid. But studies show that taking probiotics can sometimes help with this process and may prevent or ease certain symptoms or health problems.What ailments can probiotics help treat or prevent in children?Research on the benefits of probiotics is ongoing. Here's what we know so far about how probiotics might help children: There's strong evidence that probiotics can help prevent and treat diarrhea caused by infection or from taking antibiotics. One study showed that giving young children certain probiotics when they first started having diarrhea from a stomach virus shortened the course of illness by one day. Some studies show probiotics may be useful in helping to reduce symptoms of IBS. There's some evidence that probiotics may help treat inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Researchers have found some evidence that taking probiotics regularly may help improve a child's tolerance of lactose (a sugar found in cow's milk). Also, taking probiotics with dairy may help a child who is lactose intolerant digest that food. A few studies have shown that taking certain probiotics may help prevent upper respiratory infections such as colds, especially in children in daycare. The research so far is inconsistent, however.Researchers are also studying the use of probiotics in children to prevent or treat eczema, reduce tooth decay, and help prevent allergies.How can I tell what kind of probiotics may help my child?Probiotic supplements come in many forms, including chewables, powders, drops, tablets, and capsules. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate probiotics in supplements (or foods) though, so it's often difficult to know what you're getting. (See our article on buying supplements for guidance.)If you want to explore the use of probiotics to help your child (because he has diarrhea or IBS, for example), talk with his healthcare provider about giving them a trial. She'll need to screen him to make sure his symptoms aren't due to a more serious illness and make sure that probiotics would be safe for him. It's especially important to check in with the doctor before giving your child probiotics if your child has a compromised immune system.Your child's healthcare provider can also help you figure out which specific probiotic might be helpful. For example, Lactobacillus rhamnosus and Saccharomyces cerevisiae var. boulardii have been shown in clinical trials to prevent infectious diarrhea. She can also tell you what dosages to try. More isn't necessarily better when it comes to probiotics.To ensure maximum effectiveness, store the probiotics according to the directions on the label. Some require refrigeration.In general, it's best to give your child probiotics on a full stomach. (When his stomach is empty, stomach acids may kill the microorganisms.) If your child can't swallow pills, try chewables, or use drops or powder and add them to a flavorful food or drink to disguise the taste.What are some food sources of probiotics?Yogurt, which naturally contains the bacteria Lactobacillus, is the most commonly cited food source of probiotics. In some yogurts, however, the live bacteria have been killed during processing. Make sure you choose one labeled ""contains live active cultures"" or something similar. Many common yogurts, particularly kids' products, do not contain live cultures.Other foods that naturally contain active bacterial cultures include kefir, soft-fermented cheeses, cultured cottage cheese, buttermilk, sauerkraut, miso soup, kimchi (a pickled cabbage), tempeh, sour pickles, and kombucha tea. Studies have not been done on these foods to determine their health benefits as probiotics, however.Giving your child a daily serving of yogurt or another probiotic-containing food won't hurt and may even help especially if she's lactose intolerant, having diarrhea, or prone to gastrointestinal problems.Note that because probiotics are increasingly popular, manufacturers now add them to foods such as juices, cereals, and snack bars and advertise this on the labels. Some of these foods may contain active cultures, but there's no way to know if they'll have any effect.What are prebiotics and synbiotics?Prebiotics are ingredients in foods that stimulate the growth of good bacteria already in the colon. These include dietary fiber and fructo-oligosaccharides. Dietary fiber is found in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. Fructo-oligosaccharides are found in foods like honey, onion, asparagus, banana, rye, maple syrup, and oats.Synbiotics are combinations of probiotics and prebiotics (such as Lactobacillus and oligosaccharides). They're available as supplements and are also now added to some infant formulas. As with probiotics and prebiotics, experts are still determining how best to use them for healthcare.Editor's note: This article was reviewed by Dan Merenstein, director of research programs in the department of family medicine at Georgetown University Medical Center and the coauthor of a 2014 expert consensus document on probiotics and prebiotics."
Vitamin A in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-a-in-your-pregnancy-diet_675.bc,"Why you need vitamin A during pregnancyVitamin A is a fat-soluble vitamin that's stored in the liver. Vitamin A is important for your baby's embryonic growth, including the development of the heart, lungs, kidneys, eyes, and bones as well as the circulatory, respiratory, and central nervous systems.Vitamin A is particularly essential for women who are about to give birth because it helps with postpartum tissue repair. It also helps maintain normal vision, fights infections, supports your immune system, and helps with fat metabolism.Understanding vitamin AThere are two types of the nutrient: preformed vitamin A and provitamin A carotenoids. Preformed vitamin A (also called retinol) is used directly by the body and is found in animal products like eggs, milk, and liver. Provitamin A carotenoids are found in fruits and vegetables, but your body must convert this type into retinol.More than 600 carotenoids are found in nature, but only a few can be converted to retinol. Beta-carotene is the most common one.The standard of measurement for vitamin A is RAE (retinol activity equivalents), which is based on the potency and source of vitamin A. One microgram (mcg) of retinol (preformed vitamin A) is equal to 1 mcg RAE, but it takes 12 mcg of beta-carotene or 24 mcg of alpha-carotene to equal 1 mcg RAE.An older standard of measurement that is still used (especially on Supplement Facts labels) is the International Unit, or IU. IUs aren't easily converted to RAE because the conversion depends on the type of vitamin A. For example, 900 mcg RAE could be anywhere from 6,000 to 36,100 IU of vitamin A.How much vitamin A you needPregnant women age 18 and younger: 750 mcg RAE per dayPregnant women age 19 and older: 770 micrograms RAE per dayBreastfeeding women age 18 and younger: 1,200 mcg RAE per dayBreastfeeding women age 19 and older: 1,300 mcg RAE per dayNonpregnant women: 700 mcg RAE per dayYou don't have to get the recommended amount of vitamin A every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week. Can you get too much vitamin A?The average American diet provides plenty of vitamin A. It's available in meat, dairy, fish, eggs, and fortified cereals in the form of preformed vitamin A, or retinol. It's also in most fruits and vegetables, mostly in the form of carotenoids.During pregnancy, it's important not to get too much preformed vitamin A, which can cause birth defects and liver toxicity in high doses. (However, you can get as many carotenoids as you want from fruits and vegetables.)Women age 19 and older  whether or not they're pregnant or breastfeeding  should get no more than 3,000 mcg RAE (or 10,000 IU) of preformed vitamin A from supplements, animal sources, and fortified foods each day. For women age 18 and younger, the upper intake limit is 2,800 mcg RAE (9,333 IU).This is one important reason why it's not a good idea to double up on your prenatal vitamins or take any supplements that your practitioner doesn't recommend. Most prenatal vitamins contain at least part of their vitamin A in the form of beta-carotene, but some over-the-counter brands, other kinds of multivitamins, and some fortified foods contain significant amounts of preformed vitamin A. Always check a product's label or show all supplements to your practitioner before taking them.One more thing: The risk of birth defects from getting too much vitamin A is the reason that pregnant women and those trying to conceive should stay away from the prescription acne drug isotretinoin (also known by the brand nameAccutane, among others) and other drugs related to retinol (a compound of vitamin A), including topical tretinoin (Retin-A), which is used for skin conditions.Food sources of vitamin AFruits and vegetables(particularly orange and yellow ones and leafy greens), rich in beta-carotene, are the best sources of vitamin A. You're also likely to get a fair amount of preformed vitamin A from fortified milk and cereals.Liver (from beef, veal, or chicken, for example, and including pts and liverwurst) contains the highest amounts of preformed vitamin A  so much that you should limit it to once or twice a month during pregnancy to be sure that you don't get too much at once. A 3-ounce serving of beef liver can contain more than eight times the recommended daily amount of vitamin A during pregnancy  more than twice the amount that's safe to consume in one day!Here are some good food sources of vitamin A:one medium baked sweet potato: 961 mcg RAE (19,218 IU)1/2 cup canned pumpkin: 953 mcg RAE (19,065 IU)1/2 cup butternut squash, cooked: 572 mcg RAE (11,434 IU)1/2 cup canned sweet potato, mashed: 555 mcg RAE (11,091 IU)1/2 cup raw carrot, chopped: 534 mcg RAE (10,692 IU)1/2 cup spinach, cooked: 472 mcg RAE (9,433 IU)1/2 medium cantaloupe: 466 mcg RAE (9,334 IU)1/2 cup kale, cooked: 443 mcg RAE (8,854 IU)1/2 cup collard greens, cooked: 361 mcg RAE (7,220 IU)1 ounce fortified oat cereal: 215 mcg RAE (721 IU)one mango: 181 mcg RAE (3,636 IU)8 ounces nonfat milk (vitamin A added): 149 mcg RAE (500 IU)8 ounces 2% fat milk (vitamin A added): 134 mcg RAE (464 IU)8 ounces whole milk: 110 mcg RAE (395 IU)1 tablespoon butter: 95 mcg RAE (355 IU)one large egg: 80 mcg RAE (270 IU)1/2 cup cooked broccoli: 60 mcg RAE (1,207 IU)Both processing (like chopping, grating, or juicing) and cooking food make provitamin A carotenoids easier for your body to absorb. You'll also absorb more if you eat a small amount of fat (about a teaspoon) at the same time.Should you take a vitamin A supplement?Probably not. Most people get plenty of vitamin A from their diet, and prenatal vitamins also usually contain vitamin A. Read the label on yours to make sure that you're not getting more than the recommended amount, and that it's not all the preformed version.If you think you need a vitamin A supplement, or if you have questions about the vitamin A in your prenatal supplement, ask your healthcare provider for guidance.Signs of a vitamin A deficiencyBecause it's easy to get enough vitamin A from your diet, Vitamin A deficiencies in the United States are rare, except as a result of some medical conditions. Signs of a deficiency include impaired night vision and a weakened immune system. People who are deficient may also develop a condition calledxerophthalmia, which results in a cornea that becomes dry and thick.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014. Vitamin A.

Alternative and complementary therapies for autism,https://www.babycenter.com/0_alternative-and-complementary-therapies-for-autism_10396947.bc,"Alternative therapies  also called complementary therapies  are medicines or treatments that are usually used along with standard medical care. Most people use the terms interchangeably, and many parents who have a child with autism spectrum disorder try some kind of alternative approach when conventional treatment doesn't seem to work. Here's what you need to know.Should I try alternative therapies for my child with autism?Theres no easy answer. Many families grappling with autism are eager to try anything that could possibly help their child. But alternative therapies are especially tricky because no one knows exactly why they work  or why they don't.""I tell my families I understand their interest in looking into alternative medicine,"" says Kristin Sohl, medical director of the University of Missouri's Thompson Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders. ""I say that's fine. However, there are no [alternative] treatments that are absolutely proven to work.""But some alternative therapies do eventually become accepted mainstream treatments. For example, applied behavior analysis (ABA) started out as an alternative therapy for autism and now, after much research, it's a standard approach.ABA uses techniques like positive reinforcement to modify a child's behavior. It used to be considered controversial, but the method is now supported by insurance legislation in nearly 40 states. (Though loopholes in legislation and the claim by some insurance companies that applied behavior analysis is still experimental have led some parents to sue for coverage.)""The status quo thought that ABA was bizarre [in the 1970s and 1980s]. Now it's mainstream,"" says Susan Hyman, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Rochester Medical Center and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics autism subcommittee.Therapies such as ABA have been carefully tested in multiple studies involving large numbers of patients, and the results reviewed by experts before being published in respected journals.On the other hand, most alternative therapies have been investigated in only a few small studies, and that's not enough evidence to prove that a treatment works. Also, flaws in study design, misinterpretation of results, researcher bias, or too few participants are common problems.Safety is another concern. With some treatments, experts don't know what's safe. For example, dietary supplements  such as vitamins, melatonin, and omega-3s  aren't regulated as strictly as prescription and over-the-counter medication. Even when supplements might be helpful, experts may not know the right dose  particularly for children  or whether the supplements could interact with other medications.And theres increasing concern that supplements may not contain the ingredients they purport to and might even be made of unlisted ingredients, including some that could harm a child.A third issue is cost. Shelling out money for a treatment that may not work can be an expensive gamble. Health insurance usually doesn't cover unproven therapies, so you'll probably have to pay out of pocket.How can I tell if an alternative therapy is worth trying?Before you try an alternative therapy, ask your child's doctor if she knows whether a therapy is safe and worth trying. Doctors often aren't opposed to trying alternative therapies as long as they don't seem harmful or interfere with routine treatment. And if you opt to try a particular therapy, keep your child's doctor in the loop so she can coordinate care.Don't try more than one new therapy at a time. If you do, you'll have no way to evaluate what, if anything, is working or causing side effects. Work with your child's doctor to determine how long to try each therapy.""A lot of families go to a holistic provider and get put on a hodgepodge of stuff,"" says Sohl. ""Then they're in a mess, paying thousands of dollars a month, with no way to know if anything is working.""Take careful notes so you can tell if a treatment is working. Write down any changes in your child's symptoms or other possible effects of the treatment.Research alternative treatments with a careful and critical eye. Be wary of claims that seem too good to be true. A good source for learning about alternative therapies and evaluating health claims is theNational Center for Complementary and Integrative Health. Which alternative therapies for autism are probably safe and may be worth trying?Sensory therapyMany children with autism are bothered by loud sounds, bright lights, and touch. Occupational therapy with sensory integration involves exposing children to soothing touch, movement, sound, or smells to lessen autism symptoms.In some small studies, children have shown improvements in self-care and certain social behaviors, along with reduced responsiveness to stimuli.There's no harm in trying sensory therapy. A trial period can help you decide whether it's working for your child.Music therapyFor some children, therapy that incorporates music can be fun and engaging. Supporters say it addresses multiple areas  communication, motor skills, cognitive skills, emotional expression  and can be combined with conventional therapies like ABA.There's little quality research on whether music therapy is effective. Modest evidence suggests it might help with communication and social behavior.Incorporating music into conventional therapy may ease stress and anxiety. It can also be enjoyable for both parents and children.Children who are particularly sensitive to noise might not enjoy this approach. If you try it, the therapist should be able to work with any auditory sensitivity your child might have.There are no apparent risks or adverse side effects with music therapy.YogaPracticing yoga requires discipline, which can be an important skill for children who have autism. Yoga combines meditation and movement, and practitioners value it for helping with relaxation, mindfulness, and overall fitness.A few small studies concluded yoga can help reduce negative behaviors, including social withdrawal and aggression, and improve communication skills.Practicing yoga poses very little risk. As with any exercise program, check with your child's doctor before beginning.Look for a yoga instructor who understands your child's needs and abilities and can adapt sessions accordingly.MassageMassage involves rubbing and light pressure. It may ease pain, reduce anxiety and depression, and lower stress. It can be a very enjoyable experience for children who are comfortable being touched.There's little research on this subject, and existing studies are very small.Massage is unlikely to cause any harm. Be sure to choose a licensed massage therapist, ideally one who belongs to the American Massage Therapy Association.Parents can learn massage techniques to use at home with their child.Therapeutic horseback ridingProponents of animal therapy such as horseback riding (sometimes called equine therapy or hippotherapy) say it helps with mood, emotional control, social interaction, motor skills, and sensory integration.Kids with autism often have trouble interpreting other people's emotions and expressions. Therapeutic riding requires control, focus, communication, and anticipating the horse's movements, Hyman says. Practice anticipating how a horse will react may help children anticipate people's reactions.A few small studies on horseback riding and autism suggest this therapy may be beneficial.Riding sessions can be expensive. Prices vary widely but $30 to $60 for a 20- to 45-minute session is a ballpark range. Therapeutic riding isn't usually covered by insurance but might be if a professional therapist oversees the sessions.Make sure your child wears a helmet. The instructor or therapist should always accompany your child and check that the helmet, saddle, stirrups, and other equipment are safe and secure.Even if you don't see obvious improvement from therapeutic riding, it still may be a fun activity for your family. ""It's okay to have fun and experience joy with your child,"" says Hyman.Which alternative therapies for autism may be risky or are less likely to work?Gluten- and casein-free dietsFor unknown reasons, many children with autism suffer from digestive issues. Parents of kids with these problems sometimes experiment with eliminating gluten (a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye) and casein (a protein found in dairy) from their child's diet. Some see improvement in behavior and autism symptoms  better eye contact, for example, and greater attention span  when their child's meals don't contain gluten, casein, or both.The few studies that have explored any connection between autism symptoms and casein or gluten are inconclusive.A restricted diet risks depriving your child of important nutrients including calcium, protein, fiber, and vitamins A, D, and B. Some children on gluten- and casein-free diets have been found to have lower bone density. It's important to work with your child's doctor and, if possible, a nutritionist to review your child's diet and make sure he's getting the nutrients he needs for healthy development.Casein- and gluten-free diets are difficult to maintain and can be expensive.Don't make sudden, drastic dietary changes. If your child tries this diet, focus on eliminating either gluten or casein at first  not both. Read food labels carefully to avoid these proteins.Your child's doctor may want to test for celiac disease, a genetic disease in which gluten damages the small intestine. She can help you figure out how to investigate whether gluten or casein may be problematic for your child.Note that these restricted diets usually emphasize healthier, unprocessed foods, and that shift could be the reason for any improvement in symptoms. For example, seeing improvement after eliminating dairy products could point to lactose intolerance rather than a problem with casein.Learn more about celiac disease, wheat allergy, and gluten sensitivity.B6, B12, and other vitaminsSome small studies suggest children with autism have nutritional deficiencies that may influence their symptoms. One theory is that a shortage of certain nutrients could damage cells, which in turn may play a part in neurological issues. Some vitamins used in therapy include B6 (taken with magnesium), B12 (methyl), and C.A few small studies on vitamin therapies have yielded interesting results that researchers are still exploring.Vitamin supplements can be toxic in high doses. Large amounts of B6, for example, can cause nerve damage, digestive issues, irritability, incontinence, and other problems.Avoid supplements that are administered in concentrated form by injection, an invasive procedure than can hurt and be stressful for children.Learn more about children's vitamins.MelatoninChildren with autism often have trouble settling down and going to sleep. It's not clear why, but preliminary research has suggested that the brain systems that regulate sleep may be disrupted in children with autism.Melatonin is a naturally occurring hormone that helps regulate the sleep cycle. The synthetic version is a popular therapy for kids with autism.Several small studies suggest melatonin supplements may help children with autism fall asleep more easily and sleep more soundly.Many consider melatonin safe in small doses for short-term use, but its hard to know whats in a product since the supplement industry is largely unregulated. Also, it's unknown whether long-term use is safe, and there are no formal dosing recommendations. Ask your child's doctor for guidance.Melatonin might not be safe for children with certain conditions, including diabetes or seizure disorders, because it can affect their hormone levels.Before you try melatonin, talk with your child's doctor about whether your child might have another condition affecting his sleep.Omega-3sOmega-3 fatty acids are important for brain development and function. The best source of omega-3s is seafood, and it's unclear whether supplements provide the same benefits. Omega-3 supplements are sometimes recommended for children with autism to ease hyperactivity and repetitive behavior.A few very small studies suggest omega-3 supplements may reduce hyperactivity.Side effects are uncommon but may involve gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea or indigestion.There is no recommended dose for children, and it's hard to know exactly what you're getting in any particular product. Your child's doctor might be able to recommend a brand and dose.Talk with your child's doctor before starting omega-3 supplements, which can worsen bleeding disorders.You might want to explore boosting your child's omega-3 intake through his diet instead of turning to supplements (but follow dietary guidelines to minimize his exposure to mercury). Types of fish low in mercury and high in healthy fats include anchovy, herring, mackerel (Atlantic, jack, chub), rainbow trout (farm raised), salmon (wild or farm raised), sardines, shad (American), and whitefish. Which alternative therapies for autism are dangerous or dont work?Hyperbaric oxygenHyperbaric oxygen therapy (HBOT) involves inhaling concentrated oxygen in a pressure chamber, which leads to more oxygen-rich blood flowing through the body. HBOT is often used to treat carbon monoxide poisoning, wounds that won't heal, and decompression sickness related to scuba diving.Research has explored whether hyperbaric oxygen therapy could improve autism symptoms by increasing oxygen to the brain to reduce inflammation, but so far the therapy appears ineffective.HBOT hasn't been studied enough to determine whether it's safe for children.This therapy can cause ear injuries, seizures, and nearsightedness.Treatments can cost $150 to $900 each, and home chambers  which have been blamed for deaths due to fire and explosions  can cost as much as $17,000.ChelationThis treatment claims to flush heavy metals from a child's body by using drugs that bind to iron, lead, mercury, cadmium, zinc, and some other metals. The metals are then eliminated from a child's body when he urinates. Chelation is an accepted treatment for lead poisoning or an overload of iron stemming from a blood disorder.There's no evidence chelation has any effect on autism symptoms  nor is there any evidence that mercury or other metals targeted by chelation play a role in autism.Chelation can sap a child's body of calcium, iron, and magnesium.This therapy can cause kidney damage, irregular heartbeat, and death. Injections are especially risky  one child with autism died after being injected with sodium ethylene diamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA), a drug used for chelation.Antiviral and antifungal treatmentSome people suspect that autism is caused by a virus or fungal infection and try antiviral or antifungal medication to combat the disorder.There is no evidence that viral or fungal infections cause autism.These medications can have serious side effects including allergic reactions, anemia, and liver damage.Sohl has a patient whose parents have used antiviral injections for 15 years. ""I have desperately tried to get them to stop because I'm worried about the long-term side effects, but they say they don't know what he'd be like if they stopped."" When asked to prescribe the injections, Sohl says no.SecretinSecretin is a hormone produced by the small intestine that regulates the secretions of the stomach and pancreas. For a time, it was thought to help improve functioning in kids with autism, especially with language skills. According to Hyman, hundreds and maybe thousands of kids in the United States were infused with secretin.""There is a good, solid body of research that demonstrated it does not improve language,"" says Hyman.Read our overview for parents to learn more about autism.Learn the early signs of autism and who to see if you suspect your child has autism.Show sources Hide sources Kristin Sohl, a pediatrician who specializes in autism and medical director of the University of Missouri's Thompson Center for Autism & Neurodevelopmental Disorders, one of 15 multidisciplinary centers in the U.S. that are part of Autism Speaks' Autism Treatment Network.Dr. Susan Hyman, a professor of pediatrics at the University of Rochester and chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' autism subcommittee.Raphael Bernier, clinical director at Seattle Children's Autism Clinic and an associate professor in the department of psychiatry at the University of Washington.American Psychiatric Association.

Eating fish when you're breastfeeding: How to avoid mercury and still get your omega-3s,https://www.babycenter.com/0_eating-fish-when-youre-breastfeeding-how-to-avoid-mercury-an_10319858.bc,"Should I eat fish if I'm breastfeeding?Many nursing moms struggle with this question. The answer is yes  even if you don't normally eat seafood, consider adding it to your pregnancy diet. But you'll need to choose your fish carefully.Studies show that fish provide an array of nutrients that are important for your baby's development. Most experts agree that the key nutrients are two omega-3 fatty acids  DHA and EPA  that are difficult to find in other foods. Fish is also low in saturated fat and high in protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients that are crucial for a baby's health.On the other hand, you've probably heard that fish contain contaminants such as mercury, which can harm a baby's developing brain and nervous system.Because omega-3s are passed to a baby in breast milk, most experts agree that it's a good idea for nursing women to eat some fish. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that women who are pregnant or nursing eat 8 to 12 ounces a week of a variety of seafood that is low in mercury. But it's hard to figure out which fish are best.Below, we offer some guidelines to help you limit your baby's exposure to mercury while getting the nutrients you and your baby need.How does mercury get into fish?Mercury is everywhere, even in the air we breathe.Some of the sources (such as volcanoes and forest fires) are natural. It's also released into the air by power plants, cement plants, and certain chemical and industrial manufacturers.And mercury has been used for decades in making thermometers, thermostats, fluorescent lights, and many other products. When these items end up in a landfill, the mercury may be released.When mercury settles into water, bacteria convert it into a form called methylmercury. Fish absorb methylmercury from the water they swim in and the organisms they eat. Methylmercury binds tightly to the proteins in fish muscle and remains there even after the fish is cooked.What are the risks of getting too much mercury while I'm breastfeeding?Your body easily absorbs methylmercury from fish. While the metal doesn't typically enter breast milk in large amounts, the mercury that does make its way into your milk is absorbed by your nursing baby's body at a time when she's especially susceptible to its effects.Many studies have shown that exposure to even low doses of methylmercury can impair a baby's growing brain and nervous system. The results can range from mild to severe. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cognitive skills (like memory and attention), language, motor skills, and vision may be affected.Babies (including those in utero) and young children are generally thought to be most vulnerable to damage from methylmercury. That's why women who are pregnant, thinking of becoming pregnant, or nursing need to pay particular attention to the kind of fish they're eating.Why not just stop eating fish?Fish is too good a nutritional choice. Studies have shown that getting enough omega-3s in utero and during infancy (either through breastfeeding or supplemented formula) has a positive effect on a child's vision and cognitive development.Which fish are best to eat?Good choices include salmon, trout, anchovies, herring, sardines, and shad. For example, 8 ounces of salmon, 12 ounces of rainbow trout, or 16 sardines a week should give you a good dose of omega-3s with minimal mercury.Purdue University publishes a handy wallet card that tells you where most commercial fish falls on the mercury contamination scale and how much of each it's okay to eat.Purdue also has free iPhone/iPod apps that can help you track your seafood consumption and estimate your intake of omega-3s, mercury, and PCBs, a group of industrial pollutants that can harm your baby's nervous system.Which fish should I avoid altogether?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EPA advise women of childbearing age and young children not to eat four high-mercury species: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico.Other experts and advocacy groups would like to expand this list. Purdue University toxicologist Charles Santerre recommends that you also avoid eating all fresh or frozen tuna, striped bass, bluefish, Chilean sea bass, golden snapper, marlin, orange roughy, amberjack, Crevalle jack, Spanish mackerel from the Gulf of Mexico, and walleye from the Great Lakes.He also recommends not eating striped bass and bluefish, which can be high in mercury and PCBs. Pan-fried salmon with baby leaf saladSeared salmon served over a bed of ripe tomatoes and baby leaf salad.What about canned tuna?There's some disagreement when it comes to canned tuna.The FDA says it's okay to eat canned light tuna but suggests limiting your intake of albacore (white) tuna, which is higher in methylmercury, to 6 ounces per week.Purdue University guidelines say it's okay to eat up to 12 ounces a week of canned light tuna but recommend limiting your consumption of canned white tuna to 4 ounces per week.Other experts, like Edward Groth, an independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, recommend avoiding canned tuna entirely. Groth points out that canned tuna is by far the largest source of methylmercury in the American diet.Consumer Reports magazine also recommends avoiding all forms of canned tuna. They've found that white tuna has consistently high levels of methylmercury and some light tuna has high levels as well, so it's not worth the risk.What about fish caught in local waters?Check advisories from your state or local health and environmental agencies to figure out which fish to avoid and how much of each type it's safe to eat.These advisories are usually indicated on signposts in fishing areas. You can also access your state's advisories on this map, which is kept up-to-date by Purdue University.If you don't find an advisory for local fish, the EPA recommends limiting your intake of it to 6 ounces per week and not eating any other fish that week.What can I eat, other than fish, to get my omega-3s?It's not easy to find DHA and EPA in other foods.Many foods  such as eggs, milk, soy beverages, juice, yogurt, bread, and cereal  are now fortified with omega-3s, but most of these contain only ALA. ALA is an omega-3 that provides some health benefits, but not the same ones you get from DHA and EPA. (Most food labels don't specify the type of omega-3.)You may have heard that flaxseed is a good source of omega 3s, but it does not provide DHA or EPA. The only omega-3 fatty acid in plant foods is ALA.What about omega-3 supplements?If you don't eat fish, you might choose to take an omega-3 supplement. A few studies have shown small benefits in child cognitive development when pregnant or nursing women take omega-3 supplements, but most have shown no significant benefits from these supplements.Omega-3 supplements provide EPA and DHA and are mercury-free. Many contain fish oil, but mercury is not stored in fatty tissue, so it's not in the oil, although PCBs may be.Note: Some women turn to cod liver oil as a source of omega-3s. This is risky. Cod liver oil is very high in vitamin A, which can be toxic at high doses. Another concern is that it's impossible to verify whether the oil has been filtered to eliminate toxins such as PCBs.How much omega-3s should I get each day?The 2015 U.S. Dietary Guidelines suggest that pregnant and breastfeeding women get 250 milligrams of EPA and/or DHA a day by eating 8 ounces of fish that are rich in omega-3s each week.The Food and Nutrition Board (the group that sets the recommended daily intake levels for nutrients) has not set recommended levels for DHA or EPA.How can I find out how much mercury is in my body?It's simple to test for mercury in your blood or in a hair sample, but testing is not routinely recommended. Following the guidelines above for amounts and types of fish to eat should help keep your mercury levels in a safe range.If you eat fish more often than recommended and are concerned, talk with your healthcare provider about having a test done. If your levels indicate that you're getting too much mercury, your provider or a dietitian can help you change your diet accordingly.Learn more:Should your kids eat fish: How they can avoid mercury and still get their omega-3s.This article was reviewed by:Edward Groth, Ph.D., independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazineKeli Hawthorne, M.S., R.D., L.D., director for clinical research for the Department of Pediatrics at the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at AustinCharles R.

Eating fish when you're trying to conceive: How to avoid mercury and still get your omega-3s,https://www.babycenter.com/0_eating-fish-when-youre-trying-to-conceive-how-to-avoid-mercu_10319859.bc,"Should I eat fish while trying to conceive?Many women who are planning a pregnancy wonder about this. The answer is yes  even if you don't normally eat seafood, consider adding it to your pregnancy diet. But you'll need to choose your fish carefully.Studies show that fish provide an array of nutrients that are important for your baby's early development. Most experts agree that the key nutrients are two omega-3 fatty acids  DHA and EPA  that are difficult to find in other foods. Fish is also low in saturated fat and high in protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients that are crucial for a developing baby and a healthy pregnancy.Your body will store omega-3s for several weeks, so it's a good idea to make sure you're getting enough now so you'll have adequate levels when you become pregnant.On the other hand, you've probably heard that fish contain contaminants such as mercury, which can harm a baby's developing brain and nervous system. Mercury accumulates in the body  and takes time to go away once you reduce your intake  so you're right to be concerned about your exposure before becoming pregnant.Most experts agree that women in their childbearing years should eat some fish. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that adults consume about 8 ounces a week of a variety of seafood that is low in mercury. (For pregnant or nursing women, they recommend 8 to 12 ounces a week.) But it can be hard to figure out which ones are best.Here are some guidelines to help you limit your exposure to mercury while getting the nutrients you and your baby will need.How does mercury get into fish?Mercury is everywhere, even in the air we breathe.Some of the sources (such as volcanoes and forest fires) are natural.

Fish absorb methylmercury from the water they swim in and the organisms they eat. Methylmercury binds tightly to the proteins in fish muscle and remains there even after the fish is cooked.What are the risks of getting too much mercury?Your body easily absorbs methylmercury from fish and stores it for months. Once you become pregnant, the mercury in your body will cross the placenta, too.Many studies have shown that exposure even to low doses of methylmercury during pregnancy can impair a baby's growing brain and nervous system. The results can range from mild to severe. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cognitive skills (like memory and attention), language, motor skills, and vision may be affected.Babies in utero, infants, and young children are generally thought to be most vulnerable to damage from methylmercury. That's why women who are pregnant, thinking of becoming pregnant, or nursing need to pay particular attention to the kind of fish they're eating.Why not just stop eating fish?Fish is too good a nutritional choice.For example, in one large Danish study, children whose mothers ate the most fish during pregnancy (an average of 14 ounces a week) had better motor and cognitive skills at 6 months and at 18 months than those whose mothers ate little fish. And those whose mothers ate the least fish had the lowest developmental scores.Some studies also show that eating fish during pregnancy may help prevent preterm birth and low birth weight. So you'll want to keep eating fish once you become pregnant, too.Which fish are best to eat?Good choices include salmon, trout, anchovies, herring, sardines, and shad. For example, 8 ounces of salmon, 12 ounces of rainbow trout, or 16 sardines a week should give you a good dose of omega-3s with minimal mercury.Purdue University publishes a handy wallet card that tells you where most commercial fish falls on the mercury contamination scale and how much of each it's okay to eat.Purdue also has free iPhone/iPod apps that can help you track your seafood consumption and estimate your intake of omega-3s, mercury, and PCBs, a group of industrial pollutants that can harm your baby's nervous system.Which fish should I avoid altogether?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EPA advise women of childbearing age and young children not to eat four high-mercury species: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico.Other experts and advocacy groups would like to expand this list.

Eating fish during pregnancy: How to avoid mercury and still get your omega-3s,https://www.babycenter.com/0_eating-fish-during-pregnancy-how-to-avoid-mercury-and-still_10319861.bc,"Should I eat fish while I'm pregnant?Many pregnant women struggle with this question. The answer is yes  even if you don't normally eat seafood, consider adding it to your pregnancy diet. But you'll need to choose your fish carefully.Studies show that fish provide an array of nutrients that are important for your baby's early development. Most experts agree that the key nutrients are two omega-3 fatty acids  DHA and EPA  that are difficult to find in other foods. Fish is also low in saturated fat and high in protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients that are crucial for a developing baby and a healthy pregnancy.On the other hand, you've probably heard that fish contain contaminants such as mercury, which can harm a baby's developing brain and nervous system.Most experts agree that pregnant women should eat some fish. The 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend eating 8 to 12 ounces a week of a variety of seafood that's low in methylmercury while you're pregnant or nursing a baby. But it can be hard to figure out which ones are best.Here are some guidelines to help you limit your exposure to mercury while getting the nutrients you and your baby need.How does mercury get into fish?Mercury is everywhere, even in the air we breathe.Some of the sources (such as volcanoes and forest fires) are natural. It's also released into the air by power plants, cement plants, and certain chemical and industrial manufacturers.And mercury has been used for decades in making thermometers, thermostats, fluorescent lights, and many other products. When these items end up in a landfill, the mercury may be released.When mercury settles into water, bacteria convert it into a form called methylmercury. Fish absorb methylmercury from the water they swim in and the organisms they eat. Methylmercury binds tightly to the proteins in fish muscle and remains there even after the fish is cooked.What are the risks of getting too much mercury while I'm pregnant?Your body easily absorbs methylmercury from fish  and when you're pregnant, methylmercury crosses the placenta.Many studies have shown that exposure even to lose doses of methylmercury during pregnancy can impair a baby's growing brain and nervous system. The results can range from mild to severe. According to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), cognitive skills (like memory and attention), language, motor skills, and vision may be affected.Babies in utero, infants, and young children are generally thought to be most vulnerable to damage from methylmercury. That's why women who are pregnant, thinking of becoming pregnant, or nursing need to pay particular attention to the kind of fish they're eating.Why not just stop eating fish?Fish is too good a nutritional choice  especially during pregnancy.For example, in one large Danish study, children whose mothers ate the most fish during pregnancy (an average of 14 ounces a week) had better motor and cognitive skills at 6 months and at 18 months than those whose mothers ate little fish. And those whose mothers ate the least fish had the lowest developmental scores.Some studies also show that eating fish during pregnancy may help prevent preterm birth and low birth weight.Which fish are best to eat?Good choices include salmon, trout, anchovies, herring, sardines, and shad.Purdue University publishes a handy wallet card that tells you where most commercial fish falls on the mercury contamination scale and how much of each it's okay to eat.Purdue also has free iPhone/iPod apps that can help you track your seafood consumption and estimate your intake of omega-3s, mercury, and PCBs, a group of industrial pollutants that can harm your baby's nervous system.Which fish should I avoid altogether?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EPA advise women of childbearing age and young children not to eat four high-mercury species: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico.Other experts and advocacy groups would like to expand this list. Purdue University toxicologist Charles Santerre recommends that you also avoid eating all fresh or frozen tuna, striped bass, bluefish, Chilean sea bass, golden snapper, marlin, orange roughy, amberjack, Crevalle jack, Spanish mackerel from the Gulf of Mexico, and walleye from the Great Lakes.He also recommends not eating striped bass and bluefish, which can be high in mercury and PCBs. What about canned tuna?There's some disagreement when it comes to canned tuna.The FDA says it's okay to eat canned light tuna but suggests limiting your intake of albacore (white) tuna, which is higher in methylmercury, to 6 ounces per week.Purdue University guidelines say it's okay to eat up to 12 ounces a week of canned light tuna but recommend limiting your consumption of canned white tuna to 4 ounces per week.Other experts, like Edward Groth, an independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, recommend avoiding canned tuna entirely. Groth points out that canned tuna is by far the largest source of methylmercury in the American diet.Consumer Reports magazine also recommends that pregnant women avoid all forms of canned tuna. They've found that white tuna has consistently high levels of methylmercury and some light tuna has high levels as well, so it's not worth the risk.What about fish caught in local waters?Check advisories from your state or local health and environmental agencies to figure out which fish to avoid and how much of each type it's safe to eat.These advisories are usually indicated on signposts in fishing areas. You can also access your state's advisories on this map, which is kept up-to-date by Purdue University.If you don't find an advisory for local fish, the EPA recommends limiting your intake of it to 6 ounces per week and not eating any other fish that week.What can I eat, other than fish, to get my omega-3s?Fish is a wonderful source of the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA  crucial for baby brain and eye development. It's not easy to find these in other foods.Many foods  such as eggs, milk, soy beverages, juice, yogurt, bread, and cereal  are now fortified with omega-3s, but most of these contain only ALA. ALA is an omega-3 that provides some health benefits, but not the same ones you get from DHA and EPA. (Most food labels don't specify the type of omega-3.)You may have heard that flaxseed is a good source of omega 3s, but it does not provide DHA or EPA. The only omega-3 fatty acid in plant foods is ALA.What about omega-3 supplements?If you don't eat fish, you might choose to take an omega-3 supplement. A few studies have shown small benefits in child cognitive development when pregnant or nursing women take omega-3 supplements, but most have shown no significant benefits from these supplements.Omega-3 supplements provide EPA and DHA and are mercury-free. Many contain fish oil, but mercury is not stored in fatty tissue, so it's not in the oil, although PCBs may be.Note: Some women turn to cod liver oil as a source of omega-3s. This is risky. Cod liver oil is very high in vitamin A, which can be toxic at high doses. Another concern is that it's impossible to verify whether the oil has been filtered to eliminate toxins such as PCBs.How much omega-3s should I get each day?The 2015 U.S. Dietary Guidelines suggest that pregnant and breastfeeding women get 250 milligrams of EPA and/or DHA a day by eating 8 ounces of fish that are rich in omega-3s each week.The Food and Nutrition Board (the group that sets the recommended daily intake levels for nutrients) has not set recommended levels for DHA or EPA.How can I find out how much mercury is in my body?It's simple to test for mercury in your blood or in a hair sample, but testing is not routinely recommended. Following the guidelines above for amounts and types of fish to eat should help keep your mercury levels in a safe range.If you eat fish more often than recommended and are concerned, talk with your healthcare provider about having a test done. If your levels indicate that you're getting too much mercury, your provider or a dietitian can help you change your diet accordingly.Learn moreIs it safe to take omega-3 supplements when you're pregnant?Eating fish when you're breastfeedingThis article was reviewed by:Edward Groth, Ph.D., independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazineKeli Hawthorne, M.S., R.D., L.D., director for clinical research for the Department of Pediatrics at the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at AustinCharles R.

Formula feeding: Helping your baby get used to the bottle,https://www.babycenter.com/0_formula-feeding-helping-your-baby-get-used-to-the-bottle_6421.bc,"Whether your child is a newborn just starting to formula-feed, a breastfed baby getting supplemental formula, or a baby transitioning from breast milk to formula, she'll need a little time to adjust. The first few feedings may be a little awkward, but don't worry  she'll soon get the hang of it. Read on for some ways you can make bottle feeding go smoothly.What's the best way to bottle-feed my baby?As with breastfeeding, most experts agree that you shouldn't follow a rigid schedule in the early weeks when formula feeding, though you may be able to work out an approximate pattern for feeding within a month or two. Offer the bottle every two to three hours at first, or as your baby seems hungry.Also, keep in mind that the way a baby sucks from a bottle is very different from the way she sucks from a breast because getting milk from a bottle is easier. (Some babies prefer the bottle for this reason.)Don't force more than she seems ready to eat. Until your baby weighs about 10 pounds, she'll probably take 1.5 to 3 ounces per feeding. Your baby's doctor can advise you about suitable amounts for your baby as she grows.Bottle feeding can be just as nurturing as breastfeeding, so cuddle your baby close. Some babies like to be held in a nursing position while drinking from a bottle, but others find it disconcerting. Whatever position you choose, try to maintain eye contact with your baby. (And don't feed her while she's lying on her back because she may choke.)Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.What can I do if my baby resists taking a bottle?Whatever technique you decide to use, be consistent and try it a few times, especially in the beginning. Here are a few tips:Offer your baby a bottle before he gets too hungry. You want him to be interested in food, but not so hungry that a cold nipple frustrates him. (Cold rubber or latex isn't that appealing.)Let your baby play with the nipple. If he just chews on it, let him for now. He's becoming familiar with it and may actually start sucking on it soon.Hold him in a different position. Put him in an infant car seat so he is semi-upright, and then feed him the bottle while facing him. Or try feeding him on your lap with his back to your chest. Once he's used to taking a bottle, you can hold him as you usually would for feedings.Try different temperatures. It could be that your baby prefers his milk slightly warmer or colder than you've been giving him. Experiment with different temperatures to see what he prefers.(Never use a microwave to heat a bottle of formula. A microwave heats unevenly and can create hot pockets, leading to burns. It can also cause the nutrients in formula to break down.)Let someone else introduce the bottle. If you're supplementing breastfeeding, it may help to let your partner or another caregiver give your baby the first bottle. Your baby knows your scent and associates it with breastfeeding.Offer the bottle at other times. For example, if your baby has been refusing the bottle during the day, offer it in the evening.Whichever technique you use, remember that your baby needs time to get used to new sensations, so stick with the same nipple, bottle, and feeding technique for a while before trying something different.I feel guilty for not breastfeeding. What should I do?Whatever your reason for not breastfeeding, give yourself a break. Formula feeding is a valid, healthy choice for babies. Formula even has some nutrients that breastfed babies have to get from supplements, like vitamin D.Find out more about formula feeding."
My breastfeeding story: Forced to quit after a medical crisis,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-forced-to-quit-after-a-medical-crisis_10414439.bc,"Name: AmberLives in: Marion, IndianaBreastfeeding experience: Unexpectedly difficultMain challenges: Preemie delivery, low supply, and postpartum complicationsBreastfed for: 3 monthsMy storyI had twins at age 27 and was dead set on breastfeeding. I had to be induced at 35 weeks because I was preeclamptic, and they were born at 3 pounds, 3 ounces  tiny but perfectly healthy.I, on the other hand, wasn't doing so well. My placenta had grown through my uterus, and I needed three surgeries and 20 units of blood. The doctors told me I wouldn't be breastfeeding because my body was in a state of shock and couldn't produce milk. I prayed and prayed, and I did produce some.I had to pump since my babies were too young to nurse. At first I was only getting an ounce at the most, and it took several weeks to make more. My twins were fed my breast milk through a tube, and the nurses added fortifiers to give them more calories and nutrients. When that still wasn't enough, we had to supplement with formula.They ate every three hours, so I pumped every three hours. It was so much work. I wasn't producing as much milk as I wanted to, partly because they were too frail to nurse (the doctors didn't want them to expend energy nursing and lose weight) and without them nursing, my body wasn't properly stimulated to make more milk. I was heartbroken about having to supplement with formula, but I wanted them to survive and I wanted them to come home, so we did what we had to.Finally, 6 weeks later, I was able to nurse my babies. It was like winning a race! But even after nursing, I could tell they were still hungry. I felt very defeated. So the doctors said for me to supplement with formula after each feeding and to keep trying. They were so encouraging!But then they discovered that I still had remnants of my placenta in my uterus. That was hindering milk production since my body was getting signals that I was still pregnant. So they wanted to do another surgery, but they couldn't operate. I had lost 20 units of blood during my delivery, and my body was in such a fragile state  I wasn't medically stable yet. I was put on medication that would filter into my breast milk, and we didn't want the babies to get it, so I had to stop breastfeeding. We switched to formula.I was devastated. It sent me into a horrible postpartum depression. I felt like my body failed me and failed my babies. I wasn't ready to let go.I was put on antidepressants, and I joined a support group for moms. Many of the moms in the group had twins, and hearing other women talk about how it didn't go their way either made me feel more normal. It helped me let go of feeling like a failure, and the formula nourished them. They couldn't take regular formula; they had to get a specially formulated one, so I knew they were getting just what they needed.Because of the scar tissue that formed in my uterus, I was told I'd probably never get pregnant again. But when the twins were 2, I had another child! I breastfed my daughter for 20 months, and I thank God for that experience because it gave me closure on what happened with the twins. I realized that my body didn't fail me  it's just what happened.My biggest lesson learnedIf I could tell myself any advice from the beginning, it's to not have a picture in my mind of what breastfeeding should look like. And if it doesn't work out, there's always a plan B. Plan B is still beautiful. You can still bond with your baby with a bottle.Back to all breastfeeding essays"
Is preeclampsia preventable?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_is-preeclampsia-preventable_10415691.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineNo one knows for sure whether preeclampsia can be prevented since the cause of the condition is unknown. It's likely that different factors are involved. Although it's hard to give clear advice about how to prevent preeclampsia, you can take steps to lower your risk.Most experts believe that preeclampsia happens when the placenta isn't working as well as it should. The placenta connects the baby to the uterus by the umbilical cord. It supplies a baby with oxygen and nutrients, and removes waste.About 5 percent of pregnant women develop preeclampsia, but some women have a higher risk than others. At your first prenatal appointment, your provider will take a detailed medical history to evaluate your risk.What are the risk factors for preeclampsia?The risk factors for preeclampsia include:Being obese (having a body mass index, or BMI, of 30 or higher) at the start of your pregnancyHaving a family or personal history of preeclampsiaExpecting twins or moreBeing age 35 or olderHaving in vitro fertilization (IVF)Having an autoimmune condition, such as lupusHaving another chronic condition, such as high blood pressure before pregnancy (chronic hypertension), kidney disease, or diabetes (type 1 or 2)Having the blood-clotting disorder thrombophiliaExpecting your first babyIf you have any of these risk factors, talk to your healthcare provider. There may be ways to lower your chance of developing preeclampsia, either before you become pregnant or during pregnancy.What can I do before pregnancy to lower the risk of preeclampsia?Some risk factors  like your age or the number of babies you're carrying  are out of your control. But you can change other risk factors. If you're overweight, for example, losing weight before you get pregnant may reduce your risk of getting preeclampsia.Getting pre-existing medical conditions under good control now also helps reduce your risk of complications during pregnancy so you and your baby stay healthy. If you have a long-term medical condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, schedule a preconception checkup with your provider. Because preeclampsia involves an increase in blood pressure, women who already have high blood pressure are at greater risk of developing the condition. If you have diabetes, it's important that your blood sugar levels are well controlled before you become pregnant.Your options for making lifestyle changes and taking medication are often limited once you're pregnant, so use the time before pregnancy to do everything you can to maximize your health.What can I do during pregnancy to lower the risk of preeclampsia?Once you're pregnant, be sure to attend all your prenatal appointments. At each visit, your provider takes your blood pressure and may check your urine for protein, which can be a sign of preeclampsia. If you have an especially high risk of developing preeclampsia, your provider may recommend that you take a low dose (81 milligrams) of aspirin daily during pregnancy.Research shows that starting low-dose aspirin at the end of your first trimester can reduce your chance of developing preeclampsia if you're at increased risk. (Don't take any drug when you're pregnant without checking with your provider first.)In the event that you develop the condition, you can start treatment immediately.What are the symptoms of preeclampsia?It's also important to know the symptoms of preeclampsia, so you can watch for them between appointments. Call your provider right away if you have:Swelling of your hands or faceSudden weight gainVision problems, such as blurring and seeing spots or flashesSevere pain below your ribsDifficulty breathingA severe headache that won't go awayNausea and vomitingDo supplements help prevent preeclampsia?There's little to no evidence that supplements can prevent preeclampsia, even though you may find lists of recommendations when searching online for ways to avoid the condition.Some research shows calcium could help prevent preeclampsia in women who don't get enough of the mineral. But most Americans already get the recommended amount of 1,000 milligrams daily from their diet, so the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists doesn't recommend extra calcium for healthy women in the United States.Some women have also tried taking Vitamin C, E, or fish oils to prevent preeclampsia, but again, there's no evidence that these supplements have a beneficial effect. Unless your provider specifically advises otherwise, a regular prenatal vitamin containing folic acid is all you need.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information about preeclampsia and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

Magnesium in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_magnesium-in-your-childs-diet_10324694.bc,"Magnesium is crucial for children's good health and development. Read on to find out how much magnesium your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Find out more: Other important nutrients for childrenWhy magnesium is importantThe body uses this important mineral to keep bones strong and the heart rhythm steady. It also supports the immune system and helps maintain muscle and nerve function.How much magnesium does your child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 80 milligrams (mg) dailyAges 4 to 8 years: 130 mg dailyYour child doesn't have to get enough magnesium every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of magnesiumNuts and legumes are some of the best sources of magnesium. Leafy green vegetables are another good source because the substance that gives vegetables their color contains the mineral. Bread made from whole grain wheat flour is another good option. Some magnesium-rich foods to try:1/2 cup all-bran cereal: 93 mg1 ounce dry roasted cashews: 74 mg1/4 cup oil roasted peanuts: 63 mg1 cup soymilk, plain: 61 mg1/2 cup edamame (shelled and cooked): 50 mg1 tablespoon almond butter: 45 mg1/4 cup cooked spinach: 39 mgone packet instant oatmeal: 36 mg1/4 cup black beans: 30 mg1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter: 25 mgone slice whole wheat bread: 23 mg1/2 cup plain skim milk yogurt: 21 mg1/4 cup long grain brown rice: 21 mg1/4 cup kidney beans: 18 mg1/4 cup black-eyed peas: 17 mg1/2 medium banana: 16 mg1/2 cup milk (low-fat): 17 mg1/4 cup raisins: 12 mg1/4 cup cubed avocado: 11 mg1 ounce halibut: 8 mgThe amount of magnesium in a food can vary depending on serving size or brand. Note that nuts and seeds are choking hazards for very young children, and nut butters should be spread thinly for the same reason. Other foods (like beans) should be mashed.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much magnesium?From supplements, yes. Getting too much magnesium from diet alone is highly unlikely, but it is possible to overload on magnesium in dietary supplements.Taking too much magnesium in supplement form can cause problems like diarrhea and stomach cramps. In very large doses, magnesium can be toxic.The tolerable upper intake level for magnesium in supplement form is 65 mg per day for children ages 1 to 3, and 110 mg per day for children ages 4 to 8. That's the maximum amount of magnesium added to a normal daily diet considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine.There is no upper intake level of magnesium you get from food.Show sources Hide sources IOM. 1997.

Vitamin D in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-d-in-your-childs-diet_10324696.bc,"Vitamin D is crucial for children's good health and development. Read on to find out how much vitamin D your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for childrenWhy vitamin D is importantVitamin D helps the body absorb minerals like calcium and builds strong teeth and bones. According to researcher Michael F. Holick, professor of medicine, physiology, and biophysics at Boston University School of Medicine, vitamin D deficiency can not only cause rickets (a disease that can lead to bone deformity and fractures), it can also keep a child from reaching her genetically programmed height and peak bone mass.Vitamin D also functions as a hormone with many other jobs in the body, including regulation of the immune system, insulin production, and cell growth.How much vitamin D does my child need?Infants up to 12 months old need 400 international units (IU), or 10 micrograms (mcg), a day. Children older than 1 need 600 IU, or 15 mcg, a day.Your child doesn't have to get enough vitamin D every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of vitamin DVitamin D is called the ""sunshine vitamin"" because the body can produce it when the skin is exposed to sunlight. But your child's body isn't able to make vitamin D when covered with clothing or sunscreen to block the sun's rays. Other obstacles to vitamin D production from sun exposure include smog, clouds, dark skin, and geographic location.Though it's hard to estimate how much time a person needs to spend in the sun to make the recommended amount of vitamin D, some researchers say spending 5 to 30 minutes outside between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. at least twice a week should do it.But experts warn that UV radiation from the sun is the main cause of skin cancer, and it's hard to judge whether you can get enough vitamin D from the sun without increasing your risk of a potentially deadly skin cancer. So consider finding other ways to get the vitamin D you need.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants, children, and teens take vitamin D supplements of 400 IU each day. Kids who are too young for chewable vitamins can take liquid supplements.Some of the best food sources of vitamin D:1 ounce salmon: 102 IU6 ounces fortified yogurt: 80 IU1 ounce canned tuna, drained and packed in oil: 66 IU1/2 cup orange juice, fortified with 25 percent of daily value for vitamin D: 50 IU1/2 cup fortified milk (whole, low-fat, or skim): 49 IUone slice fortified American cheese: 40 IU1/2 cup fortified, ready-to-eat cereal: 19 IU1 ounce mackerel: 11.6 IU1/2 large egg yolk: 10 IU1/2 teaspoon fortified margarine: 10 IU1/2 ounce Swiss cheese: 6 IUThe amount of vitamin D in a food varies somewhat, depending on the brand of the product.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much vitamin D?It's unlikely but possible. On the contrary, many health experts are concerned that the current recommended amount is too low and that children actually need much more.That said, vitamin D can be harmful if you get too much. According to the Office of Dietary Supplements (a department of the National Institutes of Health), the safe upper limit for infants up to 12 months old is 1,000 to 1,500 IU daily. For kids 1 to 8 years old, the safe upper limit is 2,500 to 3,000 IU each day.Vitamin D is stored in body tissue, so it's best not to get more than what health experts recommend. (Vitamin C, by contrast, isn't stored in the body  any excess is simply eliminated in urine.)To be safe, if you have a very young child, stick to the 400 IUs recommended as an infant supplement. More than 400 IUs may be fine for an older child, but check with your child's doctor to be sure.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Trying to conceive? Five changes to make to your diet now,https://www.babycenter.com/0_trying-to-conceive-five-changes-to-make-to-your-diet-now_3558.bc,"Don't wait until you're pregnant to improve your eating habits. Set the stage now with healthy diet changes to ensure your baby gets off to a strong start.Pay attention to your dietFor both men and women, food and fertility are linked. Stick to a balanced diet to boost your chances of a healthy baby.Eat several servings of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and calcium-rich foods such as yogurt, cheese, and milk every day. Not getting enough nutrients can affect your periods, making it difficult to predict when you ovulate. And you may not ovulate at all if you're significantly underweight or obese.Your partner should also pay attention to his diet since certain vitamins and nutrients  such as zinc and vitamins C and E, and folic acid  are important for making healthy sperm.How can I get pregnant quickly?

See all videosFish is a nutritional powerhouse for a growing baby, offering low-fat protein with omega-3 fatty acids, but you need to take care to avoid types that are high in mercury, which can be dangerous to your unborn baby. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration urges women to eat 8 to 12 ounces of a variety of fish each week.Because mercury can accumulate in your body and linger there for more than a year, avoid high-mercury fish such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish. Instead, eat lower-mercury fish such as salmon and canned light tuna (not albacore, which is higher in mercury) once or twice a week. Read more oneating fish while trying to conceive.Processed meats can be particularly dangerous for pregnant women and should be consumed in small amounts, and smoked or raw meats should be avoided entirely during pregnancy. Even hot dogs or deli meats should be heated until they are steaming before you eat them if you are pregnant.Practice good habits for pregnancyFor many moms-to-be, pregnancy prompts an abrupt change in eating and drinking habits  but some habits are hard to break. Make it easier on yourself by changing habits now, and help ensure your baby gets off to a good start from the moment you conceive.Some solid advice: The occasional bottle of beer or glass of wine probably won't affect your chances of getting pregnant, but alcohol can harm a developing baby. And since you may not know exactly when you ovulate or conceive, you may want to play it safe and cut out alcohol completely. (For non-alcoholic alternatives, see our list of the best virgin drinks).On a related note, if you use any recreational drugs or smoke, quit now. All of these substances and habits can harm a developing fetus.You may also want to cut back on caffeine. The research on whether caffeine can affect fertility is mixed. Experts generally agree that low to moderate caffeine consumption, less than 300 mg a day or about the equivalent of two 8-ounce cups of coffee, won't affect your fertility, but your healthcare provider may recommend that you cut caffeine out entirely to play it safe. Learn more aboutcaffeine and fertility.And once you're pregnant, experts recommend limiting yourself to less than 200 milligrams a day of caffeine  that's a little less than a 12-ounce cup of coffee  because higher amounts have been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage. If you have a strong coffee or soda habit, you might want to start weaning yourself off caffeine now.Take prenatal vitaminsAlthough you can meet almost all of your nutritional needs through a balanced diet, many experts believe that even the healthiest eaters can use extra help. Taking a prenatal vitamin ensures that you're getting enough folic acid and other essential nutrients to boost your chances of conceiving a healthy baby.Remember that a supplement is a safeguard, not a substitute for a sound diet. And since regular over-the-counter multivitamins may contain megadoses of vitamins and minerals that could be harmful to a developing baby, choose a pill formulated specifically for pregnant women. If you have a vegetarian diet, you may also need vitamin D and B-12 supplements, along with extra protein. Talk with your healthcare provider about the right prenatal supplement for you.Get enough folic acidFolic acid has been proven to reduce a baby's risk of neural-tube birth defects such as spina bifida, and it is linked to a lower incidence of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and diabetes.Most women of child-bearing age should take a supplement with 400 micrograms (mcg) daily for at least a month before pregnancy, and 600 micrograms during pregnancy. If you have a family history of neural-tube birth defects or take medication for seizures, your healthcare provider may suggest that you boost your daily intake to 4,000 mcg, or 4 mg, starting at least a month before you conceive and continuing throughout your first trimester.A good over-the-counter prenatal vitamin should contain more than the minimum recommendation of folic acid, between 600 and 800 mcg  what you'll need during pregnancy. In addition, you can eat folate-rich foods, such as dark green leafy vegetables like spinach or kale, citrus fruits, nuts, legumes, whole grains, and fortified breads and cereals.Folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, so your body will flush out the excess if you consume too much. But there's a downside to being water-soluble, too: You can lose a lot of this vitamin in cooking water, so steam or cook vegetables in a small amount of water to preserve the folate.Be aware that getting too much folate may hide a vitamin B-12 deficiency, which is sometimes a problem for vegetarians. Ask your doctor or midwife if you think you may be at risk.Maintain a healthy weightIt might be a good idea to shed some pounds, or gain a few if you're underweight, while you're trying to get pregnant, since you want to be as close as possible to your recommended weight when you conceive. Being over- or underweight can make it harder to get pregnant. Also, obese women have more pregnancy and birth complications, and underweight women are more likely to have a low-birth-weight baby.In addition to following a smart eating plan with low-fat, high-fiber foods, get regular exercise. If you're overweight, aim to lose one to two pounds a week, a safe rate of weight loss. Extreme weight loss from crash dieting can deplete your body's nutritional stores, which isn't a good way to start a pregnancy.Show sources Hide sources Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Undated.

Breastfeeding an adopted baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-an-adopted-baby_8482.bc,"What do I need to know?You may be surprised to learn that you don't have to give birth to nurse a baby  you can breastfeed an adopted baby. But only half of all adopting mothers who attempt to breastfeed will make any milk at all and few will produce enough to fully satisfy their babies.It's the suckling of a child that triggers milk production, not an automatic physiological reaction that begins during pregnancy. Hormones drive the production of breast milk. Prolactin, a hormone created by the pituitary gland, makes breast milk, and if you stimulate the breast enough to increase prolactin levels, you will get milk.An increase in the hormones estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy do help prepare a woman's body for breastfeeding by enlarging the ducts and alveoli  so it's more difficult to start the milk flowing in mothers who haven't delivered a child.Learn more about how your body makes breast milk.What challenges could I face?Inducing lactation isn't complicated, but it does take time: Buy or rent a hospital-grade breast pump, and use it often. But don't expect to lactate overnight. It can take a month or more of regular pumping to trigger milk production (start slow but build up to eight to ten times a day). Timing this with your baby's arrival can be tricky, since few adoptive parents get much advance notice.While adoptive moms can nurse, they usually can't produce as much milk as women who go through pregnancy (that's where the hormones come in).How can I solve these problems?Think of breastfeeding as an opportunity to teach your new baby who her mommy is, and where she can turn for comfort and love. But don't expect to be your baby's sole source of nutrition.""The goal for adoptive mothers who are nursing isn't producing a certain amount of milk  it's bonding with the child,"" says Susan Condon, an international board-certified lactation consultant. ""Most women say they aren't concerned with the volume of milk that they produce. They just want the opportunity to be close to their new baby.""You probably won't be able to coax a full supply of milk from your breasts, so you'll need to supplement. But that doesn't mean you have to use bottles.Condon recommends the Medela Supplemental Nursing System (SNS), which allows you to feed formula to your baby formula through a pair of thin tubes you attach to your areola with surgical tape. Your baby nurses normally and gets a mix of formula and whatever breast milk you're producing. If you use this method, plan on supplementing with premixed or concentrated formula, not the the powdered version, which might have trouble going through the tubing if it's not mixed thoroughly.Another popular system is the Lact-Aid Nursing Trainer. It works like the Medela system but has soft, collapsible plastic bags instead of plastic bottles to hold the formula, making it possible to nurse your baby more discreetly. These supplementers have two functions: They ensure that your baby is getting enough food and they encourage nipple sucking, which triggers more breast milk production.It might be possible to use donor breast milk instead of formula. Because the demand for donated breast milk is higher than the supply, your baby may have to meet certain criteria. Talk with your baby's doctor to see whether you qualify.Where can I get more help?La Leche League International is one of the best resources for any nursing mother. La Leche can provide more information on this subject, and possibly connect you with other adoptive mothers in your area who are nursing. The group also has a few pamphlets about inducing lactation.Condon recommends the book Breastfeeding the Adopted Baby, by Debra Peterson. ""I bet a lot of adoptive moms have no idea this is something they can do,"" she says. ""If women knew they had the choice, I think a lot of them would try nursing."""
Iron-deficiency anemia in pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-deficiency-anemia-in-pregnancy_10414720.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWhat is iron-deficiency anemia?Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is a type of blood disorder. The red blood cells in your body contain hemoglobin, which is responsible for carrying oxygen throughout your body. Your body needs iron to build enough healthy red blood cells and keep your hemoglobin at the right level. If your body lacks the right amount of iron, you could become anemic.As a woman, it's not unusual to have anemia, especially when you're of childbearing age. Iron deficiency is by far the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy and accounts for 75 to 95 percent of all cases.But it's not the only cause: You could also develop anemia from not getting enough folic acid or vitamin B12, by losing a lot of blood, or from having certain diseases or inherited blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia.Am I at risk of becoming anemic?Yes. Pregnancy increases your likelihood of becoming anemic.During pregnancy, the recommended amount of iron increases from 18 milligrams (mg) per day to 27 mg per day. You need extra iron to support additional red blood cells, the placenta, and your growing baby. Plus, the extra iron prepares your body for any blood loss that may occur when you give birth.But there are other factors outside pregnancy that increase your risk further, including:Heavy menstrual periodsA diet low in iron-rich foodsA diet low in vitamin-C-rich foods (which help with iron absorption)Eating too many foods or drinks that reduce iron absorption (like dairy products, foods containing soy, coffee and tea)A short gap between pregnanciesBeing younger than 20 when you become pregnantHaving a stomach or intestinal disease that affects how your body absorbs nutrientsHaving certain types of gastric bypass surgery, which alters the gut and absorption of nutrientsTaking medication that affects the way your body absorbs iron from foodLosing more blood than normal when giving birth previouslyWhat are the symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia?You might not have any symptoms, especially if your anemia is mild. Sometimes tiredness is the only symptom you notice. And it's common to feel tired during pregnancy, so many women don't realize that a lack of iron is making them feel more tired than normal.Fatigue and weakness are the most common symptoms of severe anemia. Other symptoms include:Shortness of breathDizzinessHeadachePale complexionPalpitationsChest painIrritability or poor concentrationAn unpleasant urge to move your legs during periods of inactivity (restless legs syndrome)Leg crampsCraving nonfood items (pica) or ice to suck or chew onPale lips, inner eyelids, and the inside of your mouthSpoon-shaped nailsGlossy tongueCracks in the corners of your mouthHow is anemia diagnosed?At your first prenatal appointment, your provider will evaluate your medical history, give you a physical exam, and test your blood for anemia.One of the blood tests you'll have is a complete blood count (CBC). Among other things, the CBC measures:The percentage of red blood cells in your bloodstream (hematocrit or Hct)The amount of hemoglobin (Hgb or Hb) in those red blood cellsBlood test resultsThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control give guidelines for diagnosing anemia. In the first and third trimesters, an Hct less than 33 percent and an Hgb level less than 11 grams (g) of hemoglobin per deciliter (dL) of blood suggest anemia. In the second trimester, the levels are a little lower: 32 percent Hct and 10.5 g/dL Hgb.Your provider may follow up your CBC with more tests to determine if iron deficiency is the cause of your anemia.Even if you're not anemic at the start of your pregnancy, it's not unusual to develop anemia as your pregnancy progresses, so you may be tested again later on.How will anemia affect my pregnancy?It's normal to feel worried about being diagnosed with anemia, but mild anemia that's diagnosed and treated early shouldn't pose a problem during your pregnancy. Most experts agree that anemia in pregnancy is more of a concern if it's severe, untreated, or lasts a long time.If your provider advises you take iron supplements, and you take them as prescribed, your condition should improve. If you have a more severe case of anemia, you may be treated with IV iron supplements, or possibly even a blood transfusion if your hemoglobin falls to 6 g/dL or less.If you have severe anemia, and it doesn't get better with initial treatment, your healthcare provider may refer you to a specialist for care. You may need to see a hematologist or a maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist to figure out if another condition is causing your anemia.When you have a low level of iron, you may find yourself getting more tired or fatigued more easily during your pregnancy. Pregnancy can be exhausting anyway, so take extra care of yourself if you're feeling the added strain of having low iron.Will my baby be affected?A mild iron deficiency shouldn't affect your baby while you're pregnant. But research also suggests that mild iron-deficiency anemia that goes untreated and becomes more severe during pregnancy  especially in the first two trimesters  is linked to an increased risk of a baby being born with a low birth weight.Having severe iron-deficiency anemia may even increase the risk of stillbirth and newborn death.What can I do to have a healthy pregnancy?Let your provider know if you were diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia before you became pregnant. That way, she can manage your condition and treat you effectively during preconception and throughout your pregnancy.As with any pregnancy, go to all your appointments, take your prenatal vitamins, and follow the advice of your healthcare provider. She may suggest that you take iron supplements or modify the foods you eat.You can improve your anemia by eating iron-rich foods, such as shrimp, beef, turkey, enriched breakfast cereals, beans, and lentils. Foods that enhance iron absorption are also beneficial to include, such as orange juice, strawberries, broccoli, grapefruit, and peppers.Avoid consuming too many foods or drinks that prevent your body from absorbing iron properly, such as dairy products, soy products, coffee, and tea. If you do consume these foods or drinks, it may be best to have them an hour before or two hours after an iron-rich meal.Also, when you take an iron supplement, have it with a small snack. Eating a large amount of food hinders iron absorption.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources AAP and ACOG. 2012.

I have iron-deficiency anemia. How will it affect my baby?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_i-have-iron-deficiency-anemia-how-will-it-affect-my-baby_10414721.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWill my anemia affect my baby's development?If your iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is under control, your baby's development will likely not be affected by your condition. Most of the more serious problems associated with anemia only occur when the condition is untreated for a long time and becomes severe.By taking iron supplements during pregnancy, you not only treat your anemia, but may also reduce the risks to your baby. Iron supplements can help to improve your baby's iron levels too, which in turn helps to reduce the chance your baby develops iron-deficiency anemia.However, problems could occur if your iron levels aren't corrected during pregnancy.Severe anemia in the first two trimesters is linked to an increased risk that your baby may be born with a low birth weight. Your healthcare provider tests for anemia at your first prenatal appointment and will treat it if necessary.Does my anemia put my baby at risk of other complications?Possibly, yes, although the risk is thought to be low unless anemia is severe. Anemia is associated with increased risks of certain problems, like giving birth early.Severe anemia can also increase the risk of stillbirth and even newborn death. Since many women with anemia don't even realize they have it, its important to find out what your iron levels are.If you have mild anemia and taking supplements successfully raises your iron levels, then it's unlikely either you or your baby will have complications from IDA.Will my baby need extra care after he's born?If your baby was born preterm or with a low birth weight, he may need to spend some time in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).Preterm or low-birth weight babies have a higher risk of developing iron-deficiency anemia. However, your baby's anemia may not be related to yours: Preemies tend not to have as much iron stored in their bodies as larger, full-term babies. Your child's doctor may test your baby's blood to check for iron-deficiency anemia.If your baby is preterm or low-birth weight, he may need to be given additional iron. Although breastmilk and iron-enriched formula contain essential iron, your baby may need more iron than he can drink. If your baby needs it, he'll be given additional iron in the form of drops.Will my baby suffer any long-term effects from my anemia?It's understandable to worry about whether your anemia could have any long-term effects on your baby. But if your anemia is mild and under control, your baby is unlikely to suffer any long-term effects at all.A few small studies suggest a baby born to a mother with severe, untreated anemia may be slower to develop physically and mentally. However, it's relatively rare for women in the United States to have untreated, severe anemia.You can give your unborn baby a good start in life by attending all your prenatal appointments and working with your healthcare provider to manage your anemia. Take iron supplements as prescribed and eat plenty of iron-rich foods.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015a.

Leg cramps during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_leg-cramps-during-pregnancy_250.bc,"Why am I having leg cramps during pregnancy?No one really knows why pregnant women get more leg cramps. It's possible that your leg muscles are tired from carrying extra weight. Or cramps could be related to swelling from fluid buildup in your legs, a condition known as edema.(Legs often swell during pregnancy because the pressure of your expanding uterus slows the blood returning from your legs to your heart.)You may develop leg cramps during your second trimester, and they may get worse as your pregnancy progresses and your belly gets bigger. These cramps can occur during the day, but you'll probably notice them most at night because they can interfere with your ability to get a good night's sleep.How can I prevent leg cramps?There's no surefire way to prevent leg cramps, but these tips might help:Don't stand or sit with your legs crossed for long periods of time.Stretch your calf muscles regularly during the day and several times before you go to bed.Rotate your ankles and wiggle your toes whenever you sit down, eat dinner, or watch TV.Take a walkevery day, unless your provider has advised you not to exercise.Lie down on your left side to improve circulation to and from your legs.Drink water regularly to stay hydrated during the day.Try a warm bath before bed to relax your muscles.Some research suggests that taking amagnesiumsupplement in addition to a prenatal vitamin may help prevent leg cramps in some women. However, other research showed that taking magnesium supplements had no significant effect on the frequency or intensity of leg cramps during pregnancy.You may have heard that having leg cramps is a sign that you need more calcium, and that calcium supplements will relieve the problem. Though it's certainly important to get enoughcalcium, there's no good evidence that taking extra calcium will help prevent leg cramps during pregnancy. In one well-designed study, pregnant women taking calcium got no more relief from leg cramps than those taking a placebo.Always check with your provider before taking any kind of supplement during pregnancy.What's the best way to relieve a leg cramp when I get one?When you get a cramp, immediately stretch your calf muscles: Straighten your leg, heel first, and gently flex your toes back toward your shins. It might hurt at first, but it will ease the spasm and gradually the pain will go away.Don't point your toes while stretching. It can make the muscle contract and worsen the cramp.You can try to relax the cramp by massaging the muscle or warming it with a hot water bottle. Walking around for a few minutes may help too.What should I do if I keep getting leg cramps?Call your healthcare provider if:Muscle pain is constant and not just an occasional cramp.You notice swelling,redness, or tenderness in your leg.Your leg feels warm to the touch.These may be signs of a blood clot, which requires immediate medical attention. Blood clots are relatively rare, but they're more common during pregnancy.Show sources Hide sources AOFAS. Undated. Foot changes during pregnancy.

Vitamin C in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-c-in-your-pregnancy-diet_660.bc,"Why you need vitamin C during pregnancyBoth you and your baby need vitamin C daily because it's necessary for the body to make collagen, a structural protein that's a component of cartilage, tendons, bones, and skin. Based on animal studies, some researchers believe that vitamin C deficiencies in newborn babies can impair mental development.Also known as ascorbic acid, vitamin C is essential for tissue repair, wound healing, bone growth and repair, and healthy skin. Vitamin C helps your body fight infections and acts as an antioxidant, protecting cells from damage.Vitamin C also helps your body absorbiron, especially from vegetarian sources.How much vitamin C you needPregnant women age 18 and younger: 80 milligrams (mg) per dayPregnant women age 19 and older: 85 mg per dayBreastfeeding women age 18 and younger: 115 mg per dayBreastfeeding women age 19 and older: 120 mg per dayNonpregnant women age 18 and younger: 65 mg per dayNonpregnant women age 19 and older: 75 mg per dayFood sources of vitamin CCitrus fruits are especially high in vitamin C, but leafy greens and many other fruits and vegetables are also excellent sources. Choose fresh foods as your source of vitamin C because heat can destroy this vitamin. Also, some cereals and juices are fortified with vitamin C.Try to include a food rich in vitamin C at every meal to maximize the amount of iron you get from the other foods you eat.Foods that provide vitamin C include:6 ounces orange juice: 62 to 93 mg6 ounces grapefruit juice: 62 to 70 mgone kiwi: 91 mg1/2 cup raw, sweet red bell pepper, chopped: 95 mg1 cup whole strawberries: 85 mgone medium orange: 70 mg1/2 cup broccoli, cooked: 51 mg1/2 medium grapefruit: 38 mgone medium baked potato: 17 mgone medium tomato: 16 mg1 cup raw spinach: 8 mgShould you take a vitamin C supplement?Probably not. It's easiest and safest to get your daily requirement from food. A glass of orange juice at breakfast every day is all you need. (Choose calcium-fortified OJ for even more nutritional value.)Although some studies show that vitamin C supplementation can reduce the incidence of premature rupture of the membranes (PROM), there is some concern that taking vitamin C supplements during pregnancy may raise the risk ofpreterm birth.There are also reports (though rare) of babies born to mothers who took excessive vitamin C supplements during pregnancy developing scurvy, a severe vitamin C deficiency.If you're concerned about your vitamin C intake, talk with your healthcare provider.The signs of a vitamin C deficiencySigns of a deficiency include fatigue, gum inflammation, slow-healing cuts, bruises, and rough, dry skin.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014.

Diet for a healthy breastfeeding mom,https://www.babycenter.com/0_diet-for-a-healthy-breastfeeding-mom_3565.bc,"Many new moms wonder how breastfeeding will affect their diet. You probably don't need to make any major changes to what you eat or drink when you're nursing, though there are a few important considerations to keep in mind:Eat a well-balanced diet for your healthOne of the wonders of breast milk is that it can meet your baby's nutritional needs even when you're not eating perfectly. (However, if your diet is too low in calories or relies on one food group at the exclusion of others, this could affect the quality and quantity of your milk.)Just because your baby won't be harmed by your occasional dietary lapses doesn't mean that you won't suffer. When you don't get the nutrients you need from your diet, your body draws on its reserves, which can eventually become depleted. Also, you need strength and stamina to meet the physical demands of caring for a new baby.Many breastfeeding moms feel extra hungry, which makes sense: Your body is working around the clock to make breast milk for your baby. Eating small meals with healthy snacks in between  the way you may have done during pregnancy  is a good way to keep your hunger in check and your energy level high.Breastfeeding lessons learned: 5 things I never knew Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 6:21Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -6:21Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

A filmmaker and mother of two shares what she wants new moms to know. See all baby videosDon't count caloriesThere's no single answer to how many calories a nursing mom needs. But in general, most women who are breastfeeding need about 500 calories more than moms who aren't  that's a total of 2,000 to 2,500 calories per day.Instead of counting calories, follow your hunger as a guide to how much you need to eat.The exact amount depends on a number of individual factors, such as your weight, how much exercise you get, how your metabolism works, and how frequently you're breastfeeding.If you're concerned about putting on excess pounds, talk to your healthcare provider about your body mass index and what you can do to maintain a healthy weight. How to use a breast pumpLearn about the different types of breast pumps, the basics of how they work, and the right way to use a breast pump.Aim for slow and steady weight lossSome new moms find the weight just seems to fall off, while others don't lose much. It all depends on your body, your food choices, your activity level, and your metabolism.The best plan: Lose your pregnancy weight gradually. Plan to take up to a year to get back to your pre-pregnancy weight.Don't try to lose weight by dieting until at least two months after your baby is born. A reduced-calorie diet in the first couple of months could sap your energy and diminish your milk supply.If you're overweight or obese, you may be able to start trying to shed pounds earlier but first ask your doctor for advice. And be sure to stay hydrated  sometimes dieters cut back on water when they eat less food.Most women can safely lose 1 pound each week by combining a healthy diet with moderate exercise.A sudden, large drop in your calorie intake can affect your milk supply, so don't go on a crash diet to lose weight quickly. If you're losing more than 1 pound a week after the first six weeks, that's a sign you need to take in more calories. Include a variety of healthy foodsVariety and balance are key to a healthy diet. Eating a mix of carbohydrates protein, and fat at meals keeps you feeling full longer and supplies the nutrients your body needs.Complex carbs like whole grains and cereals and fresh fruits and vegetables not only provide more nutrition than processed starches and sugars, they provide longer-lasting energy. And choosing from all food groups is important so you can get the vitamins you and your baby need over time. So mix it up  try to eat something today that you didn't eat yesterday. Strawberry and asparagus saladThis spinach salad topped with asparagus, strawberries, and pistachios is perfect as a light lunch.Choose good fatsWhen it comes to fat, think mono- and polyunsaturated fats. Sources of these ""healthy fats"" include canola oil, olive oil, and fatty fish (like salmon) as well as avocados, olives, nuts, and seeds.Limit saturated fats and avoid trans fats, both of which are considered unhealthy. Saturated fats show up in high-fat meats, whole milk, tropical oils (such as palm kernel and coconut), butter, and lard. Partially hydrogenated oils contain trans fats. Saturated fats and trans fats are both listed on a product's nutrition label.In addition to being bad for your diet, getting too much of these unhealthy fats can alter the fat composition of your breast milk, which isn't good for your baby's health.While we don't know the long-term effects of unhealthy fats on infant cardiovascular health, we do know that in adults these fats negatively affect heart health by raising LDL (bad cholesterol), lowering HDL (good cholesterol), and increasing signs of inflammation. Unhealthy fats also boost the risk of heart attack and death from heart disease.Breastfeeding Problem SolverFind solutions to a variety of breastfeeding challenges, including nipple pain, low milk supply, and more.Take extra steps to avoid contaminantsIt's a good idea to try to minimize your exposure to contaminants in your food (and your environment) while you're nursing. Pesticides, insecticides, and other chemicals that you ingest can make their way into your breast milk.Although research is ongoing, we know that environmental chemicals could affect your baby's long-term health. Here are some tips for limiting your exposure:Eat a variety of foods. If you eat large quantities of one food that happens to be high in pesticides, your intake of pesticides will be higher than if that food is just one of many that you eat.Know which fruits and vegetables are highest in pesticides, and choose organic options if possible. Always wash fruits and veggies well. Or better yet, peel them. As of 2011 the ""dirty dozen"" that tested highest for pesticides, according to the Environmental Working Group, were apples, celery, strawberries, peaches, spinach, imported nectarines and grapes, sweet bell peppers, potatoes, blueberries, lettuce, and kale and collard greens.The fruits and vegetables that had the lowest amount of pesticide residue were onions, sweet corn, pineapples, avocados, asparagus, sweet peas, mangoes, eggplant, cantaloupe, kiwi, cabbage, watermelon, sweet potatoes, grapefruit, and mushrooms.Choose produce that's in season in your area, and buy local when you can. Produce that travels long distances often have more pesticides.Choose lean meats, and remove the skin and extra fat before cooking. Chemicals are stored in fat.Consider drinking filtered water while breastfeeding. The EPA requires that all tap water meet certain standards, but small amounts of many chemicals are found in tap water. Eat fish  but be pickyWhen you're nursing, it's important to get protein from a variety of sources  including fish. The American Heart Association recommends fish for a heart-healthy diet.Some fish (especially cold water fish) also contain DHA and EPA, omega-3 fats that play an important role in the brain and eye development that continues during your baby's first year. (Your baby gets these omega-3s from your breast milk.)Not only does DHA help your baby, but it helps you too. Research suggests that moms who have lower levels of DHA, as well as lower seafood consumption, are more likely to develop postpartum depression.Eat up to 12 ounces of most types of fish and seafood per week, including salmon, shrimp, canned light tuna, lake trout, tilapia, catfish, crab, pollack, and scallops.If you don't like seafood, try an omega-3 supplement. Just be sure to talk to your healthcare provider first to find out how much to take.Also, be aware that some types of fish contain contaminants that can be harmful to pregnant and nursing women and children. The Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Department of Agriculture advise not eating shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury.Solid white or albacore tuna tends to be higher in mercury than other types of canned tuna. If you eat solid white or albacore tuna, limit your intake to 6 ounces per week.Other experts and advocacy groups are even more cautious, expanding the list of fish to avoid. Read more about eating fish when you're breastfeeding. Pan-fried salmon with baby leaf saladSeared salmon served over a bed of ripe tomatoes and baby leaf salad.Go easy on the alcoholIf you time it right, an occasional drink probably won't harm your breastfeeding baby, but in general you may want to hold off on drinking alcohol while you're breastfeeding. Alcohol does enter your breast milk, and having as little as one drink may affect your milk letdown reflex.Studies show that babies consume less milk in the four hours after you have an alcoholic beverage. And your baby may become drowsy and fall asleep more quickly after you have a drink, but he'll also sleep for a shorter amount of time. (And, of course, heavy drinking makes you unable to safely care for your baby.)If you're going to enjoy an occasional alcoholic beverage, keep in mind that it takes two to three hours for your body to eliminate the alcohol in one serving of beer or wine. Specific time frames depend on your size and how much you drink, but the more you drink the longer it takes your body to get rid of it. So you might want to time that toast for right after a feeding session.Alcohol isn't stored in breast milk  instead, the level increases and decreases just as it does in your bloodstream. If you have an alcoholic drink, wait at least two hours before breastfeeding your baby or you may need to ""pump and dump."" If you plan to have a drink with alcohol, either breastfeed your baby or express your milk first and store it for later.If you're a breastfeeding mom who supplements late-night feedings with formula, another option is to wait until your baby goes down for the night before you drink alcohol.Also, drink water with your alcoholic drink, and eat before (or while) you drink to help lower the amount of alcohol in your blood and your milk. Drink plenty of water and limit caffeineWhen you're breastfeeding, your body needs plenty of fluid, but there's no need to keep a record of how much you drink. A good guideline to follow is drink to satisfy thirst  that is, drink whenever you feel the need. If your urine is clear or light yellow, it's a good sign that you're well hydrated.Speaking of fluids, it's okay to have your morning cup of coffee while breastfeeding if you like, but don't overdo it. A small amount of caffeine winds up in your breast milk, and it can accumulate in your baby's system because she can't easily break it down and excrete it.Most experts suggest that nursing moms limit their consumption of caffeine (including coffee, tea, soft drinks, energy drinks, chocolate, and coffee ice cream) to no more than 300 mg per day. That's about as much as you'd get in three 5-ounce cups of coffee. You may want to drink even less if you're nursing a newborn or preterm baby. Check out our caffeine chart to see how much caffeine is in popular beverages and foods.Consider the flavors of what you eat and drinkMost nursing moms can eat a wide variety of foods while nursing  including spicy foods  without any objection from their baby. In fact, some experts believe that babies enjoy a variety of flavors in their breast milk. Eating your favorite foods while you're nursing gives your baby a ""taste"" of your diet and may help him accept different foods once he starts eating solids.But some moms swear that certain foods  like broccoli, cabbage, brussels sprouts, dairy products, chocolate, citrus, garlic, or chili pepper  make their breastfed baby gassy or irritable. If your baby seems consistently uncomfortable after you eat a particular food, then by all means avoid it to see if your baby is happier.In rare instances, your baby may be allergic to something you've eaten. If this is the case, you may notice a reaction on his skin (rash or hives), in his breathing (wheezing or congestion), or in his stools (green or mucousy). Keep taking your vitaminsIt's a good idea to continue taking your prenatal vitamin while you're breastfeeding  at least for the first month or so. After that, you can switch to a regular multivitamin and mineral supplement or stay on your prenatal vitamin, depending on your individual needs. (You can discuss this with your healthcare provider at your first postpartum visit.)A supplement doesn't take the place of a well-balanced diet, but it can provide some extra insurance on those days when taking care of your new baby keeps you from eating as well as you'd like.In addition to your prenatal vitamin or multivitamin, consider taking the following supplements:Calcium: While your prenatal vitamin or multivitamin may have small amounts of calcium, but you'll need supplemental calcium if you're not eating at least three daily servings of calcium-rich foods (like milk and other dairy products, canned fish, or calcium-fortified foods like cereals, juices, soy and rice beverages, and breads).The recommended dose for women before, during, and after pregnancy is 1,000 milligrams (mg) daily. (Teenage mothers need 1,300 mg daily.)Don't get more than 2,500 mg daily from all sources. Exceeding this safe upper limit can lead to kidney stones, hypercalcemia, and renal insufficiency syndrome. It can also interfere with your body's absorption of iron, magnesium, phosphorus, and zinc.If you're going to take calcium, also be sure to supplement with vitamin D.Vitamin D: This vitamin is important for bone growth and overall health. Vitamin D also helps your body absorb calcium, and research suggests it may lower the risk of osteoporosis, high blood pressure, diabetes, and several autoimmune diseases.Sun exposure helps your body produce vitamin D, but many women don't get enough sun (especially in the winter and with the use of sunscreen) to make an adequate amount, and experts think the small amount found in food might not be enough. The best way to know whether you're getting enough vitamin D is to have your blood tested.The 2010 U.S. Dietary Guidelines and Institute of Medicine both recommend that all women get 600 IU (15 micrograms) of vitamin D daily, but no more than 4,000 IU. Very large amounts of vitamin D  more than 10,000 IU daily  may cause kidney and tissue damage.By the way, breast milk doesn't supply your baby with enough vitamin D. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that babies who are exclusively breastfed or who drink less than 32 ounces of formula daily receive a supplement of 400 IU (10 micrograms) of vitamin D each day too. Talk to your baby's doctor about a vitamin D supplement.Vitamin D is important for bone development and the prevention of rickets in children. Experts think that getting enough vitamin D in childhood may also help prevent certain conditions, like osteoarthritis, from developing later in life.DHA: The DHA content of your breast milk depends on your diet, particularly on whether you eat fish. So if your diet doesn't contain a few servings of cold water fish or other food containing DHA (like fortified eggs) every week, you might consider a supplement.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfeeding moms get 200 to 300 mg of DHA a day.Daily food and meal plans for breastfeeding momsChart of daily food group servings for breastfeeding moms.Sample meal plans for breastfeeding moms.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Calcium in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_calcium-in-your-childs-diet_10324689.bc,"Calcium is crucial for good health and development. Read on to find out how much calcium your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Why calcium is importantCalcium is vital for building strong bones and teeth, promoting nerve and muscle function, helping blood clot, and activating the enzymes that convert food into energy. About 99 percent of the body's calcium is stored in the teeth and bones. And because children are growing new bone all the time, they need a steady supply of calcium to support healthy growth.How much calcium does your child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 700 milligrams (mg) per dayAges 4 to 8 years: 1,000 mg per dayYour child doesn't have to get the recommended amount of calcium every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of calciumDairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese are some of the best sources of calcium, but you'll also find it in some unexpected places. Here are some calcium-rich foods to try:1/4 cup raw tofu prepared with calcium sulfate: 217 mg (The calcium content of tofu varies, depending on how it's processed. Check the label.)1/2 cup plain yogurt: 207 mg1 tablespoon blackstrap molasses: 172 mg1/2 cup fruit yogurt: 122 to 192 mg1/2 cup calcium-fortified orange juice: 133 to 250 mg1/4 cup ricotta cheese: 167 mg1/2 cup milk: 150 mg1/2 cup chocolate milk: 144 mg1/2 ounce Swiss cheese: 112 mg1/2 cup vanilla frozen yogurt, soft-serve: 102 mg1/2 ounce cheddar cheese: 102 mg1 slice whole grain bread: 24 mg1/2 ounce mozzarella cheese: 103 mg1/4 cup collard greens: 66 mg1/4 cup homemade pudding (from mix or scratch): 76 mg1 tablespoon tahini (sesame seed butter): 64 mg1/4 cup turnip greens: 50 mg1/4 cup cooked spinach: 60 mg1/2 cup calcium-fortified cereal (ready to eat): 51 mg1/2 cup calcium-fortified soy beverage: 40 to 250 mgThe amount of calcium a food contains varies somewhat, depending on the brand, the size of the fruit or vegetable, and so on. Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, depending on their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Calcium content isn't affected by fat, but the dietary fat in dairy products plays an important role in your child's development. Children younger than 2 need to get half their calories from fat for healthy growth and brain development, so they should eat only full-fat dairy products. But unless your doctor advises otherwise, children older than 2 need to get fewer calories from fat, so they should eat low-fat or nonfat dairy products to maintain a healthy weight.Tips for maximizing your child's calcium intakeSome experts believe that many children are falling short of their calcium requirement. This could be partly because juice and other nondairy drinks are so popular that kids are drinking less milk. Here are some simple steps you can take to make sure your child gets enough calcium:Use milk instead of water when preparing cereal, hot cocoa, and soup.Use evaporated milk in place of regular milk in recipes  it has twice the calcium of regular milk.Add yogurt to fruit salads; nonfat milk powder to pancake batter, sauces, and smoothies; and cheese to vegetables, sauces, and mashed potatoes.Buy calcium-fortified juice, bread, and cereal.Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, so make sure your child gets enough vitamin D  about 600 international units (IU) per day.Can your child get too much calcium?An extremely high level of calcium in the blood is usually due to an underlying medical condition rather than consuming too much calcium in food and supplements. The Institute of Medicine recommends that kids age 1 to 8 get no more than 2,500 mg of calcium daily  that's roughly the equivalent of eight 8-ounce glasses of milk. While it's a good idea to keep an eye on how much calcium your child gets from her diet, it's unlikely that she will get too much calcium from food alone.Calcium supplements, on the other hand, can sometimes be a problem. For instance, taking excess calcium supplements has been linked to a higher risk of kidney stones.A couple of notes of caution: If your child is a big milk drinker, make sure she's not getting too many extra calories from milk alone, or that she doesn't fill up on milk and then have no appetite for other healthy foods. Also, too much calcium can cause constipation.Find out more: Nine other important nutrients for childrenShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2013. Dietary fat and toddlers.

4 key nutrients you may be missing,https://www.babycenter.com/0_4-key-nutrients-you-may-be-missing_10352387.bc,"In a perfect world, we'd get all the nutrients we need from well-balanced home-cooked meals. Unfortunately, with today's jam-packed schedules and on-the-go dining, we're likely to fall short on critical nutrients.Revamp your diet to make sure you include the following key nutrients and you'll not only function better, you'll help stave off disease and may even extend your life.Omega-3sResearch shows that consuming a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the risk of heart disease. Omega-3s DHA and EPA do this by helping prevent irregular heartbeats, reducing plaque buildup and inflammation in the arteries, and keeping blood sugar levels in check.Need more reasons to load up on omega-3s? Researchers from the National Institutes of Health report that they're more effective at combating depression than commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs.Where to find them:Fatty fish like salmon, trout, and sardines. (Some plant foods contain the omega-3 ALA, but this fatty acid hasn't been proven to provide the health benefits of DHA and EPA.) Eating just one or two servings of fatty fish a week can slash your risk of dying from heart disease by 36 percent. Not into fish? Take a supplement.Vitamin DFor years, scientists thought vitamin D's only role was to enhance the absorption of calcium from food. New research shows that vitamin D can reduce chronic pain, ease PMS, guard against heart disease, and even ward off cancer.Trouble is, most of us don't get enough vitamin D to maintain bone health, let alone reach the levels that protect against chronic disease. People used to get a lot of vitamin D from sunlight. Nowadays we protect ourselves from the sun, and our vitamin D levels have declined as a result. What's more, experts say the current daily recommendation of 400 IU is too low, and that most Americans need a minimum of 1,000 IU of vitamin D every day, especially in the absence of sunlight.Where to find it:It may be difficult to get all of the vitamin D you need by loading up on vitamin D-rich foods like salmon and fortified milk and cereal. To get the recommended 1,000 IU, look for supplements that contain vitamin D (cholecalciferol), an active form that's more effective than its vitamin D2 counterpart.FiberDietary fiber fills you up without weighing you down, helps keep blood sugar levels in check, and helps prevent health problems ranging from cancer to stroke. Even though the nutrient is widely available in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, most Americans get very little. Our average intake is a paltry 14 grams per day, compared to the recommended 25 to 35 grams.""People are spending less money at the supermarket and more money at fast food joints that don't serve high-fiber meals,"" says Milton Stokes, research assistant at the University of Connecticut and founder of One Source Nutrition in Stamford. ""Not only does this increase the chance of constipation  an ailment that affects more than 4 million Americans  it also can lead to weight gain.""Where to find it:Fortunately, fiber is easy to find. Oatmeal, beans, barley, and most fruits and vegetables (especially apples, berries, and broccoli) are chock full of the stuff. If you're adding fiber to your diet, make sure to boost your water intake, too. A sudden increase in fiber consumption without water can cause bloating, constipation, and other tummy troubles.CalciumWhile the ""Got milk?"" campaign has done an excellent job of reminding us that calcium-rich foods promote strong bones, it fails to mention the many other roles calcium has. In fact, getting enough calcium can help prevent diseases ranging from diabetes and cancer to hypertension and heart disease.""Calcium is important for muscle function, not just bone health,"" says Christine Gerbstadt, national spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. ""The heart is a muscle and it needs calcium, too."" Only 21 percent of adults get the recommended amount of calcium (1,000 mg per day for women 19 to 50, and 1,200 mg for women 51 and over).Where to find it:According to Gerbstadt, two to three servings of dairy every day should meet your needs.

Pregnant with multiples: Nutrition and fitness needs,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pregnant-with-multiples-nutrition-and-fitness-needs_3580.bc,"Do I need to eat more if I'm pregnant with multiples?Yes. If you're pregnant with multiples, you need more calories than a woman who's carrying just one baby.A general guideline is to add 300 calories a day for each baby. So if you're carrying twins, you'd add roughly 600 calories to your usual diet. This amount may be different if you were overweight or underweight before you got pregnant, so talk with your provider to come up with an eating plan that has the number of calories that's appropriate for you.Whether you're carrying twins, triplets, or more, plan to eatat least five times a day(three meals and two substantial snacks), even if you don't feel especially hungry.Of course,not all calories are created equal. Make each one count by limiting sugar and eating a variety of foodspacked with the nutrients you need, including protein, carbohydrates, andfats. Cheese, milk, meat, eggs, nuts, and healthy oils all fuel your babies' growth. Round out your diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains.How much weight should I gain if I'm pregnant with multiples?Gaining the right amount of weight is necessary to nourish your growing babies. Try to put on pounds starting early in the pregnancy  when your babies are developing rapidly and you still have room to fill your stomach. The Institute of Medicine (IOM) recommends the following weight gain ranges for women carrying twins based on their pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI):37 to 54 pounds if you started at a normal weight (BMI of 18.5 to 24.9)31 to 50 pounds if you were overweight (BMI of 25 to 29.9)25 to 42 pounds if you were obese (BMI of 30 or higher)According to the IOM, there isn't enough data to make weight gain recommendations for women pregnant with triplets or more. If you're expecting three or more babies, ask your provider for a weight gain target that's right for you.If you were underweight before pregnancy, you'll have to put on extra weight quickly to catch up. Your provider can help you set healthy weight goals throughout your pregnancy. Live birth: TwinsFollow one woman through her pregnancy with twins and watch her give birth.Will I need to take a special kind of prenatal vitamin?Prenatal vitamins are important, but you don't need a special formula for twins and triplets. A standardprenatal supplementwill do just fine.A supplement is the best way to ensure that you get vital nutrients such as folic acid,iron, andcalcium. Your provider can recommend specific brands and doses.Women carrying more than one baby are at a higher risk foriron-deficiency anemiaduring pregnancy. Your provider will monitor your iron level to make sure you're getting enough. If you're not, she may recommend that you take an iron supplement.High doses of iron can sometimes lead to constipation andnausea, so talk to your provider about ways to avoid these problems.How much water do I need if I'm pregnant with multiples?Even if you're the type of person who never goes anywhere without a water bottle, pay extra attention to how much water you're drinking now that you're carrying multiples. Women who are pregnant with one baby are advised to drink 10 8-ounce cups of water (or other hydrating beverages) each day, so that's probably a good starting point for you too.But every woman is different  you may need a little more or less water than someone else. Ask your provider for specific advice on fluid intake.Of course, drinking extra fluids means you'll be making extra trips to the bathroom (especially as your babies grow larger), but you can use this as a chance to check if you're hydrated. Aim to drink enough water to keep your urine clear or pale yellow. If it's cloudy or dark yellow, drink more.It's especially important to prevent dehydration in the second half of pregnancy because having multiples can raise the risk ofpremature labor and early delivery.Can I exercise if I'm pregnant with multiples?If you're a healthy, active woman with multiples on the way, you can probably continue to exercise during your pregnancy, as long as your provider gives you the go-ahead.Keep it slow, relaxed, and gentle. Your body  and your babies  may not be able to handle intense workouts. Good options includeswimming,walking, andprenatal yoga.Be sure you're hydrated before, during, and after your workout. And no matter what exercise you enjoy, stop immediately if you develop signs of overheating, such as nausea, dizziness, or a racing heart.That said, carrying more than one baby is a workout in itself, and some women may need to commit to extra rest or avoid doing certain types of exercise. For example, aerobic exercise may be off-limits if you're at risk of delivering your baby early.Discuss your workout routine with your provider to make sure you and your baby stay healthy during your pregnancy, and be sure to tell your provider if you develop signs of preterm labor, such as abdominal pain or bleeding. Preterm labor is a reason for you to stop exercising altogether.Learn more:Pregnant with multiples: Prenatal careTwins fetal development month by monthNational Organization of Mothers of Twins ClubsShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

Cystic fibrosis in children,https://www.babycenter.com/0_cystic-fibrosis-in-children_11422.bc,"What is cystic fibrosis?Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disease. A child with CF has a faulty gene that affects the movement of sodium chloride (salt) in and out of certain cells.The result is thick, heavy, sticky mucus; salty sweat; and thickened digestive juices. The thick mucus secretions can clog the lungs, making a child with CF very prone to breathing difficulties, lung infections (the mucus provides a rich environment for bacteria), and, eventually, severe lung damage. And when thickened digestive fluids from the child's pancreas can't get to the small intestine to break down and absorb nutrients from the food he eats, he may also have digestive and growth problems.What are the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis in children?Poor growth is one of the first signs of CF. Parents may also notice a nagging cough and wheezing. Coughing and wheezing are hardly unique to children with CF, of course. These symptoms could be caused by viral bronchiolitis (an inflammation of the small breathing tubes), asthma, or even a dusty, smoky environment. Each of these conditions is far more common than any genetic disease.Still, cystic fibrosis is the most common life-shortening genetic disease among people of Northern European descent. Other symptoms include salty skin, a big appetite with no weight gain, and large, greasy stools.Sometimes the condition doesn't become apparent until a child has had a series of repeated lung infections or severe growth problems. If your child has any of these symptoms, talk with her doctor.Cystic fibrosis can't be cured, but there are new treatments that can not only prolong a child's life but may also help make that life more normal. And the earlier cystic fibrosis is diagnosed, the more effective those therapies will be.How common is cystic fibrosis?The chances of your child having CF are about 1 in 3,000 if your child is Caucasian, 1 in 9,000 if he's Hispanic, 1 in 11,000 if he's Native American, 1 in 15,000 if he's of African heritage, and 1 in 30,000 if he's Asian American.Children get cystic fibrosis when they inherit one defective CF gene from their mother and another from their father. (More than 10 million Americans carry the CF gene  most without knowing it.) Children with the disease are usually diagnosed before the age of 2, but about 10 percent of cases go undetected until adulthood.How can I find out whether my child has CF?The definitive test for CF is something called a sweat test. This test is quick and painless: A drug called pilocarpine stimulates a spot on the arm to sweat. The doctor places a piece of filter paper on the area to absorb the sweat and then tests its sodium and chloride content. Higher than normal levels strongly suggest cystic fibrosis. A family history of CF and other tests, such as a chest X-ray and blood or saliva genetic tests, may add to the evidence.How is the disease treated?Children with cystic fibrosis need ongoing medical care. This is best provided at a specialized CF center with a team of doctors, nurses, and others who have expertise with the disease. Symptoms vary greatly from child to child, even when they are siblings with the same genetic defect. Often symptoms come and go  they may be relatively mild or frighteningly severe.The vast majority of young children with CF can be treated as outpatients, but they need to be seen frequently to make sure the disease is being treated properly. At each visit a sputum (saliva or mucus) sample is taken to help determine which germs are causing lung infections. Occasionally, if symptoms flare up, the child has to be admitted to the hospital to get intravenous antibiotics.If your child has cystic fibrosis, he should receive routine childhood vaccines against such common illnesses as Hib and pertussis and an annual flu shot.Most children with CF are given prescription medications, including antibiotics to treat infection, medicines that help break up mucus in the lungs, and drugs that reduce the inflammation that causes lung destruction. Each child responds best to a different combination of physical and drug therapies, and it's the job of the doctors and the parents to find the right mix. Parents play an important role by watching how their children respond to different drugs.Researchers are working to develop other treatment options as well, including gene therapy (to replace the gene that causes the disease), drugs that help move salt in and out of the cells properly, and new drugs to prevent and treat infections.To loosen mucus in your child's lungs, his doctor will probably show you how to thump your child's chest with a cupped hand. You may need to do this a couple of times each day for about 30 minutes each time. There are also electric devices  like a chest clapper and a vibrating vest  that can perform this task.Because the disease usually gums up the pancreas, your child will need help with his digestion as well. Without easy access to pancreatic enzymes, the small intestine has trouble breaking down food, especially fat, leaving children with CF undernourished and hungry. Much of what they eat passes through their body without being absorbed.The doctor may decide that your child needs to take a pancreatic enzyme supplement with every meal to help his body absorb the food he eats. (You'll need to open the capsule and mix the tiny beads with a little food.) You'll want to encourage your child to eat as frequently as possible and give him any nutritional supplements the doctor recommends.Proper nutrition is vital because a child who is otherwise strong, healthy, and well nourished gives all the CF therapies a better chance to provide some relief. Your child's doctor will determine exactly which supplements  and how much of them  your child needs to take.The good news is that, in many cases, children with CF can lead nearly normal lives, going to school with everyone else, playing on the playground, and being a kid, even if the adults around him are being more vigilant. The prospects for children with cystic fibrosis keep getting better: Several decades ago most children with CF died by their teens. Today, the life expectancy of a child born with cystic fibrosis is about 37 years. Where can I find more information about cystic fibrosis?The universe of people with cystic fibrosis and their loved ones is large, well informed, and supportive. Here are some of the best websites to explore:Visit the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, a central clearinghouse for information, advocacy, and support.For a weekly summary of research information, go to Cystic Fibrosis Research.See an excellent source for new drugs now under investigation for CF therapy.Share your concerns about your child's condition and trade tips with other parents at the Children With Cystic Fibrosis BabyCenter Community Group.Show sources Hide sources Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

Iron-deficiency anemia: Understanding your blood test results,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-deficiency-anemia-understanding-your-blood-test-results_10414727.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWhat tests will I have for anemia?The first test you may have that can identify anemia is called a complete blood count (CBC). You'll have a CBC at your first prenatal appointment, and the results of that will determine which other tests, if any, you'll need to find the cause of your anemia.Your healthcare provider will take a sample of blood to do the CBC. This test measures various aspects of blood, but when it's used to diagnose anemia, the CBC checks the average size of your red blood cells as well as hematocrit and hemoglobin levels.Hemoglobin is an iron-rich protein in your red blood cells that transports oxygen throughout your body. The CBC also analyzes the grams of hemoglobin (Hb or Hgb) you have in your blood.For your hematocrit (Hct), the CBC measures what percentage of total blood volume is made up of red blood cells.Although the CBC can indicate that you're anemic, the test can't identify the cause. However, a lack of dietary iron is the most common cause of anemia during pregnancy, so your healthcare provider will probably start you on iron supplements right away.If your Hct and Hgb levels rise after a few weeks of taking iron supplements, that's a sign your anemia was caused by iron deficiency. If they don't go up, your provider will do additional tests.A blood test called a serum ferritin test is thought to be the most sensitive test for confirming and measuring iron-deficiency anemia. Ferritin is a protein that helps your body store iron. By measuring your level of this protein, your provider can see how much of the iron stored in your body has been used.Another common blood test called hemoglobin electrophoresis can identify conditions related to faulty hemoglobin, like sickle cell anemia.Many women don't know they have anemia until they're evaluated at the first prenatal appointment. But if your provider is aware that you have a history of anemia, she'll do a CBC and other tests to measure levels of ferritin and other substances in your blood (see below) to determine whether it's IDA.How often will I have a blood test for anemia?If you have mild anemia, you'll have a follow-up blood test during your second or third trimester. The rest of your care will be standard prenatal care.If your anemia is severe or you have very low iron levels, your provider might test your blood more regularly or refer you to a specialist. You could have a test as often as every month, so your provider can monitor your anemia and see if treatment with iron supplementation treatment is working.What do the results mean?When you see the results of your blood test, the numbers can be confusing. Discussing the results with your provider can clarify what the numbers mean and the implications for you and your baby. A normal result for someone else might not be a normal result for you.In general, here's what a blood test measures and how the results are reported:Complete blood count (CBC)Hemoglobin (Hgb or Hb) levels are reported in grams (g) per deciliter (dL). So an Hgb level of 11 g/dL means you have 11 grams of hemoglobin in a deciliter of your blood.(A gram is about one thirtieth of an ounce. A deciliter is just over three fluid ounces.)The hematocrit (Hct) test results are reported as a percentage. This represents how much of your blood is made up of red blood cells. So if your Hct is 33 percent, it means that about one-third of your blood is made up of red blood cells.In pregnancy, anemia is diagnosed when:In the first trimester, your Hgb levels are below 11 g/dL, or your Hct is less than 33 percent.In the second trimester, your Hgb levels are below 10.5 g/dL, or your Hct is less than 32 percent.In the third trimester, your Hgb levels are below 11 g/dL, or your Hct levels are less than 33 percent.The levels go down slightly as your pregnancy progresses because the amount of blood in your body is expanding dramatically, and the amount of plasma (the fluid component of blood) increases faster than the number and size of red blood cells.Anemia is usually considered mild or severe. However, there aren't precise definitions for severity of anemia. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists only defines severe anemia as a hemoglobin level of less than 6 g/dL.The measurements used to define anemia might not be the same for everyone. For example, women of African American descent have naturally lower hemoglobin levels than Caucasian women.Mean corpuscular volumeThe mean corpuscular volume (MCV) is a blood test that helps pinpoint the cause of anemia. The MCV identifies the size of red blood cells to classify conditions like thalassemia (an inherited blood disorder), iron-deficiency anemia, and sepsis (a blood infection).Serum ferritin testFor a serum ferritin test, the results are shown in micrograms (mcg) per liter (L). A ferritin level of 10 mcg/L means that there are 10 micrograms of ferritin in 1 liter of blood.A microgram is a tiny measurement of weight. There are one million micrograms in a gram. You may also see your ferritin level written as ng/mL. This means nanogram (ng) per milliliter (mL). A nanogram is an even smaller unit of measurement: It's one thousand times smaller than a microgram. Your ferritin level will be the same whether it is expressed as mcg/L or ng/mL.If your serum ferritin level is less than 10 to15 mcg/L of blood, you have iron-deficiency anemia.Other tests you might have include:Reticulocyte countReticulocytes are immature red blood cells. A reticulocyte count shows whether the body is making enough new red blood cells. Low reticulocyte levels could be a sign of iron-deficiency anemia.Peripheral smearIn this test, the size and shape of the red blood cells are examined under a microscope. If you have iron-deficiency anemia, the blood cells will look smaller and paler than normal.Serum ironThis test measures the amount of iron in blood. A normal serum iron level is between 40 and 175 mcg/dL. A lower level suggests anemia.Transferrin levelTransferrin carries iron in blood. The transferrin level, also known as the total iron-binding capacity (TIBC), measures how much transferrin in your blood isn't carrying iron. A normal TIBC is between 216 and 400 mcg/dL of blood. A higher level is a sign of anemia.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

Pregnancy after preeclampsia,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pregnancy-after-preeclampsia_10415695.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI've had preeclampsia before. Will I get it again?It's possible. Once you've had preeclampsia, you're at risk of developing it again in a subsequent pregnancy. It all depends on how early you developed the condition and how severe it was. If you had preeclampsia at the very end of your previous pregnancy, the chance of it happening again is fairly low  about 13 percent. But if you developed severe preeclampsia before 29 weeks of pregnancy, your chance of getting it again may be 40 percent or even higher.Having preeclampsia previously in more than one pregnancy also increases your risk. For example, if you had preeclampsia in two previous pregnancies, your risk of getting it in a third is about 30 percent.Is preeclampsia preventable?There's no definitive way to predict if you'll get preeclampsia again, and no one knows for sure whether the condition is preventable. But you can take steps to reduce your risk.Before pregnancySee your healthcare provider before you start trying to get pregnant again. Your provider can review your medical history to determine how likely you are to get preeclampsia again and advise you about ways to reduce your risk.Some health conditions are known to increase the likelihood of developing preeclampsia. For example, high blood pressure (chronic hypertension) and diabetes are both associated with a higher risk, and your provider may recommend making some lifestyle changes or taking medication.If you're already being treated for high blood pressure, your provider can review your medications to make sure they're safe to take during pregnancy. Some drugs, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), are linked to birth defects in the second and third trimesters, so they aren't recommended once you're pregnant.If you're overweight, your provider may suggest losing weight before you get pregnant. Ask for a referral to a dietitian to help you achieve a healthy weight. Eating well and maintaining a healthy weight are some of the best ways to help you have a problem-free pregnancy.During pregnancyIf you haven't already, see your provider early in your pregnancy. If you're at high risk for preeclampsia, it's likely that you'll have extra appointments, and it's important to attend all of them.Your provider will check your blood pressure at each appointment and may test your urine for protein. Although this won't prevent preeclampsia, careful monitoring means you'll start treatment as soon as possible if it looks like the condition is recurring.Talk to your provider about taking low-dose aspirin. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that women at high risk for preeclampsia take low-dose aspirin starting at the end of the first trimester.Aspirin treatment may be a good option if you ever had preeclampsia or another medical complication, but your provider is especially likely to recommend it if you had preeclampsia in more than one pregnancy, or if your baby was born before 34 weeks due to preeclampsia. (Only take aspirin during pregnancyif your provider recommends it.)If you research ways to prevent preeclampsia, you may come up with a list of suggested supplements. Most studies haven't shown that dietary supplements reduce the risk of preeclampsia. Check with your provider before taking any supplements in pregnancy because some may be harmful.How is health care different with preeclampsia?Most of your prenatal care will be similar to any other pregnancy. But you may need more appointments, especially if you developed preeclampsia very early in a previous pregnancy, or if you have other complications.You'll have a routine ultrasound in the first trimester to see how far along you are. This is important to know because if you develop preeclampsia again, you may need to give birth early.Knowing exactly how old your baby is useful information if your provider needs to decide when you should deliver. If you develop preeclampsia, your provider must balance your need to protect your health by giving birth with your baby's need to develop fully before birth.At your prenatal visits, your provider will take your blood pressure and test your urine for protein to check for signs of preeclampsia. Your provider will also ask you about any new symptoms. Preeclampsia symptoms can be different in each pregnancy  a persistent headache instead of swelling, for example  so be sure to let her know if you have any of the following:Swelling in your face or handsA headache that doesn't go awayVision changes, like blurriness or spots in front of your eyesPain in your shoulder or stomachNausea or vomiting (in the second half of pregnancy)Sudden weight gainDifficulty breathingYour provider will also monitor your baby's growth by measuring your bump (fundal height) and doing ultrasounds as needed. Signs that your baby isn't growing well could indicate that there's a problem.Your provider may ask you to help monitor your condition by keeping track of your blood pressure at home and counting the number of times your baby moves in a specific period of time (kick count).You may need to be admitted to the hospital for observation if you begin to develop signs of preeclampsia. If you're at least 37 weeks pregnant, it's likely that you'll have your labor induced. But if it's earlier in your pregnancy, your care will depend on how severe your preeclampsia is, how far along you are, and how your baby is doing.If your condition is stable and your baby is well, you may continue with your pregnancy, but under the close supervision of your healthcare provider. However, if your preeclampsia is getting worse, or if tests suggest that your baby is not doing well, you may have an induction or a c-section.How can I manage my fear about getting preeclampsia again?Preeclampsia is scary, so it's not surprising that you're anxious about getting it again. But keep in mind there's a good chance you won't get preeclampsia the next time you get pregnant, even if you're at high risk.Talk to your provider about preeclampsia, and ask any lingering questions about how preeclampsia affected your previous pregnancy. Understanding your condition and how it was treated may help you to come to terms with it.You can't control whether you develop preeclampsia in your next pregnancy. But focusing on managing the risk factors you can control and following your healthcare provider's recommendations for reducing your risk can put many of your fears to rest.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

How to care for your baby's gums and emerging teeth,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-care-for-your-babys-gums-and-emerging-teeth_126.bc,"Do I need to clean my baby's gums before his teeth come in?Yes. Even before your baby sports his first tooth, it's a good idea to get into the habit of wiping his gums with gauze or a soft wet washcloth during bath time. You don't need to use any toothpaste yet. Simply wrap the cloth or gauze around your index finger and rub it gently over his gums.Bacteria in the mouth usually can't harm the gums before the teeth emerge, but it can be hard to tell when the teeth are starting to push through, so you'll want to start early. Getting your baby used to having his mouth cleaned as part of his daily routine should make it easier to transition into toothbrushing later on, too.What's the best way to brush my baby's teeth after they start coming in?As your child's teeth start to appear (generally around 6 months), you'll need to start brushing them. (If your child is healthy and still hasn't gotten her first tooth by the end of her first year, don't worry  some children don't start getting teeth until 15 to 18 months.)Brush twice a day. Brush in the morning and right before bedtime. Use a baby toothbrush with a small head and grip suitable for your hand.Use a tiny amount of fluoride toothpaste. To avoid giving your child too much fluoride, use a thin smear of toothpaste or a dot the size of a grain of rice. (It's fine to use any fluoridated toothpaste. Note that many toothpastes marketed for babies don't contain fluoride.)Brush gently on the inside and outside of each of your baby's teeth, as well as her tongue (if she'll let you), to dislodge bacteria that can cause bad breath. Since you're using such a small amount of toothpaste, there's no need to rinse.Replace the toothbrush as soon as the bristles start to look worn or splayed.For now, your baby's teeth are probably far enough apart that you don't have to worry about flossing. In fact, there's no evidence that flossing baby teeth makes a difference. Most dentists recommend starting to floss when tooth surfaces touch and you can't clean them with a toothbrush.How can I tell if my baby is getting the right amount of fluoride?Your baby's developing teeth can benefit from a little fluoride. (The amount recommended for children under 3 is .25 milligrams per day.) This mineral helps prevent tooth decay by strengthening tooth enamel and making it more resistant to acids and harmful bacteria.Your baby can get fluoride from toothpaste, water, supplements (if necessary), and a fluoride varnish that his primary healthcare provider or dentist can apply to his teeth.Note: In general, it's not a good idea to give your baby water until he's about 6 months old. Until then, he'll get all the hydration he needs from breast milk or formula, even in hot weather. Read more about giving water to your baby.If the water you use to make your baby's formula contains fluoride, he'll get fluoride from his bottle feedings. Most municipal water supplies are fortified with adequate fluoride. (Call your local water authority to find out about yours). Read more about what kind of water to use to prepare baby formula.If your municipal water supply isn't fluoridated or you get your water from a well, you might consider buying a test kit from your local health department, a hardware store, or a pharmacy.If the fluoride content is less than .3 parts per million, ask your child's doctor or dentist whether you should give your child a fluoride supplement. The doctor can prescribe fluoride in the form of drops that you can add to your baby's bottle or cereal once a day. Experts don't recommend fluoride supplements for babies under 6 months old.Bottled water and fruit juices may contain fluoride, although the amount isn't always listed on the label.Keep in mind that while a little fluoride is a good thing for your baby's teeth, too much of it can lead to a condition called fluorosis, which causes white spots to show up on your child's adult teeth. This is why it's important to use only the tiniest amount of toothpaste until your child is old enough to rinse and spit it out.When should I start taking my baby to the dentist?The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommend that you take your child to the dentist within six months after her first tooth erupts, or by her first birthday, whichever comes first.In the meantime, at everywell-baby visit, your baby's primary healthcare provider should take a look at your baby's teeth (if she has any) and apply fluoride varnish every three to six months, depending on your baby's risk of cavities. Risk factors include a family history of cavities and poor dental health in the mother during pregnancy.When you do take your child to the dentist, be sure to communicate what fluoride treatments your baby has already received at the doctor's office.If you can't afford dental care for your baby, consider getting in touch with your local health department to ask about resources.Do certain foods cause tooth decay in babies?Certain foods can contribute to cavities. Sweet foods like these are a common culprit:fruitdried fruitjuicepeanut butter and jellyStarches can also contribute to cavities:breadscrackerspastapretzelsServe these foods at mealtime rather than as snacks so they're more likely to get dislodged and won't sit on the teeth too long. Serving them with water is also helpful.Don't put your baby to bed with a bottle of milk, formula, juice, or sweetened liquid. These liquids feed bacteria in the mouth that cause tooth decay.Learn more:Video: How to care for your baby's teeth and gumsQuiz: Test your tooth care smartsSlideshow: Your baby's teeth, in order of appearanceAll about teething and tooth careShow sources Hide sources AAPD.

Fortified breads and cereals can also be good sources. (Check the labels.)Here are some other good food sources of vitamin B6:one medium russet baked potato (with skin): 0.70 mg3 ounces light turkey meat, cooked: 0.69 mgone medium avocado: 0.52 mg3 ounces light chicken meat, cooked (without skin): 0.51 mg1 cup fortified breakfast cereal: 0.5 to 2.5 mg3 ounces wild salmon, cooked: 0.48 to 0.8 mg1 cup spinach, cooked: 0.44 mgone medium banana: 0.43 mg1 cup dried plums, pitted: 0.36 mg1 ounce hazelnuts, dry roasted: 0.18 mg6 ounces vegetable juice cocktail: 0.13 mg(Note that a 3-ounce serving of meat or fish is about the size of a deck of cards.)Should you take a vitamin B6 supplement?You should be able to get all you need from a varied diet. Mostprenatal vitaminsalso contain at least 100 percent of the recommended amount.If you're suffering frommorning sickness, check with your healthcare provider before taking additionalB6 supplements. She can tell you how much to take. (Don't take more than your provider recommends. Too much may not be safe for you or your developing baby.)Some high-potency multivitamins contain vitamin B6 in large amounts. But even without taking a supplement you can get too much B6 in your diet if you eat a lot of fortified foods. Read the labels of energy drinks and bars, for example  they sometimes have several times the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for B6. Excessive amounts of vitamin B6 can cause numbness and nerve damage.The signs of a vitamin B6 deficiencyInflammation of the tongue, sores or mouth ulcers, depression, and anemia may signal a deficiency. Mild deficiencies are not uncommon, but severe deficiencies are rare.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014.

Zinc in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_zinc-in-your-pregnancy-diet_673.bc,"Why you need zinc during pregnancyYour baby needs zinc for cell growth and for the production and functioning of DNA  the body's genetic blueprint.Getting enough zinc is especially important during pregnancy because there's so much rapid cell growth. This essential mineral also helps support your immune system, maintain your senses of taste and smell, and heal wounds.Some studies link zinc deficiency to low birth weight and other problems during pregnancy, labor, and delivery.How much zinc you needPregnant women age 18 and younger: 12 milligrams (mg) per dayPregnant women age 19 and older: 11 mg per dayBreastfeeding age 18 and younger: 13 mg per dayBreastfeeding women age 19 and older: 12 mg per dayNonpregnant women ages 19 and older: 8 mg per dayYou don't have to get the recommended amount of zinc every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Food sources of zincFortified cereals and red meat are good sources of this nutrient. You can also get it from some shellfish, poultry, beans, nuts, whole grains, and dairy products.Here are some other good food sources of zinc for pregnant women:3 ounces Dungeness crab, cooked: 4.7 mg3 ounces beef, cooked: 3.7 to 5.8 mg3 ounces dark turkey meat, cooked: 3.0 mg3 ounces pork, cooked: 1.9 to 3.5 mg8 ounces nonfat yogurt with fruit: 1.8 mg1 ounce cashews: 1.6 mg8 ounces milk: 1.0 mg1/2 cup baked beans: 0.9 to 2.9 mg1 ounce almonds: 0.9 mg1 ounce peanuts: 0.9 mg1 ounce cheddar cheese: 0.9 mg(Note that 3 ounces of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.)Oysters are actually the richest food source of zinc  just two can provide more than the recommended amount for the whole day  but experts caution against eatingraw oystersduring pregnancy because of the risk of food-borne illness. What's more, oysters harvested from some areas contain high levels ofmercury.Should you take a zinc supplement?If you're not already getting enough from your diet, yourprenatal vitaminsupplement will most likely provide all the zinc you need.Most people who eat meat and have a reasonably well-balanced diet get plenty of zinc. But if you eat a mostly vegetarian diet, you may have a hard time getting enough zinc from food alone because it's harder to absorb the mineral from plant foods  you may want to ask your healthcare provider if you need a zinc supplement.Can you get too much zinc?Yes. Too much zinc can cause nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. In fact, the National Academy of Sciences, the group that sets the recommended daily amounts for the government, suggests that adults should get no more than 40 mg of zinc a day from all sources. (Women 18 and younger should get no more than 34 mg.)The signs of a zinc deficiencyDeficiencies in the United States are rare, but it can cause impaired sense of smell or taste, a loss of appetite, failure to grow (for children), and a lower immunity to infections.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014.

Copper in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_copper-in-your-pregnancy-diet_677.bc,"Why you need copper during pregnancyCopper, a trace mineral found in all plant and animal tissues, is essential for forming red blood cells. This is especially important during pregnancy, when your blood supply doubles.Copper helps form your baby's heart, blood vessels, and skeletal and nervous systems.Copper also boosts your body's ability to mend tissues and break down sugars. And it keeps your hair growing and looking healthy.How much copper you needPregnant women: 1 milligram (mg) per dayBreastfeeding women: 1.3 mg per dayNonpregnant women ages 19 to 50: .9 mg per dayYou don't have to get the recommended amount of copper every day.

Cooking in these pots may raise your copper intake to toxic levels. (Pots with copper only on the outside or with a copper core bonded to other types of metal  such as stainless steel  are safe to use.)Should you take a supplement?No. If you eat ahealthy, varied diet, you'll probably get enough copper. It's present in seafood, nuts, seeds, wheat bran cereals, whole grain products, greens, and even cocoa products.If your diet doesn't include these foods, a good prenatal multivitamin usually includes an adequate amount. It is possible to get too much copper in your diet, so talk with your healthcare provider before taking any additional supplements.Copper deficiencies are uncommon. Women sometimes come up short in their childbearing years, but you may not notice any signs. If you're concerned that you're not getting enough copper, talk with your healthcare provider before supplementing.Show sources Hide sources IOM. 2010.

Constipation during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_constipation-during-pregnancy_836.bc,"Why am I so constipated?Constipation is a common problem during pregnancy. As many as half of pregnant women get constipated at some point.One culprit is an increase in the hormone progesterone, which relaxes smooth muscles throughout the body, including the digestive tract. This means that food passes through the intestines more slowly. And the problem may be compounded later in pregnancy by the pressure of your growing uterus on your rectum. Iron supplements, particularly in high doses, can make constipation worse.What can I do about constipation?Here are some tips for preventing and easing constipation:Eat high-fiber foods such as whole-grain cereals and breads, brown rice, beans, and fresh fruits and vegetables every day. Adding a couple of tablespoons of unprocessed wheat bran (available at health food stores) to your cereal in the morning and following it with a glass of water can help, though it may take a few days before you notice a difference.Drink plenty of water. Try to have 10 8-ounce cups of water or other beverages each day. (Or, sip throughout the day until your urine is clear or pale yellow in color  a sign of proper hydration.) A glass of fruit juice every day, especially prune juice, can also be helpful. Some people find that drinking a warm liquid right after waking up helps get things moving.Pregnancy constipation Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:03Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:03Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosExercise regularly. Walking, swimming, riding a stationary bike, and yoga can all help ease constipation and leave you feeling more fit and healthy.Your bowels are most likely to be active after meals, so make time to use the bathroom after you eat. Listen to your body. Never put off going to the bathroom when you feel the urge.If your prenatal multivitamin contains a large dose of iron (and you're not anemic), ask your healthcare provider about switching to a supplement with less iron.If the measures above don't help (or you can't follow them), talk to your caregiver about taking an over-the-counter fiber supplement or stool softener.Is constipation ever serious?Not usually, but occasionally it can be a symptom of another problem. If you have severe constipation that is accompanied by abdominal pain, alternates with diarrhea, or you pass mucus or blood, call your doctor or midwife immediately.Also, straining during a bowel movement or passing a hard stool can lead to or worsen hemorrhoids, which are swollen veins in the rectal area. Hemorrhoids can be extremely uncomfortable, though they rarely cause serious problems. In most cases, they go away fairly soon after your baby is born. However, if the pain is severe or you have rectal bleeding, call your caregiver so you can be evaluated.

(Goodbye birth control, hello hemorrhoid cream.) Find out all about the products you might need, and which are safe, during pregnancy. Take a printable version with you.Heavy-duty moisturizerSoothe the itch of stretching skin with a rich oil or lotion. If your skin  or sense of smell  is extra sensitive these days, go for a scent-free product. For an even bigger aaaah factor, chill the moisturizer in the fridge.Soft toothbrush and good flossSoaring progesterone levels make your gums more sensitive and prone to pregnancy gingivitis. Unchecked gingivitis can turn into periodontitis, a much more serious gum disease, so you'll want to give your gums thorough but tender care, with an extra-soft toothbrush.Daily flossing is your second weapon against pregnancy gingivitis. If flossing your back teeth triggers a hypersensitive gag reflex, try an interdental flosser  these small gadgets help you get between teeth without putting your fingers in the back of your mouth.Panty liners and breast padsNot all women need them, but panty liners discreetly handle all sorts of pregnancy drips, from heavier vaginal discharge to possible urine leakage when you laugh, cough, or sneeze.Same goes for breast pads: Some expecting moms start leaking colostrum, the antibody-rich first milk, in the last few months of pregnancy. If this happens to you, breast pads can protect your clothes and prevent any awkward wet spots.Morning sickness soothersOne woman's go-to remedy may do nothing to quell your queasiness, so if you're suffering from morning sickness you'll probably need to experiment to find something that works for you. Popular ones to try: ginger candies or tea, pregnancy lollipops and suckers, vitamin B6, and acupressure bands.VitaminsPrenatal vitamins. These contain folic acid and iron, two nutrients that are important for pregnancy but hard to get enough of through diet alone. They've got the right amount of other vitamins and minerals for pregnancy as well.Omega-3 vitamins. The omega-3 fatty acid called DHA is important for your baby's brain, nerve, and eye development  and it's not in your regular prenatal vitamin. Experts recommend getting between 200 and 300 milligrams of DHA daily during pregnancy. You'd have to eat a good amount of cold water fish and other DHA-rich foods to get that amount through diet, so check with your doctor about taking a supplement.A calcium supplement. If you're not getting 1,000 milligrams a day  equivalent to three to four 8-ounce servings of yogurt or milk  you may want to check with your doctor about taking a calcium supplement in your second trimester, when calcium begins building up your baby's bones. Otherwise, you won't replace what your baby takes from you, increasing your risk for osteoporosis later in life. Look for a product labeled lead-free that contains calcium carbonate, the form your body most easily absorbs.AntacidMany women first experience the fiery discomfort of heartburn in the second half of pregnancy. There's no cure other than delivery, but some over-the-counter meds are safe, providing you get your caregiver's okay first.Constipation remedyCombine slower digestion with a growing uterus that crowds your digestive tract, and you may wind up with epic constipation. If more water, exercise, and fiber-rich foods don't do the trick, fiber supplements are safe to use when you're pregnant  every day, if needed  and may help prevent hemorrhoids. Stool softeners are generally considered okay to use, but check in with your doctor before you start taking any.Find out which fiber products and stool softeners are safe during pregnancy. Tips for constipation during pregnancyWhat causes constipation, and how can you prevent it?Gas remedyThe same culprit behind your constipation  higher progesterone levels  can be blamed for making you more bloated and gassy than you've ever been in your life. An over-the-counter medication with simethicone will help you feel fit to be in public again; just make sure to get your caregiver's okay first.Hemorrhoid reliefConstipation and pressure from your growing uterus make you more prone to hemorrhoids. Medicated wipes are safe for pregnancy, as are some creams and suppositories. Some women find witch hazel pads also spell hemorrhoid relief, and they may do double-duty in fighting pregnancy acne.Find out which hemorrhoid-relief products are safe during pregnancy.Yeast infection treatmentYeast infections can be another not-so-fun side effect of pregnancy, but luckily, there are many pregnancy-safe creams or suppositories to help you fight the dreaded itch. Just make sure to check in with your caregiver first, to find out whether a yeast infection's really what's causing your symptoms.Sleep aidThere's plenty to keep you up at night these days  discomfort, frequent bathroom trips, heartburn, and middle-of-the-night anxiety attacks about finances, for starters. No wonder more than three-quarters of pregnant women experience insomnia. When you need some rest, there are a few sleep aids that are generally considered safe for occasional use. As with any medication, though, check with your caregiver first.Pain reliever and fever reducerMany of these medications, like aspirin or ibuprofen, are off-limits during pregnancy, but acetaminophen is a safe way to treat pain, headache, and fever. Just make sure you follow the dosage instructions on the label.Find out which pain relievers and fever reducers are safe during pregnancy.Allergy remedyPregnancy can worsen allergies, or even make you allergic to substances that never bothered you before. Doctors prefer you to avoid medications during the first trimester as much as possible, but later on you can consult your caregiver about a safe allergy treatment. (Note: Many women get a stuffy nose during pregnancy without having a cold or allergies. If you don't have any symptoms besides congestion, you may have ""rhinitis of pregnancy."")Cold medicationGetting sick while pregnant is extra miserable. Some cold drugs are safe for pregnancy and some aren't. Because most cold medications contain several drugs to treat different symptoms, you'll need to read labels carefully. See the full list of what's okay and what to avoid.Nose care productsSaline spray or drops can help you clear out your schnoz and breathe a little easier whether you have a cold, allergies, or just a stuffy nose. And unlike a decongestant spray, you don't need to get your doctor's okay to use it.Petroleum jelly or a water-based nasal lubricant (available over the counter from pharmacies) can help avoid another common side effect of pregnancy: nosebleeds. They're more likely to occur if the membranes inside your nose get dry, so in parched environments  cold weather, airplanes, high altitudes, and the like  dab a little lubricant in your nose.EyedropsPregnancy hormones can make your eyes feel more dry and irritated. Some over-the-counter dry-eye drops are fine, while others contain ingredients that aren't proven safe for pregnancy, so ask your doctor for a recommendation.Heating padHeat isn't a proven therapy for pregnancy aches such as low back pain, but some women find it helps. Heating pads, hot water bottles, and microwavable heating packs are all safe options.Acne fighterHormonal changes give some lucky women a clear ""pregnancy glow"" but leave many others with more pimples than they've seen since puberty. Over-the-counter products containing alpha-hydroxy acids or glycolic acid are safe for pregnancy and may help control breakouts. If not, visit a dermatologist for stronger (but still baby-safe) options. Learn more about pregnancy-safe skin care.If you're suffering from acne, foundation or concealer can even out your skin tone. It's also a great remedy for other pregnancy skin woes such as dark splotches, rashes, or broken capillaries. Many stores offer free samples, so feel free to try before you buy.SunscreenIt's always recommended, but using sunscreen during pregnancy can prevent or minimize blotchy areas of skin darkening, known as the ""mask of pregnancy."" Look for a broad-spectrum sunscreen that blocks both UVA and UVB rays with an SPF of 30 or higher. Then wear it every day  clouds or shine.Hair removal productThe good news: Higher estrogen levels slow down the natural shedding of hairs, giving you a thicker head of hair. The bad news: You may notice more hair sprouting on your face or body, too. Waxing, tweezing, and shaving are all safe, but experts recommend staying away from bleaches and depilatories for now, since you may absorb the chemicals through your skin.A word of warning: Some women find waxing more painful while pregnant, so you may want to avoid more sensitive areas and try a test patch first.Hair accessoriesIf you've suddenly got more hair than you know what to do with, and not much time or energy to style it, hair clips, bands, combs, and pins can come in handy. Once you get the hang of it, a casually elegant updo (think French twist, messy bun) only takes a minute."

Your NICU's social worker can help you find the right program for you and help you apply (as early as possible).SSI (Supplemental Security Income)Social Security provides SSI disability benefits to certain infants of low birth weight, whether or not they were born prematurely. A child weighing less than 1,200 grams (about 2 pounds, 10 ounces) at birth or a child weighing between 1,200 and 2,000 grams (about 4 pounds, 6 ounces) at birth and considered small for his gestational age will generally qualify. Qualifying for this federal program also depends on your income and resources.To get benefits, you'll have to have an interview at your local Social Security Administration office. Your NICU social worker can help you navigate this process and tell you what to bring with you to the interview. Before you begin, read the Child Disability Starter Kit on the SSA website. This SSA page will help you find other assistance.If you qualify for SSI, you may also be able to get help from your state or county. For example, in most states, people who get SSI automatically qualify for Medicaid (see below).MedicaidThis joint federal and state program administered by your state can help with health care costs, even if you have health insurance. If you are enrolled in Medicaid and have private insurance, for instance, Medicaid may cover services that your private plan does not.Your eligibility for Medicaid will depend on family income, family size, and other factors (such as citizenship or immigration status). If you were receiving Medicaid when your baby was born, your baby will automatically be eligible for Medicaid, too. As the parent of a baby who's receiving Medicaid, you will be eligible for 60 days after the birth (or longer, if you continue to qualify).Visit the Medicaid website to find out whether you or your child qualify for Medicaid as well as other programs offered by your state.Another program your child may qualify for is the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP provides health coverage to children in families who can't afford private health insurance but who have incomes too high to qualify for Medicaid.For more information about Medicaid and CHIP, visit InsureKidsNow.gov.WICWIC, the special supplemental nutrition program for women, infants, and children, is federally funded and run by the states. It provides food, healthcare referrals, nutrition education, and breastfeeding support to low-income pregnant, breastfeeding, and postpartum women and to infants and children up to age 5.To qualify, you or your child needs to meet financial eligibility requirements and be deemed at nutritional risk. To find out more about how to apply, check out the WIC prescreening tool or contact your state agency. The toll-free numbers and website links for WIC state agencies are listed on the WIC website.Ronald McDonald HousesThe Ronald McDonald Houses act as a home away from home for families so they can stay together near their hospitalized child. Families either stay at no cost or are asked to make a donation of up to $25 per day, depending on the location. (The actual cost to operate the rooms is between $50 and $100 per night.)Some NICUs also have Ronald McDonald Family Rooms for families to rest and regroup. In some Family Rooms, you can sign up to take a nap, have a shower, or drink a fresh cup of coffee while you're only a few steps away from your baby.Hospital-grade breast pumpsYou'll likely need a good pump to get  and keep  a steady milk supply for your baby. If you participate in the WIC program or Medicaid, your state agency may cover the purchase or rental of a pump. (Hospitals sometimes rent high-quality pumps.) Your private insurance may also cover the cost of a pump.Be sure to investigate your options as early as possible. There may be a time limit on requests for breast pump coverage (say, within so many weeks of your baby's birth), and you may need a prescription from your doctor in order to be eligible.Tax-deductible expensesSave all your receipts for out-of-pocket medical expenses during your child's hospital stay. You may be able to deduct them on your taxes.Free parkingNICU social workers may be able to distribute free or discounted parking passes to parents who are spending a lot of time at the NICU, which can be a big help at hospitals with scarce or expensive parking. Be sure to ask your social worker whether there's any free or discounted parking at your hospital.Show sources Hide sources HHS. 2012. Medicaid coverage of lactation services.

Tooth care for children,https://www.babycenter.com/0_tooth-care-for-children_11282.bc,"What's the best way to brush my child's teeth?Use a small, soft toothbrush and a tiny amount of fluoride toothpaste. (It's fine to use any fluoridated toothpaste. Note that many toothpastes marketed for babies and toddlers don't contain fluoride.)As soon as your child's teeth start erupting, use a thin smear of toothpaste or a dot the size of a grain of rice. After her third birthday, you can use a pea-size amount. Be sure to follow these recommendations to avoid giving your child too much fluoride.Twice a day, in the morning and at night after dinner, gently brush the teeth on both the inside and outside surfaces, as well as the tongue, to dislodge bacteria that can cause bad breath. Once you think your child can manage not to swallow the toothpaste, teach her to rinse with water.Replace the toothbrush as soon as the bristles start to look worn or splayed.Your child's dentist may also recommend flossing between any tooth surfaces that are touching. The best time to floss is right after brushing so the floss will draw fluoride from the toothpaste down between the teeth.When can I let my child start brushing his own teeth?As soon as he's willing and able, it's a good idea to let your child try to brush his own teeth, even though he probably won't do a good job until he's about 7 years old or so.In the meantime, brush your teeth while he's doing his, and then ""check"" each other's teeth to see if they're clean. Tell him you'll get the spots he ""missed"" and let him get your ""missed spots,"" too.What can I do if my child won't brush?If your child fusses when it's time to brush, it might help to buy her a toothbrush with a special cartoon character on it.Liz Birka White, a mother of three in Diablo, California, says this worked well for all her children. ""My firstborn really hated brushing until I bought him an Elmo toothbrush. From that day on, he couldn't get enough. It was just the ticket I needed to interest him in brushing.""You can also let your child have several brushes in different colors so that she can choose the one she wants when it's time to brush.For a variety of other solutions, read these suggestions from parents whose children balked at brushing.Does my child need fluoride?Developing teeth can benefit from a little fluoride. This mineral prevents tooth decay by strengthening tooth enamel and making it more resistant to acids and harmful bacteria. Your child can get fluoride from toothpaste, water, and, if needed, supplements. His dentist will also apply a fluoride varnish to his teeth at his dental checkups.Most municipal water supplies are fortified with adequate fluoride. (Call your local water authority to find out about yours.) If your municipal water supply isn't fortified or you get your water from a well, consider buying a test kit from your local health department, a hardware store, or a pharmacy.If the fluoride content is less than .3 parts per million, ask your child's doctor or dentist whether you should give your child a supplement. You can get a prescription for drops or chewable tablets.Bottled water and fruit juices may also contain fluoride, although the amount isn't always listed on the label.Keep in mind that while a little fluoride is a good thing for your child's teeth, swallowing too much of it over time can lead to a condition called fluorosis, which can cause white spots to show up on your child's adult teeth. That's why it's important not to use too much toothpaste, especially before your child learns to rinse and spit it out.Are certain foods more likely to cause tooth decay?Yes. Sweets (including fruit, dried fruit, juice, and foods such as peanut butter and jelly) and starches (such as breads, crackers, pasta, pretzels) can contribute to cavities.Try to serve these foods at mealtime rather than as snacks so they're more likely to get dislodged and won't sit on the teeth too long. Serving them with water is also helpful.When should I start taking my child to the dentist?The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommend that you take your child to the dentist within six months after his first tooth erupts, or by his first birthday, whichever comes first.If you haven't taken your child for a dental checkup, make an appointment as soon as possible. Then follow the dentist's guidelines for follow-up visits based on your child's needs.If you can't afford dental care for your child, consider getting in touch with your local health department to find out about resources.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2014.

Getting the most from HIV medication,https://www.babycenter.com/0_getting-the-most-from-hiv-medication_10415064.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineHow can I stick to my HIV treatment plan?The most important thing to do is probably the simplest: Go to all your medical appointments. That way, your healthcare provider can help you monitor the medications you're taking, watch out for any side effects, and supervise your general condition.A treatment plan for HIV consists of medications that make up antiretroviral therapy (ART). There's a lot you can do to help yourself stay on track:Talk with your provider about your plan, so you can develop the one that works best for you. Ask for a written copy of the plan, and make sure it details each of your medications, including how and when to take them.Find out what side effects to expect and how to deal with them.Understand how the treatment plan protects you and your baby from infection and helps prevent the virus from becoming resistant to other medication. Knowing this may motivate you to stay on the plan.Talk to your provider about any challenges you face that could affect your ability to take HIV medication. Maintaining a treatment plan can be harder if you're also dealing with substance abuse or alcoholism, unstable housing, mental illness, relationship problems, or other issues.Use a seven-day pillbox to organize pills for each day. Fill it at the start of every week.Tell your provider about your daily schedule so you can plan your medication to fit in with your life, rather than organizing your life around medication.Take your pills at the same time as something else that you do regularly each day  watching the news, brushing your teeth, or arriving home from work.Use your phone to set reminders, either with the alarm or by using an app. The AIDSinfo HIV/AIDS Drug Database App bookmarks HIV medicines, allows you to add your own notes about a drug, and has a daily pill reminder feature.Ask your family members, friends, or co-workers to remind you to take your medicines.Always have access to your medication and keep a spare supply at work. If you're traveling, pack enough to last for the whole trip.Join a support group, either online or in your community. Getting advice and encouragement from others going through the same thing helps.How can I get the most out of HIV medication?Take HIV medication exactly as your healthcare provider tells you. That means taking it:at the right timewith food, or before or after meals, depending on the advice you've been givenevery day, including weekends, holidays, and even when you're in laborTaking medication consistently can be difficult. It helps to keep track of what you take and when on a computer, phone, or in a notebook. The important information to track includes:the name of each medicinethe dosethe number of pills to takewhen to take the medicationWith ART, you'll likely take several pills a day, each with its own requirements.Missing a dose, or taking it at the wrong time, can result in an increase in the amount of HIV in your body, putting your health at risk and increasing the chance of passing the virus on to your baby.Drug resistance is also a problem with regularly missed doses. Drug resistance means certain drugs no longer work to reduce HIV in the blood.What should I do if I forget to take my HIV medication?Don't panic. Call your healthcare provider. In most cases, your provider will say to take the medicine if you just missed it.Discuss medication at each appointment with your provider. Tell your provider if you're having difficulty following your medication regimen.Don't forget to mention any side effects you're having. Side effects from HIV medicines are a major reason why sticking to a treatment plan can be difficult.Let your provider know if your treatment plan is too complicated to follow. Your provider may simplify your regimen to include fewer HIV medicines or to reduce the number of times a day you need to take them.What else does my healthcare provider need to know?Tell your provider about any other medications you take. This includes other prescription and nonprescription medicines, vitamins, nutritional supplements, and herbal products. Other medicines or supplements may interact with HIV medication. A drug interaction can reduce or increase the effect of HIV medicine or cause side effects.Tell your health care provider about anything that makes it difficult to stick to your treatment plan. For example, lack of health insurance and alcohol or drug abuse can make it hard to follow HIV treatment. If needed, your healthcare provider can recommend resources to help you address any issues you have before you start treatment.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2012.

Coping with restless legs syndrome: Pregnancy advice from moms-to-be,https://www.babycenter.com/0_coping-with-restless-legs-syndrome-pregnancy-advice-from-mom_10334344.bc,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) can make you downright miserable. As one BabyCenter mom put it, ""Life with a newborn affords you much more sleep than pregnancy with RLS. At least you know that when you lie down, you'll actually go to sleep!""If you have RLS, you probably feel an uncontrollable urge to move your legs to relieve sensations of crawling, tingling, or burning in your legs  and possibly in your arms and other parts of your body. The symptoms can be at their worst when you lie down to go to sleep. For more details, see our complete article on restless legs syndrome.Many BabyCenter moms-to-be have been in that same boat. Here, they offer their best tips for getting relief from the discomfort of this maddening syndrome so you can sleep better.Exercise & muscle workRegular exercise helps me. I got RLS even before I was pregnant. For me it usually means I have too much pent-up energy and I need to get outside and go on a run or a walk.The only thing that's been working for me is getting out of bed and either walking around for a bit or just doing squats right by the bed.One thing that helps is strengthening exercises or ""tensing up"" the area of muscles that suffer from the problem. For example, my RLS is in my hips. If I'm in bed and feel the RLS coming on, I contract & hold that muscle group for about ten seconds, then relax, and then repeat four or five times. Don't forget to breathe while you're doing it.Stretching and yogaThe only thing I've found that helps is to do some yoga at night. It's the stretching that really helps. I don't need to do the whole half-hour video. Just ten to 20 minutes and it drastically reduces my RLS. Otherwise I lie in bed all night shaking my leg trying to fall asleep.The only relief is if I get up and do some yoga stretches, stretching my entire leg from hip to toe.I'm 32 weeks pregnant and get RLS symptoms about every other night. It's very annoying, and my legs can tingle and then twitch on their own. If I get up out of bed and do some deep leg stretches using the major muscle groups (thighs, calves, etc.) for about five or so minutes, I can alleviate the issue long enough to get to sleep. Yoga positions seem to help.The only thing that helps me sleep is stretching my legs really well before bed. If I don't spend five to ten minutes stretching them out, I can't get to sleep at all.Relaxation techniquesEditor's note: For more ideas, see our article on relaxation techniques for better pregnancy sleep.Once I do fall asleep, it doesn't come back. So I try my hardest to get into the mind-set of not thinking about it. I try thinking of something peaceful, and before I know it I fall asleep. I also noticed the later I go to sleep, the worse it is.I've dealt with RLS all of my life, but it gets worse during pregnancy. I found a relaxation technique and it's a miracle worker! I swear by this:Step 1: Starting with your toes, flex them as hard as you can while you breathe in. Hold for five to ten seconds, then relax as you exhale. Move through every section of your body (careful not to forget anything), all the way up to your face.Step 2: After your flex routine, close your eyes and count down from ten. Tell yourself (your partner can help) that with every number you'll feel yourself sink deeper into the bed and your body will feel more and more relaxed. Repeat as many times as needed. With practice you'll fall asleep on the first try. MassageI had RLS with my last pregnancy, and massages helped me. Mainly my feet and legs but also hips. I went every other week from the time I was I was 6 months pregnant and that was great. I couldn't have done without it.Massage, massage, massage! That is the only thing that helps me. My hubby even sits up in the middle of the night when he notices me twitching and kicking and rubs my legs until either he falls asleep or they stop moving. What a guy!I have found that massage helps. I was a massage therapist and had pregnant clients that would come in once or twice a month and claimed that it was really effective. I have received massages since I started getting RLS with my pregnancy, and it has helped. Pregnancy massage for relaxationWatch a demonstration of how to do a relaxation massage at home during pregnancy.HeatThe one and only thing that seems to help me is taking a hot bath while rubbing my legs.I am 34 weeks along and find that heat helps my restless legs. I put a heated microwavable pillow just above my knees (doesn't fix, but helps) when I'm trying to get to sleep.I've tried everything, and the only thing that even remotely helps is hot showers (baths if you have them, we don't). My skin is getting dried out (so I'm relying on lotion more and more these days), but a long, hot shower right before I head to bed often helps calm my legs enough to get me to sleep.I got RLS very badly with my first pregnancy. What helped me get to sleep more than anything else was a plug-in heating pad. Plug it in, set it between your calves or ankles, and turn up the heat so that it is almost too hot to handle. The burning feeling distracts from the RLS and you will eventually doze off to sleep. That is the only thing that consistently worked for me besides foot massagesI am 33 weeks pregnant. I soak in the tub every night then jump into bed. This is the only relief I have found!It helps to take a warm bath before bed. While you are floating, your legs are moving but you can still relax. If I wake up in the middle of the night and can't get back to sleep, I put a heating pad behind my knees. I use the kind that you heat in the microwave.ColdWhen I'm having an ""episode,"" I soak my feet in the bathtub with the coldest water possible. This seems to be very effective!What really helps is to cool my feet down. Yes, that's what I said. I put an ice pack against the bottom of my feet for a few minutes, and it seems to relieve my symptoms enough to where I can fall asleep.I am 28 weeks pregnant in my second pregnancy, and RLS has been a problem for me, as it was in my first pregnancy. It left me very sleep deprived before the birth of my first  not how you want to be when you bring home a new baby. This time around I have a remedy that is working for me very well. If I settle into bed and it starts (usually with a sudden rush of heat to my feet), I put my feet in very cold water for a couple of minutes. Then I put a bit of Bengay on my legs. It is the menthol-only kind that makes your skin feel cool instead of hot. It sounds funny, but it really works for me!A shower before bed with a blast of cold water on my head right at the end is the only thing that works reliably.Old wives' tales?My mom told me about this old wives' tale remedy she uses for her RLS. Two hours before bed, soak your feet in hot water and Epsom salts for a good 30 minutes. Make sure you have a towel handy. As soon as you dry off your feet, put a light coating of Vicks VapoRub all over your feet, in between your toes, on the balls of your feet, and around your ankles, then sit for 15 minutes with your feet up. I swear by this  it works! No more RLS for me.This will sound bizarre, but what do you have to lose? Put a bar of soap under your sheet. Or more than one. I put a few pieces of ""soap scraps"" (the almost used-up bars). I don't know why it works, but it really does make the restless leg stuff go away!Everyone will think I am crazy after they read this, but it worked. Take a bar of soap and put it under the sheet at the foot of the bed where you sleep. It works! My grandmother told me about it.OrgasmI am 8 months and I have RLS, and the only thing that helps me to relax enough to get to sleep is having an orgasm. I've tried a lot of things but for some reason that specific release is enough to calm my body down to fall asleep.Only one thing has worked for me: having sex or a least having an orgasm.BananasBananas are amazing for this! Almost since day one of this pregnancy (I'm now 35 weeks), I've eaten half a banana every morning and another half a banana before I go upstairs to get ready for bed. It's the only thing that has helped at all.I hate bananas but was getting desperate, so I tried it. I eat a banana every night, and it has been working. Now I can actually fall asleep and have a good night's rest.I was getting desperate. So about three weeks ago, I started eating two bananas every night before I go to bed. It works! I stopped having RLS! Completely. I can't believe I suffered through the previous pregnancies and it could have been avoided by eating bananas.Editor's note: Bananas are an excellent source of potassium, which plays an important role in sending nerve impulses and helping your muscles contract. If you don't like bananas, there are plenty of other great food sources. And they're good for you even if they don't calm your restless legs. See our list of potassium-rich foods.Vitamin supplementsMy doctor put me on calcium and magnesium. It has all but completely taken RLS away. I still get that feeling like it's coming on, but it doesn't actually start and I'm able to fall asleep.Calcium-magnesium supplement helped, but I really got rid of the problem by taking iron supplements. I'm on my second pregnancy now and have been using iron supplements since the beginning. No sign of restless legs (yet!).Editor's note: Consult your doctor before taking any supplements while pregnant.Try, try again!I have tried two things that seem to work. First of all, I use Tiger Balm on my calves before I go to bed. They might burn for a little while, but it seems to relax my legs. I also got an acupuncture treatment, which really did the trick.I found that these things helped, although not reliably: swimming lapseating bananas before bedkeeping the legs elevated higher than the bodyI didn't have this problem with my first two pregnancies, but this time it's terrible. I have it in both my arms and legs, and not just in bed but while I'm driving and sitting. I feel almost crazy at times. What definitely makes it worse: coffee and Benadryl. What is supposed to help but hasn't: lots of calcium. Massage and a bar of soap in my bed by my feet (weird, but I'm desperate) seemed to help briefly. I'm going to try iron next. Something has to work, because I have three months to go."
Alternative therapies for ADHD,https://www.babycenter.com/0_alternative-therapies-for-adhd_67364.bc,"If you're not satisfied with mainstream ADHD treatments such as medication and behavior therapy, you may be tempted to explore alternative or complementary therapies to help your child manage his condition. There's little reliable scientific evidence to show that any of these therapies are helpful for children with ADHD, and most major health organizations, including the American Academy of Pediatrics and Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder (CHADD) do not endorse them. But each of the following therapies has a significant following among some parents and practitioners. If any of these alternative methods appeal to you, talk to your practitioner about how you might incorporate them into your child's treatment program.Art therapySome experts believe that engaging in creative activities such as drawing, listening to music, or dancing helps children with ADHD calm down and focus better. ""Art utilizes the part of the brain that controls emotions,"" says George Lynn, therapist and author of Survival Strategies for Parenting Your ADD Child. ""Children with ADHD often have trouble controlling their emotions and these activities can help calm them."" Several studies suggest that music can help children with ADHD concentrate more easily, but more research needs to be done to confirm this. Still, some therapists and parents of children with ADHD say that these kids often do have an affinity for music and other kinds of artistic expression, and finding a creative outlet that allows your child to excel and express himself can be a great self-esteem booster.BiofeedbackBiofeedback can help teach a child to calm down and focus by training him, through the use of a special machine, to control his body's responses to stress, including pulse rate, breathing rate, and muscle tension. When the child is ""hooked up"" to the machine, it will tell him when his pulse rate is up, for example, indicating that he's upset or excited, and when it's coming back down, indicating that he's succeeding in calming himself. With practice, proponents say, he may learn to calm himself without using the machine. Preliminary research shows that biofeedback may be helpful in reducing the symptoms of ADHD, although much more needs to be conducted to say for sure. Biofeedback takes a number of sessions to show results, the results may not last beyond the sessions, and it may not work well in young children, who tend to have less control over their emotions.AcupunctureAcupuncture, widely used in Chinese medicine and gaining acceptance in Western medicine, involves stimulating certain points on the body with thin needles to improve the way the body functions. In 1993, the National Institutes of Health funded a grant for researchers to examine acupuncture's potential in treating ADHD. The results of the very small controlled clinical trial proved promising: More than half the children showed improvement in their symptoms. Still, more research is needed to determine whether acupuncture will be a safe and effective treatment for ADHD. Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT)This form of psychotherapy attempts to teach a person to think about his motivations before he acts. Many experts contend that, while CBT works well for many adults, there isn't any evidence that it's effective for kids with ADHD. ""With CBT, you're essentially asking a child who can't think before he acts to think before he acts,"" says Andrew Adesman, director of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Schneider Children's Hospital in New Hyde Park, New York. However, a few experts have found CBT to be helpful, especially when it's incorporated into certain discipline techniques. ""Cognitive therapy for kids with impulsive, aggressive, and hyperactive behavior involves getting them to act independently, without reminders or cajoling from you or their teachers,"" says David Stein, psychologist and author of Ritalin Is Not the Answer and Unraveling the ADD / ADHD Fiasco. ""You use consequences to teach children to think, not just to mindlessly obey."" For example, Stein suggests requiring children to tell you why they were given a time-out immediately following the punishment  and if they can't tell you, to enforce another time-out. If you're interested, you can learn these techniques from a CBT therapist who works with children (ask your practitioner for a referral) or by doing your own reading.Parenting strategies for treating symptomsA number of experts don't believe that ADHD should be considered a condition that requires a cure. They contend that parenting strategies alone can turn around symptoms such as hyperactivity, inattention, and impulsivity in any child. Howard Glasser, family therapist and co-author of Transforming the Difficult Child, believes that some children develop ADHD-like symptoms because they find that they get more attention from their parents and teachers when things are going wrong. A parent's typical response to a child when things are going well is relatively low key in comparison to the more animated and emotional responses children receive for misbehavior. ""These children inadvertently discover that they get more of a reaction when they're having a hard time, and that deepens their impression that people are more interested in them in relation to their problems,"" says Glasser. He recommends, among other things, that parents become much more animated in their recognition and appreciation when their children are behaving well and when rules aren't being broken. In his book, Glasser suggests ways parents can encourage their children to use their intensity successfully instead of trying to quell it. ""My feeling is that intensity is a gift, and if you know what to do with it, it can become a source of greatness,"" he says. (Many of these strategies would fit in well with mainstream behavior therapy techniques.) Dietary changesAvoiding food dyes and additives According to a recent report issued by the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a small body of research (including a 1982 study by the National Institutes of Health) suggests that food dyes  and possibly preservatives, as well  can aggravate behavior problems in a small percentage of children with ADHD. You can test this theory in your own child's case by eliminating foods and vitamins containing colorings with names like tartrazine, Red 40, and Yellow 5 from your child's diet for several weeks to see if your child's behavior or mood improves. Many foods that contain these ingredients, such as cookies, candies, children's cereals, brightly-colored beverages, and soft drinks, should probably not make up a large part of your child's diet anyway.Avoiding salicylate and food allergens A few experts advocate eliminating foods that contain the naturally occurring substance salicylate, such as apples, oranges, berries, apricots, and tomatoes. (A regimen called the Feingold Diet, created in the 1970s by Benjamin Feingold, an allergist, advocates eliminating foods that contain salicylate as well as food dyes and additives from the diet of children with ADHD. Studies on the effectiveness of this regimen have had widely varying results.) Several experts also believe that food allergies may aggravate the symptoms of ADHD and recommend eliminating foods they believe may be triggers, such as wheat, corn, chocolate, and eggs, but very little research has been done on this. If you suspect that your child may be allergic or behaviorally sensitive to any of these foods, talk to a nutritionist or allergist before removing them from his diet to ensure that your child is still getting all the nutrients his growing body needs.Limiting sugar While many studies have examined a possible link between sugar and hyperactivity, none has found a significant relationship. Still, some parents swear that their children act out more after eating foods that contain a lot of refined sugar. It may be more likely that sugary foods contain other ingredients (food dyes, for example) that may worsen a child's behavior. In any event, it can't hurt to reduce the amount of sugar in your child's diet. According to the U.S. Department of Agriculture, children consume an average of twice the amount recommended. And while some people worry that using sugar substitutes such as saccharine or aspartame may have ill health effects, there's no evidence that they affect behavior in children with ADHD.Limiting carbohydrates This theory suggests that a diet overly rich in carbohydrates can cause cyclical spikes and drops in blood sugar levels and exacerbate the symptoms of ADHD. ""There's some evidence that kids with ADHD crave carbohydrates, particularly refined or simple carbs such as sugar and fruit, and in a small percentage of cases, eating these foods does seem to make the symptoms worse,"" says Lynn. Proponents of this theory recommend avoiding simple carbohydrates and replacing them with protein- and fiber-rich foods, such as meats and vegetables, but most experts don't subscribe to this strategy as a treatment for ADHD. ""The best advice is to offer your child a balanced diet,"" says Lynn. SupplementsFatty acids Preliminary research shows that supplementing a child's diet with the essential fatty acid omega-3 (commonly called ""fish oil"" because it's found in fish) can help him manage his ADHD symptoms. This strategy is based on the premise that the brain needs certain fatty acids to function properly, and that ADHD symptoms like inattentiveness and impulsivity result from a deficiency of omega-3. In fact, children with ADHD do appear to have naturally lower levels of these lipids than other children do. Researchers are currently conducting studies to test the validity of the theory. Fatty acid supplements are considered fairly safe if you stick to the recommended dose; still you should always talk to your doctor before giving your child supplements of any kind.Megavitamins and nutrients Some proponents claim that giving a child with ADHD large amounts of certain vitamins (such as B6 and B12), minerals (such as zinc), trace elements, and other nutritional elements can alleviate symptoms. Currently, very little reliable research exists to support this theory. Giving your child large doses of certain vitamins and minerals can, in fact, be dangerous. Offering a balanced and nutritious diet is the best way to ensure that he's getting the nutrients he needs. Speak to your child's doctor if you are concerned about his nutrition.Homeopathy Some people claim that homeopathic remedies can significantly improve the symptoms of ADHD. The theory behind homeopathy is that certain potentially toxic substances, when taken in an extremely diluted form, can trigger the body's natural healing process. There are currently no reliable studies showing that homeopathy is effective for treating ADHD.Herbs While you may be tempted to try giving your child herbs, such as valerian and ginkgo, that are thought to calm the nerves and increase the ability to focus, no research currently exists to show that taking herbs can reduce the symptoms of ADHD. And although herbs are ""natural,"" they can be as potent as prescription drugs, especially for children. Since the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulates herbs only minimally, you can never be sure that you're even getting what the label indicates. Always speak with your doctor before giving your child any over-the-counter product, whether natural or synthetic. How to evaluate alternative therapiesWhen you're considering any alternative option for your child, the organization Children and Adults with Attention Deficit Disorder (CHADD) suggests the following guidelines.Ask the provider (if there is one):Have clinical trials been conducted on this approach, and if so, can I see the research?Is there a national organization of practitioners that licenses or accredits those who practice the treatment?Be suspicious if the treatment:claims it will work for everyone with ADHD and will also cure other health problemsuses only case histories or testimonials as proof of effectivenessdoesn't list the contents or include directions for proper usedoesn't contain information warning about side effects (for supplements)is described as harmless because it's ""natural"" (most drugs are developed from ""natural"" sources)is available from only one source, such as a mail-order companyis promoted through infomercialsis described as ""miraculous"""
Best foods for new moms: Mood boosters,https://www.babycenter.com/0_best-foods-for-new-moms-mood-boosters_1458835.bc,"It's not uncommon to feel down for the first couple of weeks after childbirth. You're recovering physically from labor and delivery, dealing with postpartum hormonal swings, and adjusting to life with the newest  and most demanding  member of your family. All this can leave you feeling exhausted, cranky, and anxious.And while feeding yourself may be last on your to-do list, eating healthy food, having regular meals and snacks, and taking a few simple steps can boost yourenergy leveland your mood. Read on for our best nutrition tips.Editor's note: If you suspect you're suffering frompostpartum depression(PPD) rather than a temporary case of the""baby blues,"" tell your care provider right away.PPD is a serious condition that requires treatment. A healthy diet can improve your mood, but it can't substitute for professional help. Warning signs of PPD include insomnia, a change in appetite, weepiness or sadness that persists all day, and thoughts of harming yourself or your baby.Stock up on omega-3 fatty acidsExperts agree that omega-3s fatty acids  found mainly in fish and some nuts and seeds  are important to include in a healthy diet. They help your body function normally and protect against heart disease. And some studies show lower overall rates of depression (including a lower incidence of postpartum depression among new moms) in countries where people eat large amounts of fish.Pediatrician James Sears, coauthor ofThe Baby Book, advises new mothers to stock up on foods rich in omega-3 fatty acids, like wild salmon, flaxseed oil, and walnuts. He believes these enhance brain function and can help with depression. ""Omega-3 oils really help the brain work better,"" Sears says.The Institute of Medicine recommends women consume 1.1 grams (1,100 mg) of omega-3 fatty acids every day. Breastfeeding women should get slightly more, about 1.3 grams. The following foods each provide about 1 gram of omega-3 fatty acid:1 tablespoon walnut oil = 1.4 grams1 ounce black walnuts = 0.6 gram1 tablespoon canola oil = 1.3 grams1 tablespoon ground flaxseeds = 1.6 grams1 1/2 ounces herring = 1 gram2 1/2 ounces of Atlantic salmon = 1 gram4 ounces of canned white tuna = 1 gramOmega-3-fortified eggs are also an option. Two eggs provide about half the daily amount recommended above, depending on the brand.Consider taking a supplement if you don't like the taste of fish or if you're eating fish less often because ofmercury concerns. (Nursing moms should eat 8 to 12 ounces of cooked fish or canned ""light"" tuna and up to 6 ounces of canned albacore tuna a week, according to joint guidelines from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Environmental Protection Agency.)Omega-3 supplements made from fish oils are considered safe for nursing moms. According to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, they don't have detectable levels of mercury or toxins. But skip cod liver oil supplements if you're breastfeeding because they can contain excessive amounts of vitamins A and D.If you're taking a supplement, read the label to determine how much omega-3 fatty acid each capsule contains, and ask your doctor to recommend a dosage for you. Starting with a low dose and gradually increasing it or taking the pills with meals lessens the chance of having side effects like diarrhea, bloating, and nausea. Don't skimp on proteinIt's especially important to get enough protein in your diet now, says Shoshana Bennett, a psychologist on the advisory council of Postpartum Support International (PSI), an advocacy and support group for women with PPD.Bennett says that eating small amounts of protein throughout the day helps keep blood sugar levels even and moods stable. And consuming dairy products, poultry, meat, and fish  along with low-glycemic carbs like nuts, whole grains, and beans  can boost production of serotonin, a neurotransmitter which has a calming effect on the brain.To get more protein in your diet, try having scrambled eggs for breakfast, a turkey or roast beef sandwich for lunch, and yogurt or cheese and crackers for a snack.The total amount of protein you need daily depends on how much you weigh and whether you're nursing. The average range is 50 to 85 grams of protein a day for nursing moms, and 30 to 55 grams for moms who aren't nursing.If you're very petite or on the heavier side, your protein requirement might fall outside these ranges. Check the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food planning tool, MyPlate to find out how much protein you need.These are some good sources of protein:3 ounces chicken, turkey, or meat = 20 to 25 grams protein3 ounces fish = about 20 grams proteinTwo 8-ounce glasses milk = 16 grams proteinTwo 8-ounce glasses soy milk = 14 grams proteinTwo large eggs = 12 grams protein2 ounces Swiss cheese = 16 grams protein1/2 block firm tofu = 14 grams protein1 cup cottage cheese = 22 to 31 grams protein1 cup plain low-fat yogurt = 12 grams protein2 ounces dry-roasted peanuts = 14 grams protein1 cup cooked beans, such as chickpeas (garbanzo beans), kidney beans, baked beans, pinto beans, refried beans, or black beans = 12 to 19 grams protein1 cup cooked lentils = 18 grams proteinDrink plenty of liquidDehydration may make the blues worse. Fatigue and anxiety are actually symptoms of moderate dehydration. So drink at least nine 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day (about 13 glasses if you're breastfeeding). Choose water or noncaffeinated beverages that aren't sweetened with sugar.Also, don't wait to drink until you feel thirsty. (By the time you notice your thirst, mild dehydration may have already kicked in.) This is especially important if you're breastfeeding because nursing can make you extra thirsty. Grab a tall glass of water, juice, or even decaf iced tea every time you sit down to nurse your baby. Limit your alcohol intakeThough it may give you a quick buzz, alcohol is a depressant, so limit your drinking until you're on a more even keel. An occasional glass of wine in the evening to unwind isn't a problem, but regular heavy drinking may make your mood worse and disrupt your sleep. Depression and alcoholism often go hand in hand, so if you feel like your drinking is spiraling out of control, talk to your healthcare provider.There are other reasons to abstain from drinking during the postpartum period. Having more than an infrequent drink can affect yourability to nurseand take care of your child.Moderate your caffeine intakeA cup or two of coffee can get you going in the morning, but if you're guzzling caffeinated beverages all day long, you're more likely to end up jittery, frazzled, and unable to sleep at night. ""Caffeine is public enemy number one  it is horrible for anxiety,"" says Bennett. ""It makes people agitated, irritable, and restless,"" she says, noting that those are also symptoms of mood disorders.Plus, if you're breastfeeding, doctors recommend having no more than300 mg of caffeine a day (about what you'd get in two 8-ounce cups of coffee) to avoid affecting your baby.Abruptly giving up all caffeine can cause temporary headaches, lethargy, and crankiness. So if you drink a lot of the stuff, don't just quit cold turkey. Slowly cut back to a few caffeinated beverages a day  or none if you want to be caffeine-free.Go for dark chocolate when you're craving sweetsIt's easy to reach for junk food when you're tired and need some quick calories, but try to resist the urge. Junk food may give you a temporary lift, but that surge comes with an eventual crash. If you do indulge occasionally, don't beat yourself up about it. ""If you have to eat something with a lot of sugar, eat some chocolate,"" says registered dietitian Jo Ann Hattner.High-quality dark chocolate  at least 70 percent cocoa  can improve mood by increasing the serotonin level in your brain. And some studies indicate that chocolate consumption triggers the release of endorphins, brain chemicals responsible for euphoric feelings.Don't forget your vitaminsAlthough a supplement is no substitute for a healthy diet rich infruits and veggies, it can be difficult to cover all your nutritional bases during those first few busy weeks with a new baby. So keep taking yourprenatal vitaminfor a couple months postpartum.Prenatal vitamins generally contain more iron than regular multivitamins, which is important because your iron stores may be depleted after pregnancy and giving birth (especially if you had a cesarean section). Low iron levels can leave you feeling fatigued and down. Also, antioxidants  including vitamins A, C, and E  may improve overall brain function, according to Bennett.Pay attention to your appetiteIt's normal to skip meals and forget to eat on a regular schedule during the harried first weeks of caring for a newborn. But if you find that you're rarely hungry and eating is a chore, your loss of appetite may be a symptom of postpartum depression.Eating poorly can also contribute to mood problems. Your body needs regular, balanced meals and snacks to keep blood sugar levels stable. When they're not, it can affect your mood. If you consistently have to force yourself to eat, talk to your care provider.More informationThe USDA's MyPlate tool offers a customized daily food plan based on your age, gender, and activity level.Get recipes forquick, nutritious snacks for time-starved moms.See ourdiet for a healthy breastfeeding momanddiet for healthy postpartum weight loss.Visit ourMom's Nutrition: Postpartumindex page.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

How the Affordable Care Act (ACA) affects pregnant women and families,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-the-affordable-care-act-aca-affects-pregnant-women-and-f_10371090.bc,"Landmark legislationThe Affordable Care Act (ACA), signed into law in March 2010 and put into effect in 2014, is the most significant healthcare legislation since 1965, when Medicare and Medicaid were created. Not only does ""Obamacare"" make healthcare available to people who were formerly unable to get insurance, but for women in particular it eliminates unfair obstacles to getting care.The ACA requires all US citizens and legal residents to obtain basic health insurance coverage or pay a fine. Exemptions are possible under certain circumstances. And if you don't have affordable job-based coverage, you're able to take part in insurance exchanges that allow you to compare plans and find affordable healthcare.Low- to middle-income earners may qualify for subsidies to help them afford insurance. And some low-income families will qualify for Medicaid in states that opt to expand that program.In addition, the ACA establishes a series of benefits and protections, some of which are particularly important for women and children.Does my plan offer all the ACA protections and benefits?There are some protections that all insurers are required to provide. But there are other benefits you may receive only if you don't have a grandfathered insurance plan (plans created since March 23, 2010  the day the law was signed). Most plans aren't grandfathered, but if you have a grandfathered plan that doesn't currently provide ACA benefits, you may want to shop around.ACA rights and protectionsIf you're happy with your family's coverage, you may not notice much difference. But for those who have been struggling to get coverage or make sense of their plans, the ACA may offer some relief. Below is a list of benefits offered by non-grandfathered plans.Readable benefits and coverage summaries: All health insurance companies are now required to provide you with an easy-to-understand summary of their plan's benefits and coverage. They must all use the same standard form so that you can easily compare their offerings.Consumer assistance services: All states are now required to provide consumer assistance programs (CAP) to help you with health insurance problems, such as when your insurer refuses to pay for a needed treatment or when you need to file a complaint or choose new coverage. Only 13 states have them so far, though, so you may be referred to another agency depending on where you live. Find out what your state offers.No dropping coverage for a paperwork mistake: Plans can no longer cancel your insurance because you or your employer made a mistake on your application.Coverage for those with preexisting conditions: Plans can no longer deny or limit coverage due to a preexisting condition.No more lifetime and annual limits: Plans can no longer put an annual or lifetime dollar limit on the essential covered benefits you receive.No unreasonable rate hikes: Whenever an insurer wants to raise premiums 10 percent or more for an individual or small group policy, they must get the increase approved by independent evaluators and must clearly explain the reasons for the increase to consumers.Choice of doctors: Plans must allow you to choose the primary care doctor or pediatrician you want from your health plan's provider network.Easier access to ob-gyns: Plans must allow you to see an ob-gyn without a referral from another doctor.Emergency care access: Plans must allow you to seek emergency care at a hospital outside your plan's network for your usual copayment and without prior approval from your health plan.Young adult coverage: Plans must allow you to add or keep your children on your policy until they turn 26 years old, even if they're attending school or not living with you.New rules for appeals: All plans must follow ACA rules regarding how they handle appeals when they deny payment. They must tell you why your claim was denied and alert you to your right to request an internal appeal. If you appeal, they must respond with a decision within two months or less. If the insurer denies your appeal, you have the right to request an external review by an independent organization.You may even get a refund: For individual and small group policies, insurers must spend at least 80 percent of premiums on medical care versus overhead, salaries, and marketing. (For large group policies, the amount is 85 percent.) In 2013, nearly 7 million Americans received either a rebate check or a reduction in future premiums when their insurance company failed to spend the required amount on medical care.ACA benefits: Free preventive servicesOne of the most important benefits of the ACA is comprehensive coverage of preventive services. This means that insurance plans must now pay the bill for many treatments and tests that can help you and your family stay healthy, with no copay from you. (Again, only non-grandfathered plans must provide this coverage.)Below are the preventive care services for women and young children that plans must now cover in full when delivered by an in-network provider. See a complete list of covered services here.For all womenWell-woman visits: An annual preventive care visit to your heathcare provider and any additional visits that are necessary to receive the following preventive services.Contraception and contraceptive counseling: All contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration, including sterilization procedures, and patient education and counseling. (Some religiously affiliated employers may be exempt.)Folic acid supplements: Experts recommend that all women capable of getting pregnant take 400 micrograms of folic acid a day to reduce the risk of having a baby with a neural tube defect.HPV DNA testing: Human papillomavirus (HPV) DNA testing every three years, regardless of Pap smear results, for women who are 30 or older.Breast cancer screening: Mammograms every 1 to 2 years for women who are 40 or older. Counseling and screening for breast cancer gene mutations and preventive medication counseling for women at high risk.STI and HIV screening and counseling: Annual counseling on sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and screening for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection for all sexually active women. Annual screening for chlamydia, gonorrhea, and syphilis for women at high risk.Domestic violence screening and counseling: Annual screening and counseling for interpersonal and domestic violence for all adolescent and adult women.For pregnant womenPrenatal care visits: All preconception and prenatal care visits.Alcohol misuse screening and counseling: For all adults. (All public health officials in the United States recommend that pregnant women avoid alcohol entirely.)Tobacco counseling and cessation intervention: For all adults, with expanded counseling for pregnant women. Find help quitting smoking.Rh incompatibility screening: Your blood will be screened to determine your Rh status at your first prenatal care appointment. (If there's a chance this blood protein is incompatible with your baby's, you'll need to take certain precautions.)Iron deficiency anemia screening: Your blood will be tested for anemia at your first prenatal care appointment and again later in pregnancy.Gestational diabetes screening: You'll most likely get screened for gestational diabetes between 24 and 28 weeks of pregnancy, or at your first prenatal visit if you're at high risk.Infection screening: Screenings for infections that can affect your baby, including hepatitis B, chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and urinary tract infections (UTIs).Breastfeeding support, supplies, and counseling: Comprehensive lactation support and counseling from trained providers during pregnancy and postpartum. Includes breast pump purchase or rental (your plan will determine what type of pump, manual or electric, and whether you get to keep or rent).For young childrenFor newborns: Gonorrhea preventive medication for the eyes. Screening for congenital hypothyroidism, hearing problems, phenylketonuria (PKU), and sickle cell anemia.For all children: Immunizations; medical history; blood pressure screening; hematocrit or hemoglobin screening; vision screening; developmental screening; behavioral assessments; height, weight, and body mass index measurements; and obesity screening and counseling.Oral health risk assessment for young children.Fluoride supplements for children without fluoride in their water source.Iron supplements for children 6 to 12 months old at risk for anemia.Lead screening for children at risk of exposure.Autism screening for children at 18 and 24 months.Tuberculosis testing for children at higher risk.Dyslipidemia screening for children at higher risk of lipid disorders.Learn moreVisit the website of your current insurance company to learn how the ACA affects your coverage, or go to healthcare.gov to enroll."
Feeding problems: Anemia,https://www.babycenter.com/0_feeding-problems-anemia_9205.bc,"What is anemia?When young children develop anemia, the usual cause is a lack of dietary iron. This mineral nourishes the body's red blood cells so they can create hemoglobin, which helps carry oxygen throughout the body.Babies are born with a store of iron that usually lasts up to six months. It's not unusual for children between 4 and 6 months of age to develop mild anemia as their body's supply of iron becomes depleted. Feeding your baby breast milk or iron-fortified formula helps replenish this supply.Also, anemia can develop around 6 months of age when babies start solids and drink less formula or breast milk. Babies born prematurely and exclusively breastfed infants may deplete their stores of iron earlier even earlier.Signs of anemiaSigns of anemia are often subtle. More often than not, your child won't have any symptoms at all. When they do occur, symptoms may include:Looking paleHaving fingernails lacking in colorHaving low energyWhat you can doYour pediatrician checks for anemia during regular checkups and may test hemoglobin levels with a blood sample between 9 and 12 months.If anemia is confirmed, you may need to start giving your child iron-rich foods, such as red meats, fortified cereals, and beans. It's also important to serve foods rich in vitamin C, such as orange juice, because they enhance iron absorption. (Don't give juice to babies younger than 6 months and limit the amount of juice your baby drinks to no more than 1/2 a cup daily.)Iron supplements also help. The American Academy of Pediatrics even recommends giving strictly breastfed babies iron supplements after 4 months as a preventive measure until they start eating iron-rich solid foods. But check with your child's doctor first because regular use of iron supplements can cause stomach upset.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012. Anemia and your child.

Cystic fibrosis in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_cystic-fibrosis-in-babies_10869.bc,"What is cystic fibrosis?Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a life-threatening genetic disease. A child with CF has a faulty gene that affects the movement of sodium chloride (salt) in and out of certain cells.The result is thick, heavy, sticky mucus; salty sweat; and thickened digestive juices. The thick mucus secretions can clog the lungs, making a child with CF very prone to breathing difficulties, lung infections (the mucus provides a rich environment for bacteria), and, eventually, severe lung damage. And when thickened digestive fluids from the child's pancreas can't get to the small intestine to break down and absorb nutrients from the food she eats, she may also have digestive and growth problems.What are the signs and symptoms of cystic fibrosis in babies?Fifteen to 20 percent of newborn babies with cystic fibrosis have something called meconium ileus at birth. This means their small intestine is obstructed with meconium, the seaweed-green substance that comes out in a baby's first poop. Sometimes the intestine will become twisted or not develop properly as a result. The meconium can also obstruct the large intestine, in which case the baby won't have a bowel movement for one or two days after birth.Other babies with CF are fine at birth but then develop problems breathing or can't seem to put on weight in their first four to six weeks. Poor growth is one of the first signs of CF. Parents may also notice a nagging cough and wheezing.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.Coughing and wheezing are hardly unique to children with CF, of course. These symptoms could be caused by viral bronchiolitis (an inflammation of the small breathing tubes), asthma, pneumonia, or even a dusty, smoky environment. Each of these conditions is far more common than any genetic disease.Still, cystic fibrosis is the most common life-shortening genetic disease among people of Northern European descent. Other symptoms include salty skin, a big appetite with no weight gain, and large, greasy stools.Sometimes the condition doesn't become apparent until a child has had a series of repeated lung infections or severe growth problems. If your baby has any of these symptoms, talk with his doctor.Cystic fibrosis can't be cured. But there are new treatments that can not only prolong a child's life but may also help make that life more normal. And the earlier CF is diagnosed, the more effective those therapies will be. How common is cystic fibrosis?The chances of your baby having CF are about 1 in 3,000 if your baby is Caucasian, 1 in 9,000 if she's Hispanic, 1 in 11,000 if she's Native American, 1 in 15,000 if she's of African heritage, and 1 in 30,000 if she's Asian American.Babies get cystic fibrosis when they inherit one defective CF gene from their mother and another from their father. (More than 10 million Americans carry the CF gene  most without knowing it.) Children with the disease are usually diagnosed before the age of 2, but about 10 percent of cases go undetected until adulthood.How can I find out whether my baby has CF?Newborn babies in the United States (and in many countries worldwide) are routinely tested for CF. A small spot of blood is taken from the baby's heel and tested for a protein that is higher in babies with CF. If the result is too high, a further test is done to look for the most common mutations that cause CF.Newborn screening isn't 100 percent accurate. Rarely, a baby who has CF will be missed by this test. But more commonly a baby who does not have CF will be referred for a more definitive test (a sweat test) to make sure he doesn't have the disease.If there's any reason to suspect that your baby might have CF  because of symptoms, a newborn screening test, or because you know it runs in the family  the doctor will perform a sweat test.The sweat test is quick and painless: A drug called pilocarpine stimulates a spot on the arm to sweat. The doctor places a piece of filter paper on the area to absorb the sweat and then tests its sodium and chloride content. Higher-than-normal levels strongly suggest cystic fibrosis. A family history of CF and other tests, such as a chest X-ray and blood or saliva genetic tests, may add to the evidence.Genetic testing can determine whether a couple planning a pregnancy needs to be concerned about cystic fibrosis. Both parents would have to be carriers of the CF gene for the baby to have a risk of being born with the disease. Most ob-gyns offer this testing to expectant parents. If the test comes back positive, the couple would be referred to a genetic counselor. However, there are several thousand DNA mutations that can cause CF, and most ob-gyns test for only the most common 30 or 40 of these. So it's possible to be told you aren't a CF carrier when in fact you are.How is the disease treated?Babies and children with cystic fibrosis need ongoing medical care. This is best provided at a specialized CF center with a team of doctors, nurses, and others who have expertise in the disease. Symptoms vary greatly from child to child, even when they are siblings with the same genetic defect. Often symptoms come and go  they may be relatively mild or frighteningly severe.The vast majority of young children with CF can be treated as outpatients, but they need to be seen frequently to make sure the disease is being treated properly. At each visit a sputum (saliva or mucus) sample is taken to help determine which germs are causing lung infections. Occasionally, if symptoms flare up, the child has to be admitted to the hospital to get intravenous antibiotics.If your baby has CF, she should receive routine childhood vaccines against such common illnesses as Hib and pertussis, as well as an annual flu shot (once she's six months old).Most kids with CF are also given prescription medications, including antibiotics to treat infection, medicines that help break up mucus in the lungs, and drugs that reduce the inflammation that causes lung destruction. Each child responds best to a different combination of physical and drug therapies, and it's the job of the doctors and the parents to find the right mix. Parents play an important role by watching how their child responds to different drugs.Researchers are working on other treatment options as well, including gene therapy (to replace the gene that causes the disease), drugs that help move salt in and out of the cells properly, and new drugs to prevent and treat infections.To loosen mucus in your baby's lungs, the doctor will probably show you how to thump your baby's chest with a cupped hand. You may need to do this a couple of times each day for about 30 minutes each time. There are also electric devices  like a chest clapper and a vibrating vest  that can perform this task.Because the disease usually gums up the pancreas, your baby will need help with her digestion as well. Without easy access to pancreatic enzymes, the small intestine has trouble breaking down food, especially fat, leaving children with CF undernourished and hungry. Much of what they eat passes through their body without being absorbed.The doctor may decide that your baby needs to take a pancreatic enzyme supplement with every meal to help her body absorb the food she eats. (You'll need to open the capsule and mix the tiny beads with a little baby food.) You'll also want to encourage your baby to eat as frequently as possible and give her any nutritional supplements the doctor recommends.Proper nutrition is vital because a child who is otherwise strong, healthy, and well nourished gives all the CF therapies a better chance to provide some relief. Your baby's doctor will determine exactly which supplements  and how much of them  your baby needs to take.The good news is that, in many cases, babies with CF can grow to lead nearly normal lives, going to school with everyone else, playing on the playground, and being a kid, even if the adults around her are being more vigilant. The prospects for children with cystic fibrosis keep getting better: Several decades ago most babies with CF died by their teens. Today, the life expectancy of a child born with cystic fibrosis is about 37 years.Where can I find more information about cystic fibrosis?The universe of people with cystic fibrosis and their loved ones is large, well informed, and supportive.

Pantothenic acid in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pantothenic-acid-in-your-pregnancy-diet_657.bc,"Why you need pantothenic acid during pregnancyPantothenic acid, also known as vitamin B5, is essential for the production of hormones and cholesterol and for the metabolism of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats.

Medical conditions your preemie may face,https://www.babycenter.com/0_medical-conditions-your-preemie-may-face_10300030.bc,"Many complications are more likely in premature babies than in full-term babies. But the longer a premature baby has to develop in the womb, the less severe the complications tend to be. Late preterm babies generally have few or mild problems.Babies born before 32 to 34 weeks may have a number of complications, ranging from mild to severe. Here are some of the most common:AnemiaPremature infants often are anemic, which means they don't have enough red blood cells. Normally, the baby stores iron during the later months of pregnancy and uses it late in pregnancy and after birth to make red blood cells. Infants born too soon may not have had enough time to build up a supply of iron.Babies with anemia tend to develop feeding problems and grow more slowly. Anemia also can worsen any heart or breathing problems. Anemic infants may be treated with dietary iron supplements, drugs that increase red blood cell production, or, in severe cases, blood transfusion.ApneaPremature babies sometimes stop breathing for 15 seconds or more. This interruption in breathing is called apnea, and it may be accompanied by a slow heart rate.Premature babies are constantly monitored for apnea. If a baby stops breathing, a nurse stimulates the baby to start breathing by patting him or touching the soles of his feet.Chronic lung diseaseChronic lung disease  also called bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD  most commonly affects premature infants who require ongoing treatment with supplemental oxygen. Babies at risk for BPD include those who had severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) and needed long treatment with breathing equipment and oxygen.These babies develop fluid in the lungs, scarring, and lung damage, which can be seen on an X-ray. Affected babies are treated with medications that make breathing easier and are slowly weaned from the ventilator.Their lungs usually improve over the first two years of life. However, many children develop chronic lung disease resembling asthma. InfectionsPremature babies have an immature immune system that can't fight off bacteria, viruses, and other organisms that can cause infection.Serious infections that are commonly seen in premature babies include pneumonia (lung infection), sepsis (blood infection), and meningitis (infection of the membranes surrounding the brain and spinal cord).Babies can get these infections at birth from their mother, or they may become infected after birth. Infections are treated with antibiotics or antiviral drugs.Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)Intraventricular hemorrhage (IVH)  or bleeding in the brain  occurs in some premature babies, with the smallest babies (those weighing about 3 pounds or less) at highest risk. The bleeds usually occur in the first three days of life and generally are diagnosed with an ultrasound examination.Most brain bleeds are mild and resolve themselves with no or few lasting problems. More severe bleeds can make the fluid-filled structures (ventricles) in the brain expand rapidly, causing pressure on the brain that can lead to cerebral palsy as well as learning and behavioral problems.In such cases, surgeons may insert a tube into the brain to drain the fluid and reduce the risk of brain damage. In milder cases, drugs sometimes can reduce fluid buildup.JaundicePremature babies are more likely than full-term babies to develop jaundicebecause their liver is too immature to remove a waste product called bilirubin from the blood.In addition, premature infants may be more sensitive to the ill effects of excess bilirubin. Babies with jaundice have a yellowish color to their skin and eyes. Jaundice often is mild and usually isn't harmful. However, if the bilirubin level gets too high, it can cause brain damage.This generally can be prevented because blood tests can show bilirubin levels that are too high, so the baby can be treated with special lights (phototherapy) that help the body eliminate bilirubin. Occasionally, a baby may need a blood transfusion. Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC)Some premature babies develop this potentially dangerous intestinal problem two to three weeks after birth. The bowel may become damaged when its blood supply is reduced. Bacteria that are normally present in the bowel invade the damaged area, causing more damage, which can lead to feeding difficulties, abdominal swelling, and other complications.Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) can be diagnosed with imaging tests, such as X-rays and blood tests. Affected babies are treated with antibiotics and fed through a vein (intravenously) while the bowel heals. In some cases, surgery is necessary to remove damaged sections of the intestine.Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA)Patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) is a heart problem that's common in premature babies. Before birth, a large artery called the ductus arteriosus lets the blood bypass the lungs because the fetus gets its oxygen through the placenta.The ductus normally closes soon after birth so that blood can travel to the lungs and pick up oxygen. When the ductus does not close properly, it can lead to heart failure.PDA can be diagnosed with a specialized form of ultrasound (echocardiography) or other imaging tests. Babies with PDA are treated with a drug that helps close the ductus, although surgery may be necessary if the drug doesn't work.Respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)Babies born before 34 weeks of pregnancy often develop this serious breathing problem.Babies with RDS lack a protein called surfactant that keeps small air sacs in the lungs from collapsing.Treatment with surfactant helps affected babies breathe more easily. Since treatment with surfactant was introduced in 1990, death from RDS has been reduced by about half.A doctor may suspect a baby has RDS if he's struggling to breathe. A lung X-ray and blood tests often confirm the diagnosis. Along with surfactant treatment, babies with RDS may need additional oxygen and mechanical breathing assistance to keep their lungs expanded.They may receive a treatment called continuous positive airway pressure (C-PAP), which delivers pressurized air to the baby's lungs. The air may be delivered through small tubes inserted into the baby's nose or windpipe.C-PAP helps a baby breathe, but it doesn't breathe for them. The sickest babies may temporarily need a respirator while their lungs mature.Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP)Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is an abnormal growth of blood vessels in the eye that can lead to vision loss. It occurs mainly in babies born before 30 weeks of pregnancy. ROP is diagnosed during an examination by an eye doctor (ophthalmologist).Most cases are mild and heal themselves with little or no vision loss. In more severe cases, the ophthalmologist may treat the abnormal vessels with a laser or by freezing them (cryotherapy) to protect the retina and preserve vision.Show sources Hide sources March of Dimes. 2011.

Vitamin A in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-a-in-your-childs-diet_10324693.bc,"Vitamin A is crucial for children's good health and development. Read on to find out how much vitamin A your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Why vitamin A is importantVitamin A plays an important role in vision and bone growth and helps protect the body from infections. Vitamin A also promotes the health and growth of cells and tissues in the body, particularly those in the hair, nails, and skin.How much vitamin A does my child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 1,000 international units (IU), or 300 micrograms (mcg) retinol activity equivalents (RAE), of vitamin A per dayAge 4 years and up: 1,333 IU, or 400 mcg RAE per dayYour child doesn't have to get enough vitamin A every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of vitamin AColorful fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamin A. Here are some of the best sources:1/2 cup carrot juice: 22,567 IU1/4 cup cooked sweet potato: 12,907 IUone raw carrot (7 1/2 inches): 8,666 IU1/4 cup cooked carrots: 6,709 IU1/4 cup cooked spinach: 5,729 IU1/4 cup butternut squash: 5,717 IU1/4 cup cooked kale: 4,979 IU1/2 cup canned vegetable soup: 2,910 IU1/4 cup cantaloupe: 1,352 IU1/4 cup apricots, packed in juice: 1,031 IU1/4 cup red bell pepper: 720 IU1/4 cup raw spinach: 703 IU1/4 cup sliced mango: 631 IU1/2 cup fortified instant oatmeal, prepared with water: 626 IU1/4 cup cooked broccoli: 603 IU1/4 cup cooked frozen peas: 525 IU1/2 cup tomato juice: 546 IU1/2 cup fortified milk: 250 IU1/4 cup canned peaches, packed in juice: 236 IU1/2 large egg, scrambled: 160 IU1/2 ounce cheddar cheese: 142 IU1/4 cup green bell pepper: 137 IU1/4 cup fresh peaches: 125 IU1/4 cup papaya: 83 IUThe amount of vitamin A in a food varies somewhat, depending on the size of the fruit or vegetable.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts of food shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much vitamin A?Yes. Normally, the body has to convert vitamin A from its inactive form to its active form, so the body can use it. Usually an excess of vitamin A is from taking supplements that already contain high levels of the active form of the vitamin.It's also possible to get too much of the active form of vitamin A from animal sources, like liver and milk. For example, beef liver contains 21,566 IU per slice.By contrast, it's nearly impossible to overdose by getting an abundance of carotenoids, the orange and yellow pigments in carrots and other vegetables and fruits. When you eat vitamin A from these nonanimal sources, the body converts only what it needs from carotenoids to the active form of vitamin A. What will most likely happen if you go on a carrot binge is that your skin will turn yellow-orange (and that effect disappears once you go back to eating a balanced diet).How much vitamin A is too much?Children ages 1 to 3 should not get more than 2,000 IU (600 mcg RAE) a day. Children ages 4 to 8 should not get more than 3,000 IU (900 mcg RAE).Those are the maximum amounts considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine. Don't give your child a vitamin supplement that contains more than the recommended amounts of vitamin A that your child needs every day.Too much of the active form of vitamin A can cause nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, and lack of muscle coordination. Long-term effects include osteoporosis, liver problems, and disorders of the central nervous system.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for children"
Choline in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_choline-in-your-pregnancy-diet_10325647.bc,"Why you need choline during pregnancyCholine is an important nutrient that helps your baby's brain and spinal cord develop properly.

You don't have to get the recommended amount of choline every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Food sources of cholineEggs, meat and fish, and some whole grain cereals are good sources of choline.

You may be able to get enough choline by eating a varied diet, but some women don't get enough choline from diet alone. You probably wouldn't notice any signs or symptoms of inadequate choline in your diet, but if you worry that you're falling short, ask your healthcare provider if you need a supplement or aprenatal vitaminthat includes choline.The signs of a choline deficiencyA choline deficiency can cause fat to accumulate in the liver and lead to liver disease.This may show up as elevated ALT (alanine aminotransferase) and reduced VLDL (very low density lipoprotein) levels in the blood. A choline deficiency can also cause elevated levels of the amino acid homocysteine.Show sources Hide sources IOM. 2010.

Helping a child who's underweight (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_helping-a-child-whos-underweight-ages-5-to-8_66923.bc,"How can I tell if my child is too skinny?There are several factors to take into consideration when evaluating your child's weight. Has he always been thin? Are both of his parents very thin? A child who has a genetic tendency to be thin is in a different boat than a child who has always been normal to hefty and who has recently stopped gaining  or started losing  weight. Even if your child has just recently thinned out, though, there may be nothing to worry about.""Keep in mind that a child's weight is dynamic and changes with growth,"" says Stephen R. Daniels, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition.When an increase in height precedes a gain in weight, Daniels explains, your child may appear underweight for a while, until his weight gain catches up. It's also possible, though, for your child's weight gain to eventually outstrip his gain in height, resulting in his becoming overweight. Doctors are very concerned that many children are becoming overweight as they grow older, Daniels says, and some of those children started out as underweight.The best way to determine whether your child is underweight  and to find out what to do about it  is to make an appointment with his doctor so she can help you evaluate his weight and his diet.How will the doctor determine whether my child is underweight?Your child's doctor will take into consideration the factors mentioned above  how much his parents weigh and how long he's been thin. She'll also evaluate your child's eating habits and his overall health. She'll probably ask if your child has had any medical problems that may have contributed to weight loss, like chronic diarrhea or vomiting.The doctor will measure your child's height and weight and plot these numbers on a growth chart. Doctors today are using a new series of growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that take into consideration a child's body mass index, or BMI, which considers weight together with height to help determine whether they are proportional. The BMI is a better indicator of body composition than a weight measurement alone. While an adult's BMI is calculated with a straight formula of height and weight, the formula to determine a child's BMI takes into consideration gender and age as well, to allow for the fact that body composition changes as a child gets older.If your child's BMI falls below the 5th percentile, he's considered underweight. The doctor will ask you questions about your child's diet, so she can pinpoint any major deficiencies. She may have you refer to the Food Guide Pyramid, so you can determine which food groups your child may not be getting enough of. She'll do a physical examination and may run laboratory tests to determine if there's an underlying medical cause, especially if your child seems to be eating well but not gaining weight. How can I help my child gain weight?Assuming your child has no underlying medical concerns, the idea will be to get him to take in more calories. For some children, simply adding foods that are ""heart-healthy"" sources of fat such as avocados, nuts, and vegetable oils  provides enough additional calories to meet the demands of growth. Try to plan healthy, calorie-dense meals and snacks for your child so he gets enough to eat.Whatever you do, don't feed your child ""junk food"" in an effort to promote weight gain, warns Daniels. Eating habits are ingrained early in life, and they may be difficult to change once they become established.Make mealtimes pleasant and unrushed. Sit down together whenever you can and enjoy your food and time together. Involve your child in meal planning, shopping (enlist his help picking out fruit at the market and bread at the bakery, for example), and food preparation, to encourage his interest in food and eating. Also, don't let your child get so wrapped up doing something that he skips meals. He needs to be eating frequently if you want him to gain weight.Here is a list of healthy high-calorie foods that you might offer your child:Dairy: Whole milk, cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, creamed soups, puddingProtein: Eggs, peanut butter, bean soups, nutsCarbohydrates: Bread, macaroni and cheese, pasta, French toast, pancakes, mashed potatoes, hot cerealIf your child is a picky eater and refuses to add new foods to his diet, his doctor may recommend a high-calorie supplement drink. These supplements taste like milkshakes and provide additional vitamins and minerals that your child may be missing out on.Make sure, though, that your child isn't filling up on beverages  like juices or even milk  so that he's not hungry for meals. Try to limit juice to no more than one cup a day and milk to no more than two cups a day.While you'll be eager to check on his progress, don't start subjecting your child to regular weigh-ins at home, because they may make him anxious and self-conscious about his weight. However, your doctor may want to see your child once a month to monitor his progress. Treat these visits like any other to the doctor, and don't make a big deal about the weigh-in process.What if my child doesn't start gaining weight?If your child is getting enough calories but still does not seem to be gaining weight appropriately, continue to work with his doctor to discover any underlying conditions. On the other hand, if your child is refusing to eat, there may be a psychological reason that you'll want to discuss with a child therapist. Your child's doctor can provide a referral.Chances are good, though, that with some patience and some conscientious meal and snack plans, your child will strike a good height/weight balance."
Pregnant and underweight: How to get the nutrients you need,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pregnant-and-underweight-how-to-get-the-nutrients-you-need_1313894.bc,"How many pounds should I gain during pregnancy?Most women who start off their pregnancies underweight are advised to gain between 28 and 40 pounds  a bit more than the standard recommendation of 25 to 35 pounds. The March of Dimes suggests that if you begin your pregnancy underweight you try to gain slightly over a pound a week in the second and third trimesters (assuming you gain between 1 and 4 1/2 pounds in the first trimester).However, your doctor or midwife may make a different recommendation based on your individual situation, particularly if you have a history of eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia.If you need help gaining the extra weight, seek out a registered dietitian. (Ask your healthcare provider for a recommendation.)Not sure if you were underweight before you were pregnant? View a body mass index (BMI) chart to find out. You're considered underweight if you have a BMI of less than 18.5. (Your BMI reflects the relationship between your height and weight.)Pregnancy weight gain trackerSee your target weight range for pregnancy and whether your weight gain is on track.Does being underweight pose any risks to my baby or me?If you're underweight at the start of your pregnancy, you have a greater risk of having a preterm birth or a small for gestational age (SGA) baby. This puts the baby at risk for a host of problems. However, gaining enough weight  and gaining consistently throughout your pregnancy  reduces this risk.How can I make sure I'm getting all the nutrients I need?To begin with, like all pregnant women, you need to be taking a folic acid supplement to reduce your baby's risk of a neural tube defect. In fact, experts recommend taking 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid per day, beginning at least a month before you start trying to get pregnant. Some experts advise raising the dose to at least 600 mcg per day once you're pregnant.Other than that, the bulk of your nourishment should come from whole foods, but a prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement can help make up for some shortcomings. Your doctor or midwife will probably recommend that you start taking one as soon as you find out you're pregnant, if not before.If you're not sure you can stick to a healthy diet on your own, a registered dietitian can help you come up with a sensible meal plan and even provide you with simple recipes that include the foods rich in the vitamins and minerals that are essential to a healthy baby.Use our handy pregnancy food diary to make sure you're getting enough calories and nutrients and drinking plenty of water every day. The diary is also useful for tracking your mood and hunger levels, so you can spot patterns you may need to change.How can I stay on track with weight gain?Choose plenty of nutritious foods that contain some healthy fat and adequate calories. Here are four easy ways to get more calories:Eat breakfast every day. Add some peanut butter or a slice of cheese to your morning toast for an extra protein boost.Add a couple of slices of avocado and a handful of nuts or seeds to your salads for extra protein and healthy fat.Eat two or three snacks between meals. Choose foods like yogurt (for protein and calcium), dried fruit (for vitamins, minerals, and fiber), or a fruit and yogurt smoothie (for protein, calcium, vitamins, and minerals).Replace soda with milk (for protein and calcium) or juices that are high in vitamin C or beta carotene, an antioxidant. Grapefruit juice, orange juice, and papaya nectar are rich in vitamin C. Apricot nectar and carrot juice have lots of beta carotene.Show sources Hide sources Kanadys WM. 2007.

Newborn screening tests: How to get more than your state requires,https://www.babycenter.com/0_newborn-screening-tests-how-to-get-more-than-your-state-requ_1454457.bc,"If your baby is born in the United States, someone will test your baby for a number of genetic disorders and health problems shortly after birth. The precise testing that your baby receives will depend on the state in which you live and the facility where you deliver. For example, if you give birth in Virginia, your newborn will be screened for nine genetic disorders; but if you deliver your baby across the border in West Virginia, your newborn will be tested for only four.If you're happy with the testing that your state does  and if you deliver in a hospital  then you don't have to do anything to get this testing; it will happen automatically. But if you want more than the minimum that your state requires, you'll have to do a little legwork.Finding out what your state requiresProbably the easiest way to find out what testing your state requires is to ask your doctor or midwife. But if you don't want to wait for your next appointment, visit the National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center Web site for state-specific newborn screening information and a link to your state's newborn screening program Web site.Health experts recommend moreAlthough most states require only a handful of tests, a panel of experts convened by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the March of Dimes recommends newborns be screened for 30 genetic disorders, including hypothyroidism, cystic fibrosis, and sickle cell anemia. All of the disorders can be detected through a simple blood test, and many can be treated relatively easily  by changing a baby's diet, for example, or by feeding a baby more frequently. Newborn care immediately after birthThe tests, care, and medications newborns receive in the first minutes of life.In addition to the genetic testing, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the March of Dimes, and the American Academy of Pediatrics also recommend that all newborns be tested for early hearing loss before leaving the hospital.Where to get additional testingGetting additional testing is easy  and cheap. If you'd like your baby to be tested for more disorders than your state law currently requires, discuss this with your doctor or midwife. See if you can make arrangements with a laboratory for supplemental newborn screening. The cost is quite low: For example, the Institute of Metabolic Disease at Baylor University in Texas will test your newborn for 30 genetic disorders for about $25. You can find a list of organizations that offer supplemental newborn screening at the National Newborn Screening and Genetics Resource Center's Web site.

Avoiding common pregnancy discomforts when you're on the road,https://www.babycenter.com/0_avoiding-common-pregnancy-discomforts-when-youre-on-the-road_6979.bc,"How can I relieve bloating, gas pain, and heartburn while traveling?When you're on the road, it can be hard to maintain a healthy diet and a regular eating schedule. Chances are you'll be eating out more, eating on the run, resorting to fatty fast-food meals, and eating foods you're not used to.Changes in time zones will shift your mealtimes. If you fly across country, you could find yourself eating supper at what would be midnight back home. As a result, travel can worsen the bloating, gas, and heartburn already common in pregnancy.If you've been having tummy trouble during your pregnancy, you're likely to have it while traveling, but you can take steps to lessen potential problems.Instead of eating three big meals, aim for several small meals throughout the day.Take your time eating and chew thoroughly. Don't gulp your drinks.Pack loose, comfortable clothing (nothing that's too tight around your waist or stomach).Advice for avoiding gas:Cut back on the foods that are most likely to cause gas. These include carbonated beverages, cabbage, cauliflower, brussels sprouts, broccoli, asparagus, leeks, onions, scallions, artichokes, dried fruit, pears, apples, honey, soda, fruit drinks, wheat, corn, potatoes, oat bran, beans, peas, and high-fat and fried foods.Advice for avoiding heartburn:Avoid foods and drinks that cause heartburn, such as alcohol (which you should avoid anyway during pregnancy); caffeine; chocolate; acidic foods like citrus fruits, tomatoes, mustard, and vinegar; processed meats; mint products; and spicy, highly seasoned, fried, or fatty foods.Don't eat dinner too close to your bedtime. Give yourself two to three hours to digest before lying down. And try sleeping with your upper body propped up with several pillows.Don't smoke  in addition to contributing to a host of serious health problems, smoking boosts stomach acidity. (Ideally, this is a habit you should break before getting pregnant. If you're still smoking and having trouble quitting, ask your caregiver for a referral to a smoking-cessation program.)An over-the-counter antacid that contains magnesium or calcium may ease discomfort, but check with your prenatal caregiver before taking one, because some brands are high in sodium.Pregnancy heartburn Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:00Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:00Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videos How can I relieve constipation?If you suffer from constipation before you go on a trip, traveling can make it worse. Sitting for long stretches, changing your diet and mealtimes, not having a restroom readily available when you need one, not drinking enough fluids  all these can wreak havoc on your bowels. Try these tips to relieve or avoid the problem:Bring high-fiber foods like bran cereal, whole-grain breads, fresh or dried fruit, and fresh vegetables to snack on.Drink plenty of water. Getting enough fluids helps keep your digestive system moving. Prune juice can be particularly helpful. The Institute of Medicine recommends that pregnant women have about 10 8-ounces cups of water or other beverages each day. (Drink more if it's warm out or you're exercising.) Another way to ensure proper hydration is to monitor your urine color  if it's dark yellow or cloudy, you need to drink more.Exercise. Take breaks to walk and stretch. At your destination, take advantage of hotel fitness centers and swimming pools or local facilities.Your bowels are most likely to be active after meals so try to leave time to use the bathroom after you eat and before you head out.Ask your healthcare provider about taking along an over-the-counter fiber supplement.Ask your provider if the iron in your prenatal vitamin could be the culprit. High doses of iron  more than 30 milligrams (mg)  can cause constipation or make it worse. As long as you're not anemic, you should be able to take a supplement that contains 30 mg or less of iron.Pregnancy constipation Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:03Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:03Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosHow can I avoid fatigue?It's normal to tire more easily when you're pregnant. Your body is working overtime to support your growing baby. The demands of traveling  along with jet lag from time zone changes and other disruptions to your schedule  will only add to your fatigue.While you can still enjoy many of your favorite vacation activities, you may need to slow your usual pace, keep your schedule light, and give up the idea of seeing everything. Keep your plans as simple as possible, and think quality rather than quantity.Take naps. An afternoon snooze is an especially good way to avoid exhaustion. At your destination, set aside time each day to lie down, close your eyes, and drift off. Even if you can't take a full-fledged nap, pausing periodically during the day to put your feet up can help.Try to spend time outside in the daylight to help reset your biological clock to the new time zone.Keep evening meals light and non-greasy to help ward off the gastrointestinal discomforts that can keep you up at night. Cut back on caffeine and make sure you're drinking enough water to stay well hydrated. To head off middle-of-the-night trips to the bathroom, though, avoid drinking anything two hours before bedtime.Take a warm bath before bed to help you unwind and sleep more soundly.Go to bed as close to your normal bedtime as you can, unless you've crossed at least three time zones. In that case, it's best to try to adjust your sleep schedule to local time to combat jet lag.Lying on your side with a pillow between your knees is usually the most comfortable sleeping position for pregnant women. Keeping your upper body slightly elevated can help counteract heartburn, too.Show sources Hide sources ACG. Undated. Belching, bloating and flatulence.

Sleep problem: Leg cramps wake you up at night,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sleep-problem-leg-cramps-wake-you-up-at-night_7552.bc,"Why it happensNo one really knows why women get more leg cramps when they're pregnant.It's possible that your leg muscles get tired from carrying around all of your extra weight. Or they may be responding to the pressure that your expanding uterus puts on the blood vessels that return blood from your legs to your heart and on the nerves that lead from your trunk to your legs.Leg cramps may start to bother you during your second trimester  and they may get worse as your pregnancy progresses and your belly grows. You'll probably notice leg cramps most at night, although they can occur during the day. Restless leg syndrome symptoms are also common at night in pregnant women.What you can do about itTry these tips for keeping leg cramps at bay:Avoid standing or sitting with your legs crossed for long periods of time.Stretch your calf muscles regularly during the day and several times before you go to bed.Wear comfortable shoes with plenty of support.Rotate your ankles and wiggle your toes when you sit, eat dinner, or watch television.Take a walk every day, unless your midwife or doctor has advised you not to exercise.Avoid getting too tired. Lie down on your left side to improve circulation to and from your legs.Stay hydrated during the day by drinking water regularly.Try a warm bath before bed to relax your muscles.There's some evidence that getting adequate potassium and magnesium can help prevent leg cramps, though not all studies show a benefit.Similarly, you may have heard that having leg cramps is a sign that you need more calcium, and that calcium supplements will relieve the problem. Though it's certainly important to get enough calcium, there's no good evidence that taking extra calcium will help prevent leg cramps during pregnancy. In fact, in one well-designed study, pregnant women taking calcium got no more relief from leg cramps than those taking a placebo.Check with your provider before taking any kind of supplement beyond your prenatal vitamin during pregnancy. Sleep positions during pregnancyLearn two easy ways to get comfortable and accommodate your growing belly during pregnancy.If you do get a cramp, immediately stretch your calf muscles: Straighten your leg, heel first, and gently flex your toes back toward your shins. It might hurt at first, but it will ease the spasm and the pain will gradually go away.You can try to relax the cramp by massaging the muscle or warming it with a hot water bottle. Getting out of bed and walking around for a few minutes may help, too.If your muscle pain is constant and not just an occasional cramp  or if you notice swelling or tenderness in your leg  call your healthcare provider. These may be signs of a blood clot, which requires immediate medical attention. Blood clots are rare, but your risk is higher during pregnancy.Show sources Hide sources MedlinePlus (ADAM). Undated.

Breastfeeding premature babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-premature-babies_8480.bc,"What do I need to know?Breastfeeding is great for all newborns, but it's even more important if your baby arrives early. That's because your body will automatically produce milk that's specially designed to nourish your premature baby, with extra calories, vitamins, and protein. What's more, the live cells in breast milk that protect babies from infection can be even more important for premature babies: Preemies face a higher risk of infection because their immune systems are particularly immature. You will find artificial formulas and supplements made just for preemies, but they can't provide the antibodies and other protective factors that are in your breast milk and are so beneficial to a fragile premature infant.Whether or not your baby is ready to nurse at your breast right away will depend on his gestational age and overall health. At many hospitals it's standard practice to start off feeding very premature babies expressed breast milk through a nasogastric (NG) tube (known as gavage). This is to make sure the baby gets as much nourishment as possible if he's too immature to suckle from breast or bottle.You'll work closely with the hospital staff overseeing your baby's care on a plan to feed your pumped breast milk to your baby. Many preemies simply aren't ready to start breastfeeding in the hospital right away, and won't be released until they've started to gain weight from breast- and/or bottle-feeding.Once your baby is able to start nursing at the breast, be prepared to nurse frequently, although preemies may not take in much milk at each feeding until they're closer to term. For this reason, you'll need to pump after feedings to keep up your milk production as well as have milk for any necessary supplementary feedings. You may need to use different breastfeeding holds for your preemie. Hospital staff, including lactation professionals, may be helpful when you start breastfeeding.Breastfeeding Problem SolverFind solutions to a variety of breastfeeding challenges, including nipple pain, low milk supply, and more. What challenges could I face?If your baby is too immature to breastfeed right after birth, your initial challenge will be to stimulate and maintain your milk supply. The most efficient and convenient way to do this is to use a hospital-grade pump with a double collection kit (a hospital nurse or lactation consultant will get one for you and show you how to use it). You'll also eventually want to rent one to use for the first several weeks at home, until you're sure your baby is feeding well at your breast.Once your baby is ready to move on to the breast, learning how to latch on and suck can be difficult. Most babies don't develop the suck-swallow-breathe reflex that's critical for feeding until about week 32 in the womb, eight weeks before they're considered full-term. It can also be challenging to figure out whether your baby is getting enough by breast alone if you're used to supplementing feedings.A common rule in taking care of preterm babies is to limit how much they cry, on the theory that crying wastes precious energy better devoted to growing. Of course, it's harder to care for a baby when you can't wait for him to cry out to say he's hungry or uncomfortable. You'll have to learn to anticipate your baby's hunger, which takes time.How can I solve these problems?You can start by tuning in to your baby's cues. To minimize crying and maximize intake, you must figure out when your baby wants to eat, and when he'll be ready for the next feeding. This isn't easy because premature babies tend to be quieter when asking for food than their full-term peers. Wakefulness may be the only clue that he's getting hungry, instead of the full-throated wail heard in most nurseries.You'll also want to continue to pump after you nurse to make sure you're keeping up your supply. You may want to hire a lactation consultant to help you check your baby's weight gain, or consider renting an electronic scale so you can weigh your baby before and after nursing sessions to see how much he's taking in.Aim for feeding your baby at least every three hours or so, about eight feedings every 24 hours. This schedule is flexible, and if he seems hungry only two hours after eating, by all means let him try again. It's also okay to wake him up to nurse. In fact, disturbing a nap may actually trigger the suckling instinct.The life of a preterm baby is little more than eating and sleeping, and when your baby's not eating, you need to think about how to get him to eat. This may mean, for example, unwrapping him, or even taking off his clothes to stimulate his need for comfort, and for suckling.Where can I get more help?La Leche League International (LLLI) is a great place to direct all your breastfeeding-related questions, and they'll probably be able to introduce you to other moms who are nursing premature children. You may want to hire a lactation consultant to help you through the early weeks. Doctors and nurses will certainly be able to answer a lot of your questions, but you may need more hands-on help. LLLI also has books and other resources for moms of preterm babies."
Low milk supply,https://www.babycenter.com/0_low-milk-supply_8487.bc,"What is low milk supply?Almost all mothers go through a period of questioning whether their milk supply is adequate, especially when they begin breastfeeding.Many women think their milk supply is low when it isn't. This can happen if you lose the feeling of fullness in your breasts or if milk stops leaking from your nipples. But these are actually signs that your body has adjusted to your baby's feeding requirements. A baby going through a growth spurt may also want more milk than usual, and his more frequent feedings may leave your breasts less full than they have been.In most cases, either the baby is getting plenty of milk or the mom's low supply can be corrected. In some cases, though, a low milk supply can put a baby at risk for malnutrition. So it's important to get it checked out.What causes low milk supply?A mother's milk supply may diminish temporarily if she's not feeding her baby often enough because of nipple pain, a lethargic nurser, or a poor latch-on technique. An illness or birth control pills that contain estrogen can also affect milk production. For a few women, a biological or physical condition such as a hormonal disorder or breast surgery causes their milk supply to be low.For most women, though, the real problem is delivery, not production. They produce plenty of milk, but for some reason, such as an incorrect latch-on technique, the baby isn't getting enough.Breastfeeding Problem SolverFind solutions to a variety of breastfeeding challenges, including nipple pain, low milk supply, and more.How can I tell if my baby's getting enough milk?Here are the ways you'll know:Your baby gains an ounce a day in the first three months of life and half an ounce a day from age 3 to 6 months. (Newborns will typically lose some of their birth weight in the first few days before gaining it back.) Your baby should be back to his birth weight by ten to 14 days after birth. Weight gain is the best evidence that your baby's getting enough milk.In the first month, your baby has at least three stools a day and they lighten to a yellowy-mustard color by the fifth day after birth. After the first month, the stools become less frequent. Some babies will even go a day or two between stools.Your baby nurses frequently (every two to three hours), for a total of at least eight feedings a day.You hear him swallow and you sometimes notice milk in the corners of his mouth.Your baby appears healthy and active.Your baby wets seven or eight cloth diapers a day, or five to six disposables. Disposable diapers are more absorbent, making it hard to tell when one is wet. If you're not sure, take one off and compare its weight to a dry disposable. A wet one will feel slightly heavier.(Note: Wet diapers alone are not enough to determine whether your baby's getting enough milk: A dehydrated baby can still wet a diaper. Stools and weight gain are the best ways to tell how your baby's doing.)How can I boost my milk supply?If you're not producing as much milk as you (and your baby) would like, try the following:See a lactation professional. She can weigh your baby and give you tips on how to boost your milk supply.Feed your baby often. Frequent nursing sessions stimulate your body to produce more milk. Be sure to offer both breasts at each feeding.Get the best latch-on possible. A lactation consultant can help you with proper positioning at the breast.When your baby's sucking and swallowing pattern slows down, use breast compression to increase milk flow to your baby and to completely drain the breast. When your milk flow with compression seems to be slowing, switch sides and repeat. Keep switching back and forth between breasts until your baby is satisfied or stops swallowing.* Stimulate your body to produce more milk by adding a pumping session between nursings. Store any milk you pump to give your baby at future nursings, if needed, until your milk supply increases.* Don't supplement your baby's feedings with any solid food or formula, unless you and your caregiver decide that your baby needs supplemental nourishment for medical reasons.* Avoid the use of a pacifier. Instead, encourage your baby to comfort himself at the breast  his sucking will stimulate your milk production.A sleepy baby may need to be awakened and encouraged to nurse more vigorously (thus stimulating your glands to produce more milk). To keep him awake and interested, try switching sides frequently, alternating positions, or even undressing him. Some mothers play with their baby's feet during feedings to keep them awake.Mothers who determine that their milk output is actually low may want to have their thyroid level checked. A low thyroid level is known to reduce milk supply.If you're not sure your baby is sucking well, or are still concerned about your milk supply, don't hesitate to call on a lactation consultant for help.* Consider herbs that are reputed to increase milk production (these are called galactogogues). You'll want to check with a reputable herbalist or knowledgeable healthcare provider about the safety of specific herbs during nursing. You may also want to check our breast milk interactions chart.If you've tried remedies such as these to no avail, your doctor or lactation consultant may recommend medication to increase your milk production and closely follow your progress and condition while you're taking it.How will a low milk supply affect my baby?If your baby regularly needs more milk than he gets, he may be diagnosed with failure to gain weight, a condition that can inhibit physical and mental development. Call your child's doctor and schedule a checkup right away if he's not gaining weight or is losing weight. Improved breastfeeding techniques often help, but in some cases slow weight gain indicates a serious health concern.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a. Making sure your baby is getting enough milk.

Breastfeeding after breast reduction surgery,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-after-breast-reduction-surgery_8691.bc,"ConditionBreast reduction surgeryThe potential problemSurgical reduction of the breasts can damage nerves and milk-producing ducts and glands, making breastfeeding difficult.Can I breastfeed?Probably. If your nipple and areola are still attached to the breast tissue beneath them, there's a good chance you'll be able to nurse. However, if the nipple was removed and then placed on a reconstructed breast, damage to the nerves, milk ducts, and breast tissue may limit your milk flow and diminish sensation in your nipples. Nerves are vital to breastfeeding because they trigger the release of prolactin and oxytocin, two hormones that affect milk production and letdown.In general, the longer it's been since the surgery, the more sensation you're likely to have in your nipple and areola and the more milk you're likely to produce.SolutionYou won't know exactly how your milk supply is affected until you start trying to nurse. If you still have feeling in the nipple, you have a much better chance of having a full supply. Ask a lactation expert for guidance and support.Also let your baby's doctor know about your surgery. She'll need to keep a close eye on your baby's weight gain to make sure he's getting enough to eat. (Learn how to tell if your baby's getting enough milk.)On the third day postpartum, you can try pumping for five minutes on each breast after every nursing session to help build your milk supply. It's likely that you'll need to use a fully automated pump that pumps both breasts at once to stimulate your letdown reflex.If you're able to produce only part of the milk your baby needs, you'll need to supplement with banked breast milk or formula.In the first few weeks postpartum, you might consider using a supplemental nursing system (SNS). The device consists of a plastic pouch to hold breast milk or formula attached to thin, flexible tubes that run down the breasts to each nipple. Since your baby takes both nipple and tube into his mouth when he suckles, he benefits from all the breast milk that's available while stimulating your breasts to produce more.If you're thinking about having your breasts reduced but want to be able to nurse your babies, postpone surgery until after you've weaned your last child. This is a good idea anyway because your breasts can change so much when you're pregnant and nursing."
Feeding problems: Refusing to eat,https://www.babycenter.com/0_feeding-problems-refusing-to-eat_9203.bc,"The problemOne of the first skills your toddler masters is feeding herself. Though she can't control much in her life right now, she can definitely control what she puts in her mouth.So it's no surprise when she's very opinionated about what she will  and won't  eat. She may eat only one or two preferred foods for weeks, then suddenly change her mind and want something completely different. Don't worry  this is typical toddler behavior.What you can doYour child needs some encouragement and structure from you when it comes to mealtimes (such as regular meals and healthy choices), but not much more. William Sears, noted pediatrician and author of 23 books on childcare, says whether and how much your child eats should ultimately be up to her. ""Your child may eat well one day and eat practically nothing the next,"" says Dr. Sears, who co-authored The Family Nutrition Book with his wife, Martha.Rather than get hung up on the fact that your child has refused everything you put in front of her today, consider what she's eaten over the course of one week. Parents are often surprised to find that their child's food intake balances out. Something must be fueling all that energy!Rest assured: As long as your child is growing and gaining weight accordingly, you can be confident that your toddler is getting enough to eat. If you're concerned, ask your child's doctor to go over your child's growth chart. You may be relieved to find out you dont have anything to worry about!Here are a few tips to help get through those bumpy patches:Offer a variety of healthy food choices and let your toddler feed herself. This way she gets to exercise a little independence.Don't threaten her or bargain with her. ""One more bite and you get a cookie,"" or, ""No story time if you don't eat your peas,"" makes mealtime into a power struggle. If you want to raise a healthy eater, keep mealtimes positive, and don't use sweets as a reward.Have meals as a family whenever possible. When your toddler sees you or her siblings eating healthy food, she's more likely to want to follow along.Don't take something off the menu if she doesn't like it. Kids are slow to accept new tastes and textures, so if she spits out green beans the first time, try making them again the following week. She may surprise you and decide they're her new favorite food. (Though you may have to offer a new food many times before she's willing to make it a regular part of her diet.)Don't forget to consider how much she drinks in the food equation, too. Drinking too much milk or juice can dampen an appetite, so you may want to serve milk between meals and limit juice to no more than 1/2 to 3/4 cup a day. Don't offer juice to infants younger than 1. Milk and 100 percent juice can supply vital nutrients (though too much juice means too much sugar, and fruit juice lacks the fiber and some nutrients found in fruit).And don't let her fill up on sweets and junk food  her growing body needs the nutrients supplied by a healthy diet, not empty calories.Extra vitaminsThe American Academy of Pediatrics says that a daily multivitamin isn't usually necessary if your toddler eats a variety of food. But if she doesn't eat much meat or fish, iron-fortified cereal, or iron-rich dark green vegetables, she may need an iron supplement. The best way to know whether your child needs a daily multivitamin  and what kind to give her  is to check with her doctor.And whether or not your doctor recommends a multivitamin, your child will still need some extra vitamin D. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus, which build bones. Sunscreen prevents sunlight from synthesizing vitamin D, and it's difficult to get this essential nutrient from milk alone, so doctors recommend giving children 400 international units (IUs) of vitamin D daily.Most multivitamins contain vitamin D. If your doctor recommends a multivitamin, your child will usually not need an extra vitamin D supplement.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2013a. Dietary supplements for toddlers.

Dehydration in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_dehydration-in-babies_11527.bc,"What is dehydration?If your baby's dehydrated, it means that she doesn't have as much fluid in her body as she needs. Babies and children are more prone to dehydration than adults, and it can happen if your baby takes in less fluid than she loses through vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or sweating. Dehydration can be mild and easily corrected, moderate, or severe and life threatening.How can I tell if my baby is dehydrated?Any of these signs could indicate that your baby is dehydrated or is becoming dehydrated:More than six hours without a wet diaperUrine that looks darker and smells stronger than usualLethargyA dry, parched mouth and lipsNo tears while cryingThese signs indicate that your baby may be seriously dehydrated:Sunken eyesHands and feet that feel cold and look splotchyExcessive sleepiness or fussinessSunken fontanels (the soft spots on your baby's head)Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.What should I do if my baby shows signs of dehydration?Babies can quickly become dangerously dehydrated, so if you think your baby shows signs of serious dehydration, take him to the emergency room immediately. He may need to receive liquids through an intravenous (IV) tube until he's rehydrated.Otherwise, give your baby's doctor a call for advice. She may want to see him to make sure he's okay. If she decides that your baby is mildly dehydrated, she may instruct you to give him more fluids. If your baby is younger than 3 months, she will probably suggest sticking with breast milk or formula but offering them more frequently than usual.If your baby is 3 months or older, the doctor may recommend a special liquid  in addition to breast milk or formula  to replenish the water and salts (electrolytes) that his body has lost. Electrolyte liquids are available in most pharmacies. Pedialyte, Infalyte, and ReVital are some of the name-brand products. Ask your pharmacist about generic brands, too.Your baby's doctor can give you instructions for using electrolyte liquids, based on your baby's weight and age, but a general guideline for the amount of total solution he should ingest over the course of three or four hours is 5 teaspoons (25 mL or cc) per pound of your baby's weight. So, for example, if your baby weighs 15 pounds, this would equal 75 teaspoons (375 mL or cc), or about 1 1/2 cups.How can I prevent dehydration?Make sure your baby is drinking plenty of fluids, especially on very hot days and when she's ill. Continue to breastfeed or bottle-feed her and, if she's 6 months or older, you can supplement with a little water  about 4 ounces per day until she's eating solid foods, at which point you can increase the amount. If your baby is younger than 6 months and you're concerned about dehydration, talk with her doctor about giving her small amounts of water.Don't give your baby carbonated sodas, as they're terrible for her teeth and health. If your baby is drinking juice, don't increase the amount of juice she drinks in a day, but you might try diluting it with water. If she's drinking 3 or 4 ounces of juice a day, for example, you could dilute this to 6 or 8 ounces of liquid. (The American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP] recommends limiting your baby's daily juice intake to 4 to 6 ounces per day.)Be especially alert to symptoms of dehydration under these circumstances:Fever. Offer your baby plenty of liquids whenever she has a fever. If she seems to be having trouble swallowing, ask her doctor whether you can give her a pain medication such as children's acetaminophen or (if she's 6 months or older) ibuprofen, to help with the discomfort. (Never give a child aspirin, which is associated with a rare but serious condition called Reye's syndrome.)Overheating. Give your baby more fluids than usual during hot weather. Too much activity on a hot day or just sitting in a stuffy, sweltering room can lead to sweating and fluid loss.Diarrhea. If your baby has an intestinal illness, especially acute gastroenteritis, she'll lose fluid through diarrhea and vomiting. Don't give her fruit juice, which may just make the situation worse, and don't give her over-the-counter diarrhea medicine unless her doctor recommends it.Just encourage your baby to drink extra breast milk or formula, and supplement with a little water once she's 6 months or older. If your baby is 3 months or older and you think she may be becoming dehydrated, you can give her an electrolyte drink as well.By the way, if your baby has dehydration caused by diarrhea, her stools will be loose. If fluid loss from vomiting or another source causes dehydration, she'll have fewer and smaller bowel movements.Vomiting. Viruses and intestinal infections can lead to vomiting. If your baby is having trouble keeping liquids down, she can easily become dehydrated.Try giving her very small amounts of fluid (primarily breast milk or formula as well as a little water if she's 6 months or older) frequently. Electrolyte liquids are helpful for babies 3 months or older who have been vomiting. Start by giving her slow, frequent sips when her tummy settles down  about 1 teaspoon (5 mL or cc) every 10 minutes for a couple of hours. Then, if all goes well, you can increase the amount to 2 teaspoons (10 mL or cc) every five minutes.Refuses to drink. A sore throat or ailment such as hand, foot, and mouth disease can cause so much pain that a baby sometimes stops drinking. Ask your doctor about giving your baby children's acetaminophen or ibuprofen (if she's 6 months or older) to ease the discomfort, and then offer her breast milk or formula and water, frequently and in small quantities.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012.

Helping a child who's underweight,https://www.babycenter.com/0_helping-a-child-whos-underweight_64368.bc,"How can I tell if my preschooler is too skinny?There are several factors to take into consideration when evaluating your child's weight. Has he always been thin? Are both of his parents very thin? A child who has a genetic tendency to be thin is in a different boat than a child who has always been normal to hefty and who has recently stopped gaining  or started losing  weight. Even if your child has just recently thinned out, though, there may be nothing to worry about.""Keep in mind that a child's weight is dynamic and changes with growth,"" says Stephen R. Daniels, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition.When an increase in height precedes a gain in weight, Daniels explains, your child may appear underweight for a while, until his weight gain catches up. It's also possible, though, for your child's weight gain to eventually outstrip his gain in height, resulting in his becoming overweight. Doctors are very concerned that many children are becoming overweight as they grow older, Daniels says, and some of those children started out as underweight.The best way to determine whether your child is underweight  and to find out what to do about it  is to make an appointment with his doctor so she can help you evaluate his weight and his diet. How will the doctor determine whether my child is underweight?Your child's doctor will take into consideration the factors mentioned above  how much his parents weigh and how long he's been thin. She'll also evaluate your child's eating habits and his overall health. She'll probably ask if your child has had any medical problems that may have contributed to weight loss, like chronic diarrhea or vomiting.The doctor will measure your child's height and weight and plot these numbers on a growth chart. Doctors today are using a new series of growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that take into consideration a child's body mass index, or BMI, which considers weight together with height to help determine whether they are proportional. The BMI is a better indicator of body composition than a weight measurement alone. While an adult's BMI is calculated with a straight formula of height and weight, the formula to determine a child's BMI takes into consideration gender and age as well, to allow for the fact that body composition changes as a child gets older.If your child's BMI falls below the 5th percentile, he's considered underweight. The doctor will ask you questions about your child's diet, so she can pinpoint any major deficiencies. She may have you refer to the Food Guide Pyramid, so you can determine which food groups your child may not be getting enough of. She'll do a physical examination and may run laboratory tests to determine if there's an underlying medical cause, especially if your child seems to be eating well but not gaining weight. How can I help my child gain weight?Assuming your child has no underlying medical concerns, the idea will be to get him to take in more calories. For some children, simply adding foods that are ""heart-healthy"" sources of fat such as avocados, nuts, and vegetable oils  provides enough additional calories to meet the demands of growth. Try to plan healthy, calorie-dense meals and snacks for your child so he gets enough to eat.Whatever you do, don't feed your child ""junk food"" in an effort to promote weight gain, warns Daniels. Eating habits are ingrained early in life, and they may be difficult to change once they become established.Make mealtimes pleasant and unrushed. Sit down together whenever you can and enjoy your food and time together. Involve your child in meal planning, shopping (enlist his help picking out fruit at the market and bread at the bakery, for example), and food preparation, to encourage his interest in food and eating. Also, don't let your child get so wrapped up doing something that he skips meals. He needs to be eating frequently if you want him to gain weight.Here is a list of healthy high-calorie foods that you might offer your child:Dairy: Whole milk, cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, creamed soups, puddingProtein: Eggs, peanut butter, bean soups, nutsCarbohydrates: Bread, macaroni and cheese, pasta, French toast, pancakes, mashed potatoes, hot cerealIf your child is a picky eater and refuses to add new foods to his diet, his doctor may recommend a high-calorie supplement drink. These supplements taste like milkshakes and provide additional vitamins and minerals that your child may be missing out on.Make sure, though, that your child isn't filling up on beverages  like juices or even milk  so that he's not hungry for meals. Try to limit juice to no more than one cup a day and milk to no more than two cups a day.While you'll be eager to check on his progress, don't start subjecting your child to regular weigh-ins at home, because they may make him anxious and self-conscious about his weight. However, your doctor may want to see your child once a month to monitor his progress. Treat these visits like any other to the doctor, and don't make a big deal about the weigh-in process.What if my child doesn't start gaining weight?If your child is getting enough calories but still does not seem to be gaining weight appropriately, continue to work with his doctor to discover any underlying conditions. On the other hand, if your child is refusing to eat, there may be a psychological reason that you'll want to discuss with a child therapist. Your child's doctor can provide a referral.Chances are good, though, that with some patience and some conscientious meal and snack plans, your child will strike a good height/weight balance."
My breastfeeding story: I couldn't breastfeed my baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-i-couldnt-breastfeed-my-baby_10405876.bc,"Name: CrystalLives in: Jersey City, New JerseyBreastfeeding experience: Stressful, disappointing, and upsettingMain challenges: Lactation failure; took time to diagnose the problem; felt shamed by lactation consultantsBreastfed for: Tried for 5 weeks before finally giving upMy storyWhen I gave birth to Nikka four years ago I couldn't breastfeed her  not that I didn't try. I followed the nurse's instructions and gave her my breast right after she was born. I didn't see any milk but she was very sleepy, and I hoped she was at least getting colostrum.After three days with no real improvement, I became concerned. I checked in with the hospital's lactation consultant who squeezed some colostrum from my breast and told me to stop worrying, my milk would come in soon.The next day when I still had no milk, I began giving Nikka formula because she was crying and clearly very hungry. I kept trying to nurse her as well but felt a growing panic as the days wore on and my breast milk failed to arrive.I also felt tremendous guilt. One consultant left me with reading materials that said, ""If you don't breastfeed your baby, she won't be as smart as she could have been.""None of the experts I spoke to could tell me why my milk hadn't come in. My husband and I scoured the Internet and read breastfeeding books. We could only surmise that I had some kind of low milk supply problem.On day seven I took my daughter to her first pediatric visit. Her wonderful doctor was the first person to take me seriously and try to help. She asked about other known causes of low supply, including whether I'd lost a lot of blood during childbirth.When these were ruled out, she recommended trying the herbal supplement fenugreek. After taking the capsules for three days, I was able to produce about an ounce of milk at each pumping. This was not nearly enough to feed my daughter, who was drinking several ounces of formula at each feeding. But at least I could bottle-feed this small amount of my breast milk to her.After that I saw two lactation consultants who recommended I rent a hospital-grade breast pump. I pumped every three hours for two weeks  something that was supposed to teach my body to start producing more milk  but never managed to increase my supply.In the meantime, the consultants showed me how to use slow-flow bottle nipples so my baby wouldn't get used to a fast flow from the bottle and then reject my breast. One also gave me a device called the Supplemental Nursing System, which allowed my baby to feed at my breast and practice nursing while a tiny tube inserted in the side of her mouth simultaneously supplied formula.Finally, after three agonizing weeks, I was referred to Mona Gabbay, a doctor who specializes in helping mothers and babies breastfeed. She suspected I had a low level of prolactin (the hormone that stimulates milk production), and a blood test confirmed her suspicions.I'm sorry I didn't find this out earlier. Knowing that I might not be able to produce milk  no matter how hard I tried  would have alleviated the panic and trauma I experienced. Instead I spent five weeks strapped to a breast pump rather than cuddling with my baby because everybody told me to just try harder.Too many of the experts I turned to seemed to believe that mothers who use formula are lazy and even cruel, which made my situation even more painful. My daughter not only survived because of formula, she thrived. She's now a healthy, active, and very bright 4-year-old.My biggest lesson learnedDo not feel guilty for being unable to breastfeed. The human body doesn't always work the way it's supposed to and there really is nothing wrong with giving your baby formula. If you're having problems, find a doctor who specializes in breastfeeding so that all the medical reasons for lactation failure can be investigated.

Iron-deficiency anemia: What do I need to know before I get pregnant?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-deficiency-anemia-what-do-i-need-to-know-before-i-get-p_10414719.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI have iron-deficiency anemia. Do I need to see my healthcare provider before I get pregnant?Yes. If you have iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) and are planning to get pregnant, visit your healthcare provider for a preconception checkup. A preconception checkup gives you the chance to discuss your condition and have a blood test to determine how severe your anemia is. (And if you're unsure about the type of anemia you have, your provider can go over your medical history to see if it might be caused by something other than iron deficiency.)Seeing your provider before you get pregnant also ensures that your anemia is managed appropriately. In most cases, mild anemia doesn't pose a problem during pregnancy if it's caught and treated early. But if your anemia is severe, your provider may refer you to a specialist.Why is iron important during pregnancy?Iron is essential for making hemoglobin. Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells that carries oxygen around your body to other cells. Iron requirements go up significantly when you're pregnant because extra iron is needed for the placenta and growing baby.Your blood volume increases by about 50 percent during pregnancy  also increasing your need for iron. It's important that your healthcare provider knows you have anemia because it's possible you need more iron than the average pregnant woman.What causes iron-deficiency anemia?It's not unusual to develop anemia during pregnancy because of the need for more iron. But if you have anemia before you get pregnant, the most common reasons include:Having heavy periodsNot eating enough iron-rich foods. The recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for American women ages 19 to 50 is 18 milligrams (mg) of iron a day  and about 33 mg daily if you're a vegetarian. The typical diet supplies approximately 15 mg of iron per day.Not eating enough foods that help your body absorb ironEating too many foods that prevent the body from absorbing as much iron, such as dairy products and soy-based foodsDrinking lots of coffee or teaBeing unable to absorb iron properly. This could be due to taking certain medications, or having a condition that affects the body's ability to absorb nutrients, such as celiac disease or Crohn's disease.Previously losing a lot of blood when giving birthHaving a very short gap between pregnancies. If you're planning to have another baby, wait at least 18 months before conceiving again.Should I take a vitamin supplement?Yes. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) recommends that all women take prenatal vitamins when trying to get pregnant, and women with IDA take supplemental iron in addition to their prenatal vitamin.What else can I do to prepare for pregnancy?Try to eat plenty of iron-rich foods, such as beef, shrimp, beans, lentils, and enriched breakfast cereals.Eat iron-rich foods at the same time as foods that enhance iron absorption, like orange juice, strawberries, broccoli, and peppers.Try not to eat foods that prevent iron absorption at the same time you eat iron-rich foods. Key culprits are dairy products, soy products, coffee, and tea.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014.

Childproofing your bathroom,https://www.babycenter.com/0_childproofing-your-bathroom_402.bc,"Like the kitchen, the bathroom can be one of the more hazardous rooms in your home for your baby. The following tips will help keep your baby safe and out of mischief:Make sure your baby doesn't find his way into the bathroom unsupervised by installing a hook-and-eye lock high on the outside of the door or by placing a childproof cover over the doorknob.Remember to keep the toilet lid down, and install a toilet lock to prevent your baby from lifting the lid. Small children are curious, uncoordinated, and extremely top-heavy. If your baby leans over to peer into the toilet bowl, he could easily lose his balance, fall in headfirst, and drown in as little as an inch of water.Put razors, scissors, nail clippers, tweezers, and other sharp utensils in a locked cabinet or high up in a linen closet well out of your baby's reach.Unplug your blow-dryer, curling iron, and any other appliances that create heat, and put them away after each use to prevent burns.Keep all cosmetics and medications  including prescription drugs, antacids, aspirin, and mouthwash (which contains more alcohol than wine does)  in a high cabinet secured with a child-safety lock. Even medications that have safety caps, which are only child-resistant and not childproof, need to be placed out of reach.Treat all vitamins and other supplements with the same caution you'd use with medications, storing them in a high locked cabinet. Iron pills and multivitamins containing iron are poisonous to young children. Minerals, herbal remedies, and other supplements are hazardous, too.Don't keep anything plugged in near the sink or bathtub. Water conducts electricity, so if a hair dryer fell into the tub while you were giving your baby a bath, it could electrocute you both. To be extra safe, make sure all electrical outlets near the sink or tub are protected by a ground-fault circuit interrupter (GFCI), an inexpensive device that senses a change in the current and quickly stops the flow of electricity. GFCIs are standard in most new homes to comply with construction codes, but if you have an older home, an electrician may need to replace the bathroom outlets.Set your hot water heater no higher than 120 degrees Fahrenheit (49 degrees Celsius). A lower water temperature helps ensure safe bathing by reducing the chance of scalding (it takes just three seconds for a child to get a serious burn). You can also install an anti-scalding device on your faucets.Place a nonslip rubber mat in the bathtub and a nonslip bath mat on the floor next to the tub to prevent falls.Put a soft plastic or rubber guard over the tub spout to protect your baby from accidentally bumping his head.Never leave your baby alone in the bathtub, not even for a moment. If the doorbell rings, scoop him up in a towel and take him with you. Bring your cell phone or a cordless phone into the bathroom if you feel you can't miss a call.Teach your baby to stay seated in the tub at all times. If he's the active type, you may have to repeat this message many times before it sticks, but his safety makes the effort worth it."
Chromium in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_chromium-in-your-pregnancy-diet_663.bc,"Why you need chromium during pregnancyChromium is a mineral that helps your body break down and store fats, carbohydrates, and protein. It also works with the hormone insulin to maintain a normal level of glucose in your body. This is especially important if you're diabetic or become diabetic during pregnancy (gestational diabetes).Chromium (along with insulin) also promotes the building of proteins in your developing baby's growing tissues.How much chromium you needPregnant women ages 19 to 50: 30 micrograms (mcg) a day (29 mcg if you're 18 or younger)Breastfeeding women: 45 mcg a day (44 mcg if you're 18 or younger)Nonpregnant women ages 19 to 50: 25 mcg per dayYou don't have to get the recommended amount of chromium every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Food sources of chromiumBrewer's yeast is a concentrated source of chromium, containing as much as 60 mcg per tablespoon. Other good sources include:1/2 cup broccoli: 11 mcg3 ounces turkey or ham (processed): 10.4 mcg1 cup grape juice: 7.5 mcgone waffle (about 2.5 ounces): 6.7 mcgone whole wheat English muffin: 3.6 mcg1 cup mashed potatoes: 2.7 mcgone bagel: 2.5 mcg1 cup orange juice: 2.2 mcg3 ounces beef: 2.0 mcg3 ounces turkey breast: 1.7 mcgone medium apple, with peel: 1.4 mcg1/2 cup green beans: 1.1 mcgone medium banana: 1.0 mcgDo you need a supplement?You don't need  and shouldn't take  chromium supplements in addition to the amount that's included in your prenatal vitamin. Although pregnant women are at higher risk of a chromium deficiency, some forms of the mineral may be unsafe in large amounts during pregnancy.You can meet your needs by including chromium-rich foods in your diet such as poultry, fish, meats, eggs, and bran cereal.If you're concerned that you may have a chromium deficiency, talk with your healthcare provider.Show sources Hide sources IOM. 2010.

Iodine in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iodine-in-your-pregnancy-diet_667.bc,"Why you need iodine during pregnancyIodine is essential to the development of your baby's brain and nervous system. It also regulates your baby's metabolism (the rate at which the body uses energy). Iodine plays an important role in regulating your thyroid gland. A lack of iodine during pregnancy has been linked with an increased risk of miscarriage,preterm delivery, and stillbirth.How much iodine you needPregnant women: 220 micrograms (mcg) per dayBreastfeeding women: 290 mcg per dayNonpregnant women: 150 mcg per dayYou don't have to get the recommended amount of iodine every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Food sources of iodineIodine is found indairy products, eggs, vegetables, seafood, and brewer's yeast. (The amount of iodine in many types of food varies according to the amount of iodine in the area's soil or water.)Good food sources of iodine include:1 cup milk: 99 mcg3 ounces cod: 99 mcg1 gram iodized salt (about 1/8 teaspoon): 77 mcgone medium baked potato with skin: 60 mcg3 ounces shrimp: 35 mcgtwo fish sticks: 35 mcg3 ounces turkey breast, baked: 34 mcg1/2 cup cooked navy beans: 32 mcg3 ounces tuna, canned in oil: 17 mcgone large egg, hard boiled: 12 mcg(Note: Sea vegetables contain large amounts of iodine  sometimes even too much for regular consumption. Just one-quarter of an ounce of dried seaweed can contain more than 4,500 mcg of iodine, which is more than four times the tolerable upper intake level. The maximum amount considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine is 1,100 mcg per day.)Should you take an iodine supplement?Prenatal vitaminsdon't contain a reliable amount of iodine, but you probably still won't need to take a supplement because it's easy to meet your requirement with food.In the United States, about half of all table salt is enriched with iodine to prevent iodine deficiencies. Read the label to make sure. Also check the amount because it can vary widely. (Sea salt doesn't always contain iodine, and the salt in processed food is rarely iodized.)In general, Americans get more than enough salt in their diets: The Centers for Disease Control estimates that the average American gets about 48 percent more salt than recommended. Still, you might want to tally your iodine intake for a day to make sure you're getting enough.The signs of an iodine deficiencyIodine deficiencies are uncommon in the United States, but worldwide, iodine deficiencies are the single most important cause of preventable intellectual disability and brain damage.Signs of thyroid problems from a lack of iodine include an enlarged thyroid gland, fatigue, weakness, depression, intolerance to cold, and weight gain.

Deficiencies are most common in developing countries where people's diets consist mainly of white rice. Thiamin is contained in the outer coating of rice, which is usually removed in processing. (That's why you'll often see white rice that's enriched with thiamin.) In industrialized countries, alcoholism is the main cause of thiamin deficiency. Alcohol makes it hard for the body to absorb thiamin.What are the signs of a thiamin deficiency?Early signs include weakness, nausea, and fatigue. Severe deficiency, also called beriberi, causes difficulty walking, loss of feeling in hands and feet, loss of muscle function or paralysis of the lower legs, mental confusion, speech difficulties, increased heart rate, and shortness of breath with activity.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014.

If you're not a big breakfast eater, just drink a glass of milk.When you need a midafternoon boost, treat yourself to a decaf latte, hot chocolate, or cup of steamed milk. If you make hot chocolate with a powdered mix, use milk instead of water to boost the calcium content. (Some brands don't contain a significant amount of milk.)Use evaporated milk, which has double the calcium of regular milk, in cooked dishes like mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, cheese sauces and fruit smoothies, puddings, and custards.Make a yogurt dip for fresh vegetables.Top casseroles and soups with shredded cheese.Note: To avoid the bacterial infection listeriosis, stay away from unpasteurized milk and all foods made with it, such as soft cheeses like feta, Brie, Camembert, and blue-veined cheese.Can I eat dairy products even if I'm lactose intolerant?Even if you're lactose intolerant, you probably don't need to give up all dairy products. Research shows that most people who have trouble digesting lactose (the sugar in milk) can tolerate at least 1 cup of milk at mealtimes.Here are five ways to include dairy in your diet if you're lactose intolerant. (Be sure to check out this list of othergood sources of calcium.)Drink lactose-reduced milk or add over-the-counter enzyme drops (which help break down the lactose) to your milk. You can also take enzyme supplements (lactase) to help you digest the lactose more easily. (Be sure to check with your doctor or midwife before taking lactase or any other supplements.)Divide it up. Have 1/2 cup of milk (especially whole or 2 percent) four times a day with meals or snacks. The fat in the milk slows down digestion, making the lactose easier to digest.Drink milk with food. It's easier to digest when mixed with other foods, especially high-fiber foods.Choose low-fat or hard, aged cheese. More than half the lactose is removed from low-fat cheese during processing. Hard, aged cheeses have the lowest lactose content.Eat yogurt. This can be a great alternative to milk. Yogurt also contains active cultures, which are beneficial bacteria that help you digest lactose.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015. Nutrition during pregnancy.

How to buy baby formula,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-buy-baby-formula_1334669.bc,"I'm bottle-feeding my baby. Which formula is best?It's easy to feel overwhelmed in the formula aisle. Choosing the right nourishment for your baby is a pretty weighty decision, and there are lots of options.When choosing formula, consider the form it comes in, the type of protein and carbohydrate it provides, and what other ingredients are included. In the end, you'll be able to choose the formula that is best for your baby and your family's lifestyle.What are the different forms of formula?Formulas come in three forms: Ready-to-use, liquid concentrate, and powdered.Ready-to-use formula is undoubtedly the most convenient  no mixing or measuring required, just open and serve. It's the kind of formula that hospitals often give to newborns. It's hygienic and especially helpful when you don't know whether you'll have access to safe water.The convenience of ready-to-use formula comes at a price  this kind costs about 20 percent more per ounce than powdered formula. The containers also take up more storage space in your cupboard and more space in the landfill (unless you can recycle the containers).Once opened, ready-to-use formula has a short lifespan  it must be used within 48 hours. Also, because liquid formula is often darker than powdered formula, many moms complain that it's more likely to stain clothes.Liquid concentrate formula requires mixing equal parts of water and formula. Compared to ready-to-use formula, concentrate is less expensive and takes up less storage space. Compared to powdered formula, it's a little easier to prepare but more expensive.Powdered formula is the most economical and the most environmentally friendly formula option. It takes up the least amount of space in transport, in your pantry, and in your trash can.Powdered formula takes more time to prepare than other types of formula, and you must follow the directions exactly, but it has a one-month shelf life after the container has been opened. As with liquid concentrate formula, you can mix up just the right amount  as much or as little as you want  whenever you need it. This is especially helpful if you're a breastfeeding mom who may only need a supplemental bottle occasionally. What are the different types of formula?There's a formula to suit every baby's needs. But it's best to stick with one type and resist the urge to switch, even if your baby seems like he's not digesting the formula well at first.Common problems  like spitting up, gas, and colic  are usually unrelated to your baby's diet. Most of the time, these problems have to do with your baby's immature gastrointestinal tract, not what he's eating.So try out a particular type of formula for at least a couple weeks. After that, if your baby's still having trouble, talk to his doctor about switching.Cow's-milk-based formula: Most formula available today has cow's milk as the main ingredient. The overwhelming majority of formula-fed and formula-supplemented babies do best with this type of formula because it has just the right balance of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. The milk protein in formula is significantly altered to make it easier to digest. Your baby won't be able to digest regular cow's milk until after his first birthday.Partially and extensively hydrolyzed formulas: In these formulas, the protein is broken down into small parts (partially hydrolyzed) or even smaller parts (extensively hydrolyzed) that are easier for your baby to digest than larger protein molecules. Your baby may need a hydrolyzed formula if he has a milk protein allergy or trouble absorbing nutrients (a common problem for preemies). The doctor may also suggest trying a hydrolyzed formula if your baby has a skin condition such as eczema.Soy-based formula: These formulas are made with a plant protein that, like the protein in cow's milk, is modified for easy digestion. Although soy-based formulas are a good option for vegan families, there are only a few medical reasons for using them. These include:Transient lactose deficiency: a temporary lactose intolerance caused by a gastrointestional infectionImmunoglobulin E (IgE)-associated allergy to cow's milk: an allergy to cow's milk protein that causes immediate symptoms, including wheezing, runny nose, hives, and rashes. Many babies with IgE-associated milk allergy are also allergic to soy protein, so don't give soy formulas to your child unless your doctor recommends it.Galactosemia: a rare inherited disorder in which the body is unable to break down a milk sugar (galactose) to produce energyCongenital lactase deficiency: an extremely rare inherited disorder in which a baby is born with very little or none of the enzyme that breaks down the sugar lactose found in milk, causing life-threatening lactose intolerance symptomsLactose-free formula: A case of lactose intolerance or an inability to digest lactose  the sugar naturally found in milk  is rare. If your baby is lactose intolerant, his doctor may recommend a soy formula or another formula in which the lactose is replaced with a different sugar, such as corn syrup.Formula for premature and low-birth-weight babies: These formulas often contain more calories and protein, as well as a more easily absorbed type of fat called medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). How much MCT is in these formulas varies by brand. Your baby's doctor will help you select the one that will help your baby gain just the right amount of weight.Human milk fortifier: This product is used to enrich the nutrition of breastfed babies who have special needs. Some are designed to be mixed with breast milk, and some are meant to be fed alternately with breast milk.Metabolic formula: If your baby has a disease that requires very specific nutrition, he may need one of these specially developed formulas.Organic formula: According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), no research to date has proven organic milk to be healthier for children than regular milk. Since standard formula is based on milk, parents may want to consider whether organic formula is worth the higher price.Other specialty formula: New formulas come out all the time and are marketed to moms to help babies with digestion to relieve problems such as colic or acid reflux. These formulas have a protein ratio similar to breast milk and vary slightly in composition from regular formula  but some experts say they may not be any better.""More often than not, specialty formulas are substantially more expensive and not significantly different in key nutritional value, says KT Park, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Stanford's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. ""Babies undergo tremendous adaptation of their gastrointestinal tract during the first six months of life, which is normal. There are very few scenarios in which infants would require the more expensive formulas.""If you think your child might benefit from a specialty formula, ask your child's doctor about it before you stock up. How do formulas differ?There are five main components to formula: Carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals, plus other nutrients in smaller quantities. What makes one brand of formula different from the next are the specific carbohydrates and proteins as well as any additional ingredients. For example, casein and whey are two kinds of cow's milk proteins found in various proportions in different brands of cow's-milk-based formula.It's very easy to get confused by all of the items listed on the ingredient label. Below is a guide through the maze of ingredients and a comparison to the ones found in breast milk.Carbohydrate: Lactose is the main carbohydrate in both breast milk and formulas made from cow's-milk. Corn maltodextrin is sometimes used as a secondary source of carbohydrate in formula. Lactose-free, soy, and special formulas contain one or more of the following carbohydrates: Sucrose, corn maltodextrin, modified cornstarch, or corn syrup solids.Protein: Breast milk contains about 60 percent whey and 40 percent casein. Most formulas have similar protein content. Others contain 100 percent whey.Partially hydrolyzed formulas are not hypoallergenic  don't use one if your baby has a protein allergy, or even if you suspect she may have one. However, compared to standard cow's-milk formula, partially hydrolyzed whey formulas have been shown in studies to reduce eczema.Extensively hydrolyzed formulas contain proteins that are completely broken down into their building blocks (amino acids), which allow them to be easily absorbed. These formulas are considered hypoallergenic and are used for babies who have a protein allergy.Soy formulas contain soy protein isolate  a processed soybean ingredient that is almost pure protein (at least 90 percent). Some brands use partially hydrolyzed soy protein (protein is partially broken down) to allow easier digestion.Fat: Breast milk contains a blend of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated fat. Formulas use a variety of oils to match the fat makeup of breast milk. They include soy oil, coconut oil, palm or palm olein oil, and high oleic sunflower oil.Although palm and palm olein oil is widely used, research has shown that these fats can reduce absorption of fat and calcium. This would mean that your baby would not absorb as much fat and calcium as she would from a formula that doesn't contain this oil.Medium-chain triglycerides require less effort to digest and are more easily absorbed. They're used in special formulas for premature infants and for infants who have trouble digesting or absorbing nutrients.The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the addition of two long-chain fatty acids to formula: DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and ARA (arachidonic acid), which are now standard ingredients in formula. Both of these substances are found in breast milk when the mother's diet is adequate, and both are important for brain and vision development. Babies get DHA and ARA from their mother during the third trimester, but the transfer is cut short when a baby is born prematurely. All babies need a steady supply of both substances throughout their first year.Numerous studies support the supplementation of formula with DHA and ARA. One, a report published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed that full-term infants fed DHA- and ARA-supplemented formula had significantly clearer vision than infants who did not receive the supplements. And a study published in The Journal of Pediatrics states that DHA and ARA enhanced both cognitive and physical growth in preterm infants.There aren't any long-term studies confirming the safety of these substances, although there's no evidence suggesting that these additives are harmful to babies, either. The AAP hasn't taken a position on whether these fatty acids should be added to formula, but the organization does point out that they're believed to be important in brain and eye development.Vitamins and minerals: Most words on the ingredient label describe vitamins and minerals. These words can be hard to figure out  ferrous sulfate is iron, for example. Sodium ascorbate is vitamin C, and calcium pantothenate is vitamin B5.The AAP recommends that all healthy babies who aren't breastfed exclusively be given iron-fortified formula until their first birthday. It's important that babies receive the minimum recommended amount of iron (0.27 milligrams [mg] daily for infants 0 to 6 months; 11 mg daily for babies 7 to 12 months) to prevent iron-deficiency anemia.Iron is vital to the blood's ability to circulate oxygen, which all of the body's cells need to function properly. Studies have shown that getting enough iron in the first year of life is important for brain development. A baby's iron stores are established in the third trimester, so premature babies need extra help in getting plenty of iron.Most formulas contain at least 4 mg of iron per liter, although ""low-iron"" formulas are still on the shelves. These were developed years ago in response to the misconception that iron causes constipation. The AAP would like these low-iron formulas to be discontinued or labeled as nutritionally inadequate.Nucleotides: These are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, naturally present in breast milk. They have several functions and may aid in immune system development. Different brands of formula have different amounts of nucleotides added.Rice starch: Rice starch is added to ""anti-regurgitation"" formulas. Your doctor may recommend this type of formula to alleviate your baby's acid reflux.Dietary fiber: Soy fiber is added to soy formula for the temporary treatment of diarrhea. The only formula containing fiber is Similac Expert Care for Diarrhea, which is clinically shown to reduce the duration of diarrhea.Amino acids: Amino acids such as taurine, methionine, and carnitine are added to soy formulas, and sometimes to cow's-milk formulas, to match the amino acids in breast milk.Probiotics and prebiotics: Probiotics are a type of live bacteria that may help prevent intestinal infections and inflammation. Prebiotics boost the numbers of probiotic bacteria in the gut.The AAP says some studies show probiotics and prebiotics can play a role in keeping your child's digestive system healthy but they can also be unsafe for babies with compromised immune systems and certain other medical conditions, so it's best to check with your baby's doctor before using these formulas. Any benefit from probiotics and prebiotics goes away once your baby stops using them. Are generic brands nutritionally adequate?Generic brands of formula must meet the FDA's requirements for nutrients in formula, so in many instances, the only difference between generic and brand name is the price.Whether you're buying generic or name brand, take a minute to look at the label before you purchase the formula. Specific ingredients do vary from brand to brand, and this can make a difference to your baby.Can I make my own formula?Doctors strongly advise against it. If you made your own formula, it would be impossible to include all the ingredients in the right amounts for your baby. Homemade formula could lead to failure to gain weight, malnourishment, or even death.What about adding cereal or milk to my baby's formula?Never add any ingredients  including vitamins, cereal, fatty acids, olive oil, regular cow's milk, or anything else  to your baby's formula unless your doctor recommends it. Formula is a carefully developed substance with precise amounts of dozens of nutrients. Adding anything to formula could jeopardize your baby's health.Olive oil, for example, can lead to permanent lung damage and even death, because of the danger of inhaling the oil into the lungs when spitting up. Because cow's milk is so hard for babies to digest, never mix cow's milk with formula or give it to your baby straight until he's at least 1 year old. And adding breast milk to formula is a waste of breast milk if your baby doesn't drink the entire bottle.What if I'm still not sure which formula is right for my baby?If you've decided to feed your baby formula and you're still baffled by the many options available, or you're considering switching formulas, talk with your baby's doctor. He'll consider your baby's health, age, and nutritional needs and make an appropriate recommendation.He can also monitor your baby's reactions and investigate any symptoms. Don't try to diagnose an allergy or sensitivity on your own. You could miss a serious underlying condition or prevent your baby from getting adequate nutrition.If you'd like to learn more, visit the FDA pages on infant formula.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

17 things you should do before you try to get pregnant,https://www.babycenter.com/0_17-things-you-should-do-before-you-try-to-get-pregnant_7171.bc,"You've decided to take the plunge into parenthood. But wait just a second  or even a month or more. To give yourself the best chance for a healthy pregnancy and a healthy baby, there are some important things you need to do before you head down the road to conception.1. Schedule a preconception visitYou don't have to have a doctor or midwife lined up to deliver your baby yet, but call your ob-gyn, midwife, or family practice doctor now for a preconception checkup. Your practitioner will review your personal and family medical history, your present health, and any medications or supplements you're taking. Certain medications and supplements are unsafe during pregnancy, and some may need to be switched before you even try to conceive because they're stored in your body's fat and can linger there.Your practitioner will likely discuss diet, weight, exercise, and any unhealthy habits you may have (such as smoking, drinking, and taking drugs); recommend a multivitamin; make sure you're up to date on your immunizations; test you for immunity to childhood diseases such as chicken pox and rubella; and answer any questions you have. In addition, you may be referred to a specialist if you have certain medical conditions, such as asthma, diabetes, or high blood pressure, that need to be controlled before you get pregnant.If it's been at least a year since you had a checkup, you can also expect to have a pelvic exam and a Pap smear, and to be tested for sexually transmitted diseases if you're at risk.What does your OB-GYN want you to know before getting pregnant?

Consider genetic carrier screeningYour practitioner should offer you genetic carrier screening before you start trying to conceive to see whether you or your partner is a carrier for serious inherited illnesses such as cystic fibrosis, sickle cell disease, and others. If both you and your partner are carriers, your child will have a 1 in 4 chance of having the disease.You can meet with a genetic counselor who will be able to tell you more about the condition and help you sort out your reproductive choices. This may be the single most important thing you can do to help ensure a healthy baby, and all it requires is a saliva or blood sample from each of you. It's even covered by most health insurance policies.Are you pregnant?Take our quiz and find out3. Take folic acid (and watch out for vitamin A)Taking a folic acid supplement is crucial. By taking 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid a day for at least one month before you conceive and during your first trimester, you can cut your chances of having a baby with neural-tube defects such as spina bifida by 50 to 70 percent, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). Taking folic acid helps prevent some other birth defects as well.You can buy folic acid supplements at the drugstore, or you can take a prenatal or regular multivitamin. Check the label on multivitamins to make sure they contain the 400 mcg of folic acid you need.Also check to make sure that your multivitamin doesn't contain more than the recommended daily allowance of 770 mcg RAE (2,565 IU) of vitamin A, unless most of it's in a form called beta-carotene. Getting too much of a different kind of vitamin A can cause birth defects.If you're unsure about what to take, ask your healthcare provider to recommend a supplement. 4. Give up binge drinking, smoking, and drugs  and get help if you need itIf you smoke or take drugs, now's the time to stop. Many studies have shown that smoking or taking drugs can lead to miscarriage, premature birth, and low-birth-weight babies. Keep in mind that some drugs can stay in your system even after their noticeable effects have worn off.What's more, research suggests that tobacco use can affect your fertility and lower your partner's sperm count. In fact, studies have shown that even secondhand smoke may reduce your ability to get pregnant.Moderate drinking (thats one drink a day for women) is considered fine while youre trying to conceive, but youll want to avoid excessive or binge drinking at this time. And once youre pregnant, experts recommend that you stop drinking altogether since no one knows exactly what potential harmful effects even the smallest amount of alcohol has on a developing baby.Stopping unhealthy habits can be very difficult. Don't hesitate to talk with your healthcare provider. She can talk with you about tools to help you quit smoking or refer you to a program to help you stop taking drugs, for example. Your local health department may also be able to help by putting you in touch with counselors, group programs, and other assistance.5. Stock your fridge with healthy foodsYou're not eating for two yet, but you should start making nutritious food choices now so your body will be stocked up with the nutrients you need for a healthy pregnancy.Try to get at least 2 cups of fruit and 2 1/2 cups of vegetables every day, as well as plenty of whole grains and foods that are high in calcium  like milk, calcium-fortified orange juice, and yogurt. Eat a variety of protein sources, such as beans, nuts, seeds, soy products, poultry, and meats.6. Check your caffeine intakeWhile there's no consensus on exactly how much caffeine is safe during pregnancy, experts agree that pregnant women and those trying to conceive should avoid consuming large amounts. Too much caffeine has been linked to a risk of miscarriage in some (but not all) studies.The March of Dimes advises pregnant women to limit their caffeine consumption to 200 milligrams per day, about the amount in one cup of coffee, depending on the brew. That would be a good goal to aim for as you start trying to conceive.See a chart showing the amount of caffeine in various coffee brews, other drinks, and select foods, in our article on caffeine during pregnancy.7. Aim for a healthy weightYou may have an easier time conceiving if you're at a healthy weight. Having a low or high body mass index (BMI) makes it harder for some women to become pregnant.Getting to a healthier weight now can also help you get your pregnancy off on the right foot. Women with a high BMI are more likely to have pregnancy or delivery complications, while women who start with a low BMI and fail to gain enough weight are more likely to deliver underweight babies. Talk to your healthcare provider about the best way to achieve your weight goals. 8. Pay attention to the fish you eatIf you're a big fan of fish, start watching your intake. While fish is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids (which are very important for your baby's brain and eye development), protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients, it also contains mercury, which can be harmful.Most experts agree that pregnant women should eat some fish, and that the best approach is to avoid those fish that are highest in mercury and limit your consumption of all fish. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends that women of childbearing age not eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish, and eat no more than 6 ounces (one serving) of solid white canned tuna per week. Other experts suggest a longer list of fish to avoid. It's also a good idea to avoid eating fish you've caught in local waters unless you're certain there are no contaminants.The FDA and Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recommend that pregnant women eat up to 12 ounces (two servings) a week of fish that are not high in mercury. Good choices include herring, farm-raised rainbow trout, salmon, and sardines.9. Create and follow an exercise programStart and stick to a fitness plan now, and you'll be rewarded with a healthy body that's fit for pregnancy. A healthy exercise program includes 30 minutes or more of moderate exercise, such as walking or cycling and weight training, on most days of the week.To increase flexibility, try stretching or yoga, and you'll have a well-rounded fitness program. Once you're pregnant, it's okay  even recommended  to continue exercising. (Unless you have pregnancy complications and have been told not to, of course.)If exercising hasn't been a priority for you lately, you'll need to ease into an exercise routine. Start with something tame, like walking 10 to 20 minutes a day. Add more activity into your daily routine by taking the stairs instead of the elevator or parking your car a few blocks away from work.10. See your dentistWhen you're preparing for pregnancy, don't forget about your oral health. Hormonal shifts during pregnancy can make you more susceptible to gum disease. Higher progesterone and estrogen levels can cause the gums to react differently to the bacteria in plaque, resulting in swollen, red, tender gums that bleed when you floss or brush.The good news is that women who take care of their periodontal health before they get pregnant cut down on their chances of experiencing gum complications in pregnancy. See your dentist for a checkup and cleaning now if you haven't done so in the past six months. 11. Consider money mattersAccording to a 2009 report from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, middle-income families will spend $286,050 to raise a child from birth through age 17. Find out how much you're likely to spend with our Cost of Raising a Child Calculator.For the more immediate future, you'll want to consider the cost of pregnancy and delivery. Without insurance, a typical vaginal delivery can cost about $9,000 and a cesarean section about $15,000. Neonatal intensive care can cost $2,000 to $3,000 a day.If you have health insurance, give the company a call and find out what kind of prenatal coverage they offer. If you're lucky enough to have a choice of plans, compare coverage and providers. If you have a particular doctor or midwife in mind, find out if she's in your plan or how much it would cost to see her out of network.Find out what your deductibles are for prenatal visits and delivery, and ask what tests and procedures your insurance covers. (Preconception and prenatal care visits and many prenatal tests should be completely covered thanks to Obama's Affordable Care Act.) If you have a high deductible, try to put a little aside now so you won't be slammed with exorbitant bills when the baby arrives.If you dont have health insurance, contact your local health department to see what programs and resources are available in your area to help pregnant women and babies get the medical care and other services they need. Call 800-311-BABY (800-311-2229) for information on prenatal services in your area. (For information in Spanish, call 800-504-7081.)12. Consider your mental healthWomen who suffer from depression are twice as likely to have problems with fertility as women who don't, says Alice Domar, director of the Domar Center for Mind/Body Health at Boston IVF. As she points out, ""If someone is clinically depressed, she can barely take care of herself, much less a baby. From an evolutionary point of view, it makes sense that it's hard to get pregnant when you're depressed.""Domar suggests that all women, but especially those with a personal or family history of depression, do a mental health check before they get pregnant. If you notice signs of depression, such as a loss of interest and pleasure in things that you used to enjoy, a change in appetite or sleep patterns, a loss of energy, or feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness, ask your practitioner for a referral to a therapist or psychiatrist for a consultation.The two most effective treatments for depression are psychotherapy and medication, and many patients do best with a combination of both. A psychiatrist can help you find an antidepressant that's safe to take while you're trying to conceive and during your pregnancy. You also may want to try stress management techniques, such as yoga and meditation, which research suggests can help depressed women conceive.13. Avoid infectionsIt's important to steer clear of infections when you're trying to get pregnant, especially those that could harm your baby-to-be.You'll want to stay away from certain foods, such as unpasteurized soft cheeses and other dairy products, cold deli meats, and raw and undercooked fish and poultry. These foods can harbor dangerous bacteria that cause listeriosis, a food-borne illness that can lead to miscarriage or stillbirth. You should also avoid unpasteurized juices because they can contain bacteria such as salmonella or E. coli.Be sure to wash your hands frequently when preparing meals, and make sure your fridge is set between 35 and 40 degrees Fahrenheit (2 and 4 degrees Celsius) and your freezer is at or below 0 degrees F (-18 degrees C) to keep cold foods from going bad.It's a good idea to wear gloves when digging in the garden or sandbox, and to get someone else to change the litter box to avoid contracting toxoplasmosis, another infection that can be dangerous for a developing baby.Finally, make sure you get a flu shot, to avoid coming down with the flu when you're pregnant. Get vaccinated as soon as the vaccine for the coming season becomes available. Getting the flu while pregnant can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia and preterm labor. 14. Reduce environmental risksYou may not be able to entirely eliminate all environmental dangers, but you can do your best to keep as many of them as possible out of your life now. Some jobs can be hazardous to you and your unborn child, for example. If you're routinely exposed to chemicals or radiation, you'll need to make some changes before you conceive.Also, keep in mind that some cleaning products, pesticides, solvents, and lead in drinking water from old pipes can be dangerous for a developing baby. Talk to your doctor or midwife about your daily routine, and see if you can come up with ways to avoid or eliminate hazards in your home and workplace.15. Think your decision throughHaving a child is a lifetime commitment. Before you try to conceive, consider whether you're ready to take on this responsibility. Some key questions:Have you thought through how you'll handle childcare responsibilities and balancing work and family?Are you prepared to parent a special-needs child if you have one?If you have a partner, are both of you equally committed to becoming parents?If you and your partner have religious differences, have you discussed how they will affect how you raise your child?16. Figure out when you ovulateSome women simply stop using birth control when they're ready to get pregnant and let fate decide when they'll conceive. Others take a more calculated approach by charting their periods and tracking symptoms to try to pinpoint their fertile days each month.Use our Ovulation Calculator to get a rough estimate of when you're most fertile. If you want to be more exact, start charting your basal body temperature (BBT) and the changes in your cervical mucus. Tracking these symptoms over several months can help you figure out when you're ovulating during each cycle.Ovulation predictor kits can also help you figure out when you're ovulating by detecting hormones in your urine, or changes in chloride in the saliva or on the skin, that signal ovulation is about to occur. These kits cost $10 to $50 per pack and are available at drugstores.17. Toss your birth controlSo you're ready to bid adieu to birth control. For some people, ditching contraception is as easy as moving the condoms or diaphragm to the back of the dresser drawer. But going off hormonal contraception can require a bit more planning.All you have to do to reverse the effects of the Pill, the patch, or the ring is to stop using them. You don't even have to wait for the end of a monthly cycle to stop. You'll most likely get your period within a few days.For many women, fertility returns as soon as they stop using these methods, but some may take a month or so to start ovulating again. You'll know ovulation is back to normal when you're getting your period regularly.Some healthcare practitioners recommend using a barrier method and waiting until you have a couple of normal periods before trying to conceive, because this can help you establish a more accurate due date. But it's completely safe to start trying right away if you want to. And if you do get pregnant before your periods become regular again, don't worry  you can have an early sonogram to date your pregnancy.If you're using Depo-Provera, it can take up to a year after your last shot for you to start ovulating again, even if your period returns to normal sooner.

Baby poop: A complete guide,https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-poop-a-complete-guide_10319333.bc,"How often should your baby poop, and what should it look like? Most new parents don't know what to expect, and find baby poop quite surprising! It has so many shades and consistencies that even experienced parents may not have seen them all.This complete guide to baby poop walks you through the various types of baby stool and explains what's normal and what's not as your newborn grows, drinks breast milk or formula, and starts eating solids. You'll find out when not to worry and when it's wise to be concerned.Poop photosIf you'd like to see pictures of many of the poop types described below, check out our photo guide to baby poop. Yes, the photos are real!Poop frequencyThere's a wide variety of normal pooping behavior among babies: Some poop after every meal and some only once or twice a week. What's most important is that your baby's poop is coming out reasonably soft. (If it's hard and dry, your baby may be constipatedand need some help getting her pooping process back on track.)Breastfed newborns often poop after every feeding (roughly six to 10 times a day), but after three to six weeks or so, they can slow down and start having less frequent bowel movements.Other than that common slowdown, there's no need to worry if your baby's pooping pattern stays fairly consistent and she's acting like her usual self. But if there's a sudden change or you notice signs that she's uncomfortable or unhappy, give your doctor a ring.Newborn poop: MeconiumExpect to find a greenish-black, tarry, sticky poop that looks like motor oil in your newborn's diaper. Since meconium is made of amniotic fluid, mucus, skin cells, and other stuff ingested in utero, it doesn't really smell  so you may not realize it's time for a diaper change.Newborn poop: Transitional stoolWhen your baby is 2 to 4 days old, his poop will become lighter in color  sort of an army green  and less sticky. This transitional stool is a sign that he's started digesting early breast milk or formula and that his intestinal tract is A-okay.Healthy breastfed poopIf your baby is exclusively breastfed, her poop will be yellow or slightly green and have a mushy or creamy consistency. It may be runny enough to resemble diarrhea. Breastfed poop typically looks like Dijon mustard and cottage cheese mixed together and may be dotted with little seed-like flecks. Interestingly, its smell isn't half bad.There are many shades of normal when it comes to breastfed poop. One you might see is a greener hue, which could signify that you ate something different than you normally do. If your baby isn't experiencing any other symptoms, there's no need to worry.Low-calorie breastfed poopIf you see bright green and frothy poop in your baby's diaper, almost like algae, she's probably getting too much foremilk  the low-calorie milk that comes first in a feeding  and not enough hindmilk, the good higher-fat stuff. It could mean that you're not feeding her long enough on each breast. To remedy this, start each feeding on the breast you ended on last time.Healthy formula-fed poopFormula-fed babies have pasty, peanut butter-like poop on the brown color spectrum: tan-brown, yellow-brown, or green-brown. It's more pungent than poop from breastfed babies and a little less pungent than poop from babies who are eating solid food, but you'll recognize the smell.Iron-fortified poopIf you give your baby an iron supplement, his poop may turn dark green or almost black. This doesn't happen often, but it's a completely normal variation that would make Popeye proud.One thing: If your baby's poop looks blackish and he's not taking an iron supplement, it's a good idea to call the doctor to make sure it's not melena, or digested blood.Solid-food poopOnce you start changing your baby's input to solid foods  infant cereal, pureed bananas, and so on  you'll almost instantly notice a change in her output, especially if she's breastfed.Solid-food poop tends to be brown or dark brown and thicker than peanut butter, but still mushy. It's also smellier.Poop with partially digested foodOccasionally your baby's poop will have identifiable chunks of food in it or be tinged with a surprising hue of the rainbow, like red, orange, or dark blue. Red could mean beets, orange suggests carrots, and dark blue implies blueberries (you may see pieces of blueberry skin in there, too).Not to worry! You're probably seeing this because certain foods are only partially digestible or travel so quickly through the intestines that they don't have time to completely break down. It also happens when your baby eats a lot of one type of food or doesn't chew a mouthful completely before he swallows.The time to call the doctor is if your baby's poop consistently has undigested food in it. The doctor will check to make sure your baby's intestines are absorbing food and nutrients properly.DiarrheaIn babies, diarrhea is very runny and appears to be made up of water more than solids. It can be yellow, green, or brown and can seep or ""explode"" out of the diaper.Diarrhea can be a sign of an infection or allergy, and if it lasts for a while without being treated, can lead to dehydration. Call the doctor if your baby is 3 months old or younger, has more than two or three diarrhea-filled diapers, or continues having diarrhea for more than a day or two.It's also wise to call the doctor if your baby's diarrhea contains visible blood or mucus.ConstipationIf your baby's poop is hard and looks like little pebbles, she's probably constipated. Your baby may be visibly uncomfortable when she's pooping, and the poop may even be tinged with blood from irritating the anus on the way out.One or two pebbly diapers isn't a concern, but if your baby has three or more (or if you see blood), it's best to call the doctor. Constipation often happens in babies who are being introduced to solid foods, or it can be a sign of milk or soy protein sensitivity or a lack of tolerance to something in breast milk or formula. Your doctor may recommend giving your baby water, pear juice, or prune juice to help move things along.Poop with mucusDoes your baby's diaper look like it's been slimed? Greenish poop streaked with shiny, glistening strings means there's mucus in it. This sometimes happens when a baby is especially drooly, since mucus in saliva often goes undigested.But mucus in poop is also a telltale sign of an infection or allergy. If it's accompanied by any other symptoms or shows up in your baby's diaper for two days or more, call the doctor to rule out any problems.Bloody poop: Bright red bloodBright red blood can show up in baby poop for a few different reasons. Call your doctor if you notice:Normal poop tinged with red blood, which is often a sign of a milk protein allergyConstipated poop with a hint of red blood, likely a result of tears in the anus or tiny hemorrhoids.Diarrhea mixed with red blood, which can indicate a bacterial infection.Bloody poop: Blackish bloodSometimes the blood in a baby's poop looks black, which means it's been digested. When this digested blood appears in a baby's diaper  usually in little flecks that look like black poppy or sesame seeds  it's often because the baby is breastfed and swallowing blood from Mom's cracked and bleeding nipples.While this is a sign that you need some pain relief, it doesn't pose a threat to your baby. Still, you should call the doctor to make sure it's not something more serious, like bleeding from your baby's upper intestinal tract.Alarming poopAs a general rule, if you see anything completely out of the ordinary in your baby's diaper, call the doctor. There are several surprising (but, thankfully, rare!) variations on poop that suggest a serious problem:Thick black poop made up mostly of digested blood (called melena). It's dark and tarry like meconium but a bit firmer and less sticky.Poop consisting almost entirely of red blood, known as ""currant jelly poop,"" which indicates a severe intestinal problem.Pale, chalky, clay-colored poop (acholic poop) that signals liver or gallbladder failure. It looks and feels similar to tan or whitish clay or Play-Doh.These kinds of poop rarely show up, but if they do, get medical attention right away.Back to our poop pageShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a.

Cow's milk: When and how to introduce it,https://www.babycenter.com/0_cows-milk-when-and-how-to-introduce-it_1334703.bc,"Why should I wait until my baby is at least 12 months old to introduce cow's milk?Babies can't digest cow's milk as completely or easily as breast milk or formula. Cow's milk contains high concentrations of protein and minerals, which can tax your baby's immature kidneys.Cow's milk doesn't have the right amounts of iron, vitamin C, and other nutrients for infants. It may even cause iron-deficiency anemia in some babies, since cow's milk protein can irritate the lining of the digestive system, leading to blood in the stools. Finally, cow's milk doesn't provide the healthiest types of fat for growing babies.However, once your child's ready to digest it, dairy milk can supplement a balanced diet of solid foods that include cereals, vegetables, fruits and meats.Why should my child start drinking cow's milk?Milk is a rich source of calcium, which builds strong bones and teeth and helps regulate blood clotting and muscle control. It's also one of the few sources of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium and is crucial for bone growth. (Almost all milk in the United States is fortified with vitamin D.)Milk also provides protein for growth, and carbohydrates to give your child the energy he needs all day. And if your child gets enough calcium from the get-go, there's evidence that he'll have a lower risk of high blood pressure, stroke, colon cancer, and hip fractures later in life.Feeding timeline: Your child's development Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:14Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:14Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all baby videosDo I need to stop breastfeeding when my child starts drinking cow's milk?There's no need to wean your child after you introduce cow's milk. As long as you both enjoy breastfeeding, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says it's fine to continue breastfeeding past your child's first birthday.How much milk should my toddler drink?According to the AAP, your 1-year-old can get enough calcium and vitamin D from 8 to 12 ounces (1 to 1 1/2 cups) of cow's milk  or the equivalent amount of other milk products, like yogurt or cheese. By age 2, your child should get 16 ounces, or 2 cups, of cow's milk or other milk products each day.However, don't give your child more than 32 ounces (4 cups) of milk a day or she may not have room for the other foods she needs to round out her diet. If your toddler's still thirsty, offer water. Can I give my toddler fat-free or reduced-fat milk?In most cases, not yet. The AAP recommends giving whole milk to 1-year-olds unless they're at high risk for obesity. Children this age need the higher fat content of whole milk to maintain normal weight gain and to help the body absorb vitamins A and D. The concentration of protein and minerals in nonfat milk is also too high for children this age. Once your child turns 2, you may decide to switch him to reduced-fat or nonfat milk as long as he's growing well.Possible exceptions: Your child's doctor may recommend giving your child reduced-fat milk (2 percent) after age 1 if you're overweight or obese, or have a family history of obesity, high cholesterol, or cardiovascular disease.My toddler doesn't seem to want cow's milk. How can I get her to try it?Some toddlers take to cow's milk right away, but others are hesitant to make the switch because it has a different texture, taste, and even temperature than breast milk.If that's the case for your toddler, try mixing cow's milk with some breast milk or formula at first. (Try one part milk to three parts of breast milk or formula.) Then slowly shift the ratio until she's drinking 100 percent milk. It may also help to serve cow's milk at room temperature.It can be a challenge to meet the nutritional recommendations for milk or milk products if your child doesn't care for them. But there are many ways to include these in your child's diet. For example:Add milk to her cereal.Serve yogurt, cottage cheese, pudding, custard, or shakes for snacks.Make soup with milk instead of water.Add a milk-based sauce or gravy to casseroles.What if my child can't tolerate milk or can't have it because we're vegans?Regardless of the reason your child doesn't get calcium and vitamin D from milk and other dairy products, your pediatrician will probably recommend either fortified soy milk or calcium and vitamin D supplements.Should I buy organic or hormone-free milk for my child?There's no conclusive evidence that these kinds of milk are better for children, but there's no harm in them. (Organic milk does tend to be more expensive.) Read up on growth hormones in milk and organic foods to help you make a decision.However, the AAP warns against giving your child ""raw"" or unpasteurized milk, though. Without pasteurization, milk may contain harmful bacteria or parasites that can cause serious health problems.Could my child have a milk allergy?If your child drank cow's-milk-based formula as a baby without any problems, you can rest assured that he'll have no problem tolerating regular cow's milk. Even babies who were exclusively breastfed for the first year can usually handle regular cow's milk because they've been exposed to cow's milk protein in breast milk (unless you avoided all dairy).If your child drank soy formula because your doctor recommended it, check with your doctor before introducing cow's milk. Your doctor may recommend that you start with a soy beverage that's been fortified with vitamin D and calcium. (See what our experts say about giving soy milk or rice milk to a child who won't drink cow's milk.)If your child drank soy formula because your doctor recommended it, though, check with your doctor before introducing cow's milk. Your doctor may recommend that you start with a soy beverage that's been fortified with vitamin D and calcium. (See what our experts say about giving soy milk or rice milk to a child who won't drink cow's milk.)But true allergies to cow's milk are relatively uncommon: Only 2 to 3 percent of infants are allergic to milk, according to the AAP, and almost all of them outgrow it. (Learn the difference between a milk allergy and lactose intolerance.) The main symptoms of milk allergy are:Rashes or hives, especially around the mouth or chinAbdominal discomfortDiarrheaVomitingSwellingItchinessAnd chronic nasal stuffiness, a runny nose, cough, wheezing, or breathing difficulties could all be signs that a milk allergy is affecting your child's respiratory system. If your toddler develops any of these symptoms, talk with his doctor.Take your child to his healthcare provider or to the nearest emergency room immediately if he:Is extremely pale or weakHas hives all over his bodyDevelops swelling in the head or neckHas bloody diarrheaHe may be having a life-threatening allergic reaction.If it turns out that your toddler is allergic to cow's milk, you'll want to be careful to avoid foods such as cottage cheese, condensed or evaporated milk, ice cream, yogurt, margarine that contains milk, butter, milk chocolate, and powdered milk. Thanks to a law passed in 2004, all allergens must be clearly marked on food products. In this case, the label will say ""milk.""Learn more:10 nutrients every child needsShould I monitor how much fat my child eats?Best and worst drinks for thirsty kidsShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Future fathers: 9 ways to help her get pregnant,https://www.babycenter.com/0_future-fathers-9-ways-to-help-her-get-pregnant_1347929.bc,"You may not find men poring over pre-pregnancy books, stocking up on the right vitamins and minerals, and avoiding hidden dangers that could harm their baby-to-be. But this kind of male nesting behavior should be more commonplace, says F. Sessions Cole, a neonatal specialist and director of the newborn medicine division at St. Louis Children's Hospital in Missouri.When a couple is trying to get pregnant, ""most of the attention is focused on the woman,"" Cole says, ""but men make up half of the equation."" If you're thinking about becoming a dad, here's a list of what you can do to ensure a healthy pregnancy before trying to conceive.Check in with your doctorMake an appointment to see your doctor, especially if you have a chronic disease, take any medication, or experience problems with erections, ejaculation, or loss of libido.It's a good idea to have a complete physical exam so your doctor can check for conditions that may affect fertility. Some conditions to watch out for include:Varicoceles, which are enlarged veins on the scrotum (the skin covering the testicles). Varicoceles prevent the testicles from cooling normally, and doctors think that may lead to fewer, misshapen, or less mobile sperm. Although varicoceles are usually harmless, and no one knows exactly how they're related to infertility, 40 percent of men with fertility problems also have varicoceles. The condition is treatable, so talk to your doctor about the options.Sexually transmitted infections (STI), which may cause male infertility. Your doctor can test you and give you the right treatment if necessary.Prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate) or mumps (which may result in swollen testicles) may lead to infertility. Your primary care doctor can refer you to a urologist or a male fertility specialist if you need additional testing or treatments.Let your doctor know about everything you're taking, whether it's prescribed or over-the-counter. Certain medications can affect either the quality or quantity of sperm and cause male fertility problems. Such drugs include:Any steroid or hormone, particularly testosteroneSome high blood pressure drugsA few antibioticsSome medications used to treat diseases like fungal infections, ulcerative colitis, Crohn's disease, peptic ulcers, and seizuresIn most cases, the effect is reversible once you go off the drugs. Talk to your doctor about your plans to become a dad, and find out if you can safely switch to a different medication.Anabolic steroids, which bodybuilders use to bulk up, are well studied, and evidence shows they can reduce sperm count and shrink the testicles. Though herbs and supplements may seem harmless, your doctor is the best person to decide whether they could interfere with your ability to father a child.Finally, ask your doctor about any hazards you may be exposed to on the job or elsewhere. Exposure to pesticides, heavy metals, and organic solvents, for example, can affect the quality and quantity of your sperm. Get in touch with your medical rootsThe most important thing to find out is whether anyone in your family has a genetic or chromosomal disorder, such as Down syndrome, sickle cell anemia, cystic fibrosis, Tay-Sachs disease, or a bleeding disorder.It's also important to note that some conditions are related to ethnic background. For example, Tay-Sachs is common among Ashkenazi Jews and French Canadians, and sickle cell anemia occurs more frequently in African Americans than other ethnic groups.You'll also want to find out if any relatives have intellectual disability or other developmental delays, or if they were born with an anatomical birth defect, like a cardiac or neural tube defect. Your partner will need to provide this information at her first preconception or prenatal visit, and your answers can help determine whether any specific prenatal tests are recommended.You and your partner might want to consider genetic counseling. This type of counseling helps you find out what risks you face and which screening tests to consider before pregnancy.Stock your fridge with healthy foodsIf you thought you could continue mowing down chili dogs and cheese fries while your partner dines on grilled chicken and steamed vegetables, think again. Not only will it be easier for her if you follow the same healthy eating lifestyle, your sperm will be better off, too.Some studies suggest that certain antioxidants, such as vitamins C and E, can boost sperm count and motility. But before you reach for the supplements, check with your doctor. Too much C and E may damage your sperm's DNA.The American Society for Reproductive Medicine says that a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables, along with a multivitamin, may improve sperm quality. Lean protein, whole grains, and low-fat dairy can also help to enhance sperm health.Eating a healthy diet can help you maintain a healthy weight, too. Being overweight has been linked to lower testosterone, poor sperm quality, and reduced fertility. One study found that the odds of infertility increased by 10 percent for every 20 pounds of excess weight.If you have questions about your diet, check with your doctor or a nutritionist.Just say no to partyingThe party's over for your partner once you start trying for a baby, but what about you? Same goes for men, says Cole. Sperm is just as affected by tobacco, alcohol, and drugs as a woman's eggs.Research suggests that this troublesome trio may lower sperm counts and slow motility. That means you should completely cut out recreational drugs (such as marijuana and cocaine), cut down on alcohol, and quit smoking before you start trying to conceive.Plus, kicking the habit now can help your family later. Secondhand smoke is not only dangerous for your partner it's also dangerous for your child  both in utero and after birth. Even using chewing tobacco has been linked to poor sperm function.Check your workplace and home for hazardsOther hidden dangers to sperm may be lurking where you work. Regular exposure to pesticides and other chemicals such as organic solvents, which are often found in dry cleaning and auto shops, can make it more difficult to conceive. They also can alter sperm composition, leading to birth defects and premature delivery.Because it takes three months for sperm to develop and fully mature, limit your exposure to these chemicals at least three months before you and your partner start trying to conceive. Ask your employer for a copy of the Material Safety Data Sheet (MSDS) that details any chemical exposure you have at work. And visit the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's website for more information on how to avoid workplace hazards that can harm your reproductive health.Certain hobbies may expose you to harsh chemicals as well. Refinishing furniture, repairing cars, painting, building models, or any other activity that uses strippers, degreasers, or non-water-based glues and paints can expose you to solvents.Similarly, making pottery or stained glass windows and handling, shooting, and cleaning guns may expose you to lead or other heavy metals. That doesn't mean you have to drop all your hobbies and take up knitting, just check with your doctor to see what your risk level is. Buy some boxersThe jury is still out on the boxers versus briefs debate. Some say the testes can get overheated in briefs, inhibiting sperm production. Others say it's really not an issue unless sperm count is already a concern.Cole points out that if wearing boxers can potentially give you an edge over briefs, why not go with boxers for a few months? It's a fairly simple wardrobe adjustment that could speed things along.Stay out of the hot tubDon't use hot tubs, saunas, or hot baths to unwind for up to three months before trying to conceive. Heat kills sperm. And because it can take that long for sperm to regenerate, spending a long time in the hot tub in January means it could be April before you have a full set of swimmers again.Testicles function best when they keep their cool: The ""boys"" are happiest at 94 to 96 degrees, a couple of degrees cooler than normal body temperature.Be bike-savvyCasual cyclists don't need to stress about the studies that found long hours on a hard bike seat can lead to lower semen volume and reduced sperm count and motility. It's the hardcore athlete who spends more than two hours a day, six days a week in the saddle who should take note: All that riding can injure the scrotum and testes, potentially leading to fertility problems.What's more, wearing bike shorts for hours on end can kill sperm as effectively as soaking in a hot tub. The scrotal area gets hot and sweaty on a bike seat, and that can lead to lower sperm counts in avid cyclists. Men's testes are outside the body for a reason  they need a cooler environment to function properly.If you're going to ride, limit your time in the saddle, wear loose-fitting shorts, and choose the softest seat available.RelaxAlthough the possibility of getting your partner pregnant is wildly exciting, it can also be stressful, especially if conception takes several months. Take time to relax and unwind  go for a swim, shoot some hoops, or take a stroll. Studies haven't concluded that these activities will boost your conception odds, but they will certainly make the process more pleasant, says psychologist Alice Domar, assistant professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive biology at Harvard Medical School.Show sources Hide sources APA. 2011a.

Uterine fibroids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_uterine-fibroids_7187.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWhat are fibroids?Fibroids are tumors that grow from muscle cells in the uterus. They're rarely cancerous but can sometimes cause symptoms like pain and bleeding and they may interfere with the ability to get pregnant. Fibroid are found in up to 10 percent of women during pregnancy and are most common in women aged 30 to 40.Doctors call fibroids leiomyomas or myomas of the uterus. Fibroids can grow on the outside or the inside the uterus, or in the tissue of the uterine wall.Fibroids can be as small as a raisin or as large as a grapefruit. A large fibroid or cluster of fibroids can change the shape of the uterus or put pressure on the bladder or intestine.Why do women get fibroids?No one knows for sure what causes fibroids. It's likely genetics and hormones are involved. For example, fibroids can grow more when estrogen and progesterone levels are high during pregnancy. And as a woman gets close to menopause and these hormones decline, fibroids can shrink or stop growing.Researchers don't know why, but fibroids are more common in African American women. Fibroids in these women develop at an earlier age and are more severe. By menopause, about 80 percent of African American women have had fibroids, compared with 70 percent of Caucasian women.Women with a family history of fibroids also have a higher risk of developing them. It's likely that inherited genes in these women increase the odds of having fibroids.What are the symptoms of fibroids?Most women have no symptoms and may never even know they have fibroids. In other women symptoms include:Heavy or prolonged bleeding during a period (may lead to iron deficiency, or anemia)Feeling of fullness, pain, or pressure in the lower abdomenPainful cramps during a periodMore frequent or uncomfortable urinationPain during sexConstipation or painful bowel movementsDifficulty getting pregnantHow are fibroids diagnosed?Most fibroids are found during routine pelvic exams. A doctor may suspect them if she notices that a woman has a lumpy or irregularly shaped uterus.If a woman has painful or recurring symptoms, the doctor may also do an ultrasound of the uterus and ovaries. Sometimes fibroids are found on a routing ultrasound exam during pregnancy. What's the treatment for fibroids?Most fibroids don't need to be treated, but your doctor may recommend it based on:Your discomfortBlood loss during your periodsHow quickly the fibroids growYour ageIf you do need treatment, you have several options, all with benefits and risks. The right treatment depends on such factors as your symptoms, your treatment goals, and whether you want to have children.Myomectomy.During a myomectomy, the doctor removes fibroids, but leaves the uterus in place. Myomectomy is generally recommended for women who have severe fibroid-related symptoms and those having trouble getting pregnant because of fibroids.A myomectomy can relieve symptoms and preserve (or even improve) fertility for some women. However, it can lead to scarring of the pelvis or uterus, which also affects fertility. Women who get pregnant after having a myomectomy may have an increased risk of uterine rupture during labor.Depending on the size, location, and number of fibroids, a provider might do the surgery through the cervix, using a laparoscope with thin instruments and a lighted microscope inserted through several small cuts in the abdomen, or through a larger cut in the lower abdomen.A woman still has a 30 percent chance of developing a new fibroid within 10 years of a myomectomy, especially if she had multiple tumors.Hysterectomy.With a hysterectomy, the doctor removes the entire uterus. The advantage of a hysterectomy is that fibroids can't grow back. But not having a uterus also means not being able to get pregnant.A hysterectomy used to be the standard treatment for fibroids because it stopped the heavy bleeding typically associated with them. It's now generally reserved for women who don't want to get pregnant, who have severe symptoms, or who are in menopause.Medication.Medications can lower estrogen levels to shrink or temporarily stop fibroids from growing, especially before surgery. However, these drugs can cause menopause-like symptoms such as hot flashes, vaginal dryness, and reduced bone density, so doctors prescribe the drugs for six months or less. After that, fibroids will probably grow again.Blocking the blood supply.Another technique is uterine artery embolization (UAE) or uterine fibroid embolization (UFE). In this procedure, a radiologist uses a thin tube (a catheter) to inject material into the arteries leading to the uterus. This blocks the blood supply, which ""starves"" and shrinks the fibroid.Since doctors aren't sure how UAE affects fertility, this treatment isn't recommended for women who want to have children.UAE is less invasive than a myomectomy or hysterectomy. (There's just one very small cut at the artery near the groin.) What are new treatments for fibroids?In recent years, doctors have developed several less invasive ways to treat fibroids. But these procedures aren't widely available, and they're not likely to be covered by insurance. They're still being evaluated for long-term health risks and benefits, and they aren't recommended for women who want to become pregnant.These aren't yet considered standard treatments, so if you decide to pursue one, have a detailed conversation with your doctor. Ask her how much experience she has with the procedure, and be sure you understand all the possible health risks.Focused ultrasound.One new procedure is focused ultrasonic treatment. In this procedure, an MRI is used to pinpoint the exact location of a fibroid. Then, high-energy ultrasound waves are focused on the fibroid, heating it and killing cells, causing the fibroid to shrink.To learn more about this procedure or find out whether it's available near you, visit theFocused Ultrasound Foundation's website.Thermal or freezing techniques.Another relatively new treatment is called myolysis. This involves laparoscopically inserting needle probes directly into a fibroid. Then an electric current or laser destroys it and the surrounding blood vessels using heat energy. A similar treatment called cryomyolysis works the same way except that it destroys the fibroid and blood supply by freezing them.What can I do to feel better if I have fibroids?If pain or bleeding during your period is caused by fibroids and is an ongoing or worsening problem, call your doctor. You may want to ask about birth control, which can help with symptoms such as heavy bleeding, cramps, and pain during your period.Here are some suggestions for easing pain immediately:Rest on a comfortable couch or in bed when you're in pain.Put a hot water bottle or heating pad on your abdomen.Ask your doctor about taking prescription or over-the-counter pain medication.To lower the risk of anemia caused by heavy bleeding during your period, eat foods high in iron, such as lean red meat and spinach, and take iron supplements if your doctor recommends them.Is it possible to prevent fibroids?No, there's no way to prevent fibroids from developing unless you have a hysterectomy.Some companies sell supplements and natural remedies that claim to prevent or eliminate fibroids, but your provider isn't likely to recommend these products. There's no evidence to show that nutrition has any effect on fibroids, and the safety of these products is unknown.Swap stories and advice about fibroids with other parents in the BabyCenter Community.Use the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicines Find an MFM Specialist tool to locate a high-risk pregnancy doctor near you.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2011.

Twelve steps to a healthy pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_twelve-steps-to-a-healthy-pregnancy_9174.bc,"Now that you know you're pregnant, it's more important than ever to take care of yourself both physically and emotionally. You can boost your chances of having a problem-free pregnancy and a healthy baby by following a few simple guidelines.Get early prenatal careGood prenatal care is essential for you and your baby. Call your healthcare provider right away and schedule your first prenatal visit. During that visit you'll be screened for certain conditions that could lead to complications.If you haven't yet chosen a provider, get started now. Finding the right person  whether you're looking for a doctor or a midwife  can take a while. In the meantime, let your current caregiver know if you're taking medication or have any medical concerns.Watch what you eatNow that you're eating for two, you may be surprised to learn that you only need about 300 additional calories per day. Make sure you get plenty of protein. You now need 70 grams a day compared to 45 grams before you got pregnant. And while your calcium requirement remains the same, its more important than ever that you meet it, which is a challenge for many women.You'll want to steer clear of undercooked eggs and meat, unpasteurized dairy products and juices, raw seafood, and cold deli meats to avoid ingesting bacteria that could harm your baby. Also avoid certain fish that may contain high levels of mercury or other contaminants.Weight gain and pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:25Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:25Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosTake prenatal vitaminsMost prenatal supplements contain more folic acid and iron than you'll find in a standard multivitamin.It's important to get enough folic acid before conception and during early pregnancy. Folic acid greatly reduces your baby's risk of developing neural tube birth defects such as spina bifida.Ideally, you should start taking 400 micrograms of folic acid at least one month before becoming pregnant. Once your pregnancy is confirmed, up your daily dose to 600 mcg.You also need to make sure you're getting enough iron. Your iron requirement increases significantly during pregnancy, especially during the second and third trimesters.But more is not necessarily better  taking too much of certain things can actually be harmful. Avoid megadoses of any vitamin, and don't take any additional supplements or herbal preparations without your caregiver's okay.How to stay fit and healthy during pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:11Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:11Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videos Exercise regularlyA good exercise program can give you the strength and endurance you'll need to carry the weight you gain during pregnancy, help prevent or ease aches and pains, improve sluggish circulation in your legs, and help you handle the physical stress of labor. It will also make getting back into shape after your baby's born much easier.What's more, exercise is a great way to reduce stress, and some research suggests that staying active can boost your level of serotonin, a brain chemical linked to mood.Just remember not to push yourself too hard or let yourself get overheated or dehydrated. (You'll also need to avoid hot tubs and saunas while you're pregnant.)Get some restThe fatigue you feel in the first and third trimesters is your body's way of telling you to slow down. So listen up and take it easy as much as you can. If you can't swing a nap in the middle of the day, give yourself a break and let your other responsibilities slide a little. If you can't sleep, at least put your feet up and read a book or leaf through a magazine.Relaxation techniques such as yoga, stretching, deep breathing, and massage are all great ways to combat stress and get a better night's sleep.Just say no to alcoholDon't drink while you're pregnant: Any alcohol you drink reaches your baby rapidly through your bloodstream, crossing the placenta, and your baby can end up with higher levels of blood alcohol than you have.As little as one drink a day can increase your odds of having a low-birthweight baby and increase your child's risk for problems with learning, speech, attention span, language, and hyperactivity. And some research has shown that expectant moms who have as little as one drink a week are more likely than nondrinkers to have children who later exhibit aggressive and delinquent behavior.Women who have more than two drinks a day are at greater risk for giving birth to a baby with fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). Children born with this condition suffer from mental and growth retardation, behavioral problems, and facial and heart defects.Drinking also increases your risk for miscarriage and stillbirth. So play it safe  avoid alcohol completely and have a nonalcoholic drink instead. Let your caregiver know if you're having trouble giving up alcohol, so you can get help. Swear off all illicit drugsAny drug you use gets into your baby's bloodstream as well. Some studies suggest that marijuana may restrict your baby's growth and cause withdrawal symptoms (like tremors) in your newborn.Using cocaine is extremely dangerous. It restricts the flow of blood to the uterus and may lead to miscarriage, growth problems, placental abruption, or premature delivery. Your baby could be stillborn or have birth defects or developmental and behavioral problems.Other drugs can be very harmful, too. If you have a drug problem, seek help now.Stop smokingSmoking increases the risk of miscarriage, growth problems, placental abruption, and premature delivery. Some research has even linked smoking to an increased risk of having a baby with a cleft lip or palate.Not convinced yet? Smoking during pregnancy increases the chance that a baby will be stillborn or die in infancy. It's never too late to quit or cut back. Every cigarette you don't light gives your baby a better chance of being healthy. If you're unable to quit on your own, ask your caregiver for a referral to a smoking cessation program. Even if you're not a smoker, stay away from secondhand smoke.Cut back on caffeineThe March of Dimes advises women to limit their caffeine consumption intake to less than 200 mg per day, an amount you could get from one 8-ounce cup of strong coffee. This recommendation came from a 2008 study showing that women who consumed that much doubled their risk of miscarriage compared to those who had no caffeine.What's more, caffeine has no nutritive value and makes it harder for your body to absorb iron, something pregnant women are already low on. It's also a stimulant, so it can make it even harder for you to get a good night's sleep, give you headaches, and contribute to heartburn.Limit your coffee drinking or consider switching to decaf. And check the caffeine content of other products you consume, like tea, soft drinks, ""energy"" drinks, chocolate, and coffee ice cream, as well as over-the-counter drugs, such as headache, cold, and allergy remedies. Eliminate environmental dangersSome jobs can be hazardous to you and your developing baby. If you're routinely exposed to chemicals, heavy metals (like lead or mercury), certain biologic agents, or radiation, you'll need to make some changes as soon as possible.Keep in mind that some cleaning products, pesticides, solvents, and lead in drinking water from old pipes can also be harmful. Talk to your doctor or midwife about what your daily routine involves, so you can come up with ways to avoid or eliminate hazards in your home and workplace.See your dentistDon't forget about your oral health: Brush, floss, and get regular dental care. Hormonal shifts during pregnancy can make you more susceptible to gum disease. Increased progesterone and estrogen levels can cause the gums to react differently to the bacteria in plaque, resulting in swollen, bleeding, tender gums (gingivitis). So see your dentist for a checkup and cleaning now if you haven't had a visit in the last six months.Take care of your emotional healthMany women feel like they're on an emotional roller coaster at one time or another during pregnancy. But if your mood swings are extreme or interfering with your daily life, you may be suffering from depression, a relatively common condition.If you've been feeling low for more than two weeks and nothing seems to lift your spirits  or if you're feeling particularly anxious  share your feelings with your caregiver so you can get a referral for professional help.Also let your caregiver know if you're in an abusive relationship. Pregnancy can cause stress in any relationship, and it's a common trigger of domestic violence, which puts your health and your baby at risk."
Engorged breasts,https://www.babycenter.com/0_engorged-breasts_231.bc,"How can I tell if my breasts are engorged?Between the second and fifth day after giving birth, it's normal for your breasts to become larger, heavier, and a little sore as they begin producing greater quantities of milk. Some of the fullness is due to extra blood and lymph fluids in the breast tissue. This fullness usually eases within the first two to three weeks after delivery and your breasts should feel softer, even when your milk supply is plentiful.But if your breasts feel hard, swollen, throbbing, lumpy, uncomfortably full, or painful, you are likely engorged. The swelling may extend all the way to your armpit and you may even run a low fever.Engorgement can make it difficult for your baby to breastfeed effectively. A hard areola makes it challenging for your baby to latch ondeeply, which can lead to painful nipples and a low milk supply. Engorgement can also lead to serious health concerns, so call your doctor or lactation consultant if your breasts are hard and painful, if you have a fever higher than 100.4 Fahrenheit, or if your baby has problems breastfeeding.What causes engorgement?You may become engorged if you're not able to nurse your baby frequently or thoroughly enough to empty your breasts in the first few days after birth. This is important even though you may only be producing a small volume of milk right after delivery. (Learn more about how to start breastfeeding.) But some women become engorged no matter how well and often their baby breastfeeds.Breastfeeding Problem SolverFind solutions to a variety of breastfeeding challenges, including nipple pain, low milk supply, and more.You may also become engorged if your milk ducts are obstructed. This can happen if you've had breast augmentation and the implants take up so much room that there's not enough space left inside the breast for the increased blood, lymph, and milk. Ducts can also become obstructed if you regularly wear a bra that's too tight. (If you suspect your bra is too tight, read our tips to find the right bra size.)How can I prevent engorgement?Not every postpartum mom experiences engorgement. Some women's breasts become only slightly full, but others find their breasts grow astonishingly big and hard. Here are some things you can do to reduce your chances of becoming engorged:Breastfeed within two hours after birth if possible. (Your labor and delivery team should be able to help you with this.)Nurse frequently  between eight and 12 times a day after the first 24 hours. (You should offer the breast frequently during the first day as well, but the baby may not nurse eight times.) Look for your baby's hunger cues. Keeping your baby snuggled with her skin against your skin helps encourage her to breastfeed. Wake your baby if more than three hours go by from the start of one feeding session to the start of the next.Let your baby finish nursing on one breast before switching to other. This will typically take between ten and 20 minutes. (If your baby won't nurse for at least ten minutes, ask a lactation consultant whether you should pump until your baby nurses longer.) Your baby may not nurse on the other side. If she doesn't, just start on that breast next time.Avoid introducing a bottle or pacifier in the first month unless there is a medical reason to do so. The muscles used to suck on a bottle or pacifier are different than those used to breastfeed and your baby may have a hard time nursing after she's learned how to get milk from a bottle. Read our article on ""nipple confusion"" (or ""nipple preference"") to learn how it can affect your baby and how you can avoid it.If your doctor or lactation consultant has advised you to supplement with a bottle, use pumped milk instead of formula. If you do supplement with formula, make sure you hand express or pump each time the formula is given.If a feeding is skipped or your baby doesn't nurse well, hand express or use a breast pump to get the milk out.How can I treat engorgement?The good news is that taking steps to ease the pressure will help relieve engorgement more quickly. Here's how you can make breastfeeding more comfortable and ease engorgement:Just before nursing, place a warm compress on your breasts for a few minutes to get the milk flowing. You could also take a quick warm shower. Don't apply heat for more than three minutes, since too much warmth can increase swelling and make it harder for the milk to come out. If you're engorged to the point that milk isn't coming out, don't use warm compresses.Nursefrequently, with no more than two to three hours between feedings. If your breasts are uncomfortably full and your baby is sleeping, try hand expressing a little milk for relief. (It may be easier to manually express milk in the shower.) Many women find that it is uncomfortable or painful to express milk. This is an unfortunate side effect of the milk ducts being overly full, but your breasts are likely to be less tender once some of the milk is out.While your baby is nursing, gently massage the breast he's on. This encourages the milk to flow and will help relieve some of the tightness and discomfort.While your baby is having a hard time latching on, hand express some milk. Orpumpfirst, then hand express until your areola is compressible. (Unlike pumping, hand expression softens the areola, which makes it pliable enough for your baby to latch on.)If you're breastfeeding at least every two to three hours and it's going well, avoid pumping milk except when you need to soften the breast. And only pump on a low setting for a few minutes  so you're not putting in an extra ""order"" to make more milk. Excessive or habitual pumping can lead tooverproduction of milkand prolonged engorgement.To soothe the pain and help relieve swelling, apply cold packs to your breasts for about ten minutes before or after nursing. You can use crushed ice in a plastic bag or a bag of frozen peas or corn, covered with a thin cloth.Many women find a supportive nursing bra to be helpful. You may even want to wear one at night. Be sure it fits well and has no underwire. Underwire can cause constriction and clogged ducts.Consider taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen to relieve discomfort or pain. These are usually safe drugs to take while nursing.Look ahead: You'll get past this engorgement and soon be able to enjoy your breastfeeding relationship with your baby.If you have flu-like symptoms or a fever that climbs to 101 degrees F or higher, call your doctor. You may have a breast infection.How long does engorgement last?Fortunately, engorgement passes pretty quickly for most women. You can expect it to ease up in 24 to 48 hours if you're nursing well or pumping at least every two to three hours. If not treated, engorgement can take up to ten days to start to go away.Once the engorgement passes, your breasts will be softer, although still full of milk. If you'renot nursing, it will probably get worse before it gets better. Even if you're not breastfeeding, you may need to pump to relieve the pressure on your breasts and minimize your risk for breast infections. Discuss techniques to reduce this risk with your doctor or midwife.Can I still nurse?Yes, you can and should nurse. Unrelieved engorgement can cause a low milk supply, plugged ducts, mastitis, or a serious breast abscess, so it's important to nurse frequently from the very beginning.If possible, breastfeed your baby in the first hour or two after he's born, and nurse often from that point on. Watch your baby for signs of hunger, such as sucking his fist and becoming restless. Don't put a newborn on a feeding schedule or wait until he's crying in hunger.Will engorgement affect my baby?Engorgement can make it harder for a baby to latch on. Talk to your baby's doctor if you're concerned she's not getting enough milk.Learn moreFind out how and when to use a breast pumpLearn how to express milk by handReview the basics with our visual guide to breastfeedingGet tips from breastfeeding veteransLearn about lactation consultants and how to find oneFind answers fast with our Breastfeeding Problem SolverShow sources Hide sources Arora S, et al. 2008.

"What's the outlook for premature babies born before 28, 31, 33, or 36 weeks?",https://www.babycenter.com/0_whats-the-outlook-for-premature-babies-born-before-28-31-33_10300031.bc,"What's the outlook for babies born earlier than 28 weeks?Fewer than 1 percent of babies in this country are born this early, but these babies have the most complications.Most of these babies are born at extremely low birth weight (less than 2 pounds, 3 ounces). Almost all require treatment with oxygen, surfactant, and mechanical assistance to help them breathe.These babies are too immature to suck, swallow, and breathe at the same time, so they must be fed through a vein (intravenously) until they develop these skills. They often can't yet cry (or you can't hear them due to the tube in their throat), and they sleep most of the day. These tiny babies have little muscle tone, and most move very little.Babies born at this time look very different than full-term babies. Their skin is wrinkled and reddish-purple in color and is so thin that you can see the blood vessels underneath. Their face and body are covered in soft hair called lanugo. Because these babies haven't had time to put on fat, they appear very thin. Most likely, their eyes are closed and they have no eyelashes.These babies are at high risk for one or more medical complications. However, most babies born after about 26 weeks' gestation do survive to one year (about 80 percent of those born at 26 weeks and about 90 percent of those born at 27 weeks), although they may face an extended stay in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU).Unfortunately, about 25 percent of these very premature babies develop serious lasting disabilities, and up to half may have milder problems, such as learning and behavioral problems. What about babies born at 28 to 31 weeks' gestation?These babies look quite similar to babies born earlier, although they are larger (usually between 2 and 4 pounds) and even more likely to survive (about 96 percent).Most require treatment with oxygen, surfactant, and mechanical assistance to help them breathe. Some of these babies can be fed breast milk or formula through a tube threaded through their nose or mouth into the stomach, although others will need to be fed intravenously.Some of these babies can cry. They can move more, although their movements may be jerky.A baby born at this time can grasp a finger. These babies can open their eyes, and they begin to stay awake and alert for short periods. Babies born at 28 to 31 weeks are at risk for medical complications. However, when complications occur, they may not be as severe as those of babies born earlier. Babies born with a very low birth weight (less than 3 pounds, 4 ounces) remain at risk for serious disabilities.What about babies born at 32 to 33 weeks' gestation?About 98 percent of babies born at this time survive. Most weigh between 3 and 5 pounds and appear thinner than full-term babies. Some can breathe on their own, and many just need supplemental oxygen to help them breathe.Some can be breastfed or bottle-fed, but those who have breathing difficulties will probably need tube feeding.Babies born at this time are less likely than babies born earlier to develop serious disabilities resulting from premature birth, though they remain at a higher risk for learning and behavioral problems. Are babies born at 34 to 36 weeks' gestation at risk for medical problems?Late preterm infants are usually healthier than babies born earlier, and they're almost as likely to survive as full-term babies. Late preterm babies often weigh between 4 1/2 and 6 pounds, so they may still appear thinner than full-term babies.These babies remain at higher risk than full-term babies for newborn health problems, including breathing and feeding problems, difficulties regulating body temperature, and jaundice. These problems are usually mild, and most babies make a quick recovery.Most of these babies can be breastfed or bottle-fed, although some (especially those with mild breathing problems) may need tube feeding for a brief time. It's estimated that at 35 weeks' gestation, the weight of the brain is only about two-thirds that of full-term infants. Late preterm babies are unlikely to develop serious disabilities resulting from premature birth, but they may be at a higher risk for subtle learning and behavioral problems."
Cow's milk: A powerful ally,https://www.babycenter.com/0_cows-milk-a-powerful-ally_10372093.bc,"Why do experts recommend that children drink cow's milk?Milk is a rich source of calcium, which builds strong bones and teeth and helps regulate blood clotting and muscle control. And it's one of the few sources of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium and is crucial for bone growth. Almost all milk in the U.S. is fortified with vitamin D. (Ultraviolet rays are another source, but they're blocked by sunscreen.)Milk also provides protein for growth, as well as carbohydrates, which will give your child the energy he needs. And if your child gets enough calcium from the get-go, there's evidence that he'll have a lower risk of high blood pressure, stroke, colon cancer, and hip fractures later in life.How much milk should my child drink?According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), most kids will get enough calcium and vitamin D if they drink 16 to 20 ounces (2 to 2 1/2 cups) of cow's milk a day. (Most 1-year-olds should have whole milk. Low-fat or fat-free milk is fine for children 2 and older.)Don't offer more than 3 cups of milk a day or your child may not have room for the other foods she needs to round out his diet. If your child's still thirsty, offer water.My child doesn't like cow's milk. Any tricks I can try?Meeting the minimum requirement of 2 cups can be a challenge if your child doesn't care for milk. But there are many ways to get milk into your child's diet: Add it to his cereal. Serve yogurt, cottage cheese, pudding, custard, or shakes for snacks. Make soup with milk rather than water. Add a milk-based sauce or gravy to casseroles.What if my child doesn't like any dairy products? Or if she's allergic or we're vegans?If your child isn't getting enough calcium and vitamin D from milk and other dairy products, perhaps because she can't tolerate them or your family is vegan, your pediatrician will probably recommend calcium and vitamin D supplements.Should I buy organic or hormone-free milk for my child?There's no conclusive evidence that these kinds of milk are better for children, but there's no harm in them. (Organic milk does tend to be more expensive.) Read up on growth hormones in milk and organic foods to help you make a decision.The AAP warns against giving your child ""raw"" or unpasteurized milk, though. Without pasteurization, milk may contain harmful bacteria or parasites that can cause serious illness or even death.Could my child have a milk allergy?True allergies to cow's milk are relatively uncommon. Only 2 to 3 percent of children are allergic to milk, according to the AAP, and almost all of them outgrow it by age 3. (Learn the difference between a milk allergy and lactose intolerance.)If your child drank cow's-milk-based formula as a baby without any problems, you can rest assured that she'll have no problems tolerating regular cow's milk. Even babies who were exclusively breastfed for the first year can usually handle regular cow's milk because they've been exposed to cow's milk protein in their mother's milk (unless their mother avoided all dairy).If your child drank soy formula because your doctor recommended it, though, check with your doctor before starting her on cow's milk. Your doctor may recommend that you start with a soy beverage that's been fortified with vitamin D and calcium. (See what our experts say about giving soy milk or rice milk to a child who won't drink cow's milk.)The main symptoms of milk allergy are blood in the stool, diarrhea, and vomiting. If your child also develops eczema, hives, a rash around the mouth and chin, chronic nasal stuffiness, a runny nose, cough, wheezing, or breathing difficulties, it could be a sign that the respiratory system is being affected by a milk allergy. If your toddler develops any of these symptoms, talk with her doctor.If your child appears to have sudden and severe problems with breathing or swallowing, take her to the nearest emergency room. She may be having a life-threatening allergic reaction.If it turns out that your toddler is allergic to cow's milk, you'll want to be careful to avoid foods such as cottage cheese, condensed or evaporated milk, ice cream, yogurt, margarine that contains milk, butter, milk chocolate, and powdered milk. Thanks to a law passed in 2004, all allergens must be clearly marked on food products  in this case, the label will say ""milk."""
Postpartum fatigue: How to cope,https://www.babycenter.com/0_postpartum-fatigue-how-to-cope_1152217.bc,"It's been several weeks since I had my baby, and I'm still tired all the time. Will I ever feel rested again?Feeling tired  or just plain wiped out  is one of new moms' most common complaints. After all, your body is recuperating from the incredible physical challenge of pregnancy and childbirth (and, if you had a c-section, major abdominal surgery). At the same time, you're caring for a newborn who needs food, diaper changes, and hands-on attention around the clock, so what sleep you do get is likely to be less restorative because it's so fragmented.Unfortunately, the fatigue can last for months, depending on a host of factors, including how well your baby sleeps (and how adept you are at adjusting your schedule to his), the amount of support you have at home, and possibly added demands of work outside the home.Could there be other reasons for my fatigue?Maybe. There's an association between extreme fatigue and postpartum depression, though it's often not clear what's causing what. (Chronic sleep deprivation may contribute to your feeling depressed, and feeling depressed can make sleeping more difficult.)In any case, if you find that you can't sleep, have lost interest in doing anything, and feel despairing, you could be suffering from postpartum depression. Call your healthcare practitioner for a referral to a therapist.Anemia may also cause  or add to  your fatigue. If you were anemic during pregnancy or lost a lot of blood at delivery, your practitioner may advise to you to take iron supplements in addition to prenatal vitamins.Postpartum fatigue can sometimes be a symptom of an underactive thyroid gland, also known as hypothyroidism. A small percentage of women develop this condition four to eight months after giving birth. Talk to your ob-gyn or midwife if your fatigue gets worse around this time. Hypothyroidism is treatable. What can I do to cope with fatigue?Keep in mind that your priority right now is saving energy for yourself, your baby, and your other children, if you have any. That may mean relaxing your usual standards a little (or a lot) when it comes to housecleaning. Or it may mean that you take your spouse out to dinner this year for his birthday instead of throwing a party.You're likely to get your energy back faster in the long run if you conserve it now.Here are some specific coping strategies:Get all the rest you can. Sleep when your baby sleeps. Try to go to bed at night soon after he settles in, and during the day, nap when he does. If you find napping impossible, at least put your feet up and close your eyes. If you're breastfeeding, try nursing lying on your side, so you can really relax during some of his feedings.Take any opportunity you can to rest, even when you have visitors. Your family and friends will understand (if they don't, explain it to them) and can entertain themselves.Drink plenty of fluids, try to make healthy food choices, and don't skip meals. Now is not the time to crash diet. Food is your fuel.Though you may feel an immediate pickup from caffeine and sweets, don't rely on them. In the long run you're better off without the quick boost. Instead, go for the long haul with foods that will help provide sustained energy, like those high in complex carbohydrates and protein.You may want to continue taking prenatal vitamins, too, especially if you're breastfeeding.Take your baby out for a walk. Start by walking slowly and going only a short distance. As you regain your strength, gradually step up your pace and the length of your walk. Exercise can give you a boost of energy, and the fresh air and movement may help you both sleep better at night.Call on friends and family for help. Who can do chores, cook meals, help with your other children, or run errands? Who would enjoy caring for the baby while you lie down for a bit? Identify those people and ask them to do specific things. Most people appreciate the opportunity to help.Choose your houseguests wisely. If you get along well with your mother or mother-in-law and she loves cooking and cleaning, by all means invite her over. But if she'll be more of a burden than a help, it's best to delay an extended visit. And remember that it's perfectly fine to tell even the best of friends that you're just too tired for visitors today.Consider hiring a postpartum doula if you don't have a good support network and it won't put too much of a strain on your finances. These women are experienced in mother and newborn care and will come to your home to help with housework, cooking, and childcare, offer breastfeeding support, or run errands.If you work outside the home but don't feel ready to jump back in and can afford to wait, check out ways to extend your maternity leave."
Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),https://www.babycenter.com/0_inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd_1389867.bc,"My child may have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). What is IBD?IBD is a disease in which parts of the intestines become inflamed and may develop ulcers, or sores. Experts don't know what causes this disease, but most likely it's at least partially inherited.Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation, as well as weight loss, fever, exhaustion, and the urge to have a bowel movement even when the bowels are empty. Because IBD causes ulcers in the intestines, there may also be blood in the stools.There are two kinds of IBD: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). UC affects the inner lining of the large intestine; CD affects deeper layers of tissue, usually in the small intestine and the colon. But Crohn's can appear in any or all parts of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus.Current treatments can put these conditions into remission, but children with IBD may have flare-ups throughout life. That said, in general children with IBD can attend school regularly, participate in sports and activities, and lead healthy, happy lives.About a million people in the United States have IBD, and while the peak incidence is between the ages of 15 and 25 years, it can strike at any time. In fact, 25 to 30 percent of patients with CD and 20 percent of patients with UC are under the age of 20. And the number of early childhood cases has been increasing.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.How is IBD diagnosed?Your child's doctor will order some initial tests, such as stool studies and blood work. If those test results point to IBD  or if the symptoms persist  you'll be referred to a gastroenterologist.The gastroenterologist may order more blood and stool tests, and will perform an endoscopy, a colonoscopy, or both.For those procedures, a tiny tube with a camera on it (an endoscope) is passed through the mouth (for the upper gastrointestinal tract), through the anus (for the lower gastrointestinal tract) into your child's colon, or both. The doctor may also take a tissue sample from the intestines to look for signs of inflammation under a microscope. The procedure isn't painful, but kids are typically sedated.To help confirm the diagnosis and make sure no other conditions are involved, the doctor may also order imaging studies, such as X-rays, a CT scan, or an MRI of your child's abdomen.What's the treatment for IBD?Inflammatory bowel disease is often treated with a combination of medications. Steroids and drugs that suppress the immune system both reduce inflammation. Antibiotics can help heal any infections in the gastrointestinal tract.Once the inflammation and other symptoms (such as diarrhea) are gone and the intestinal lining has healed, the disease is in remission. Your child may be kept on some medications to prevent a relapse.Although no dietary change has been clearly shown to help IBD, most kids with IBD need to pay attention to their diet to help control their symptoms and maintain good nutrition. The best diet for a child depends on whether he has CD or UC, and it may involve keeping track of what he eats to identify foods that cause increased symptoms.He may also need to eat specific nutrient-rich foods and take supplements to make up for any deficiencies caused by the disease. For some children with CD, a liquid formula diet for a period of four to six weeks can help improve symptoms, maintain remission, and reverse poor weight gain and growth.The only way to ""cure"" UC is by surgically removing the entire colon. (Of course, this is considered only for severe and persistent cases. Your child may have a mild or manageable case.) There is no permanent cure for CD.The goal for both conditions is to get them into remission and keep them there.Does IBD cause other health problems?IBD can cause liver disease, gallstones, or kidney stones. It can also cause anemia because someone with intestinal ulcers can lose a lot of blood.Areas of the body outside the gastrointestinal tract (such as the joints, skin, or eyes) can develop problems. CD can also cause fistulas: tunnels of tissue that develop between sections of intestine or between the intestine and the skin, anus, or vagina. They're dangerous because they can become infected.CD can leave scars in the small intestine, creating blockages. These can interfere with the ability of your child's small intestine to absorb nutrients. For as many as 30 percent of kids with CD, this delays development and stunts their growth.UC increases the risk for colon cancer later on in life. In rare cases, a bad bout of colitis or CD can lead to a serious condition called toxic megacolon, in which the colon becomes paralyzed and can't function normally. If this happens, medications can often correct it, but if not, part of the colon has to be surgically removed.Article reviewed by Maria Olivia-Hemker, M.D., Chief of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Stermer Family Professor of Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and co-editor of Your Child With Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Johns Hopkins Press).Show sources Hide sources Johns Hopkins Children's Center. 2011.

Sleep aids during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sleep-aids-during-pregnancy_7914.bc,"Even if you're a great sleeper, it's normal to toss and turn during pregnancy. Sometimes you just can't get comfortable, especially in your first and third trimesters. If you've already read up on the pregnancy sleep basics but need more help, here are a few more suggestions for getting the sleep you crave.PillowsFor back and belly supportUsing pillows for support can mean the difference between a sleepless night and peaceful slumber.Tucking a pillow between your bent knees supports your lower back and may make the recommended side-sleeping position more comfortable. A pillow tucked behind your back can also help you maintain a side-lying position while you sleep.You can experiment with regular pillows or check out pillows made specifically for use during pregnancy, sold online and in maternity stores. You'll find body-length pillows, C-shaped and U-shaped pillows, and wedges that support your belly when you lie on your side or to prop yourself up to a semi-recline.How to sleep like a baby when you're expecting one Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:39Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:39Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosFor heartburnIf you suffer from heartburn, experiment with an extra pillow to raise your head while sleeping. Some moms-to-be find relief after raising the head of the bed  by sliding pillows under the head of the mattress, for example.For hip reliefAn egg-crate foam mattress pad placed on top of your mattress can also help you sleep more comfortably if your hips hurt when you lie on your side.Food and drinkWhat you eat  and when you eat it  can affect the quality of your sleep.Warm milkDrinking a glass of warm milk before bedtime is a time-honored way to bring on sleep. Many experts believe the amino acid L-tryptophan (found in milk and other foods such as turkey and eggs) makes eyelids heavy by raising the level of a chemical in the brain called serotonin.Others suggest the sleep-inducing effects of warm milk are all in your head. But if it helps you doze off, does it really matter?Warning: Don't go all the way and take tryptophan supplements  they're not safe during pregnancy.Is It Safe During Pregnancy?Our experts answer your most pressing questions about what is and isn't safe during pregnancy.Protein-packed snacksIf bad dreams, headaches, or full-body sweats disturb your sleep, you could be suffering from low blood sugar. Try a high-protein snack before bed to keep your blood sugar up during the night. Good protein choices include an egg, peanut butter, or a slice of turkey.Nausea may strike an empty stomach. Dietitian Bridget Swinney, author of Eating Expectantly, recommends eating a light bedtime snack that contains carbohydrates and protein. A high-protein cereal with milk, half a sandwich with milk, or a high-protein smoothie are all good choices.It's also a good idea to keep a dry, bland snack  such as crackers, pretzels, or rice cakes  at your bedside in case you wake up feeling queasy.At the same time, if you suffer from indigestion or heartburn, try to avoid large meals late in the day. Lying down with a full stomach will only make matters worse. MedicationIdeally you'll be able to avoid all medications (including herbal remedies) during pregnancy. Most drugs haven't been tested on pregnant women, and it can be hard to know what effect they'll have on your baby.If you have a severe sleep problem or disorder, though, your doctor or midwife may recommend a prescription or over-the-counter drug to use during your second or third trimester. It's important never to take any medication during pregnancy without first consulting your healthcare provider.Over-the-counter remediesAsk your doctor or midwife which over-the-counter medicines would be safe for you to try. The antihistamines diphenhydramine hydrochloride and doxyalamine are sometimes used as sleep aids because drowsiness is a side effect. (These ingredients are found in Benadryl, Sominex, and Unisom, for example.)Other possible side effects include impaired alertness and dizziness, so don't drive or operate machinery after taking either of these medications. And again, check with your healthcare provider before taking any medication while you're pregnant.Prescription medicineIf you're suffering from severe insomnia or anxiety, your healthcare provider may recommend that you take a prescription sleep medication. Never drive or operate machinery after taking a drug to help you sleep."
When you just can't breastfeed,https://www.babycenter.com/0_when-you-just-cant-breastfeed_8485.bc,"When Bay Area parent Charlene Hedge gave birth to her son, she took it for granted that she would breastfeed him. But it was not to be. Hedge couldn't produce enough breast milk, and even though she fed her baby every hour in hopes of increasing her milk supply, her son still wasn't getting what he needed.""They always say breast milk is best,"" she says. ""That I couldn't provide for him bothered me for a bit.""Her son fussed constantly, frustrated and unhappy. And Hedge was exhausted by the hourly feedings. Three weeks later, after consulting her doctor, the nurses at the hospital, and her baby's doctor, she called it quits.""Nature just didn't work for me,"" says Hedge, whose son grew into a healthy, happy toddler. ""I could cry and get really depressed, but it wasn't going to change anything."" So she let the whole thing go.Whatever your reasons for not breastfeeding  health, intense discomfort, or unrelenting frustration  give yourself a break. ""Good parenting is more than breastfeeding,"" says Jan Barger, an international board certified lactation consultant (IBCLC).Did you try your best to nurse your baby? Did you turn to others  a lactation consultant, your midwife or doctor, your baby's doctor, your partner  for help? If so, chances are you've already exhausted all available resources and are doing what's best for you and your baby.What should I do now that I'm not breastfeeding?Give yourself a breakIf you've been dead set on breastfeeding since pregnancy, you're probably feeling disappointed. Just like moms who opt for natural childbirth but end up needing a cesarean, women who want to breastfeed but can't often feel a sense of failure and sometimes blame themselves.Try not to beat yourself up, but do take the time you need to feel sad, mad, or any other emotion you may be experiencing. ""Mourn your inability to breastfeed,"" says Barger. ""For some moms, this is a loss."" Avoid telling yourself that you should've tried for another day or another feeding. ""Some of us have a lot of stick-to-it-iveness,"" says Barger. ""But some just don't. And that's okay.""And even though experts say that breastfeeding is the best nutritional option for babies, it's not right  or possible  for every mother. In 2016, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reinforced the advice to breastfeed if at all possible, but said a woman's doctors should respect her opinion about whether breastfeeding is right for her.Today's commercially prepared formulas are nutritious and even contain some vitamins and nutrients that breastfed babies need to get from supplements, so if you can't breastfeed you can still feel confident that your baby is getting what she needs.Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.Talk about your feelingsIf you consulted a lactation expert through all your nursing troubles, talk to her. Be honest about your feelings. She'll likely offer soothing and consoling words that you should take to heart.Your spouse or partner, good friends, and family members can also be great sounding boards for your feelings. Take a chance and open up to them.Find out about donated breast milkIf your heart's set on feeding your baby breast milk and your child meets certain criteria  like being premature or ill  you may qualify for donated breast milk from a milk bank. Talk to your child's doctor about the possibilities.Can I still bond with my baby if I don't breastfeed?Absolutely. Breastfeeding is a wonderful way to strengthen your connection with your child, but it isn't the only way. At feeding time, hold your infant close to you and make eye contact.One client of Barger's who couldn't breastfeed ended up bottle-feeding her child as if she were nursing him. She held him in a breastfeeding position and had lots of skin-to-skin contact.Remember that your relationship with your child won't be based solely on your ability to nurse her. How you respond when she cries, how often you hold and play with her, and how you are as a parent matters more than how you feed her.Where can I turn for support?BabyCenter's Formula Feeding Mamas group is a great place to find other moms who are bottle-feeding, whether by choice or necessity.

What to expect at your prenatal visits,https://www.babycenter.com/0_what-to-expect-at-your-prenatal-visits_9252.bc,"How many prenatal visits will I have?You'll see a lot of your healthcare practitioner during your pregnancy  that's why it's so important to choose someone you like and trust. Most pregnant women have between ten and 15 prenatal visits.If you have a partner or labor coach, you may want that person to come to some of these appointments with you.Typically, a mom-to-be will visit her doctor or midwife every four weeks during the first and second trimesters. In the third trimester, you'll be seen more often, typically once every two weeks until 36 weeks, then weekly until the baby is born.For more information on what happens at these visits, see:Your first prenatal visitSecond trimester prenatal visits (14 weeks to 27 weeks)Third trimester prenatal visits (28 weeks through the end of pregnancy)But the number of scheduled appointments you'll have depends on your medical history and whether you have any complications or conditions such as high blood pressure that warrant more frequent checkups. If you've had any medical problems in the past or develop any new problems during this pregnancy, you may need more prenatal visits than average.Is there anything I need to do to prepare for my prenatal visits?During the weeks before each visit, jot down any questions or concerns in a notebook so you'll remember to ask your practitioner about them at your next appointment. You may be surprised by how many questions you have, so don't miss the opportunity to get some answers in person.For example, before you drink an herbal tea or take a supplement or an over-the-counter medication, bring it with you to your next appointment so your doctor or midwife can read the label and let you know whether it's okay to ingest.Of course, if you have any pressing questions or worries, or develop any unusual symptoms, don't wait for your appointment  call your practitioner right away.Pregnancy swelling (edema) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:50Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:50Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Get tips for prevention and when to call your doctor. See all pregnancy videosWhat happens during these appointments?Your practitioner will start by asking how you're feeling physically and emotionally, whether you have any complaints or worries, and what questions you may have. Your practitioner will have other questions as well, which will vary depending on how far along you are and whether there are specific concerns.The goal of prenatal visits is to see how your pregnancy is proceeding and to provide you with information to help keep you and your baby healthy. It's important that you go to all of your prenatal appointments, even if you're feeling just fine and believe that everything is progressing perfectly.Your midwife or doctor will check your weight, blood pressure, and urine; measure your abdomen; check the position of your baby; listen to your baby's heartbeat; perform other exams and order tests, as appropriate; and closely monitor any complications you have or that you develop, and intervene if necessary.At the end of the visit, your practitioner will review the findings with you, explain the normal changes to expect before your next visit and the warning signs to watch for, counsel you about lifestyle issues (such as the importance of good nutrition and avoiding tobacco, alcohol, and drugs), and discuss the pros and cons of optional tests you may want to consider. It seems like my prenatal visits are over before they even start. How can I make the most of my appointments?Many women look forward to their prenatal appointments but are disappointed to find that, with the exception of the first visit, they're in and out of the office in ten minutes. A quick visit is usually a sign that everything is progressing normally. Still, you want to make sure that your concerns are addressed  and that you and your baby are being well taken care of.Here are some things you can do to insure that your prenatal visits are satisfying:Speak up. Your practitioner isn't a mind reader and won't be able to tell what you're thinking just by performing a physical examination. So if anything is bothering you, speak up. Consult the notebook of questions you've been compiling. In addition to any physical complaints you may have, let your practitioner know if you have any emotional concerns or fitness or nutrition questions.Ask the staff about the administrative stuff. Save your questions about things like insurance and directions to the hospital for the office staff so your practitioner has more time to answer your important questions.Be open-minded. When talking with your doctor or midwife, you should feel comfortable speaking freely, but remember to listen, too. Take notes, if you find it helpful.And keep in mind that some days are busier than others. That doesn't mean your practitioner doesn't have to answer your questions, but sometimes a discussion can be continued at the next visit if it's a really busy day or if your practitioner needs to head to the hospital to deliver a baby.At the same time, don't tolerate a healthcare practitioner who won't give you thorough answers, doesn't show reasonable compassion, or barely looks up from your chart. You and your baby deserve more than that."
Common first trimester blood tests,https://www.babycenter.com/0_common-first-trimester-blood-tests_9273.bc,"Blood type, Rh factor, and antibody screeningAt your first prenatal visit, your practitioner will check your blood to see whether it's type O, A, B, or AB, and whether it's Rh-negative.If you're Rh-negative, you'll get a shot of Rh immune globulin at least once during your pregnancy, and another after you give birth if your baby turns out to be Rh-positive.This shot will protect you from developing antibodies that could be dangerous during this pregnancy or in future pregnancies. (Note: If the baby's father is also Rh-negative, your baby will be too, so you won't need the shot.)Your blood will also be checked for Rh antibodies as well as some other antibodies that may affect your pregnancy.Complete blood countA complete blood count will tell your practitioner if you have too little hemoglobin in your red blood cells (a sign of anemia) and, if so, whether it's likely to be the result of iron deficiency.If you're iron deficient, your practitioner will recommend that you take iron supplements and eat more iron-rich foods, such as lean meat.The test also counts your platelets and white blood cells. (An elevated number of white blood cells could indicate an infection.)Rubella (German measles) immunityThis test, called a rubella titer, checks the level of antibodies to the rubella virus in your blood to see whether you're immune. Most women are immune to rubella, either because they've been vaccinated or had the disease as a child.During pregnancy, the rubella virus can cause a miscarriage, preterm birth, or stillbirth, as well as a variety of serious birth defects, depending on how far along you are when you contract the virus. So if you aren't immune, it's very important to avoid anyone who has the infection and forgo travel to foreign countries where the disease is still prevalent. (Fortunately, rubella is rare in the United States.)Although you can't be vaccinated while you're pregnant, you should get the vaccine after you give birth to protect future pregnancies.Hepatitis B testingMany women with this liver disease have no symptoms and can unknowingly pass it to their baby during labor or after birth. This test will reveal whether you're a hepatitis B carrier.If you are, your practitioner will protect your baby by giving him an injection of hepatitis B immune globulin as well as his first shot of the hep B vaccine within 12 hours of birth. (He'll get the second shot at 1 or 2 months and the third at 6 months.) All members of your household should be tested and vaccinated if you're a carrier.Syphilis screeningThis sexually transmitted infection (STI) is relatively rare today, but all women should be tested because if you have syphilis and don't treat it, both you and your baby could develop serious problems. In the unlikely event that you test positive, you'll be given antibiotics to treat the infection.HIV testingThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and a host of other organizations recommend that all pregnant women be tested for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the virus that causes AIDS. If you test positive for HIV, you and your baby can get treatment that will help maintain your own health and greatly reduce the chance that your baby will become infected with the virus.Other blood testsIf you're not sure whether you've ever had chicken pox or been vaccinated against it, you can be tested to see if you're immune. If you're at high risk for diabetes, a glucose challenge test may be done at your first visit.In addition, all women should be offered first-trimester screening for Down syndrome and some other chromosomal abnormalities. This generally involves a blood test as well as an ultrasound to measure the baby's nuchal fold.Your caregiver may recommend some other blood tests for genetic disorders, depending on your situation and preferences. Some of these, like the test that determines whether you're a cystic fibrosis carrier, may be offered to you even if you're not in a high-risk category.Unless there's a problem that needs to be addressed right away or you're particularly concerned about a certain test, your practitioner will generally wait until your next appointment to review your test results with you.Prenatal test: Nuchal translucency scan (NT scan) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:49Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:49Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Postpartum rectal bleeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_postpartum-rectal-bleeding_11709.bc,"I've noticed some rectal bleeding since having my baby. What's happening?Rectal bleeding during pregnancy or after you give birth is typically caused by hemorrhoids  varicose veins in and around the rectum. Hemorrhoids are relatively common during pregnancy, particularly in the last trimester and in the weeks after giving birth. If you strain during a bowel movement or pass hard stools  a common scenario if you're suffering from constipation  or rub exposed hemorrhoids when you wipe, these swollen veins may bleed.Passing hard stools as the result of constipation can also cause cracks in the skin of the anus. These are called anal fissures, and they can be quite painful, particularly during and just after a bowel movement.Though these are by far the most likely culprits during pregnancy and after you give birth, gastrointestinal disease may also result in rectal bleeding.What can I do to prevent this problem?It's not uncommon for your bowels to be a bit sluggish in the days after you give birth. Since both hemorrhoids and anal fissures are often brought about and irritated by constipation, staying regular can help.Here are some tips for preventing and easing constipation:Eat high-fiber foods such as cereals, whole-grain breads, beans, and fresh fruits and vegetables every day. If that alone doesn't do the trick, try adding a couple of tablespoons of unprocessed wheat bran to your cereal in the morning. (You may want to start with a smaller amount of bran and gradually increase the amount to avoid becoming gassy.) Be sure to follow it with a large glass of water.Drink plenty of water. A glass of fruit juice each day, especially prune juice, can also be helpful. Exercise regularly. Walking, swimming, and yoga can all help ease constipation and leave you feeling more fit and healthy.Postpartum exercises: Introduction Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:52Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:52Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all baby videosListen to your body. Never put off going to the bathroom when you feel the urge, even if your bottom is tender and it's uncomfortable to do so. Waiting will only exacerbate the problem.Ask your healthcare provider about taking an over-the-counter fiber supplement or a stool softener.What can I do for relief?Here are some suggestions to help you deal with hemorrhoids and anal fissures:Take a sitz bath several times a day by immersing your bottom in warm water for about 10 to 15 minutes. You can buy a sitz bath, a portable basin that fits in the toilet, or you can simply fill your bathtub with a few inches of warm water. (Don't add any soaps or bubble baths.)Relaxing your anal muscles during the soak will help maximize the blood flow  and healing  in the area. Learning how to relax these muscles may also help make bowel movements less painful.To identify these muscles, simply contract the same muscles you use to stop urinating or having a bowel movement and then relax them, as you would when doing Kegel exercises. Do this a few times while you're taking your sitz bath.Do Kegel exercises when you're not in the tub, too, to help strengthen and tone the muscles around the vagina and urethra, which will aid in postpartum recovery.For hemorrhoids, some women find comfort with an ice pack or cold compresses soaked in witch hazel, while others swear by a heating pad. Try alternating hot and cold treatments: Start with an ice pack followed by a warm sitz bath.Use soft, white, unscented toilet tissue, which causes less irritation than varieties that are colored or scented. Moistening the tissue can help, too. Or use moist towelettes saturated with witch hazel instead.Ask your healthcare practitioner to recommend a safe topical anesthetic or, for hemorrhoids, a medicated suppository. (Note: If you've had an episiotomy or tear that extends into your rectum, it's especially important not to put anything  including suppositories  into your rectum until you're given the okay by your healthcare provider.)There are many such products on the market, but most should be used for a short course of treatment only (a week or less). Continued use can cause even more inflammation.For temporary relief, you can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen, even if you're breastfeeding. (Do not, however, use aspirin or products containing aspirin if you're a nursing mom.) Don't take more than the recommended amount, and if the pain continues, talk to your midwife or doctor.Is postpartum rectal bleeding ever a sign of a serious problem?Not usually, but it can be, so be sure to let your caregiver know about it.Bleeding caused by hemorrhoids usually stops on its own, particularly if you make changes to keep constipation at bay. In severe cases, though, you may be referred to a specialist for treatment, which may include minor surgery. Likewise, if you have anal fissures that aren't healing, your midwife or doctor can refer you to a specialist for help."
Bottle-feeding basics for formula-fed babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_bottle-feeding-basics-for-formula-fed-babies_14286.bc,"How often should I feed my baby?As with breastfeeding, most experts agree that you shouldn't follow a rigid schedule in the early weeks, though you may be able to work out an approximate pattern for feeding within a month or so. Offer a bottle every two to three hours at first, or as your baby seems hungry.When your baby is about a month old, she'll be ready to eat on a schedule. Formula-fed infants tend to be heavier than breastfed babies, so following a feeding schedule can help prevent them from overeating.Feed your baby once every three to four hours. Until she reaches about 10 pounds, she'll probably take 1.5 to 3 ounces per feeding. Don't force her to take more than she seems ready to eat. Your baby's doctor can advise you about how much your baby should eat as she grows.Do I need to sterilize the bottles?Doctors used to advise sterilizing bottle-feeding supplies back when the safety of water supplies was less reliable. This isn't as much of a concern now, but it's best to play it safe and ask your child's doctor if she thinks sterilization is necessary.If your doctor recommends sterilizing your supplies before the first use, submerge new bottles, nipples, and rings in a pot of boiling water for at least five minutes. Then let them air dry on a clean towel. After that, a good hand-washing with soapy water or a cycle through the dishwasher is sufficient. (You can find handy bottle gear  such as drying racks and dishwasher baskets for nipples, rings, and bottle caps  online or at baby supply stores.)Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.If you have well water, or if your local health department says your tap water is unsafe for drinking, you'll probably need to sterilize bottles before every use.A note about plastics: Some studies have found that plastic baby bottles contain chemicals which may leach into the formula, especially when the bottle is heated. You can avoid this risk by using bottles made of stainless steel or glass. If you decide to use plastic bottles, don't boil them, heat them in the microwave, or wash them in the dishwasher. Instead, hand wash them with a bottle brush and warm, soapy water. Learn more about the safety of plastic baby bottles.Do I need to sterilize my drinking water for making formula?Many parents do sterilize the water used to mix formula, especially in the newborn months, but you don't need to unless your child's doctor recommends it. However, if you use well water or your tap water is unsafe for drinking, you'll need to sterilize it or use bottled water for mixing formula.If you do choose to boil the water you use to mix formula, save yourself time by preparing enough in the morning for the whole day. Bring cold water to a rolling boil and let it boil for just one minute. Let it cool to room temperature for no longer than 30 minutes, mix enough formula for the next 24 hours, and refrigerate it immediately. Discard any formula that isn't used within 24 hours.What's the best way to warm a bottle?There's no health reason to warm formula, though your baby may prefer it. When you're ready to feed your baby, you can warm a bottle in a bowl of hot  not boiling  water, or by running it under the tap. You can also buy a bottle warmer designed for this purpose. Always test the formula by shaking a few drops on the inside of your wrist to make sure it's not too hot for your baby.If your baby is accustomed to drinking bottles at room temperature or slightly cold, you save yourself the time and hassle of preheating bottles, especially when she's crying to be fed right now.Caution: Never use a microwave to heat a bottle of formula. A microwave heats unevenly, so it can create hot pockets and lead to burns. Microwave heating can also cause the nutrients in formula to break down. Also, if you use plastic bottles, warm formula by putting the bottle in a bowl of warm  not hot  water or run it under warm water.For more bottle-feeding basics, visit these articles:Choosing nipples and bottles for formula feedingHow much formula your baby needsBreastfeeding and supplementing with formulaHow to use baby formula safelyShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

"My breastfeeding story: Pain and low supply, then big improvement",https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-pain-and-low-supply-then-big-improvem_10414444.bc,"Name: PriyaLives in: Rutherford, New JerseyBreastfeeding experience: Tough at first, then got easierMain challenges: Pain, low supply, baby started to prefer bottleBreastfed for: 12 monthsMy storyMy mom breastfed me until I was 13 months so I always thought, ""Okay, my mom did it, so I should do it."" I took a breastfeeding class and I thought, ""I can do this.""But it was tough. I remember we went to the doctor in the first week because my daughter was crying a lot, and her pediatrician said, ""She's hungry,"" and suggested I formula-feed. My supply was low. I felt like a failure. Everyone has their ideas before they have the baby, and I thought breastfeeding wouldn't be hard, but it turned out to be hard for me.With the doctor's orders, I tried to let go of some of my feelings of inadequacy and started supplementing with formula anytime it seemed like my daughter wasn't getting enough milk. I'd give her maybe 2 ounces of formula at a time, at most.Another problem was that, in the beginning, breastfeeding was very painful for me. I had bleeding nipples. In fact, one of my nipples was so scarred within two weeks of leaving the hospital that I wasn't letting my daughter feed on that side. I was just pumping. In retrospect, I wasn't nursing my daughter as much as I would have otherwise because I was so fearful about the pain.6 things you'll need for breastfeeding Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:27Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:27Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Learn which items can bring relief to cracked nipples, leaking breasts, and other nursing challenges. See all videosAnd when my daughter was a month old, I got mastitis. I had flu-like symptoms and a fever and I was like, ""What the heck?"" I texted my friends who'd had babies, and they were like, ""Oh, that's mastitis!"" I went to the doctor, and he gave me a prescription for antibiotics. When I took them, my supply went down, and I was freaking out.But once I hit the five-week mark, things got better. The breastfeeding wasn't painful anymore, and I started enjoying it. By two months in, I was able to completely stop using formula. It's been exclusively breast milk since then. I just kept working at it. One day it was like, ""Oh this doesn't hurt! We can both enjoy it now.""However, by the time my daughter was 3 or 4 months old, she'd been getting the bottle enough that she started preferring it to the breast. Every time I'd offer the breast, she'd cry and wouldn't eat as much. But she was hungry.So from then on, I ended up exclusively pumping and bottle-feeding her my milk. I kind of missed nursing, but it wasn't working for us. And I recognized that breast milk was important for her overall growth and health, so I made a commitment to pumping.One good thing about pumping from early on is that I was able to build up a stash that went into the freezer. And that was helpful to have because during the times that my supply has temporarily dropped  like each time I get my period  I've been able to use that milk for my daughter. Her appetite is huge.I have my own office, so pumping at work isn't an issue, and I have two pumps  one at work and one at home. I don't take lunches now; I just use that time to pump. I do it five to six times a day. It's so easy, how could I not continue? I told myself I was going to do it until my daughter's first birthday, and now that that's almost here, I'm about ready to stop. I plan on switching her to whole cow's milk.My biggest lesson learnedAt the end of the day, you have to do what's right for you. For me, it was pumping and bottle-feeding until the one-year mark, and I'm working my hardest to fulfill that. One thing that really helped me is that I had a couple of friends who nursed and pumped for a whole year. And I thought: If they can do it, I can do it.Back to all breastfeeding essays"

If you follow your healthcare provider's advice before you conceive, throughout pregnancy, and after delivery, the risk of passing HIV to your baby is about 1 percent or less.HIV is transmitted through bodily fluids including blood, vaginal fluids, and breast milk, so there's a chance of passing the virus on to your baby during pregnancy, labor and delivery, or when breastfeeding. However, the number of babies infected this way has declined significantly since the early 1990s due to advances in HIV research, prevention, screening, and early treatment.Do I need to see my doctor before trying to conceive?Yes. Talk to your healthcare provider before becoming pregnant. There's a lot you can do to have a healthy pregnancy and reduce the risk of passing on the infection to your partner and baby. Taking the right medications before and during pregnancy reduces the risk of viral transmission to the baby.If you're on antiretroviral therapy (ART), you may need to change your drug regimen before conception. Not all ART drugs are safe to take during pregnancy, so work out a plan with your provider.For example, the drug efavirenz is linked to birth defects in babies when it's taken early in pregnancy, so a provider will only recommend it in the first trimester if there's no other alternative. It's dangerous to stop taking medication suddenly, so talk with your provider first.Once your provider reviews your ART regimen and gives you the go-ahead to get pregnant, follow the regimen carefully. Forgetting to take medication, or taking it at the wrong time, puts you at risk of increasing the level of HIV in your body or having the drug mutate into a drug-resistant strain of HIV that's difficult to treat.The goal of treatment before pregnancy is to lower the virus to an undetectable level before conception. This is determined by a blood test that measures the viral load in copies per milliliter (copies/mL). If it's below a certain level (usually between 40 and 75 copies/mL), it's considered undetectable.Once on ART, it's possible to have an undetectable viral load within six months.Besides taking HIV medication, how do I prepare for pregnancy?Ask your provider to help you to improve your pre-pregnancy health:Take folic acid. All pregnant women need a daily vitamin supplement that contains 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily, starting at least a month before getting pregnant. Folic acid prevents defects of the brain and spine in babies.Get vaccinated. Important pre-pregnancy immunizations include vaccinations for hepatitis A, hepatitis B, pneumococcus, and influenza.Stop smoking, drinking alcohol, or abusing drugs. If needed, your provider can help you get treatment.Practice safe sex. Condoms can prevent sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and protect your partner from HIV.Can I get pregnant without putting my partner at risk?Yes, you can. But it's necessary to take precautions because there's a risk your partner could contract the virus through unprotected sex.Artificial insemination is the safest way to conceive. This can be done at home with a syringe when you ovulate, though you'll need to keep track of your cycle so you know when you're most fertile.Some couples want to conceive naturally. If you choose to do this, minimize the risk of HIV infection by taking ART and waiting until your viral load is undetectable. In addition, your provider may recommend a form of ART to your partner called pre-exposure prophylaxis (or PrEP). Then time unprotected sex with the most fertile days in your cycle.Will I have trouble conceiving?No one knows for sure if HIV causes fertility problems. Some studies report fertility problems in HIV-positive women. Other studies have found that being HIV positive doesn't make a difference.It could be that another condition associated with HIV causes a fertility problem. For example, if you are HIV positive, you're at higher risk of other sexually transmitted infections (STIs), which sometimes make conception more difficult.If you haven't already been tested for other STIs, see your provider. As with all moms-to-be, it's important to avoid STIs during pregnancy, so use condoms during sex.Ask your provider to refer you to a fertility specialist with experience treating people with HIV if you're struggling to conceive.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2012.

My breastfeeding story: Didn't put too much pressure on myself,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-didnt-put-too-much-pressure-on-myself_10419218.bc,"Name: KatieLives in: Sommerville, MassachusettsBreastfeeding experience: Did what she could, supplemented with formula, happy with how things wentMain challenges: Inverted nipples, lack of support from family, uneven milk supplyBreastfed for: 11 monthsMy storyI went to a breastfeeding class before giving birth so I could understand the process. It didn't seem all that hard but I wasn't 100 percent sold on its benefits. I basically went into it thinking: This is the cheapest thing to do, and it's a good thing to do. And if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.I found that breastfeeding was both easy and hard. Watching my newborn son, Jesse, move down to my breast to nurse was amazing. But I worried because I have inverted nipples. I'd already asked some lactation consultants about it and they told me I might need to do some extra work to breastfeed successfully.In the hospital, the first lactation consultant I saw gave me a nipple shield, which helped. I still remember the pain I felt in my shoulders because I was tense and stressed out about how to hold Jesse and get him to latch on. I felt like I needed to do it exactly right.I was producing more from the right breast than the left  three times as much. Given this and my inverted nipples, I continued to have questions for lactation consultants. I saw one at my son's pediatrician's office and another at my OB's office. It was helpful because each had different advice that I could try.My family was supportive of breastfeeding, until it got hard. Within the first week my mother said, ""Maybe you should try some formula."" And then by three weeks, my sister and my father started saying, ""Maybe there's something wrong with your milk.""I eventually did use formula  about two bottles a day. It gave me a bit of a break.I went back to work when Jesse was 3.5 months, and I pumped three times a day. I have an office to pump in, so I'm lucky that way.By then we started traveling a lot, too. My mother was seriously ill and we flew down to Kentucky every month. We'd stay with family and schedules were up in the air. I had been strict about Jesse's feeding schedule but couldn't keep it up. He didn't want to nurse as much when we were in Kentucky. I think he was just too distracted. So he began nursing for shorter periods of time and eventually he was nursing fewer times every day.One day when he was 11 months old we were lying in bed and I tried to feed him. He went to latch on and then reared back with a disgusted look on his face. I had this moment of feeling hurt and rejected but it was also funny, so I was like, ""Okay, I get it. We're done."" I bottle-fed for a few weeks after that but we were already well on our way to transitioning to a sippy cup.My biggest lesson learnedBreastfeeding had its challenges and I don't know how I got to the part where it was easy. Getting advice from lactation consultants helped. Just go with it and don't expect too much or have too many rules for yourself.Back to all breastfeeding essays"
Fertility problem: Premature ovarian failure,https://www.babycenter.com/0_fertility-problem-premature-ovarian-failure_10419292.bc,"What is premature ovarian failure?Premature ovarian failure (POF) is when you stop ovulating regularly before age 40. It's also known as primary or premature ovarian insufficiency.If you have POF, you ovulate less and less frequently, and your periods become irregular. This can go on for months or even years before your ovaries stop releasing eggs altogether. POF can cause menopause-like symptoms and make it difficult to get pregnant.Your risk of the condition increases with age. POF affects about:1 in 10,000 women by age 201 in 1,000 women by age 301 in 250 women by age 351 in 100 women by age 40What's the difference between POF and early menopause?The two terms are often used interchangeably, and both refer to conditions that happen to women younger than 40.If you have POF, you still ovulate sporadically. Women in early menopause have stopped ovulating completely.(The average age for women to be in menopause is 51, and you're technically not in menopause until you've gone a full year without having a period.)What causes POF?The cause is unknown in about 90 percent of cases. Known possible causes include chemotherapy, radiation, genetic disorders (such as Turner's syndrome), and some autoimmune disorders.What are the symptoms of POF?The most common symptom is having irregular periods. If you haven't had a period for three months in a row, see your doctor.You may also have hot flashes, vaginal dryness, decreased sex drive, irritability, mood disturbances, night sweats, and trouble sleeping.How is POF diagnosed?At your appointment, your doctor will do a physical exam and may order blood tests to rule out pregnancy and any genetic disorders that could cause POF. Your levels of reproductive hormones  such as follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and estrogen  will also be checked.Can I still get pregnant with POF?Yes, it's possible. About 5 to 10 percent of women with POF are able to get pregnant without fertility treatment.If it doesn't happen for you naturally, you might consider in vitro fertilization (IVF) with donor eggs. One study showed a 90 percent success rate in women with POF after three cycles of IVF.If you have POF as a result of chemo or radiation, you may go into what's called ""spontaneous remission."" That means your ovaries start to work again without intervention. (The younger you were during treatment, the more likely this is to happen.)Other studies found that taking dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) may help women with POF get pregnant. However, the studies are limited, so DHEA is considered an experimental treatment until more well-designed, large-scale studies are done.How can I cope with my feelings about having POF?Dealing with fertility problems associated with POF can be stressful, or even devastating. Professional support from a counselor with expertise in treating women who have experienced infertility can help you cope.See our articles on coping with infertility.Can POF cause other health problems?Although your fertility may be your main concern, POF can have other health consequences. For example, when you have POF, your ovaries don't make as much estrogen as usual. Your body needs estrogen for strong bones, so your doctor may test your bone mineral density and suggest taking calcium and vitamin D supplements each day to maintain bone strength.Estrogen also protects your heart by keeping blood vessels flexible, which helps blood flow through them smoothly. Estrogen may protect against Alzheimer's disease, high cholesterol, and stroke as well.Because estrogen plays such an important role in so many body functions, your doctor may suggest hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to supply your body with the hormones your ovaries aren't making anymore.You may have heard that HRT can increase the risk of heart disease. However, a large study found that only women who took hormones years after going through menopause showed an increased risk.Whether HRT is right for you depends on many factors, including your risk of hormone-related cancers (such as breast, ovarian, and uterine) and how severe your symptoms are.If you go on HRT, you'll probably begin to have regular periods again, and it's likely you'll get relief from menopausal symptoms, like hot flashes, night sweats, insomnia, painful intercourse, mood disturbances, and vaginal dryness. You may also maintain bone health and reduce your risk of heart disease.Your doctor may suggest that you stay on HRT until you're about 50, which is around the age that women typically go through menopause.Note: Anita Sadaty, attending ob-gyn at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, New York, contributed to this article.Show sources Hide sources ASRM. 2011.

Hemorrhoids during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_hemorrhoids-during-pregnancy_244.bc,"What are hemorrhoids?Hemorrhoids are blood vessels in the rectal area that have become unusually swollen. They typically range from the size of a pea to the size of a grape and can be inside the rectum or protrude through the anus.Hemorrhoids can be itchy and mildly uncomfortable  or downright painful. Sometimes they can even cause rectal bleeding, especially during a bowel movement.Hemorrhoids are common during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. Some women get them for the first time while they're pregnant. And if you've had them before pregnancy, you're quite likely to have them again now. They may also develop while you're pushing during the second stage of labor and are a common early postpartum complaint.In most cases, hemorrhoids that developed during pregnancy will begin to resolve soon after you give birth, especially if you're careful to avoid constipation.Why are they more common during pregnancy?Pregnancy makes you more prone to hemorrhoids, as well as to varicose veins in the legs and sometimes even in the vulva, for a variety of reasons. Your growing uterus puts pressure on the pelvic veins and the inferior vena cava, a large vein on the right side of the body that receives blood from the lower limbs. This can slow the return of blood from the lower half of your body, which increases the pressure on the veins below your uterus and causes them to become more dilated or swollen.Constipation, another common problem during pregnancy, can also cause or aggravate hemorrhoids. That's because straining leads to hemorrhoids, and you tend to strain when having a hard bowel movement.In addition, an increase in the hormone progesterone during pregnancy causes the walls of your veins to relax, allowing them to swell more easily. Progesterone also contributes to constipation by slowing down your intestinal tract. Tips for constipation during pregnancyWhat causes constipation, and how can you prevent it?How can I avoid getting hemorrhoids?You're more susceptible to hemorrhoids when pregnant, but they're not inevitable. Here are some ways to ward them off  or get rid of them if you do get them:First and foremost, avoid constipation: Eat a high-fiber diet (plenty of whole grains, beans, fruits, and vegetables), drink plenty of water (eight to ten glasses a day), and get regular exercise, even if you only have time for a short, brisk walk. If you're constipated, ask your practitioner about using a fiber supplement or stool softener.Don't wait when you have the urge to have a bowel movement, try not to strain when you're moving your bowels, and don't linger on the toilet, because it puts pressure on the area.Do Kegel exercises daily. Kegels increase circulation in the rectal area and strengthen the muscles around the anus, decreasing the chance of hemorrhoids. They also strengthen and tone the muscles around the vagina and urethra, which can help your body recover after you give birth.Avoid sitting or standing for long stretches of time. If your job involves sitting, get up and move around for a few minutes every hour or so. At home, lie on your left side when sleeping, reading, or watching TV to take the pressure off your rectal veins and help increase blood return from the lower half of your body.What else can I do to get relief?Apply an ice pack (with a soft covering) to the affected area several times a day. Ice may help decrease swelling and discomfort. Some women find cold compresses saturated with witch hazel to be soothing.Soak your bottom in warm water in a tub for 10 to 15 minutes a few times each day. (If you don't have a tub, you can buy a sitz bath at the drugstore. It's a small plastic basin that you fill with water and position over your toilet, allowing you to submerge your rectal area simply by sitting down.)Try alternating cold and warm treatments.Gently but thoroughly clean the affected area after each bowel movement using soft, unscented, white toilet tissue, which causes less irritation than colored, scented varieties.Moistening the tissue can help, too. Many women find using premoistened wipes more comfortable than using toilet tissue. You can buy wipes medicated with witch hazel that are made specifically for people with hemorrhoids.Ask your healthcare practitioner to recommend a safe topical anesthetic or medicated suppository. There are many hemorrhoid-relief products on the market, but consult your practitioner before trying one on your own. Most of these products should be used for no more than a week. Continued use can cause even more inflammation.When should I call my practitioner?If your own preventive and relief efforts don't help  or if you have severe pain or notice bleeding  consult your doctor or midwife. (Any rectal bleeding should be checked by your practitioner.)For most women, hemorrhoids will get better after delivery with the help of these self-treatment measures. In some cases, you may need to see a specialist for treatment to help shrink your hemorrhoids. Rarely, minor surgery is required to correct the problem.

Bottle-feeding basics,https://www.babycenter.com/0_bottle-feeding-basics_752.bc,"How often should I feed my baby?Most experts agree that you shouldn't follow a rigid feeding schedule in the early weeks, though you may be able to work out an approximate pattern within a month or two.Offer your breast or the bottle every two to three hours at first or as your baby seems hungry. Until your baby reaches about 10 pounds, she'll probably take one to three ounces per feeding.Don't force more than she seems ready to eat.

See all videosDo I need to sterilize the bottles?Before you first use new bottles, nipples, and rings, sterilize them by submerging them in a pot of boiling water for at least five minutes. Then let them air dry on a clean towel. After that, a good cleaning in hot, soapy water or a cycle through the dishwasher is sufficient.Two exceptions: One, if you have well water, it may be best to continue sterilizing the bottles. And two, to minimize exposure to harmful chemicals, don't boil plastic baby bottles, heat them in the microwave, or wash them in the dishwasher.Plastic bottles are made with bisphenol A and other chemicals that are released when heated. When these chemicals are released, they may end up in your baby's milk or formula.You can find handy bottle-feeding gear, such as bottle drying racks and dishwasher baskets for nipples, rings, and bottle caps, at most baby supply stores.Find out how to choose bottles and nipples and when to replace them.Guide to Firsts: Bottle feeding7 keys to feeding your baby with a bottle.Can I mix breast milk and formula?There's nothing wrong with mixing breast milk and formula in the same container, but it's not recommended simply because you don't want to waste a single drop of your precious breast milk if you're pumping and supplementing with formula. A good plan is to feed your baby whatever breast milk you've expressed, and then follow that up with an ounce or two of formula if you need it. Find out more.What's the best way to warm a bottle?There's no health reason to warm the milk first, but your baby may prefer it. When you're ready to feed your baby, you can heat up the bottle in a bowl of warm  not hot or boiling  water, or by running it under the tap. You can also buy a bottle warmer designed for this purpose.If your baby is accustomed to drinking bottles at room temperature or slightly cold, you save yourself the time and hassle of preheating bottles, especially when she's crying to be fed.Never use a microwave to heat a bottle of breast milk or formula. A microwave oven heats unevenly, so it can create hot pockets and lead to burns. It can also cause nutrients to break down.How can I make sure my baby is drinking comfortably?Like so much with babies, you'll need to listen and observe. If you hear a lot of noisy sucking sounds while she drinks, she may be taking in too much air. To help your baby swallow less air, hold her at a 45-degree angle. Also take care to tilt the bottle so that the nipple and neck are always filled with breast milk or formula.Never prop a bottle - it can cause your baby to choke. Besides, bottle-feeding, like breastfeeding, can be a wonderful time for nurturing your baby by holding her close. So take feeding time as an opportunity to snuggle and bond.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011a. Amount and schedule of formula feedings.

Black women and pregnancy: Sickle cell disease,https://www.babycenter.com/0_black-women-and-pregnancy-sickle-cell-disease_10326270.bc,"What is sickle cell disease?Sickle cell disease is an inherited blood disorder. There are several forms of the disease  the most common is sickle cell anemia. While a person of nearly any race can have sickle cell anemia, most cases in the United States occur among African Americans.Hemoglobin is a protein found in every red blood cell. It enables red blood cells to carry oxygen from your lungs to all parts of your body. If you have sickle cell disease, your body produces only abnormal hemoglobin, known as hemoglobin S.Healthy red blood cells containing normal hemoglobin are round and smooth, and they can move easily through blood vessels. Blood cells containing hemoglobin S can become rigid, elongated, and crescent-shaped (like the farm tool called a sickle). If this happens, they aren't able to squeeze through small blood vessels.When sickled cells get trapped and clump together, they can build up in various organs and tissues throughout the body, leading to intense pain. This is sometimes called a sickle cell crisis.Some people with sickle cell disease have pain only occasionally, while others have pain fairly frequently. Sometimes the pain is relatively mild and can be treated at home. At other times the pain can be severe enough to require admission to a hospital for pain control and intravenous fluids.What are the effects of sickle cell disease?Pain episodes are the most common symptom of sickle cell disease, but the disease can lead to other health problems including anemia, kidney failure, heart failure, and blindness.People with sickle cell disease have trouble fighting infections because the condition can damage the spleen. Pneumonia, meningitis, influenza, and hepatitis are all more common in people who have sickle cell anemia.How does sickle cell disease affect pregnancy?Sickle cell disease often becomes more severe  and pain episodes more frequent  during pregnancy, particularly in the third trimester. A pregnant woman with sickle cell disease is more likely to have a miscarriage, preterm labor, or a low-birth-weight baby. Sickle cell pregnancies are almost always considered high risk.Ideally, women with sickle cell disease should receive preconception counseling. With early prenatal care and careful monitoring, women with sickle cell disease can have a healthy pregnancy and successful delivery.How do you get sickle cell disease?The sickle cell gene is passed down  from parents to child. To inherit the disease, you have to receive two sickle hemoglobin genes, one from each of your parents.If you inherit the sickle hemoglobin gene from one parent and a normal hemoglobin gene from the other parent, you have what's called sickle cell trait. One in 12 African Americans  and 1 in 100 Hispanic Americans  has sickle cell trait.People with sickle cell trait carry the gene for sickle cell, but they don't suffer from the disease. Their bodies make both normal hemoglobin and sickle cell hemoglobin, but they're generally as healthy as people who don't have the trait.If you have the disease, your child will inherit a sickle hemoglobin gene from you. If you have sickle cell trait, however, you could pass either a sickle hemoglobin gene or a normal hemoglobin gene to your child. When two people with sickle cell trait have a child, their child may inherit two normal genes, one normal and one sickle hemoglobin gene, or two sickle cell genes.Is there more than one type of sickle cell disease?These are most common forms of sickle cell disease:Hemoglobin SS, or sickle cell anemia: A person inherits one sickle hemoglobin gene from each parent. This is the most common and usually most severe form.Hemoglobin SC, or sickle C disease: A person inherits one sickle hemoglobin gene and one gene for another abnormal type of hemoglobin called C. Generally, pregnant women with sickle C face the same complications as women with sickle cell anemia, but their symptoms tend to be milder. Women with sickle C generally have better pregnancy outcomes than women with sickle cell anemia.Hemoglobin S-beta thalassemia: A person inherits one sickle hemoglobin gene and one gene for beta thalassemia, another inherited anemia.Why is it especially important for black women to know about sickle cell disease?Sickle cell is the most common genetic disorder among African Americans. In the United States, about 1 in 500 African Americans has sickle cell anemia, while the disease affects 1 in 5,000 of all Americans. The disease is also common among Hispanic Americans  1 in every 1,000 to 1,400. (Sickle cell disease isn't prevalent among Asians.)""All African American women should be screened for sickle cell,"" says Andrea Jackson, an ob-gyn at the Physician & Midwife Collaborative in Alexandria, Virginia. It is essential because sickle cell is very prevalent in most people of color, from American blacks to Caribbeans to people of Mediterranean descent. Be very proactive in obtaining your sickle cell status. Be tested for all the variants of the disease.""Why is sickle cell more common in certain races and ethnic groups?The genetic change that resulted in sickle hemoglobin originated in Africa and the Indian-Saudi Arabian subcontinent. Researchers believe the mutation was able to spread in these regions because the sickle cell gene helps protect people from malaria. If people who carry the sickle hemoglobin gene are more likely to survive being infected with malaria, they will live to pass that gene on to their children.Sickle cell exists in all countries of Africa, particularly in West and Central Africa, where as many as 25 percent of the people have sickle cell trait, and in areas where Africans have migrated, which explains the high prevalence among African Americans.The sickle hemoglobin gene was introduced to the Americas through the transatlantic slave trade. Similarly, slavery, ethnic migrations, and the Moorish invasion of southern Europe spread the sickle gene from Africa to southern Europe, which explains why it's prevalent among Portuguese, Spaniards, French Corsicans, Sardinians, Sicilians, mainland Italians, Greeks, Turks, and Cypriots.Today, the disease is most common in people whose families come from Africa, the Caribbean Islands, South or Central America, Mediterranean countries (such as Greece, Italy, and Turkey), India, and the Middle East (such as Saudi Arabia).What are the risks of sickle cell disease during pregnancy?Women with sickle cell are more prone to pain episodes during pregnancy, especially during the third trimester. Pregnancy creates intense demands on a woman's body, and the normal physiologic changes of pregnancy  and common complications like anemia can easily make the sickling of red blood cells worse.If blood vessels become blocked by sickled cells, body tissues may be deprived of oxygen and die. Even minor areas of damage in the placenta may reduce the amount of oxygen and nutrients available for the baby's growth in the womb.Additional complications for the mother may include:Infections, including urinary tract infection, pneumonia, and uterine infection, which can all lead to pain episodesGallbladder problems, including gallstonesHeart enlargement and heart failure from anemiaAdditional complications for the baby may include:MiscarriagePreterm birthLow birth weightStillbirthHow is sickle cell disease managed during pregnancy?You and your doctor should work together to make sure you have a healthy baby. ""The disease can be managed successfully, but it does require a high level of expertise,"" says Andrea Jackson.First, you'll need an obstetrician who specializes in high-risk pregnancies (called a perinatologist) and a blood specialist (hematologist). It makes sense to meet with your pregnancy caregiver for a preconception appointment.If you take hydroxyurea to prevent pain episodes, your doctor will probably recommend that you avoid it when you're pregnant, and maybe even when you're trying to conceive. Studies indicate that it can increase the risk of birth defects.Once you're pregnant, you'll have frequent prenatal doctor visits, which will include regular blood and urine tests. Jackson says it's important to check for any bacteria in the urine. ""We treat any sign of infection quickly to prevent it from reaching up to the bladder and kidneys, which can cause preterm labor,"" she says.At your first prenatal visit, your initial tests may include a complete blood count, hemoglobin electrophoresis (for your partner as well), liver function tests, a test for hepatitis B and C, blood group and antibody typing, a test for rubella antibodies, and a syphilis test.Pregnant women who have sickle cell anemia are almost always found to be anemic at the first prenatal visit. The anemia is typically caused by hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) rather than iron deficiency, so iron supplements won't help. Blood transfusions are the typical treatment.Some sickle cell patients may be overloaded with iron because of frequent past blood transfusions. They may be advised to avoid iron supplements but would still benefit from prenatal vitamins.Morning sickness poses extra risks for women who have sickle cell, as it can lead to dehydration, which can cause a pain episode.During the last trimester you may have additional fetal testing. Anemia is likely to be most severe during the final months of pregnancy and may require blood transfusions.Can I have a regular delivery if I have sickle cell disease?Women with sickle cell disease can deliver vaginally, unless complications arise. In fact, vaginal delivery is preferred since c-sections present a higher risk of blood loss, infection, and pulmonary embolism (a blood clot that goes to your lungs).During labor, your team of specialists will take great care to prevent a pain episode. You'll probably receive intravenous (IV) fluids to help prevent dehydration as well as extra oxygen through a mask. A fetal heart rate monitor is often used to watch for changes in heart rate and signs of fetal distress.After delivery, drink plenty of fluids to help prevent dehydration. Take special care of any stitches or incisions to prevent infection.What can I do to take care of myself and prevent pain episodes while I'm pregnant?The general care guidelines for a person with sickle cell disease are even more important during pregnancy. These tips will help you keep pain episodes at bay.Take folic acid. Follow your doctor's recommendations for a healthy diet, including taking a folic acid supplement every day. In addition to helping prevent neural tube defects, folic acid will help your bone marrow make new red blood cells.Drink plenty of water. Try to get at least eight glasses of water a day  especially in warm weather  to keep your body well hydrated.Get plenty of sleep. Talk to your doctor if you are having trouble sleeping or staying asleep.Avoid extremes of heat and cold. Extreme temperatures can cause cells to sickle. Bundle up whether you're outside in cold weather or in a chilly air-conditioned room. Avoid swimming in cold water.Avoid other extreme conditions. While you're not going to take up mountain climbing or scuba diving while pregnant, you might want to be cautious about other situations that involve high altitudes and low oxygen, like flying or traveling to cities at high elevation.Reduce stress. If you're feeling overwhelmed or depressed, talk to your doctor. Studies indicate that stress can trigger sickle cell pain episodes. It may be helpful to find a support group, such as the BabyCenter Community's Sickle Cell Moms and Dads group, to help you cope with daily life.Prevent infections. Talk to your doctor about getting the flu shot and make sure you're up-to-date with other vaccines. Contact your doctor if you have any signs of an infection, such as fever or trouble breathing.Can I be tested for sickle cell disease or sickle cell trait before getting pregnant?Yes, you can get a blood test to find out whether you have sickle cell disease or trait.If you have sickle cell disease, you almost certainly know it. But you might not know whether you're carrying the trait, and since 1 in 12 African Americans are carriers, it's important to get checked.If your blood shows an abnormality, your baby's father should be tested as well. If you, but not the father, have the trait, there's no chance that your child will have sickle cell disease. But if both you and your partner have the trait, you need to understand the risks for your child.If both you and your partner have sickle cell trait, here are the odds:50 percent that your child will have the trait25 percent that your child will have sickle cell disease25 percent that your child will have neither the trait nor the diseaseCan sickle cell disease be detected in my baby before birth?Prenatal testing can detect whether your baby has sickle cell disease, sickle cell trait, or neither. As early as the first trimester, doctors can take a sample of placental tissue (chorionic villus sampling, or CVS) to detect whether your baby has the genes that would lead to the disease or trait. After 17 weeks, amniocentesis can determine this information from the amniotic fluid.Prenatal test: Chorionic villus sampling (CVS) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:33Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:33Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosWill my baby be tested for sickle cell disease after birth?All states screen newborns for certain genetic diseases and other conditions  including sickle cell disease. This test is usually done on the second or third day of life by taking drops of blood from your baby's heel.Results are available in several weeks, and in most states they're sent to the birth hospital and your baby's doctor. Some states also send information directly to the mother. Ask your baby's doctor to look up the results and explain them to you at one of the postnatal visits.For more information and tips on what to do if your baby is diagnosed with sickle cell disease in utero or after birth, read our article on sickle cell anemia in children."
Top cold and flu myths – and the facts on keeping your child healthy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_top-cold-and-flu-myths-160-8211-and-the-facts-on-keeping-you_1448773.bc,"A typical child will catch five to eight colds this year  maybe more, if friends or siblings are around sharing their germs. Throw in a bout with the flu, and your little one could spend a lot of time sniffling, sneezing, and feeling miserable.While you can't entirely germ-proof your child, you can learn to separate fact from fiction, keep your family healthier, and save time, money, and frustration. Start by putting some of the more common myths and misunderstandings to rest. And be sure to check out our article onhome remedies.Myth 1: Over-the-counter cough and cold remedies work well for children.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says over-the-counter medicines for relieving stuffiness, runny noses, and coughs are not effective for kids younger than 6, and can have harmful side effects. If your child is under 6, soothe his symptoms with childrens acetaminophen or ibuprofen and safe home remedies.A 2004 study, for example, found that common medicated cough syrups worked no better than the same amount of unmedicated syrup. And a 2007 study found that honey worked better than cough syrup for kids 2 and older.OTC medicines can also be dangerous, especially when a child mistakenly gets more than the recommended dose.In addition to side effects like drowsiness or sleeplessness, upset stomach, and a rash or hives, kids can suffer serious effects such as rapid heart rate, convulsions, and even death. Every year, 7,000 children under the age of 11 are treated in U.S. emergency rooms after taking too much cough or cold medication.How do accidental overdoses happen?Self-medicating kids:As any emergency room worker will tell you, children find medicine and take it without adult supervision.What you can do:Keep all medicines out of reach in childproof containers.Too many cooks:Two or more adults (say, a parent and a babysitter) medicate a child without telling each other.What you can do:Make sure every caregiver knows whose job it is to give it your child medicine, and when. You may want to attach a schedule to the bottle with a signoff spot for each dose.Dueling medicines:A child receives a dose of more than one medicine with the same active ingredient.What you can do:Read labels carefully, noting what the active ingredients are, and don't give your child two medicines with similar active ingredients. This includes decongestants, cough suppressants, expectorants, antihistamines,acetaminophen, andibuprofen.Measuring mistakes:One study found that 70 percent of parents have trouble getting the dose right.What you can do:Carefully measure the dosage as directed, using the measuring device included with the medicine.Find out more aboutGiving kidsOTC cough and cold medicinesAlternatives to medicine:Safe home remediesTreating your baby'scoldorfluTreating your toddler'scoldorfluTreating your preschooler'scoldorfluTreating your older child'scoldorfluGiving medicines safelyand effectivelyMyth 2: Antibiotics can kill the germs that cause colds and the flu.Treating a cold or flu with antibiotics is like using nose drops to treat a hangnail. That's because antibiotics kill bacteria, and colds and flu are caused by viruses, a class of germs that aren't anything like bacteria.Healthcare providers work hard to dispel this myth, but it just won't go away. Worried parents pressure doctors for antibiotics to help their children feel better, but facts are facts: No antibiotic from Amoxil to Zithromax will help a cold or flu.Lack of effectiveness isn't the only reason to avoid unnecessary antibiotics. The drugs can have unpleasant side effects such as diarrhea and stomach cramps. And disease-causing bacteria can gradually build up a resistance to the drugs, making actual bacterial infections harder to treat.On the other hand, if your child develops a complication of a cold or flu that involves bacteria, an antibiotic may prove helpful. This might be the case if she develops an ear infection, bronchitis, or pneumonia, for example.Myth 3: There's really no difference between the flu and a bad cold.It can be hard to tell the difference between the flu and a bad cold at first. But colds almost always go away without causing any real trouble, while the flu can lead to serious complications, such as pneumonia. Recognizing the flu early on can help you treat it appropriately and possibly ward off complications.If your child is at high risk for complications because of an underlying medical condition, quickly spotting a case of the flu can open up possibilities for treatment. If your child is 1 or older, he can receive antiviral drugs, which kill the virus that causes the flu and speed recovery by a day or two. But antiviral drugs only work if taken in the first two days of the illness. Once the 48-hour window closes, they're no longer effective.Here's help distinguishing a cold from a case of the flu:Colds usually come on slowly. The first sign is often a sore, scratchy throat, followed by sneezing and a runny nose with clear mucus that may thicken and turn gray, yellow, or green in the following week or so. Other common symptoms include a cough, a mild headache, watery eyes, mild fatigue, and a stuffy nose.By contrast, flu usually hits like a truck. The symptoms come on quickly and tend to be severe. Your child feels very weak, tired, and achy. He may have a dry cough, a runny nose, chills, a sore throat, swollen glands, a bad headache, and eye pain. His appetite may be poor. In babies and children, the flu can also bring on abdominal pain, diarrhea, and vomiting. (The symptoms of the swine flu are the same as those of the seasonal flu.)If your child acts better (or somewhat better) after his fever comes down, he probably has a cold. If he acts ill even when his temperature drops, it's more likely he has the flu.If you're having trouble identifying your child's illness or are concerned about his symptoms, call your child's doctor. Sometimes it takes a lab test to tell a cold from the flu.Read more about how to tell whether yourbaby,toddler,preschooler, or older childhas a cold or something more serious.Myth 4: It's a good idea to take your children to the doctor when they have a cold.Every year, 1 billion colds strike in the United States. So it's no surprise that the common cold is the number one reason people head to the doctor's office. But almost all those visits are unnecessary because a doctor can't do anything to reduce the length or severity of a cold.If it's really a cold and not something more serious (see Myth 3 for how to tell the difference), keep your child at home. She probably just needs time to get over the virus. You'll save time, money, and exposure to even more germs.A few kids with a cold do need medical help, though. Likewise, some kids with the flu develop complications that require immediate attention. And if your child is younger than 3 months, call the doctor at thefirst sign of any illness.Myth 5: Getting the flu vaccine is more important for adults than for kids.Actually, being immunized against the flu is just as important for children as it is for adults.The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends a yearlyflu shot(starting at age 6 months) for almost everyone, young and old preferably in October or November to allow time for immunity to develop before flu season gets into full swing.Children under 5 are especially vulnerable to the flu because they're at high risk for serious flu-related complications like pneumonia. Every year in the United States, more than 20,000 children under age 5 are hospitalized with the flu. The CDC also stresses the importance of the vaccine for household contacts and caregivers of children under age 5.Tell us:Will your child get the flu vaccine this year?Will you get the flu or swine flu vaccine this year?Myth 6: You can catch the flu from a flu shot.The flu and swine flu shots are made from inactivated (killed) viruses. And it's impossible to catch an illness from a dead virus.You may wonder about that, though, if your child has any of the possible side effects of the shot: a low-grade fever, aches, soreness, swelling, or redness where the shot was given. These symptoms may be uncomfortable, but they're a reaction to the shot, not signs of infection.Find out more about getting theflu shot for your child.Myth 7: Dietary supplements such as zinc, vitamin C, and echinacea can ease children's cold symptoms.Maybe, maybe not. Lots of people swear that taking vitamin C at the first sign of a cold, sucking on a zinc lozenge when a sore throat strikes, or boosting their immunity with echinacea works every time.There's some research to support each of these remedies. Trouble is, there's also research to dispute their effectiveness.You'll find popular OTC remedies that rely on these supplements. Airborne, an OTC herbal remedy that claims to boost immunity, for example, contains echinacea, vitamin C, and zinc. And Gesundheit, a skin patch remedy, contains vitamins C and A, echinacea, and other herbs. But the fact that they're popular doesn't mean that they work or that they're safe.Before giving your child any type of dietary supplement, in any form, talk with her doctor. Even ""natural"" remedies can be harmful for example, the Chinese herb ma huang, also known as ephedra or ephedrine. In adults this herbal decongestant has been linked to high blood pressure, irregular heartbeat, seizures, heart attack, and strokes.ZincStudies on zinc have produced mixed results. Some have found that zinc is merely a placebo. Others report that it reduces the length of colds.Zinc can have side effects, too. Lawsuits against the manufacturer of zinc in nasal spray form, for example, alleged that the product caused permanent damage to the sense of smell. And high doses, which could result from long-term use or inadvertent overdosing, can be toxic.Vitamin CVitamin C has long been touted for its ability to fight off colds. But in 2007, when researchers reviewed 30 long-term studies involving more than 11,000 adults over several decades, they found that daily doses of at least 200 milligrams of vitamin C do little to reduce the symptoms or duration of a cold in most people.Side effects usually aren't a problem with vitamin C, although very large amounts can cause diarrhea and stomach upset. The vitamin is water soluble, so it's not stored in the body and doesn't build up to toxic levels.EchinaceaThe herb echinacea receives mixed reviews, too. Some studies show no benefit, while others report a reduction in the severity and duration of a cold when it's taken at the beginning of an illness.In one study, 524 cold-infected kids ages 2 to 11 showed no improvement when given echinacea versus a placebo. Another study found that children who took it when they had a cold were less likely to have colds in the months that followed. A third study concluded that the herb did little to prevent or shorten a cold.Finally, a review published in 2007 of more than 700 studies concluded that echinacea reduced the risk of catching a cold by 58 percent and made colds go away faster when taken soon after symptoms appeared.Myth 8: Kids in daycare catch more colds than other children.There's truth behind the stereotype of the runny-nosed daycare kid. In the first year of daycare, kids really are more likely to catch colds than kids who are kept at home.But according to a study of more than 135,000 children in Denmark from 1989 to 2004, the risk of infection goes down as a child continues to attend daycare. And after one year in daycare, a child is at no greater risk of illness than a child who stays at home.That early exposure to germs may reap benefits in the long run, too. A 2002 study published in theArchives of Adolescent and Pediatric Medicinefound that kids who attended large daycares as preschoolers suffered fewer colds in later years (up to age 13), presumably because they had built up immunity to most common cold viruses.Myth 9: Breathing the same air as a sick person is the surest way to catch a cold.It's true that cold viruses travel through the air, especially when a sick person coughs or sneezes. But that's only one of the ways that a virus finds its next victim.Viruses can also hitch a ride on your hands. If you touch something that has a virus on it such as a telephone, a toy, or a friend's hand the germs that stick to your hand can easily enter your body if you rub your eyes or nose, their favorite entryways. Common cold viruses can live for three hours on skin or other surfaces.Myth 10: Being cold or wet can make you catch a cold.Only a cold virus can give you a cold. So being cold, in itself, can't make you sick. But being cold and wetcancause a dormant virus (one that's already in your system) to flare up, triggering symptoms.In a 2005 study at Cardiff University's Common Cold Center in Wales, 90 volunteers immersed their feet in ice water for 20 minutes. Over the next five days, the chilled group had twice as many colds as a control group of 90 volunteers whose feet had not been not chilled.The researchers suggest that being chilled causes the blood vessels in the nose to constrict, shutting off the warm blood that supplies infection-fighting white blood cells. Many people are carrying around cold germs, they explain, but getting chilled can make it harder to fight off the effects.So go ahead and tell your child to bundle up and stay dry. Just leave out the ""or you'll catch your death"" part.Myth 11: If you catch a cold, it means your immune system is weak.Perfectly healthy people succumb to cold viruses all the time. In one study, about 95 percent of volunteers became infected with the cold virus when the virus was dropped in their nose. Not everyone infected with a virus actually comes down with a cold, though. About 75 percent of the volunteers who were infected showed symptoms.Some studies do suggest that lower immunity (from chronic illness or stress, for example) can make cold symptoms worse. But a healthy child can easily become infected with one of at least 200 different viruses that cause the common cold.Myth 12: Drinking milk causes the body to produce more mucus.People hotly debate this point, but researchers say there's no need to hide the milk from your child when he has a cold. Several studies have tracked the milk consumption of adults infected with a cold virus. They found no link between dairy consumption and mucus production or any other cold symptoms, for that matter.In one study, researchers found that among the people studied who had a cough, those who drank more milk had a ""looser"" cough.Myth 13: You should feed a cold and starve a fever.There may an inkling of truth to this one, according to Dutch scientists who tested the theory in 2002.Feeding some ill volunteers and giving others only water, the researchers discovered that eating boosts the immune response that attacks cold viruses, while fasting stimulates the response that attacks bacterial infections, which are responsible for many fevers. One problem with their conclusion is that the flu is also likely to cause a fever but, like colds, it's caused by a virus.Many experts still say the old adage is a myth. In any case, the best advice is to follow your child's cues. A sick child needs nourishment for strength and help fighting the infection. But don't force a child who's not hungry to eat. Do make sure your sick child gets plenty of fluids, though, to prevent dehydration.Find out more about getting the flushotfor your child."
Car seat safety: Using a car seat on a plane,https://www.babycenter.com/0_car-seat-safety-using-a-car-seat-on-a-plane_3656331.bc,"Do I have to use a car seat on a plane?You're not required to, but both the Federal Aviation Administration and the American Academy of Pediatrics strongly recommend that you use an FAA-approved child restraint device. That means either an approved car seat or the CARES harness (see below).Legally you may carry a child up to 24 months old on your lap, usually free of charge  but unexpected turbulence can send that lap-carried kid flying out of your arms. And in a crash, your child could be crushed against your body.Ironically, the law mandates that everything in an airplane cabin be battened down during takeoff, landing, and turbulence  except children young enough to ride on their parents' lap.Why isn't there a law requiring child safety restraints in airplanes? Because Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) analyses have found that if forced to buy an extra airline ticket, many families would drive instead. And statistically that's a far more dangerous way to travel.Whether you use a car seat or a harness, your child will need his own seat on the airplane. If your child is young enough to ride free, you may be able to find an empty seat for him, but there's no guarantee. Many airlines offer half-price tickets for small children. Call your airline to ask for a discount, or ask what the company's policy is for using empty seats.What kind of car seat do I need?Before you bring a car seat on board an airplane, make sure it's FAA-approved. The label should read, ""This restraint is certified for use in motor vehicles and aircraft."" Flight attendants are instructed to look for the label, and you may run into problems if it's missing.Be sure to measure the car seat you're planning to travel with, too. To fit into a typical coach seat, the car seat should be no wider than 16 inches (though you can lift the airplane seat's armrest to accommodate slightly wider car seats).How do I position and use the seat?You'll want to book a window seat. That's where you'll need to put the car seat, to make sure it won't block the escape path in an emergency. You may not put a car seat in an aisle seat or exit row.Here's what the FAA recommends for children riding on airplanes:Less than 20 pounds? Ride in a rear-facing car seat.20 to 40 pounds? Ride in a forward-facing car seat.Over 40 pounds? Use the airplane seat belt.As always, follow the manufacturer's instructions carefully when strapping your child into the seat. Is there a harness or belly belt I can use instead?Yes  but only one and it's not for babies under age 1. The only harness-type device approved by the FAA for takeoff, flight, and landing is the Child Aviation Restraint System, or CARES, suitable for children at least 1 year old who weigh between 22 and 44 pounds.CARES weighs 1 pound, fits into a 6-inch stuff sack, and can be attached to any airplane seat. It's sold online and in some retail stores.Supplemental lap restraints, also called belly belts, are not approved for use in airplanes (or any vehicle) in the United States.What about booster seats?Backless booster seats used in cars are not allowed during taxi, takeoff, or landing because kids in these kinds of boosters can be crushed if their airline seat suddenly flops forward under pressure. But boosters with backs and harnesses that are labeled for use in cars and airplanes are allowed. Still, for convenience, you may want to check your child's booster seat as baggage since the FAA says that children big enough for a booster can be properly restrained with the aircraft's seat belt.Where to find more informationFor more information, visit the websites of the FAA and of the nonprofit group Child Passenger Safety.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012a.

How you'll feed your premature baby in the NICU,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-youll-feed-your-premature-baby-in-the-nicu_10300014.bc,"Before your baby was born, you probably dreamed aboutwhat it would be like to hold and feed him. Perhaps you had already decided to feed your baby breast milk or formula.But now that your baby is in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), you may need to adjust your plans. Because feeding is so central to nurturing your baby, these decisions are likely to be loaded with emotion for you.Use whatever combination of breast milk and formula, bottle feeding and nursing works best for you and your baby.BreastfeedingBreast milk providesmany wonderful and vital health benefitsfor all newborns, especially premature or sickbabies. But many NICU babies aren't ready to feed from the breast at first.Moms can learn topump breast milkso it can be delivered to your baby's stomach through a tube. If your baby can't suckle, tube feeding is the best way for him to get your breast milk.You may feel sad and disappointed to substitute an electric pump for a warm, hungry baby. This may not be what you planned. And yet providing breast milk for your baby may help soothe your sorrow over his hospitalization.Breast milk is something truly special and beneficial that you can give your baby. And when your baby is ready to suckle, you can start putting him to your breast. Here are some ideas for meeting the challenges of breastfeeding your baby in the NICU:Discuss your desire to breastfeed with your baby's medical team.Ask for referrals to the NICU's lactation consultant and to other NICU mothers who are successfully pumping milk or breastfeeding their babies.Start pumping as soon as you can.Usethe pump that best works for you. Try a hospital-quality electric pump in good working order.Establish a relaxing ritualso that you condition your breasts to ""let down"" (release milk) when it's time to pump or feed.If you're establishing your milk supply or want to build it up,pump every 2 to 2 1/2 hours around the clock for a couple of days and nights (or eight to 12 times during the day if sleeping at night is paramount). After your milk supply is established, go no more than about eight hours at night, and then pump at least eight times throughout the day.When you pump, be sure to empty your breaststo extract the hind milk, which is highest inthe fat calories your baby needs. Pump for a minute or two after the milk flow stops or comes out in slow drips.Persist through the ups and downsof your milk supply. Expect very small amounts at first. At any time, if your breasts seem unproductive in spite of pumping, you may be tempted to give up. But try to keep going so your breasts stay primed. Try getting more rest, drinking more water, and pumping more frequently (rather than for longer sessions). Your milk supply may build up naturally as you reduce the stress in your body.If your baby is able to suckle, he'll be more receptive to feeding when he's alert and quiet.Ask to feed him in a quiet, darkened room so he doesn't become distracted. Start by doingkangaroo care, or holding your diapered baby against your bare chest. Kangaroo care will relax both of you, and the skin-to-skin contact may inspire him to suck and start your milk flowing. When he starts rooting around on your skin, guide him to your nipple.Recognize that every mother has to figure out what works best.For instance, if your baby has trouble latching on to your nipple, try using your pump's suction to draw out your nipple before putting your baby to the breast. Or if your milk spurts out at the beginning of the feeding and overwhelms your baby, pump just enough beforehand to reduce the pressure or volume. That way, your baby can keep up without swallowing air or choking. Try to find solutions that work for both of you.View the entire feeding relationship as meaningful for you and your baby.If you choose to supply a small amount of milk, or if you want to put your baby to the breast even if you supplement with a bottle afterward, do so. Give yourself room to experiment and adjust.See BabyCenter's information onbreastfeeding your premature babyandpumping your breast milk.Formula feedingBabies thrive with formula feeding, too. There are a number of formula options, and the NICU team will recommend one for your baby. See BabyCenter's information onformula feeding.If you wanted to breastfeed but then decided not to or are forced to give it up,you may feel disappointed. Remember that you can have a close and rewarding relationship with your bottle-fed baby, too.You can experience the closeness of breastfeeding by cuddling your baby against your warm skin and letting your baby observe your face. You can also continue to dokangaroo carefor many months.You may need to wait a while before you feed your baby from a bottle. If he is very premature or ill, he may first need to get formula from a thin tube that's inserted into his stomach through his nose or mouth (gavage feeding). Your baby's nurse can show you how to feed your baby this way, so you can take on the important role of providing nourishment.

How to encourage your budding scientist (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-encourage-your-budding-scientist-ages-5-to-8_10315540.bc,"If you have a mad scientist on your hands, you probably know it. These are the kids who dismantle your alarm clock or develop secret potions that explode or change color. They build complex contraptions out of wood, wheels, and whatever else is lying around, or they collect and collate rocks, shells, and coins.Whether your grade-schooler seems like a born scientist or you'd simply like to nudge her to explore her world, here are some ideas for encouraging young da Vincis.Use what you have on handYou don't have to spend a penny to bring science to life. Kids can experiment with baking soda, vinegar, food coloring, and plastic containers. Water, ice, steam, soil, bubbles, magnets, shadow, air, wind, and light provide hours of discovery. Stumped for ideas? Sites with suggestions include Science with Me, Zoom Sci, Dragon TV Science Fair, Nasa Kids' Club, National Geographic Kids, Cool Science for Curious Kids, and Smithsonian Kids.Point out the science in everyday lifeCooking is a great way for kids to see science at work. Things burn, boil, change color and texture, rise and fall, separate and mix. Take a walk and examine the plants, trees, leaves, footprints, and creatures along the way. Investigate the science behind art, like what happens when you mix colors.Take outings with a science twistVisit science museums, natural history centers, zoos, and discovery play spaces, especially ones that have hands-on activities for kids. These field trips let your child try projects you don't have the equipment, expertise, or space to handle at home. Plus, someone else gets to clean up the mess.Look for after-school classes or summer campsIf your child shows a keen interest in science, a mixed-age class or camp can supplement what's happening in her classroom. Popular topics for school-age children include food chemistry, environmental ecology, and electric gadgetry. These are often less deskbound and more hands-on and elaborate than classroom work.And the mixing of ages can spark discovery: Your 6-year-old may collect water samples with an 8-year-old fellow science nut who can teach her things her peers haven't yet discovered.Veer into the nonfiction section of the libraryYour curious child may like books on space, geology, or marine life. Look, too, for guides to doing science experiments at home. The Magic School Bus series is a big hit with many kids curious about how and why things work.Let magazines and TV fuel her interestMagazines like National Geographic Kids, Ranger Rick, and Your Big Back Yard teach school-age children about animals, water, stars, and more  all in a way they can relate to. And nature documentaries and science-related TV like Zoom on PBS and Grossology on Discovery Channel bring these things to life in a way that books and magazines just can't do.Pick up a kid-style science kitLook in toy stores or museum shops for a butterfly net or bug catcher for your naturalist, test tubes for your chemist, blocks and other construction toys for your engineer. You can also find these online at sites like Steve Spangler Science. Hardware stores sell plastic containers with multiple drawers your compulsive collector can use to categorize shells, rocks, or crystals.Embrace experimentationOften school-age kids don't need any prodding to turn their home into a laboratory  just the time, space, materials, and supervision to safely do their thing.What you can do is rein in the urge to nag about making a mess  science is a messy venture. Lots of projects can be done outdoors. When inside, cover any surfaces you're worried about  then make cleanup part of the project.Follow your child's leadYour job is to expose your child to lots of science-related subjects and let her pick and choose. Maybe your 5-year-old is consumed with reptiles but has no interest in other animals. That's fine. Introduce other topics but respect your child's right to focus on one interest.Expand your child's horizons through her pet projectSay your 8-year-old is passionate about chimpanzees. Find creative ways to incorporate her obsession into music, art, drama, and movement. This may make it easier to interest her in a range of activities.She can read fiction and nonfiction books about chimps, including stories about researchers like Jane Goodall. She can draw pictures and write stories about primates, visit zoos to see the real deal up close, and dress up as a scientist or zookeeper for Halloween.Resist the urge to set the agendaKids with a knack for science often don't respond well to direction, preferring to do their own thing. That's how she learns. Your job is to provide the props and materials and then let your child get busy.A good rule of thumb: Offer assistance if asked. Otherwise, it's best to stay out of it.Avoid both lavish praise and correcting mistakesAt this age, it's better to focus on the process and discovery rather than the result. Some of the best science breakthroughs come when things don't quite go according to plan. So encourage your grade-schooler to try new things and assure her it's fine to get things ""wrong.""Make observations about what you see or ask your child what she's doing and what happened. Try ""Why do you think the volcano made a bigger eruption last time?"" instead of ""I don't think you used enough vinegar.""Watch your little scientist carefullyDon't let your child mix substances (even seemingly harmless ones) until you've verified there won't be an adverse reaction. A quick peek in a science textbook or a Google search should do the trick in most situations.Kids who are interested in experimenting need specific rules for safety. Remind kids never to put substances in their mouths, noses, or eyes."
Is skipping kindergarten right for your child?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_is-skipping-kindergarten-right-for-your-child_10315942.bc,"A generation ago, skipping a grade was considered the best option for a gifted child. Since then, though, the idea has fallen out of vogue. In fact, it's become much more common to hold a preschooler back a year (often called ""red-shirting"") before starting kindergarten to make sure he's ready or to give him an edge.Still, no one wants their kid to be bored, restless, or unchallenged when he starts school. If your preschooler is already reading and writing, understanding math concepts, and discussing advanced ideas in ways his fellow preschoolers aren't, you may be wondering if he'd be better off jumping right into first grade. Here's what the experts advise:How to decide if skipping kindergarten is right for your childFor starters, take a look at the Iowa Acceleration Scale Manual, a tool that considers the kinds of factors schools weigh: intellect, achievement, physical size, peers, motor skills, and social and emotional development.Also, notice who your child likes to be with. ""If your son relates better to adults or older children than kids his own age, that's a sign that skipping a grade would help him feel like he's more among his peers,"" says Linda Powers Leviton, a psychotherapist specializing in the needs of the gifted.If it seems as if skipping might be an option for your child, you could consider an assessment by a professional education therapist (ask your pediatrician for a recommendation). This would factor in what you and your child's teachers have observed, what the therapist observes, plus what you can find out about how the specific school and teacher you're thinking of handle advanced kids.An assessment can help you make an informed decision, and if you do decide to go forward with skipping, might influence the school's decision when you make your request.Ultimately, you should consider skipping only if your child is academically ahead of his peers and has the emotional and social maturity to handle the jump.""Gifted children tend to be sensitive,"" says Leviton, ""so factors like shyness, perfectionism, competitiveness, and self-control should also figure into the equation."" If your child is particularly sensitive to making errors, is easily embarrassed, is very small for his age, or gravitates toward playing with younger kids, skipping a grade could be a devastating experience that leads to poor self-esteem.Some alternatives to skipping a gradeSkipping ahead is usually not the only, or even the first, option explored for a gifted preschooler, because it can be socially disruptive. A child may miss friends he's made who are his own age, and other kids (or even a teacher) may resent a kid who's held up as a ""smarty-pants.""Sometimes a stepping-stone skill gets missed, making it tricky even for a gifted child to keep up. ""Plus,"" says Leviton, ""long-term, a child who skips a grade will be in school with kids who will hit life markers earlier  getting a driver's license, dating  and there may be peer pressure to do things he's not yet ready to do.""Talk to the principal at your child's elementary school to see if there are creative ways to accommodate gifted kids that don't involve a whole grade leap, suggests Jim Delisle, author of Parenting Gifted Kids. ""This can be especially useful if your child's development is uneven  if he's advanced in reading and writing, say, but not in math.""Single-subject skipping  sending a child up to first grade just during reading time  can be a good option at this age. (This, of course, works best at schools where all grades are studying the same subjects at the same time.)Some teachers may be able to accommodate an advanced child in their classroom, letting him pursue more advanced material in his strong areas or allowing him to move through lessons more quickly than his peers.Some schools have a weekly ""pull-out"" program, where a specially trained teacher for gifted children exposes them to moreadvanced concepts, creates special activities, gives them access to experts, or takes them on specially funded field trips.And you can also supplement classroom instruction with summer camps or after-school classes in the subjects where your child shines. If you think skipping is right for your child, what next?The next step will be convincing the school to approve a grade skip. Some, but not all, schools allow grade skipping. Depending on how stretched resources are at the school, it can be a battle. Some have a philosophical reluctance to singling a child out. Some require evidence of giftedness.Before you discuss the idea with the principal, you may want to gather evidence of your child's achievements. That could be a simple journal where you document what your child can do and collect samples of his work or an assessment by a professional education therapist. Or you may consider a giftedness test, though tests are not considered terribly reliable at this age.Many schools have strict birthday cutoff dates for kindergarten regardless of ability, so you'll need to find out what your district's policy is. There is a little-known loophole to the birthday cutoff, though: If you send your child to a kindergarten that will take him at an earlier age (say, a private kindergarten), typically he'll automatically advance to first grade in pretty much any school the next year regardless of his age. The age cutoff usually only applies to kindergartners.Join in the conversation with other BabyCenter parents who are considering skipping."

Essential fatty acids in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_essential-fatty-acids-in-your-childs-diet_10324690.bc,"Essential fatty acids are crucial for children's good health and development. Read on to find out which essential fatty acids your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Why essential fatty acids are importantEssential fatty acids, or EFAs, are types of fat that are essential in the diet because they can't be produced by the body. These fats help build cells, regulate the nervous system, strengthen the cardiovascular system, build immunity, and help the body absorb nutrients. EFAs are also vital for healthy brain function and vision.Essential fatty acids include omega-6 (linoleic acid) and omega-3 (linolenic acid). Both are polyunsaturated fats that help lower cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and keep the heart healthy.Most Americans consume a lot more omega-6 fats than omega-3 fats. Some experts maintain that an imbalance of omega-6 fats to omega-3 fats can impair immune and inflammatory responses in the body and may contribute to such illnesses as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.Other experts and organizations, including the American Heart Association, say striving for balance isn't important. Instead, they simply recommend boosting the amount of omega-3 in your diet.Types of omega-3There are three main types of omega 3 fatty acids: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).Plant-based ALA is a fatty acid found in flaxseeds, walnuts, kale, and soybean oil. When consumed, the body partially converts ALA into DHA and EPA. (It's also found in some types of animal fat.)Marine-based DHA and EPA can be found in fatty fish, including salmon, mackerel, sardines, rainbow trout, and herring.Omega-3s contribute to health in different ways. For example, DHA is critical to brain and eye development. This is why infant formula is fortified with DHA and why pregnant and breastfeeding women are encouraged to get DHA in their diet, either from a food source or a supplement.Experts say both vegetable and fish omega-3s are good for your health, but no one knows for sure if ALA has all the health benefits associated with DHA and EPA. Since plant-based omega-3 only partially converts to DHA and EPA, consuming fatty fish like salmon is important.To make the most of all the health benefits of omega-3s, experts say to get both plant- and marine-based omega-3s.Omega-6 and omega-3: How much does my child need?Ages 1 to 3 years:7,000 milligrams (mg), or 7 grams, of omega-6 daily700 mg, or 0.7 grams, of omega-3 dailyAges 4 to 8 years:10,000 mg, or 10 grams, of omega-6 daily900 mg, or 0.9 grams, of omega-3 dailyOmega-6 fats are usually plentiful in the diet, and it's likely you only need to focus on making sure your child is getting adequate omega-3s. (Many omega-6 fats come from processed foods that contain oils such as soybean oil.)Your child doesn't have to get enough essential fatty acids every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of essential fatty acidsGood sources of omega-3s include:1 teaspoon flaxseed oil: 2,395 mg (not recommended for cooking but good for dressings)1 tablespoon flax seeds, ground: 1,597 mg1/4 cup English walnuts: 2,293 mg1 tablespoon fortified peanut butter: 4,950 mg1 teaspoon walnut oil: 466 mg1 teaspoon wheat germ oil: 310 mg1 teaspoon soybean oil: 300 mg1 teaspoon canola oil: 411 mg1 fortified egg: 100 mg4 ounces tofu: 300 mg1 ounce salmon: 425 mg1/2 cup soybeans (dried, cooked): 500 mg1/2 cup cooked kale: 100 mgLook for foods that have been fortified with omega-3s, such as peanut butter, milk, yogurt, orange juice, margarine, and eggs. The omega-3 content will vary with the brand, so read the label. You'll find fortified eggs containing 100 to 200 mg or more omega-3 fatty acids, for example.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Most of us get more than enough omega-6 (primarily from vegetable oils). Choosing fats that are rich in omega-3 ensures your child gets enough of that, too. Just a teaspoon of canola oil, for instance, contains about half the omega-3s most children need in a day.(Note: Nuts and seeds are not appropriate for very small children because they pose a choking hazard. For the same reason, nut butters should be spread thinly.)Your child will most likely get all the omega-6 fats he needs from processed foods that contain safflower, sunflower, corn, and soybean oils:1 teaspoon safflower oil: 3,360 mg1 teaspoon sunflower oil: 2,966 mg1 teaspoon corn oil: 2,400 mg1 teaspoon soybean oil: 2,300 mgCan your child get too much essential fatty acids?No, your child can't get too much of either of the essential fatty acids  but he can get too much fat in his overall diet. As a general rule, choose mostly fats rich in omega-3 and avoid trans fats and saturated fats.Trans fats  often identified on labels as ""partially hydrogenated oils""  are found in many fried foods (like french fries), baked goods (like cookies, pastries, pizza dough), and stick margarines and shortenings. They're also found in some dairy products and meats.Trans fats raise LDL (""bad"") cholesterol and lower HDL (""good"") cholesterol. They also increase the risk of developing heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.Saturated fats come mostly from animal sources like meat and dairy  fatty meats, lard, cream, butter, and cheese  and are usually solid at room temperature. They're also found in baked and fried foods and some plant foods, like palm oil, palm kernel oil, and coconut oil.To learn more see ten other important nutrients for children and how to avoid mercury in fish.Show sources Hide sources Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. 2011.

Vitamin C in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-c-in-your-childs-diet_10324695.bc,"Vitamin C is crucial for children's good health and development. Read on to find out how much vitamin C your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Why vitamin C is importantVitamin C helps form and repair red blood cells, bones, and tissues. It helps your child's gums stay healthy and strengthens your child's blood vessels, minimizing bruising from falls and scrapes. In addition, vitamin C helps cuts and wounds heal, boosts the immune system, and keeps infections at bay. And it helps the body absorb iron from food sources.How much vitamin C does my child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 15 milligrams (mg) dailyAges 4 to 8: 25 mg dailyThis vitamin is available in so many foods that deficiencies are extremely rare. Children who are very picky eaters and don't eat a lot of fruits and vegetables may not get enough vitamin C. Also, children exposed to secondhand smoke need more vitamin C to repair cell damage from cigarettes.If you're concerned that your child doesn't get enough vitamin C, ask your child's doctor whether you need to boost your child's intake.Your child doesn't have to get enough vitamin C every day.

Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much vitamin C?Vitamin C is water soluble, so any excess is flushed from the body in your child's urine. However, megadoses can still cause nausea, diarrhea, kidney stones, and gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining).Children ages 1 to 3 should not get more than 400 mg of vitamin C a day. Children ages 4 to 8 should not get more than 650 mg a day.Those are the maximum amounts considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine.

Zinc in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_zinc-in-your-childs-diet_10324698.bc,"Zinc is crucial for good health and development. Read on to find out how much zinc your child needs, the best sources, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Find out more: Nine other important nutrients for childrenWhy zinc is importantMore than 70 enzymes depend on zinc to perform their roles in digestion and metabolism. And children who don't get enough zinc risk having stunted growth. Fortunately, zinc deficiencies are rare in the United States.How much zinc does your child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 3 milligrams (mg) per dayAges 4 to 8 years: 5 mg per dayYour child doesn't have to get the recommended daily amount of zinc every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Good sources of zincZinc can be found in a wide variety of foods. Here are some of the best sources of zinc:1/4 cup baked beans with pork and tomato sauce: 3.3 mg1 ounce cooked beef shank: 3 mg1/2 medium broiled hamburger (1.5 ounces), 95% lean: 2.7 mg1 ounce broiled steak: 2.6 mg1/2 cup ready-to-eat breakfast cereal, fortified with 25% of DV for zinc: 2.5 mg1 ounce dry roasted almonds: 1 mg1/2 cup low-fat fruit yogurt: 0.8 mg1 tablespoon cashew butter, no salt added: 0.8 mg1 packet instant oatmeal: 0.8 mg1/4 cup part-skim ricotta cheese: 0.8 mg1/4 cup canned baked beans: 0.8 mg1/4 roasted chicken leg: 0.6 mg1/4 cup garbanzo beans: 0.6 mg1/4 cup lentils: 0.6 mg1/2 ounce Swiss cheese: 0.5 mg1 tablespoon almond butter: 0.5 mg1/4 cup raw tofu, prepared with calcium sulfate: 0.5 mg(Note: Tofu varies in nutrients, depending on how it's processed. Check the nutrient label.)1/4 cup cooked peas: 0.4 mg1/4 cup lima beans: 0.4 mg1/4 skinless chicken breast: 0.4 mg1/2 ounce mozzarella or cheddar cheese: 0.4 mg1/2 cup milk: 0.4 mg1 teaspoon wheat germ: 0.3 mgThe amount of zinc a food contains will vary somewhat, depending on the brand or the cut of meat, for instance. Note that for very young children, nut butters should be thinly spread and other foods (like beans and meats) should be mashed or cut into small pieces to avoid choking.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts of food shown, depending on their age and appetite. You can estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can your child get too much zinc?It's not likely your child will get too much zinc from diet alone, but excessive amounts (from vitamin supplements, for example) can cause adverse effects, like nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and headaches. Too much zinc over the long run can cause long-term toxic effects, as well.The maximum amount considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine for children 1 to 3 years old is 7 mg. For children 4 to 8 years, it's 12 mg. (This is called the tolerable upper intake level or UL.)"
How can I prepare my child for kindergarten?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-can-i-prepare-my-child-for-kindergarten_67245.bc,"Beginning kindergarten is a huge milestone for you and your child, and you can help prepare him for it in many ways. In kindergarten, children learn more about social and communication skills than academics, so instead of drilling your child in his ABCs and numbers, concentrate more on his ability to cooperate, to talk to and play with others, and to follow directions.Here are the best ways to get your child ready for his first big year of school.Focus on your child's social lifeFor most of your child's school day, he will relate to and work with the other children, learning to collaborate on projects and share toys. Children who are comfortable working in groups do the best. If your child has been in preschool, he's probably already adept in this area. If he hasn't, then consider enrolling him in a group activity such as a gymnastics or music class. You can also sign him up for a part-time camp program the summer before kindergarten begins.Try to encourage him to participate in group activities whenever they occur, such as during birthday parties. If you know he's reluctant to join in games like ""Pin the Tail on the Donkey"" or ""Musical Chairs,"" practice these at home with him. You can also take him to playgrounds, pools, libraries, and other neighborhood places where he can meet other children and learn to play with them.Boost his self-awarenessBesides learning to be aware of others, children who begin kindergarten need to be aware of themselves. Help him memorize basic information about himself such as the correct spelling of his name, his age, address, and phone number. He should also be able to name his various body parts. This way, he won't be caught off guard when children or teachers ask him these questions. If he has difficulty memorizing rote facts, such as his phone number, adapt it to the melody of a song he knows.Expand his mindInformally begin to teach your child about numbers and letters as you go about your daily lives. While unpacking grocery bags, for instance, you can count the items and ask him to count with you. You can ask him to put your cans in size order, or to alphabetize them if he already knows some letter sequences. You can ask him to count how many windows are in the house, or to find all the objects that begin with a specific letter. Knowing colors is also useful, so ask him to identify colors on his clothes, cereal boxes, etc. In these casual ways, your child will pick up all the knowledge he needs to begin kindergarten.Devote some time to teaching concepts as well. Understanding the difference between words like ""same"" and ""different"" or ""more"" and ""less"" will help a child express his thoughts. Another important tool is the art of describing and making distinctions; this is why the characters on Sesame Street play ""One of these things is not like the other..."" You can do the same at home. Put three oranges and a banana in a bowl, and ask him to choose the one that's different. Discuss ""place"" words, or prepositions, such as ""under,"" ""above,"" ""beside,"" and ""through,"" and words that describe time, such as ""before"" and ""after.""See more activities that build reading skills and activities that build math skills.Encourage nimblenessBefore children can learn to write, they have to develop their fine motor skills. To help, give your child small jobs to do around the house that encourage him to use the muscles in his arms and fingers, such as opening mail, sorting silverware, stirring batter, and tying shoes.You can also buy thick markers or pieces of chalk and suggest that your child spend some time drawing  whether on a big pad of paper or on the driveway. Playing with fluid materials like water and sand will help his coordination, too. You can also buy him a set of kid-sized tools and ask him to make small repairs around the house  tightening screws and hammering nails, for instance.Surround him with wordsThere are many pre-kindergarten workbooks available, but most experts advise against using them unless your child specifically asks for them. If he doesn't, then just nurture his love of language whenever and however you can. Read to him frequently during the day, and encourage him to make up his own stories as he looks at pictures. You can also ask your child to tell you a story for you to write down; then you can read it back to him, and he can ""read"" it back to you. Read billboards, TV schedules, magazines, shopping lists  whatever is at hand. Visit libraries and bookstores regularly.Get more tips on raising a child who loves reading.Tour the schoolYou can also make sure that your child is familiar with the school building. Many schools hold an orientation for pre-kindergartners, but feel free to supplement that visit with more informal ones. Take your child to visit the school at different times during the day so he can see children getting on and off the bus, and playing during recess. Let him play in the school playground on the weekends. One morning, you can also walk with him to the bus stop he will use so he can see children waiting for the bus and watch them board. This will help him feel more comfortable with the day-to-day routine of going to school."
"School types: The difference between public, private, magnet, charter, and more",https://www.babycenter.com/0_school-types-the-difference-between-public-private-magnet-ch_67288.bc,"Approximately 49 million students are enrolled in the nation's public schools in kindergarten through grade 12. Another 6 million attend private schools.But if you follow the news, you know that several new types of schools have appeared in recent years, meaning that choosing a school is no longer a simple matter. For example, what's the difference between a magnet school and a charter school? Parochial and proprietary? And which one is best for your child?Here's a brief description of the different types of schools on today's educational landscape.Public schoolsPublic schools get their financing from local, state, and federal government funds. In most cases, they must admit all students who live within the borders of their district. Charter schools and magnet schools are two relatively new kinds of public schools.Charter schools began appearing in the early 1990s. They are independently operated public schools started by parents, teachers, community organizations, and for-profit companies. These schools receive tax dollars, but the sponsoring group may also come up with private funding. Charter schools do not charge tuition.These schools must adhere to the basic curricular requirements of the state but are free from many of the regulations that apply to conventional schools. They are not subject to the scrutiny of school boards or government authorities.Considered cutting edge, charter schools usually challenge standard education practices and sometimes specialize in a particular area, such as technology or the arts, or adopt a basic core-subjects approach. Some charter schools specifically target gifted or high-risk kids. They usually have smaller classes and offer more individual attention than conventional public schools.There are about 3,000 charter schools in the United States. To learn more about charter schools and find them in your area, visit the National Charter School Resource Center.Magnet schools are free public schools that can be highly competitive and highly selective. They're renowned for their special programs and high academic standards. They may specialize in a particular area, such as science or the arts.Students who apply to these schools may go through a rigorous testing and application process. Some magnet schools have boarding facilities to allow students from other communities to attend.Magnet schools were first launched in the 1970s to help desegregate public school systems by encouraging children to attend schools outside their neighborhoods. Student diversity is still an explicit goal of most magnet schools.Public school choice programs free families from having to attend their assigned neighborhood school. Some districts voluntarily offer school choice. Others are required to provide parents with options when a school is failing to meet the standards set by the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001. Private schoolsPrivate schools rely on tuition payments and funds from nonpublic sources such as religious organizations, endowments, grants, and charitable donations.These schools select from a pool of students who apply for admission. They may be coed or single sex. About a third of the elementary and secondary schools in the United States are private.Independent schools are private, nonprofit schools governed by boards of trustees. This category includes such famous private schools as Andover and Exeter.Independent schools draw their funds from tuition payments, charitable contributions, and endowments rather than from taxes or church funds. They may be affiliated with a religious institution but cannot receive funds or governance from them.Of the 34,000 private schools in the United States, only about 2,000 are independent. Nearly three-fourths of those are members of the National Association of Independent Schools, which means they have been accredited by a recognized state or regional body and have agreed to practice nondiscriminatory policies.Many accept boarding students as well as day students. The median tuition for day schools is $17,880, meaning half are less expensive and half cost more. For boarding schools, the median tuition is $34,900.Parochial schools are church-related schools, most commonly owned and operated by Catholic parishes or dioceses but also by Protestant denominations. Hebrew schools may also be termed parochial.The majority of private schools in the United States are parochial schools. The academic curriculum at these schools is supplemented with required daily religious instruction and prayer. Teachers may be clergy or laypersons who may or may not be trained educators.Your child doesn't have to be Catholic or Protestant to attend a parochial school, but she will still be required to attend religious education classes and prayer services.Parochial schools cost, on average, $6,733 per year for an elementary school student and $10,549 for a high school student.Proprietary schools are private schools run for profit. This is a relatively new category of school. They do not answer to any board of trustees or elected officials, so they claim to be able to respond quickly to the demands of the market.Many belong to an organization called the National Independent Private Schools Association. Tuition is comparable to that of private, nonprofit schools.Home schoolsA growing number of children  about 1.5 million in 2007  are educated at home by parents or private tutors, or through online programs. A few of these homeschooled students attend school part time, but most do not. Some homeschooling families join cooperatives to share resources and learn in a group setting.Most parents who choose homeschooling want to give their children religious or moral instruction, according to recent National Household Education Surveys. Many other families are worried about the public school environment or are unhappy with the quality of instruction in public schools.Families can create their own curriculum or buy educational materials developed for homeschoolers. States regulate home schools and set requirements.State oversight varies widely. Some states don't even require notification that a child is being educated at home, while others require homeschooled students to take tests or have their progress evaluated in some way. In a few states, homeschooling parents must use curricula approved by the state, obtain teaching credentials, or undergo home visits by state officials.For more information on homeschooling, visit the Home School Legal Defense Association."
Bowlegs (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_bowlegs-ages-5-to-8_68538.bc,"Could my child be bowlegged?It's absolutely normal for a baby's legs to appear bowed, so that if he were to stand up with his toes forward and his ankles touching, his knees wouldn't touch. Babies are born bowlegged because of their position in the womb.You may notice bowleggedness more as your child starts to stand and walk, but typically the legs gradually straighten out. By age 3, most kids no longer appear bowlegged. And by age 7 or 8, most children's legs have reached the angle they'll retain into adulthood.Rarely, bowlegs are caused by a vitamin D deficiency (also called rickets) or a condition called Blount's disease, a bone disorder that affects the shins. Even more uncommonly, bowlegs are caused by rare genetic disorders.How can I tell if my child is bowlegged?If your child stands with his toes forward and his ankles together and his knees don't touch, he's bowlegged. If his knees touch but his ankles don't, he's knock-kneed. (Being knock-kneed is generally most obvious between ages 3 and 6. Like bowleggedness, it usually corrects itself.)Should I mention it to the doctor?If your child is a baby or young toddler, the appearance of bowleggedness is probably normal. But if you're concerned, have the doctor check it out.If your child is just 2 years old or so, he may still appear a little bowlegged, but there should be some improvement from toddlerhood. If he's had his third birthday and his bowleggedness is still apparent, it's worth having the doctor take a look.At any age, it's worth mentioning to the doctor if you think it's extreme, affecting only one side, or getting worse instead of better.The doctor will probably examine your child and note his history. A blood test may be done to rule out a vitamin D deficiency and X-rays may be taken to rule out Blount's disease.If there is a vitamin deficiency, the doctor will prescribe a supplement. Your child may also be referred to a pediatric orthopedist for further evaluation or treatment.Can bowlegs be corrected?Treatment is rarely needed, but very occasionally surgery is used to correct a severe curve. Most experts today don't recommend braces or corrective shoes because they can cause problems with physical development.Show sources Hide sources Boston Children's Hospital. Undated.

Doctor visit: The four-year checkup,https://www.babycenter.com/doctor-visit-worksheet-four-year-checkup,"You can expect your child's doctor to:Weigh and measure your child to make sure he's growing at a healthy, steady rate.Check his blood pressure.Check his heart and breathing.Check his immunization record and give him any shots that are new or that he's missed, along with shots he needs to start school, including the DTaP, polio, MMR, and chicken pox, and hepatitis A vaccines.Do a tuberculosis test if your child has any risk factors.Do a hearing screening. Your child will put on headphones, and the doctor will ask him to respond (perhaps by raising his hand) whenever he hears a noise. The doctor will play sounds at different frequencies, from really high to really low. If your child doesn't respond well, he may be referred to an audiologist for more thorough testing to see if he has a hearing problem.Do an eye exam to check the structure and alignment of your child's eyes and his ability to move them correctly. The doctor will also look for signs of congenital eye conditions or other problems, and check his eyesight with an eye chart.Answer any questions you have about your child's growth or development.Talk to you about safety precautions you should take, such as having your child wear a bike helmet while riding, making sure there is a fence around your pool if you have one, and keeping guns, if you own any, in a locked cabinet separate from the ammunition.Talk to your child about things he enjoys or ask him to sing a song, to assess his language development.Possibly ask your child to draw a picture of a person in order to see how his mind is developing.Questions the doctor may ask:Has she been sick or made any trips to the ER?How's the toilet training going? At 4, most children are potty trained or almost there, although bed-wetting is still pretty common.What does she like to eat? It is important that your 4-year-old have a healthy diet.Can she ride a tricycle? By age 4, most children have developed the coordination to ride a tricycle. Some may be ready to move up to a two-wheeler with training wheels.Has she started preschool? How does she like it?Is there fluoride in the water where you live? If there isn't, your child may need to start taking a fluoride supplement to help her teeth and bones grow strong.What games does she like? Four-year-olds have active imaginations, and most have started playing pretend or make-believe games.Have you had a personal safety talk? The doctor may ask your child what her parents' names are and if she knows which body parts are private. He may ask if you've had any talks about stranger safety and what to do if she gets lost.What's next?Find out what's in store for you at the 5-year doctor visit."
Postpartum hemorrhage,https://www.babycenter.com/0_postpartum-hemorrhage_1152328.bc,"Is it normal to bleed a lot after delivery?All women lose some blood as the placenta separates from the uterus and immediately afterward. And women who have c-sections generally lose more than those who give birth vaginally. But because the amount of blood in your body increases by almost 50 percent during your pregnancy, your body is well prepared to deal with this expected blood loss.Normal bleeding just after childbirth is primarily from open blood vessels in the uterus, where the placenta was attached. (If you had an episiotomy or tear during birth, you may also bleed from that site until it's stitched up.)As the placenta begins to separate, these vessels bleed into the uterus. After the placenta is delivered, the uterus usually continues to contract, closing off these blood vessels.Your healthcare practitioner may massage your uterus and give you a synthetic form of the hormone oxytocin (Pitocin) to help the uterus contract. Breastfeeding, which prompts your body to release oxytocin naturally, can also aid in the process.Unfortunately, some women bleed too much after birth  sometimes due to placenta previa or placenta accreta  and require special treatment. This excessive blood loss is called a postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and it happens in up to 6 percent of births.It's most likely to occur while the placenta is separating or soon after. If it happens within 24 hours after giving birth, it's considered an early PPH (also called an immediate or primary PPH). If it happens in the days or weeks after delivery, it's called a late (or delayed or secondary) PPH.What else might cause a PPH?Occasionally, cervical lacerations, deep tears in your vagina or perineum, or even a large episiotomy may be the source of a postpartum hemorrhage. A rupturedor inverted uterus may cause profuse bleeding, but these are relatively rare occurrences.Finally, a systemic blood clotting disorder may cause a hemorrhage. (A clotting disorder may be an inherited condition or it may develop during pregnancy as a result of certain complications, such as severe preeclampsia or HELLP syndrome or a placental abruption.) And a hemorrhage itself can cause clotting problems, leading to even heavier bleeding. What's the treatment for PPH?There are a number of steps that your medical team will take right away if you begin to bleed excessively. Since uterine atony (loss of tone) is the most common cause of PPH, your caregiver will massage your uterus to help it contract while you get intravenous oxytocin. (If you don't already have an IV, the nurse will start one immediately.) You will also be catheterized to make sure your bladder is empty since a full bladder makes it more difficult for your uterus to contract.If your placenta hasn't come out yet, your practitioner will attempt to deliver it, which in some cases requires her to reach up inside your uterus and remove it manually. You'll receive some pain medication before the procedure, and if you're in a birthing room you'll be moved to an operating room.If you start bleeding  or continue to bleed  from your uterus after the placenta is out, you'll receive other medications in addition to oxytocin while your caregiver continues to massage your uterus. In most cases, the medication works very quickly and the uterus contracts, stopping the bleeding.If need be, your practitioner will insert a hand inside your vagina and place her other hand on your belly, and compress your uterus between her two hands. This measure in combination with medication is usually enough to stem the tide.If you continue to bleed, you'll be transferred to the operating room and given pain medication to keep you comfortable. The doctor will carefully check to make sure that there are no lacerations that appear to be the primary source of your bleeding. She will also ""explore"" your uterus (via your vagina) to check for fragments of the placenta that may remain. In some cases, you'll need a procedure called dilation and curettage (D&C) to remove them.If your bleeding is extensive and doesn't stop or your vital signs aren't stable, you'll get a blood transfusion. This is necessary only in rare cases. Even more rarely, you'll need abdominal surgery and possibly a hysterectomy to stop a hemorrhage.Regardless of the cause of the hemorrhage, your blood pressure and pulse will be taken frequently to help your caregiver gauge how your body is coping with the blood loss. (This is done right after birth anyway to help determine the amount of postpartum blood loss.) An abnormally low blood pressure or high pulse will provide your caregiver with valuable information.You'll also have blood tests to check for anemia and, if necessary, to see whether your blood is clotting normally.What's the recovery like?You'll continue to receive IV fluids and medication after the bleeding is controlled to help your uterus stay contracted, and you'll be watched very closely for further bleeding and to see how you're doing in general. You may feel weak and lightheaded. Don't try to get out of bed on your own.Your recovery will depend in part on how much blood you lost and what your ""reserves"" were to begin with  that is, how much your blood volume had increased during pregnancy and whether or not you were anemic to begin with.You'll probably develop anemia from the blood loss and will have to take it easy when you get home from the hospital. You'll need to get plenty of rest, fluids, and nutritious food. Your doctor will likely prescribe prenatal vitamins with folic acid, as well as additional iron supplements.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2006 (reaffirmed 2008).

Uterine inversion,https://www.babycenter.com/0_uterine-inversion_1152334.bc,"What is a uterine inversion?Uterine inversion is a serious but rare complication of childbirth in which the uterus literally turns inside out after the baby is delivered. When this happens, the top of the uterus (the fundus) comes through the cervix or even completely outside the vagina. It occurs in about 1 in 3,000 births.Normally, after a vaginal birth, contractions cause the placenta to separate from the wall of the uterus. This typically happens within five to ten minutes after you give birth, though it may take longer. As long as you're not bleeding, your doctor or midwife can wait a while for the placenta to separate on its own.(If the placenta doesn't separate on its own, your practitioner will do what's known as a manual removal of the placenta, which involves reaching up through your vagina and into the uterus with one hand and ""peeling"" the placenta away from the uterine wall.)After your caregiver sees signs that the placenta is separating, she may ask you to gently push to help expel the placenta out of your uterus and through the vagina. She may help guide the placenta out of the vagina by gently pulling on the umbilical cord.Sometimes, a placenta doesn't separate normally, and attempts to deliver it cause a uterine inversion. It's possible for a uterine inversion to happen on its own, too.A uterine inversion can cause serious problems, including life-threatening bleeding and shock, particularly if it's not recognized and treated immediately.How is it treated?Your doctor or midwife will try to reposition your uterus and push the fundus back through the cervix.If you don't already have an IV, one will be started immediately. You'll be given medication to control the pain and drugs to relax your uterus, which helps your caregiver reposition it. Occasionally, abdominal surgery is necessary to return the uterus to its original position.Once your uterus has been repositioned, the drugs that were used to relax the uterus will be stopped. You'll be given a continuous IV infusion of oxytocin to firm up your uterus, help it stay where it belongs, and control bleeding. Until your uterus firms up, your caregiver will apply pressure to it with one hand inside your vagina and the other on your belly to compress the uterus and slow the bleeding.Your medical team will continue to watch you closely. They'll check your uterus to be sure it remains in position and monitor your vital signs and vaginal bleeding. You'll get blood transfusions as needed and will likely be given antibiotics to prevent infection. You're apt to feel weak and lightheaded, and at first you shouldn't try to get out of bed on your own.Once you're home, you'll need to take good care of yourself. Make sure you get lots of rest, eat nutritious meals, drink plenty of fluids, and follow any other instructions from your caregiver to the letter. (You'll be told to take iron supplements, for example.)What you need to know for future pregnanciesOnce you've had one uterine inversion, you're more likely to have another one. As with any pregnancy complication or other medical problem, be sure your doctor or midwife is aware of your history. This gives your caregiver a chance to prepare for the possibility of another inversion by making sure you have an IV running and an anesthesiologist immediately available, if needed, for your delivery.Show sources Hide sources Gupta P, et al. 2014.

Lactose intolerance,https://www.babycenter.com/0_lactose-intolerance_1201464.bc,"What is lactose intolerance?When you're lactose intolerant, it means your body can't produce enough lactase, the enzyme needed to digest lactose, the primary sugar in cow's milk and other dairy products. As a result, the undigested lactose stays in the intestine and causes gastrointestinal problems. These problems tend to be uncomfortable but not dangerous.Babies who are born prematurely sometimes can't produce adequate amounts of lactase for a while. A baby's level normally increases during the end of the last trimester of pregnancy.True lactose intolerance usually shows up in the grade-school or teen years. While it's possible for symptoms to appear earlier, it's very unlikely that your baby is lactose intolerant.What causes lactose intolerance?We don't know why some people are lactose intolerant and others aren't, but it's not rare. Between 30 and 50 million people in the United States are lactose intolerant.Genetics play a role: About 90 percent of Asian Americans  and as many as 75 percent of African American, Hispanic American, Jewish, and Native American adults  are lactose intolerant. About 15 percent of people of northern European descent have the condition.Very rarely, a baby is born with lactose intolerance. (Both parents would have to pass the gene for this type of lactose intolerance to the baby.) From birth, the baby would have severe diarrhea and be unable to tolerate the lactose in his mother's breast milk or in formula made from cow's milk. He'd need a special, lactose-free infant formula.If your baby has had a severe case of diarrhea, his body may temporarily have trouble producing lactase, and he may have symptoms of lactose intolerance for a week or two.Some medications can also cause the body to produce lower levels of lactase, causing temporary lactose intolerance. People with long-term conditions that affect the intestines (like celiac disease or Crohn's disease) sometimes suffer from lactose intolerance as well.What are the symptoms of lactose intolerance?If your baby is lactose intolerant, he may have diarrhea, abdominal cramping, bloating, or gas about 30 minutes to two hours after drinking breast milk or eating dairy products, like cheese or yogurt, once he starts eating solids. (Babies should not drink cow's milk until their first birthday.)Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.Some lactose-intolerant people can consume a small amount of dairy without symptoms. Others will be uncomfortable every time they have food containing even a small amount of lactose.Is lactose intolerance the same as a milk allergy?No. An allergy is an immune response, while lactose intolerance is a digestive condition. The symptoms can be similar, however. Abdominal pain or diarrhea after consuming milk products could be caused by a milk allergy or by lactose intolerance, for example.If your baby develops a dry, itchy rash or itching and swelling of the face, lips, or mouth whenever he has dairy products  or symptoms such as hives, watery eyes, or a runny nose  he may be allergic to one of the proteins in cow's milk.How will I know for sure if my baby is lactose intolerant?Again, it's very unlikely that your baby is showing signs of lactose intolerance at this age, but talk with his doctor. She'll ask about your baby's symptoms to help determine whether it's a possibility. She may suggest that you eliminate all sources of lactose from your baby's diet for a couple of weeks to see whether his symptoms subside.Can lactose intolerance be treated or prevented?No, but there are things you can do to help your baby if he's lactose intolerant.Read labels. You'll want to avoid dairy products and all other foods that contain lactose. Some seemingly innocuous foods contain milk products: pancake and cookie mixes, breakfast cereals, instant potatoes and soups, margarine, salad dressings, breads, and lunch meats. Check food labels for ingredients such as whey, curds, milk byproducts, dry milk solids, and nonfat dry milk powder.Thanks to recent legislation, products containing milk ingredients (or other common allergens) must be clearly labeled as such. This should make your task much easier.Watch how your baby reacts. Some people who are lactose intolerant can digest small amounts of lactose, while others are very sensitive to the tiniest quantities. You'll probably learn through trial and error how much of which dairy foods your baby can handle.Some cheeses have less lactose than others, for example, so they may be easier to digest. And live-culture yogurt is generally easier to digest than milk and other dairy products because the healthy bacteria in it helps produce lactase.If your baby is very sensitive, you'll want to avoid all sources of lactose. If not, you may be able to give him small amounts of selected dairy foods. He may find it easier to tolerate dairy products if he eats them along with other foods.Make sure all of your baby's nutritional needs are being met. If you find that you need to eliminate dairy products from your baby's diet as he grows, you'll want to be sure that he has other sources of calcium, which helps bones and teeth grow strong. Nondairy sources of calcium include leafy greens, fortified juices and soy milk, tofu, broccoli, canned salmon, oranges, and fortified breads.Other nutrients to be concerned about are vitamins A and D, riboflavin, and phosphorus. See our article on food sources of various nutrients for suggestions on how your child can get the nutrients he needs from nondairy sources. You might also find it helpful to consult a dietitian.Lactose-free dairy products are now available in many grocery stores. They have all the nutrients of regular dairy products without the lactose.And finally, if you find that it's difficult to get your baby all the nutrition he needs without dairy products, talk with his doctor about whether your baby might benefit from taking supplements.Show sources Hide sources AAP.

Sleep aids for toddlers,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sleep-aids-for-toddlers_1290152.bc,"Part of helping your toddler learngood sleep habitsis teaching him to fall asleep on his own. But even the best sleepers sometimes need a little extra assistance  which is where sleep aids come in. These products and techniques range from a teddy bear to a glass of warm milk, but all share the common purpose of helping your toddler get to sleep.Look below to find a sleep aid that's right for you and your toddler. But remember that although the right sleep aid can be a lifesaver in the short term, using it may also have a downside if you want your child to learn to get to sleep by himself.Tried and trueYou can't go wrong with one of these sleep aids  all help your toddler fall asleep without leading to any problems or bad sleep habits.Bedtime ritualThe experts all agree that establishing a calming, consistentbedtime ritualis one of the best ways to help your child make the transition to sleep. Your ritual can include any (or all) of the following: giving her a bath, playing a quiet game, helping your toddler into her pajamas, reading abedtime storyor two, singing alullaby, and giving her a kiss goodnight.Whatever routine works for your family is fine, as long as you do it in the same order and at the same time every night. Setting and sticking to a consistent bedtime  on weekdays and weekends alike  is key toestablishing good sleep habits.Thumb-suckingThumb-sucking is a perfectly acceptable way for your child to comfort herself  at bedtime or any other time  although it may lead to dental problems in older children.Night-lightMany toddlers get disoriented and upset when they wake up at night in a dark room and can't see anything they recognize. Luckily, a simple night-light reassures your child that she's in familiar surroundings and helps her settle back to sleep.Get in the habit of flipping it on as you're getting her ready for bed. Any kind will do, though some fancy models include a music player you can attach to your toddler's bed.Transitional objectYour toddler may fall asleep more easily if she has a soft, cuddly blanket or stuffed animal nearby to keep her company. According to T. Berry Brazelton, pediatrician and author ofTouchpoints, toddlers who learn to comfort themselves withloveys(as he calls them) are demonstrating their inner strength.Maybe, maybe notSome parents swear by the following methods and products, but many experts disagree about their usefulness. PediatricianWilliam Searssuggests experimenting with different methods to help your toddler fall asleep, but other sleep experts  includingRichard FerberandJodi Mindell advise against any practice or gizmo that makes your toddler depend on it to nod off.Read through the following list with this thought in mind: The ultimate goal isn't just a sleeping child, but one who knows how to get to sleep by himself every night.Rocking or breastfeedingRocking or nursing your toddler is a wonderful way to parent him to sleep, says Sears, author ofNighttime Parenting. Ferber and Mindell don't recommend rocking or nursing to sleep, stating that you'll only teach your child to need it to get to sleep. (Also, shifting your growing toddler from your arms to his crib without waking him is often tricky.)Warm milkIf your toddler's no longer nursing, drinking a glass of warm milk before bed might help him fall asleep. The amino acid L-tryptophan (found in milk and other foods) is thought to play a role in making you sleepy by raising the levels of serotonin and melatonin  sleep-inducing chemicals  in the brain.However, the amount of sleep-inducing substances in milk is quite small, so the benefits may be purely psychological. Your toddler might simply be remembering the comfort of being held and fed as an infant.If you do give your toddler milk before bed, don't let your child take a bottle or sippy cup of milk to bed with him because that can lead to cavities  and be sure to help your child brush his teeth after he drinks it.PacifierUsing apacifierhelps many toddlers comfort themselves back to sleep, but some experts believe pacifiers aren't the best sleep aids. Why not? If your toddler learns to depend on one at bedtime and it falls out of his reach, he won't be able to go back to sleep until he finds it. You can try to avoid that problem by strategically placing several pacifiers in his crib or bed.White noise machine or soft musicYou can buy or record household ""music"" (like the sound of vacuuming, running water, or windshield wipers), or you can invest in a white noise machine. Like ambient noise, playing recordings of lullabies, classical music, and other kids' favorites for your toddler at bedtime may help him drift into dreamland. Music and white noise supply calming background sounds to help your child fall asleep.Of course,singing a lullabyto your child before he falls asleep is always a great option because your toddler responds best to your voice. A music box or musical lamp may also work.But consider these methods short-term solutions if you want your toddler to learn to fall asleep on his own rather than depend on special noises.Sleep drugs and supplementsA final word of caution: Consult your child's doctor before giving your child sleeping pills or other drugs that encourage sleep  they may not be safe or effective. Most experts also frown upon giving herbs to toddlers because safe pediatric doses have not been established, and some could be toxic in high doses. Also, a child's body may react differently to medicines and herbs than an adult's body does.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012a. The 4 B's of bedtime.

Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS),https://www.babycenter.com/0_irritable-bowel-syndrome-ibs_1389871.bc,"My child has diarrhea a lot of the time. Could this be irritable bowel syndrome (IBS)?It could be, since IBS (also known as ""spastic colon"") can cause diarrhea, bloating, cramping, and constipation. If these symptoms last more than a few days, they warrant a trip to the doctor since they can also signal a more serious problem such as inflammatory bowel disease. If your child is diagnosed with IBS, though, rest assured that it's not causing him any physical damage, only a lot of discomfort.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.What is IBS?No one knows what triggers IBS. Normally, muscle contractions in the intestines keep our bowels moving properly. But if your child has IBS, his intestines are extra sensitive. Eating, gas, or even stress can bring on muscle spasms in his colon, or large intestine, which may cause painful abdominal cramps, constipation, diarrhea, or some combination of all three. (Kids under 5 often have diarrhea with no pain, whereas kids 5 and older more often have abdominal cramps.) Your child may become nauseated or develop a headache as well. The discomfort typically subsides after a bowel movement. IBS can affect people of all ages, and it can be either a temporary or a chronic condition.How is IBS diagnosed?Your child's doctor will give him a thorough physical exam and may diagnose him based on his symptoms. If she suspects a more serious condition like inflammatory bowel disease, she will probably refer him to a gastroenterologist. To rule out inflammation or ulcers in the GI tract, this doctor may order X-rays or examine your child's colon using an endoscope. This is a camera on the end of a tiny tube that's inserted through his anus. The procedure is not painful, but the doctor may give him a mild sedative.How is IBS treated?There's no cure, but a diet high in fiber and low in fat can help a lot. Fiber will make his stool bulkier, which will stretch out the colon a little and cut down on the spasms. (You can try to get your child to eat more fruits, veggies, and whole grains, or you can try adding a tablespoon or two of a fiber supplement to his oatmeal or orange juice every day.) Fat tends to aggravate the condition, so avoiding it may ease symptoms. The doctor probably won't recommend laxatives for the constipation, since it's easy to wind up relying on them to have bowel movements at all.Sometimes kids with severe IBS lose weight. Eating can bring on the symptoms, so some children dodge meals to avoid them. Keep an eye on your child's eating habits to make sure he gets the nutrients he needs to stay healthy. Stress can trigger symptoms too. Exercise and other methods of keeping tension at bay can improve his condition."
Bowlegs,https://www.babycenter.com/0_bowlegs_1435105.bc,"Could my child be bowlegged?It's absolutely normal for a baby's legs to appear bowed, so that if he were to stand up with his toes forward and his ankles touching, his knees wouldn't touch. Babies are born bowlegged because of their position in the womb. Dr. P. Marazzi / Science SourceYou may notice bowleggedness more as your child starts to stand and walk, but typically the legs gradually straighten out. By age 3, most kids no longer appear bowlegged. And by age 7 or 8, most children's legs have reached the angle they'll retain into adulthood.Rarely, bowlegs are caused by a vitamin D deficiency (also called rickets) or a condition called Blount's disease, a bone disorder that affects the shins. Even more uncommonly, bowlegs are caused by rare genetic disorders.How can I tell if my child is bowlegged?If your child stands with his toes forward and his ankles together and his knees don't touch, he's bowlegged. If his knees touch but his ankles don't, he's knock-kneed. (Being knock-kneed is generally most obvious between ages 3 and 6. Like bowleggedness, it usually corrects itself.)Should I mention it to the doctor?If your child is a baby or young toddler, the appearance of bowleggedness is probably normal. But if you're concerned, have the doctor check it out.If your child is just 2 years old or so, he may still appear a little bowlegged, but there should be some improvement from toddlerhood. If he's had his third birthday and his bowleggedness is still apparent, it's worth having the doctor take a look.At any age, it's worth mentioning to the doctor if you think it's extreme, affecting only one side, or getting worse instead of better.The doctor will probably examine your child and note his history. A blood test may be done to rule out a vitamin D deficiency and X-rays may be taken to rule out Blount's disease.If there is a vitamin deficiency, the doctor will prescribe a supplement. Your child may also be referred to a pediatric orthopedist for further evaluation or treatment.Can bowlegs be corrected?Treatment is rarely needed, but very occasionally surgery is used to correct a severe curve.

Postpartum: Late hemorrhage,https://www.babycenter.com/0_postpartum-late-hemorrhage_1456138.bc,"How can I tell whether my postpartum bleeding is abnormal?All new moms have vaginal bleeding and discharge, known as lochia, as the uterus sheds its thick lining of tissue from the pregnancy. Lochia is normally bright red at first, but it should get progressively lighter in color and amount over the first few days. If bright red bleeding continues after four days, or if at any time you seem to be bleeding more instead of less, it could indicate a problem and should prompt a call to your caregiver.About one percent of postpartum women have what's called a late postpartum hemorrhage (also known as a delayed or secondary postpartum hemorrhage). This term is used to describe severe bleeding that occurs between 24 hours and 12 weeks after childbirth, though late postpartum hemorrhages typically occur one to two weeks postpartum. (Profuse bleeding that occurs within the first 24 hours is classified as a primary postpartum hemorrhage.)Call your caregiver right away if you notice any of these signs:Bleeding that soaks more than one sanitary pad in an hourBright red bleeding that occurs four days or more after deliveryBlood clots bigger than a golf ballNote: Call 911 if you're bleeding profusely or if you have any signs of shock, including lightheadedness, weakness, rapid heartbeat or palpitations, rapid or shallow breathing, clammy skin, restlessness, or confusion.6 things you'll need for postpartum recovery Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:29Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:29Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosWhat causes late postpartum hemorrhage?Late postpartum hemorrhage may be caused by a uterus that doesn't contract normally, possibly as a result of fragments of the placenta or the amniotic sac that remain in the uterus after birth, an infection, or both. A late postpartum hemorrhage may also be caused by an inherited disorder that alters your blood's ability to clot, such as von Willebrand's disease. Sometimes, though, the cause is unknown. What's the treatment for late postpartum hemorrhage?Bleeding can become life-threatening, so you'll be hospitalized until it stops. Your caregiver will examine you and start an IV to give you fluid, medication to help your uterus contract, and possibly antibiotics. An ultrasound will be done to see if any placental tissue remains in your uterus.If there's tissue, your caregiver may need to do a surgical procedure called a dilation and curettage (D&C) to remove it. In extreme cases, if all other attempts to stem the bleeding fail, you will need a hysterectomy.Once the bleeding has stopped, you'll need to continue getting IV medication, usually for another 24 hours, to keep your uterus well contracted. You may continue to get antibiotics, too.Your medical team will watch you closely for further bleeding, signs of infection, and to see how you're recovering. You might feel weak and lightheaded, and at first you shouldn't try to get out of bed on your own.Rest, fluids, a nutritious diet, and prenatal vitamins with folic acid as well as additional iron supplements are essential. In most cases, that's all you'll need to deal with the anemia caused by excessive blood loss. In some cases, though, a blood transfusion is necessary."
Flying with small children: Checklist of questions to ask your airline,https://www.babycenter.com/0_flying-with-small-children-checklist-of-questions-to-ask-you_1460940.bc,"Traveling with small children brings its own set of hassles: Can you bring your own car seat on the plane? Will the gate agent announce preboarding for families with young children? Can you check a stroller at the gate?Airline policies change frequently, so it's a good idea to call ahead or check your airline's website every time you fly to make sure you know what to expect.Standard practices for airlines based in the United StatesMost U.S. airlines follow these policies on domestic flights (though it can't hurt to double-check before you buy your ticket):Typically babies must be at least 7 days old to fly. Some airlines allow younger infants with a doctor's written permission. Others extend the minimum age up to 14 days or have additional restrictions.Lap babies (younger than age 2) fly free on domestic flights, usually one per paying adult. (You may need to present proof of age.) This does save you money, but it's important to note that babies riding in airplanes are safest riding in government-approved car seats. (The label should read, ""This restraint is certified for use in motor vehicles and aircraft."")Your airline might allow you to bring your car seat on board if the flight isn't full, but there's no guarantee you'll get an extra seat if you haven't bought a ticket for your child.The FAA has banned the use of supplemental lap restraints, or ""belly belts,"" in airplanes. Booster seats and harness vests may be used during flight, but not during taxi, takeoff, or landing.Children age 2 or younger sometimes receive a special discount when you purchase a seat for them, especially when you're traveling internationally.When you buy a seat for your child, you'll need to bring a government-approved car seat for him to sit in on the plane. Airlines usually require that a car seat be placed in a window or middle seat away from exit rows. Some airlines impose additional restrictions.Children age 2 and up must have a ticket for their own seat.You can check your collapsible stroller when you board and pick it up as you exit the plane. Some airlines may require bulky and non-collapsible strollers to be checked at the ticket counter, however. It's a good idea to check your airline's stroller policy before your trip.Guide to Firsts: Plane travelPrepare for your baby's first flight with our handy checklist.Important questions to ask before you flyAirline policies for families vary widely. Many rules, including whether to allow preboarding, are at the discretion of the gate agent. The best advice is to call ahead and ask the following questions, but be prepared for possible changes at the gate.Is there a seat discount for a child younger than 2? (This question applies if you'd like to pay for a seat for your child rather than holding him in your lap during the flight.)Do you offer seat discounts for children 2 and older? If so, for what ages?Will you require proof of my child's age and identity? If so, what proof is required, and when do I present it? (As crazy as it sounds, some babies have been stopped from boarding because their names are similar to suspected terrorists on ""no-fly"" lists. Carrying a government-issued birth certificate or passport may help avoid such snarls.)Can we get seats in a bulkhead row? (Bulkhead seats have more room to stand and maneuver, but less room for stowing carry-ons.)Are bassinets available on the flight? When should I reserve one? (Bassinets are available only for lap babies, and can be used only in bulkhead rows.)Do all of your rows have extra oxygen masks? If not, can you seat us in a row that does? (This is important to ask if you're traveling with a child who doesn't have his own seat.)Do you allow preboarding for families with small children? If so, will there be a preboarding announcement or do we have to ask at the gate?Do lap babies get a baggage allowance?Does a car seat count as a carry-on? If I have to check it at the gate, does it count against my baggage allowance?Can we bring our stroller on board? Will it count as a carry-on? (This question applies if you want to wheel your child down the cabin aisle rather than checking your stroller when you board.)Do you have diaper-changing facilities on the aircraft? (Most large airplanes have one restroom with a changing table.)Do you offer children's meals? What's included? How far in advance should I order one?Can you warm my baby's bottle during the flight?Is in-flight audio or video entertainment for children available?Can my spouse or loved one get security clearance to accompany me to the departure gate if I need assistance?Do you offer assistance with maneuvering through the terminal when making connecting flights? How can I arrange for that?Additional questions to ask international airlinesKeep in mind that everyone  even a newborn  needs a passport to travel internationally. Make sure apply for your child's passport well before your trip.What do you charge for babies younger than 2? (For international flights, all children need a ticket, even those who sit on your lap and don't have their own seat. A lap baby's ticket often costs at least 10 percent of the price of a regular ticket.)Do you offer seat discounts for children age 2 and up?Can my child sit in his own car seat? If not, can the airline provide a car seat that's safe and appropriate for my child?If my child has a different last name, will I need additional documentation at the airport?"
Newborn screening tests: Which ones your baby will have and why,https://www.babycenter.com/0_newborn-screening-tests-which-ones-your-baby-will-have-and-w_1471069.bc,"What is a newborn screening test?Newborn screening tests check for rare but serious conditions in babies just after birth. All states require certain screening tests to be performed on newborns, even if they appear healthy. These generally include a variety of blood tests and a hearing test. (Some states now do heart defect screenings as well.)Most of the disorders your baby is checked for have no visible signs at birth. Catching these conditions early gives doctors a critical edge in treating them before they can cause your baby serious and lasting harm.Screening tests give only preliminary information that tells doctors whether to do more precise diagnostic testing, which is needed to determine whether there's truly a problem. The vast majority of screened babies are free of the conditions tested for. Only about one third of one percent of screened babies are actually diagnosed with something.When and where will my baby be tested?If you give birth in a hospital, the medical staff will take care of getting your baby's hearing and heart screenings done and will draw blood for the other tests by the time you leave. Typically they'll send the blood sample off to a state public health lab for analysis and the results will be sent back to the hospital. Your child's doctor will call you to let you know the next step if the results show any cause for concern.If you and your baby leave the hospital within 24 hours of birth, you might be asked to return in a week or two to finish the necessary testing. This is because some signs of the conditions being tested for don't show up until your baby's second day of life or later. In some states, no matter when you leave the hospital, they'll ask you to come back and have your baby's tests repeated at about 2 weeks of age, just to make sure nothing was missed.If you deliver your baby at home, take your newborn to a local hospital, clinic, or health department in the first few days of life to get blood drawn for screening tests. It's best to do this on day two or three  and no later than day seven. Your state's newborn screening program can provide more information about how to take care of screening after a home birth. What will my baby be tested for?It's up to each state to decide what to screen for, but most states now test for almost all of 31 core disorders. You can ask your baby's doctor what tests your baby will have. Or visit the Genetic Alliance's newborn screening clearinghouse to see an up-to-date list of conditions checked for in each state.Why don't all states screen for as many disorders as possible?Many factors go into determining what makes a newborn screening test worthwhile, and states come to their own conclusions about which tests make the most sense. Among the factors considered:Is the test good enough? Can it catch most cases of a disorder without mistakenly raising too many red flags for healthy babies?Will catching the disorder right after birth help? Is there an effective treatment for the disorder and does the treatment work best when offered as early as possible?Does the test make sense financially? Can the party who pays for it (usually the parent's insurance company or Medicaid, and sometimes the state) afford the test and the follow-up care and education that goes with it, and is the cost justified by the benefits of identifying the disorder?Will these tests hurt my baby?The blood tests require just one quick prick of a needle on your baby's heel to collect a blood sample. For the hearing test, a small, soft earphone is temporarily placed in your baby's ear. The screen for congenital heart defects, known as pulse oximetry, is also painless. Sensors are put on your baby's skin for several minutes to determine the amount of oxygen in the baby's blood and the rate of the baby's pulse. These procedures cause little discomfort. In fact, many babies sleep through them.What if they find something wrong with my baby?It's extremely unlikely that your baby will have one of the conditions being tested for. If there is something wrong, though, it's far better to know as soon as possible because many of the conditions can have severe consequences if left untreated, from intellectual disability to organ damage or even death. And most of the conditions can be improved or completely controlled with fairly simple measures, such as monitoring your child's diet or giving certain medications. What if I don't want my baby to undergo any newborn screening tests?In some states, parents have the right to refuse testing. (In fact, if you live in Maryland, Wyoming, or Washington, D.C., healthcare providers can't test your baby until you say it's okay.)But in a handful of states, you're not allowed to say no  the state believes testing is so important for your child's health that you have no legal right to refuse. Ask your healthcare provider what the rules are in your state if you're concerned.What if I want more tests than my state requires?Discuss your interest with your doctor and find out whether your hospital can perform the extra tests. If it can't and you need to find a laboratory that offers supplemental screening,check out the resources below.Where can I find more information?Visit the following websites:Baby's First TestSave Babies Through Screening FoundationEditor's Note: This article was reviewed by Richard Olney, medical epidemiologist at the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities.Show sources Hide sources Babys First Test.

How to find plus-size maternity wear,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-find-plus-size-maternity-wear_1504869.bc,"Jacqueline Tourville loves fashion. So when she became pregnant, she got excited about all the maternity styles she'd seen in popular magazines. She didn't expect to have a ""baby bump"" like the size 2 models and actresses who set the trends, but surely she could find clothes that conveyed her style even as her baby grew.What Tourville ended up finding was that those cute tops and skirts in the magazines don't come in her size.""After going shopping and seeing what maternity clothes were actually available for plus-size women, I quickly realized I would have to take matters into my own hands if I wanted to survive pregnancy with my sense of style intact,"" says Tourville, a size 22 and coauthor of Big, Beautiful, and Pregnant: Expert Advice and Comforting Wisdom for the Expecting Plus-Size Woman. ""Pregnancy brought out the fashion designer in me,"" she says.Most pregnant women lament the lack of attractive, affordable plus-size maternity wear. The good news is that more retailers, including Motherhood Maternity, Target, Gap, and Old Navy, are carrying plus-size maternity clothes. The bad news is that most of those clothes don't look anything like the fun, gorgeous, trendy maternity clothes featured in pregnancy magazines.""Sometimes I've found cute things, but mostly I've given up and wear the same three or four outfits over and over again,"" says Jennifer Mountain, a real estate contractor in Haslet, Texas, and mom of one.Mom-of-two Tourville says she was determined to avoid that fate  even if she had to learn some sewing skills to do it. Here she shares some of her secrets for how to create the maternity wardrobe you want.Wardrobe strategiesA few savvy tactics can turn a bleak-looking fashion outlook into a bevy of possibilities and opportunities.Embrace the empire.In her pre-pregnancy days, Tourville hated baby doll shirts  shirts with empire waists just below her bustline  because she thought they made her look pregnant. ""Now I can't stock my closet with enough of them!"" she says.She buys them in a size or two larger than her usual size. Sometime she cinches them just below her bust to really emphasize her growing belly, but usually they work as a fashionable maternity staple all by themselves. Her love of the empire waist style extended to formal wear. Dresses in this style, she explains, are ideal for fancy occasions.""For the office holiday party [the first time I was pregnant], I found a beautiful black baby doll dress at a thrift store. I sewed a red ribbon right along the empire seam line,"" she recalls.""The bright color drew lots of attention to my pregnant belly. I still remember all the compliments I got on that outfit. Many plus-size friends have asked to borrow this dress during their own pregnancies.""Get creative.To create a fitted-and-flared look with non-maternity tops, Tourville added mitten clips  those short pieces of elastic that have suspender clips at each end  to the back of the shirts, just below her bra line.Try boho skirts.You don't have to be a hippie to love a good prairie skirt. These full, elastic-waist skirts, purchased a size or two larger than your usual size, can last ""right up until your due date,"" says Tourville.She usually paired them with a tank top altered to fit snugly and emphasize her pregnant belly. Add dangly earrings and a funky scarf to complete the bohemian look.Save for big-ticket items.It's true that the more fashionable the plus-size maternity clothes, the more expensive they are. If you can afford it, save money to have one or two more expensive pieces.If that seems like a stretch, remember that those clothes will pay for themselves with repeated wearings and the joy they bring you. And many women find they can continue wearing some of their favorite maternity pieces even after pregnancy. Go for core items that you can mix with other pieces in your wardrobe: A really good pair of black pants, a flowy silk shirt in a solid color, a beautiful poncho or jacket.Let your mouse do the shopping.Many stores may not carry your size on the racks but have oodles of garments just for you in their online stores.Many web-only stores have clothes made to fit you Where to shop, below). And don't forget to search eBay, where lots of plus-size maternity wear is available every day.Use your phone as well: Customer service representatives can help you find pieces that will work well for you.Enlist friends.If you have plus-size friends, arrange to share your more fabulous plus-size maternity wear as each of you gets pregnant. That way, you save money, look great, and bond with your buddies.Create your own clothes.If you have a creative streak and some free time, supplement your wardrobe with some handmade pieces. You'll find patterns  which you can adapt to any size  as well as information, online sewing classes, and more at websites such as Makematernityclothes.com,Oldpatterns.com,Simplicity.com, and Voguepatterns.com.Where to shopSometimes it just takes trial and error to find something you like.

Dads-to-be: Diet changes to boost your fertility,https://www.babycenter.com/0_dads-to-be-diet-changes-to-boost-your-fertility_4188.bc,"Nutrition has a direct impact on the potency of your sperm. Research shows that having a poor diet and drinking alcohol regularly, for instance, can lower the quality and quantity of sperm and make conception more difficult. And since infertility is nearly as much a man's issue as a woman's  about a third of fertility problems can be traced to men  eating healthfully now can boost your chances of conceiving a child.Additional research shows that dads who are heavy drinkers risk damaging their sperm. If you drink, have no more than one or two drinks a day.Whether drinking coffee harms or helps your fertility is less clear. The safest bet is to drink no more than a cup or two a day.Which nutrients are most important?Your diet should be every bit as balanced, varied, and nutritious as your partner's. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, research shows that a healthy diet including plenty of fish, vegetables, and whole grains means more active sperm. On the other hand, a diet high in trans fats may lower the number of sperm in semen.Some specific advice for future dads:Eat plenty of foods rich in vitamin C and other antioxidants. These nutrients help prevent sperm defects and boost motility (movement). An 8-ounce glass of orange juice has about 124 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C. Aim to get at least 90 mg a day  more if you smoke (at least 125 mg).Get enough zinc. A lack of zinc can make sperm clump together and contribute to infertility. Great sources to help you get the 11 mg you need daily include oysters (16 mg in six medium oysters), extra-lean beef tenderloin (4.8 mg per 3-ounce serving), baked beans (3.5 mg per 1-cup serving), and dark chicken meat (2.38 mg per 3-ounce serving).Fuel up on folic acid. Studies suggest that men with low levels of this key B vitamin  the same one women need to reduce the baby's risk of neural tube birth defects  have trouble producing healthy sperm. You may be able to get the daily minimum of 400 micrograms from fortified breakfast cereals, leafy greens, legumes, and orange juice, but taking a folic acid or a multivitamin supplement for extra insurance can't hurt.Cut out (or cut back on) alcohol. An occasional drink is generally considered safe, but studies show that drinking wine, beer, or hard liquor daily can reduce testosterone levels and sperm counts and raise the number of abnormal sperm in your ejaculate.Take a multivitamin tablet every day. A pill is no substitute for a healthy diet, but a multivitamin can help you make sure you're getting the nutrients you need.Show sources Hide sources American Dietetic Association. Undated.

Sleep problem: Restless legs syndrome during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sleep-problem-restless-legs-syndrome-during-pregnancy_7549.bc,"What it isIf you feel an uncontrollable urge to move your legs to relieve crawling, tingling, or burning sensations, you probably have restless legs syndrome (RLS).You're not alone. One study of more than 600 pregnant women found that over 16 percent reported symptoms of RLS.At the end of your rope? Need sleep? Find practical ideas that might work for you here: Coping with restless legs syndrome: Pregnancy advice from moms-to-be.Symptoms usually show up when you're at rest, especially right before you fall asleep or when you've been sitting still for long periods, such as at the movies or during a long car ride. Most of the time, you'll feel the symptoms of RLS in your lower legs, but some women feel it in their feet, thighs, arms, or hands, too.Moving your limbs brings immediate relief, but the sensations return when you stop moving. Needless to say, this can be very uncomfortable and frustrating, especially when you're trying to sleep. If RLS keeps you from sleeping night after night, you could end up seriously fatigued.Fortunately for women who develop RLS during pregnancy, it's temporary. The symptoms typically peak when you're 7 or 8 months pregnant and disappear altogether by the time you deliver your baby or within a month afterward.What causes restless legs syndromeNo single cause has been identified, but research is ongoing. In addition to affecting a good number of pregnant women, RLS affects men, children, and women who aren't pregnant. And it seems to run in families. For women who already have RLS, it usually gets worse during pregnancy.No one knows why women who've never had RLS develop it during pregnancy, but there are a number of theories. Iron deficiency, folate deficiency, hormonal changes (specifically a rise in estrogen), and circulatory changes are all possible culprits.What you can do about restless legs syndromeThings to avoidMost drugs used to treat RLS are not recommended during pregnancy.Quinine (found in tonic water) is sometimes used to relieve RLS symptoms, but don't take it without talking with your healthcare provider first. Its safety during pregnancy hasn't been established.Even a small amount of caffeine can make RLS symptoms worse. If RLS symptoms are bothering you, you might try eliminating caffeine from your diet completely, if you haven't already.Some medications, such as the antihistamines in cold and allergy remedies, make the symptoms worse for some people. (So while Benadryl tends to make people sleepy, for example, it may actually intensify your RLS symptoms and make it harder for you to sleep.)Lying in bed reading or watching television before you go to sleep can make things worse. The longer you lie still, the more likely RLS will occur. Instead, get in bed only when you're actually ready to go to sleep.Things that might helpAsk your doctor or midwife about trying supplements such as iron, magnesium, vitamin B12, or folate. Depending on the quantities in your prenatal vitamin, your practitioner may or may not want you to take more.Some women find it helpful to stretch their legs, get a massage, use hot or cold packs, take warm baths, or practice relaxation techniques. Maybe your significant other will massage or rub your legs until you fall asleep. For lots more tips from moms-to-be, read our article about coping with restless legs syndrome."
Sleep aids for new parents,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sleep-aids-for-new-parents_7932.bc,"Some exhausted new parents are shocked to find that instead of falling asleep the minute their head hits the pillow, they suddenly can't get to sleep at all. If your normal bedtime routine isn't working, you may need extra help. Here are some ideas.Warm milkWarm milk before bedtime is a traditional remedy for insomnia. Milk, like many sources of protein, contains the amino acid L-tryptophan. Tryptophan raises the level of serotonin in the brain, which may help make you sleepy.However, milk contains relatively little of the sleep-inducing substances, so the soothing and soporific effects of warm milk may be purely psychological. But if it works for you, that's what counts!For variety, try adding a bit of vanilla extract or other flavoring.Herbal remediesHerbal remedies come in many forms, including the fresh or dried plant, pills, tinctures (a concentrated liquid extract), and powders.If you're breastfeeding or pregnant, consult your healthcare provider before taking herbs in any form. Herbs are considered a natural alternative to certain drugs, but they can be toxic and just as powerful as pharmaceuticals.Also, keep in mind that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration doesn't strictly regulate herbs and supplements, so the strength, purity, or safety of these products is not guaranteed. People may also react to them differently.The herbs recommended below are believed to be safe, but talk to your doctor if you have any questions about herbal remedies. To make a tea, follow the directions that come with the packaged or bulk herbs that you buy.ChamomileSome studies have found that chamomile has a mild calming effect, so having a cup of chamomile tea may soothe you before bedtime. It's also used to relieve indigestion, flatulence, gastrointestinal spasms, and inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract.However, some people have a strong allergic reaction to chamomile. If you're allergic to ragweed, chrysanthemums, marigolds, or daisies, you may not want to try this remedy because there's a good chance you'll be allergic to chamomile, too.HopsSleeping on a pillow stuffed with dried hops is another traditional remedy for sleeplessness and nervous conditions.You can also take hops as a bitter tea or as a freeze-dried extract in capsule form. Hops are a common ingredient in beer, but taken as a tea or in a capsule, there's no alcohol involved.LavenderSprinkle lavender oil on your pillow or put a few drops in a warm bath with lemon balm for a soothing soak.But note that not all lavender is conducive to sleep: Avoid Spanish lavender, which can be stimulating.Lemon balmLemon balm is a stomach-soothing sedative that's often combined with other calming herbs. Steep some lemon balm for a subtly flavored tea.PassionflowerPassionflower may sound like an aphrodisiac, but it's actually a mild sedative. (The name refers to Christ's passion and comes from the cross at the center of the flower.)You can make a cup of passionflower tea by steeping the dried herbs in boiling water.Passionflower is not safe for pregnant women, and resources from the National Institutes of Health recommend that breastfeeding women not take passionflower either.ValerianValerian has traditionally been used to treat anxiety and sleep disorders. Some experts recommend not taking valerian regularly for longer than four to six weeks at a time.Add the recommended amount of tincture to hot water or steep dried valerian root in boiling water for a bedtime tea. (If the strong smell doesn't appeal to you, try it in capsule form instead.)Over-the-counter medicationsAntihistaminesMost over-the-counter sleep aids and nighttime cold medicines contain anthihistamines, and some antihistamines do make you sleepy. (Other potential side effects are dizziness and dry mouth.)If you want that sleepy effect, check product labels for these active ingredients: brompheniramine, chlorpheniramine, dimenhydrinate, diphenhydramine, and doxylamine. (The antihistamine loratadine does not cause drowsiness.)If you're pregnant or breastfeeding, check with your doctor before taking any medication that contains an antihistamine. Don't take medicine that contains an antihistamine for more than two weeks at a time.MelatoninMelatonin is a naturally occurring hormone that's often recommended to prevent jet lag and insomnia. It's available in tablet and liquid form and can be found in most natural food stores.However, don't take melatonin if you're trying to conceive, pregnant, or nursing a baby: Little is known about its safety, side effects, interactions with drugs, or long-term effects.What if you still can't get to sleep?Sometimes making a few simple lifestyle changes can improve your ability to fall asleep. Stick to a regular sleep schedule, wind down before going to bed, and avoid alcohol, caffeine, and nicotine.Getting regular exercise can also help, and some evidence suggests that yoga improves sleep. You might also consider trying meditation or acupuncture.If you've tried various remedies and still can't get a good night's sleep, it may be time to consult a sleep therapist. Some use cognitive behavioral therapy to help people with sleep problems, including those that begin after you have a baby."
Breast preference: Nursing on one breast only,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breast-preference-nursing-on-one-breast-only_8492.bc,"Is it normal for a baby to prefer one breast over the other?Yes. Infants, especially newborns, may have periods of preferring one breast to the other. You may notice your baby fussing, pulling away, or simply refusing to suck from one of your breasts.What causes it?A newborn may reject one breast because it's harder to latch on to for some reason. The rejected breast may be more engorged or have a difference in the nipple, for example.An older baby may reject one breast because it has a low milk supply or a slower flow or letdown than the other breast. Your baby's breast preference can make the milk supply situation worse: You can end up with a low milk supply in one breast if your baby nurses more often from the other breast.Sometimes a baby will be more comfortable being held on one side than the other. If your baby seems to suddenly prefer one side, it may be because something hurts him. Maybe he has an ear infection in one ear, or maybe the side that he was just immunized on is tender, for example.If you've had surgery (or have another physical difference) in one breast, you may have a lower flow of milk in that breast. It's not common, but having cancer in a breast can also result in low milk flow. If you think that one of your breasts isn't producing as much milk as the other, talk with your healthcare provider.What can I do if my baby won't nurse from one of my breasts?Try to gently and persistently encourage your baby to nurse at the less-preferred breast by always offering that breast first, when he's hungriest. You can also try offering it when he's just waking up and perhaps still sleepy enough to take it. Experiment with different positions, and perhaps rock or sway your baby while nursing him.If you're consistently nursing from one breast, you'll want to pump or hand express milk from the other side to keep up production. You may need to use the expressed milk to supplement your baby's feedings. (Pumping will also help if you're concerned about looking lopsided.)If your child is getting enough milk and his breast preference poses no real adversity for you, there's no harm in letting your baby have his preference. There are plenty of women who have nursed successfully from one breast only.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a. Clogged milk ducts.

Breastfeeding after breast augmentation (implants),https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-after-breast-augmentation-implants_8680.bc,"ConditionBreast augmentation surgery (implants)The potential problemIf your breasts have been surgically enlarged with silicone or saline implants, your nipples may be more or less sensitive than normal.Once you've delivered a baby and your milk has come in, you may have exaggerated breast engorgement. You may also experience mastitis, with pain, fever, and chills that are more intense than usual.Can I breastfeed?Most likely. It depends on the kind of surgery you had, but most approaches are compatible with breastfeeding. Incisions made under the fold of the breast or through the armpit shouldn't cause any trouble. A ""smile"" incision around the areola increases your risk of having breastfeeding problems.SolutionYou won't know exactly how your milk supply has been affected by breast augmentation surgery until you try to nurse. If you still have feeling in the nipple, you have a much better chance of having a full milk supply.If you're able to produce only a portion of the breast milk your baby needs, you'll need to supplement with formula or donor milk.Let your baby's doctor know about your surgery. She'll need to keep a close eye on your baby's weight gain to make sure he's getting enough to eat.If you had surgery because you had underdeveloped (hypoplastic) breasts, you may have trouble producing enough milk. Use a pump after each nursing session to stimulate production.If you're thinking about getting breast implants and want to be able to nurse your babies, postpone surgery until after you've weaned your last child. This is a good idea anyway because your breasts can change so much when you're pregnant and nursing.Show sources Hide sources Bondurant S, et al. 1999. Safety of Silicone Breast Implants: Chapter 11.

Breastfeeding and herpes,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-and-herpes_8685.bc,"ConditionHerpes simplex type 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex type 2 (HSV-2)The potential problemHSV-1 is a virus that usually causes cold sores or fever blisters around the mouth, but it can also cause similar blisters anywhere on the body above the waist. HSV-2, also a virus, usually causes genital sores or blisters.Both forms of herpes can be passed on during skin-to-skin contact. In the United States, nearly 80 million people have some form of herpes. Herpes can cause serious infections in newborns because their immune systems are still developing.Can I breastfeed?Yes, with care. The herpes virus is not transmitted through breast milk. However, your baby could get infected by touching a blister or sore on your breast, mouth, or other area of your body.SolutionTo avoid spreading the virus, always keep clean clothing between your baby and any affected area of skin. Thoroughly wash your hands after using the toilet or touching a sore, and wash your hands and lay a clean towel or receiving blanket on your lap before holding your baby.If you have a blister on or around your mouth, do not kiss your baby until the sore has completely disappeared. And don't let your baby touch  with her mouth, nose, hands, or other body part  any blisters on your skin.If you have a herpes blister on your breast that's close to your nipple or areola, don't nurse from that side until the area has completely cleared up. Instead, express or pump your milk from that breast. If you can pump milk from the infected breast without letting your hands or any pump parts touch the sore, you can use the pumped milk to feed your baby. Otherwise, you must discard it. You may need to supplement your breast milk with formula or donor milk during these times. You can continue to nurse from the unaffected breast.Your healthcare provider may prescribe antiviral medications such as acyclovir or vidarabine (which is sold in eyedrop form) to fight the herpes infection and help prevent future outbreaks. These drugs are generally considered safe during breastfeeding, but consult with your baby's doctor about taking them while nursing. Or check Lactmed, the drugs and lactation database of the National Institutes of Health.Read about herpes during pregnancy.Show sources Hide sources La Leche League International. Undated.

Postpartum constipation,https://www.babycenter.com/0_postpartum-constipation_11707.bc,"Why am I constipated now?Even if you never had a problem with constipation during pregnancy, you may now. Give yourself a few days after delivery before you start worrying about it, though.If you had a long labor without food, bowel movements during labor, or an enema, you may go a day or two without defecating because there simply isn't anything in your intestines. And if you had a c-section, it can take three or four days for your bowels to start functioning normally again.If you continue to have problems moving your bowels after that, here's what may be going on:Systemic narcotics that you were given to ease discomfort during labor  or that you're taking now for postpartum pain  may be slowing down your digestive system.Having a sore perineum because of hemorrhoids, an episiotomy, or a tear may lead to constipation if fear of more pain  or needless worry about putting strain on your stitches  causes you to hold in your feces.Your constipation is more likely to go away within a few days if you take steps to address the problem.What can I do about constipation?Here are some tips for preventing and easing constipation:Never ignore the urge to move your bowels, even though it might be uncomfortable the first few times. The longer you wait, the harder your stool will get, which will only make your pain worse.Make an effort to eat high-fiber foods such as whole-grain cereals and breads, brown rice, beans, and fresh fruits and vegetables every day.Drink plenty of water. A daily glass of fruit juice, especially prune juice, can be helpful. Some people find that drinking warm liquid soon after waking up helps get things moving.Go for a walk. Walking may be painful at first, especially if you're recovering from a c-section or an episiotomy, but even a short trip around the block can help kick your sluggish bowels into gear.Ask your doctor or midwife whether you should take a stool softener (sold over the counter at any drugstore). You'll need to start taking one right away if you have a tear that extends into or through your sphincter. Stool softeners are also helpful if you're suffering from hemorrhoids or taking high-dose iron supplements for anemia or narcotics for pain relief.Is constipation ever serious?Not usually, but occasionally it can be a symptom of another problem. If you have severe constipation that is accompanied by abdominal pain, alternates with diarrhea, or you pass mucus or blood, call your doctor or midwife immediately.Also, straining during a bowel movement or passing a hard stool can lead to or worsen hemorrhoids, which are swollen veins in the rectal area. Hemorrhoids can be extremely uncomfortable, though they rarely cause serious problems. In most cases, they go away fairly soon after the baby is born. However, if the pain is severe or you have rectal bleeding, call your caregiver so you can be evaluated."
Postpartum hemorrhoids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_postpartum-hemorrhoids_11708.bc,"What are hemorrhoids?Hemorrhoids are varicose veins  blood vessels that have become unusually swollen  that show up in the rectal area. Hemorrhoids typically range from the size of a raisin to the size of a grape. They can be merely itchy or downright painful, and sometimes they can even cause rectal bleeding, especially during a bowel movement.Sometimes the enlarged veins protrude through the anus. When this happens, you'll feel a soft, swollen mass.Hemorrhoids are relatively common during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Some women get them for the first time while they're pregnant  and if you had them before you conceived, you're likely to get them again. Luckily, they often go away on their own (or with the help of some simple measures mentioned below) soon after you give birth.Why did I get hemorrhoids?Pregnancy makes you more prone to hemorrhoids, as well as to varicose veins in the legs and sometimes even in the vulva, for a variety of reasons.Your growing uterus puts pressure on the pelvic veins and the inferior vena cava, the large vein on the right side of the body that receives blood from the lower limbs. This pressure can slow the return of blood from the lower half of your body, which increases the pressure on the veins below your uterus and causes them to become enlarged.In addition, pregnancy brings an increase in the hormone progesterone, which causes the walls of your veins to relax, allowing them to swell more easily. Progesterone also contributes to constipation by slowing down your intestinal tract. Constipation often leads to straining, which can cause or aggravate hemorrhoids.You may also have developed hemorrhoids while you were pushing during the second stage of labor.6 things you'll need for postpartum recovery Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:29Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:29Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videos What can I do to get relief?Apply an ice pack (with a soft covering) to the affected area several times a day. Ice may help decrease swelling and discomfort. Some women find cold compresses saturated with witch hazel to be soothing.Soak your bottom in warm water, in a tub or a sitz bath. A sitz bath is small plastic basin that you fill with water and position over your toilet, allowing you to submerge your rectal area simply by sitting down. If you didn't get one at the hospital, you can buy a sitz bath at a drugstore. Try soaking a few times a day for ten minutes or so at a time.Try alternating cold and warm treatments. Start with an ice pack followed by a warm sitz bath.After each bowel movement, gently but thoroughly clean the affected area, using a peri-bottle (the plastic squirt bottle the hospital gave you to clean yourself). Instead of using dry toilet tissue, try using wipes premoistened with witch hazel (such as Tucks) that are made specifically for people with hemorrhoids.If you do use tissue, buy soft, white, unscented tissues, which tend to cause less irritation than varieties that are colored or scented. (If you have stitches in the rectal area, be sure to discuss aftercare with your practitioner.)Ask your healthcare practitioner to recommend a safe topical anesthetic or medicated suppository. There are many hemorrhoid-relief products on the market, but consult your practitioner before trying one on your own.Most of these products should be used for a short course of treatment only  one week or less. Continued use can cause even more inflammation. (Note: If you've had an episiotomy or a tear that extends into your rectum, it's especially important not to put anything  including suppositories  into your rectum until you're given the okay by your healthcare provider.)Take the pressure off your rectal veins to relieve the pain. Avoid sitting or standing for long stretches of time. Lie down when you can  when you're nursing, reading, or watching TV, for example.For temporary relief, you can take acetaminophen or ibuprofen, even if you're breastfeeding. (Do not, however, use aspirin or products containing aspirin if you're a nursing mom.) Don't take more than the recommended amount, and if the pain continues, talk to your midwife or doctor. How can I speed the healing process?Developing the following healthy habits can speed the healing process now and help you avoid hemorrhoids in the future:First and most important, avoid constipation: Eat a high-fiber diet (plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and beans), drink plenty of water (eight to ten glasses a day), and get regular exercise, even if you only have time for a short, brisk walk. You can also ask your healthcare provider about taking a fiber supplement or stool softener.When you feel the urge to have a bowel movement, don't wait. Waiting can make the stool drier and harder to pass. Also, to avoid putting pressure on the area, try not to strain when you're moving your bowels, and don't linger on the toilet.Do Kegel exercises daily. Kegels increase circulation in the rectal area and strengthen the muscles around the anus, decreasing the chance of hemorrhoids. They also strengthen and tone the muscles around the vagina and urethra, which can help your body recover after delivery.When should I call my practitioner?If your own relief efforts don't help  or if you notice bleeding  consult your practitioner. (Any rectal bleeding should be checked by your practitioner.) In most cases, hemorrhoids that developed during pregnancy will get better on their own, especially if you're careful to avoid constipation. In some cases, you may need to see a specialist for treatment to help shrink your hemorrhoids. Rarely, minor surgery is required to correct the problem."
How to help a gifted preschooler succeed,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-help-a-gifted-preschooler-succeed_64991.bc,"Exciting news  you just learned that your 3-year-old is indeed gifted, just as you suspected. But now what? Don't feel you have to rush to enroll him in a school for the academically gifted: You can do plenty at home and at regular preschool.How to stimulate your child at homeThe best thing you can do for your gifted preschooler is keep him busy with lots of mental challenges at home. That doesn't mean you have to start teaching formal academics right away  try to find ways to make learning fun instead. Here are some tips recommended by experts on gifted children:If your child speaks in complete sentences, answer in full sentences. He may get frustrated when adults don't engage him on his level.Let him play with games intended for older children. He may be bored with activities recommended for his age group.Encourage him to read and read to him. Books help children learn new information and think creatively.Provide him with creative art materials such as markers, chalk, big books of newsprint, pipe cleaners, clay, and scraps of fabric to help develop artistic ability.Enroll him in music or dance classes to encourage his nonacademic skills.Take him to your local library so that he can be exposed to the wealth of information there.Play games that feature letters and numbers.How to help a child who attends preschoolA preschool with a strong focus on academics can supplement your home enrichment activities. Work closely with the teacher so your child gets what she needs.Some childhood educators may not be trained to instruct gifted children, so discuss the possibility of making other learning opportunities available. Your child's teacher may be willing to:Let your child choose books that interest her. If she can read, have her read to the other children.Encourage model building, using either a kit or materials such as cardboard and egg cartons to construct various objects.Enrich her interest in math by giving her a workbook or assigning math projects (like arranging patterns with different shapes or building geometric forms).Cultivate her inventiveness with creative art projects, such as collages.Help her write a book or create a puppet show.What doesn't helpSometimes parents expect their gifted child to excel at everything, and that unrealistic expectation can put a lot of pressure on him. Here are some things to keep in mind:Try not to overwhelm your child with activities. He needs enough downtime to relax, read for fun, and just let his ideas percolate.Don't assume your child is capable of acting older than he is. Remember that having the intellectual capability of a much older child doesn't mean he has the emotional maturity as well. Gifted kids vary widely in behavior and social skills, so your child still needs your guidance.Show sources Hide sources Duke University. 2010. Myriad Myths about Giftedness.

Bowlegs (ages 2 to 4),https://www.babycenter.com/0_bowlegs-ages-2-to-4_66412.bc,"Could my child be bowlegged?It's absolutely normal for a baby's legs to appear bowed, so that if he were to stand up with his toes forward and his ankles touching, his knees wouldn't touch. Babies are born bowlegged because of their position in the womb.You may notice bowleggedness more as your child starts to stand and walk, but typically the legs gradually straighten out. By age 3, most kids no longer appear bowlegged. And by age 7 or 8, most children's legs have reached the angle they'll retain into adulthood.Rarely, bowlegs are caused by a vitamin D deficiency (also called rickets) or a condition called Blount's disease, a bone disorder that affects the shins. Even more uncommonly, bowlegs are caused by rare genetic disorders.How can I tell if my child is bowlegged?If your child stands with his toes forward and his ankles together and his knees don't touch, he's bowlegged. If his knees touch but his ankles don't, he's knock-kneed. (Being knock-kneed is generally most obvious between ages 3 and 6. Like bowleggedness, it usually corrects itself.)Should I mention it to the doctor?If your child is a baby or young toddler, the appearance of bowleggedness is probably normal. But if you're concerned, have the doctor check it out.If your child is just 2 years old or so, he may still appear a little bowlegged, but there should be some improvement from toddlerhood. If he's had his third birthday and his bowleggedness is still apparent, it's worth having the doctor take a look.At any age, it's worth mentioning to the doctor if you think it's extreme, affecting only one side, or getting worse instead of better.The doctor will probably examine your child and note his history. A blood test may be done to rule out a vitamin D deficiency and X-rays may be taken to rule out Blount's disease.If there is a vitamin deficiency, the doctor will prescribe a supplement. Your child may also be referred to a pediatric orthopedist for further evaluation or treatment.Can bowlegs be corrected?Treatment is rarely needed, but very occasionally surgery is used to correct a severe curve. Most experts today don't recommend braces or corrective shoes because they can cause problems with physical development.Show sources Hide sources Boston Children's Hospital. Undated.

My breastfeeding story: Latching trouble and bottle-feeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-latching-trouble-and-bottle-feeding_10414441.bc,"Name: JannaLives in: Puyallup, WABreastfeeding experience: Harder than expectedMain challenges: Trouble latching, slow eater, needed to bottle-feedBreastfed/pumped for: 14 monthsMy storyAmelia was breech at full-term so I had to deliver her via c-section. From day one, we had nursing problems. She had a tongue tie that prevented her from bringing the nipple into her mouth properly, and it probably didn't help that I had inverted nipples. Also her neck and jaw were very tight, so opening her mouth wide was a challenge.Trying to get her to latch on was just so, so hard. From the moment I tried breastfeeding, the hospital staff knew it wasn't going to be easy for me. I was frustrated. I had taken a breastfeeding class before giving birth, and I had read that it could be a challenging process, so I was prepared for that. But I didn't think it would be as bad as it was. I would cry and I felt so helpless. It was devastating as a new mom who just wanted to feed her baby.And I was really against giving my child formula. There's nothing wrong with formula, but I didn't personally want to use it. I supplemented with formula the first week for about 75 percent of feedings, but once we got going, she was exclusively on breast milk.For about six weeks, I worked on breastfeeding. I pumped too. We saw specialists to get Amelia's tongue tie clipped (and then re-clipped  it had to be redone). I saw so many lactation consultants  maybe two in the hospital, three or four in the clinic  because I really wanted to find a solution. And they said, ""Yes, you absolutely can get over these hurdles.""I nursed her for about three months, but I really struggled. She was a slow eater and sometimes she'd feed for 45 minutes. I basically felt like I couldn't go out because I didn't feel comfortable being out and nursing her  not out of modesty but because of logistics and comfort.So I decided to switch to the bottle. She could eat faster that way. I was okay with it  I was a little sad because I worked so hard to get her to breastfeed, but I felt like I had two choices: Wean and use formula, or wean her from the breast and feed her pumped breast milk by bottle. I'm just not a fan of formula  you always hear breast is best, and I didn't want her to be on processed food. So I chose to pump and bottle-feed.My body responded well to pumping; I made enough for her. I did that until she was 14 months old, then transitioned her to cow's milk.My biggest lesson learnedYou can prepare as much as possible and go to breastfeeding classes, but once you start breastfeeding, your child may not be a textbook case, and you might still be searching for answers. Find support online (like in BabyCenter's Breastfeeding Support and Help Group) so you don't feel alone.Back to all breastfeeding essays"
How will iron-deficiency anemia affect my birth options?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-will-iron-deficiency-anemia-affect-my-birth-options_10414722.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI have iron-deficiency anemia. Can I still have a normal birth?That depends on how severe your anemia is, and if it's being managed well.Mild anemia is unlikely to affect your pregnancy or your chance of having a normal birth. If your healthcare provider advises you to take iron supplements, and you take them as prescribed, your condition should improve. It's possible that by the time you give birth, anemia may disappear completely.Having anemia in pregnancy becomes a problem when it's severe and lasts a long time. (A hemoglobin level of 6 grams per deciliter or less is considered severe anemia.)If you have severe anemia, discuss your birth options in advance with your healthcare provider. You may want to see a specialist.Women with severe anemia are at greater risk of having a baby prematurely and also tolerate blood loss during delivery more poorly. Blood loss during delivery may mean needing a transfusion.But as long as your healthcare provider is aware of your anemia, you'll be monitored carefully throughout your pregnancy.Am I more likely to have a preterm birth?It's difficult to know for sure, but some research suggests that even mild untreated anemia can put a woman at risk for preterm birth.However, problems are more likely to occur with severe anemia: During the first two trimesters, severe anemia is associated with an increased risk of preterm birth. There's also the possibility that a baby may be born at a low birth weight.If a baby is born prematurely or has a low birth weight, she may need to spend some time in a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Due to her small size or weight (and not necessarily because of her mother's anemia), a baby likely won't have as much iron stored in her body as a larger or full-term infant. She may need to be given iron drops to replenish her iron stores.Will I need extra care during my labor and delivery?If your anemia is identified and treated, it's unlikely you'll have complications during labor and delivery. And if your provider knows you have anemia, she'll monitor you closely and give you extra care if necessary.But being anemic can sap your energy, and the increased fatigue can lead to having less stamina than usual. You also might experience dizziness, a rapid heart rate, or shortness of breath, which could make labor more difficult.If anemia is untreated and severe, your provider may consider your condition a high-risk pregnancy and refer you to a maternal-fetal medicine specialist.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

BabyCenter® Cost of Raising a Child Study,https://www.babycenter.com/0_babycenter-174-cost-of-raising-a-child-study_10415075.bc,"Parents Are Overspending on Their Children and Relying on Their Own Parents for Financial Support(San Francisco) - October 14, 2013 - BabyCenter.com, the #1 pregnancy and parenting mobile and web destination worldwide, today released its 2013 U.S. Cost of Raising a Child report, which examines the rising cost of having a baby. More than 1,200 BabyCenter.com moms completed the survey which found that parents spend an average of $13,000 per year on their kids. So it's no surprise that 66 percent of moms feel that parents spend too much on their kids  a 22 percent increase since 2012  and couples are worried about having enough money to start a family.""Children are expensive, but couples aren't letting that hold them back from starting a family,"" says Carmen Wong Ulrich, a BabyCenter.com financial expert. They are exploring ways of saving that they may not have previously considered, like moving back in with their parents or accepting money from in-laws. This can be a good short-term solution for couples to get them started, but they need to make sure they are taking the necessary steps to eventually become financially independent.All in the familyExpectant moms would like to save at least $4,500 before their baby is born, and some are turning to their parents for help. In fact, 10 percent of moms admit to living with their parents to save money in order to start a family. And the family support doesn't stop once the baby is born  nearly 30 percent of moms said they received financial help from their parents or in-laws during the babys first year.""Budgeting for baby is one the biggest challenges new parents face,"" said Wong Ulrich. ""A new baby can drastically alter a family's financial status, and parents need to be prepared."" A budget tool such as BabyCenter.com's Cost Calculator is a great way for new parents to get insight into their finances and start planning for independence.Getting pregnant isnt cheapToday it's not only raising a child that saps parents' wallets  even getting pregnant is a huge expense. Close to 50 percent of moms are spending money on products or services to encourage pregnancy, and it's adding up fast. From ovulation kits to vitamin supplements, women trying to get pregnant spend close to $500 to help them conceive.""It can take couples up to six months to conceive and all those prenatal vitamins, ovulation kits, and fertility tests can be costly,"" said Wong Ulrich. ""We also have to take into account that some couples need fertility treatment such as IVF or other medical interventions. The average cost of assisted reproductive techniques is $12,400 for a single try, which can be a real budget buster.""The Affordable Care Act is bringing big changes. BabyCenter answers moms' biggest questions about this legislation as well as helps moms figure out which essential items are now covered and how to get insured.Planning for maternity leaveHalf of BabyCenter's expectant moms say they plan to take three months off for maternity leave, and nearly 80 percent of them would take a longer maternity leave if they could. Though dads would like to have paternity leave, few get significant time off for it, and nearly 40 percent head back to work after just one week.""Since paid maternity leave is rare, most new moms end up using a combination of short-term disability, sick leave, personal days, and unpaid family leave to take time off from work to care for their newborn, which takes a chunk out of the cash flow,"" said Wong Ulrich. ""To ease financial concerns during this time, parents should aim to save up at least three months pay ahead of time. This will offset the paycheck that wont be coming in and provide a cushion in case of any emergencies.""Most families are feeling optimisticThough moving home and getting financial support from their parents may not be their ideal, the vast majority of moms are very optimistic about their future. Nearly 70 percent say they will be able to provide more for their children than they had growing up and the number of moms worried about having enough money to raise their children has declined approximately 10 percent in the last year.Analyzing family spending: Where is the money going?Parents admit to spending nearly $13,000 each year on their children, but where exactly is the money going? ""Housing accounts for a large percentage of parents' annual expenditure,"" says Wong Ulrich. ""Whether parents plan to renovate a room, expand their home, or move to a larger house, housing takes a big chunk of parents' wallets.""Childcare is another big drain on parents' bank accounts, especially working parents who need to arrange for daycare and after-school care. The remaining funds are allocated for transportation, food, entertainment, healthcare, and clothing.For more information on BabyCenter's 2013 U.S. Cost of Raising a Child report, please visit http://www.babycenter.com/child-cost. ###About BabyCenter LLCBabyCenter is the worlds partner in parenting.

My PPD story: Talk therapy worked,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-ppd-story-talk-therapy-worked_10415926.bc,"""For me, the most important thing was to be in control, to have the power to feel better without a pill.""My depression went beyond the ""baby blues""I got pregnant five months after my husband and I got married. It was unexpected good news, and I loved being pregnant. The possibility of postpartum depression didn't cross my mind, and my doctor didn't bring it up.Then, after my daughter was born, my physical recovery from the delivery was hard, and I felt overwhelmed and exhausted.I was breastfeeding, but my daughter didn't seem to be getting enough milk and was losing weight. Because she was born on December 20, it wasn't until after Christmas that I could get in to see a lactation consultant, who said my baby couldn't latch because of tongue-tie. Finally, on New Year's Eve, my daughter had the procedure to clip her frenulum so that she could nurse. Despite the procedure, however, breastfeeding was still difficult as well as painful for me.I rented a hospital-grade pump to keep up my milk supply and also started supplementing with formula so my daughter could gain weight. Feeding her was a constant, exhausting battle that fell primarily on my shoulders, since my husband had started traveling again for work after being home for only that first week.I was a hot mess. I would cry at anything. I was exhausted. The feeling I remember most vividly was the isolation. I felt alone in the world, like no one understood what I was experiencing. Scariest of all was the feeling that I didn't recognize myself  and wasn't sure I ever would again.By the time my baby was 3 weeks old, I was sure I had postpartum depression [PPD]  it was as if a big weight that would never be lifted was pressing down on me. It felt very heavy, dark, cloudy, and never-ending.When I talked to my mother, who has three children, and my father-in-law, a retired ob-gyn, both said, ""Don't worry, it's the baby blues."" My husband was compassionate, but that didn't help lift the isolated feeling.Finally, at 6 weeks, I told my doctor that I just wasn't myself and that I thought I had PPD  that this went beyond the baby blues. She agreed and said I had three options: take a pill, see a therapist, or both.I had an instinct that medication wasn't for me. I reasoned that if I took a pill and it made me feel better, I would never want to stop taking that pill, for fear the depression would return. Having worked in pharmaceuticals  including even selling an antidepressant  I knew too much about the complications that could arise, no matter how rare.But actually, side effects weren't my main concern. For me, the most important thing was to be in control, to have the power to feel better without a pill. I wanted to know that when I came out of my depression, I had done it on my own.What helped me when I was depressedBetween researching which mental health professionals near us had expertise in PPD and which of those accepted our insurance, it took me three months to connect with a psychologist. During that time, I felt increasingly desperate  I needed a lifeline.And so in the meantime, I also started researching other options, including dietary changes, that might help me feel better without medication. Thats how I figured out that certain foods  gluten, dairy, and soy, for example  made me feel worse, sapping my energy and making my brain feel foggy. I completely eliminated them from my diet, and benefited from that.When I finally started seeing my therapist, I felt immediate results. She helped me realize that I was not alone, that other women go through this, too.After six or seven months on the new diet, along with weekly talk therapy, I felt the depression lifting. I started to feel like myself again.I even felt confident enough to make a major change in my life. Wanting a career that was more fulfilling for me and worked better for our family situation  my husband and I were both traveling for work  I quit my job. I decided to go back to school and become a certified health coach. Now I have a business specializing in holistic self-care for moms.What I wish other moms knewListen to your gut instinct. You know yourself better than anyone else, so if you sense that something is off, that feeling is something to investigate. Don't be embarrassed by how you feel: Say something and ask for help.Know that the situation is temporary, even if it doesn't feel that way  you will love being a mother and you will stop crying and start smiling again.When I had a second child three years after the first, I was worried that the depression would return. But since I now know that being sleep deprived and alone triggered much of my PPD, we lined up help.My mom came for a couple of weeks, and we hired a night nurse who helped out several times a week. I continued my diet modifications and took time to take care of myself, even if that meant just making sure got my daily shower.

My breastfeeding story: Low milk supply after period returned,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-low-milk-supply-after-period-returned_10419216.bc,"Name: EmilyLives in: Ventura, CaliforniaBreastfeeding experience: Difficult and discouraging, but she pushed throughMain challenges: Nursing a preemie; low milk supply after period returnedBreastfed for: 7.5 months and countingMy storyGetting Michael to nurse right after he was born was a challenge. He was a preemie and was jaundiced, so we really had to push him to nurse. But he finally got it and was doing well until I got my period, about four months after he was born. I don't know why it came back so soon. I was told this was early for postpartum nursing moms.About 10 days before I got my period, things started changing with my milk supply. Michael started nursing a lot more frequently. He'd fuss a lot and it would take a good five minutes for my milk to let down. He'd want to nurse every hour! When I pumped, I would get half an ounce to 1 ounce, compared to the 3 to 5 ounces I'd been getting before. I thought I might have to give up breastfeeding!After I got my period I went to every expert I knew  my OB, his pediatrician, lactation consultants. My OB had my thyroid and progesterone checked to make sure all was okay, and the results came back normal.Everyone told me that this kind of thing sometimes just happens. I was so demoralized! Four of my friends had babies before me and none of them had problems with their periods and milk supply.Meanwhile, Michael wanted to eat every few hours. I went to my lactation consultant sobbing because I didn't want to give him formula. I was using the advice people gave me: I had already tried fenugreek and was drinking a lot of water. I didn't try giving bottles because I didn't like to pump, and I didn't want to struggle to get him used to taking them.My lactation consultant recommended that I take calcium and magnesium. She said your menstrual cycle can make your calcium levels drop, which for some women can affect milk supply. Her recommendation was to take these supplements starting the day I ovulated through the first day of my cycle, but I've taken them every day since.I stuck it out and continue nursing Michael as much as he wants. Every month my supply seems better. Now, when I get my period, it barely affects my breastfeeding. Letdown is a little slower, but it's fine. And Michael eats solid food now, too.Breastfeeding is nice and convenient, and I'm happy we're still doing it. Michael loves it, and I like how close I feel to him. It's nice quality time.My biggest lesson learnedStick with breastfeeding and it'll get better. Setbacks can be discouraging, but just keep going. Don't let other moms' difficult experiences make you think you can't do it.Back to all breastfeeding essays"
My breastfeeding story: More joyful than I'd expected,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-more-joyful-than-id-expected_10419221.bc,"Name: SarahLives in: Monroe, MichiganBreastfeeding experience: After a bumpy start, surprisingly easyMain challenges: Preemie delivery and a fluctuating supply of milkBreastfed for: 12 months and countingMy storyI never took a breastfeeding class, though I did read about it. I just figured: If it's going to work, it'll work. If not, then no big deal.My daughter was born five weeks early weighing only 5 pounds. Right away I started pumping because I was worried the nursing wouldn't happen easily. But she surprised everyone with a strong latch and nursed beautifully.It was meant to be, I told myself. Or maybe not, because suddenly I had too much milk. I started waking up engorged, which was really uncomfortable. So I did a little research and ended up buying a nursing bra. It gave me the support I needed so it wasn't as painful waking up every day.Then my milk supply dropped precipitously. It was when my daughter was 4 months old and I'd returned to work. I pumped twice during the work day but only had 15 minutes each time because I'm on such a tight schedule.I guess my body had performance anxiety because during those first weeks back at work I could only produce an ounce at a time. Since I'd read that every little bit counts, I just saved whatever I could pump and supplemented it with formula.My daughter's almost a year old now and I'm still breastfeeding because we both love it. I nurse her first thing in the morning and still pump twice a day at work. And I nurse her again when I pick her up from my parents' house.It's an extremely joyful time  she takes her hand and puts it across my chest and smiles. It's our bonding time. We give her solids, too, and she gets bottles of pumped milk when I'm away. We also have a nighttime feeding.I didn't expect to be nursing this long. And I'm not quite ready to give up. I think it'll be hard to say goodbye.My biggest lesson learnedEvery mother's experience with breastfeeding is different. Try not to get frustrated if you have problems, and take any scary story you hear with a grain of salt. I know I gave it my best shot and was blessed that it worked out. Be proud of trying, no matter the outcome.Back to all breastfeeding essays"
"My breastfeeding story: Needed formula at first, then phased it out",https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-needed-formula-at-first-then-phased-i_10419222.bc,"Name: SheridanLives in: Swansea, MassachusettsBreastfeeding experience: Caught off-guard by difficulties, but persisted and felt proud of what she accomplishedMain challenges: Preemie baby; had to rely on formula for a whileBreastfed for: 14 monthsMy storyI work at a hospital that actively promotes breastfeeding. As part of my job as a licensed dietitian, I read a 300-page manual on breastfeeding practices. So I thought I had it all figured out well before I had my son. Then Cameron was born a month early and transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Everything I thought I knew went out the window.The first sign things would go differently for us was after Cameron was handed over for skin-to-skin contact to initiate breastfeeding. He showed absolutely no interest. He didn't even search for the breast.I knew nursing doesn't always happen right away. What worried me was that he wasn't breathing all that well either. That's when the doctors took him to the NICU. They checked his breathing, tested his blood sugar, took his temperature, and put him under a heat lamp while I rested.About nine hours later I met with a lactation consultant and learned how to use the pump so I could feed Cameron my breast milk from a bottle, which they said might be easier for him. I reviewed the pumping process again with another expert when I visited him in the NICU. Both suggested I use a nipple shield, which can make it easier for preemies to latch on. We tried it and he latched on but had to work pretty hard to get anything. Apparently, this is often the case with babies who have respiratory issues. In hindsight I think the shield just made it harder for him.After three days in the NICU, we left the hospital. He still had trouble nursing so I was feeding him the colostrum I was able to pump and supplementing it with formula.It wasn't easy being home on my own. The word that comes to mind when I think of nursing him then? Combative. While trying to latch onto me, his arms flailed and he sometimes scratched me. After 10 to 15 minutes of this, my husband would take him and feed him formula while I pumped milk, which I'd then give him in a bottle. I basically just felt like, whatever it takes, let's make sure he's fed.When he was a month old I finally just quit the nipple shield to see what would happen  and he latched! It took a couple of days, but I couldn't believe I'd kept up pumping for an entire month and now there was an end in sight!Still it took time for me to feel confident that he didn't also need formula. I'd nurse him and, if he still cried, I'd top off a feeding with 2 or 3 ounces of formula. Eventually I learned to trust what my body was doing and, over time, decreased the amount of formula he was getting. By month three he was exclusively on breast milk.I went back to work after 15 weeks and pumped two to three times a day during work hours. In the hospital I have the luxury of a pump room with hospital-grade pumps, lounge chairs, and a window view.When Cameron was 12 months old, he was eating table food and I finally stopped pumping at work. I tried to continue breastfeeding at night but he didn't really show interest. He'd latch and then unlatch after a few minutes. By 14 months, he had weaned himself.My biggest lesson learnedBe confident that your body really can do the job. Breastfeeding was the hardest thing I've ever done but I feel like I rocked it. It was so rewarding when he finally latched on.Back to all breastfeeding essays"
Nanny care: Overview,https://www.babycenter.com/0_nanny-care-overview_45.bc,"If you prefer to have childcare come to you rather than have to deliver your child to home daycare or a daycare center each morning, a nanny may be a good option for you. Many parents also like the one-on-one attention for their child and the freedom to oversee everything from naptime to snacks that comes with hiring a nanny.Some nannies even have specialized training or experience in caring for newborns, multiples, or in helping babies and children develop good sleep habits.All this care and nurturing comes at a price, of course. You'll probably have to pay a nanny more than a daycare center costs, but many parents are willing and able to bear the cost. According to the International Nanny Association, as many as 1 million nannies work in the United States.What do the experts say?Experts who favor one-on-one care tend to prefer nanny care because it provides the focused attention that is especially important for infants. But a study by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development suggests that when it comes to childcare, what matters more is the quality of care, not the type.If you have a nanny who is not only experienced, reliable, and responsive, but also understands and nurtures your child's developmental and emotional needs, then you have a childcare arrangement that is pretty close to ideal. And if you supplement nanny care with playdates or other social opportunities, you have a situation that will grow with your child.Sometimes though, it can be hard to evaluate your nanny because you're not there to monitor her. (For help, seesigns of a good nanny.) If you're not confident your nanny is doing a stellar job, consider finding someone else or looking for a high-qualitydaycareorhomecarearrangement instead.Top questions about nanny careIs the nannylicensed?What are theadvantages and disadvantages?How do Ifind a nanny?How much willa nanny cost, and how should I pay her?What are thesigns of a good nanny?What are thesigns of a bad nanny?How do Imake the relationship work?The bottom lineAlthough the idea of having someone care for your child in your home sounds like the perfect arrangement, it does take some effort to find and keep a good nanny. Being a good employer is important if you want her to stay.There are also legal issues to consider when employing a nanny. But if you're not fazed by the other paperwork involved in hiring a nanny and are willing to invest the time in building and maintaining a strong relationship with her, it could be a great option for you and your family."
Rectal bleeding during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_rectal-bleeding-during-pregnancy_260.bc,"What could cause rectal bleeding during pregnancy?Rectal bleeding is typically caused by hemorrhoids, which are blood vessels in the rectal area that have become unusually swollen. Hemorrhoids are relatively common during pregnancy, particularly in the last trimester and in the weeks after giving birth. If you strain during a bowel movement, pass hard stools, or rub when you wipe, these swollen veins may bleed.Anal fissures are another cause of rectal bleeding. These painful cracks in the skin of the anus may be caused by passing hard stools as a result of constipation, which is common during pregnancy.When should I call my practitioner?Let your caregiver know about your bleeding. If you see blood on toilet tissue or in your panties, it can sometimes be difficult to tell whether the blood is coming from your rectum or your vagina. Your practitioner can determine this.Rectal bleeding is not usually a sign of a serious problem in women of childbearing age. But your caregiver will need to examine you to make sure.Bleeding caused by hemorrhoids and anal fissures usually stops on its own, particularly if you make changes to keep constipation at bay. If you're tried the measures below and the bleeding continues or you have severe pain, you may be referred to a specialist for treatment. Tips for constipation during pregnancyWhat causes constipation, and how can you prevent it?What can I do to prevent this problem?Both hemorrhoids and anal fissures are often brought about and irritated by constipation, so staying regular can help. Here are some tips for preventing and easing constipation:Eat high-fiber foods such as cereals, whole-grain breads, and fresh fruits and vegetables every day. Add a couple of tablespoons of unprocessed wheat bran (available at health food stores) to your cereal in the morning and follow it with a glass of water.Drink plenty of water. A glass of fruit juice each day, especially prune juice, can also be helpful.Exercise regularly. Walking, swimming, and yoga can all help ease constipation and leave you feeling more fit and healthy.Listen to your body. Never put off going to the bathroom when you feel the urge.Ask your healthcare provider about taking an over-the-counter fiber supplement.Iron can be constipating. Ask your healthcare provider whether it makes sense to temporarily switch to a prenatal vitamin with less iron.And here are some additional suggestions for preventing and soothing hemorrhoids:Do Kegel exercises daily: Tense the muscles around your vagina and anus and hold for eight to ten seconds before releasing and relaxing. Repeat 25 times. Kegels increase circulation in the rectal area and strengthen the muscles around the anus, decreasing the chance of hemorrhoids. They also strengthen and tone the muscles around the vagina and urethra, which aids in postpartum recovery.Some women find comfort with an ice pack or cold compresses soaked in witch hazel, while others swear by a heating pad. Try alternating hot and cold treatments: Start with an ice pack followed by a warm sitz bath.Use soft, unscented, white toilet tissue, which causes less irritation than colored, scented varieties. Moistening the tissue can help, too. Or use moist towelettes saturated with witch hazel instead.Ask your healthcare practitioner to recommend a safe topical anesthetic or medicated suppository. There are many hemorrhoid-relief products on the market, but consult your practitioner before trying one. Most of these products should be used for a short course of treatment only (a week or less). Continued use can cause even more inflammation."

Breastfeeding as a working mom,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-as-a-working-mom_641.bc,"Can I continue to breastfeed once I return to work?Yes, you can. If you live near work or have on-site or nearby daycare, you may be able to take nursing breaks to feed your baby. If that's not possible, you have two choices:Option 1: You can keep up your milk supply by using a high-quality electric breast pump to express milk during the workday. Your child's caregiver can give your baby bottles of your expressed breast milk. (You can also supplement with formula if you can't produce enough milk.) You'll still be able to nurse your child whenever you're not at work.The U.S. Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), signed into law in 2010, requires employers to provide moms of babies younger than 12 months a reasonable break time for pumping and a private place to pump, other than a bathroom. (Employers with fewer than 50 employees don't have to comply if compliance would create ""undue hardship."") For more details, read this U.S. government fact sheet.Option 2: If you can't or don't want to pump at work, you can gradually replace daytime feedings with formula while you're still at home but continue to nurse at night and in the morning. Remember, though, that if you don't nurse or pump during the day, your milk supply will diminish.Breastfeeding Problem SolverFind solutions to a variety of breastfeeding challenges, including nipple pain, low milk supply, and more.What are the advantages of pumping at work?Pumping at work stimulates your milk production, so you'll have plenty of milk available when you nurse. Your baby will have the health and nutritional advantages of breast milk even when you're not there. What's more, pumping can be a wonderful way to feel connected to your baby during the workday.You'll save money by not buying formula (or not as much of it). And you may avoid missed workdays, because breastfed babies are half as likely to get sick in their first year as those on formula.One of the best things about continuing to breastfeed is coming home to a baby who wants to nurse. You get to snuggle right away, re-establish your bond, and nurture your baby in a way no one else can.To make sure your baby will want to nurse when you get home, ask your caregiver not to feed him during the last hour of the workday, or to feed him just enough to take the edge off any hunger. Then you and your baby can look forward to a warm reunion every day.Show sources Hide sources DOL. Undated. Fact sheet 73: Break time for nursing mothers under the FSLA.

Potassium in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_potassium-in-your-pregnancy-diet_655.bc,"Why you need potassium during pregnancyPotassium, a mineral found in many types of food, plays an important role in maintaining the balance of fluids and electrolytes in your body's cells. Potassium is also important for sending nerve impulses and helping your muscles contract.Your blood volume expands by up to 50 percent during pregnancy, so you'll need slightly more electrolytes (sodium, potassium, and chloride, working together) to keep the extra fluid in the right chemical balance.If you suffer from leg cramps during pregnancy, you might check whether you're getting enough potassium because a lack of this mineral (or sodium, calcium, or magnesium) could be the culprit.How much potassium you needPregnant and nonpregnant women: 4,700 milligrams (mg) per dayBreastfeeding women: 5,100 mg per dayFood sources of potassiumFresh fruits and vegetables are among the best sources of potassium. To give you a sense of how easy it is to get this important mineral from your daily diet, here's a list of some of the foods highest in potassium:one medium baked potato with skin: 926 mg1/2 cup dried plums: 637 mg1/2 cup raisins: 598 mg6 ounces prune juice: 528 mg1/2 cup cooked lima beans: 485 mg1/2 cup cooked acorn squash, cubed: 448 mgone medium banana: 422 mg1/2 cup cooked spinach: 420 mg6 ounces tomato juice: 417 mg6 ounces orange juice: 372 mg1 cup raisin bran cereal: 362 mgone medium cooked artichoke: 343 mg1 tablespoon molasses: 293 mg1 medium tomato: 292 mg1 ounce sunflower seeds: 241 mgone medium orange: 237 mg1 ounce almonds: 200 mgShould you take a supplement?It's probably not necessary. A wide variety of foods contain this important mineral, so it should be fairly easy to get all the potassium you need from your diet.The signs of a potassium deficiencyLow potassium is most often the result of chronic or severe vomiting or diarrhea, or from using certain diuretics, rather than a shortage in your diet.A shortage of potassium could cause weakness, fatigue, muscle cramps, constipation, and abnormal heart rhythms. Talk with your doctor if you suspect that you're short on potassium or any other nutrient.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014.

Phosphorus in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_phosphorus-in-your-pregnancy-diet_676.bc,"Why you need phosphorus during pregnancyPhosphorus is a mineral that helps build strong bones in you and your developing baby. (About 85 percent of all the phosphorus in your body is found in your bones.)This mineral is also important for muscle contractions, blood clotting, kidney function, nerve conduction, tissue and cell repair, and normal heart rhythm. Phosphorus helps the body generate and use energy.How much phosphorus you needWomen age 19 and older: 700 milligrams (mg) per dayWomen age 18 and younger: 1,250 mg per dayPhosphorus needs are the same for all women throughout adulthood  whether or not you're pregnant or breastfeeding. Food sources of phosphorusHere are some good food sources of phosphorus:3 ounces Chinook salmon, cooked: 315 mg1 cup plain, nonfat yogurt: 306 mg1 cup nonfat milk: 247 mg3 ounces halibut, cooked: 244 mg3 ounces light turkey meat, cooked: 217 mg3 ounces chuck steak, cooked : 179 mg1/2 cup lentils, cooked: 178 mg1 ounce almonds: 136 mg1 ounce part-skim mozzarella cheese: 131 mg1 ounce peanuts: 108 mgone large egg, hard boiled: 86 mgone slice whole wheat bread: 68 mg(Note that 3 ounces of meat is about the size of a deck of cards.)Should you take a supplement?No, you can easily get all the phosphorus you need from a well-balanced diet (even though most prenatal vitamins don't contain phosphorus). For example, 1 cup of yogurt provides nearly half of your phosphorus for the day.In order for your body to absorb phosphorus properly, it must be balanced withcalciumand combined with vitamin D  that's why dairy products are such a good source of this mineral.Phosphorus deficiencies are very rare and usually seen only in cases of starvation. Signs include weakness, anemia, loss of appetite, and loss of bone mass.Show sources Hide sources AND. 2014.

The official term is autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The condition is described as a spectrum because there are many possible symptoms, ranging from mild to severe.The first signs of autism appear in early childhood  even babies may have autism symptoms. Doctors are getting better at identifying autism, but parents are often the first to notice something different about their child.Children with autism sometimes have trouble reading facial expressions and gestures, which can make it hard for them to understand what other people think and feel. Children with autism may also have difficulty expressing themselves and communicating their needs.Other common symptoms include repetitive body movements (like arm-flapping) and sensitivity to stimuli like loud noises, bright lights, and certain smells and textures.No two children have the exact same symptoms. Some children with ASD can repeat an entire passage they've memorized from a book but can't hold a conversation. Others can read at a fourth-grade level by age 6 but still need help buttoning their pants.Currently, 1 in 68 children in the United States has autism, and the rate is rising.What are the signs of autism?Most children with autism in the United States are diagnosed around age 4, but signs of autism usually are evident by age 2. And at least some symptoms of autism are noticeable much earlier, even though they may go unrecognized.Some parents notice early signs of autism before their child's first birthday, and most suspect something is amiss by the time their child is 18 months old. Problems with communication, social development, and fine motor skills may be noticeable as early as 6 months.""One of the first concerns parents may have is that their baby is not babbling or using sounds and words communicatively,"" says Jennifer Sharpless, speech-language pathologist at the Kennedy Krieger Institute's Center for Autism and Related Disorders.In some instances, a child develops typically until he's 1 or 2, and then regresses. He may have developed communication skills right on schedule, for example, and then stopped progressing or lost some of the skills he had.Getting a diagnosis also may happen much later than age 3 or 4 in low-income areas, in rural areas far from major medical centers, and in Latinoand African American communities. Children who have less severe autism are also more likely to be older at the time of diagnosis.See our comprehensive list of autism signs and symptoms.What causes autism?No one knows for certain, but both genetic and environmental factors appear to contribute. Some experts believe there could be many causes.""The primary cause appears to be genetic, as evidenced by the high rate of identical twins who both have ASD,"" explains Sally Ozonoff, endowed professor and vice chair for research at the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the UC Davis MIND Institute. ""However, not all identical twins both have ASD, so there must also be nongenetic factors that can put children at risk for autism.""There are many theories about other possible causes, such as viruses, gastrointestinal problems, and food sensitivities, but there's no solid research to support these claims.Some people remain suspicious that vaccines play a role, but most scientists and researchers say there's no evidence of a link betweenautism and vaccines.A journal article published in the late 1990s claimed there was a link between the MMR vaccine and autism, butthe study was retracted and the research discredited for ethical and scientific reasons.And numerous studies have concluded that there is no link between the MMR vaccine or thimerosal and autism. (The MMR vaccine never had thimerosal, but people sometimes confuse the issue.)In addition, thimerosal  a mercury-containing compound used as a preservative  has been nearly eliminated from childhood vaccines in the U.S. since 2001, yet autism is still on the rise.What are the risk factors for autism?There's no way to predict which children will have autism. But there are some risk factors that make it more likely, including:Sex  boys are four to five times more likely than girls to have autismHaving a sibling with autismHaving another developmental disorder, such as Down syndrome or fragile X syndromeBeing very premature or low birth weightHaving an older mom or dadHaving a mom who took certain medications during pregnancy, like valproic acid.How is autism diagnosed?There are no medical tests for autism. Doctors screen for the condition using specific behavioral signs and guidelines. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says that it's possible to get a reliable autism diagnosis by age 2.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that your baby's doctor look for early signs of autism at thewell-baby checkupsregularly scheduled at9,18, and 24 months. Identifying autism spectrum disorder as soon as possible helps families get assistance through early intervention programs.If you have any concerns about your child's development,discuss them with his doctor. (You can also have your child evaluated free of charge through local early intervention programs.)At the evaluation, the specialist will ask you about the behaviors you've observed in your child, such as whether he babbles or points to objects. If you've noticed anything at all that worries you, be sure to mention it.If the doctor is concerned your child may have autism, she'll refer you to professionals with expertise in the disorder. In addition to a developmental pediatrician, neurologist, or psychologist, your child may also see an audiologist (to test for hearing), a speech therapist, and an occupational therapist. They may evaluate your child's body movements, verbal communication, listening skills, adaptability, and social skills.How is autism treated?Early intervention can make a big difference in a childs long-term outlook. It can increase a child's desire to interact with other people and help with specific daily living skills, like potty training and getting dressed. Children who begin therapy before age 3 generally have the greatest gains, but it's never too late to get help for your child.The needs of children with autism vary widely, depending on their symptoms, and many therapies can help. The best treatment programs are the ones that are customized for your child.Options include:Behavior therapy.This type of therapy is often based on an approach called applied behavior analysis, or ABA. It uses positive reinforcement to encourage desired behavior.When a child masters a particular skill, such as making eye contact or participating in a conversation, he gets a reward or praise. Unwanted behaviors may be ignored, or privileges may be taken away. Kids start with small skills and gradually work up to more complicated ones.Sensory integration techniques.Children with autism often have trouble integrating information from their senses. They may withdraw when people try to touch them, be hypersensitive to smells and certain fabrics, dislike getting dirty, or want to be in constant motion. Treatment involves challenging the child to tolerate stimulation.Relationship-based developmental interventions.These techniques use specific play-based interactions to boost a child's interest in other people and help him enjoy being social, along with helping him master developmental milestones. Examples includeRelationship Development Intervention,Early Start Denver Model, and Floortime.Many of these techniques are child-directed, meaning they follow a child's natural interests while challenging him to master social, emotional, and intellectual milestones. For example, if a child is tapping a toy car, you would encourage him to build on that activity. You might imitate the tapping, or put your car in front of him to boost back-and-forth communication.Speech, occupational, and physical therapy.Speech therapy can improve a child's language and social skills. An occupational therapist can help a child with such self-help skills as learning to zip up pants as well as play skills, like learning to navigate the monkey bars at the park. And a physical therapist can help a child develop motor skills and improve posture and balance. Is there medication to treat autism?There is no drug to treat autism. But a child's doctor may prescribe medication to treat a particular behavior or condition associated with autism, including seizures, anxiety, depression, insomnia, irritability, impulsivity, and hyperactivity.Some parents report success withalternative therapies, such as supplementing their child's diet with vitamin B6 and magnesium, probiotics, or omega-3 fatty acids. However, no well-designed studies have been done to demonstrate that these treatments are effective, and some can be harmful. You'll want to talk with a doctor before giving your child any kind of supplement or alternative therapy.What other conditions are linked to autism?Children with autism often have other challenges. The CDC reports that nearly one-third of children with ASD also have an intellectual disability, and 10 percent have another genetic condition, such as Down syndrome or fragile X syndrome.Many children with autism have other health issues, including depression, anxiety, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Children with autism are also prone to sensory problems and insomnia. About one in three has seizures.What about Asperger's syndrome and PDD-NOS?Doctors used to divide autism into several distinct disorders or ""subtypes,"" includingAsperger's disorderandpervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS).But the waypsychiatrists diagnose autismchanged recently, so doctors and therapists no longer categorize autism this way. Now mild and severe types of autism are combined into a single diagnosis of ASD.Although parents of a child who previously received a diagnosis of Asperger's disorder or PDD-NOS may continue to refer to it that way with a doctor or therapist, eventually the term will disappear from use.No matter what term is used to describe a child's autism, the most important thing is for the child to get the treatment and services he needs.How do I get autism services and treatment for my child?There are certain services all children with autismshouldget  though what is available to your child depends in large part on which state he lives in.Birth to 36 months.There are free public programs in every state for children with developmental disabilities from birth to 36 months. These early intervention programs help with education, social and communication skills, and different types of therapy.Age 3 and up.Federal lawguarantees that all children with autism (or any disability) age 3 and up receive a free education in the same classroom with children who aren't disabled. (That is, unless a child is so disabled that he benefits more from a separate classroom or school setting.) Most children with autism attend public school  either in a regular classroom or a special education program  and receive extra help, like speech or occupational therapy as needed.To find out about special programs for your child, call your local elementary school and ask to speak to the person in charge of special education. Once your child is enrolled in a program, the school will prepare an individualized education program (or IEP) for your child, outlining goals for your child and what services will be necessary to reach them. You probably will also meet with school staff, such as a special education teacher, to help develop a program for your child.Read more aboutautism services.What about my childs friends?Children with autism typically exhibit unusual behavior, and other kids may find it difficult to relate to them. Part of preparing a child with autism to interact socially involves teaching very specific skills, such as how to make eye contact, join a group, and hold a conversation.Although children with autism show their emotions differently, it's not true that they don't form bonds. A child with autism may not like to be cuddled, but he's capable of forming deep attachments to others, including parents, siblings, other children, and teachers.What does the future hold for a child with autism?With the right treatment, therapy, and support, children with autism are much more likely now than in the past to become independent and develop healthy relationships with others by the time they reach adulthood.Success depends largely on the severity of a childs autism and the help he receives. Some adults with autism function independently, working and living on their own and getting help only as needed with major tasks such as difficult paperwork or finances.But most, says Ozonoff, require continued assistance and support in adulthood. Some remain at home with their parents. Others live in a supervised group setting, such as homes or apartments staffed by professionals trained to help with tasks like meal preparation and personal care.Where can I get more information?Many organizations provide information, resources, referrals, and support for parents of children with autism. Remember that many other parents just like you are dealing with the challenges of raising a child with autism. Many are eager to offer emotional support and practical help.Here are some good places to start:Autism Speaksprovides news about autism, opportunities to participate in research and events, and a way to connect with other parents.

Colic: How to cope,https://www.babycenter.com/0_colic-how-to-cope_1369745.bc,"I think my baby has colic. What can I do?If your otherwise healthy baby cries for more than three hours in a row, on three or more days a week, for at least three weeks, then it's probably colic. (Yes, that's a lot of crying.) Colic peaks around six weeks, and then tapers off to an hour or two of crying by the time your baby is 3 or 4 months old.Babies with colic can have lengthy bouts of crying at any time during the day, and sometimes their crying gets worse in the evening. It can be rough on parents, who are desperate to soothe their baby but have a hard time finding anything that works.It's a good idea to check with your baby's healthcare provider first to rule out any medical condition that could be causing your baby's crying. If your baby is healthy, and colic is indeed the problem, try the tips below for soothing your baby. Your baby's doctor might have some suggestions too.Try a gentle massageYour baby might enjoy a gentle massage, but be sensitive to how she responds. She may feel overstimulated. (Chiropractic care has not been proven helpful with colic.)Make some noiseBabies like sounds that remind them of the rhythmic heartbeat and gentle whooshing noises they heard in the womb. Your baby might find it comforting to sit in his infant seat near the clothes dryer as it's running or snuggle in a front carrier while you vacuum. Or he might calm down when the exhaust fan is on in the kitchen.You can also search online for soothing sounds like rainfall or other constant, natural noise.HushSome babies are comforted by motion, noise, and activity, but others need less stimulation and respond better to quiet, stillness, and darkness.Move itGentle motion can be soothing, so try rocking your baby. You can put her in a baby swing, but if your baby falls asleep in the swing, it's safest to move her to a crib.It might be easier for your baby to settle if you walk around the house carrying her in a front carrier or sling. She may prefer being held higher in the pack, close to your chest and your heartbeat. Or try gently bouncing up and down in this position while hugging your baby close.Hit the roadIf you've been indoors, it may help to take your baby for a walk in a stroller, sling, or front carrier. The new sights, sounds, and smells may distract her, and the fresh air and rhythmic movement of walking may calm her enough to fall asleep.On the other hand, if you've been out and about with your baby all morning, some quiet time at home might be just what she needs.Try a different positionYour baby might be most comfortable cradled in your arms, or he might prefer a more upright position, or even lying tummy-down across your lap. Try different positions when he's upset to see if he seems to prefer one position over another.SwaddleThink about how snug your baby was before her birth, and you'll have a good idea how wide the world seems to her right now. Swaddling  wrapping your infant snugly in a blanket or cloth  can help a baby feel less out of control. You can try swaddling your baby during feedings if she has trouble settling down enough to eat, or wrap her up before her usual colicky period or before you put her down to sleep.Not only might swaddling help your colicky baby get to sleep, there's a good chance it will help her stay asleep, too.Researchers have found that babies who are swaddled sleep more soundly than those who aren't. That's because when a baby twitches during sleep, her own movements can wake her up. Swaddling keeps that little twitch from becoming a full-fledged flail she's unlikely to sleep through.It's best to keep your swaddled baby where you can keep an eye on her to make sure she doesn't roll onto her stomach and wind up face down on the mattress. To reduce this risk, stop swaddling your baby when she's about 2 months old (or is able to roll over).Bathe your babyA warm bath in the middle of your baby's colic time might distract and relax him. Some babies are soothed by the spray of a handheld nozzle on their back. Your baby may enjoy the rhythmic pulsing of the warm water as well as the sound.Offer a pacifierAnything that helps your baby calm down is a lifesaver right now. For some babies, sucking is the ultimate soother. Consider offering her a pacifier, or encourage your baby to suck on her finger by gently putting it in her mouth.Ease a gassy tummyGas doesn't cause colic, but some colicky babies also suffer from gassiness because they tend to swallow air while crying. Keep your baby upright during feedings, and burp him often to try to ease gas pain.Use a (warm) hot water bottleSome babies enjoy the feeling of warm water against their belly. Fill a hot water bottle with lukewarm water and wrap it in a towel. (Don't make the water too hot  what feels warm to you might be too hot for your baby.) Place it on your belly and let your baby lie on top of you.Try probioticsStudies have shown that babies with colic have different gut bacteria than babies who don't have colic. Probiotics helped reduce colic symptoms in some of these babies, though the American Academy of Pediatrics says it's too early to know whether probiotics work well enough to use for all colicky babies. If you'd like to give probiotics a try, ask your provider to recommend a probiotic for your baby.Is it possible my baby can't tolerate certain foods?Another cause of tummy trouble that mimics (but doesn't cause) colic is an intolerance or an allergy to cow's milk protein or other food. If you think that might be causing your baby problems, here are some things to try:Adjust your diet if you're breastfeedingIf you think your baby may be sensitive to something in your breast milk, talk to your healthcare provider. It may help to eliminate all dairy products for a couple weeks. (That's how long it takes for the cow's milk protein to be cleared from your milk.)If that doesn't do the trick, consider taking a look at foods other than dairy products. There's plenty of controversy about which ones are problematic (and the data is conflicting), but potential suspects include caffeine, wheat, eggs, nuts, onions, and cabbage.Take a break from eating likely offenders for a few days to see if you can identify any troublesome foods that might be making your baby uncomfortable. Reintroduce them one at a time, waiting to see if your baby reacts to one item before adding another. The process takes a while, but it might save your baby some crying time.Ask about a formula changeAgain, formula doesn't cause colic, but switching kinds may be worth a try if your baby is crying excessively. Ask your baby's doctor about switching to a formula that has partially or extensively hydrolyzed cow's milk protein. Are there any medicines or supplements that ease colic?Other than probiotics (mentioned above), you can try gripe water or antigas (simethicone/mylicon) drops sold over-the-counter. Neither one has been proven effective, but they are commonly used for gas pain in babies and are generally considered safe.Don't give your baby any of these in an effort to calm her down:Infant cereal or other solid foods. Your baby isn't ready to digest solid food, and giving them to her won't help her feel better.Medications such as antispasmodics or antihistamines. These can be unsafe for your baby.Herbal teas or supplements. Some studies show that certain herbs can relieve colic, but they can also be unsafe because the strength, dosage, and quality of the herbs can't be guaranteed. That's why many experts advise against giving herbs to your baby, while others recommend that you only do so under the guidance of your baby's doctor.Talk with your doctor before giving your baby anything other than breast milk or formula.How to keep your sanityAn inconsolable baby is a tough trial for a new parent. It's enough to make you cry. Go ahead. Also keep in mind:It's not personalWhen your baby rejects your attempts to console her or seems angry with you, remind yourself that she's too young to comprehend the concept of blame. And while there are ways to try to console her, colic has nothing to do with your parenting skills.You can't do it aloneShare baby care with your partner. Have a friend or relative take over for you once in a while so you can take a peaceful walk or a refreshing shower.If you find yourself becoming angry or frustrated with your baby, take a deep breath and gently lay her in her crib. Then call a friend or a relative to come and stay with your baby while you calm down.If there's nobody you can call to come and support you in person, contact a local crisis hotline or a child abuse hotline. The people who staff these phones know how to help.You're helping your baby, even if she's still cryingYou may not be able to keep your baby from crying. In fact, it's possible that crying is exactly what she needs to do, and you can best help her by respecting and accepting that. Continue to hold her, rock her, whisper to her  and let her cry, all the while assured of your love.Learn more:Best tricks for soothing a crying babyWhat I wish I'd known about soothing a fussy baby12 reasons babies cry and how to soothe them5 tips for soothing a colicky baby Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:43Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:43Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

How to eat when you're trying to conceive,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-eat-when-youre-trying-to-conceive_1460692.bc,"If you're trying to get pregnant, practicing good eating habits now can help you have a healthy pregnancy once you conceive.""What you eat affects everything from your blood to your cells to your hormones,"" says Cynthia Stadd, a nutrition specialist at the Berkley Center for Reproductive Wellness in New York City.But no matter how balanced your diet is, it's still important to take prenatal vitamins to reduce the risk of having a baby with neural tube defects. Most experts recommend that all women start taking folic acid at least a month before trying to get pregnant.Read on for more tips about eating a healthy diet while trying to conceive.Curb caffeineIt's unclear whether caffeine can affect fertility. There's some evidence that very high consumption  more than 500 milligrams a day, or about three to four 8-ounce cups of coffee depending on the strength of the brew  might interfere with fertility. But experts generally agree that low to moderate caffeine consumption (less than 300 milligrams a day, or about two 8-ounce cups of coffee) shouldn't make it harder for you to get pregnant.What does your OB-GYN want you to know before getting pregnant?

Fruits and vegetables deliver a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, and getting enough of certain nutrients is especially important before you conceive.For example, veggies like spinach, romaine lettuce, asparagus, and broccoli are high in the B vitamin folate. (Folic acid is the synthetic form.) Eating foods rich in folate during preconception and pregnancy can help prevent neural tube birth defects, such as spina bifida. Produce that's high in vitamin C  such as citrus fruit, strawberries, broccoli, and tomatoes  can help your body absorb iron more easily, and iron is an important mineral for women who become pregnant. (See ""Pump up your iron intake"" below.)In general, choose fruits and vegetables in a range of colors to get the most nutritional bang for your buck. (Eating a produce ""rainbow"" gives you a wider variety of nutrients.) Choose fishSeafood is the best source of omega-3 fatty acids, and according to some scientists, these essential fats may have a positive effect on fertility. Research suggests that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids may help regulate ovulation, improve egg quality, and even delay aging of the ovaries.Omega-3s are also important for a baby's brain and eye development and could have many other pregnancy-related benefits. These include lowering your risk ofpreterm birth, reducing your chance of preeclampsia, and easingdepression.On the other hand, you've probably also heard that some types of fish contain contaminants such as mercury. In high doses, this metal is harmful to a baby's developing brain and nervous system.The good news is that not all fish contain a lot of mercury. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that women trying to conceive can safely eat up to 12 ounces (roughly two or three servings) a week of fish like canned light tuna, salmon, shrimp, cod, tilapia, and catfish.However, the FDA advises limiting white (albacore) tuna and completely avoiding fresh or frozen swordfish, tilefish, king mackerel, and shark because these have the highest mercury levels.You can take fish oil supplements if you don't like seafood, but first talk to your doctor about which brand to buy and how much you should take.Read our article oneating fish when you're trying to conceivefor more advice on mercury and omega-3s.Pump up your iron intakeFill your body's iron reserves before you get pregnant, especially if your periods are heavy. According to Sam Thatcher, a reproductive endocrinologist and author ofMaking a Baby: Everything You Need to Know to Get Pregnant, ""Bleeding every month is a constant source of iron depletion.""Make sure to get enough iron now  once you're expecting, it's difficult for your body to maintain its iron level because your developing baby uses up your stores of the mineral. (Pregnant women need double the amount of iron they needed before pregnancy.)Too little iron at conception not only can affect your baby, it can also put you at risk for iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy and after you give birth (especially if you lose a lot of blood during delivery). Anemia causes your red blood cells to fall below normal and saps your energy.If you don't eat much red meat, or if you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, your healthcare provider may recommend that you take a prenatal vitamin containing extra iron. And to be on the safe side, ask your healthcare provider to test you for anemia at your preconception checkup. Eat whole grainsA woman trying to conceive should eat as many nutrient-rich foods as possible, and whole grains are a great place to start, says nutrition specialist Stadd.The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food guidelines recommend that you make at least half of the grains you eat each day whole grains (such as bran cereal, oatmeal, brown rice, or whole wheat bread). Refined carbohydrates (like white bread, pasta, and white rice) won't directly lower your chance of getting pregnant, but they do shortchange your body because the refining process strips grains of key nutrients such as fiber, some B vitamins, and iron.Note: If you havepolycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS), the most common cause of infertility in women, pay extra attention to the types of carbs you eat. PCOS is a hormonal imbalance that can get worse when insulin levels in the bloodstream surge, and refined carbohydrates are a main cause of insulin spikes.Mark Leondires, fertility specialist and medical director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of Connecticut, explains that when women with PCOS eat too many refined carbohydrates, insulin flows into the blood, feeds back to the ovaries, and can lead to irregular ovulation.Avoid alcoholAn occasional beer or glass of wine probably won't hurt your odds of conceiving, but having two or more drinks a day can. Moderate drinking can also increase your risk of miscarriage. You may want to skip alcohol completely when you're trying to conceive because it can be hard to tell exactly when you get pregnant, and alcohol can harm a developing baby.For nonalcoholic alternatives, see our list of thebest ""virgin"" drinks.Be aware of listeriaListeriais a bacterium that can contaminate lunchmeats, soft cheeses, and unpasteurized dairy products. Pregnant women are more likely than other healthy adults to get sick from eating contaminated food, and the infection caused by listeria (listeriosis)can cause amiscarriageearly in the first trimester  possibly before you even know you're pregnant.To kill listeria, heat high-risk foods in the microwave until they're steaming hot. To reduce bacteria growth on leftovers, set the refrigerator's temperature to 40 degrees or less. Toss any food that's been at room temperature for more than two hours.Do not eat these foods:raw fish and sushi, refrigerated smoked seafood (like lox), soft cheesemade from unpasteurized (raw) milk, other unpasteurized dairy products, and refrigerated pt or meat spreads. (Canned or shelf-stable spreads are safe to eat.) Choose other proteinsProtein is a critical part of a healthy diet, but according to the USDA, many Americans rely too heavily on beef, pork, and chicken to get their daily amount. In a study of 18,555 women, experts at Harvard Medical School found that those who included one daily serving of vegetable protein  such as nuts, beans, peas, soybeans or tofu  were less likely to have infertility due to ovulation problems.More research is needed on the link to fertility, but because vegetable proteins are usually lower in fat and calories than steak or fried chicken, including them in your meal plans is both good for you and a great way to maintain a healthy weight.To get a personalized nutrition plan that includes the amount of protein, grains, and produce you should eat daily, try the USDA's SuperTracker tool.What about hisdiet?When it comes to fertility and diet, men don't get a free pass. Lisa Mazzullo, an ob-gyn and assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, recommends that fathers-to-be take a daily multivitamin that contains zinc and selenium for at least three months before conception. Studies suggest these minerals aid in healthy sperm development.Why start so early? The sperm your partner ejaculates today was actually created more than two months ago. It takes about 74 days for sperm to fully develop and benefit from the supplementation.""Genetic preparation is going on during sperm development, so that's pretty heavy stuff,"" says Amy Ogle, a registered dietitian in San Diego, California, and coauthor ofBefore Your Pregnancy: A 90-Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception.Learn more:Dietary changes men can make to boost fertilityFolic acid: Why you need it before and during pregnancyPrenatal vitamins: Why they're so importantEating fish when you're trying to conceive: How to avoid mercury and still get your omega-3sUSDA SuperTracker tool: Get your personalized nutrition planShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

Tips from breastfeeding veterans,https://www.babycenter.com/0_tips-from-breastfeeding-veterans_8478.bc,"Nursing is a different experience for every mother and baby, so what works for one woman may not work for the next.That said, there are plenty of time-tested techniques for improving milk flow, clearing blocked milk ducts, and more. Read on to find out how BabyCenter moms faced, and overcame, some of the most common breastfeeding challenges.I attended a class offered at the hospital. It gave a lot of the basics along with the encouragement that if breastfeeding wasn't easy at first, baby and mom eventually would find their rhythm. R.L.Don't watch the clock to see how often or how long your baby is nursing. Instead, go with your instincts. If your baby is rooting around or crying, then feed him or her  even if you just did. GinaMake sure your baby's mouth covers a large part of the underside of your nipple. I spent the first few weeks in a lot of pain because my baby wasn't latching on properly.

See all videosI'm a pediatrician mom of a 3-year-old whom I breastfed for eight months. My son was extremely hard to start: Despite making our first attempts (unsuccessful) in the first hour and knowing what to do, it took almost two days to get him latched on. In the interim, we finger-fed with an SNS (supplemental nursing system) and glucose water while I pumped to get my milk supply going. The SNS was a lifesaver. We finally hooked it to my breasts and were able to get him latched on by the third day. DaraI used lanolin ointment on my nipples faithfully morning and night and never experienced any cracking or bleeding when I started nursing. My soreness was minimal, and the ointment soothed my skin when it was chafed. I have very fair, thin skin, so that was a wonderful tip for me! I included a tube with my shower gift to a friend. RachelI've been solely nursing my baby since birth and now, at 9 weeks, she's a big healthy baby. I had very sore latch-ons at the start, and I found that if I stayed ahead of her intense hunger I was better off. I would check on her around the time I thought she would be waking to eat and watch for tongue-sucking and lip-smacking in light sleep. If I put her to the breast when she showed early signs of hunger, she wouldn't suck as hard as when I waited until she was fully crying and really hungry. KathyThe best  and probably hardest  breastfeeding advice is to relax! Remember that you and your baby are learning.

See all videosWhen I had my daughter, I knew I wanted to breastfeed. Unfortunately, she didn't latch on right away, so I began supplementing with formula. Hospital staffers tried everything from round-the-clock attempts to pumping and inserting feeding tubes in the baby's mouth while I tried every nursing position known. The baby knew how to suck, but she just wasn't getting the knack of it. Finally, we tried the plastic breast shield. My baby was able to suck the large plastic nipple and draw the milk rather than search for my small nipple.I had visions of using the shield from then on, but luckily I lost it and was forced to teach the baby to take my own nipple. I had to use a syringe to ""pull"" the nipple larger, but in time, thanks to the baby's suckling, my nipples conformed. The rewards for not giving up have been great! AlisonI've had a real problem with leaking breasts. The nursing pads never worked well enough for me, so I came up with my own solution  sanitary napkins! I buy the ultra-thin kind and fold them in half. I can wear them all day and they never leak. It's cheaper, too. CindyFor me, preparing for nursing meant reading all I could. I had several magazine subscriptions going while I was pregnant and almost every issue had an article on breastfeeding. I found new facts and ideas in each, but the bulk of the article was the same. Every time I read these articles, it reinforced all the information I had previously read. When the time came to put it all to use, I felt pretty confident. I felt like I really understood what was coming next and as a result, breastfeeding seemed relatively easy. GingerWhen I started breastfeeding, I felt like I needed two or three extra hands. I was so nervous about holding my newborn and supporting his head properly that trying to get him in the right position to latch on seemed impossible. It wasn't until several months later that I got a breastfeeding pillow as a gift. It's amazing. It props the baby up into the perfect spot so I can concentrate on the latching-on, which is the hardest part when you're new to nursing. I wish I'd had one of these when I was learning to nurse and fumbling around with ordinary pillows and blankets and propping and leaning. LauraThe single most beneficial thing I did was to attend a La Leche League meeting while I was pregnant. I learned a tremendous amount and got to see other women nurse their babies, which I had never really seen before. After my baby was born, I continued to attend LLL meetings and have received a great deal of knowledge, support, and encouragement from the leaders and the other mothers. I also made some terrific friends. DebbieMy mother gave me a great tip for getting through those first couple of weeks when breastfeeding hurt: Drink very cold water through a straw as the baby is latching on. The cold water will help defer the pain. Other things that help include listening to relaxing music and minimizing distractions so that you can relax and focus on the task at hand. WendyWhen my daughter was born, I told my lactation consultant about my horrible experience with mastitis and bleeding nipples when I breastfed my first child. She recommended some products that have worked great: lecithin, for avoiding clogged milk ducts; blessed thistle, for increasing milk flow when I return to work and need to pump; and alfalfa, for enriching my milk. I haven't had any episodes of mastitis. I swear by the herbs  they've made all the difference! RuthTake all the help and support you can get. The lactation consultant got my husband involved in the learning process so he would know how to help me get the baby latched on until I was able to do it by myself. CandiceThe best advice I got for dry and sore nipples came from my doctor. She said not to bother buying those expensive ointments but instead, after breastfeeding, express just enough milk to spread on the nipples. It really does work with the dryness and cracking. AnonymousDuring those early stages, I frequently got blocked milk ducts. When I could feel the full duct even after Doug had fed, I'd put on the warming bag (the kind that you heat in the microwave). I'd also take one ibuprofen tablet. The next time I fed him, I'd start with that breast and massage and ""milk"" the duct as he sucked. Sometimes I'd keep the warming bag on as he sucked. Usually after three or four feedings it would clear. LaurieI'm a mom of five breastfed babies, expecting the sixth this month. I think one of the hardest things is the constant demand on your time and body. It helped me to look at nursing as our special time together. You'll have bumps in the road, but don't give up. eatonmemMake a nursing tool kit. Get a basket or tote bag and fill it with things you'll want on hand while nursing: a refillable bottle of water (one with a pop top spout is great for one-handed maneuvering); an energy bar; something to read; baby nail clippers (it's a great time to get those nails, especially if your baby dozes off); a pad of paper and pen (for jotting down all the things you want to do if you ever get a chance); your cell phone; lanolin for sore nipples; a burp cloth; and so on. angelinasolRelax. I continued to pump after I went back to work and was able to breastfeed my firstborn for almost a year. One day at lunch, I came home to pump and my husband was also there. We got into an argument while I was pumping. Normally I would produce plenty of milk in ten to 15 minutes. Apparently I was so emotionally distressed, my milk would not let down. After 20 minutes, I had less than 2 oz, and it was time to go back to work. When I explained to my husband why we didn't have enough milk the next day, he was much more supportive during pumping time. I never would have noticed this unless I was pumping, so I wanted to share with all the breastfeeding moms out there. AnonymousWhen my son was born, we were told he was tongue-tied but his pediatrician said it wasn't a big deal. I started breastfeeding, and soon I had sores on my nipples. It hurt the whole time he nursed, every time he drew milk out. A week after I left the hospital, I went back to see the lactation consultant, and she reiterated that my baby was tongue-tied. She said that he couldn't extend his tongue far enough to suck properly, and that instead, he was chomping on my breast to get the milk. The next day, we had his frenulum clipped a little (he was fine right afterward, no lasting pain), and now he sucks just fine. SheriMy son was born rooting! But he was also born with a teeny tiny mouth and I have large breasts and large nipples, so we had a rough time getting started. I figured out that if I squish my nipple down, much the same way you squish a cheeseburger, he can latch on and eat to his heart's desire! He is 3 weeks old and growing like a weed. I'm so glad I stuck with it and figured out what works best for us. MollyExpect the best. While these comments are wonderfully helpful in terms of tangible tips and support, I imagine that some readers who haven't yet breastfed might read them and expect all kinds of difficulties if they choose to nurse. I just want to say that I delighted in breastfeeding for ten years straight (four babies in a row, each into toddlerhood) without a single snag. I'm not boasting  just reassuring readers that they won't necessarily have problems breastfeeding! KarenShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2016. FAQ029. Breastfeeding your baby.

Breastfeeding a baby with special needs,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-a-baby-with-special-needs_8481.bc,"The benefits of breastfeeding a baby with special needsLearning to breastfeed can be difficult for any new mother, but if your baby is born prematurely, or with a congenital condition such as Down syndrome or a cleft lip or palate, breastfeeding becomes even more challenging. Nursing can be a calming respite from the emotional ups and downs of raising a special-needs baby, though, and your child will reap the nutritional and immunological benefits of breast milk, which can be especially valuable for a baby with special needs.""A baby with a cleft lip or palate, for example, is often more prone to developing upper respiratory problems such as colds, allergies, and ear infections,"" says Aimee Creelman, a lactation consultant and obstetric nurse at Brattleboro Memorial Hospital in Southern Vermont. ""Many studies show that these babies do much better when they get their mother's milk.""Breast milk can help prevent the respiratory infections and bowel problems that are common with Down syndrome, too. And because it's easily digestible, breast milk also helps babies with heart problems or cystic fibrosis gain needed weight.""Breast milk can help protect your baby from infections during surgery and help them heal afterward,"" says Jan Barger, a lactation consultant in Wheaton, Illinois. ""Sometimes a mom feels helpless while the doctors are busily trying to help her child, but breastfeeding is something that only Mom can do for her baby.""Breastfeeding may also comfort a mother through some of the rough patches of mothering a baby with special needs, says Barger, and may help her feel closer to her baby as well.5 simple breastfeeding positions Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:47Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:47Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videos Challenges of nursing a special-needs babyBecause a baby's special needs may affect his ability to suck, he may need a little extra help when it comes to breastfeeding.For example, a baby with a cleft lip or palate, which is the fourth most common birth defect, may have difficulty latching on to your breast. The cleft palate, an opening in the roof of the mouth that goes up to the inner chambers of the nose, makes it hard for a baby to create an airtight seal on the breast.Your baby's sucking ability will depend on the size of the cleft, as well as on the size of your breast and the compressibility of your areola (the circle of skin surrounding your nipple).""A compressible, soft areola works best for a baby with a cleft palate, because if the breast is soft enough, it can press into the palate and suction can be created,"" Creelman says.Some babies with Down syndrome do well at breastfeeding. But some may have muscles that are either poorly developed (""hypotonic"") or too stiff (""hypertonic""). Either condition can make it difficult to position him at your breast.In addition, he may not have the energy to suckle effectively and transfer milk well enough to gain weight.The small jaw and receding chin that are symptomatic of Pierre Robin syndrome, a rare condition, can also make it very difficult to breastfeed.Just because your baby has been diagnosed with one of these conditions doesn't necessarily mean you won't be able to nurse. ""The amount that a disability affects breastfeeding depends on the degree and type of the condition,"" Barger says. ""The only condition that I know of where you absolutely can't breastfeed is galactosemia, when the baby can't metabolize lactose (the primary sugar in breastmilk)."" Tips for successfully nursing your baby with special needsAlthough the challenges are different for different conditions, many of the solutions are similar. The first step is to establish your milk supply. If your baby doesn't take to your breast immediately, start pumping as soon as possible after the birth and pump every two to three hours, as often as a baby would nurse.It's also important to make sure you stay well-nourished and well rested. ""There's a lot of stress and anxiety for a mom whose newborn is in intensive care and that can affect milk supply,"" Creelman says. ""Our emotions play a big role in our milk's ability to let down.""It's easy to become overwhelmed by concern for your baby and your desire to establish a bond, but these emotions can become detrimental to breastfeeding. ""I always encourage moms to try and approach the first feeding without too much expectation,"" says Creelman. ""The first feeding attempts are times to snuggle and let the baby be close to your breasts. Just let it be a good, close bonding experience.""Sometimes this connection can lead naturally to breastfeeding. Creelman recommends kangaroo care, or cuddling skin-to-skin with blankets over you and your baby.""This helps the mother build her milk supply and can often segue into breastfeeding,"" she says. ""Sometimes the baby will just start licking and rooting and moving her head toward the breast. It's just one of those magic moments.""Read more about how to bond with your premature baby in the neonatal intensive care unit.Once you have established your milk supply and created a bond with your baby, it might be necessary to try specialfeeding positionsor equipment. A baby with Down syndrome or who was born prematurely with poorly developed muscles needs a lot of physical support of the head and upper back.Creelman recommends the football position, in which you hold your baby under your arm on the same side you're nursing from, so you can support the baby's chin and jaw with the same hand that's supporting your breast.On the other hand, if your baby's muscles are stiff, he may tend to arch her body when you try to nurse her. In this case, it may help to swaddle her before settling in to nurse. (Watch our video on how to swaddle a baby.)Positioning is also critical for a baby with Pierre Robin syndrome. Because of the underdeveloped muscles in herjaw and throat, the baby's tongue can actually fall back in her mouth when she's trying to breastfeed while on her back or side. Unless she is positioned virtually on her stomach, with Mom lying beneath, she will not be able to breathe.If your baby is sleepy or placid (as is the case with many babies who have Down syndrome or other neurological disorders), you'll want to wake her up completely before breastfeeding and nurse her frequently throughout the day. Breast compression will help keep your milk flowing (and your baby from dozing while she's feeding). It can also help a baby who isn't sucking well.To use breast compression while breastfeeding or pumping, place your hand around your breast, thumb on one side, a couple of inches back from the nipple. As your baby nurses, alternately apply and release pressure.Sometimes, despite your best efforts, a baby with special needs is slow to take to the breast. Until she's breastfeeding effectively, you can help your baby get the nourishment she needs with the help of some special breastfeeding equipment, such as Lact-Aid or the Supplemental Nursing System (SNS) by Medela.These systems consist of a small bottle with a feeding tube. You fill the bottle with breast milk that you've pumped (or supplemental formula, if your baby needs it), then hang the bottle around your neck and tape the tube to your breast. When your baby nurses, she takes both your breast and the feeding tube into her mouth.You can also make a similar feeding system using a number 5 French feeding tube that's 36 inches long and a baby bottle or syringe without a needle. (These supplies are available at medical supply stores.) It would be helpful to have a lactation consultant show you how to set up and use an SNS.""An SNS decreases the length of time feedings take, and you don't run the risk of creating a nipple preference for the bottle,"" Barger says.It's generally best to avoid bottles and pacifiers, because a baby may get used to the feel of the rubber nipples and refuse to go back to the breast, a situation known asnipple preference.But in some cases, a bottle can help. For babies with a cleft palate, for example, Creelman recommends the Special Needs Feeder, a bottle made by Medela. ""It has a soft silicone nipple that's a bit elongated and a chamber so the person who is doing the feeding controls the flow, based on how well the baby's doing,"" Creelman says.Another helpful accessory is a nipple shield, which gives more definition and firmness to the nipple. ""This can help a baby who is having difficulty latching on,"" Barger says.Don't hesitate to try aids for breastfeeding if they're needed, but it's a good idea to try breastfeeding without them first. ""In general, you want to use as few interventions as possible and make things as natural as you can,"" says Barger.By the way, a fairly common condition called tongue-tie (or ankyloglossia) can also affect a baby's ability to nurse. Learn about breastfeeding a baby with tongue-tie. Where to get more helpBabies with special needs should have routine checkups with a pediatrician to ensure that they are developing normally and healthily. You'll also need emotional support from your doctor, partner, and family, since learning to breastfeed your baby will require a lot of patience and flexibility.""One of the best things to do is talk to other mothers who have been there,"" says Barger. Your hospital should be able to refer you to a support group. You can also try these resources:La Leche League International (LLLI) provides support for breastfeeding mothers.

4 key nutrients you may be missing,https://www.babycenter.com/0_4-key-nutrients-you-may-be-missing_10352387.bc,"In a perfect world, we'd get all the nutrients we need from well-balanced home-cooked meals. Unfortunately, with today's jam-packed schedules and on-the-go dining, we're likely to fall short on critical nutrients.Revamp your diet to make sure you include the following key nutrients and you'll not only function better, you'll help stave off disease and may even extend your life.Omega-3sResearch shows that consuming a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the risk of heart disease. Omega-3s DHA and EPA do this by helping prevent irregular heartbeats, reducing plaque buildup and inflammation in the arteries, and keeping blood sugar levels in check.Need more reasons to load up on omega-3s? Researchers from the National Institutes of Health report that they're more effective at combating depression than commonly prescribed antidepressant drugs.Where to find them:Fatty fish like salmon, trout, and sardines. (Some plant foods contain the omega-3 ALA, but this fatty acid hasn't been proven to provide the health benefits of DHA and EPA.) Eating just one or two servings of fatty fish a week can slash your risk of dying from heart disease by 36 percent. Not into fish? Take a supplement.Vitamin DFor years, scientists thought vitamin D's only role was to enhance the absorption of calcium from food. New research shows that vitamin D can reduce chronic pain, ease PMS, guard against heart disease, and even ward off cancer.Trouble is, most of us don't get enough vitamin D to maintain bone health, let alone reach the levels that protect against chronic disease. People used to get a lot of vitamin D from sunlight. Nowadays we protect ourselves from the sun, and our vitamin D levels have declined as a result. What's more, experts say the current daily recommendation of 400 IU is too low, and that most Americans need a minimum of 1,000 IU of vitamin D every day, especially in the absence of sunlight.Where to find it:It may be difficult to get all of the vitamin D you need by loading up on vitamin D-rich foods like salmon and fortified milk and cereal. To get the recommended 1,000 IU, look for supplements that contain vitamin D (cholecalciferol), an active form that's more effective than its vitamin D2 counterpart.FiberDietary fiber fills you up without weighing you down, helps keep blood sugar levels in check, and helps prevent health problems ranging from cancer to stroke. Even though the nutrient is widely available in fruits, vegetables, legumes, and whole grains, most Americans get very little. Our average intake is a paltry 14 grams per day, compared to the recommended 25 to 35 grams.""People are spending less money at the supermarket and more money at fast food joints that don't serve high-fiber meals,"" says Milton Stokes, research assistant at the University of Connecticut and founder of One Source Nutrition in Stamford. ""Not only does this increase the chance of constipation  an ailment that affects more than 4 million Americans  it also can lead to weight gain.""Where to find it:Fortunately, fiber is easy to find. Oatmeal, beans, barley, and most fruits and vegetables (especially apples, berries, and broccoli) are chock full of the stuff. If you're adding fiber to your diet, make sure to boost your water intake, too. A sudden increase in fiber consumption without water can cause bloating, constipation, and other tummy troubles.CalciumWhile the ""Got milk?"" campaign has done an excellent job of reminding us that calcium-rich foods promote strong bones, it fails to mention the many other roles calcium has. In fact, getting enough calcium can help prevent diseases ranging from diabetes and cancer to hypertension and heart disease.""Calcium is important for muscle function, not just bone health,"" says Christine Gerbstadt, national spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. ""The heart is a muscle and it needs calcium, too."" Only 21 percent of adults get the recommended amount of calcium (1,000 mg per day for women 19 to 50, and 1,200 mg for women 51 and over).Where to find it:According to Gerbstadt, two to three servings of dairy every day should meet your needs. Want extra insurance? Consider taking a supplement or choosing calcium-fortified cereals or orange juice."

Pregnant and underweight: How to get the nutrients you need,https://www.babycenter.com/0_pregnant-and-underweight-how-to-get-the-nutrients-you-need_1313894.bc,"How many pounds should I gain during pregnancy?Most women who start off their pregnancies underweight are advised to gain between 28 and 40 pounds  a bit more than the standard recommendation of 25 to 35 pounds. The March of Dimes suggests that if you begin your pregnancy underweight you try to gain slightly over a pound a week in the second and third trimesters (assuming you gain between 1 and 4 1/2 pounds in the first trimester).However, your doctor or midwife may make a different recommendation based on your individual situation, particularly if you have a history of eating disorders such as anorexia or bulimia.If you need help gaining the extra weight, seek out a registered dietitian. (Ask your healthcare provider for a recommendation.)Not sure if you were underweight before you were pregnant? View a body mass index (BMI) chart to find out. You're considered underweight if you have a BMI of less than 18.5. (Your BMI reflects the relationship between your height and weight.)Pregnancy weight gain trackerSee your target weight range for pregnancy and whether your weight gain is on track.Does being underweight pose any risks to my baby or me?If you're underweight at the start of your pregnancy, you have a greater risk of having a preterm birth or a small for gestational age (SGA) baby. This puts the baby at risk for a host of problems. However, gaining enough weight  and gaining consistently throughout your pregnancy  reduces this risk.How can I make sure I'm getting all the nutrients I need?To begin with, like all pregnant women, you need to be taking a folic acid supplement to reduce your baby's risk of a neural tube defect. In fact, experts recommend taking 400 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid per day, beginning at least a month before you start trying to get pregnant. Some experts advise raising the dose to at least 600 mcg per day once you're pregnant.Other than that, the bulk of your nourishment should come from whole foods, but a prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement can help make up for some shortcomings. Your doctor or midwife will probably recommend that you start taking one as soon as you find out you're pregnant, if not before.If you're not sure you can stick to a healthy diet on your own, a registered dietitian can help you come up with a sensible meal plan and even provide you with simple recipes that include the foods rich in the vitamins and minerals that are essential to a healthy baby.Use our handy pregnancy food diary to make sure you're getting enough calories and nutrients and drinking plenty of water every day. The diary is also useful for tracking your mood and hunger levels, so you can spot patterns you may need to change.How can I stay on track with weight gain?Choose plenty of nutritious foods that contain some healthy fat and adequate calories. Here are four easy ways to get more calories:Eat breakfast every day. Add some peanut butter or a slice of cheese to your morning toast for an extra protein boost.Add a couple of slices of avocado and a handful of nuts or seeds to your salads for extra protein and healthy fat.Eat two or three snacks between meals. Choose foods like yogurt (for protein and calcium), dried fruit (for vitamins, minerals, and fiber), or a fruit and yogurt smoothie (for protein, calcium, vitamins, and minerals).Replace soda with milk (for protein and calcium) or juices that are high in vitamin C or beta carotene, an antioxidant. Grapefruit juice, orange juice, and papaya nectar are rich in vitamin C. Apricot nectar and carrot juice have lots of beta carotene.Show sources Hide sources Kanadys WM. 2007.

The worst foods for babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-worst-foods-for-babies_10320507.bc,"Babies don't need many calories, but they do need lots of nutrients. Yet some foods commonly offered to babies are essentially junk food  high in calories, sugar, or salt, and low in nutrients.Because babies are so small, it's easy for them to fill up quickly on the empty calories in junk food, leaving no room for nutrient-rich healthy foods. This nutritional deficit can even hinder development, says doctor and Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics spokesperson Christine Gerbstadt.That's why it's important to know which foods are best for babies and which ones to avoid, including junk food and potential choking hazards. Here's our list of the worst food choices for babies.Hot dogs and other dangerous foodsHard, sticky, slippery, chunky, and round foods are unsafe for young children because they can easily choke on them. So don't give your baby hot dogs, sausages, large pieces of meat or cheese, whole grapes, popcorn, chunky raw vegetables, and whole nuts and seeds.And once you start serving your baby finger foods, be sure to cut food into pieces no larger than half an inch.SodaSome babies are served soft drinks daily as early as 9 months of age, according to a 2008 survey of infant and toddler feeding habits. The same survey found that by 24 months, more than 10 percent of toddlers were drinking soda every day.Whether regular or diet, soda provides absolutely no nutrients, and filling up on either type means babies eat and drink less of the nutritious food their bodies really need.

That figure goes up to more than 40 percent by 12 months of age, making french fries among the top vegetables consumed by toddlers  and marking the start of an unhealthy habit.It's a good idea to minimize all fast food because it's loaded with fat, sugar, salt, and calories but low in healthy nutrients. If you do need to grab a bite on the go, look for baby-friendly options. Many chains now offer healthier choices, including yogurt and applesauce.Processed foodsPeople define 'processed' in different ways, but in general, the more the food is modified from what was originally caught, raised, or grown  and the longer the list of ingredients  the more processed it is.""The more processed the food, the more nutritional value tends to go down, and the more the sugar, salt, and fat content goes up,"" says Kate Geagan, dietitian and author ofGo Green, Get Lean.Meals made specifically for babies can be healthy and appropriate. The best prepared baby foods have few ingredients and no added salt, sugar, or modified food starch.But ready-to-eat foods meant for older children and adults are definitely not good for babies. ""They often contain way too much sodium,"" says dietitian Eileen Behan, author ofThe Baby Food Bible.For example, instead of serving canned pasta entrees, it's better to boil some noodles and sprinkle some cheese on top. And instead of serving deli meats, which are often high in sodium and carry a risk of food poisoning, cut up small bits of roast chicken or hamburger.Gelatin dessertsMost varieties are nearly all sugar, artificial color, and artificial flavor with a small amount of gelatin to make it wiggly. Homemade gelatin made with fruit juice and sugar eliminates the artificial additives, but it's still essentially just fruit juice and sweetener.True, gelatin is easy to swallow, but so is Gerbstadt's suggestion for a healthy, baby-friendly dessert: a baked, mashed apple with a sprinkle of cinnamon. ""It's naturally sweet and has good fiber, vitamins, and a yummy, smooth texture,"" she says.Juice and fruit drinksSure, these beverages contain fruit, but that doesn't mean they're healthy. The fiber in fresh fruit is largely lost in the juicing process, and what's left is a whole lot of sugar. Juice can also cause diarrhea in some babies.""Juice is basically a waste of calories,"" says pediatrician Ari Brown, coauthor of Baby 411: Clear Answers and Smart Advice for Your Baby's First Year. Using juice to sweeten your baby's food isn't a good idea either: The sugars in juice can make food pass through the digestive tract more quickly, interfering with the body's ability to absorb nutrients.And don't be fooled by advertisers' claims that juice provides babies with necessary vitamin C. ""Babies can easily get their vitamin C from one small serving of fruit,"" says Brown.5 tips to develop healthy eating habits Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:05Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:05Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosIf your baby is younger than 6 months, don't give her any juice. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies younger than 6 months drink only breast milk or formula.If your baby is 6 months or older and you decide to give her juice, do it sparingly. The AAP recommends offering your baby no more than 4 to 6 ounces of 100 percent fruit juice a day. (Don't serve anything labeled fruit ""drink,"" ""cocktail,"" or ""beverage"" because these often contain only a tiny amount of juice and a lot of water, sweetener, and food coloring.)Babies 6 to 12 months old can have small amounts of water, but breast milk or formula should still be their main beverage.

Prenatal vitamins: Why they're so important,https://www.babycenter.com/0_prenatal-vitamins-why-theyre-so-important_287.bc,"Are prenatal vitamins really necessary?Yes. It's hard to get all the nutrients you and your baby need, even if you eat a wide variety of food, including meat, dairy products, fruits, vegetables, grains, and legumes.Most women can benefit from taking a prenatal vitamin and mineral supplement (preferably before trying to conceive). Think of it as an insurance policy to make sure you're getting the right amount of certain crucial nutrients during pregnancy.Taking a prenatal vitamin is even more important for women with dietary restrictions, health issues, or pregnancy complications. This includes women who:Are vegetarians or vegansAre lactose intolerant or have other food intolerancesSmoke or abuse other substancesHave certain blood disordersHave an eating disorderHave certain chronic diseasesHave had gastric bypass surgeryArehaving twins or higher multiplesWhat does your OB-GYN want you to know before getting pregnant?

See all videosWhat's in a prenatal supplement that I can't get from food?Two crucial nutrients  folic acid and iron  are almost always included in prenatal vitamins because most pregnant women don't get enough of them from food alone.Folic acidGetting enough of this B vitamin in the month before you conceive and very early in your pregnancy can reduce your baby's risk of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida and anencephaly, by up to 70 percent. Folic acid may also reduce the risk of other defects, such as cleft lip, cleft palate, and certain heart defects. Taking folic acid may even lower your risk ofpreeclampsia.Your body absorbs the synthetic version of folic acid better than the natural one found in food, so even if you eat a balanced diet, a supplement is strongly recommended.For more details, see our complete article onfolic acid in your pregnancy diet.IronMost moms-to-be don't get enough of this mineral from their diet to meet their body's increased need during pregnancy, and this can lead toiron-deficiency anemia. Preventing iron-deficiency anemia can cut your risk ofpreterm delivery, low birth weight, and infant mortality.For more details, see our complete article oniron in your pregnancy diet. Due Date CalculatorFind out your due date, and see how big your baby is right now.What nutrients do I need that may not be in a prenatal supplement?CalciumYour prenatal vitamin may containcalcium, but there's a chance it won't be enough. You need calcium to help your baby grow strong bones and teeth as well ashealthy nerves and muscles (including the heart).Most prenatal vitamins contain between 100 and 200 milligrams (mg) of calcium, but some don't contain any. That's because calcium is a particularly bulky mineral, and the pills are already big enough!To find out how much calcium you need and how to get it, see our complete article oncalcium in your pregnancy diet.Essential fatty acidsPrenatal vitamins don't contain anyessential fatty acids, such as the omega-3 fatty acids DHA and EPA, which are important for the development of your baby's brain, nerve, and eye tissue.Fish is a major source of DHA and EPA, but you have to be careful about not eating too much fish that's high in mercury while you're pregnant.Because omega-3s are so important for your baby, it's a good idea to talk with your healthcare practitioner about whether you need a supplement.Learn more:Dietary fats in your pregnancy dietEating fish during pregnancyTaking fish oil supplements during pregnancyVitamin DYour body needs this fat-soluble vitamin to help build your baby's bones and teeth. Vitamin D plays an important role in maintaining levels of calcium and phosphorus.If you're lacking vitamin D during pregnancy, your baby may be short on the vitamin at birth. This can put your child at risk for rickets (which can lead to fractures and deformity), abnormal bone growth, and delayed physical development. A deficiency of vitamin D has also been linked to a greater risk of developingpregnancy complications such as preeclampsiaand gestational diabetes, but more research is needed to confirm these links.To find out how much vitamin D you need and how to get it, see our complete article onvitamin D in your pregnancy diet.When should I start taking prenatal vitamins?Take a prenatal vitamin every day as soon as you realize you're pregnant.Because folic acid is so important in the earliest weeks of your pregnancy, ideally you would start taking prenatal vitamins before you conceive  that's why many doctors recommend them for women who might become pregnant.Taking prenatal vitamins for at least three months before you conceive also could lessen morning sickness once you're pregnant.And if you breastfeed your baby, your doctor might recommend you continue taking prenatal vitamins even after your baby is born.How do I choose a prenatal supplement that's right for me?Unfortunately, no standards have been set for what should be in vitamin and mineral supplements because the Food and Drug Administration doesn't regulate them. That means it's up to you and your healthcare practitioner to make sure you choose one that's safe and appropriate for you. (See our article onbuying supplementsfor more guidance.)At your first prenatal checkup or at a preconception visit, your practitioner will probably prescribe a daily vitamin or recommend an over-the-counter brand. A good supplement provides certain nutrients (such as folic acid and iron) that you may not be able to get enough of from your diet. But it also provides no more than the recommended amounts of other nutrients that can be harmful to your baby if you take too much  likevitamin A.Vitamin A derived from animal products can cause birth defects when taken in high doses. That's why the vitamin A in most prenatal vitamins is at least partly in the form of beta-carotene.Beta-carotene is a nutrient found in fruits and vegetables, and your body converts this type to vitamin A. Unlike vitamin A from animal products, beta-carotene is considered safe even in high doses.Note: Make sure you don't take any other vitamin or mineral supplements while you're taking a prenatal supplement unless your practitioner recommends it. What if I mistakenly take two prenatal vitamins on the same day?Don't worry. Taking twice the recommended amounts of these nutrients on just one day won't harm you or your baby. But taking a double dose more often can be harmful, so it's important not to do it regularly.If your practitioner says you need more of a certain nutrient than your prenatal vitamin provides, take the additional amount as a separate supplement.What if I have trouble swallowing the pills?Prenatal vitamin and mineral supplements tend to be pretty big. They can be hard to swallow, especially if you're dealing withnausea.If this is a problem for you, your practitioner may be able to recommend a smaller pill or one with a slick coating that makes it easier to get down. (Pills that don't contain calcium tend to be smaller, and you can get your calcium in other ways.)Chewable prenatal vitamins are also available. There's even a powdered pregnancy supplement that you mix with water. So if you don't like one version, keep trying different options until you find a prenatal supplement you can take.What if the vitamins upset my stomach?If you're taking a supplement with more than the recommended 30 mg of iron, it may upset your gastrointestinal tract. (Supplements that contain 30 mg or less probably won't cause you any problems.)To avoid queasiness, try taking your supplement at bedtime or with a meal to make it easier to tolerate.Taking a lot of iron can lead to constipation, which is already a problem for many pregnant women. It can also cause nausea or, more rarely, diarrhea.If iron upsets your stomach, talk to your healthcare practitioner about it. If you're not anemic, it may make sense for you to switch to a prenatal vitamin with less iron. Otherwise, try to ease constipation by:Drinking prune juiceEating two to three servings of fruit a dayTaking a psyllium fiber supplementShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2014.

What eating for two really means,https://www.babycenter.com/eating-for-two,"Can I really eat twice as much now that I'm pregnant?No. You may sometimes be tempted to eat twice as much, but that's not what the doctor ordered.Your body becomes more efficient during pregnancy and is able to absorb more of the nutrients you eat. So consuming twice as much doesn't double your chances of having a healthy baby  instead, it's likely to mean excessive weight gain for you, which can put you at risk for pregnancy complications.While guidelines vary, the Institute of Medicine says if you're a healthy weight, you need no additional calories in the first trimester, 340 extra calories a day in the second trimester, and about 450 extra calories a day in the third trimester. If you're overweight or underweight, you'll need more or less than this depending on your weight gain goal.It takes only a couple of glasses of low-fat milk and a handful of sunflower seeds or a tuna sandwich to add enough calories for that last trimester. (But you'll need to eat more if you're having more than one baby.)Pregnancy Safety QuestionsOur experts answer your most pressing questions about what is and isn't safe during pregnancy.How can I get all the nutrients I need without eating a lot more calories?Here are some tips for maximizing nutrition during pregnancy:Plan meals and snacks based on the requirements outlined in the USDA Choose My Plate site for pregnant woman or another reliable source, like the Harvard Healthy Eating Plate. Learn more about meal planning for pregnancy.To meet your daily needs for protein, calories, carbohydrates, healthy fats, and key vitamins and minerals during pregnancy, eat a variety of foods. Even within a category of foods (like vegetables), look for different colors, types, and textures, for example.Try to minimize ""extra"" foods that have calories but few nutrients  sugary beverages, fried foods, foods with extra fat and sugar. Instead, choose meals and snacks that pack the most nutrition per calorie. Adding a few nutrition-packed snacks  like yogurt, nuts, a hard-boiled egg, some fresh fruits or vegetables  to your daily intake is a great way to get the healthy calories your baby needs.Choose foods that are as close to their natural state as possible. Pick whole-grain bread or brown rice over refined white bread or white rice, and fresh fruits or frozen unsweetened fruit over canned fruits in sugar syrup, for example.Eat fats, oils, and sweets sparingly. And be sure to choose healthy fats. Can't overcome your cravings for junk food? Discover some healthy  and delicious  alternatives.How is the food I eat divided between my needs and my baby's?Doctors don't understand exactly how you and your growing baby divvy up nutrients. Sustenance for your child comes from your diet and from the nutrients already stored in your bones and tissues.In the past, a developing fetus was thought of as a ""perfect parasite,"" taking all the necessary nourishment from the mother, regardless of her diet. This myth maintained that if your diet was deficient in, say, vitamin C, it didn't matter as far as the baby was concerned, because he could simply siphon the nutrient from you.Experts now believe that it's the growing baby who suffers if the mother's diet is lacking. Inadequate nutrition during pregnancy is thought to have lifelong effects on a baby's health.In a nutshell: Your baby's health and growth are directly related to what you eat before and during your pregnancy.What you eat is important. And when you're tempted to overdo it, remember that you're eating for a baby, not another full-size adult. Choose quality over quantity!Show sources Hide sources IOM. 2009.

Should your kids eat fish: How they can avoid mercury and still get their omega-3s,https://www.babycenter.com/0_should-your-kids-eat-fish-how-they-can-avoid-mercury-and-sti_10319857.bc,"Should my child eat fish?Many parents struggle with this question. The answer is yes, but you'll want to choose their fish carefully.Studies show that fish provide an array of nutrients that are important for your child's development. Most experts agree that the key nutrients are two omega-3 fatty acids  DHA and EPA  that are difficult to find in other foods. Fish is also low in saturated fat and high in protein, vitamin D, and other nutrients.On the other hand, you've probably heard that fish contain contaminants such as mercury, which can harm a child's developing brain and nervous system.Most experts agree that children should eat some fish. In fact, the 2015 Dietary Guidelines for Americans recommend that children 2 to 8 years old eat 3 to 6 ounces of fish per week, and that children 9 years old and older eat 8 to 10 ounces per week. But it can be hard to figure out which fish are best.Here are some guidelines to help you limit your child's exposure to mercury while making sure she gets the nutrients she needs.How does mercury get into fish?Mercury is everywhere, even in the air we breathe.Some of the sources (such as volcanoes and forest fires) are natural. It's also released into the air by power plants, cement plants, and certain chemical and industrial manufacturers.And mercury has been used for decades in making thermometers, thermostats, fluorescent lights, and many other products. When these items end up in a landfill, the mercury may be released.When mercury settles into water, bacteria convert it into a form called methylmercury. Fish absorb methylmercury from the water they swim in and the organisms they eat. Methylmercury binds tightly to the proteins in fish muscle and remains there even after the fish is cooked.What could happen if my child eats fish that's high in mercury?The body easily absorbs methylmercury from fish.Studies show that exposure to even low doses of methylmercury can affect the brain and nervous system. Babies (including those in utero) and young children are most vulnerable to high levels of methylmercury because their brains and nervous systems are still developing.Why not just take fish off my child's menu?Fish is too good a nutritional choice  especially during early childhood. Studies have shown that getting enough omega-3s during infancy (either through breastfeeding or supplemented formula) has a positive effect on a child's vision and cognitive development.Which fish are best to eat?Good choices include salmon, trout, anchovies, herring, sardines, and shad.Purdue University publishes a handy wallet card that tells you where most commercial fish falls on the mercury contamination scale and how much of each it's okay to eat.Purdue also has free iPhone/iPod apps that can help you track your seafood consumption and estimate your intake of omega-3s, mercury, and PCBs, a group of industrial pollutants that can harm your baby's nervous system.Which fish should I avoid altogether?The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the EPA advise women of childbearing age and young children not to eat four high-mercury species: swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico.Other experts and advocacy groups would like to expand this list. Purdue University toxicologist Charles Santerre recommends that you also avoid eating all fresh or frozen tuna, striped bass, bluefish, Chilean sea bass, golden snapper, marlin, orange roughy, amberjack, Crevalle jack, Spanish mackerel from the Gulf of Mexico, and walleye from the Great Lakes.He also recommends not eating striped bass and bluefish, which can be high in mercury and PCBs.What about canned tuna?There's some disagreement when it comes to canned tuna.The FDA recommends that children eat no more than two servings a week of canned ""chunk light"" tuna and no more than one serving a week of canned ""solid white"" or albacore tuna. That's because albacore tuna comes from large fish that tend to contain more mercury.Other experts, like Edward Groth, an independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, recommend that you avoid serving canned tuna entirely. Groth points out that canned tuna is by far the largest source of methylmercury in the American diet.What about fish caught in local waters?Check advisories from your state or local health and environmental agencies to figure out which fish to avoid and how much of each type it's safe to eat.These advisories are usually indicated on signposts in fishing areas. You can also access your state's advisories on this map, which is kept up-to-date by Purdue University.If you don't find an advisory for local fish, the EPA recommends limiting your child to one serving per week and not serving her any other fish that week.What can my child eat, other than fish, to get omega-3s?It's not easy to find DHA and EPA in other foods.Many foods  such as eggs, milk, soy beverages, juice, yogurt, bread, and cereal  are now fortified with omega-3s, but most of these contain only ALA. ALA is an omega-3 that provides some health benefits, but not the same ones you get from DHA and EPA. (Most food labels don't specify the type of omega-3.)You may have heard that flaxseed is a good source of omega 3s, but it does not provide DHA or EPA. The only omega-3 fatty acid in plant foods is ALA.What about omega-3 supplements?""In general, it's better to get specific nutrients from food than supplements,"" says Keli Hawthorne, a registered dietitian in the pediatrics department at the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at Austin. That way your child will benefit from other nutrients in the foods at the same time. Also, we don't have conclusive evidence that these supplements provide the same significant benefits as eating fish.Still, if you find that your child isn't eating enough foods that contain omega-3s, you might want to talk with her healthcare provider about giving her a supplement.Omega-3 supplements provide EPA and DHA and are mercury-free. Many contain fish oil, but mercury is not stored in fatty tissue, so it's not in the oil, although PCBs may be.These supplements come in liquid, soft chews, and soft gel form, and some are flavored to mask the fishy taste. If you give your child a flavored variety, be sure to store the container out of reach (so she doesn't eat them like candy).How much omega-3s should my child get each day?The Food and Nutrition Board (the group that sets the recommended daily intake levels for nutrients) has not set recommended levels for DHA or EPA.Your child's healthcare provider can recommend specific amounts (based on your child's diet and any other supplements she may be taking) and perhaps brands.How can I find out how much mercury my child has in her body?It's simple to test for mercury in your child's blood or in a hair sample, but testing is not routinely recommended. Following the guidelines above for amounts and types of fish to eat should help keep your child's mercury levels in a safe range.If your child eats fish more often than recommended and you're concerned, talk with your healthcare provider about having a test done. If your child's levels indicate that she's getting too much mercury, your provider or a dietitian can help you change her diet accordingly.This article was reviewed by:Edward Groth, Ph.D., independent food safety and environmental health consultant and former senior scientist at Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports magazineKeli Hawthorne, M.S., R.D., L.D., director for clinical research for the Department of Pediatrics at the Dell Medical School at The University of Texas at AustinCharles R.

Healthy food swaps,https://www.babycenter.com/0_healthy-food-swaps_10381493.bc,"You know your family should be eating more vegetables, fruits, whole grains, and legumes  they're nutrient-rich, heart-healthy, planet-friendly foods.But it's not always easy, especially when you're feeding picky eaters. Try these stealthy switch-ups and fun presentations to deliver more nutrition without alerting the finicky folks in your family grown-ups too!Blend in veggiesUsing a hand blender or food processor, puree a mix of vegetables and stir it into tomato-based dishes like pasta sauce or chili. This is an easy way to add vitamins, nutrients, and fiber while avoiding recognizable chunks of vegetables your child might otherwise reject. You can use this trick with soups and casseroles too.Choose whole grain tortillasA lot of people don't like whole-grain bread and pasta if they're used to white-flour versions. It can take time for your palate to adjust, like changing from whole milk to low-fat or skim. But whole grains have a delicious, nutty flavor that you may come to prefer  and so might your child, given enough exposure.Tortillas can be a good place to start. Burritos, enchiladas, or tacos  especially when smothered in a zesty tomato sauce  are a great way to sneak in some whole grains. Thanks to bold flavors, your child probably won't notice that healthy wrapper.Pick fruit instead of fruit juiceKids love fruit juices, but most drink too much. It's better to eat whole fruit, which has more fiber and fewer calories. If you do give your child juice, make sure it's 100 percent juice to avoid added sugar, and try diluting it so it's at least half water.Also, keep in mind the American Academy of Pediatrics' advice when it comes to juice: No juice for babies younger than 6 months, limit daily servings of juice to 4 to 6 ounces for children 6 and younger, and no more than 8 to 12 ounces for kids 7 and older.Vary your proteins with tofuIt's smart to consume a variety of proteins, and tofu is a great source that doesn't call attention to itself when mixed with other ingredients. Try adding chopped tofu to a bean-and-corn burrito, for example. (""This chicken is delicious!"" said one of my unwitting friends when served refried-bean-and-tofu enchiladas one evening.)Tofu also works great chopped up and scrambled like eggs in a breakfast burrito or mixed in with sliced vegetables for a quick stir-fry. Use silken tofu in fruit smoothies for a healthy treat.Make things tastier with nut buttersNuts are nutrient powerhouses, rich in heart-healthy fats, vitamins, and minerals. The tried-and-true trick of slathering peanut butter onto celery sticks or apples is a winner (as long as your child doesn't have a nut allergy, of course).Adding raisins or dried cranberries is a yummy way to increase fruit consumption  though you'll want to watch the portions, as dried fruits and nut butters are energy dense. Peanut butter is classic, but there are lots of other nut butters to try. Diversity is key to a healthy diet.Add veggies to tuna saladAdding finely diced carrots, celery, onions, peppers, and even radishes to tuna sandwiches is a good way to tuck in extra veggies. It might take some trial and error to see what your child will accept, but you'll probably be able to include at least a few of these vegetables with success.How about adding a drizzle of olive oil too? He won't taste it next to the mayo, but olive oil will add valuable phytonutrients and monounsaturated fat for a heart-healthier sandwich filling.Try whole grain pastaSame approach here as with tortillas  the whole-grain version is healthier and can be easier to introduce when served with a hearty sauce. Start with a little whole-grain pasta mixed in with your regular brand to help your child adjust to the taste, and in a couple of months you can make the full swap. You can try the same thing when switching from white to brown rice.Substitute white whole-wheat flourWhite whole-wheat flour is one of the best things to hit the market in recent years. It doesn't work for all baked goods, but you can use it in many items (or use half white flour and half white whole-wheat flour) and no one will be able to tell. You can make healthier chocolate chip cookies and brownies, but these are still once-in-a-while treats, not health foods.Learn more:Find ideas for quick and healthy snacksSeven strategies for feeding a picky eaterCooking with kidsP.

Choosing to formula-feed,https://www.babycenter.com/0_choosing-to-formula-feed_471.bc,"I want to formula-feed my baby, but everybody says it's better to breastfeed. Is this true?Both formula feeding and breastfeeding are valid, healthy choices for your baby. The decision to do one or the other  or a combination of both  is purely personal and depends on what's right for your family and circumstances.Breast milk gives your baby the best possible nutrition, protects against infection, and even adjusts to meet your infant's nutritional needs (something formula can't do). You benefit too: Breastfeeding helps you bond with your baby, and research suggests it may even lower your risk of ovarian and breast cancers.If possible, you may want to try nursing, at least for the first month, so your natural immunities can be passed to your child.Or, consider a combination of breastfeeding and formula feeding. If you're nursing, it's okay to give your baby formula once a day as long as your breast milk supply is well established, which usually happens within a month of giving birth. Some women supplement this way because formula feeding gives them a break (especially in the middle of the night) and lets their partner help feed the baby.That said, exclusive formula feeding  either right from the start or after a period of nursing  is also a healthy way to feed your baby. Formula even has some vitamins and other nutrients that breastfed babies have to get from supplements, like vitamin D.If you're concerned about your choice, try to separate the medical facts from the political and cultural rhetoric. Your child's doctor will work with you to make sure your baby is getting all the nutrients she needs and chart her growth to make sure she's growing well. In the end, the most important thing you can do for your baby is love and nurture her  and that includes feeding her whichever way you choose.There are plenty of reasons women choose to formula-feed. Among them are having a baby with a poor sucking reflex (common in premature babies), prolonged mother-infant separation, painful nursing, the fear that your baby isn't getting enough milk, the need to return to work, a health problem that requires medication that's not safe for a nursing infant, and a desire to let other family members help feed the baby.Which type of formula should I use?Most formulas are made from cow's milk or soybeans. There are also specialized formulas for babies who are allergic to milk or soy proteins, and for babies who are premature or have a low birth weight. Any formula you choose should be iron-fortified to prevent anemia. To find out more about choosing the right formula for your baby, see our article and talk to your baby's doctor.Why can't I just feed my baby cow's milk?Never feed your infant cow's milk. It's just not recommended until after your baby's first birthday because it doesn't have the proper nutrients in the right proportions for a growing infant. It can also cause digestive trouble.Find out more about when to transition your child to regular cow's milk and how to make the switch.What are follow-up formulas, and should I switch to one?Follow-up formulas are specifically designed for babies 4 to 12 months old who are already eating some solids. Follow-up formulas contain more calcium, iron, protein, and calories than infant formulas.Most babies don't need follow-up formula. Doctors encourage parents to introduce solid food (baby cereal, pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables) to their babies at 4 to 6 months, rather than fill them up with formula.Still, it depends on the individual child. Babies with food allergies, those who are very sensitive to different foods, and those with a history of poor growth may benefit from follow-up formula. Talk to your doctor about what's best for your baby.I'd like to supplement breast milk with formula. How should I do it?Lactation consultants suggest waiting to introduce a bottle until the baby is 4 weeks old. By then, breastfeeding is usually well established, but your baby's not yet likely to resist a new kind of nipple. (Nursing and taking a bottle require different types of sucking.)It's best to have someone else give the first bottle because your baby can smell you and your milk and may refuse to take a bottle if you're nearby.If you plan to use formula for occasional feedings, don't offer more than one bottle every 24 hours. Otherwise, your milk production could slow down. If you're returning to work soon and plan to have your caregiver give your baby formula while you're away and nurse when you're home, ease into it by replacing one feeding with a bottle every three to four days.Get more tips on supplementing with formula.Show sources Hide sources AAP.

Zinc in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_zinc-in-your-childs-diet_10324698.bc,"Zinc is crucial for good health and development. Read on to find out how much zinc your child needs, the best sources, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Find out more: Nine other important nutrients for childrenWhy zinc is importantMore than 70 enzymes depend on zinc to perform their roles in digestion and metabolism. And children who don't get enough zinc risk having stunted growth. Fortunately, zinc deficiencies are rare in the United States.How much zinc does your child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 3 milligrams (mg) per dayAges 4 to 8 years: 5 mg per dayYour child doesn't have to get the recommended daily amount of zinc every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Good sources of zincZinc can be found in a wide variety of foods. Here are some of the best sources of zinc:1/4 cup baked beans with pork and tomato sauce: 3.3 mg1 ounce cooked beef shank: 3 mg1/2 medium broiled hamburger (1.5 ounces), 95% lean: 2.7 mg1 ounce broiled steak: 2.6 mg1/2 cup ready-to-eat breakfast cereal, fortified with 25% of DV for zinc: 2.5 mg1 ounce dry roasted almonds: 1 mg1/2 cup low-fat fruit yogurt: 0.8 mg1 tablespoon cashew butter, no salt added: 0.8 mg1 packet instant oatmeal: 0.8 mg1/4 cup part-skim ricotta cheese: 0.8 mg1/4 cup canned baked beans: 0.8 mg1/4 roasted chicken leg: 0.6 mg1/4 cup garbanzo beans: 0.6 mg1/4 cup lentils: 0.6 mg1/2 ounce Swiss cheese: 0.5 mg1 tablespoon almond butter: 0.5 mg1/4 cup raw tofu, prepared with calcium sulfate: 0.5 mg(Note: Tofu varies in nutrients, depending on how it's processed. Check the nutrient label.)1/4 cup cooked peas: 0.4 mg1/4 cup lima beans: 0.4 mg1/4 skinless chicken breast: 0.4 mg1/2 ounce mozzarella or cheddar cheese: 0.4 mg1/2 cup milk: 0.4 mg1 teaspoon wheat germ: 0.3 mgThe amount of zinc a food contains will vary somewhat, depending on the brand or the cut of meat, for instance. Note that for very young children, nut butters should be thinly spread and other foods (like beans and meats) should be mashed or cut into small pieces to avoid choking.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts of food shown, depending on their age and appetite. You can estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can your child get too much zinc?It's not likely your child will get too much zinc from diet alone, but excessive amounts (from vitamin supplements, for example) can cause adverse effects, like nausea and vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, and headaches. Too much zinc over the long run can cause long-term toxic effects, as well.The maximum amount considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine for children 1 to 3 years old is 7 mg. For children 4 to 8 years, it's 12 mg. (This is called the tolerable upper intake level or UL.)"
10 energy-boosting foods,https://www.babycenter.com/0_10-energy-boosting-foods_10352389.bc,"When your energy is low, it's tempting to give in to cravings for caffeine and sugar  anything to help get you through the day. Instead, choose foods that are rich in protein or fiber to give your body the fuel it needs to keep going. Here are ten of our favorites.EggsAt just 78 calories and 6 grams of protein, the egg is a protein powerhouse. And it's loaded with other nutrients as well, especially in the yolks, says Jonny Bowden, author of The 150 Most Effective Ways to Boost Your Energy. ""People avoid the yolk because they're worried about cholesterol, but egg yolks contain choline, which is critical for memory.""OatmealLoaded with stress-reducing B vitamins and soluble fiber, oatmeal is the perfect choice for an energy boost. Dietary fiber fills you up without weighing you down, keeps blood sugar levels in check, and helps prevent the overwhelming desire to snooze come 3 p.m. Add a few nutrient-rich berries on top, and you've got the snack of champions.Apples""Not only are fiber-rich apples an excellent choice for a mid-afternoon snack, they're also disease-fighting powerhouses,"" says Pamela Nisevich, sports nutrition consultant at Swim, Bike, Run, Eat! What's more, apples contain boron, a mineral that helps keep you alert.PumpkinPumpkin is loaded with potassium, which helps your heart and muscles function better, says Bowden. Plus, it's packed with fiber (which helps stabilize blood sugar levels) and vitamin A (which helps keep your immune system strong enough to fight off energy-draining infections). Add canned pumpkin to rice for a quick, healthy risotto.SalmonHow many other foods help protect your heart, boost brainpower, and make you feel happy to boot? Salmon is packed with vitamins, minerals, and omega-3 essential fatty acids which research suggests can boost your mood. Plus, its lower in fat and calories than most other protein sources.PeanutsWhile peanuts are high in calories, they're also more filling than other foods, and they naturally curb your calorie intake throughout the day. A study published in the International Journal of Obesity found that when people consumed 500 calories of peanuts daily for 19 weeks, their resting metabolic rate increased by 11 percent  even without added exercise.Trail Mix""Trail mix is quite possibly the world's perfect energy booster,"" says Nisevich. ""It's packed with enough carbs and protein to get you up the trail or over the mountain."" To avoid added sugar and fat, make your own mix with nutrient-rich dried cranberries or apricots and heart-healthy nuts like pistachios and almonds.LentilsThese quick-cooking legumes are a great source of soluble fiber, which gives you steady, slow-burning energy while stabilizing your blood sugar. That fiber  along with folate and magnesium  also helps protect your heart. Finally, lentils are a healthy source of iron, a nutrient you need more of when you're pregnant or lactating. Serve them with whole grains for a complete protein  meaning it contains all nine essential amino acids.YogurtYogurt boasts higher concentrations of protein, calcium, and vitamin D than milk. Plus many brands of yogurt have live active cultures, which can aid digestion. Try organic or Greek yogurt since it's less likely to be loaded with artificial ingredients, sugar, and preservatives.HummusThis yummy spread is made from chickpeas, sesame seeds, lemon, and olive oil. It's a great source of protein and fiber, as well as iron, vitamin C, and folate. Use it as a dip for carrots, peppers, and whole wheat pita strips."
Lactose intolerance,https://www.babycenter.com/0_lactose-intolerance_1201464.bc,"What is lactose intolerance?When you're lactose intolerant, it means your body can't produce enough lactase, the enzyme needed to digest lactose, the primary sugar in cow's milk and other dairy products. As a result, the undigested lactose stays in the intestine and causes gastrointestinal problems. These problems tend to be uncomfortable but not dangerous.Babies who are born prematurely sometimes can't produce adequate amounts of lactase for a while. A baby's level normally increases during the end of the last trimester of pregnancy.True lactose intolerance usually shows up in the grade-school or teen years. While it's possible for symptoms to appear earlier, it's very unlikely that your baby is lactose intolerant.What causes lactose intolerance?We don't know why some people are lactose intolerant and others aren't, but it's not rare. Between 30 and 50 million people in the United States are lactose intolerant.Genetics play a role: About 90 percent of Asian Americans  and as many as 75 percent of African American, Hispanic American, Jewish, and Native American adults  are lactose intolerant. About 15 percent of people of northern European descent have the condition.Very rarely, a baby is born with lactose intolerance. (Both parents would have to pass the gene for this type of lactose intolerance to the baby.) From birth, the baby would have severe diarrhea and be unable to tolerate the lactose in his mother's breast milk or in formula made from cow's milk. He'd need a special, lactose-free infant formula.If your baby has had a severe case of diarrhea, his body may temporarily have trouble producing lactase, and he may have symptoms of lactose intolerance for a week or two.Some medications can also cause the body to produce lower levels of lactase, causing temporary lactose intolerance. People with long-term conditions that affect the intestines (like celiac disease or Crohn's disease) sometimes suffer from lactose intolerance as well.What are the symptoms of lactose intolerance?If your baby is lactose intolerant, he may have diarrhea, abdominal cramping, bloating, or gas about 30 minutes to two hours after drinking breast milk or eating dairy products, like cheese or yogurt, once he starts eating solids. (Babies should not drink cow's milk until their first birthday.)Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.Some lactose-intolerant people can consume a small amount of dairy without symptoms. Others will be uncomfortable every time they have food containing even a small amount of lactose.Is lactose intolerance the same as a milk allergy?No. An allergy is an immune response, while lactose intolerance is a digestive condition. The symptoms can be similar, however. Abdominal pain or diarrhea after consuming milk products could be caused by a milk allergy or by lactose intolerance, for example.If your baby develops a dry, itchy rash or itching and swelling of the face, lips, or mouth whenever he has dairy products  or symptoms such as hives, watery eyes, or a runny nose  he may be allergic to one of the proteins in cow's milk.How will I know for sure if my baby is lactose intolerant?Again, it's very unlikely that your baby is showing signs of lactose intolerance at this age, but talk with his doctor. She'll ask about your baby's symptoms to help determine whether it's a possibility. She may suggest that you eliminate all sources of lactose from your baby's diet for a couple of weeks to see whether his symptoms subside.Can lactose intolerance be treated or prevented?No, but there are things you can do to help your baby if he's lactose intolerant.Read labels. You'll want to avoid dairy products and all other foods that contain lactose. Some seemingly innocuous foods contain milk products: pancake and cookie mixes, breakfast cereals, instant potatoes and soups, margarine, salad dressings, breads, and lunch meats. Check food labels for ingredients such as whey, curds, milk byproducts, dry milk solids, and nonfat dry milk powder.Thanks to recent legislation, products containing milk ingredients (or other common allergens) must be clearly labeled as such. This should make your task much easier.Watch how your baby reacts. Some people who are lactose intolerant can digest small amounts of lactose, while others are very sensitive to the tiniest quantities. You'll probably learn through trial and error how much of which dairy foods your baby can handle.Some cheeses have less lactose than others, for example, so they may be easier to digest. And live-culture yogurt is generally easier to digest than milk and other dairy products because the healthy bacteria in it helps produce lactase.If your baby is very sensitive, you'll want to avoid all sources of lactose. If not, you may be able to give him small amounts of selected dairy foods. He may find it easier to tolerate dairy products if he eats them along with other foods.Make sure all of your baby's nutritional needs are being met. If you find that you need to eliminate dairy products from your baby's diet as he grows, you'll want to be sure that he has other sources of calcium, which helps bones and teeth grow strong. Nondairy sources of calcium include leafy greens, fortified juices and soy milk, tofu, broccoli, canned salmon, oranges, and fortified breads.Other nutrients to be concerned about are vitamins A and D, riboflavin, and phosphorus. See our article on food sources of various nutrients for suggestions on how your child can get the nutrients he needs from nondairy sources. You might also find it helpful to consult a dietitian.Lactose-free dairy products are now available in many grocery stores. They have all the nutrients of regular dairy products without the lactose.And finally, if you find that it's difficult to get your baby all the nutrition he needs without dairy products, talk with his doctor about whether your baby might benefit from taking supplements.Show sources Hide sources AAP.

Feeding problems: Refusing to eat,https://www.babycenter.com/0_feeding-problems-refusing-to-eat_9203.bc,"The problemOne of the first skills your toddler masters is feeding herself. Though she can't control much in her life right now, she can definitely control what she puts in her mouth.So it's no surprise when she's very opinionated about what she will  and won't  eat. She may eat only one or two preferred foods for weeks, then suddenly change her mind and want something completely different. Don't worry  this is typical toddler behavior.What you can doYour child needs some encouragement and structure from you when it comes to mealtimes (such as regular meals and healthy choices), but not much more. William Sears, noted pediatrician and author of 23 books on childcare, says whether and how much your child eats should ultimately be up to her. ""Your child may eat well one day and eat practically nothing the next,"" says Dr. Sears, who co-authored The Family Nutrition Book with his wife, Martha.Rather than get hung up on the fact that your child has refused everything you put in front of her today, consider what she's eaten over the course of one week. Parents are often surprised to find that their child's food intake balances out. Something must be fueling all that energy!Rest assured: As long as your child is growing and gaining weight accordingly, you can be confident that your toddler is getting enough to eat. If you're concerned, ask your child's doctor to go over your child's growth chart. You may be relieved to find out you dont have anything to worry about!Here are a few tips to help get through those bumpy patches:Offer a variety of healthy food choices and let your toddler feed herself. This way she gets to exercise a little independence.Don't threaten her or bargain with her. ""One more bite and you get a cookie,"" or, ""No story time if you don't eat your peas,"" makes mealtime into a power struggle. If you want to raise a healthy eater, keep mealtimes positive, and don't use sweets as a reward.Have meals as a family whenever possible. When your toddler sees you or her siblings eating healthy food, she's more likely to want to follow along.Don't take something off the menu if she doesn't like it. Kids are slow to accept new tastes and textures, so if she spits out green beans the first time, try making them again the following week. She may surprise you and decide they're her new favorite food. (Though you may have to offer a new food many times before she's willing to make it a regular part of her diet.)Don't forget to consider how much she drinks in the food equation, too. Drinking too much milk or juice can dampen an appetite, so you may want to serve milk between meals and limit juice to no more than 1/2 to 3/4 cup a day. Don't offer juice to infants younger than 1. Milk and 100 percent juice can supply vital nutrients (though too much juice means too much sugar, and fruit juice lacks the fiber and some nutrients found in fruit).And don't let her fill up on sweets and junk food  her growing body needs the nutrients supplied by a healthy diet, not empty calories.Extra vitaminsThe American Academy of Pediatrics says that a daily multivitamin isn't usually necessary if your toddler eats a variety of food. But if she doesn't eat much meat or fish, iron-fortified cereal, or iron-rich dark green vegetables, she may need an iron supplement. The best way to know whether your child needs a daily multivitamin  and what kind to give her  is to check with her doctor.And whether or not your doctor recommends a multivitamin, your child will still need some extra vitamin D. Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium and phosphorus, which build bones. Sunscreen prevents sunlight from synthesizing vitamin D, and it's difficult to get this essential nutrient from milk alone, so doctors recommend giving children 400 international units (IUs) of vitamin D daily.Most multivitamins contain vitamin D. If your doctor recommends a multivitamin, your child will usually not need an extra vitamin D supplement.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2013a. Dietary supplements for toddlers.

10 ways to make your pregnancy pounds pay off,https://www.babycenter.com/0_10-ways-to-make-your-pregnancy-pounds-pay-off_10396238.bc,"Pregnancy gives you a very important reason to gain weight: To nourish a baby and keep yourself healthy, you'll need additional calories, nutrients, vitamins, and minerals.(You can find out how much food you need every day in our article on meal planning during pregnancy.)But what's the healthiest way to do that, while maximizing nutrition and avoiding the bad stuff?1. Dont cut out fatsThe key is to choose nutritious ones. After all, the fat in a doughnut and the fat in an avocado are not created equal. As much as you can, pick healthy fats; the avocado's monounsaturated fats are a lot better than the saturated or trans fats found in a doughnut or pastryand it has vitamins C and K, as well.Eating healthy fats will have a positive impact that lasts beyond pregnancy, says Bridget Swinney, a registered dietitian in Texas and author ofEating Expectantly: Practical Advice for Healthy Eating Before, During, and After Pregnancy.""Your body will store some of the fat you eat to use in your breast milk. For the healthiest breast milk, limit saturated and trans fats now and while you're breastfeeding,"" Swinney says. Find out more about healthy fats pregnant women need and where to get them.2. Choose foods that pack a nutritional punchEat foods that give you more for every bite, like yogurt, which contains calcium, potassium, and protein, and is also a powerful source of probioticsthe good bacteria that helps keep digestion healthy.Other great picks are berries like blueberries, strawberries, raspberries, and cranberries. These are rich in vitamin C and fiber, but they're also packed with antioxidants, which help fight inflammation.Mushrooms are another nutritional star, says Swinney.""Mushrooms are a good source of minerals like selenium and copper, and they're also the only natural vegetarian source of vitamin D,"" Swinney says. ""Some contain the daily value in one serving.""Find out more about the best foods for pregnant women.3. Eat the whole spectrumTo make sure you're getting a broad range of nutrients, try to load up on colorful fruits and vegetables as often as possible.Try dark green kale, ruby red strawberries, and orange squash. Swinney encourages pregnant women to aim for three cups of vegetables and two cups of fruit each day.In fact, fruits and veggies should fill half your plate at every meal, according to new guidelines from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).(Want more info? The USDA offers a customized eating plan for moms-to-be that corresponds to your stage of pregnancy.)And while it's often true that the deeper the color, the more nutritious the veggie, that's not always the case. Vegetables such as cauliflower and cabbage are full of nutrients.So are white potatoes, which often get a bad rap. A medium potato has only 110 calories and provides more than a third of the daily vitamin C needed during pregnancy, plus 2 grams of fiber. (Sweet potatoes are extremely rich in beta carotene but boast less vitamin C.) All the more reason to bake one up, add toppings, and call it lunch or dinner.The dietary danger lurks in the serving size and the preparation: its news to no one that French fries  whether they're made from sweet or white potatoes  are high in fat and saltnot too mention temptingly easy to overindulge in.Nutty brown also counts; try whole wheat breads or pasta to maximize your nutrients. If youre already used to brown rice and whole-grain oatmeal, consider trying some new grains like bulgur and millet.4. Pair foods to maximize their goodnessSome foods are even better together. No, we're not talking about peanut butter and jelly (though that can be a tasty, healthy snack), but rather about foods that enhance each other's nutritional benefits.For example, foods rich in vitamin C  like citrus fruit, melon, berries, broccoli, cabbage, and tomatoes help your body absorb the iron from beans, grains, and eggs. So spoon salsa on your scrambled eggs or black bean tacos, or serve them with a side of melon or steamed broccoli.Or try pairing a prebiotic food with a probiotic food to boost the effects of both. Prebiotics (such as bananas, artichokes, asparagus, onions, and whole grains) encourage the growth of healthy bacteria in your gut, while probiotics like yogurt, kefir, aged cheese, sauerkraut, miso, and tempeh contain gut-healthy bacteria alreadyso one supports the other. Some winning combinations: yogurt with banana, artichoke hearts drizzled with a Greek yogurt sauce, or diced asparagus in miso soup.5. Cook from scratch when you canBy making meals at home, you can control the ingredients, and you'll wind up with better quality, often for less money. For example, many store-bought salad dressings use less expensive  and less healthy  oils than those you'd use at home.One idea: Make your own olive oil-based salad dressing to pour over a spinach or kale salad, then add avocado. Olive oil and avocado help your body absorb more lutein, which is important for eye and brain health, and beta carotene, important for the immune system.Many people are intimidated by cooking fish, but it can be a snap. Cover a slab of salmon with some pesto sauce or olive oil, salt, and pepper, and cook in the microwave for about 3 to 5 minutes or the oven for 12 to 15 minutes at 450 degrees. Salmon has omega-3 fats that help build your baby's brain and eyes.You can also make sweets like quick breads or cookies at home using healthier fats (canola oil or mashed avocado) and less sugar. (You can usually cut the sugar in a recipe by a third without noticing.) Try replacing some of the oil with high-fiber foods like black beans or prunes. And sneak in some extra nutrients by adding dried fruits and nuts.6. Rethink your drinksIt's important to stay hydrated during pregnancy, but how you do it can make a big difference. Steer clear of soda, sweet tea, and sugary fruit drinks and juices  they're full of empty calories. Water, milk, or vegetable juice are better choices.Drinking one-hundred100 percent juice (without added sweeteners) can be a great way to get one serving of fruit. Juice has a lot of natural sugars and calories, though, so limit your intake to one cup a day.Pick juices with powerful nutrients. Cranberry juice may help prevent urinary tract infections; apple juice contains phytochemicals linked to improved respiratory health; and orange juice is rich in vitamin C, potassium, and folic acid, which are important for your babys development.If plain water doesn't appeal, try a spritzer: Pour sparkling water into a glass and add a splash of fruit juice or pureed fruit (watermelon and mint tastes great).7. Embrace eggsThey're cheap, easy to prepare, and great for your baby. A large egg is roughly 80 calories, over half of which comes from the yolk. Speaking of which, if you've been an egg-white omelet aficionada until now, pregnancy is a time to rethink that. Both the egg yolk and the white contain healthy lean protein.And yolks are packed with vitamins such as choline, which is important for your baby's developing brain  and may help your memory, too.""When I was pregnant, I added a hard-boiled egg a day as a snack,"" says Jessica Corwin, a registered dietitian and community nutrition educator for Spectrum Health in Michigan. ""Eggs might contain a little cholesterol, but they're full of nutrients and an easy, affordable way to get choline into your diet.""8. Break out the beansPacked with protein and dirt cheap, beans can be a meal unto themselves. To make a big pot, soak dried beans overnight in water; drain the next day; add water to cover; and toss in garlic, onion, and spices; then cook until tender. Add them to a salad, combine them with rice, or team with a portion of meat for a well-balanced meal.""Beans have protein, fiber, carbs, and no fat unless it's added,"" says Eleana Kaidanian, a New York registered dietitian who counsels pregnant women. ""They have great iron content and they're really filling.""Legumes include beans, peas, and lentils, and there are so many varieties, you can't get tired of them,"" says Kaidanian.9. Choose treats that add valueBreak out the dark chocolate. Though it does contain sugar and fat, it shouldn't be on your ""unhealthy"" list, says nutritionist Bridget Swinney. ""Chocolate, especially dark chocolate, contains antioxidants that may actually help blood pressure,"" she says.Still, Swinney advises sticking to small amounts. She recommends 1 to 2 tablespoons of cocoa or half an ounce of dark chocolate a day. (That's about what you'd get in a cup of hot cocoa, three dark Hershey Kisses, or one and a half Dove Promises.)Another healthy splurge: dark chocolate-covered almonds. Just 11 contain 25 percent of your vitamin E for the day.Or go for frozen yogurt or low-fat ice cream, which contains protein and calcium. Punch up the nutrition by topping it with sliced banana and slivered almonds.10. Snack smartSnacking and pregnancy are a good fit: Having smaller, more-frequent meals or snacks can help ward off morning sickness, indigestion, and heartburn. And healthy snacking provides a steady stream of nutrients to your developing baby.But don't let regular snacking morph into all-day eating. Brush up on how much extra you need to be eating, which may be a lot less than you think.""To stick to a well-balanced weight, pregnant women don't have to eat much more,"" says Ashley Roman, director of the NYU Maternal Fetal Care Center.You can often get the extra calories you need in one healthy snack  yogurt with fruit, cheese and crackers, apples and peanut butter. ""Not a hot fudge sundae,"" Roman says.Bonnie Rochman is a health writer who is at work on a book about how genetics is reshaping childhood."

Seven facts about pregnancy after weight-loss surgery,https://www.babycenter.com/0_seven-facts-about-pregnancy-after-weight-loss-surgery_1504874.bc,"Weight-loss surgery (also called bariatric or gastric bypass surgery) is becoming ever more common  according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the number of people getting gastric bypass surgery increased ninefold from 1996 to 2004. But how do these kinds of surgeries affect getting pregnant and pregnancy itself? Here are seven facts you should know about it.1. You may get a boost in fertilityBariatric surgery can produce a sudden positive change in your fertility. A report in a November 2005 issue of the Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing found that women with fertility problems linked to obesity who have the surgery can start ovulating regularly for the first time in years.And if you have polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), your fertility should also get a boost after surgery. A study published in the December 2005 issue of the Journal of Clinical Endocrinology and Metabolism found that post-surgery weight loss for women with PCOS resolved their metabolic and reproductive abnormalities.Important caveat: This newfound fertility can raise your chances of getting pregnant by accident if you haven't been using birth control  a problem if you're in the initial 18-month post-surgery period (see below). Read about your birth control options.2. You should wait 18 months before getting pregnantIt's safe to get pregnant after bariatric surgery  after your weight stabilizes. After surgery, your body goes through potentially stressful changes and significant nutritional upheaval, which can pose problems for a growing baby.""Pregnancy after weight-loss surgery isn't an issue. The only concern is [getting pregnant] in the period of rapid weight loss,"" says Philip Schauer, director of advanced laparoscopic and bariatric surgery at the Cleveland Clinic's Bariatric and Metabolic Institute.To protect women and their babies from potential malnutrition, doctors recommend that women not get pregnant until 18 months after surgery. A report in a November 2005 issue of the Journal of Obstetric, Gynecologic, and Neonatal Nursing explained that getting pregnant at least 18 months after surgery reduces the ""potential for maternal and fetal malnutrition and small-for-gestational-age infants."" By then, Schauer says, a woman should have reached a stable weight and be able to provide her baby with enough nutrition. 3. You'll need to monitor your nutrient intake closelyEven past the initial post-surgery period, many women have nutritional deficiencies that can be problematic during pregnancy. A study in the April 2006 issue of the American Journal of Medical Science found that the most common nutritional complications associated with bariatric surgery are deficiencies in B12, iron, calcium, and vitamin D. In some cases, post-surgery patients can experience protein-calorie malnutrition and fat malabsorption. After surgery, many women eat as few as 500 calories a day and often have to take extra vitamins to compensate for the ways in which their bodies no longer metabolize nutrients.It may be extra difficult to get the nutrients you need during pregnancy because of nausea  a common post-surgery complication that morning sickness can exacerbate. If nausea has killed your appetite or you can't keep food down, talk to your healthcare provider about antinausea drugs that you can safely take during pregnancy.To make sure you and your baby are getting enough nutrients, see a nutritionist who's knowledgeable about weight-loss surgery. You can find a nutritionist (also called a dietitian) on the American Dietetic Association website  just click on Find a Nutrition Professional. Tell her what kind of surgery you had, how much weight you've gained during pregnancy so far, and your nutritional likes or dislikes. She may recommend that you eat several small meals throughout the day, which improves nutrient absorption.You should also have your provider check your vitamin levels regularly. She may suggest that you take additional vitamin supplements.4. You may need to educate your ob-gynSince the weight-loss surgery boom is relatively recent, many ob-gyns don't know how to treat women who've had it. Moms who have had the surgery say they've been put in the awkward position of educating their obstetricians.""I'm their guinea pig,"" joked Kimberly Jensen, a stay-at-home mom to Ethan in Cheyenne, Wyoming, when she was pregnant after weight-loss surgery. ""They're learning how to treat women who've had weight-loss surgery through me. I'm only their first or second patient who's had the surgery.""If you've had weight-loss surgery and you recently got pregnant or want to get pregnant, start the ball rolling by talking to all your healthcare providers early, recommends Phelan. This will give them a chance to do some research and have the most up-to-date facts at hand when caring for your health. 5. Your risk of complications drops, but doesn't go awayA 2005 study in the journal Obstetrics and Gynecology found that women who had weight-loss surgery developed pregnancy-induced hypertension and gestational diabetes at rates similar to those of healthy-weight women who'd never been obese or had weight-loss surgery.But since many women who get weight-loss surgery are still plus-size to some degree when they become pregnant, moms-to-be can expect their doctors to keep a closer watch on their pregnancies, says Sharon Phelan, an obstetrician in Albuquerque, New Mexico, who has treated many plus-size women during pregnancy, including women who have had weight-loss surgery.""You're still at risk for gestational diabetes [if you're plus-size but have had weight-loss surgery], but the risk is far less than before surgery,"" says Phelan.For example, Celeste Olivares, a 41-year-old nurse and mother of two, lost more than 150 pounds from gastric banding and was 237 pounds when she became pregnant with her first child in 2005. Her diabetes and cardiomyopathy (a form of heart inflammation) had gone away completely after the weight loss, but she continued to monitor her blood sugar during pregnancy. At 30 weeks, her blood sugar rose slightly and her doctor put her on insulin as a protective measure.6. You may face a body-image battleOne of the biggest emotional effects of pregnancy for post-surgery women, says Phelan, arises from body image. Not only does a woman have to get used to the idea that her belly will grow again, but she may also have some scars from the surgery that don't stretch very well as she grows.""Psychologically, a lot of women who've had surgery to lose weight have a very hard time accepting that they have to gain weight,"" says Phelan. ""They have to get comfortable with the fact that 'Yes, now is the time to gain weight.' Another emotional part of pregnancy is that it's stressful and people tend to eat when they're stressed.""So women run the risk of going to extremes  either dieting while pregnant, which can have serious nutritional consequences for the baby, or gaining back some of the weight they lost because they're eating more food. There's also the problem of food pushers, Phelan notes. These are the people who, seeing you're pregnant, say, ""Go ahead, have another slice of cake!""Kimberly Jensen says she did worry about gaining weight during her pregnancy. ""Everyone told me not to worry about weight gain,"" she says. ""But that was my biggest fear, gaining weight. It's tricky because you can be dieting even though you don't think you're dieting. The key is to think about the baby before you eat, so you're thinking about what's best for him.""7. You're more likely to have a cesareanPregnant women who've had bariatric surgery are more likely to end up with a c-section, according to a 2004 study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology. It's not clear exactly why this is the case and what factors are involved, but it helps to talk to your healthcare provider.Does your provider consider you at high risk for a c-section, and if so, why? Ask about your provider's c-section rate and philosophy about c-sections in general. If you have no serious health problems, is the provider fine with trying vaginal delivery? During a vaginal delivery, what might cause your provider to order a c-section intervention?Also, you may be able reduce your odds of having a c-section by following your doctor's weight-gain recommendations, exercising during pregnancy, and taking childbirth preparation classes.Learn more about c-sections and what the recovery is like."

Black women and pregnancy: Obesity,https://www.babycenter.com/0_black-women-and-pregnancy-obesity_10326267.bc,"What is obesity?When someone has more body fat than is ideal for her height and build, we say she's overweight. If she's overweight by 20 percent or more, she's considered obese.The most common way to determine obesity is the body mass index (BMI). You can figure out your BMI by using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's BMI calculator or by following these steps:Multiply your weight in pounds by 703.Divide that answer by your height in inches.Divide that number again by your height in inches.For example, a woman who weighs 140 pounds and is 5 feet 5 inches (or 65 inches) tall has a BMI of 23.3, while a woman who weighs 160 pounds and is 5 feet 5 inches has a BMI of 26.6.In general, the federal guidelines say, a BMI of 25 to 29.9 means you're overweight and a BMI of 30 and above is defined as obese. A BMI of 18.5 to 24.9 is considered normal and healthy.Although the BMI is a quick and easy way to measure the relationship between your weight and your height, obesity is determined by body fat, not just weight. Someone who weighs more than normal but is very muscular and has relatively little body fat might have a high BMI but is not obese. (Athletes often fall into this category.) At the other extreme, someone who is at normal weight or underweight can have excessive body fat.What health problems are linked to obesity?Being overweight puts you at an increased risk for many diseases and health conditions, including high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes, stroke, coronary heart disease, high blood cholesterol and triglycerides (dyslipidemia), and gallbladder disease.Being overweight or obese can cause serious pregnancy-related problems, including labor and delivery complications, birth defects, fetal and neonatal death, and delivery of a large baby. Also, overweight pregnant women are more susceptible to certain conditions such as preeclampsia, , and gestational hypertension. These risks go up as the mother's BMI increases.While any woman of any race can be overweight, the condition is more common among African American women. Also, several studies have indicated that overweight blacks are more likely to have pregnancy complications than overweight Caucasians.The good news is that most of these complications are manageable and, in some cases, preventable  and you may not experience any of them. You could have a perfectly healthy pregnancy and delivery even if you're overweight or obese.That said, pregnancy is a good time to change behaviors associated with obesity to improve your long-term health and help give your new baby a healthy start in life. If you adopt a healthy diet and make physical activity a part of your daily routine, you'll set a better example for your new child. Why is it especially important for black women to know about obesity?The number of Americans who are obese has risen dramatically among the general U.S. population in the past 40 years, and the highest rates are among African American women. Nearly 80 percent of African American women age 20 or older are overweight or obese compared with 58 percent of white women in the same age group.Fifteen percent of black women are obese, compared with 5 percent of white women.Studies show that several cultural factors may contribute to the high rates of obesity among African American women. Those include unhealthy diets, not enough physical activity, and a greater acceptance of larger body types in the African American community.Twenty-eight percent of African Americans have a poor diet, compared with 16 percent of whites, and black women report exercising less than Caucasian women.What are the risks to my baby and me if I'm overweight or obese during pregnancy?Being overweight or obese can lead to pregnancy complications and a difficult labor and delivery. An overweight pregnant woman is four times more likely to be hospitalized, and if her BMI is over 35, the risk is increased to six or seven times, according to Geddis Abel-Bey, an ob-gyn with a private practice in Queens.A pregnant overweight or obese woman is also at risk for the following:Preeclampsia This serious disorder occurs when a pregnant woman has high blood pressure and protein in her urine after 20 weeks of pregnancy. Untreated preeclampsia can cause serious to fatal complications in both mother and baby.Preeclampsia affects 3 to 8 percent of pregnant women, and it's more common among African Americans. African Americans often develop the condition earlier and in a more severe form than Caucasians.Studies have shown that about 9 to 12 percent of overweight and obese women are diagnosed with preeclampsia, while 4 to 5 percent of women with a BMI in the 19 to 25 range develop the condition.Gestational hypertension If you develop high blood pressure after 20 weeks of pregnancy but don't have protein in your urine, you'll be diagnosed with gestational hypertension, sometimes called pregnancy-induced hypertension. If the hypertension is severe, it can cause intrauterine growth restriction and low birth weight.Several studies have shown that roughly 10 percent of obese women (BMI of 30 or above) will have gestational hypertension, versus around 4 percent of women with a BMI of 19 to 25.This type of diabetes develops during pregnancy. Like other forms of diabetes, gestational diabetes affects the way your body uses sugar (glucose)  your body's main source of fuel.Gestational diabetes can cause high blood sugar levels that are unlikely to lead to problems for you, but if left untreated, the baby faces an increased risk of being born too large (9 pounds 15 ounces or more). The chances for birth defects and stillbirth also go up.About 6 percent of overweight women and 9 percent of obese women develop gestational diabetes, while 2 percent of women with a BMI of 19 to 24 develop it.You can manage gestational diabetes by gaining only the recommended weight during pregnancy (see below), eating healthy foods, exercising regularly, and, if necessary, taking medication.Preterm birth If you deliver your baby before 37 weeks, your baby is considered premature and is at an increased risk for health complications. About 12 percent of babies in the United States are born prematurely, and the risk is greater if the mother is overweight. One study found that among obese women, the risk for preterm birth is highest among blacks, while whites and Hispanics both had significantly lower levels of risk.Longer labor Overweight women progress through labor more slowly than women at a healthy weight, some studies have found. They're also more likely to have irregular contractions during the first stage of labor and more likely to receive oxytocin to induce labor.Hard-to-place epidural There's no evidence suggesting that epidurals don't work as well specifically in larger women. However it can sometimes be more difficult to get the medication where it needs to go, which can affect your pain relief.One study stated that epidural pain relief in labor is more often ""ineffective"" in obese women, due solely to whether the anesthesiologist managed to get the needle into the spine properly. It can be more difficult for an anesthesiologist to place the epidural if he can't feel the spine as easily under extra fatty tissue, but once the needle is in  and there are various needle lengths to suit all sizes of patients  and the appropriate medicine has been given, it should work just as well as it would on a smaller woman.C-section Overweight women are twice as likely to require a surgical delivery as women with a normal BMI. When an overweight woman has a c-section, complications related to anesthesia, infections at the incision site, and life-threatening pulmonary embolism (a blockage of an artery in the lungs by fat, air, tumor tissue, or blood clot) are generally more common. The baby of an obese woman is at risk for the following complications:Birth defects Overweight women are more likely to have a baby with birth defects, especially neural tube defects (NTDs). They're also 30 to 40 percent more likely to deliver a baby with major birth defects that affect the brain, heart, and digestive system.Folic acid supplements, which are usually effective in preventing NTDs and other birth defects, may not be as protective in overweight women, according to some studies.Macrosomia Babies of obese women are more likely to weigh 9 pounds or more, and when the baby is more than 9 pounds 15 ounces, it's a condition known as macrosomia. Women who deliver large babies are more susceptible to injuries during vaginal delivery. Also, women who previously delivered a macrosomic baby are five to ten times more likely than women without such a history to deliver a large baby the next time they're pregnant, especially if they remain obese.Childhood obesity The effect of your weight on your child doesn't end at birth. In a study of African American children, being born to an overweight mother increased a child's risk for being overweight later in life. This is mainly because the behaviors associated with being overweight are learned at home.Childhood obesity is a growing problem in the African American community. Studies show that almost 36 percent of black children between the ages of 6 and 11 are overweight, and more than 19 percent are considered obese. Pregnancy is a good time to change your eating and exercise behaviors and stop the generational effect.Also, there is evidence suggesting that obesity in pregnant women creates an unhealthy fetal environment that increases the baby's risk for obesity later in life. It's as if the thermostat for body fat percentage is set in utero.For more information on the risks associated with obesity, read Baby Center's article Plus-size and pregnant: Understanding and managing health risks. How is obesity managed during pregnancy?Pregnancy and obesity can be a challenging combination. But a healthy pregnancy is possible by properly managing weight gain, taking good care of yourself, and working closely with your healthcare provider. Here are some important tips:See a healthcare provider before pregnancy. If you're overweight, meet with a doctor or midwife for a physical and preconception counseling before you get pregnant if you possibly can. Early visits give your healthcare provider a chance to educate, screen for risks, and evaluate any medications you're taking. Also, your provider will probably suggest that you try to reach a more healthy weight several months before conceiving.Watch your weight, but don't diet. Once you're pregnant, your healthcare provider will probably discourage you from going on a weight-loss diet. Restricting your food intake is potentially hazardous to you and your developing baby. Your provider may suggest the same 2,000-calorie-per-day diet he would recommend to any other woman.That said, in the first trimester, it's common to lose weight as the result of morning sickness: The nausea can diminish your appetite, and the vomiting can cause you to miss out on calories. But don't worry, your baby will still get all the necessary calories. Overweight women have an extra reserve of calories in stored fat, so as your baby grows, it's okay for you to maintain or even lose a little weight in the first trimester.Eat healthy. Ask your healthcare provider about seeing a nutritionist who can help you adopt healthier eating habits, direct you to foods that will satisfy your hunger, and suggest nutrient-packed meals that will help your baby grow.""An overweight woman has to focus on what they call a nutrient-dense diet. Foods that are nutrient dense, such as whole grains, beans, vegetables, low-fat dairy, and lean protein, provide a high nutrient-to-calorie ratio. Foods with low nutrient density have a lot of fat and sugar but basically no other nutrients,"" says ob-gyn Abel-Bey.You can use our handy pregnancy food diary to make sure you're getting enough nutrients and drinking plenty of water every day.Exercise: Unless there's a medical reason not to exercise, moderate exercise of 30 minutes or more several days a week is recommended. Ideally, start exercising before you become pregnant. Studies show that physical activity in morbidly obese women (BMI greater than 35) can help reduce the risk of developing conditions in pregnancy such as gestational diabetes.Be sure to consult your caregiver before starting any sort of exercise program. And stop exercising immediately if you have any of these symptoms: vaginal bleeding, shortness of breath before exercise, dizziness, headache, chest pain, muscle weakness, calf pain or swelling, preterm contractions, leaking of amniotic fluid, or your baby isn't moving as much.For more information, read our article on pregnancy exercise for beginners.Attend prenatal appointments. Your healthcare provider will monitor you and your baby closely during pregnancy by checking your blood pressure and discussing recommended weight gain, and using ultrasounds and fetal heart monitoring to check on your baby. You may also be screened twice for gestational diabetes, first at the beginning of your pregnancy and again in your second or third trimester.Get more tips from our article on how to manage your weight during pregnancy.If I'm overweight exactly how much weight should I gain during pregnancy?It depends on how much you weighed before you conceived and how appropriate that weight is for your height. As a comparison, experts advise women with a healthy BMI  18.5 to 24.9  to gain between 25 and 35 pounds.If you're overweight for your height (a BMI of 25 to 29.9), you should gain between 15 and 25 pounds by the end of your pregnancy, at a rate of approximately 2 to 3 pounds a month, primarily in your second and third trimesters. It's normal not to gain any weight at all during the first trimester, when morning sickness is at its worst.Obese women (those with a BMI of 30 or higher) should gain between 11 and 20 pounds.If you're having twins, you should gain 31 to 50 pounds if you're overweight, and 25 to 42 pounds if you're obese.Use our pregnancy weight gain estimator to get an idea of how much you should gain (based on your height and pre-pregnancy weight) and to see how the pounds are distributed."
The 10 best foods for babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-10-best-foods-for-babies_10320505.bc,"There are lots of healthy, baby-friendly foods out there, but these 10 recommended by doctors and nutritionists alike stand out from the pack. From vitamin-rich fruits and veggies to meats and beans loaded with protein, these superfoods are full of essential nutrients, reasonably priced, easy to prepare, and delicious.Many are also favorite first foods.

Discover creative ways to prepare five different superfoods loaded with the nutrients that every growing baby needs. See all videosBroccoliThis cruciferous vegetable contains fiber, folate, and calcium, and may even help ward off cancer. Introduce your baby tobroccoli's bold flavorearly, and you'll be expanding his tastes and encouraging a lifelong love of green vegetables.Serving idea:Steam until soft, cut into pieces small enough for your child to eat safely, and then chill. Steaming takes the bite out of broccoli, and some babies prefer the texture and taste when it's cold.LentilsBeans and other legumes pack lots of lean protein and fiber. But unlike larger beans, little lentils simmer into a pleasing mush just right for baby bites. They're also one of the cheapest healthy foods you can buy.Serving ideas: Cook finely diced carrots along with the lentils. As your baby gets older, double up on nutrient-rich foods by makinglentil and spinach stew.MeatLack of iron can cause anemia. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends meat as a first food because it's such a great source of protein, zinc, and iron, especially red meat and dark poultry meat. Plus babies absorb iron more easily from meat than from iron-fortified cereals, another common first food.Serving ideas:If your baby is new to solids, try our easyturkey or chicken pureerecipe. As she gets older, introduce new flavors withchicken curry with green beans and zucchiniorshepherd's pie.PrunesWhether you call them ""prunes"" or ""dried plums,"" these humble fruits dont sound glamorous  but they're soft, sweet, and full of fiber. Your baby may suffer fromconstipation when switching to solids, as it's a big change for her system. Add pureed prunes to her diet to aid digestion and keep things moving.Serving ideas: Serve pureed prunes alone or mixed with other foods, such as oatmeal, cereal, or applesauce, for a naturally sweet treat.Sweet potatoesSweet potatoes are one of the more popular first foods for babies, who tend to like both their sweetness and texture. These colorful root vegetables are packed with beta-carotene, vitamin C, and minerals, including iron and copper.Serving ideas: Serve sweet potato puree alone or swirled into pureed chicken or turkey.Winter squashOrange- or yellow-fleshed hard winter squashes such as butternut, acorn, and pumpkin boast many benefits, one of which is they're exceptionally rich in beta-carotene, recognized for being great for eyes. Squash is also an excellent source of vitamin C. Natural sweetness and a creamy texture add to the appeal of winter varieties.Serving ideas: Roast a winter squash like butternut, scoop out the flesh, and puree it for an easy first food. As your baby gets older, introduce new flavors and textures with dishes like smashed chickpea and butternut chili.YogurtCreamyyogurtis rich in calcium and vitamin D, necessary for healthy bones and teeth. Your baby canhave itat 4 to 6 months, long before he'll be ready forcow's milk.Opt for plain yogurt with no added sugar. Also look for a brand with the most live cultures, which help regulate the good bacteria in your baby's digestive tract.

Essential fatty acids in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_essential-fatty-acids-in-your-childs-diet_10324690.bc,"Essential fatty acids are crucial for children's good health and development. Read on to find out which essential fatty acids your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Why essential fatty acids are importantEssential fatty acids, or EFAs, are types of fat that are essential in the diet because they can't be produced by the body. These fats help build cells, regulate the nervous system, strengthen the cardiovascular system, build immunity, and help the body absorb nutrients. EFAs are also vital for healthy brain function and vision.Essential fatty acids include omega-6 (linoleic acid) and omega-3 (linolenic acid). Both are polyunsaturated fats that help lower cholesterol, reduce inflammation, and keep the heart healthy.Most Americans consume a lot more omega-6 fats than omega-3 fats. Some experts maintain that an imbalance of omega-6 fats to omega-3 fats can impair immune and inflammatory responses in the body and may contribute to such illnesses as heart disease and type 2 diabetes.Other experts and organizations, including the American Heart Association, say striving for balance isn't important. Instead, they simply recommend boosting the amount of omega-3 in your diet.Types of omega-3There are three main types of omega 3 fatty acids: alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA).Plant-based ALA is a fatty acid found in flaxseeds, walnuts, kale, and soybean oil. When consumed, the body partially converts ALA into DHA and EPA. (It's also found in some types of animal fat.)Marine-based DHA and EPA can be found in fatty fish, including salmon, mackerel, sardines, rainbow trout, and herring.Omega-3s contribute to health in different ways. For example, DHA is critical to brain and eye development. This is why infant formula is fortified with DHA and why pregnant and breastfeeding women are encouraged to get DHA in their diet, either from a food source or a supplement.Experts say both vegetable and fish omega-3s are good for your health, but no one knows for sure if ALA has all the health benefits associated with DHA and EPA. Since plant-based omega-3 only partially converts to DHA and EPA, consuming fatty fish like salmon is important.To make the most of all the health benefits of omega-3s, experts say to get both plant- and marine-based omega-3s.Omega-6 and omega-3: How much does my child need?Ages 1 to 3 years:7,000 milligrams (mg), or 7 grams, of omega-6 daily700 mg, or 0.7 grams, of omega-3 dailyAges 4 to 8 years:10,000 mg, or 10 grams, of omega-6 daily900 mg, or 0.9 grams, of omega-3 dailyOmega-6 fats are usually plentiful in the diet, and it's likely you only need to focus on making sure your child is getting adequate omega-3s. (Many omega-6 fats come from processed foods that contain oils such as soybean oil.)Your child doesn't have to get enough essential fatty acids every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of essential fatty acidsGood sources of omega-3s include:1 teaspoon flaxseed oil: 2,395 mg (not recommended for cooking but good for dressings)1 tablespoon flax seeds, ground: 1,597 mg1/4 cup English walnuts: 2,293 mg1 tablespoon fortified peanut butter: 4,950 mg1 teaspoon walnut oil: 466 mg1 teaspoon wheat germ oil: 310 mg1 teaspoon soybean oil: 300 mg1 teaspoon canola oil: 411 mg1 fortified egg: 100 mg4 ounces tofu: 300 mg1 ounce salmon: 425 mg1/2 cup soybeans (dried, cooked): 500 mg1/2 cup cooked kale: 100 mgLook for foods that have been fortified with omega-3s, such as peanut butter, milk, yogurt, orange juice, margarine, and eggs. The omega-3 content will vary with the brand, so read the label. You'll find fortified eggs containing 100 to 200 mg or more omega-3 fatty acids, for example.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Most of us get more than enough omega-6 (primarily from vegetable oils). Choosing fats that are rich in omega-3 ensures your child gets enough of that, too. Just a teaspoon of canola oil, for instance, contains about half the omega-3s most children need in a day.(Note: Nuts and seeds are not appropriate for very small children because they pose a choking hazard. For the same reason, nut butters should be spread thinly.)Your child will most likely get all the omega-6 fats he needs from processed foods that contain safflower, sunflower, corn, and soybean oils:1 teaspoon safflower oil: 3,360 mg1 teaspoon sunflower oil: 2,966 mg1 teaspoon corn oil: 2,400 mg1 teaspoon soybean oil: 2,300 mgCan your child get too much essential fatty acids?No, your child can't get too much of either of the essential fatty acids  but he can get too much fat in his overall diet. As a general rule, choose mostly fats rich in omega-3 and avoid trans fats and saturated fats.Trans fats  often identified on labels as ""partially hydrogenated oils""  are found in many fried foods (like french fries), baked goods (like cookies, pastries, pizza dough), and stick margarines and shortenings. They're also found in some dairy products and meats.Trans fats raise LDL (""bad"") cholesterol and lower HDL (""good"") cholesterol. They also increase the risk of developing heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.Saturated fats come mostly from animal sources like meat and dairy  fatty meats, lard, cream, butter, and cheese  and are usually solid at room temperature. They're also found in baked and fried foods and some plant foods, like palm oil, palm kernel oil, and coconut oil.To learn more see ten other important nutrients for children and how to avoid mercury in fish.Show sources Hide sources Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. 2011.

Potassium in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_potassium-in-your-childs-diet_10324692.bc,"Potassium is crucial for good health and development. Read on to find out how much potassium your child needs, the best sources, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Find out more: Nine other important nutrients for childrenWhy potassium is importantPotassium works with sodium to control the body's water balance, which helps maintain healthy blood pressure. In fact, a diet that's low in potassium and high in sodium appears to be a factor in high blood pressure. Potassium also helps with muscle function and heart rhythm and, in later years, may reduce the risk of kidney stones and osteoporosis.The American Dietetic Association has identified potassium as one of the nutrients school-age children are lacking.How much potassium does your child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 3,000 milligrams (mg) per dayAges 4 to 8 years: 3,800 mg per dayYour child doesn't have to get the recommended daily amount of potassium every day, however. Instead, aim for the daily amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Child Growth Chart CalculatorCreate a growth chart to see how your child measures up against other children in height, weight, and head size.Good sources of potassiumFresh fruits and vegetables are a great source of potassium. Milk, meat, and cereals also contain potassium, but it's not as readily absorbed from these sources. Some of the best sources:1/2 medium baked potato: 463 mg1/2 cup prune juice: 352 mg1/4 cup prunes: 318 mg1/4 cup raisins: 299 mg1/2 cup tomato juice: 278 mg1/4 cup white beans: 251 mg1/2 cup orange juice: 248 mg1/4 cup lima beans: 242 mg1 ounce sunflower seeds: 241 mg1/4 cup acorn squash: 224 mg1/2 medium banana: 211 mg1/4 cup cooked spinach: 210 mg1/2 cup cantaloupe: 208 mg1 ounce almonds: 200 mg1/2 medium tomato: 146 mg1/2 cup bran cereal with raisins: 181 mg1/2 medium orange: 118 mg1/4 cup honeydew: 97 mg2 deglet noor dates: 94 mg1/2 cup watermelon: 85 mgThe amount of potassium in a food will vary somewhat, depending on the size of the fruit or the brand of product. Note that some foods (like dried fruits and nuts) are choking hazards for very young children, and nut butter should be thinly spread for the same reason.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts of food shown, given their age and appetite. You can estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can your child get too much potassium?Yes, although it's highly unlikely. The Institute of Medicine has not determined an upper intake level for potassium, which would be the maximum amount considered safe.It's important for the body to maintain a good potassium balance. Too much potassium can cause a condition called hyperkalemia. Too little dietary potassium or loss of potassium through severe vomiting or diarrhea can cause hypokalemia.Side effects of an imbalance include fatigue, muscle weakness and cramps, intestinal problems, and even abnormal heart rhythms."
Vitamin E in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-e-in-your-childs-diet_10324697.bc,"Vitamin E is crucial for children's good health and development. Read on to find out how much vitamin E your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for childrenWhy vitamin E is importantVitamin E boosts the immune system and helps the body fight germs. Vitamin E also keeps blood vessels open wide enough for blood to flow freely, and it helps the cells of the body work together to perform many important functions.How much vitamin E does my child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 6 milligrams (mg), or 9 international units (IU) of vitamin E, dailyAges 4 to 8 years: 7 mg, or 10.5 IU, dailyMany children don't get enough vitamin E from diet alone, but it's rare to have a vitamin E deficiency severe enough to cause health issues. Getting slightly less than the recommended amount of vitamin E is common among both adults and kids in the United States.Your child doesn't have to get enough vitamin E every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of vitamin EVitamin E can be found in a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, nuts, and seeds. Here are some of the best food sources of vitamin E:1 ounce dry roasted almonds: 7 mg1 teaspoon wheat germ oil: 6 mg1 ounce dry roasted sunflower seeds: 6 mg1 tablespoon almond butter: 4 mg1 tablespoon sunflower seed butter: 4 mg1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter: 2 mg1 ounce dry roasted peanuts: 2 mg1 teaspoon sunflower oil: 1.8 mg1 teaspoon safflower oil: 1.5 mg1/2 medium kiwi (peeled): 1 mg1 teaspoon corn oil: 0.6 mg1/4 cup cooked frozen spinach: 0.8 mg1/4 cup cooked frozen broccoli: 0.6 mg1 teaspoon soybean oil: 0.4 mg1/4 cup raw mango: 0.9 mgThe amount of vitamin E in a food varies somewhat, depending on the size of the item or the brand of the product. Note that nuts and seeds are choking hazards for very young children, and nut butters should be spread thinly for the same reason.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, depending on their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much vitamin E?It's far more likely that your child won't get enough of this vital nutrient. But because vitamin E can act as an anticoagulant, which increases the risk of bleeding problems, the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine has set upper intake levels for vitamin E. (This is the maximum amount that's considered safe.)A 2- or 3-year-old child should not get more than 200 mg (300 IU) of vitamin E daily. A 4- to 8-year-old child should not get more than 300 mg (450 IU) of vitamin E daily.Show sources Hide sources IOM. 2001.

Smart shopping tips for choosing organic fruits and vegetables,https://www.babycenter.com/0_smart-shopping-tips-for-choosing-organic-fruits-and-vegetabl_10350272.bc,"By definition, organic produce refers to fruits and vegetables grown without the use of most synthetic pesticides.If you'd like to buy organic food but find it's too expensive, you can prioritize by buying organic versions of the Dirty Dozen  12 fruits and vegetables found to have the highest levels of pesticide residue.The list is updated each year by the nonprofit organization Environmental Working Group (EWG) using the latest test results from the United States Department of Agriculture. Foods are listed in order, beginning with produce with the most pesticide residue:StrawberriesApplesNectarinesPeachesCeleryGrapesCherriesSpinachTomatoesSweet bell peppersCherry tomatoesCucumbersOr check out the complete list of all the fruits and vegetables tested, in order from the most to the least pesticide contamination.EWG also lists the Clean Fifteen  the fruits and vegetables least likely to have traces of pesticides. Top foods on this list include avocados, sweet corn, pineapples, cabbage, and frozen sweet peas.These lists can guide your food shopping: You might want to splurge on organic versions of foods that are higher in pesticide residues, especially if your family eats them often, but save money by buying conventionally grown produce that's lower in pesticides.Keep in mind that it's much better to eat conventionally grown produce than to skip it altogether to avoid pesticides. Fruits and vegetables have nutrients and health benefits everyone needs, especially pregnant women and children.You can minimize pesticide exposure by washing or peeling your fruits and veggies before eating them. This also helps get rid of bacteria and other organisms that could cause food poisoning.

The Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and American Academy of Pediatrics agree that well-planned vegetarian and vegan diets are fine for infants and toddlers. Just pay attention to make sure your child gets plenty of the following nutrients:Vitamin B12: Vegetarians can get this nutrient from milk products and eggs. Vegans can use fortified soy beverages, cereals, and meat substitutes.Vitamin D: Breastfed babies should get an additional 400 IU per day from fortified cow's milk or soy milk.Calcium: Vegan babies may need calcium-fortified foods, beverages, or supplements. Check with your doctor or a dietitian.Zinc: This important nutrient helps the immune system and can be found in beans, fortified cereal, milk, and wheat germ.Iron: You can find this mineral in iron-fortified cereal or supplements. Serve with foods high in vitamin C  like oranges, tomatoes, and strawberries  to improve iron absorption.Protein: Vegetarians can get added protein from yogurt and eggs. Vegans can get plant proteins from beans, cereals, and fortified soy milk.Fiber: Good sources of fiber include whole grain breads, fortified cereals and pastas, and high-fat plant foods like sunflower butter and avocados.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Weaning: When and how to stop breastfeeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_weaning-when-and-how-to-stop-breastfeeding_3272.bc,"What does it mean to have weaned a child?Your baby is considered weaned when he stops nursing and gets all his nutrition from sources other than the breast. Although babies are also weaned from the bottle, the term usually refers to when a baby stops breastfeeding.Weaning doesn't necessarily signal the end of the intimate bond you and your child created through nursing. It just means you're nourishing and nurturing him in different ways.For example, if you often nursed your child for comfort, you'll have to find other ways to make him feel better. Read a book, sing a song together, or play outside instead. If your child protests, try to stay calm and be firm. If you need to, hand him to your partner for a cuddle.When should I start weaning?You're the best judge of when it's time to wean, and you don't have to set a deadline until you and your child are ready. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that mothers breastfeed for at least a year  and encourages women to breastfeed even longer if both you and your baby want to.Despite what friends, relatives, or even strangers may say, there's no right or wrong way to wean. You can choose a time that feels right to you, or let your child wean naturally when she's older.Baby-led weaning: Weaning is easiest when your child begins to lose interest in nursing, and that can happen any time after she starts eating solids (around 4 to 6 months). Some babies are more interested in solid food than breast milk by 12 months, after they've tried a variety of foods and can drink from a cup.Toddlers may become less interested in nursing when they grow more active and aren't inclined to sit still long enough to nurse. If your child is fussy and impatient while nursing or is easily distracted, she may be giving you signs that she's ready.Mother-led weaning: You may decide to start weaning because you're returning to work. Or maybe it just feels like the right time. If you're ready but your child isn't showing signs she wants to stop nursing, you can wean her off the breast gradually.When it's the mother's idea, weaning can take a lot of time and patience. It also depends on your child's age and how she adjusts to change.It's a good idea to avoid the 'cold turkey' approach to weaning. For example, a weekend away from your baby or toddler is not a good way to end the breastfeeding relationship. Experts say that abruptly withholding your breast can be traumatic for your baby and could cause plugged ducts or a breast infection for you.How do I wean?Go slowly, and expect to see signs of frustration from your baby at first. Ease the transition by using these methods:Skip a feeding. See what happens if you offer a bottle or cup of milk instead of nursing. You can substitute pumped breast milk, formula, or whole cow's milk (if your child is at least a year old).Reducing feedings one at a time over a period of weeks gives your child time to adjust. Your milk supply also diminishes gradually this way, without leaving your breasts engorged or causing mastitis.Shorten nursing time. Start by limiting how long your child is on the breast. If he usually nurses for ten minutes, try five.Depending on his age, follow the feeding with a healthy snack, such as unsweetened applesauce or a cup of milk or formula. (Some babies younger than 6 months may not be ready for solids.) Solid food is complementary to breast milk until your baby is a year old.Bedtime feedings may be harder to shorten because they're usually the last to go.Postpone and distract. Try postponing feedings if you're only nursing a couple of times a day.This method works well if you have an older child you can reason with. If your child asks to nurse, reassure him that you will soon and distract him with a different activity. If he wants to nurse in the early evening, explain that he has to wait until bedtime.To ease your baby's transition to a bottle, try putting a few drops of breast milk on his lips or tongue before slipping the bottle's nipple into his mouth. You can also try giving him a small amount of breast milk in a bottle a couple of hours after breastfeeding but before he's so hungry that he's impatient and frustrated.Will my child get enough nutrients?Even exclusively breastfed infants need extra nutrients that breast milk can't provide, like vitamin D. If you wean your baby before she reaches her first birthday, she'll need to continue to drink breast milk or iron-fortified formula until she's a year old. Then once your child reaches toddlerhood, it'll be necessary to give her a wider variety of foods that offer the range of nutrients she needs to help her grow.What to do when weaning becomes a struggleIf you've tried everything to wean your child and nothing is working, maybe the time isn't right.Have you recently gone back to work? Your child may still be adjusting to the new routine.Is your child sick? Babies often want to nurse more frequently when they don't feel well. And breastfeeding a sick child is not only comforting, but also a good source of nutrition.Is your household going through a major life change? Events such as a move or divorce can also make weaning more difficult. Even going through a new developmental stage can make it hard to wean.Try again in another month. Sooner or later, it'll happen.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015. Weaning your baby.

Trying to conceive? Five changes to make to your diet now,https://www.babycenter.com/0_trying-to-conceive-five-changes-to-make-to-your-diet-now_3558.bc,"Don't wait until you're pregnant to improve your eating habits. Set the stage now with healthy diet changes to ensure your baby gets off to a strong start.Pay attention to your dietFor both men and women, food and fertility are linked. Stick to a balanced diet to boost your chances of a healthy baby.Eat several servings of fruit, vegetables, whole grains, and calcium-rich foods such as yogurt, cheese, and milk every day. Not getting enough nutrients can affect your periods, making it difficult to predict when you ovulate. And you may not ovulate at all if you're significantly underweight or obese.Your partner should also pay attention to his diet since certain vitamins and nutrients  such as zinc and vitamins C and E, and folic acid  are important for making healthy sperm.How can I get pregnant quickly?

See all videosFish is a nutritional powerhouse for a growing baby, offering low-fat protein with omega-3 fatty acids, but you need to take care to avoid types that are high in mercury, which can be dangerous to your unborn baby. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration urges women to eat 8 to 12 ounces of a variety of fish each week.Because mercury can accumulate in your body and linger there for more than a year, avoid high-mercury fish such as shark, swordfish, king mackerel, and tilefish. Instead, eat lower-mercury fish such as salmon and canned light tuna (not albacore, which is higher in mercury) once or twice a week. Read more oneating fish while trying to conceive.Processed meats can be particularly dangerous for pregnant women and should be consumed in small amounts, and smoked or raw meats should be avoided entirely during pregnancy. Even hot dogs or deli meats should be heated until they are steaming before you eat them if you are pregnant.Practice good habits for pregnancyFor many moms-to-be, pregnancy prompts an abrupt change in eating and drinking habits  but some habits are hard to break. Make it easier on yourself by changing habits now, and help ensure your baby gets off to a good start from the moment you conceive.Some solid advice: The occasional bottle of beer or glass of wine probably won't affect your chances of getting pregnant, but alcohol can harm a developing baby. And since you may not know exactly when you ovulate or conceive, you may want to play it safe and cut out alcohol completely. (For non-alcoholic alternatives, see our list of the best virgin drinks).On a related note, if you use any recreational drugs or smoke, quit now. All of these substances and habits can harm a developing fetus.You may also want to cut back on caffeine. The research on whether caffeine can affect fertility is mixed. Experts generally agree that low to moderate caffeine consumption, less than 300 mg a day or about the equivalent of two 8-ounce cups of coffee, won't affect your fertility, but your healthcare provider may recommend that you cut caffeine out entirely to play it safe. Learn more aboutcaffeine and fertility.And once you're pregnant, experts recommend limiting yourself to less than 200 milligrams a day of caffeine  that's a little less than a 12-ounce cup of coffee  because higher amounts have been linked to an increased risk of miscarriage. If you have a strong coffee or soda habit, you might want to start weaning yourself off caffeine now.Take prenatal vitaminsAlthough you can meet almost all of your nutritional needs through a balanced diet, many experts believe that even the healthiest eaters can use extra help. Taking a prenatal vitamin ensures that you're getting enough folic acid and other essential nutrients to boost your chances of conceiving a healthy baby.Remember that a supplement is a safeguard, not a substitute for a sound diet. And since regular over-the-counter multivitamins may contain megadoses of vitamins and minerals that could be harmful to a developing baby, choose a pill formulated specifically for pregnant women. If you have a vegetarian diet, you may also need vitamin D and B-12 supplements, along with extra protein. Talk with your healthcare provider about the right prenatal supplement for you.Get enough folic acidFolic acid has been proven to reduce a baby's risk of neural-tube birth defects such as spina bifida, and it is linked to a lower incidence of heart attacks, strokes, cancer, and diabetes.Most women of child-bearing age should take a supplement with 400 micrograms (mcg) daily for at least a month before pregnancy, and 600 micrograms during pregnancy. If you have a family history of neural-tube birth defects or take medication for seizures, your healthcare provider may suggest that you boost your daily intake to 4,000 mcg, or 4 mg, starting at least a month before you conceive and continuing throughout your first trimester.A good over-the-counter prenatal vitamin should contain more than the minimum recommendation of folic acid, between 600 and 800 mcg  what you'll need during pregnancy. In addition, you can eat folate-rich foods, such as dark green leafy vegetables like spinach or kale, citrus fruits, nuts, legumes, whole grains, and fortified breads and cereals.Folic acid is a water-soluble vitamin, so your body will flush out the excess if you consume too much. But there's a downside to being water-soluble, too: You can lose a lot of this vitamin in cooking water, so steam or cook vegetables in a small amount of water to preserve the folate.Be aware that getting too much folate may hide a vitamin B-12 deficiency, which is sometimes a problem for vegetarians. Ask your doctor or midwife if you think you may be at risk.Maintain a healthy weightIt might be a good idea to shed some pounds, or gain a few if you're underweight, while you're trying to get pregnant, since you want to be as close as possible to your recommended weight when you conceive. Being over- or underweight can make it harder to get pregnant. Also, obese women have more pregnancy and birth complications, and underweight women are more likely to have a low-birth-weight baby.In addition to following a smart eating plan with low-fat, high-fiber foods, get regular exercise. If you're overweight, aim to lose one to two pounds a week, a safe rate of weight loss. Extreme weight loss from crash dieting can deplete your body's nutritional stores, which isn't a good way to start a pregnancy.Show sources Hide sources Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics. Undated.

Dads-to-be: Diet changes to boost your fertility,https://www.babycenter.com/0_dads-to-be-diet-changes-to-boost-your-fertility_4188.bc,"Nutrition has a direct impact on the potency of your sperm. Research shows that having a poor diet and drinking alcohol regularly, for instance, can lower the quality and quantity of sperm and make conception more difficult. And since infertility is nearly as much a man's issue as a woman's  about a third of fertility problems can be traced to men  eating healthfully now can boost your chances of conceiving a child.Additional research shows that dads who are heavy drinkers risk damaging their sperm. If you drink, have no more than one or two drinks a day.Whether drinking coffee harms or helps your fertility is less clear. The safest bet is to drink no more than a cup or two a day.Which nutrients are most important?Your diet should be every bit as balanced, varied, and nutritious as your partner's. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, research shows that a healthy diet including plenty of fish, vegetables, and whole grains means more active sperm. On the other hand, a diet high in trans fats may lower the number of sperm in semen.Some specific advice for future dads:Eat plenty of foods rich in vitamin C and other antioxidants. These nutrients help prevent sperm defects and boost motility (movement). An 8-ounce glass of orange juice has about 124 milligrams (mg) of vitamin C. Aim to get at least 90 mg a day  more if you smoke (at least 125 mg).Get enough zinc. A lack of zinc can make sperm clump together and contribute to infertility. Great sources to help you get the 11 mg you need daily include oysters (16 mg in six medium oysters), extra-lean beef tenderloin (4.8 mg per 3-ounce serving), baked beans (3.5 mg per 1-cup serving), and dark chicken meat (2.38 mg per 3-ounce serving).Fuel up on folic acid. Studies suggest that men with low levels of this key B vitamin  the same one women need to reduce the baby's risk of neural tube birth defects  have trouble producing healthy sperm. You may be able to get the daily minimum of 400 micrograms from fortified breakfast cereals, leafy greens, legumes, and orange juice, but taking a folic acid or a multivitamin supplement for extra insurance can't hurt.Cut out (or cut back on) alcohol. An occasional drink is generally considered safe, but studies show that drinking wine, beer, or hard liquor daily can reduce testosterone levels and sperm counts and raise the number of abnormal sperm in your ejaculate.Take a multivitamin tablet every day. A pill is no substitute for a healthy diet, but a multivitamin can help you make sure you're getting the nutrients you need.Show sources Hide sources American Dietetic Association. Undated.

Our food experts offer strategies for your no-fruit kid.See all eight picky eaters here.The No-Fruit KidThe dilemma: Your little one regards snack staples such as apple slices, orange sections, and bananas with utter disdain.The nutritional concern: Like vegetables, fruits are chock full of vitamins, minerals, and fiber  all necessary nutrients for your child's developing body.Ann Cooper, nutrition expert who revamps school cafeterias around the country and coauthor of Lunch Lessons: If you want your children to try new fruits and veggies, cook, shop, and grow healthy food with them. When kids participate in the process, they're much more likely to try new things.Missy Chase Lapine, mother of two and author of The Sneaky Chef: What kid do you know who doesn't like Popsicles? Make your own with pomegranate or cherry juice to get all those great nutrients in an icy cold treat. I also add a purple puree full of blueberries to meat dishes  like taco filling  to get the benefits of this vitamin-rich fruit.Vicki Lansky, mother of two, grandmother of three, and author of Feed Me I'm Yours: Fruits and vegetables offer a lot of the same vitamins and minerals. So if your child dislikes fruit but does eat vegetables, then she's probably getting a lot of the nutrients she needs. If she eats red peppers instead of oranges, she's still getting vitamin C.Jennifer Iserloh, private chef and author of Secrets of a Skinny Chef: I have one word for you: Popsicles. Make your own using low-fat yogurt and berries. I also find that kids love things like bananas rolled in low-fat sour cream and coconut.

Butter or spray only the bottom, not the sides, of a 13-by-9-inch or a 9-inch-square baking pan.Melt the butter and chocolate chips together in a double boiler or metal bowl over simmering water (or in a microwave, checking every 15 seconds). Remove from heat and allow mixture to cool a bit.Meanwhile, in another bowl, stir together the eggs, vanilla, sugar, and Purple Puree. Combine this purple egg mixture with the cooled chocolate mixture.In a mixing bowl, stir together Flour Blend, cocoa powder, oats, and salt. Add this to the chocolate mixture and blend thoroughly. Mix in the chopped walnuts, if using, then pour the entire mixture into the baking pan.Bake for 30 to 35 minutes, until a toothpick comes out clean. Allow to cool completely in the pan before cutting the brownies. Dust with powdered sugar, if desired.Brownies will keep for a week in the refrigerator, covered tightly.Makes about 30 kid-size brownies.Note: Use a plastic knife for easier cutting if you're going to eat the brownies while warm.Purple PureeBy Missy Chase LapineIngredients:3 cups raw baby spinach leaves (or 1 cup frozen chopped spinach or frozen chopped collard greens)1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries (no syrup or sugar added)1/2 teaspoon lemon juice1 to 2 tablespoons waterInstructions:Wash raw spinach thoroughly, even if the package says ""prewashed."" Bring spinach or collards and water to a boil in a medium pot. Turn heat to low and let simmer for 10 minutes. If using frozen blueberries, quickly rinse them under cold water to thaw a little, and then drain.Fill the bowl of your food processor with the blueberries and cooked greens, along with the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of water. Puree on high until as smooth as possible. Stop occasionally to scrape sides. If necessary, use a second tablespoon of water to make a fairly smooth puree.The puree can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days, or you can freeze 1/4-cup portions in sealed plastic bags or small plastic containers.Makes 1 cup of puree.Note: Double the recipe if you'd like to make extra puree to store for later use.

Quick and healthy breakfasts for kids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_quick-and-healthy-breakfasts-for-kids_1186670.bc,"Finding time to make your child breakfast  not to mention getting him to eat it  can be a struggle. The good news is that you don't have to prepare a complete meal every morning. To get your child going, you just need to make sure he gets food that will provide a dose of energy and at least a few essential nutrients. Here are some ways to give him what he needs.No time to linger: Breakfast in secondsGranola bars. Loaded with fiber from whole grains, granola bars are a great source of energy in the form of carbohydrates. Studies show that children are mentally sharper when they've eaten something, and brain cells need a constant supply of carbohydrates. Just watch out for granola bars that are more like candy bars  choose varieties that are lower in sugar.Whole wheat bagel with peanut butter. Whole grain bagels, such as whole wheat and rye, have more fiber than plain or seeded varieties. Peanut butter is great source of protein, and most of the good fats in the ""natural"" varieties helps keep arteries healthy.Oat bran muffin. With more fiber and less fat than a typical blueberry muffin, oat bran muffins also provide surprising amounts of potassium and magnesium.Fruit. Apples are not only refreshing but also high in fiber. Bananas top other fresh fruits as a source of potassium, a mineral that kids lose during physical activity. Fruit staves off a midmorning slump by regulating your child's blood sugar level.Eat and run: Nutritious two-minute mealsOrange-banana smoothie. Orange juice, low-fat yogurt, and half a banana are all you need to whip up a taste treat that's high in carbohydrates, vitamins and minerals, and calcium. Though remember to limit juice: Experts recommend that children drink no more than 1/2 to 3/4 of a cup of fruit juice a day, and half a banana plus 1/2 cup of fruit juice already meets the recommended daily intake of fruit for your preschooler, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Very berry smoothie. Blend 1/2 cup of low-fat milk with half a banana and a handful of frozen berries, which are exceptionally rich in antioxidants (substances that combat cancerous changes in cells). Add a few more berries to adjust consistency.Fruit salad. Prepare a big fruit salad on Sunday that you serve for the next couple of days. Add a dollop of yogurt to each serving for extra protein and calcium.Toaster treats. Frozen waffles take almost no time to prepare. Choose whole grain varieties for a dose of fiber, and top them with berries or sliced bananas instead of syrup. Blueberry breakfast smoothieStart your day with this delicious smoothie, packed with fruit, oats, and almonds.Ten minutes to spare: Pour on the flakesExperts say one of the healthiest breakfast options is cereal with low-fat milk. The combo is high in calcium, low in fat, and loaded with fiber (if you choose a whole grain variety). Plus, all cereals are fortified with important nutrients like folic acid, one of the B vitamins.Let your child pick the kind he likes, but steer him away from the ones that are coated with sugar. Encourage him to sweeten his cereal with sliced banana or another fruit instead. Serve with a small glass of orange juice, and the vitamin C will help his body absorb the iron in the cereal. Here are three high-fiber, low-sugar cereal superstars:Wheat or oat flakes. The breakfast of athletic heroes, cereal made from whole wheat (or oat) flake fills up your child and keeps him going. Look for varieties with at least 5 grams of fiber and no more than a few grams of sugar per serving.Grape-Nuts. With no added sugar and the goodness of whole grains, Grape-Nuts is one of the best choices on the shelf.O-shaped toasted oat cereal. These little O's have always been a hit with children. But nutritionists love them because they're made from whole grains and have as little as 1 gram of sugar per serving. (Multigrain and other varieties may have more sugar  check the label.)Instant oatmeal. A minute in the microwave is all it takes to produce a steaming bowl of nutritious high-fiber oatmeal.

Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD),https://www.babycenter.com/0_inflammatory-bowel-disease-ibd_1389867.bc,"My child may have inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). What is IBD?IBD is a disease in which parts of the intestines become inflamed and may develop ulcers, or sores. Experts don't know what causes this disease, but most likely it's at least partially inherited.Symptoms include abdominal pain, diarrhea, and constipation, as well as weight loss, fever, exhaustion, and the urge to have a bowel movement even when the bowels are empty. Because IBD causes ulcers in the intestines, there may also be blood in the stools.There are two kinds of IBD: Ulcerative colitis (UC) and Crohn's disease (CD). UC affects the inner lining of the large intestine; CD affects deeper layers of tissue, usually in the small intestine and the colon. But Crohn's can appear in any or all parts of the gastrointestinal tract, from the mouth to the anus.Current treatments can put these conditions into remission, but children with IBD may have flare-ups throughout life. That said, in general children with IBD can attend school regularly, participate in sports and activities, and lead healthy, happy lives.About a million people in the United States have IBD, and while the peak incidence is between the ages of 15 and 25 years, it can strike at any time. In fact, 25 to 30 percent of patients with CD and 20 percent of patients with UC are under the age of 20. And the number of early childhood cases has been increasing.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.How is IBD diagnosed?Your child's doctor will order some initial tests, such as stool studies and blood work. If those test results point to IBD  or if the symptoms persist  you'll be referred to a gastroenterologist.The gastroenterologist may order more blood and stool tests, and will perform an endoscopy, a colonoscopy, or both.For those procedures, a tiny tube with a camera on it (an endoscope) is passed through the mouth (for the upper gastrointestinal tract), through the anus (for the lower gastrointestinal tract) into your child's colon, or both. The doctor may also take a tissue sample from the intestines to look for signs of inflammation under a microscope. The procedure isn't painful, but kids are typically sedated.To help confirm the diagnosis and make sure no other conditions are involved, the doctor may also order imaging studies, such as X-rays, a CT scan, or an MRI of your child's abdomen.What's the treatment for IBD?Inflammatory bowel disease is often treated with a combination of medications. Steroids and drugs that suppress the immune system both reduce inflammation. Antibiotics can help heal any infections in the gastrointestinal tract.Once the inflammation and other symptoms (such as diarrhea) are gone and the intestinal lining has healed, the disease is in remission. Your child may be kept on some medications to prevent a relapse.Although no dietary change has been clearly shown to help IBD, most kids with IBD need to pay attention to their diet to help control their symptoms and maintain good nutrition. The best diet for a child depends on whether he has CD or UC, and it may involve keeping track of what he eats to identify foods that cause increased symptoms.He may also need to eat specific nutrient-rich foods and take supplements to make up for any deficiencies caused by the disease. For some children with CD, a liquid formula diet for a period of four to six weeks can help improve symptoms, maintain remission, and reverse poor weight gain and growth.The only way to ""cure"" UC is by surgically removing the entire colon. (Of course, this is considered only for severe and persistent cases. Your child may have a mild or manageable case.) There is no permanent cure for CD.The goal for both conditions is to get them into remission and keep them there.Does IBD cause other health problems?IBD can cause liver disease, gallstones, or kidney stones. It can also cause anemia because someone with intestinal ulcers can lose a lot of blood.Areas of the body outside the gastrointestinal tract (such as the joints, skin, or eyes) can develop problems. CD can also cause fistulas: tunnels of tissue that develop between sections of intestine or between the intestine and the skin, anus, or vagina. They're dangerous because they can become infected.CD can leave scars in the small intestine, creating blockages. These can interfere with the ability of your child's small intestine to absorb nutrients. For as many as 30 percent of kids with CD, this delays development and stunts their growth.UC increases the risk for colon cancer later on in life. In rare cases, a bad bout of colitis or CD can lead to a serious condition called toxic megacolon, in which the colon becomes paralyzed and can't function normally. If this happens, medications can often correct it, but if not, part of the colon has to be surgically removed.Article reviewed by Maria Olivia-Hemker, M.D., Chief of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition, Stermer Family Professor of Pediatric Inflammatory Bowel Disease at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and co-editor of Your Child With Inflammatory Bowel Disease (Johns Hopkins Press).Show sources Hide sources Johns Hopkins Children's Center. 2011.

Formula feeding: Helping your baby get used to the bottle,https://www.babycenter.com/0_formula-feeding-helping-your-baby-get-used-to-the-bottle_6421.bc,"Whether your child is a newborn just starting to formula-feed, a breastfed baby getting supplemental formula, or a baby transitioning from breast milk to formula, she'll need a little time to adjust. The first few feedings may be a little awkward, but don't worry  she'll soon get the hang of it. Read on for some ways you can make bottle feeding go smoothly.What's the best way to bottle-feed my baby?As with breastfeeding, most experts agree that you shouldn't follow a rigid schedule in the early weeks when formula feeding, though you may be able to work out an approximate pattern for feeding within a month or two. Offer the bottle every two to three hours at first, or as your baby seems hungry.Also, keep in mind that the way a baby sucks from a bottle is very different from the way she sucks from a breast because getting milk from a bottle is easier. (Some babies prefer the bottle for this reason.)Don't force more than she seems ready to eat. Until your baby weighs about 10 pounds, she'll probably take 1.5 to 3 ounces per feeding. Your baby's doctor can advise you about suitable amounts for your baby as she grows.Bottle feeding can be just as nurturing as breastfeeding, so cuddle your baby close. Some babies like to be held in a nursing position while drinking from a bottle, but others find it disconcerting. Whatever position you choose, try to maintain eye contact with your baby. (And don't feed her while she's lying on her back because she may choke.)Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.What can I do if my baby resists taking a bottle?Whatever technique you decide to use, be consistent and try it a few times, especially in the beginning. Here are a few tips:Offer your baby a bottle before he gets too hungry. You want him to be interested in food, but not so hungry that a cold nipple frustrates him. (Cold rubber or latex isn't that appealing.)Let your baby play with the nipple. If he just chews on it, let him for now. He's becoming familiar with it and may actually start sucking on it soon.Hold him in a different position. Put him in an infant car seat so he is semi-upright, and then feed him the bottle while facing him. Or try feeding him on your lap with his back to your chest. Once he's used to taking a bottle, you can hold him as you usually would for feedings.Try different temperatures. It could be that your baby prefers his milk slightly warmer or colder than you've been giving him. Experiment with different temperatures to see what he prefers.(Never use a microwave to heat a bottle of formula. A microwave heats unevenly and can create hot pockets, leading to burns. It can also cause the nutrients in formula to break down.)Let someone else introduce the bottle. If you're supplementing breastfeeding, it may help to let your partner or another caregiver give your baby the first bottle. Your baby knows your scent and associates it with breastfeeding.Offer the bottle at other times. For example, if your baby has been refusing the bottle during the day, offer it in the evening.Whichever technique you use, remember that your baby needs time to get used to new sensations, so stick with the same nipple, bottle, and feeding technique for a while before trying something different.I feel guilty for not breastfeeding. What should I do?Whatever your reason for not breastfeeding, give yourself a break. Formula feeding is a valid, healthy choice for babies. Formula even has some nutrients that breastfed babies have to get from supplements, like vitamin D.Find out more about formula feeding."
Failure to gain weight in children,https://www.babycenter.com/0_failure-to-gain-weight-in-children_11429.bc,"My child isn't gaining weight. Should I be concerned?Maybe. If your child has recently been ill, he might have lost a little weight, which he should soon put back on. If he hasn't actually lost pounds but has slowed in how quickly he's gaining weight, it might just be a normal slowing of his growth rate.Overall, however, your child should be gaining weight, not losing it. A look at his growth chart will help you evaluate your child's rate of growth in relation to other children.Of course, children grow at different rates, but if your child has consistently been in the 80th percentile for weight and has just dropped into the 10th percentile, talk with his doctor about it right away. Discuss your child's weight if you think that he's gradually dropping to a lower percentile. In general, though, a gradual drop is less cause for concern.What will the doctor do?The doctor will give your child a physical exam and ask you a number of questions to help determine whether there's a problem, and, if so, what the underlying cause might be. He'll look at many factors in addition to your child's growth rate to assess how she's doing.If your child is hitting his developmental milestones pretty much on time, relating well to you, and looking otherwise happy and healthy, she's most likely doing fine.If the doctor finds that your child isn't growing at a healthy rate, however, he may diagnose her with ""failure to gain weight"" or ""failure to thrive."" The criteria he'll use to make this diagnosis will likely include:falling below the third percentile for weight on her growth chartweighing 20 percent below the ideal weight for her heighta decrease of two or more major percentile lines on her growth chart since her last checkupIf your child isn't gaining weight, it's very important to find out why. Proper nutrition  especially during the first three years  is crucial for a child's mental and physical development.Your child's doctor may order blood, urine, or other tests and monitor your child's caloric intake for a period of time. Sometimes the answer is very simple, and sometimes it's quite complicated. He may also refer your child to a pediatric gastroenterologist, a dietitian, or a feeding specialist for evaluation or treatment.This can be a worrisome and frustrating time. It can be difficult to hear that your child isn't thriving, but it's important that you don't blame yourself or feel like you're not a good or nurturing parent.What could be causing my child's failure to gain weight?There are so many potential causes that a doctor can spend months performing tests and studying a child's diet, health history, activity level, and possible causes of stress before discovering the source of the problem.Generally, if your child isn't growing at a healthy rate, it means that he's either not eating well or not absorbing or using nutrients properly. If your child has been ill, his body may need more calories. An illness may also hurt his appetite. A chronic gastrointestinal problem such as diarrhea, reflux, celiac disease, or a milk intolerance can also cause failure to gain weight.In rare cases, failure to gain weight can be a result of a lung problem, such as cystic fibrosis; a nervous system problem, such as cerebral palsy; a chromosome problem, such as Down syndrome; heart disease; anemia; or a metabolic or an endocrine disorder, such as growth hormone deficiency. If any of these is the cause, it's important to catch it early.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.How does a doctor treat failure to gain weight?Once you and your doctor figure out what's causing the problem, you can both set about correcting it by treating any medical issues and increasing your child's caloric intake, if necessary.Upping your child's caloric intake will mean encouraging her to eat healthful, high-calorie foods whenever possible. Good choices include whole milk products (milk, cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, pudding, soup made with milk), eggs, avocados, whole-wheat breads and pastas, pancakes, mashed potatoes, nut butters, and hot cereals.Read more about your child's nutrient needs.Does failure to gain weight mean that my child will always be smaller than he should be?That depends on the underlying cause of his poor weight gain. If your child has a long-term medical condition, for example, it's possible that he may always be smaller than average. On the other hand, if the problem is easily reversed, he may catch up by growing faster than usual for a period of time.Show sources Hide sources AHRQ. 2003.

I have chronic high blood pressure. What do I need to know before I get pregnant?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_i-have-chronic-high-blood-pressure-what-do-i-need-to-know-be_10415174.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineShould I see my healthcare provider before getting pregnant?Yes. Discuss your plans to have a baby with the healthcare provider who manages your high blood pressure (hypertension). Your provider will want to review the blood pressure medications you take to control your condition.Most drugs used to treat high blood pressure haven't been shown to cause birth defects and are considered safe to take during pregnancy. But some high blood pressure medications, such as angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE inhibitors) and angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs), may raise your baby's risk of developmental problems if you take them while you're pregnant. These medications can affect a baby's kidneys or cause a low level of amniotic fluid (oligohydramnios).Untreated high blood pressure is also bad for you and your baby, so consult your provider before you stop taking your medication. Your provider can lower your dose, if possible, or switch you to a different blood pressure medicine if there's a safer option available.Your provider will also review your medical history. She'll check that your high blood pressure isn't caused by an underlying condition, and do tests to see if other organs (such as your heart, kidneys, and eyes) have been affected by high blood pressure.These tests are a good indication of your current health and give your provider a useful baseline. Comparing the results of tests you have during pregnancy with these baseline numbers helps identify any changes in your health as early as possible.Your provider can also recommend steps you can take to improve your health before you become pregnant. The more you do now to get your blood pressure to a healthy level, the better your chance of having a healthy pregnancy.What can I do to reduce blood pressure before getting pregnant?A lot! And now is the time to do it. Lifestyle changes can make a big difference in controlling high blood pressure before you become pregnant.Eat well. Make sure your diet includes plenty of whole grains, nuts, seeds, lentils, chickpeas, fresh fruits and vegetables, low-fat dairy products, lean meat, poultry, and fish low in mercury. Limit sugary and salty foods as well as red meat.Lose weight. If you're overweight, getting your body mass index (BMI) to 25 or less can also help lower your blood pressure. Losing even a small amount of weight  5 to 10 pounds  can make a big difference.Limit alcohol. That means having just 5 ounces of wine, 1.5 ounces of 80-proof distilled spirits, or 12 ounces of beer before you're pregnant. Since it's not possible to predict exactly when conception occurs, consider giving up alcohol as soon as you stop using contraception. (Stop drinking entirely once you're pregnant.)Quit smoking. If you smoke, this is a good time to give it up. Quitting will improve your health now and your baby's health when you become pregnant. Talk to your provider about how to quit.Exercise regularly. Check in with your provider first to put together a personalized plan. Any amount of exercise can have a positive effect on your health. Choose an exercise you enjoy, and try to fit in a 40-minute session most days of the week.Note: If you haven't been exercising regularly, or if your heart or other organs have been affected by high blood pressure, check with your provider before doing any intense aerobic activities. Also, talk to your provider about how your exercise regimen may change once you're pregnant.Reduce salt. Getting less sodium in your diet may lower your blood pressure. Most salt in your diet comes from processed foods.What problems could high blood pressure cause during pregnancy?Most women who have high blood pressure are able to have a normal pregnancy, but the condition does increase the risk of certain complications. The likelihood of any complication depends on the severity of your condition and whether it affects any other parts of your body, like the heart or kidneys. High blood pressure is more likely to cause complications, such as:Preeclampsia: This serious complication usually occurs late in pregnancy. Preeclampsia increases blood pressure, and severe cases can affect many organs in the body. In addition to putting a woman's health at risk, preeclampsia can also negatively impact how well the placenta delivers oxygen and nutrients to a baby.Having a small baby: High blood pressure can make a baby grow more slowly than normal (intrauterine growth restriction or IUGR).Placental abruption: In this condition, the placenta separates from the wall of the uterus, which can affect the nutrients and oxygen a baby gets. Symptoms also include bleeding and pain.Preterm birth: Having high blood pressure increases the chance of delivering a baby early (premature).Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

See all videosKeep in mind that the rule for introducing foods one at a time isn't a foolproof method for catching allergies. It's possible for babies to have an allergic reaction to a food they've eaten before with no problem. This may be especially likely if their first few exposures to the food were small amounts of it in a different food  for example, a muffin made with eggs or milk.Feed your baby the necessary fatsGrocery store shelves are bursting with low-fat and nonfat products  should babies be eating these? Absolutely not.""Fat is essential for growth. Both breast milk and formula contain a lot of it,"" says Seattle pediatrician Susanna Block.Experts recommend serving babies full-fat dairy products, such as cheese and yogurt, until age 2.Note: Don't give your baby cow's milk to drink until after her first birthday. At that point, serve whole milk (unless the doctor tells you otherwise).The unsaturated fat in avocado makes it another wonderful choice for your baby, and the same goes for salmon and other fatty fish because they contain essential fatty acids, including omega-3s.Offer rejected foods again  and againWhen it comes tosampling new foods, babies make harsh critics. Offer a mouthful of your famous pureed green beans with dill, and your baby may swallow it reluctantly  or spit it out and push your hand away, mouth clamped shut.Don't force the issue. For one thing, your baby may just not be hungry. Babies' appetites fluctuate, and they need less food than many of us think.On the other hand, your baby might be turned off by the look, smell, or taste of a food. This doesn't mean you should ban it from your table permanently.5 tips to develop healthy eating habits Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:05Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:05Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videos""Research shows that children will often begin to tolerate a new food only after they're exposed to it several times,"" says pediatrician Block.So although it can be frustrating to watch your baby reject the food you've lovingly prepared, take a deep breath and try again another day.Limit junk foodEveryone knows that junk food is unhealthy, but the negative effects can be much more serious for babies. (Unfortunately, some classic kid foods actually qualify as junk. See our list of theworst foods for babies.)That's because even a very small serving of sugary or salty junk food is likely to make your baby feel full, leaving less room for healthier food with the nutrients necessary for brain growth and development.""Babies' calorie needs are relatively low, but their nutrient needs are high,"" says physician and dietitian Christine Gerbstadt. ""Insufficient nutrition can even affect [when your baby reaches]milestones.""Does this mean you're a bad parent if you let your little one sample a french fry or gnaw on a corner of your chocolate chip cookie once in a while? No  just don't make it a regular habit because it could encourage your baby to develop a taste for sugary or salty foods.Be aware of choking hazardsChoking is still a danger, so this more relaxed attitude aboutfeedingbabies definitely doesn't extend to food size and consistency.Mash or puree your baby's food, and keep in mind that eating is like any other milestone  babies reach it at different times. Some babies will be ready for thicker, lumpier purees before others.""If you notice your baby coughing on the thicker puree, it may mean he's not ready to handle it yet. Take it away and step back down to the thinner puree for a while,"" says Block. If the problem persists, talk to your child's doctor.As your baby progresses tofinger foods, you'll no longer need to puree everything, but just be sure to cut food into small pieces no larger than 1/2 inch. And don't give your baby choking hazards, such as hot dogs, nuts, chunks of raw vegetables, and popcorn. See morefoods that can be unsafefor your baby or toddler.Demonstrate the joy of eating""Dining with one's friends and beloved family is certainly one of life's primal and most innocent delights,"" Julia Child famously said.Enjoying your food is the most meaningful thing you can do to foster a similar appreciation in your little one. Babies watch their parents and model them, so experiment with different flavors and new foods. Let your baby see you eating and savoring lots of different healthy foods. If you enjoy the simple pleasure of eating good food, chances are your baby will too.Unfortunately, it's also easy to become frustrated and stressed about your baby's eating habits. Her fickle appetite, your concern about whether she's eating enough, and the sheer messiness can conspire to turn feeding time into a chore  or even an outright battle.It doesn't have to be this way. There are several things you can do to make mealtime an enjoyable experience. First, make sure you have enough time so that you aren't hurrying your baby's meals. And hard as it is, accept the mess as a given  letting babies play with their food is actually good for them.""Young children who are learning to eat should be allowed to make messes. While playing they're actually learning about new tastes and smells and how to get food into their mouth,"" says dietitian Eileen Behan. ""Most important, they're learning that eating can be pleasant and enjoyable.""To make cleaning up easier, put a splat mat under your baby's highchair. On warm days, consider letting your baby dine topless to lighten your laundry load. And take comfort in knowing that everything is washable, including your baby.Show sources Hide sources AAAI. 2013.

8 things nutritionists wish you'd do during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-food-diary,"Between exhaustion, ""morning"" sickness, and ravenous hunger, pregnancy can make it a challenge to eat right. But growing babies rely on their mom for sustenance, so you'll want to make good choices about what goes into your mouth  and into your womb. Read on to discover the eight most important things nutritionists recommend for healthy eating and weight gain during pregnancy.1. Find out how much you should gain""Know your numbers,"" says Jessica Corwin, a registered dietitian and community nutrition educator for Spectrum Health in Michigan. ""We should gain different amounts of weight based on our individual BMI. It's helpful to ask your doctor how much you should be gaining.""Guidelines call for women who begin pregnancy at a healthy weight to put on between 25 to 35 pounds. Women who are underweight or having twins or multiples are advised to gain more, while women who are overweight or obese should gain less. Get the details on how much weight you should gain during pregnancy and why.Those extra pounds are critical for your baby's growth and development. But with a typical baby weighing 7.5 pounds, what's all the rest of the weight for?Here's a breakdown: An expectant mom's breasts add up to 2 additional pounds as they swell in preparation to feed the baby. The placenta and growing uterus add another 4 pounds. Factor in the extra blood flowing through your body  up to 3.5 pounds, which explains why a pregnant woman's iron needs are so high  and 6 to 8 pounds of amniotic fluid and other fluids, and you're starting to feel heavy. Plus, your body will need up to 9 more pounds of fat to use as energy reserves during pregnancy and lactation.2. Exercise regularlyDon't assume that pregnancy is a good time to suspend your gym membership. It's important to remain physically active for your own health and that of your baby. Hitting the treadmill or attending pregnancy yoga keeps your body strong, can help prevent gestational diabetes, and can help you avoid gaining too much weight, which can lead to a too-big baby. Regular exercise also prepares you for the ultimate workout: labor and delivery.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant women (who have received their provider's approval to work out) exercise moderately for at least 20 to 30 minutes on most, if not all, days of the week. Unfortunately, many moms-to-be aren't exercising this much.""A lot of my patients tell me they're not active at all,"" says Eleana Kaidanian, a New York registered dietitian who counsels pregnant women.Kaidanian recommends fitting in exercise whenever and however you can. ""Even if it's just 10 minutes of walking around your apartment after each meal, that's 30 minutes you weren't doing before.""3. Drink waterThe Institute of Medicine recommends that pregnant women drink 10 8-ounce glasses of water or other beverages each day. (If it's warm out or you're exercising, drink even more.)When Kaidanian asks her pregnant patients what they drink when they're thirsty, more often than not, they list soda, juice, or coffee. However, it's best to keep caffeine and sugar to a minimum during your pregnancy. (Even 100 percent fruit juice contains a lot of natural sugars.)""Water is the best source of hydration,"" says Kaidanian. If you're not tracking your fluid ounces, just tote a water bottle with you wherever you go and sip throughout the day until your urine is clear or pale yellow in color  a sign of proper hydration.If plain water isn't appealing  or is even nauseating  try sparkling water with various flavors (like lemon, orange, and berry) or water with a squeeze of lemon. Or make spa water: Keep a pitcher of tap water in the fridge and add cut oranges, apples, or other fruit to infuse it with subtle flavor.4. Be diligent about prenatal vitaminsI forgot. It's too big. I don't like it.Kaidanian hears a lot of reasons for skipping a daily prenatal vitamin and accepts none of them. Just take yours, she says, because prenatal vitamins are a nearly effortless way to ensure you and your baby are getting the nutrients you need. Many women's diets are deficient in vitamin D and iron as well as folic acid, which is critical in the prevention of neural tube defects such as spina bifida.""It's hard to meet your nutrient intake every day for every single nutrient unless you're planning out specifically what you need for your body, and most people are not doing that,"" says Kaidanian. ""They make so many kinds of prenatal vitamins now  chewables, gummies, and even mini vitamins for those who find them hard to swallow  there's really no excuse.""5. Avoid gaining too muchGaining too much weight during pregnancy increases your risk for gestational diabetes and birth complications such as c-section delivery and tearing.Excess weight gain can lead to a larger baby, which can make for a harder delivery, says Daniel Roshan, a maternal-fetal medicine specialist in New York City and an assistant professor at New York University.""We try to keep our c-section rate down, so we really emphasize diet,"" says Roshan. If an expecting mom is eating unhealthily, he says, ""it's like the baby is sitting around having chocolate all day. He gets chubby. When it comes time for delivery, it's harder for him to come out, so there's a bigger chance of complications.""6. Eat small mealsWhen you're nauseated, the thought of a large meal can really turn your stomach. And later in pregnancy, as your baby crowds your stomach and other digestive organs, eating even a fairly modest amount of food at one time can be uncomfortable.Feel free to focus on eating frequent mini-meals. ""Eating small meals often helps because it constantly keeps a little bit of something in your stomach and keeps your blood sugar even,"" says Ashley Roman, director of the New York University Maternal Fetal Care Center.7. Snack smartStock your kitchen with healthy staples so you can easily grab good-for-you snacks. Wash fresh fruit ahead of time and keep portioned bags of trail mix in your desk at work. String cheese and whole grain crackers are satisfying too. Try whipping up a batch of smoothie over the weekend, then freezing it in individual jars.At night, stick a jar in the fridge to defrost. Come morning, add some wheat germ or flax seed and call it breakfast.""Every bite when you're pregnant is impacting your baby, so if you can include nutrition, you'll feel better about snacking,"" says dietitian Jessica Corwin.8. Learn to substituteIt's fine to give into your food cravings in moderation, but it's smart to give them healthier tweaks  especially if they're becoming frequent items on your menu.For example, if you regularly yearn for pizza, follow Ellie Krieger's lead and make pizza on a whole-grain English muffin with part-skim cheese, tomato sauce, and spinach. ""I craved pizza constantly,"" says Krieger, who hosted Food Network's Healthy Appetite and is the author of Weeknight Wonders. ""That hit the spot without going all out and having a big, greasy slice each day.""Craving chocolate? Krieger suggests stirring a tablespoon of cocoa powder and a bit of sugar into a glass of warm, low-fat milk. ""You get the antioxidant bonus from the cocoa and calcium from the milk, it's the perfect snack size  about 200 calories, and it's filling.""Bonnie Rochman is a health writer who is at work on a book about how genetics is reshaping childhood.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015a.

Nutrition guidelines for young children (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_nutrition-guidelines-for-young-children-ages-5-to-8_66921.bc,"Most school-aged children develop curiosity about food and new eating habits as they grow. While certain foods are essential, every child has unique dietary needs and preferences. To make sure your child gets enough of all the right stuff, see these tips for healthy snacks and meals, and follow the guidelines below.Nutrition for big kidsOffer your child foods from all five major food groups (grains, fruits, vegetables, dairy, and protein) at every meal. You may not always be able to get him to eat the recommended amount from each group every day, but if you serve a variety of healthy food, he'll eventually get what he needs over the course of a week.GrainsGrains contain fiber, which aids digestion, and complex carbohydrates, which provide energy. Grains are also great sources of B vitamins, and some fortified ready-to-eat cereals provide an entire day's worth of many vitamins and minerals.Grains come in two types  whole grains and refined grains. Whole grain products use the entire grain kernel and have more fiber, iron and B vitamins than refined grains. Examples of whole grains are whole wheat flour and bread, bulgur, oatmeal, whole cornmeal, brown rice, and whole wheat pasta.Refined grains have been processed to give them a finer texture and a longer shelf life. Refined grain products include white flour and bread, white rice, and most kinds of pasta.Some foods are made from both whole grains and refined grains.The USDA recommends getting at least half of your grains from whole grains.How much big kids need daily: About five ounce equivalents.How much is in an ounce of grains: An ounce of grains equals one slice of bread, 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal, or 1/2 cup of cooked pasta or cooked cereal.Examples of the daily requirement:1 cup oatmeal for breakfast, whole wheat bread sandwich for lunch, 1/2 cup brown rice for dinner.One whole grain mini bagel for breakfast, five whole wheat crackers for a snack, open faced sandwich for lunch, English muffin pizza for dinner.One whole wheat pancake for breakfast, two rye crispbreads for a snack, grilled cheese sandwich for lunch, 1/2 cup cooked bulgur for dinner.VegetablesVegetables provide plenty of fiber, along with vitamins C and A and potassium. In addition, most produce contains antioxidants, disease-fighting substances that may lower the risk of cancer and heart disease later in life.Over the course of a week, try to serve your child lots of different-colored vegetables  dark green broccoli, light green beans, orange carrots, red tomatoes, and so on. That way, you'll be sure he's getting all the nutrients each vegetable has to offer.How much big kids need daily: About 1 1/2 cups.How much is in a cup of vegetables: A cup of vegetables equals 1 cup of cooked or raw vegetables, 2 cups of raw leafy greens, one large tomato, or two medium carrots.Examples of your the daily requirement:1 cup chopped salad greens with 1/4 cup sliced cherry tomatoes for lunch, 1/4 cup cauliflower and 1/4 cup of broccoli trees for snack, and 1/4 cup cooked corn for dinner.1/2 cup low-sodium tomato juice for breakfast, one half baked sweet potato for lunch, and 1/2 cup cooked broccoli trees for dinner.1/2 cup cooked squash for lunch, one half small ear of corn on the cob for lunch, 1/2 cup cooked baby spinach for dinner. FruitFruit also provides plenty of fiber, along with vitamins C and A and potassium. In addition, most produce contains antioxidants, disease-fighting substances that may lower the risk of cancer and heart disease later in life.Serve your child a colorful variety of fruits to be sure he gets as many different nutrients as possible.How much big kids need daily: About 1 to 1 1/2 cups.How much is in a cup of fruit: A cup of fruit equals 1 cup of fresh, frozen, or canned fruit; 1/2 cup dried fruit; one half of a large apple; one 8-inch or 9-inch banana; one medium (4-inch diameter) grapefruit.Examples of the daily requirement:1/2 cup sliced banana for breakfast, 1/4 cup raisins for snack, 1/2 cup sliced strawberries for dessert.Half an apple (sliced) for snack, a quarter of an orange (sectioned) for lunch, 1/4 cup canned peaches for dessert.Half a grapefruit for breakfast, 1/2 cup applesauce for lunch, 1/2 cup sliced berries for dessert.DairyMost dairy products are wonderful sources of calcium, which gives your child strong teeth and bones. They're also excellent sources of protein  good to know if your child doesn't like meat.Once your child is older than 2, make the switch to low-fat or fat-free milk. Your child gets the same amount of calcium and vitamin D, but less solid fat and fewer calories.Solid fats are mainly saturated fat, which raise blood cholesterol levels. Do your child a favor by getting him in the habit of drinking low-fat milk as a youngster.How much big kids need daily: About 2 1/2 cups.How much is in a cup of dairy: A cup of dairy can be 1 cup milk, yogurt, or soy milk; 1 1/2 ounces, two slices, or 1/3 cup shredded hard cheese (such as cheddar, mozzarella, Swiss, or Parmesan); 2 ounces processed (American) cheese; 1/2 cup ricotta cheese; 2 cups cottage cheese; 1 cup pudding made with milk; or 1 1/2 cups ice cream.Examples of the daily requirement:1/2 cup milk for breakfast, 1/2 cup yogurt for snack, 1/2 cup milk and one slice cheddar cheese for lunch, 1/2 cup pudding for dessert.1/2 cup milk for breakfast, one slice cheese for snack, 1/2 cup milk for lunch, 1/3 cup shredded Parmesan cheese for dinner.1/3 cup shredded cheddar cheese (in eggs or on toast) for breakfast, 1/2 cup milk for lunch, 1/2 cup milk for dinner, 1/2 cup frozen yogurt for dessert. ProteinMeat, poultry, seafood, beans and peas, eggs, soy products, and nuts and seeds are all protein foods. (Beans and peas are also part of the vegetable food group.) Unless you're raising your child to be vegetarian, try to serve seafood at least twice a week.Choose lean or low-fat meat and poultry, and remove skin from chicken before cooking. Protein foods give your child iron, zinc, and some B vitamins.How much big kids need daily: About four ounce equivalents.How much is in an ounce of protein: An ounce equivalent of protein equals 1 ounce of meat, fish, or poultry; one egg; 1 tablespoon of nut butter; 1/4 cup of cooked beans; 1/8 cup of tofu; and 1/2 ounce of nuts or seeds.Examples of the daily requirement:One egg for breakfast, 1 ounce sliced turkey for lunch, 1 ounce cooked ground beef, and 1/4 cup chili beans for dinner.1/4 cup tofu scramble for breakfast, 1 tablespoon peanut butter for lunch, 1/4 cup refried beans for dinner.1 tablespoon nut butter for breakfast, one egg for lunch, 1 ounce roast beef and 1/4 cup cooked lentils for dinner.Oils and fats: Use sparinglyOils aren't considered a separate food group, but they do provide some nutrients necessary for a healthy diet, and they are the major source of vitamin E in the typical American diet. Still, only small amounts of oils are necessary.Oils are fats that are liquid at room temperature, like the vegetable oils used in cooking or salad dressings. Some foods, such as nuts, certain fish, avocados, and olives, are naturally high in oils. (Two tablespoons of peanut butter contain 2 teaspoons of oil.)Most children get all the oils they need in the food they eat or in salad dressings or oils used for cooking. Children 5 to 8 years old need about 4 teaspoons of oil a day."
Meal planning during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_meal-planning-during-pregnancy_1352495.bc,"It's easy to feel overwhelmed by pregnancy nutrition advice and worry that your diet will never measure up. But eating well when you're pregnant doesn't need to be difficult: A few simple, online tools can help you make sure you're getting the nutrients you and your baby need.Here's a look at general nutrition guidelines and how you can use them to plan meals during your pregnancy.MyPlateYou may remember the Food Guide Pyramid from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA), which outlined how many daily servings you should eat from different categories of food. That pyramid has been adapted to become MyPlate, a system for choosing healthy food based on the USDA's Dietary Guidelines for Americans.The site even has a section onhealth and nutrition for pregnant and breastfeeding women, featuring a personalized tracking system that suggests meal plans based on your age, height, pre-pregnancy weight, activity level, and trimester.MyPlate divides food into five main groups  grains, fruit, vegetables, protein, and dairy  plus oils. To get an individualized meal plan with general guidelines on what to choose from each group, enter your information at ChooseMyPlate.gov.A sample MyPlate planHere's a quick look at the MyPlate food groups and what a customized plan might recommend.This sample plan is designed for a 32-year-old woman who is 5 feet 4 inches tall, weighed 130 pounds before she got pregnant, is in her second trimester, and gets less than 30 minutes of daily physical activity. (Of course, your plan may be very different.)Grains: 7 ounces a dayGenerally, an ounce of grains equals one slice of bread, one small corn or flour tortilla, 1 cup of ready-to-eat cereal, or 1/2 cup of cooked cereal, rice, or pasta. Get at least half of your daily grains from whole grains (like whole wheat bread or brown rice). Whole grains contain the most fiber, vitamins, and nutrients.Fruits: 2 cups a dayVary the color of the fruit you eat, and choose fresh over frozen or canned whenever possible. Many packaged varieties are preserved in sugary liquid, so choose products without added sugar.Bonus: The fiber in fruit helps prevent hemorrhoidsandconstipation, two common side effects of pregnancy.Vegetables: 3 cups a dayFresh vegetables taste better than canned or frozen, and they're also a better choice if you want to limit sodium and avoid preservatives. But when it comes to fiber and vitamins, plain canned and frozen veggies are just as nutritious as fresh. For maximum nutrition, vary the color of the vegetables you choose. Broccoli, for example, is packed with folate, calcium, and B vitamins. Sweet potatoes provide vitamin A, vitamin C, and fiber.Meat and beans: 6 ounces a dayThis equals about two servings that are each about the size of a deck of cards. Choose lean meat and limitfishto 12 ounces per week. (More than that may expose your baby to potentially harmful levels of mercury.)Dairy: 3 cups a dayIn the MyPlate plan, 1 cup of dairy equals 1 cup of milk or yogurt, 1 1/2 ounces of natural cheese, and 2 ounces of processed cheese. In general, dairy products are a great source of calcium and protein.Fats and oils: 6 teaspoons a dayThe best sources include canola oil, olive oil, safflower oil, fatty fish, avocados, nuts, seeds, and olives. Note: An avocado is a fruit, but it's included in the oils category because most of its calories come from fat.Discretionary calories: 266 a dayThis MyPlate sample plan budgets 266 ""extra"" calories that you use how you like, but you must include them in your daily calorie budget. In other words, you could have a scoop of ice cream or put some sugar in your decaf iced tea, but these discretionary calories count toward your daily total (2,200 in this case). How it all adds upOnce you've created your daily food plan, don't try to hit exact numbers in each category. Instead, shoot for an average that's in the desired range over the course of a week or so.As your pregnancy progresses, you'll need to eat a little more because your nutrition needs changeduring the different stages of pregnancy.If you eat roughly the amount recommended for each food group, take a prenatal vitamin daily, and consistently gain a reasonable amount of weight (about a pound per week in the second and third trimesters), you and your baby will be well nourished.The Harvard Healthy Eating PlateNot everyone agrees that the USDA's MyPlate is the best model for good nutrition. Researchers at the Harvard School of Public Health have created their own eating guide, called theHealthy Eating Plate, which they believe better reflects current research on a balanced diet.The Harvard Healthy Eating Plate puts greater emphasis on whole grain foods, recommends healthy vegetable oils, and encourages limiting milk and dairy products to one or two servings a day. It also suggests limiting red meat (and avoiding processed meat altogether) and refined grains, such as white bread and white rice.The Healthy Eating Plate also encourages drinking plenty of water and skipping sugary drinks, and highlights the importance of daily exercise.Harvard's plan encourages you to eat more vegetables because most Americans don't eat enough from this important food group. One exception: Unlike the USDA's MyPlate, the Healthy Eating Plate does not include potatoes in its list of recommended vegetables. That's because potatoes are full of rapidly digested starch and have the same effect on blood sugar as sweets.Which model is best to follow during pregnancy?You can't go wrong with either version. Because experts don't completely agree, you can expect to find slight variations in their recommendations, but the two plans have plenty in common.Even if you can't follow either program to the letter, each gives you something to strive for, says Alan R. Fleischman, neonatologist and medical director of the March of Dimes. Eating nutritiously during pregnancy can pay huge dividends for the rest of your baby's life.""We know that some simple dietary changes can greatly improve the chances of having a healthy baby. For example, consuming 400 micrograms of the B vitaminfolic acidevery day before pregnancy begins and during early pregnancy significantly reduces the risk of a serious birth defect of the brain and spine,"" says Fleischman. ""Poor nutrition during pregnancy has lifelong effects on the growth and development of your baby. It's more important to eat wisely during pregnancy than practically any other time in life.""Do these food guidelines always apply?There are five exceptions to the guidelines. If any of these apply to you, or if you have other concerns, talk to your healthcare provider about your personal nutritional needs.If you're significantlyoverweight, you might do better with fewer calories, but talk to your provider to make sure you're getting the nutrients your baby needs.If you're significantlyunderweight, you'll need to get more calories.If you're a teenager, you'll also need more.If you're expectingmultiples, you'll have additional nutrition needs.If you developgestational diabetesor have pre-existing diabetes, a registered dietitian can help you plan your diet. It will emphasize eating whole foods and getting a consistent amount of carbohydrates at each meal. You'll also need to monitor your blood sugar levels closely and communicate regularly with your team of healthcare providers.Sample menu for a pregnant womanHere's an example of a daily menu specifically designed for our ""sample mom,"" with a few extra snack suggestions.

How to get your grade-schooler to eat more healthy food,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-get-your-grade-schooler-to-eat-more-healthy-food_1383895.bc,"Eating well gives your child the energy he needs to learn and grow. And it'll help him stay healthy, maintain a healthy weight, and establish good lifelong eating habits. Here are some ways to make nutritious food the most appealing choice:Get your grade-schooler involvedA great way to get your child excited about eating a range of healthy foods is to involve him in the family's meal-planning decisions. Let him help you make out menus and a grocery list. Have him check to see whether you're out of grapes and suggest favorite suppers and what to pack for his lunchbox.When you take him food shopping, ask him to check items off the grocery list for you as you shop. Give him a few choices to make along the way: Peaches or mangoes? Peas or carrots? Graham crackers or fig bars?You can even have your child look for specific ingredients, like sugar, on the nutrition labels of the foods you choose  and those you put back on the shelf.Make a habit of selecting one new fruit or vegetable to try each week, keeping in mind that your child may not be interested in trying something unfamiliar until it's been offered numerous times.To encourage your child to take some responsibility for his own nutrition, you could help him create his own daily food chart, with boxes for each category: fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy, and meat/protein. (Check out the United States Department of Agriculture's ready-made chart to get started.)Have your child color in or check off the appropriate boxes when he finishes a meal or snack. Then look at the chart together at the end of each day to tally how well he did in meeting his nutritional goals.Encourage involvement in the kitchenTeach your grade-schooler to follow a simple recipe and measure ingredients. (This is excellent hands-on practice for learning fractions!)Have your child wash the lettuce and toss the salad, grease the baking pans and fill the muffin tins. Let him have some fun pouring pancakes in the shape of his initials or cutting toast into a heart shape.Once he's old enough to handle it, have him grate cheese and even chop fruits and vegetables. (Always supervise your child with knives and electric appliances, of course.) Go to the sourceTake your grade-schooler on an outing to an orchard, berry farm, or dairy so he can see where the food on his plate comes from. The novelty just might inspire him to try something he wouldn't otherwise be interested in.There's nothing like seeing your own food grow to motivate kids to eat their fruits and veggies. Think about planting your own. Even if you don't have much space, you can grow tomatoes or strawberries in a container on a balcony or patio.Be picky about juicesFruit juices count toward your child's daily fruit intake, but be careful about the kind and amount of juice you offer. Serve your grade-schooler only 100 percent fruit juice or fruit-vegetable juice combinations. (These are full of nutrients and contain less natural sugar than many fruit juices.) Some kids even enjoy vegetable juices straight up!If your child won't drink milk, you may want to find juices that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D, but don't offer fruit ""drinks"" because they may contain as little as 10 percent juice and an array of flavorings and sweeteners.Keep in mind that even the healthiest fruit juices can easily become too much of a good thing. Juice can contribute to childhood obesity and malnourishment because a child who drinks a great deal of juice gets extra calories and, at the same time, not all the nutrients he needs. Constantly sipping juice can also lead to tooth decay.So limit your child to 4 to 6 ounces of fruit juice per day through age 6, and keep it under 8 to 12 ounces per day starting at age 7. Then use fresh fruit to meet the rest of his daily requirement. When he's thirsty, encourage him to drink water. (You can also water down your child's juice, half and half, for the flavor of juice with fewer extra calories.)Shake and bakeSmoothies are an easy way to get fruit and other nutritious foods into your child's diet. All you need is a blender and a few simple ingredients. You can use your choice of fresh fruit, frozen fruit such as berries or bananas (peel before freezing), or even canned pineapple or peaches (strain the syrup first).You might want to include tofu or hard-cooked egg whites  they add protein without changing the taste or texture  and a bit of ground flax seed for extra fiber and omega 3s. Blend with fruit juice or add milk, yogurt, or frozen yogurt for a creamier drink and a dose of calcium.Whole wheat and bran muffins and quick breads are a good source of grains and fiber, and they can also be a vehicle for fruits and vegetables. Make or buy them with bananas, blueberries, carrots, pineapple, or zucchini. Fortify but don't foolYou might try incorporating healthy foods into dishes you know your grade-schooler likes, but don't be sneaky about it. (Even if he falls for it now, he may later feel betrayed when he figures out what's up.)Tell him that you're giving him some special pasta spirals tonight  with spinach mixed in or with broccoli and cheese on top. Better to be up-front and encourage an adventurous approach to eating.Make it countBe aware of your grade-schooler's nutritional needs, but remember that eating right isn't all about fruits and vegetables. Calcium is especially important during adolescence, when bones are growing rapidly. Three servings of calcium-rich foods per day are needed. Here are some easy ways to serve up good nutrition:A peanut butter sandwich (1 1/2 tablespoons on two slices of whole wheat bread) and one cup of low-fat milk will take care of about a third of your child's recommended daily intake of grain and half of his dairy requirements. It will also provide all of his protein for the day, as well as important nutrients like zinc, vitamin E, magnesium, and essential fatty acids.One and a half cups of bran cereal with raisins with one cup of low-fat milk and a 4-ounce glass of orange juice will satisfy about a third of his fruit, half of his dairy, and a third of his grains for the day. It'll also provide fiber, iron, calcium, and vitamin C.Even a slice of cheese pizza equals almost a third of the day's dairy, providing over half of the day's protein and healthy doses of vitamin A, zinc, and iron.Find fast-food alternativesMost fast food is full of fat, sugar, salt, and excess calories. An occasional fast-food burger and fries won't cause any harm, but if you have an alternative, take it. Teach your child to select from the healthy options on the menu  yes to the grilled chicken sandwich, no to the fried onion rings, and forget about super-sizing the meal!Or pick and choose: Have the burger, but choose fruit or low-fat granola instead of fries. Do your best to limit these kinds of meals to no more than once a week.Be a good role modelAs you consider all the ways of getting your grade-schooler to eat well, remember to practice what you preach. If your child sees you eating lots of junk food or skipping meals, you can't expect him to eat properly. Make an effort to eat whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and you and your child will both be better off.Be upbeatForget the food fights. Let your child decide how much he wants to eat. And don't use a sweet treat as a bribe or withhold it as a punishment.Try to make mealtime together  at the table, not in front of the television  as enjoyable as possible, so that your child can establish a good, healthy relationship with food.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2001.

Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR),https://www.babycenter.com/0_intrauterine-growth-restriction-iugr_1427406.bc,"What is intrauterine growth restriction?Babies are diagnosed with intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) if they appear to be smaller than expected  specifically, if an ultrasound indicates that their weight is below the 10th percentile for their gestational age.There are lots of reasons that a baby appears small. In many cases, a baby who's diagnosed with IUGR just happens to be small (perhaps like one of his parents). In other cases, a baby who seems small in the womb turns out to be a normal size at birth. But in some cases, something is keeping the baby from growing properly, and the prenatal caregiver will try to figure out what the problem is.How can my caregiver tell how big my baby is?Your caregiver assesses the size of your uterus during a pelvic exam in your first trimester. After that, she checks your baby's growth by measuring your belly at every prenatal visit. If the measurement is smaller than your due date indicates it should be (this is called ""small for dates""), she'll follow up with an ultrasound to pinpoint your baby's size and weight.If you're in the first half of pregnancy and this is your first ultrasound, you may measure small because your due date (based on your last period) is wrong. This can happen if you remembered the first day of your last period incorrectly or ovulated later than usual in your last cycle.If the ultrasound confirms your due date, however, you'll have another ultrasound in several weeks to check on your baby's growth. If the second ultrasound indicates that it's lagging, your baby may be diagnosed with IUGR.What could be causing problems with my baby's growth?A baby may not be growing properly if he's not getting the oxygen and nutrients he needs to thrive. Less commonly, a genetic defect interferes with his growth. Here's a list of the most common causes of IUGR:Abnormalities in the placenta, the organ that delivers oxygen and nutrients to your baby in the womb. The placenta may not be functioning properly if it's too small, improperly formed, or starting to detach from the uterus (placental abruption). A placenta that's too low in the uterus (placenta previa) may slightly increase the risk of IUGR.Medical conditions you may have, such as chronic hypertension or preeclampsia (particularly if the preeclampsia is severe and diagnosed in your second trimester or if you have both chronic hypertension and preeclampsia), kidney or heart disease, certain anemias (like sickle cell disease), advanced diabetes, blood clotting disorders, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, or serious lung disease.Chromosomal abnormalities, such as Down syndrome, or structural birth defects, such as anencephaly (in which part of the brain is missing) or defects in the kidneys or abdominal wall.Carrying twins or higher multiples.Smoking, drinking, or abusing drugs.Certain infections your baby may get from you, such as toxoplasmosis, CMV, syphilis, or rubella.Certain medications, such as some anticonvulsants.Severe malnutrition.In addition, women who are underweight before pregnancy and don't gain enough weight gain during pregnancy, and women who live at very high altitudes, are more likely to have somewhat smaller babies.If you have any of the conditions listed above, you'll have ultrasounds to check your baby's growth, even if your belly measurements during your prenatal visits are normal.Also, if you've previously had a stillbirth or a baby with IUGR, you can expect at least one ultrasound in your late second or early third trimester to check on your baby's growth. Finally, your caregiver may suspect IUGR and check your baby's growth by ultrasound if your multiple marker test shows an elevated level of AFP in your blood for which there's no apparent reason. How can IUGR affect my baby's health?Babies diagnosed with IUGR are more likely to have certain complications during pregnancy, during delivery, and afterward. The degree of risk depends on what caused the growth problem in the first place, how severe the growth restriction is, how early in pregnancy it starts, and the baby's gestational age at birth.Research suggests that a baby whose weight is below the 5th percentile  especially if it's below the 3rd percentile  is much more likely to have problems. And the risk of both short-term and long-term complications is higher for growth-restricted babies who are also born prematurely.Growth-restricted babies may have lower levels of oxygen and nutrients in the womb and at birth, and are at higher risk of being stillborn. They may have a more difficult time tolerating labor, so c-sections are more common.And at birth they're also more likely to have low blood sugar, lower resistance to infection, trouble maintaining their body temperature, and an abnormally high red blood cell count. They're also more prone to jaundice and to meconium aspiration (when the baby inhales his own stool in the womb or during delivery).How a growth-restricted baby will do in the long run depends partly on what caused the growth problem in the first place. Most growth-restricted babies who are otherwise normal do eventually catch up with their peers, although some  particularly those born prematurely  have developmental problems.For example, IUGR has been linked with cerebral palsy. Finally, some research suggests that growth-restricted babies are more likely to become obese later in life and develop heart disease, type II diabetes, and high blood pressure.What will happen if my baby has IUGR?First, you'll have a detailed ultrasound, in part to check your baby's anatomy and see if he has structural defects that may be responsible for his lagging growth. You may also be offered an amniocentesis check for chromosomal abnormalities, particularly if structural defects were found on an ultrasound or the growth restriction appears severe or was found early in your pregnancy.Depending on your situation, your caregiver may suggest blood tests or an amniocentesis to see if an infection or problems with blood clotting are the culprit. And you'll be watched carefully for signs of preeclampsia.Whatever the cause of the IUGR, you'll have an ultrasound every two to four weeks to check your baby's size and rate of growth since the last ultrasound, and to estimate the amount of amniotic fluid in your womb. Your baby will also be monitored with nonstress tests, biophysical profiles, and Doppler ultrasounds (to check blood flow to and from your baby).Your caregiver may also ask you to do ""fetal kick counts"" to keep track of your baby's movements. This is a good way for you to monitor your baby's well-being between prenatal appointments.Generally, if you're at or near term (37 weeks), you'll be induced or have a c-section (if your baby can't tolerate the stress of labor or you shouldn't deliver vaginally for other reasons). If you're not near term, what happens will depend on how you and your baby are doing. If your baby isn't doing well or you're very sick  with severe preeclampsia, for example  you may have to deliver early.Is there anything I can do to help my baby be born healthy?Be sure to keep all your prenatal and fetal testing appointments. If you were planning to deliver at a small community hospital, you may need to transfer to a larger hospital with a neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) that can better handle any problems that might crop up.And if you smoke, drink alcohol, or use drugs, you'll have to give up those activities if you haven't already. (Don't be shy about asking your caregiver to direct you to a program for help.) If you've gained less than the recommended amount of weight, your caregiver will advise you to eat well and get more calories. And you'll probably need to abstain from aerobic exercise for the rest of your pregnancy.Some caregivers will prescribe bedrest, but there's no evidence that it helps. Only one small, well-designed study to date has looked at the effect of bedrest on intrauterine growth restriction, and it found that bedrest didn't seem to help.Show sources Hide sources APA. 2007.

Your pregnancy diet: The basics of eating well,https://www.babycenter.com/pregnancy-eating-well,"Fine-tune your diet  even if you already eat wellAlmost all pregnant women need to get more protein, more of certain vitamins and minerals (such as folic acid and iron), and more calories (for energy). If there's room for improvement in your diet, eating highly nutritious meals is one of the best things you can do for your baby's health.But eating better doesn't mean eating a lot. If you start off at a healthy weight, you don't need additional calories during the first trimester. In the second trimester, you need about 340 extra calories a day and about 450 extra calories a day in the third trimester. If you're underweight or overweight to start, you'll need more or less than this, depending on your weight gain goal.Learn more: Find out the best ways to eat for two and get the calories you need.Skip unsafe foodsSome foods can be dangerous when you're pregnant. Steer clear of these foods:Raw seafood (such as oysters or uncooked sushi)Unpasteurized milk (and cheese made from unpasteurized milk)Soft cheese (such as Brie or Camembert)Mexican cheese (like queso blanco and panela)PtRaw or undercooked meat and poultryAll of these are possible sources of bacteria that can be harmful to an unborn child.Learn more: Find out how to avoid listeriosis, a foodborne illness that's especially dangerous during pregnancy. Pregnancy weight gain trackerSee your target weight range for pregnancy and whether your weight gain is on track.Say no to alcoholYou'll need to give up cocktails, too. Drinking alcohol during pregnancy can cause physical defects, learning disabilities, and emotional problems in children, so many experts recommend that you give up alcohol for your entire pregnancy.Learn more: Discover your favorite nonalcoholic alternative from our list of the best virgin drinks.Limit caffeineCaffeine is another consideration. Aim to get less than 200 milligrams (mg) per day (about 12 ounces of coffee). Some studies suggest a link between higher amounts of caffeine and miscarriage or lower birth weight, but this hasn't been confirmed. Just in case, stick to decaffeinated tea and sodas, or choose healthier drinks, such as skim milk, 100 percent fruit juice, or water with a squeeze of lemon.Learn more: Be informed about caffeine during pregnancy and see how much caffeine there is in common beverages and foods.Go easy on fishNearly all fish contain traces of methylmercury, a metal believed to be harmful in high doses to the growing brains of fetuses and young children. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration recommends limiting your consumption of fish to 12 ounces a week, which is the equivalent of about two servings.Learn more: Get the facts about eating fish during pregnancy and find answers to all your food safety questions.Take a prenatal vitaminEven without morning sickness or food aversions, it's difficult to meet your nutritional needs with just a well-balanced diet. A prenatal vitamin-mineral supplement helps you get the nutrients you and your baby need to thrive.Make sure the prenatal vitamin you choose contains folic acid. (You need 400 mcg daily before you become pregnant and in early pregnancy. Some groups, such as the U.S. National Institutes of Health, suggest boosting your intake to at least 600 mcg once you're pregnant.) Not getting enough folic acid has been linked to neural tube birth defects (NTDs), such as spina bifida. Ask your healthcare provider if you need to take other supplementsCholine is another important nutrient that researchers now believe may help prevent NTDs. You need 450 mg of choline a day during pregnancy. Most prenatal vitamins don't contain it, so you'll have to get it from food or ask your healthcare provider about taking a choline supplement.Later in your pregnancy your provider may suggest that you take iron or calcium supplements to make sure you're getting enough of these key minerals. Some experts also recommend taking a vitamin D supplement throughout pregnancy.If you're a strict vegetarian, have a medical condition such as diabetes, gestational diabetes, or anemia, or have previously delivered a low-birth-weight baby, talk with your healthcare provider about other supplements you might need. A registered dietitian can also help with diet specifics.If you have trouble swallowing your vitamins or keeping them down, search for a chewable supplement or one in a powdered form that you can mix with water. And keep in mind that more isn't always better: Don't take megadoses of any vitamin, mineral, or herbal supplement without medical supervision  they could harm your developing baby.Learn more: See our chart of nutrients you need to help your baby grow.Don't diet while you're pregnantDieting during pregnancy could be harmful to you and your baby. Many eating plans designed for weight loss would leave you low not only on calories, but also on iron, folic acid, and other important vitamins and minerals.Weight gain is one of the most positive signs of a healthy pregnancy. Women who eat well and gain the& appropriate amount of weight are more likely to have healthy babies. If you're eating wholesome foods and slowly adding pounds, you can rest assured things are most likely on track.Keep in mind that when you put on your pregnancy weight may be as important as how much you gain. Healthcare providers recommend that you gain the least weight during the first trimester  roughly 1 to 5 pounds  and then gain roughly a pound a week in the second and third trimesters. (Talk with your provider if you're carrying twins or if you're underweight or overweight at the start of pregnancy  your recommended rate of weight gain might be different.)Learn more: Find out what eating for two really means. Eat small meals frequentlyIt's fine to get creative with your eating schedule during pregnancy. If nausea, food aversions, heartburn, or indigestion make eating full-size meals uncomfortable, try eating small, frequent meals throughout the day. As your pregnancy progresses and your baby increasingly crowds your stomach and other digestive organs, you'll have less space in your body for big meals anyway.If you're most hungry when it's not typically time to eat, go ahead and have your meal when the feeling strikes. Eating in a pattern that works for you will help you meet your nutritional needs during pregnancy.(Snacks in between meals are fine, but make healthy choices as often as you can  junk food offers little more than empty calories.)Learn more: Create a pregnancy meal plan you can live with.Treat yourself to something sweet on occasionAvoid making processed foods, packaged snacks, and sugary desserts the mainstay of your diet, but you don't have to give up all your favorite goodies just because you're pregnant. Try smart and tasty alternatives such as a banana smoothie, frozen all-fruit nonfat sorbet, or trail mix.And don't beat yourself up if you cave in to temptation now and again. The occasional cookie or piece of cake won't do any harm.11 foods to avoid during pregnancy Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:23Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:23Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

How diabetes affects Hispanic moms,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-diabetes-affects-hispanic-moms_3653748.bc,"Approved by ob-gyn Faustina Nevrez, M.D.A silent but deadly conditionPeople with diabetes often have no symptoms until the condition becomes serious  that's why it's called a silent illness. Latinos are more likely to get diabetes than people in other ethnic groups, and because many of us (32.7 percent) don't have medical insurance, we often skip annual checkups. For these reasons, many cases of diabetes go undiagnosed, mostly in women. One in four Latinas has diabetes.If you are Latina, it's a good idea to get screened for diabetes before you become pregnant, especially if you have some of the symptoms described below. Diabetes causes an excess of sugar in the blood that could affect your baby's development during the first few weeks of pregnancy.If you're already pregnant and suspect you could have diabetes, or if diabetes runs in your family, ask your doctor to screen you for the disease as soon as possible. Fortunately, nowadays diabetes can be treated and you can have a healthy baby even if you have it.What is diabetes?If you have diabetes, your body can't absorb enough nutrients from what you eat and you end up with too much sugar in your blood. This causes many health problems. But how does it happen?When your body is working normally, the food you eat is broken down by your digestive system into smaller and smaller bits. Eventually it turns into glucose (a type of sugar) and enters your bloodstream, where your cells absorb it. Glucose gives your body the fuel it needs for energy and good health.Your cells can only do their job, though, with the help of insulin, a substance secreted by the pancreas. Imagine that cells have a little door where food can enter, and insulin is the key to that door. If there's not enough insulin  or the insulin isn't working the way it should  glucose can't enter the cells. Instead, it continues to circulate in your blood.Consequences of diabetesEven though you can have diabetes and not know it, its effects are very real. Too much sugar in the blood can damage the eyes, the kidneys, and the circulatory system, to name a few. People with advanced diabetes who are not being treated for it often have wounds on their feet that do not heal and that eventually require surgery. Sometimes amputation is necessary.Diabetes in children is especially serious, as they have their whole life before them and unmonitored diabetes will affect their quality of life in the future.If you have diabetes, it is important to keep it under control during your pregnancy, because kids of diabetic moms who aren't being treated for their condition often develop problems such as obesity. Symptoms of diabetesDiabetes can cause many symptoms, but these are the most common ones:Frequent urination: The body tries to get rid of all that excess sugar through the urine.Thirst: Due to frequent urination, you may crave liquids. It's also common for your mouth to feel dry.Fatigue: Even if you have eaten well and rested, you don't have enough energy or ""fuel"" to function well because the glucose from your food can't penetrate the cells.Hunger: Your cells crave more food, even when you've eaten a good meal, because they're not getting enough nutrients.Blurry vision: The large amount of glucose in the veins and blood vessels causes your vision to deteriorate.Tingling feeling in your feet: Excess sugar in the blood damages the nerves. Because of this loss of sensation, diabetics should check their feet often for wounds that they haven't noticed.Wounds take longer to heal: Once again, the excess of glucose prevents the body's immune system from working properly and infections are more likely.If you think you may have diabetes, you should check with your doctor as soon as possible so you can get on a treatment plan. Types of diabetesThere are several types of diabetes:Type 1 diabetes: It's also called juvenile diabetes, because it usually starts before you turn 20. In this case, the pancreas doesn't secrete insulin, and the immune system attacks the pancreas's insulin-producing cells and destroys them. If you have this type of diabetes, you must inject insulin daily so you can assimilate the food you eat.Type 2 diabetes: This is most common type of diabetes among Latinos, and it often results from obesity. In type 2 diabetes, the pancreas doesn't secrete enough insulin or the cells don't use it correctly. To counteract this, the pancreas tries to secrete more insulin. After a while, if the condition isn't treated properly, cells in the pancreas are irreversibly damaged.People with type 2 diabetes are usually overweight, don't exercise much, and often have relatives with diabetes.Gestational diabetes: This type happens only during pregnancy, when hormones make it more difficult for your body to use insulin. Some women's bodies create extra insulin to compensate, but if that doesn't happen, glucose can't enter the cells to nourish them. Instead, the glucose stays in the bloodstream. The baby may gain a lot of weight, which can cause problems during labor and affect the baby's health. Gestational diabetes usually subsides after childbirth, when hormone levels go back to normal. Treatment for diabetesDiabetes is not an illness that goes away over time. Proper treatment helps insulin to work again, but if you abandon the treatment, the condition returns.Treatment for type 2 diabetes, the most widespread among Latinos, is a specific diet and exercise program. You have to eat small amounts of foods that are not too sugary so that they enter the bloodstream more slowly and insulin has time to process them. Exercise also helps burn up the excess sugar. Sometimes people's bodies don't respond to diet and exercise, though, and then they need to use insulin.People with type 1 diabetes need to use insulin because no other treatment is available.The treatment for gestational (pregnancy-induced) diabetes is the same as for type 2 diabetes: diet and moderate exercise. In some cases, women need to use insulin.By Lourdes Alcaiz, author of Waiting for Beb: A Pregnancy Guide for LatinasMore articles for Latinas:Important medical resources for you and your babyHerbs to avoid during pregnancy and breastfeedingIs it safe to use medicines from other countries?Why you may struggle with your weightTraditional beliefs and myths about pregnancyBaby care tips and traditions"
Equipment used to care for babies in the neonatal intensive care unit,https://www.babycenter.com/0_equipment-used-to-care-for-babies-in-the-neonatal-intensive_10300039.bc,"In the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), there are manymachines and other types of equipment used to care forsick babies with many different problems. These machines seem less intimidating when you understand how they can help your baby.This article introduces you to some of the equipment you'll see. Your baby may also be treated with other specialized machines during her NICU stay.BililightsThe bright blue fluorescent lights placed over a baby's incubator areused to treatjaundice(yellowing of the skin and eyes). Babies with jaundice usually receive this phototherapy treatment for three to seven days.Blood pressure monitorA blood pressure monitor is a machine connected to a small blood pressure cuff wrapped aroundyour baby's arm or leg. The cuff automatically takes your baby's blood pressure at regular times and displays the numbers on a screen.Cardiopulmonary monitorThis machine tracksyour baby's heart and breathing rates. It's attached toyour babywith small adhesive monitoring pads placed on her chest. The monitor displays information on the screen, which can be printed on paper. An alarm will sound ifyour baby's heart or breathing rate becomes too fast or too slow.Central lineThis is a small plastic tube inserted into a large blood vessel. Doctors can draw blood through the central line or use it to give your baby medicine or fluids.A PICC (peripherally inserted central catheter) line is a type of central line placed in one of the major blood vessels. Continuous positive airway pressure (C-PAP)Air is delivered to a baby's lungs either through small tubes in the baby's nose or through a tube inserted into her windpipe. The tubes are attached to a ventilator (respirator), which helps your baby breathe but does not breathe for her.Endotracheal tubeThis small plastic tube is inserted through a baby's nose or mouth down into the trachea (windpipe). The tube is attached to a ventilator (respirator), which can either help a baby breathe (as in C-PAP) or breathe for her.IncubatorBabies are placed in this clear plastic box, which keeps them warm and protects them from germs and noise.Intravenous (IV) lineMost premature and sick babies cannot be fed immediately, so they must receive nutrients and fluids through a vein (intravenously).To put in an IV, a doctor or nurse inserts a very small needle or tube into a tiny vein in the baby's hand, foot, arm, leg, or scalp. The needle is taped in place and attached to a thin plastic tube (IV line).The tube goes to an IV pump connected to a pole next to your baby's bed.Your baby also can receive medications and blood through the IV line.Nasal cannula or nasal prongsThese small plastic tubes fit intoyour baby's nostrils and deliver oxygen. They often are used with a treatment called continuous positive airway pressure (C-PAP), which uses a ventilator to deliver pressurized air to a baby's lungs.Oxygen hoodThis is a clear plastic box that fits overthe baby's head and supplies her with oxygen. This is used for babies who can breathe on their own but still need some extra oxygen.Pulse oximeterA pulse oximeter is a small U-shaped device that's wrapped around your baby's foot or hand and secured with a stretchy bandage. It uses a light sensor to measure the level of oxygen in your baby's blood. This sensor doesn't hurtyour baby at all. It helps doctors and nurses determine whether your baby needs more or less oxygen, while reducing the need for painful blood tests. Radiant warmerThis open bed has an overhead heating source that provides heat to your baby. A warmer may be used instead of an incubator if your baby needs to be handled frequently.RespiratorSee ventilator.Umbilical catheterYour baby'sumbilical cordhas two arteries and one vein, which end in her belly button. A thin tube (catheter) can be inserted into one of these vessels and threaded to the aorta, the largest artery supplying oxygen to the body.Through this catheter, doctors and nurses can painlessly draw blood, so they don't have to repeatedly stick the baby with needles. They can give her fluids, blood, nutrients, and medications through this tube. A small device can be attached to the catheter to continuously monitor a baby's blood pressure.VentilatorA ventilator (also called a respirator) is a mechanical breathing machine that delivers warmed and humidified air to a baby's lungs. The sickest babies receive mechanical ventilation, meaning that the ventilator temporarily breathes for them while their lungsrecover.The air is delivered to the baby's lungs through an endotracheal tube (a small plastic tube that's inserted through a baby's nose or mouth down into the windpipe). The amount of oxygen, air pressure, and number of breaths per minute can be regulated to meet each baby's needs.Video: Preemies in the NICUSeewhat happens in the neonatal intensive care unitand how the littlest babies are treated.

Adventurous first foods for babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_adventurous-first-foods-for-babies_10320503.bc,"Baby food doesn't have to be bland to be healthy. Infant cereal, banana puree, and mashed carrots are perfectly fine, but babies can enjoy a much wider range of flavors. Exposure to different healthy foods now may guard against later fixations on ""kid foods""  crackers, pasta, sweet drinks  that aren't particularly good for them.Here are some ideas to help you escape the baby food rut. Even if some of these options aren't your personal favorites, your baby might love them  so try not let your own tastes get in the way of what you serve up at this stage. And of course, depending on your baby's chewing and swallowing skills, you can chop, grind, or puree them as needed.(Note: The old advice about waiting until age 1 or later to introduce allergenic foods no longer applies to most babies, but it's still a good idea to introduce new foods gradually. Feed your baby one new food at a time, waiting at least three days between new items. That way if there is an allergic reaction, you'll be able to tell what's causing it.)Sour fruitsSurprisingly, many kids love sour foods, says Matthew Amster-Burton, food writer and author of Hungry Monkey: A Food-Loving Father's Quest to Raise an Adventurous Eater.Try serving your baby some pureed sour cherries (after removing the pits, of course) or cut the cherries into chunks for older babies. You can also try plums, which are pleasingly tart. Serve them plain or in a crumble.5 tips to develop healthy eating habits Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:05Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:05Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosStewed meat""Stewed meat is the ideal baby food,"" says Amster-Burton. ""It's easy, it tastes even better when it's a day old, and you can cook it in a dozen different ways. For example, you can do a Chinese beef stew with soy sauce and ginger, or a Mexican beef stew with chiles.""Babies eating chiles? Yep. Babies in other parts of the world eat and enjoy spicy food, and Amster-Burton's own daughter has loved Mexican beef stew since she was 8 months old. He recommends using the milder chile varieties, such as Anaheims and poblanos (available in most supermarkets), rather than super-hot types, such as habaneros and jalapenos, that can irritate the skin and mouth.If you're ready to branch out from beef, Amster-Burton recommends carnitas (stewed pork shoulder). ""Cook the pork shoulder with a little lime juice or orange juice until the liquid is gone and the meat is soft. It's great for tacos,"" he says.Cruciferous veggiesGreen beans and sweet potatoes are considered ideal baby foods, but turnips and cauliflower? Not so much. That's a shame, because cruciferous vegetables  which also include broccoli, bok choy, kale, cabbage, and brussels sprouts  are packed to the brim with important nutrients. And just because they aren't your typical baby food doesn't mean babies don't smack their lips over them.""My son liked mashed turnips, which really surprised me,"" says dietitian Jill Nussinow of Santa Rosa, California.

A report released by the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) in 2008 says there's no evidence that withholding fish and other common allergenic foods from babies in the first year prevents allergies.The AAP says it's fine to feed these foods to babies 4 to 6 months of age, as long as they don't show signs of an allergy (such as eczema) to food or anything else. If your baby has a strong family history of asthma or allergies, it may still be safe to introduce allergenic foods, but check with the doctor first.""Most parents wouldn't think about giving their baby salmon. Yet it is such a great source of DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid,"" says Bridget Swinney, a registered dietitian and author of Baby Bites, a book about feeding babies and toddlers.Guide to Firsts: Solid foodOur checklist helps you get ready to feed your baby.""I'd simmer the fish with a little fresh or dried dill, or cilantro,"" Swinney says. She suggests combining the herbs with 1/2 cup water, broth, or milk and herbs and heating to a boil. Add 4 ounces of boneless, skinless salmon and reduce heat to simmer. Cook 3 to 4 minutes or until fish flakes easily. Chop fish finely or puree with 1 or 2 tablespoons of the cooking liquid.Whole grainsWhole grains such as quinoa and millet expose your baby to a whole new world of food textures, which is important for oral development, says Seattle pediatrician Susanna Block. ""The textural variety of different grains helps babies learn to use their mouths and tongues, which can really help them with speech,"" she explains.Many grains taste better with a little something extra  and your baby can handle it. So if a recipe calls for seasoning, don't feel you have to ""bland it down."" A few chopped onions could transform wheat berries or bulgur into your baby's all-time favorite snack.""I cooked quinoa in vegetable broth for extra flavor and served it with cooked, cubed butternut squash.

Calcium in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_calcium-in-your-childs-diet_10324689.bc,"Calcium is crucial for good health and development. Read on to find out how much calcium your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Why calcium is importantCalcium is vital for building strong bones and teeth, promoting nerve and muscle function, helping blood clot, and activating the enzymes that convert food into energy. About 99 percent of the body's calcium is stored in the teeth and bones. And because children are growing new bone all the time, they need a steady supply of calcium to support healthy growth.How much calcium does your child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 700 milligrams (mg) per dayAges 4 to 8 years: 1,000 mg per dayYour child doesn't have to get the recommended amount of calcium every day. Instead, aim for that amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of calciumDairy products such as milk, yogurt, and cheese are some of the best sources of calcium, but you'll also find it in some unexpected places. Here are some calcium-rich foods to try:1/4 cup raw tofu prepared with calcium sulfate: 217 mg (The calcium content of tofu varies, depending on how it's processed. Check the label.)1/2 cup plain yogurt: 207 mg1 tablespoon blackstrap molasses: 172 mg1/2 cup fruit yogurt: 122 to 192 mg1/2 cup calcium-fortified orange juice: 133 to 250 mg1/4 cup ricotta cheese: 167 mg1/2 cup milk: 150 mg1/2 cup chocolate milk: 144 mg1/2 ounce Swiss cheese: 112 mg1/2 cup vanilla frozen yogurt, soft-serve: 102 mg1/2 ounce cheddar cheese: 102 mg1 slice whole grain bread: 24 mg1/2 ounce mozzarella cheese: 103 mg1/4 cup collard greens: 66 mg1/4 cup homemade pudding (from mix or scratch): 76 mg1 tablespoon tahini (sesame seed butter): 64 mg1/4 cup turnip greens: 50 mg1/4 cup cooked spinach: 60 mg1/2 cup calcium-fortified cereal (ready to eat): 51 mg1/2 cup calcium-fortified soy beverage: 40 to 250 mgThe amount of calcium a food contains varies somewhat, depending on the brand, the size of the fruit or vegetable, and so on. Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, depending on their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Calcium content isn't affected by fat, but the dietary fat in dairy products plays an important role in your child's development. Children younger than 2 need to get half their calories from fat for healthy growth and brain development, so they should eat only full-fat dairy products. But unless your doctor advises otherwise, children older than 2 need to get fewer calories from fat, so they should eat low-fat or nonfat dairy products to maintain a healthy weight.Tips for maximizing your child's calcium intakeSome experts believe that many children are falling short of their calcium requirement. This could be partly because juice and other nondairy drinks are so popular that kids are drinking less milk. Here are some simple steps you can take to make sure your child gets enough calcium:Use milk instead of water when preparing cereal, hot cocoa, and soup.Use evaporated milk in place of regular milk in recipes  it has twice the calcium of regular milk.Add yogurt to fruit salads; nonfat milk powder to pancake batter, sauces, and smoothies; and cheese to vegetables, sauces, and mashed potatoes.Buy calcium-fortified juice, bread, and cereal.Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, so make sure your child gets enough vitamin D  about 600 international units (IU) per day.Can your child get too much calcium?An extremely high level of calcium in the blood is usually due to an underlying medical condition rather than consuming too much calcium in food and supplements. The Institute of Medicine recommends that kids age 1 to 8 get no more than 2,500 mg of calcium daily  that's roughly the equivalent of eight 8-ounce glasses of milk. While it's a good idea to keep an eye on how much calcium your child gets from her diet, it's unlikely that she will get too much calcium from food alone.Calcium supplements, on the other hand, can sometimes be a problem. For instance, taking excess calcium supplements has been linked to a higher risk of kidney stones.A couple of notes of caution: If your child is a big milk drinker, make sure she's not getting too many extra calories from milk alone, or that she doesn't fill up on milk and then have no appetite for other healthy foods. Also, too much calcium can cause constipation.Find out more: Nine other important nutrients for childrenShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2013. Dietary fat and toddlers.

Iron in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-in-your-childs-diet_10324691.bc,"Iron is crucial for children's health and development. Read on to find out how much iron your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for childrenWhy iron is importantIron is important for making hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying red pigment in blood, and myoglobin, a pigment that stores oxygen in muscles. Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency in the United States, and a lack of iron can causeanemia, resulting in fatigue and weakness.Iron also affects brain development, so anemia can also cause long-lasting problems with cognitive development. A severe iron deficiency can be life-threatening.How much iron does your child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 7 milligrams (mg) per dayAges 4 to 8 years: 10 mg dailyIf your child eats a vegetarian diet, aim for twice as much iron because iron from nonanimal sources is harder for the body to absorb.Your child doesn't have to get enough iron every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.Child Height PredictorFind out how tall your child is likely to be at age 18.Animal sources and plant sources of iron: What's the difference?Heme iron  the kind you get from animal sources such as meat, seafood, and poultry  is easily absorbed by the body. The body needs help to absorb nonheme iron, which is the kind found in nonanimal sources like dark green leafy vegetables, legumes, fortified bread and grains, and dried fruit. (Egg yolks contain mostly nonheme iron.)You can increase the amount of nonheme iron the body absorbs by serving it with foods that contain heme iron or with foods rich in vitamin C, such as orange juice, oranges, strawberries, red and green bell peppers, papaya, broccoli, grapefruit, cantaloupe, tomatoes, broccoli, mangoes, and sweet potatoes.This is especially important for children eating vegetarian diets: They need to focus on eating plenty of iron-rich foods with foods high in vitamin C to boost absorption.Good sources of ironIron can be found in a variety of foods. Here are some good sources:1/2 cup fortified, ready-to-eat cereal: 12 mg1/2 cup fortified oatmeal, prepared with water: 5 mg1/4 cup raw tofu: 2.22 mg (The iron content of tofu varies by type, so check the label.)1/4 cup soybeans: 2 mg1/4 cup boiled lentils: 2 mg1/4 cup baked beans with pork and tomato sauce: 2 mg1/4 cup navy beans: 1 mg1/4 cup kidney beans: 1 mg1 ounce braised lean beef, chuck: 1 mg1 teaspoon blackstrap molasses: 1 mg1/2 medium broiled hamburger (1.5 oz.), 95 percent lean: 1 mg1/4 cup garbanzo beans: 1 mg1/4 cup cooked frozen spinach: 0.9 mg1/4 cup black beans: 0.9 mg1/4 cup pinto beans: 0.9 mgOne slice whole wheat bread: 0.9 mg1/4 cup raisins: 0.7 mgThe amount of iron in a food varies somewhat, depending on brand of the product or the cut of the meat. Note that raisins and other chunky foods (like beans) are choking hazards for very young children. Mash or cut these foods into small pieces.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts of food shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can your child get too much iron?Yes. Although it's essentially impossible to get too much iron from food, supplements are another matter. Excessive iron from supplements can be toxic to children, causing serious health problems or even death. The tolerable upper intake level (UL) for iron is 40 mg per day for children age 13 and younger. That's the maximum amount considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine.If you're concerned that your child isn't getting enough iron, talk to his doctor before giving your child a supplement.And always keep iron supplements locked up and out of sight  it's easy for curious little hands to get into medicine and supplements when you're not looking. And never encourage kids to take chewable vitamins as a ""treat,"" or they may take them when you're not looking.Show sources Hide sources IOM. 2001.

Vitamin A also promotes the health and growth of cells and tissues in the body, particularly those in the hair, nails, and skin.How much vitamin A does my child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 1,000 international units (IU), or 300 micrograms (mcg) retinol activity equivalents (RAE), of vitamin A per dayAge 4 years and up: 1,333 IU, or 400 mcg RAE per dayYour child doesn't have to get enough vitamin A every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of vitamin AColorful fruits and vegetables are packed with vitamin A. Here are some of the best sources:1/2 cup carrot juice: 22,567 IU1/4 cup cooked sweet potato: 12,907 IUone raw carrot (7 1/2 inches): 8,666 IU1/4 cup cooked carrots: 6,709 IU1/4 cup cooked spinach: 5,729 IU1/4 cup butternut squash: 5,717 IU1/4 cup cooked kale: 4,979 IU1/2 cup canned vegetable soup: 2,910 IU1/4 cup cantaloupe: 1,352 IU1/4 cup apricots, packed in juice: 1,031 IU1/4 cup red bell pepper: 720 IU1/4 cup raw spinach: 703 IU1/4 cup sliced mango: 631 IU1/2 cup fortified instant oatmeal, prepared with water: 626 IU1/4 cup cooked broccoli: 603 IU1/4 cup cooked frozen peas: 525 IU1/2 cup tomato juice: 546 IU1/2 cup fortified milk: 250 IU1/4 cup canned peaches, packed in juice: 236 IU1/2 large egg, scrambled: 160 IU1/2 ounce cheddar cheese: 142 IU1/4 cup green bell pepper: 137 IU1/4 cup fresh peaches: 125 IU1/4 cup papaya: 83 IUThe amount of vitamin A in a food varies somewhat, depending on the size of the fruit or vegetable.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts of food shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much vitamin A?Yes. Normally, the body has to convert vitamin A from its inactive form to its active form, so the body can use it. Usually an excess of vitamin A is from taking supplements that already contain high levels of the active form of the vitamin.It's also possible to get too much of the active form of vitamin A from animal sources, like liver and milk. For example, beef liver contains 21,566 IU per slice.By contrast, it's nearly impossible to overdose by getting an abundance of carotenoids, the orange and yellow pigments in carrots and other vegetables and fruits. When you eat vitamin A from these nonanimal sources, the body converts only what it needs from carotenoids to the active form of vitamin A. What will most likely happen if you go on a carrot binge is that your skin will turn yellow-orange (and that effect disappears once you go back to eating a balanced diet).How much vitamin A is too much?Children ages 1 to 3 should not get more than 2,000 IU (600 mcg RAE) a day. Children ages 4 to 8 should not get more than 3,000 IU (900 mcg RAE).Those are the maximum amounts considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine. Don't give your child a vitamin supplement that contains more than the recommended amounts of vitamin A that your child needs every day.Too much of the active form of vitamin A can cause nausea and vomiting, headache, dizziness, blurred vision, and lack of muscle coordination. Long-term effects include osteoporosis, liver problems, and disorders of the central nervous system.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for children"

Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of magnesiumNuts and legumes are some of the best sources of magnesium. Leafy green vegetables are another good source because the substance that gives vegetables their color contains the mineral. Bread made from whole grain wheat flour is another good option. Some magnesium-rich foods to try:1/2 cup all-bran cereal: 93 mg1 ounce dry roasted cashews: 74 mg1/4 cup oil roasted peanuts: 63 mg1 cup soymilk, plain: 61 mg1/2 cup edamame (shelled and cooked): 50 mg1 tablespoon almond butter: 45 mg1/4 cup cooked spinach: 39 mgone packet instant oatmeal: 36 mg1/4 cup black beans: 30 mg1 tablespoon smooth peanut butter: 25 mgone slice whole wheat bread: 23 mg1/2 cup plain skim milk yogurt: 21 mg1/4 cup long grain brown rice: 21 mg1/4 cup kidney beans: 18 mg1/4 cup black-eyed peas: 17 mg1/2 medium banana: 16 mg1/2 cup milk (low-fat): 17 mg1/4 cup raisins: 12 mg1/4 cup cubed avocado: 11 mg1 ounce halibut: 8 mgThe amount of magnesium in a food can vary depending on serving size or brand. Note that nuts and seeds are choking hazards for very young children, and nut butters should be spread thinly for the same reason. Other foods (like beans) should be mashed.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much magnesium?From supplements, yes. Getting too much magnesium from diet alone is highly unlikely, but it is possible to overload on magnesium in dietary supplements.Taking too much magnesium in supplement form can cause problems like diarrhea and stomach cramps. In very large doses, magnesium can be toxic.The tolerable upper intake level for magnesium in supplement form is 65 mg per day for children ages 1 to 3, and 110 mg per day for children ages 4 to 8. That's the maximum amount of magnesium added to a normal daily diet considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine.There is no upper intake level of magnesium you get from food.Show sources Hide sources IOM. 1997.

Vitamin C in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-c-in-your-childs-diet_10324695.bc,"Vitamin C is crucial for children's good health and development. Read on to find out how much vitamin C your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Why vitamin C is importantVitamin C helps form and repair red blood cells, bones, and tissues. It helps your child's gums stay healthy and strengthens your child's blood vessels, minimizing bruising from falls and scrapes. In addition, vitamin C helps cuts and wounds heal, boosts the immune system, and keeps infections at bay. And it helps the body absorb iron from food sources.How much vitamin C does my child need?Ages 1 to 3 years: 15 milligrams (mg) dailyAges 4 to 8: 25 mg dailyThis vitamin is available in so many foods that deficiencies are extremely rare. Children who are very picky eaters and don't eat a lot of fruits and vegetables may not get enough vitamin C. Also, children exposed to secondhand smoke need more vitamin C to repair cell damage from cigarettes.If you're concerned that your child doesn't get enough vitamin C, ask your child's doctor whether you need to boost your child's intake.Your child doesn't have to get enough vitamin C every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of vitamin CBrightly colored fruits and vegetables are great sources of vitamin C.1/4 cup guava: 82.5 mg1/2 cup orange juice: 50 mg1/4 cup red bell pepper: 47.5 mg1/4 cup papaya: 47.5 mg1/4 cup kiwi: 41 mg1/2 medium orange: 30 mg1/4 cup broccoli: 30 mgthree medium strawberries: 21 mg1/4 cup pink grapefruit: 23 mg1/4 cup cantaloupe: 17 mg1/4 cup mango: 11 mg1/4 cup raw tomato: 5 mg1/4 cup spinach: 4.5 mg1/4 cup potato, cooked without skin: 3 mg1/4 cup banana: 2 mgThe amount of vitamin C in a food varies somewhat, depending on the size of the fruit or vegetable.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much vitamin C?Vitamin C is water soluble, so any excess is flushed from the body in your child's urine. However, megadoses can still cause nausea, diarrhea, kidney stones, and gastritis (inflammation of the stomach lining).Children ages 1 to 3 should not get more than 400 mg of vitamin C a day. Children ages 4 to 8 should not get more than 650 mg a day.Those are the maximum amounts considered safe by the Food and Nutrition Board of the Institute of Medicine. So be careful before giving a child chewable supplements meant for adults because each tablet can contain up to 500 mg.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for childrenShow sources Hide sources IOM. 2001.

Vitamin D in your child's diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_vitamin-d-in-your-childs-diet_10324696.bc,"Vitamin D is crucial for children's good health and development. Read on to find out how much vitamin D your child needs, which sources are the best, and how to avoid getting too little or too much.Find out more: Ten important nutrients for childrenWhy vitamin D is importantVitamin D helps the body absorb minerals like calcium and builds strong teeth and bones. According to researcher Michael F. Holick, professor of medicine, physiology, and biophysics at Boston University School of Medicine, vitamin D deficiency can not only cause rickets (a disease that can lead to bone deformity and fractures), it can also keep a child from reaching her genetically programmed height and peak bone mass.Vitamin D also functions as a hormone with many other jobs in the body, including regulation of the immune system, insulin production, and cell growth.How much vitamin D does my child need?Infants up to 12 months old need 400 international units (IU), or 10 micrograms (mcg), a day. Children older than 1 need 600 IU, or 15 mcg, a day.Your child doesn't have to get enough vitamin D every day. Instead, aim to get the recommended amount as an average over the course of a few days or a week.The best sources of vitamin DVitamin D is called the ""sunshine vitamin"" because the body can produce it when the skin is exposed to sunlight. But your child's body isn't able to make vitamin D when covered with clothing or sunscreen to block the sun's rays. Other obstacles to vitamin D production from sun exposure include smog, clouds, dark skin, and geographic location.Though it's hard to estimate how much time a person needs to spend in the sun to make the recommended amount of vitamin D, some researchers say spending 5 to 30 minutes outside between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. at least twice a week should do it.But experts warn that UV radiation from the sun is the main cause of skin cancer, and it's hard to judge whether you can get enough vitamin D from the sun without increasing your risk of a potentially deadly skin cancer. So consider finding other ways to get the vitamin D you need.The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all infants, children, and teens take vitamin D supplements of 400 IU each day. Kids who are too young for chewable vitamins can take liquid supplements.Some of the best food sources of vitamin D:1 ounce salmon: 102 IU6 ounces fortified yogurt: 80 IU1 ounce canned tuna, drained and packed in oil: 66 IU1/2 cup orange juice, fortified with 25 percent of daily value for vitamin D: 50 IU1/2 cup fortified milk (whole, low-fat, or skim): 49 IUone slice fortified American cheese: 40 IU1/2 cup fortified, ready-to-eat cereal: 19 IU1 ounce mackerel: 11.6 IU1/2 large egg yolk: 10 IU1/2 teaspoon fortified margarine: 10 IU1/2 ounce Swiss cheese: 6 IUThe amount of vitamin D in a food varies somewhat, depending on the brand of the product.Kids may eat more or less than the amounts shown, given their age and appetite. Estimate the nutrient content accordingly.Can my child get too much vitamin D?It's unlikely but possible. On the contrary, many health experts are concerned that the current recommended amount is too low and that children actually need much more.That said, vitamin D can be harmful if you get too much. According to the Office of Dietary Supplements (a department of the National Institutes of Health), the safe upper limit for infants up to 12 months old is 1,000 to 1,500 IU daily. For kids 1 to 8 years old, the safe upper limit is 2,500 to 3,000 IU each day.Vitamin D is stored in body tissue, so it's best not to get more than what health experts recommend. (Vitamin C, by contrast, isn't stored in the body  any excess is simply eliminated in urine.)To be safe, if you have a very young child, stick to the 400 IUs recommended as an infant supplement. More than 400 IUs may be fine for an older child, but check with your child's doctor to be sure.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Picky eaters: The One-Color Kid,https://www.babycenter.com/0_picky-eaters-the-one-color-kid_10331625.bc,"When faced with a picky eater, how do you ensure your child gets the nutrients he needs - without a fight. Our food experts offer strategies and recipes for your one-color kid.See all eight picky eaters here.The One-Color KidThe dilemma: Typically, only beige or white food passes muster. Your child's eating world centers around bread, cheese, pasta, milk, rice, potatoes  and not much else.The nutritional concern: Chances are, if your child is on a one-color kick, he's probably not including pale veggies such as cauliflower in his repertoire so he's missing the same nutrients as the Veggie Hater. Plus, those colorless foods he favors often consist of refined grains or simple starches, which lack the fiber that regulates digestion, prevents constipation, stabilizes blood sugar, and staves off hunger.Vicki Lansky, mother of two, grandmother of three, and author of Feed Me I'm Yours: If your child is on a color-specific food jag, find ways to enhance what he'll eat. Make beige carbohydrates more nutritious by adding wheat germ, soy powder, or eggs for protein. If it's white  like mashed potatoes  try adding in a little mashed cottage cheese.Jessica Seinfeld, mother of three and author of Deceptively Delicious: To get veggies in the mix, add some cauliflower puree to potatoes or a little butternut squash puree to macaroni and cheese. Start slowly. Some kids are more likely to notice hidden additions than others. Try a tablespoon or two of puree at first and then taste and check the color and texture as you go. Add more gradually  you know what your kid will eat  to make sure the flavor of, say, the squash doesn't overpower the cheese.Ann Cooper, nutrition expert who revamps school cafeterias around the country and coauthor of Lunch Lessons: Find a healthier way to do it. In our schools, we serve whole grain bread and buns that have some white flour. Or we mix white and brown rice together. Most kids don't even notice.Ellyn Satter, mother of three, grandmother of six, and author of Secrets of Feeding a Healthy Family: Put the beige foods alongside colorful foods that your child may be skeptical of. Match familiar and unfamiliar favorites with foods that are less so, then leave it up to the child. You can accommodate your child's preferences without catering to his demands. That means no making separate meals or acting like a short-order cook.Jennifer Iserloh, private chef and author of Secrets of a Skinny Chef: Offer just a little of something with color. Parents often make the mistake of filling a plate with something children are wary of  it can be too much for some kids. Or serve it on a small dish so it doesn't overwhelm your child.Pumpkin MuffinsBy Vicki LanskyThese autumn-inspired treats  full of nutritious pumpkin, chewy raisins, and fragrant spices  are sure to please your pickiest eater. Serve them for breakfast along with eggs or cottage cheese and fruit.For an easy dessert, top muffins with vanilla ice cream or yogurt and maybe a drizzle of caramel sauce if you're feeling decadent. You may want to cut these muffins in half before serving to your kids.Ingredients:1 1/2 cups flour1/2 cup sugar2 teaspoons baking powder1 teaspoon cinnamon1/2 teaspoon ginger1/4 teaspoon cloves1/2 cup raisins1 egg, slightly beaten1/2 cup milk1/2 cup canned pumpkin (solid pack)1/4 cup butter or margarine, melted2 1/2 teaspoons sugar mixed with 1 teaspoon cinnamonInstructions:Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F. Grease a 12-cup muffin pan or line with paper liners. In a large bowl, sift together the first six ingredients. Stir in raisins.In a separate bowl, combine the egg, milk, pumpkin, and melted butter or margarine.Add the wet ingredients to the flour mixture and mix until just blended.Divide the batter among the prepared muffin cups, filling each about 2/3 full. Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon on top. Bake for 20 to 25 minutes or until a tester inserted in the center comes out clean.Makes 12 muffins. Cottage Cheese PancakesBy Vicki LanskyOn a lazy weekend morning, nothing is better than a stack of pancakes piled high. Unfortunately, most pancakes aren't very nutritious, and by the time you load them with maple syrup and butter, they're very high in fat and sugar. Your kids will love these high-protein, low-fat cottage cheese pancakes. Top them with fresh berries or low-sugar jam to make them extra special.Ingredients:3 eggs1 cup cottage cheese2 tablespoons butter or margarine, melted2 tablespoons flour or cornmeal*Instructions:Beat eggs with a small mixer (or whisk). Add cottage cheese and mix until fairly smooth. Add butter or margarine. Stir in flour or cornmeal until just blended.Drop small amounts of batter onto a hot griddle or frying pan. Cook pancakes on one side until bubbles start to form around the edges. Turn pancakes over and cook on the other side until firm to the touch.Serve immediately.Serving amount varies with the size of pancakes.*Note from the Editor: For a heartier and less eggy pancake, add 1/3 cup of flour or cornmeal to the wet mixture.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Dinners kids will come running for,https://www.babycenter.com/0_dinners-kids-will-come-running-for_1186663.bc,"Try these tips and suggestions for nutritious meals that kids won't turn their noses up at.Cook for more than one mealWhen you have an hour to make something special, double the recipe so you'll have enough to refrigerate or freeze for another dinner. Many casseroles taste even better reheated. The same goes for stews (try using lots of vegetables and only a few ounces of lean meat) and hearty soups; the ingredients seem to meld more fully over a day or two.Keep a well-stocked cupboardWith the right ingredients handy, you can easily throw together a terrific meal without having to shop. Essentials include pasta, rice, potatoes, onions, a variety of canned and frozen vegetables, canned beans, tomato sauce, olive or canola oil, and cheese. One example: While the water for your rigatoni or penne boils, dice an onion and saute it in a few drops of oil; then heat some spaghetti sauce in the microwave. You might zap some frozen broccoli, too, if your kids will eat it; broccoli turns basic noodles into pasta primavera.Take advantage of convenience foodsPrewashed salad greens and bags of baby carrots make it easy to add vegetables to any meal. And don't hesitate to use frozen veggies. Sure, fresh vegetables generally taste best and look most appealing. But they haven't necessarily retained more vitamins and minerals than the freezer versions. Either way, the trick to limiting nutrient loss is using fast cooking methods, so microwave your spinach or steam it briefly on the stove. Another useful item is canned soup; read labels to find ones with less sodium, little fat, and plenty of veggies, or check out the lines of delicious vegetarian soups (such as hearty ham-free split pea) at your local health food store.Time your recipesIt's easy to overestimate how long it takes to prepare a dish  especially if you chop up the vegetables, pause to put clothes in the washer and water your houseplants, then return to the kitchen to finish up. The next time you fix one of your family's favorites, watch the clock, don't stop until you're done, and write the total time (prep plus cooking) beside the recipe for future reference. Organize recipes by how much time they take. You may discover you have more options than you'd realized. Let someone else do the cookingSome evenings you simply don't have the time  or the will  to make dinner. Luckily, more and more businesses  local restaurants as well as large supermarket chains  offer well-made and wholesome prepared meals, from vegetable lasagna to roasted chicken. Find three or four your family likes, and keep the list handy for those nights when you barely have time to sort through the mail. Just make sure the items are relatively low in fat and well balanced. Try to work some fiber and other nutrients into the meal by accompanying the main dish with a loaf of whole grain bread and at least two vegetables; you can get there with a simple salad of greens and tomatoes, steamed cauliflower and green beans, or some raw carrot sticks and a bowl of frozen peas zapped in the microwave. Don't forget a colorful fruit salad for dessert  even if it's just a sliced banana, a few fresh apple chunks, and water-packed canned peaches.Comforting Cauliflower Casserole(Time: 25 minutes) If your kids like macaroni and cheese, try this delicious  and more nutritious  variation. Chop a head of cauliflower into bite-size pieces. Add the cauliflower and your kids' favorite pasta to a large pot of boiling water. (A one-pound package of pasta generally serves a family of five or six.) Cook until the noodles are tender, usually about 10 minutes. Drain and pour into a pasta bowl. Stir in two tablespoons or olive oil. Then add pepper, grated parmesan cheese, and a bag or can of corn  or, if your kids like them, chopped black olives. Toss and serve with a salad or steamed carrots.Speedy Soup and Sandwich(Time: 30 minutes) Believe it or not, you can create a delicious homemade vegetable soup in almost no time at all. Saute a chopped onion in olive oil in a two-quart pan. Add a cup of canned low-sodium broth, two cups of coarsely chopped fresh or canned tomatoes, a can of beans, and a cup of fresh, frozen, or canned corn. If you have any suitable veggies in the crisper, toss them in. Dust lightly with pepper. For sandwiches, choose a truly whole grain bread (make sure whole is the first word in the ingredients list), line a platter with your family's favorite fillings (including lettuce, tomato slices, and other veggies), and let them all make their own. Instead of offering them mayonnaise, which is loaded with fat, put a few types of mustard on the table. Taco Fiesta(Time: 20 minutes) All you need are taco shells, a cup or two of chopped lettuce (choose romaine or red leaf over iceberg), a coarsely chopped tomato, canned black beans, a jar of mild salsa, and grated Monterey Jack cheese. Put the fillings on the table, and let the kids create their own Mexican masterpieces. (To lower the meal's fat content, see if your children will be happy using heated corn tortillas instead of taco shells, which are stiff because they've been fried.)Hasty Homemade Pizza(Time: 30 minutes) Thanks to premade pizza crusts, available in most grocery stores, concocting a crowd-pleasing pizza is a breeze. Spread the crust with tomato sauce, then get your children to help with the toppings  a tactic that raises the odds that any picky eater in the family will do more than nibble off the cheese. Encourage the kids to be creative, and tell them to pick at least two vegetables. Great combinations include onions and sweet red peppers, wilted spinach and black olives, and corn and sliced tomatoes. If your family insists on meat, add some reduced-fat pepperoni or extra-lean ground beef sparingly for flavor. Finish the pie with a light sprinkling of low-fat mozzarella cheese, and cook according to the instructions on the package. Serve with a salad of mixed greens."
How to get your toddler to eat more healthy food,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-get-your-toddler-to-eat-more-healthy-food_1186688.bc,"Eating well gives your toddler the energy he needs to learn and grow. And it'll help him stay healthy, maintain a healthy weight, and establish good lifelong eating habits. Here are some ways to make nutritious food the most appealing choice:Get your toddler involvedA great way to get your toddler excited about eating well is to get him involved in the family's food decisions. He's too young to help you develop menus, of course, but he'd probably love an excursion to the grocery store.As soon as your child's old enough to manage it, ask him to hold the grocery list for you as you shop. Give him a few choices along the way: Peaches or mangoes? Peas or carrots? Graham crackers or fig bars?Make a habit of selecting one new fruit or vegetable to try each week, keeping in mind that it may take a few tries before your child will actually eat it. Some doctors suggest that parents offer children new foods at least ten times before moving on to other healthy options.Make meals and snacks funEnlist your toddler's help in putting toppings on a pizza or grated cheese on a casserole. Arrange carrot sticks, cherry tomatoes, and bell peppers to look like a face on his plate. Make pancakes in the shape of his initials and cut toast into a heart shape. Offer yogurt for him to dip graham crackers or fruit slices in, and outfit him with a lively placemat and dinnerware.Go to the sourceTake your toddler on an outing to an orchard, community garden, or berry farm so he can see where the food on his plate comes from. At this age he may not make the connection, but the experience might inspire him to try something he wouldn't otherwise be interested in.Be picky about juicesFruit juices count toward your toddler's daily fruit intake, but be particular about the kind and amount of juice you offer. Serve your toddler only 100 percent fruit juice or fruit-vegetable juice combinations. (These are full of nutrients and contain less natural sugar than many fruit juices.) Some kids even enjoy vegetable juice straight up!If your toddler won't drink milk, you may want to try juices fortified with calcium and vitamin D. Don't offer fruit ""drinks"" because they may contain as little as 10 percent juice and have an array of artificial flavorings and sweeteners.Keep in mind that even the healthiest fruit juices can easily become too much of a good thing. Juice can contribute to childhood obesity and malnourishment because a child who drinks a great deal of juice gets extra calories but not all the nutrients he needs. It can also lead to tooth decay, especially if your toddler carries around a bottle or sippy cup throughout the day.So limit your toddler to  to  of a cup of fruit juice each day, and use fresh fruit to meet the rest of his requirement. When he's thirsty, offer him water. Shake and bakeSmoothies are an easy way to get fruit and other nutritious foods into your child's diet. All you need is a blender and a few simple ingredients. You can use your choice of fresh fruit, frozen fruit (such as berries or bananas), or even canned pineapple or peaches. (Strain the syrup firstor better yet, buy the kind packed in 100 percent fruit juice.)You might want to include tofu or hard-cooked egg whitesthey add protein without changing the taste or textureand a bit of ground flax seed for extra fiber and omega 3s. Blend with fruit juice or add milk, yogurt, or frozen yogurt for a creamier drink and a dose of calcium.Whole wheat and bran muffins are good sources of grains and fiber, and they can also be a vehicle for fruits and vegetables. Make or buy them with bananas, blueberries, carrots, pineapple, or zucchini.Fortify but don't foolYou might try incorporating healthy foods into dishes you know your toddler likes, but don't be sneaky about it. (Even if he falls for it now, he may later feel betrayed when he figures out what's up.)Tell him you're giving him some special pasta spirals tonightwith spinach mixed in or with broccoli and cheese on top. Better to be up-front and encourage an adventurous approach to eating from the get-go.Make it countBe aware of your child's nutritional needs, but don't worryit's not hard to meet a toddler's daily requirements. A toddler only needs about 1,000 calories a day. That means a serving of vegetables is 1 to 2 tablespoons and a serving of meat is about the size of the palm of his hand. Here are some easy ways to serve up good nutrition:A tablespoon of peanut butter spread thinly (large dollops can cause choking) on a slice of whole wheat bread and half a cup of whole milk supply your toddler with lots of protein, magnesium, zinc, fiber, and calcium.And just one banana, half an apple, and half a cup of strawberries meet most toddlers' suggested intake of fruit for the day.Be a good role modelAs you consider all the ways of getting your toddler to eat well, remember to practice what you preach. If your child sees you eating lots of junk food or skipping meals, you can't expect him to eat properly. Make an effort to eat whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and you and your child will both be better off.Be upbeatForget the food fights. Let your toddler decide how much to eat. And don't use a sweet treat as a bribe or withhold it as a punishment.Try to make mealtime togetherat the table, not in front of the television as enjoyable as possible, so that your child can establish a good, healthy relationship with food.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Eating a vegetarian diet during pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_eating-a-vegetarian-diet-during-pregnancy_1313874.bc,"Is it safe to eat a vegetarian diet in pregnancy?Yes. As long as you eat a variety of healthy vegetarian foods and plan your diet to include key nutrients, you can get all the nourishment you and your baby need, whether you're vegetarian or vegan. (Vegans do not eat any animal products including meat, fish, fowl, eggs, dairy, and honey.)If you're vegan, see our article on whether it's safe to eat a vegan diet during pregnancy.In some cases, you'll need to rely on fortified foods or supplements to make sure you're getting enough of what you need. Let your healthcare provider know about your diet at your preconception visit or your first prenatal visit. And always consult your doctor, midwife, or a dietitian before taking any supplements while you're pregnant.Along with a variety of fruit and vegetables (fresh, frozen, or canned) and whole grain products, you'll want to make sure you eat foods or take supplements that provide the following nutrients important for a healthy pregnancy.ProteinEat several servings of protein-rich foods each day. Good sources of vegetarian protein include eggs, dairy products, legumes, soy foods, nuts, seeds, and nut butters.Here are some ideas on how to work these foods into your diet:Add beans (such as kidney, black, or white), chickpeas, lentils, or tofu cubes to a saladHave a bean burritoSnack on a handful of almonds, walnuts, cashews, sunflower seeds, or roasted chickpeasSpread peanut or almond butter on whole grain bread or sliced applesSnack on yogurt or cottage cheeseSlice up a hard-boiled eggIronYour prenatal vitamin will likely provide some iron. But you'll also need to eat several servings of a variety of iron-rich foods every day. Good sources include:Iron-fortified breakfast cerealWhole grain or enriched foods, such as bread and pastaBeans and other legumesTofu, tempeh, and other soy-based foodsLeafy greens, such as spinach, kale, and chardAvoid having tea or coffee with your meals because these drinks contain tannins and polyphenols, which make it harder for your body to absorb iron from vegetables. Instead, have something that's rich in vitamin C, such as orange juice, tomato sauce, or broccoli, to help your body absorb the iron.You'll have a blood test early in your pregnancy to check your iron level. If yours is low, your healthcare provider may recommend that you take an iron supplement.ZincTry to get several servings of zinc-rich foods every day. Many foods that provide iron  such as fortified breakfast cereals, beans, soy foods, and whole grains  also provide zinc. Other good sources of zinc for vegetarians include nuts, seeds, wheat germ, and cheese.CalciumHave several servings of a variety of calcium-rich foods every day. Good sources include:Milk, cheese, and yogurtCalcium-fortified almond or soy milk, fruit juice, and breakfast cerealsWhite beans, blackstrap molasses, tahini, and calcium-set tofu. (To see if the tofu is calcium-set, check the list of ingredients for a calcium salt, such as calcium chloride or calcium sulfate.)Almonds or sesame seedsCertain green vegetables, including kale, collards, turnip greens, napa cabbage, broccoli, and bok choy. (Others, such as spinach, beet greens, and chard, contain calcium, but your body doesn't absorb the calcium from these vegetables as well.)Vitamin DThis vitamin helps your body absorb calcium. Cow's milk and some types of orange juice, cereal, and plant milk are fortified with vitamin D. Many prenatal supplements include vitamin D. If yours doesn't, you may want to consider taking a supplement.B12Vitamin B12 plays an important role in your baby's brain development. Eating several servings of dairy foods every day should provide you with enough, but if you are a vegetarian who limits or avoids dairy, you'll need to eat foods fortified with vitamin B12. These may include soy and other plant milks, breakfast cereals, and nutritional yeast. (Check for fortification on the product label.)If you don't eat dairy or fortified foods every day, and your prenatal supplement doesn't contain B12, you'll need to take a separate vitamin B12 supplement.IodineIodine is also important for your baby's brain development. Iodized salt, dried seaweed, cow's milk, and yogurt are good vegetarian sources of iodine. If you don't get a lot of these, check to make sure your prenatal vitamin contains iodine.DHADHA is an omega-3 fatty acid that promotes the development of your unborn baby's eyes and brain. It's found in fish, fish oil, and algae. Because it can be very difficult to obtain DHA from non-fish sources, you may want to take an omega-3 supplement derived from algae and suitable for vegetarians.NOTE: This article was reviewed by Reed Mangels, PhD, RD, LDN, adjunct associate professor in the nutrition department of the University of Massachusetts, Amherst.Show sources Hide sources Foster M et al. 2015.

Instead, take a close look at how and what you eat and figure out what's best for you and your baby. Keep in mind how much weight to gain during pregnancy as you make healthy food choices.Top tips for eating wellEat a good breakfast. It's true that the first meal of the day is the most important one: A breakfast with protein, fat, carbohydrates, and fiber will make you feel better the rest of the day.Eat small meals with snacks in between, rather than three big meals.Include protein at every meal and snack, and avoid foods with refined sugar or processed white flour. This helps stabilize your blood sugar levels and keeps hunger at bay.Work fruits and veggies into your meals in creative ways: Toss assorted chopped vegetables into your breakfast eggs, or sprinkle shredded zucchini or carrots into low-fat quick breads. Apple and cucumber slices make great additions to sandwiches. Add apple chunks, dried cranberries or currants, or chopped dried apricots to salads.Focus on folate: Pregnant women are advised to get 600 micrograms (mcg) of folic acid daily to help prevent neural tube defects. Many prenatal vitamins contain at least that much. (This is in addition to the folate from food, which your body doesn't absorb as well as the synthetic kind.)Some studies have found that plus-size women have lower blood folate levels than smaller women. Check with your doctor to see if you might need more than 600 mcg of folic acid during your pregnancy.Choose unsaturated good fats (olive, canola, peanut oils) over saturated fats (animal fats, whole-fat dairy, palm oil) and trans fats (shortening, margarine).Use a pregnancy food diary to keep track of your food and nutrient intake to make sure you're getting enough good stuff. It's also useful for tracking your mood and hunger levels so you can spot patterns you may need to change.Follow the seven principles to eating well during pregnancy.Discover 10 ""fast"" foods a pregnant woman could love  and five to avoid.Snack and drink ideasHere are some healthy ways to satisfy hunger pangs in between meals:An apple and a handful of almonds or walnutsA slice of whole grain toast spread with 1 tablespoon of almond butterA 6-ounce glass of skim milk and a banana1/2 cup of plain yogurt, sweetened with a touch of honeySix whole grain crackers with an ounce or two of low-fat cheeseA hard-boiled egg and some snackable veggies, such as celery, carrots, and peppersWatch what you drink  anything with refined sugar (juice drinks, lattes, and sodas) can make your blood sugar levels fluctuate and contribute to hunger and headaches. Even sugar-free soda can lead to weight gain, according to the American Diabetes Association, though experts don't know exactly why. Try these choices instead:Low-sodium vegetable juice (Drink only pasteurized juices  unpasteurized juices aren't safe for pregnant women. Make your own juice at home or stick to canned or bottled juices that have been pasteurized.)Sparkling water with a splash of pomegranate juice and a few sprigs of mintCarrot juice with a splash of orange juiceVanilla- or chocolate-flavored sugar-free soy milk over iceSkim milk over ice with a splash of sugar-free flavoring, like vanilla or hazelnut.(Note: Artificial sweeteners are fine in moderation, though it's probably a good idea to avoid saccharin, which crosses the barrier in your placenta that protects your baby.)If you have eating problemsCheck in with your healthcare provider, who can suggest modifications to your food routine and provide referrals to specialists who can support you and help you stay on track.

Breastfeeding and gestational diabetes,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-and-gestational-diabetes_8683.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI have gestational diabetes. Can I still breastfeed?Yes, and it benefits both you and your baby if you do.Breastfeeding can sometimes be a little harder for women who have had gestational diabetes because it can take longer for milk to come in. (Normally this happens after three or four days.)Having a high pre-pregnancy body mass index (BMI), needing insulin treatment for gestational diabetes, or having a cesarean birth also increase the chances of your milk coming in later than usual.Persistence is key: The more often you feed your baby, the more efficiently your body produces milk. Getting good support and advice in the first few days after delivery increases your chance of success, so talk to your healthcare provider about what help is available to you if you experience any problems.What are the benefits of breastfeeding after gestational diabetes?Breast milk is the ideal food for an infant because it's packed with the nutrients and antibodies your growing baby needs. And when you have gestational diabetes, there are additional benefits associated with breastfeeding.For example, sometimes gestational diabetes causes a baby to have low blood sugar (hypoglycemia) after birth. If a baby has low blood sugar, breastfeeding helps raise her blood sugar levels by providing a dose of glucose that's easily absorbed.Colostrum, the yellowish milk you produce in small amounts in the first few days after giving birth, helps your baby's digestive system to grow and mature, and is easy for your baby to digest.Breastfeeding can help with jaundice because it helps your baby's body clear the excess bilirubin more quickly. (Bilirubin is the pigment in your baby's blood that can cause her skin to look yellow.) Jaundice is more common in babies born to women who had gestational diabetes.Your baby also has a higher risk of developing type 2 diabetes in later life, but breastfeeding reduces that risk. Research is still ongoing, but being breastfed could also lower your baby's risk of becoming overweight (another risk factor for type 2 diabetes) as she gets older.There are also potential benefits for you, both in the short and long term. Breastfeeding may help you recover from gestational diabetes more quickly because the hormones that your body produces when you breastfeed may help balance your blood sugar.Breastfeeding appears to reduce the risk of developing type 2 diabetes after pregnancy and may also make it easier to maintain a healthy weight after having a baby.Can I still breastfeed if my baby needs special care?Yes, you can. If your baby needs extra care after birth, it may be tricky to breastfeed her at first. But there's no reason why you can't nurse successfully. (If your baby can't feed frequently in her first few days, you may need to express milk to keep up your supply.)If your newborn isn't able to latch on right away, you can still offer her drops of nutrient-rich colostrum. Your provider can advise you on the best way to give this to your baby.If you have problems breastfeeding, contact your healthcare provider or a lactation consultant.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2009.

The lowdown on children's vitamins,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-lowdown-on-childrens-vitamins_64355.bc,"Should I give my child a vitamin supplement?Experts disagree about whether a daily multivitamin or mineral supplement is necessary for all children. For example, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), advises giving your child a supplement only if your child's doctor recommends one. The AAP claims most children don't need supplements because so many common foods are fortified.On the other hand, the AAP acknowledges that taking a supplement won't do any harm as long as it doesn't exceed the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for any vitamin or mineral.Other experts believe that taking a daily supplement is a good way to compensate for any shortfalls in your child's diet.Most experts do agree that:Taking a daily supplement won't hurt as long as it doesn't exceed the RDA for any one vitamin or mineral.Some children  like vegetarians or those with food sensitivities  might need a daily supplement to meet the RDA for certain vitamins or minerals.Supplements are not a substitute for whole foods and should never be used to justify a poor diet. If your child isn't eating well, give him a multivitamin in addition to taking steps to improve his eating habits.The bottom line: If you're concerned that your child isn't meeting the requirements of a balanced diet listed in theU.S. Department of Agriculture's recommendations, a daily multivitamin or mineral supplement can't hurt.Should I give my child a vitamin if she's a picky eater?If you're concerned that your child's diet is lacking  because she won't put anything green in her mouth or because she goes on food jags for days  you might want to give her a supplement for your peace of mind.It provides a little extra insurance that she's getting what he needs, says dietitian Debby Demory-Luce.What kind of vitamin should I give my child?Any generic children's multivitamin (chewable or liquid) will do unless your child has special needs. For example, if your child is a vegetarian, you'll want to make sure that the supplement contains vitamins B12 and D, as well as riboflavin and calcium, which may be lacking in his diet. And if your doctor has determined that your child is anemic, she may recommend a supplement with a specific amount of iron.Also, children younger than 4 aren't able to grind foods when they chew, so give them liquid vitamins to prevent a choking hazard.Children often don't get enough Vitamin D, so the AAP recommends that most children  from babies to adolescents  take a supplement with 400 IU of vitamin D.Note that supplements often don't contain 100 percent of every vitamin and mineral, so you'll still want to make sure your child gets the needed vitamin or mineral from food sources too.If your child doesn't drink milk or eat enough dairy, for example, and only gets about 15 to 20 percent of the RDA for calcium from his supplement, then you'll need to find other food-based sources, such as calcium-fortified orange juice.When choosing a vitamin supplement for your child, read the label carefully. One national survey found that when young children who had diets low in certain nutrients were given vitamin supplements, some of the kids wound up getting more than the recommended upper limit of vitamin A, folic acid, and zinc. So it's a good idea to make sure the supplement you're giving your child isn't high in these nutrients unless your child's doctor says otherwise.Also, keep in mind that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) doesn't hold supplements to the same standards drugs must meet before they're manufactured, so quality and potency might vary between brands. (See our article onbuying supplementsfor guidance.)And don't substitute a vitamin drink for a vitamin supplement. Often vitamin drinks (including sports or energy drinks) contain caffeine and added sugar.Should I give my child more than one vitamin a day if his diet is especially bad one week?No. There's no reason to give your child more than the recommended daily dose (usually one pill a day). ""Some people think that a little is good but more is better,"" says Demory-Luce, ""but this is a dangerous way to approach vitamins.""Not only could it hurt your child, as with too much iron, but an overdose of certain vitamins could also prevent the absorption of others, creating a nutritional imbalance.What precautions should I take with vitamins?Vitamins are formulated to appeal to children and often resemble candy, so kids may eat several at a time if given the opportunity. But getting too much of certain vitamins and minerals (iron, in particular) could be dangerous, or even fatal.So treat vitamins as medicines. Make sure the caps are childproof, but don't depend on them  always keep vitamin bottles well out of the reach of your child.Dietitian Demory-Luce, mother of two, learned this lesson the hard way: ""My youngster got his hands on a bottle of vitamins, opened the safety top, and ate ten vitamins before I got to him,"" she says. ""Luckily, the vitamins didn't have iron in them."" Now she keeps vitamins locked away in a cabinet.To be safe, call poison control if you suspect that your child has taken vitamins on his own, even if they don't contain iron.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2013.

Iron-deficiency anemia in pregnancy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-deficiency-anemia-in-pregnancy_10414720.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineWhat is iron-deficiency anemia?Iron-deficiency anemia (IDA) is a type of blood disorder. The red blood cells in your body contain hemoglobin, which is responsible for carrying oxygen throughout your body. Your body needs iron to build enough healthy red blood cells and keep your hemoglobin at the right level. If your body lacks the right amount of iron, you could become anemic.As a woman, it's not unusual to have anemia, especially when you're of childbearing age. Iron deficiency is by far the most common cause of anemia in pregnancy and accounts for 75 to 95 percent of all cases.But it's not the only cause: You could also develop anemia from not getting enough folic acid or vitamin B12, by losing a lot of blood, or from having certain diseases or inherited blood disorders, such as sickle cell disease or thalassemia.Am I at risk of becoming anemic?Yes. Pregnancy increases your likelihood of becoming anemic.During pregnancy, the recommended amount of iron increases from 18 milligrams (mg) per day to 27 mg per day. You need extra iron to support additional red blood cells, the placenta, and your growing baby. Plus, the extra iron prepares your body for any blood loss that may occur when you give birth.But there are other factors outside pregnancy that increase your risk further, including:Heavy menstrual periodsA diet low in iron-rich foodsA diet low in vitamin-C-rich foods (which help with iron absorption)Eating too many foods or drinks that reduce iron absorption (like dairy products, foods containing soy, coffee and tea)A short gap between pregnanciesBeing younger than 20 when you become pregnantHaving a stomach or intestinal disease that affects how your body absorbs nutrientsHaving certain types of gastric bypass surgery, which alters the gut and absorption of nutrientsTaking medication that affects the way your body absorbs iron from foodLosing more blood than normal when giving birth previouslyWhat are the symptoms of iron-deficiency anemia?You might not have any symptoms, especially if your anemia is mild. Sometimes tiredness is the only symptom you notice. And it's common to feel tired during pregnancy, so many women don't realize that a lack of iron is making them feel more tired than normal.Fatigue and weakness are the most common symptoms of severe anemia. Other symptoms include:Shortness of breathDizzinessHeadachePale complexionPalpitationsChest painIrritability or poor concentrationAn unpleasant urge to move your legs during periods of inactivity (restless legs syndrome)Leg crampsCraving nonfood items (pica) or ice to suck or chew onPale lips, inner eyelids, and the inside of your mouthSpoon-shaped nailsGlossy tongueCracks in the corners of your mouthHow is anemia diagnosed?At your first prenatal appointment, your provider will evaluate your medical history, give you a physical exam, and test your blood for anemia.One of the blood tests you'll have is a complete blood count (CBC). Among other things, the CBC measures:The percentage of red blood cells in your bloodstream (hematocrit or Hct)The amount of hemoglobin (Hgb or Hb) in those red blood cellsBlood test resultsThe American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control give guidelines for diagnosing anemia. In the first and third trimesters, an Hct less than 33 percent and an Hgb level less than 11 grams (g) of hemoglobin per deciliter (dL) of blood suggest anemia. In the second trimester, the levels are a little lower: 32 percent Hct and 10.5 g/dL Hgb.Your provider may follow up your CBC with more tests to determine if iron deficiency is the cause of your anemia.Even if you're not anemic at the start of your pregnancy, it's not unusual to develop anemia as your pregnancy progresses, so you may be tested again later on.How will anemia affect my pregnancy?It's normal to feel worried about being diagnosed with anemia, but mild anemia that's diagnosed and treated early shouldn't pose a problem during your pregnancy. Most experts agree that anemia in pregnancy is more of a concern if it's severe, untreated, or lasts a long time.If your provider advises you take iron supplements, and you take them as prescribed, your condition should improve. If you have a more severe case of anemia, you may be treated with IV iron supplements, or possibly even a blood transfusion if your hemoglobin falls to 6 g/dL or less.If you have severe anemia, and it doesn't get better with initial treatment, your healthcare provider may refer you to a specialist for care. You may need to see a hematologist or a maternal-fetal medicine (MFM) specialist to figure out if another condition is causing your anemia.When you have a low level of iron, you may find yourself getting more tired or fatigued more easily during your pregnancy. Pregnancy can be exhausting anyway, so take extra care of yourself if you're feeling the added strain of having low iron.Will my baby be affected?A mild iron deficiency shouldn't affect your baby while you're pregnant. But research also suggests that mild iron-deficiency anemia that goes untreated and becomes more severe during pregnancy  especially in the first two trimesters  is linked to an increased risk of a baby being born with a low birth weight.Having severe iron-deficiency anemia may even increase the risk of stillbirth and newborn death.What can I do to have a healthy pregnancy?Let your provider know if you were diagnosed with iron-deficiency anemia before you became pregnant. That way, she can manage your condition and treat you effectively during preconception and throughout your pregnancy.As with any pregnancy, go to all your appointments, take your prenatal vitamins, and follow the advice of your healthcare provider. She may suggest that you take iron supplements or modify the foods you eat.You can improve your anemia by eating iron-rich foods, such as shrimp, beef, turkey, enriched breakfast cereals, beans, and lentils. Foods that enhance iron absorption are also beneficial to include, such as orange juice, strawberries, broccoli, grapefruit, and peppers.Avoid consuming too many foods or drinks that prevent your body from absorbing iron properly, such as dairy products, soy products, coffee, and tea. If you do consume these foods or drinks, it may be best to have them an hour before or two hours after an iron-rich meal.Also, when you take an iron supplement, have it with a small snack. Eating a large amount of food hinders iron absorption.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources AAP and ACOG. 2012.

Six healthy fixes for pregnancy junk food cravings,https://www.babycenter.com/0_six-healthy-fixes-for-pregnancy-junk-food-cravings_669.bc,"Many womencrave particular foods during pregnancy. And while some may pine for broccoli, bananas, or oatmeal, most probably have visions of cookies, chocolate, and ice cream dancing in their heads.If your desire for sugar and fat feels too powerful to resist, it's okay to indulge occasionally. But try to keep your cravings in check, so your growing baby gets all the nutrients he needs. (If you have type 1 or type 2 diabetes orgestational diabetes, follow the diet your provider recommended for you.)Here are six ways to control your cravings without feeling deprived:Eat breakfast every day. If you start the day well nourished, you'll be less susceptible to midmorning snack cravings. One winning combination: a hard-cooked egg, an orange, half a whole grain English muffin, and a glass of milk.Exercise regularly. Staying active is an excellent way to curb hunger and distract yourself from cravings.Regular exercise like a daily walk  is a great way to keep fit throughout pregnancy too.Pregnancy cravings and aversions (Mom confidential) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:00Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:00Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all pregnancy videosOutsmart that snack attack. Plan healthy snacks and have them ready to eat when hunger strikes. If you're suddenly starving with nothing in mind to eat, you might snack on things you don't need.Get emotional support. The hormonal roller coaster of pregnancy can make you more vulnerable to mood swings. You may turn to food when you might be better served by talking with a friend or taking a walk to ease stress or frustration.Train yourself to think small. Have a single scoop of ice cream rather than a whole bowl, or one square of chocolate instead of the entire bar.Substitute healthier stand-ins for your cravings. Look for ways to satisfy your craving and get the nutrients you and your baby need. Here are some ideas:Ice cream: Low-fat frozen yogurt or reduced-sugar, low-fat ice cream, sherbet, or sorbetSoda: Sparkling water with fruit juice or a squeeze of limePizza: Use whole wheat pitas for crust (or try recipes for whole grain pizza crusts made from brown rice and flaxseed) and top with roasted vegetables, tomato slices or marinara, and a little grated parmesanDoughnut orpastry: Whole grain cinnamon raisin toast or half a small whole grain bagel with strawberry cream cheese spreadSlice of cake: Low-fat banana nut or zucchini bread, or angel food cake topped with strawberriesSweetened, low-fiber cereals: Whole grain cereal or oatmeal topped with a little brown sugar and cinnamon, raisins, or cranberriesPotato chips: Baked potato or tortilla chips, popcorn (plain or sprinkled with seasoning), or pretzels. Split whole wheat pitas and cut into triangles, spread lightly with olive oil, sprinkle with herbs or spices, then bake. Make kale chips, crispy chickpeas, or roasted broccoli and cauliflower nuggets.Sour cream: Low-fat sour cream or plain yogurtHamburger: Grilled portobello burger on a whole wheat bun with barbecue sauce and a slice of provoloneFried chicken: Baked chicken coated with crunchy panko crumbs or crushed pretzelsFrench fries: Baked sweet potato or carrot ""fries""Sundae toppings: Berries, sliced bananas, or crushed pineapple in juice, topped with a sprinkle of coconut or chopped nutsCanned fruit in sugar syrup: Fresh fruit or unsweetened canned or frozen fruitLearn more:What causes cravings for nonfood itemsWhat eating for two really meansA pregnancy nutrition makeoverShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

Grains in your pregnancy diet,https://www.babycenter.com/0_grains-in-your-pregnancy-diet_1497.bc,"Why grains are so importantGrains (including whole wheat, oats, barley, corn, and rice, to name a few) are packed with nutrients such asiron, selenium, andmagnesium. They're also especially good sources of the B vitamins (including B1, B2,folic acid, and niacin) your growing baby needs for just about every part of his body. Grains supply energy for your baby's development and help the placenta grow.Be sure to look for ""whole grains,"" like whole wheat bread and brown rice, for example. These contain the most vitamins and nutrients. Most whole grains have plenty of fiber, too. The recommended amount of fiber during pregnancy is 28 grams a day, which helps prevent constipationandhemorrhoids.Government guidelines recommend that you make at least half the grains you eat each day whole grains. Products labeled ""refined""or ""enriched""aren't as beneficial to you or your baby.A note on shopping for whole grains: Many products now carry a label stating how many grams of whole grains it contains, and some have a whole grain stamp. If you don't see a label or a stamp, check the ingredients label. Whole grains are listed first.Some good grain choicesHere are some good grain options. Each is equal to one serving:1/2 cup cooked wheat, oatmeal, or barley cereal1 cup ready-to-eat whole grain cereal1.25-inch-square piece of cornbread1/2 whole wheat raisin or plain bagelOne slice of whole wheat bread1/2 whole grain hamburger or hot dog bun1/2 whole grain English muffin1/2 whole wheat pita pocket (6 inches across)1/2 cup cooked brown rice or wild rice1/2 cup cooked grain, such as millet, bulgur, or barleyTwo rice cakes1/2 cup cooked whole wheat noodles or pastaOne corn or whole wheat tortilla (6 inches across)One whole grain waffle or pancake (4 1/2 inches across)3 cups popcornEasy ways to add more grains to your daily dietTry a variety of grains for your morning cereal. Millet, oatmeal, and wheat all make good hot breakfasts.Substitute air-popped popcorn or whole grain crackers for chips.Experiment with whole grain noodles and pastas. Japanese soba noodles, for example, are made from buckwheat.Add cooked barley or another whole grain to quick breads, pancake or waffle batter, and soups. You can also shape them into patties and fry or bake them.Use leftover whole grains to make side salads. Simply add chopped veggies and a vinaigrette dressing.Replace some of the flour in your baked goods with whole grain flour, such as whole wheat, teff, triticale, spelt, or rye.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

(Some brands don't contain a significant amount of milk.)Use evaporated milk, which has double the calcium of regular milk, in cooked dishes like mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, cheese sauces and fruit smoothies, puddings, and custards.Make a yogurt dip for fresh vegetables.Top casseroles and soups with shredded cheese.Note: To avoid the bacterial infection listeriosis, stay away from unpasteurized milk and all foods made with it, such as soft cheeses like feta, Brie, Camembert, and blue-veined cheese.Can I eat dairy products even if I'm lactose intolerant?Even if you're lactose intolerant, you probably don't need to give up all dairy products. Research shows that most people who have trouble digesting lactose (the sugar in milk) can tolerate at least 1 cup of milk at mealtimes.Here are five ways to include dairy in your diet if you're lactose intolerant. (Be sure to check out this list of othergood sources of calcium.)Drink lactose-reduced milk or add over-the-counter enzyme drops (which help break down the lactose) to your milk. You can also take enzyme supplements (lactase) to help you digest the lactose more easily. (Be sure to check with your doctor or midwife before taking lactase or any other supplements.)Divide it up. Have 1/2 cup of milk (especially whole or 2 percent) four times a day with meals or snacks. The fat in the milk slows down digestion, making the lactose easier to digest.Drink milk with food. It's easier to digest when mixed with other foods, especially high-fiber foods.Choose low-fat or hard, aged cheese. More than half the lactose is removed from low-fat cheese during processing. Hard, aged cheeses have the lowest lactose content.Eat yogurt. This can be a great alternative to milk. Yogurt also contains active cultures, which are beneficial bacteria that help you digest lactose.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015. Nutrition during pregnancy.

How to use baby formula safely,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-use-baby-formula-safely_1334673.bc,"Preparing baby formula isn't hard, but it's important to mix it with water in the correct ratio so your baby gets the right amount of nutrients. It's also important to take precautions to protect him from foodborne illnesses because he doesn't have much immunity to germs just yet, especially as a newborn. Here's what you need to know.Check the expiration dateThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires manufacturers of infant formula to analyze each batch to verify nutrient levels and stamp every container with a ""use by"" date  just like the ones found on milk, eggs, and other perishables.When you're shopping with a fussy baby, it may be tempting to grab a can and run, but taking a few seconds to check the expiration date ensures safety and quality. If you buy in bulk, check the date every time you open a new can.If you have a newborn, you might want to wait a couple months to establish a feeding routine before stocking up. That way, you can figure out how much formula you'll be able to use before it expires.Also make sure the can isn't dented because this could mean the tin layer inside is cracked. This allows the liquid to come in contact with the steel, potentially causing rust and even a hole that could cause the contents to spoil.If you accidentally purchase expired formula, return the unopened container to the store and exchange it for a fresh one.Baby bottles and nipples buying guide (Before You Buy series) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 3:08Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -3:08Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosKeep formula cool but not frozenHeat and cold can degrade the nutrients in formula, so keep unopened liquid and powdered formula in a cool place. The optimum storage temperature is between 55 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, but make certain that it stays below 95 degrees and above freezing, or 32 degrees.Choose a cabinet or a shelf located away from a stove, oven, heating ducts, or hot water pipes. Don't leave cans in direct sunlight, and don't put them in the freezer.After you open a can of liquid formula, follow the storage directions on the can. Most manufacturers recommend storing formula in the can, covered, for 24 to 48 hours.It's best not to put powdered formula in the refrigerator or another damp place because humidity can cause the powder to clump, which may overconcentrate the formula.Finish up a can of powdered formula within a month after opening it.Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.Use this five-step checklist for preparing formula1. Wash your equipment well.Scrubbing with a bottle or nipple brush and warm, soapy water then rinsing well kills most germs. Some experts suggest sanitizing all bottles, nipples, measuring cups, spoons, and rings. Others say there's no need unless water safety in your area is questionable. Still others advise sterilizing feeding supplies if your baby is younger than 3 months old.Ask your baby's doctor if you should sterilize new bottles and supplies before using them for the first time, and ask for her advice on the best way to clean your supplies going forward. Keep in mind that heat can release the harmful chemical bisphenol A (BPA) from certain types of plastic. If you use polycarbonate bottles or bottles marked with the recycling number 7 or ""PC,"" don't boil them or put them in the dishwasher or microwave. Better yet, if you can, replace your polycarbonate bottles with ones made of a different material, such as BPA-free plastic, glass, or stainless steel.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) considers bottles labeled ""BPA-free"" and bottles made of the plastics polyethylene and polypropylene to be safe for babies, but some studies suggest chemicals leach regardless of the type of plastic.If you're concerned, don't put plastic bottles of any type in boiling water, the dishwasher, microwave, or any device that uses heat because high temperatures can release more chemicals from the plastic. Hand-wash plastic bottles with warm, soapy water, and rinse well. Or use bottles made of glass or stainless steel, which are safe to put in the dishwasher.It's a good idea to wash bottle supplies right after each feeding so the formula doesn't have a chance to dry out and stick to the inside. Disassemble all bottle parts so the surface areas get cleaned well.If you choose to sanitize, simply place the supplies in boiling water for about five minutes. You can also use a commercial sterilizer. Alternatively, rinsing nipples with a mixture of half water, half vinegar can help prevent fungal growth.Let the bottles and supplies air dry on a drying rack, or use a paper towel if you need them dry right away. (Don't use dishtowels because they can harbor bacteria.)If you're using sample nipples that you were given at the hospital or doctor's office, they come in sterilized packages and can be used directly out of the package. But they're meant for single use, so throw them away after using them once.2. Wash and dry the top of the formula can before opening it.This removes dust and liquid that may have spilled on it. Use a clean can opener, and wash it well before every use.3. Wash your hands.Before preparing formula, wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Dry your hands with a paper towel.4. Follow the preparation directions on the container exactly.Mixing instructions vary by manufacturer, and the ratio of water to formula depends on whether the formula is powder or liquid, so read the label carefully.Adding too little water can tax your baby's kidneys and cause dehydration. Adding too much water dilutes the calories and nutrients in the formula and can cause stunted growth and failure to thrive if it happens regularly.For better accuracy, use a standard measuring cup instead of the lines on your baby's bottle.5. Use clean, safe water.If you're using powdered or liquid concentrate formula, be sure to mix it with water that's clean and safe. The AAP says it's fine to use tap water as long as your local health department says it's safe to drink. Run tap water for a minute or two until it's cold to reduce lead or other contaminants. If you have a private well, get the water tested before using it for your baby's formula.To sterilize water, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends bringing water to a rolling boil for just one minute then letting it cool for no longer than 30 minutes before mixing with the formula. (Boiling water for an extended time can concentrate minerals and impurities.)Note that bottled water isn't necessarily sterile, and neither is water that's been run through a filter. Filters (in pitchers or on faucets) that aren't changed often enough can harbor bacteria. You can buy sterilized bottled water, but make sure the label specifies that.Also talk with your healthcare provider about the water quality in your area. Ask her whether she thinks it's necessary to boil the water for your baby's formula.Health experts say it's okay to use fluoridated water to prepare formula. But keep in mind that babies who drink formula mixed with fluoridated water are at greater risk of developing fluorosis. This condition doesn't affect dental health, but it can cause small white spots on your baby's teeth that are purely cosmetic. If you're concerned, talk to your baby's doctor or dentist.Mix what you can use within 24 hours and toss leftoversBased on how much formula your baby needs, mix only what you think you'll use in the next 24 hours. Once you've mixed powdered or liquid concentrate formula, refrigerate it immediately. Don't let it cool outside the refrigerator first, and use it within 24 hours.If your baby doesn't finish a bottle of formula within one hour, toss out the remainder. Bacteria from his mouth can seep into the bottle, contaminate the formula, and make your baby sick if he drinks it later.Tip: To prevent waste and save time, mix a large batch of formula in the morning and divide it into 3- or 4-ounce bottles that you can refrigerate and use throughout the day.Keep it coolRoom temperature is the perfect climate for breeding germs in formula, so feed warmed formula to your baby right away. Don't heat it up ahead of time, and toss any formula that has been sitting at room temperature for an hour or more.If you're taking your baby's bottle ""to go,"" store it in an insulated lunch pack, ideally with an ice pack. If that's not possible, bring a brand that's ready to use.Learn the symptoms of foodborne illnessThe most common symptoms of a foodborne illness are vomiting and diarrhea. If your baby has these symptoms, call his doctor right away. Foodborne illnesses can be very serious in babies, leading to dehydration, kidney damage, and, sometimes, even death.Report problems immediatelyOccasionally infant formula is recalled because of potential contamination, so it's a good idea to keep up with product recalls.If you have a complaint or concern about infant formula, especially if you suspect formula has made your baby sick, you can report the problem online to the FDA's MedWatch adverse event reporting program. Have the formula container handy so you can report essential information such as the manufacturer's name and the product's expiration date.Also notify the formula manufacturer about any problems. Look for a toll-free customer service number on the label.Show sources Hide sources AAP. Undated. Children and foodborne illness.

How to eat when you're trying to conceive,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-eat-when-youre-trying-to-conceive_1460692.bc,"If you're trying to get pregnant, practicing good eating habits now can help you have a healthy pregnancy once you conceive.""What you eat affects everything from your blood to your cells to your hormones,"" says Cynthia Stadd, a nutrition specialist at the Berkley Center for Reproductive Wellness in New York City.But no matter how balanced your diet is, it's still important to take prenatal vitamins to reduce the risk of having a baby with neural tube defects. Most experts recommend that all women start taking folic acid at least a month before trying to get pregnant.Read on for more tips about eating a healthy diet while trying to conceive.Curb caffeineIt's unclear whether caffeine can affect fertility. There's some evidence that very high consumption  more than 500 milligrams a day, or about three to four 8-ounce cups of coffee depending on the strength of the brew  might interfere with fertility. But experts generally agree that low to moderate caffeine consumption (less than 300 milligrams a day, or about two 8-ounce cups of coffee) shouldn't make it harder for you to get pregnant.What does your OB-GYN want you to know before getting pregnant?

Fruits and vegetables deliver a wide variety of vitamins and minerals, and getting enough of certain nutrients is especially important before you conceive.For example, veggies like spinach, romaine lettuce, asparagus, and broccoli are high in the B vitamin folate. (Folic acid is the synthetic form.) Eating foods rich in folate during preconception and pregnancy can help prevent neural tube birth defects, such as spina bifida. Produce that's high in vitamin C  such as citrus fruit, strawberries, broccoli, and tomatoes  can help your body absorb iron more easily, and iron is an important mineral for women who become pregnant. (See ""Pump up your iron intake"" below.)In general, choose fruits and vegetables in a range of colors to get the most nutritional bang for your buck. (Eating a produce ""rainbow"" gives you a wider variety of nutrients.) Choose fishSeafood is the best source of omega-3 fatty acids, and according to some scientists, these essential fats may have a positive effect on fertility. Research suggests that a diet rich in omega-3 fatty acids may help regulate ovulation, improve egg quality, and even delay aging of the ovaries.Omega-3s are also important for a baby's brain and eye development and could have many other pregnancy-related benefits. These include lowering your risk ofpreterm birth, reducing your chance of preeclampsia, and easingdepression.On the other hand, you've probably also heard that some types of fish contain contaminants such as mercury. In high doses, this metal is harmful to a baby's developing brain and nervous system.The good news is that not all fish contain a lot of mercury. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) says that women trying to conceive can safely eat up to 12 ounces (roughly two or three servings) a week of fish like canned light tuna, salmon, shrimp, cod, tilapia, and catfish.However, the FDA advises limiting white (albacore) tuna and completely avoiding fresh or frozen swordfish, tilefish, king mackerel, and shark because these have the highest mercury levels.You can take fish oil supplements if you don't like seafood, but first talk to your doctor about which brand to buy and how much you should take.Read our article oneating fish when you're trying to conceivefor more advice on mercury and omega-3s.Pump up your iron intakeFill your body's iron reserves before you get pregnant, especially if your periods are heavy. According to Sam Thatcher, a reproductive endocrinologist and author ofMaking a Baby: Everything You Need to Know to Get Pregnant, ""Bleeding every month is a constant source of iron depletion.""Make sure to get enough iron now  once you're expecting, it's difficult for your body to maintain its iron level because your developing baby uses up your stores of the mineral. (Pregnant women need double the amount of iron they needed before pregnancy.)Too little iron at conception not only can affect your baby, it can also put you at risk for iron-deficiency anemia during pregnancy and after you give birth (especially if you lose a lot of blood during delivery). Anemia causes your red blood cells to fall below normal and saps your energy.If you don't eat much red meat, or if you follow a vegetarian or vegan diet, your healthcare provider may recommend that you take a prenatal vitamin containing extra iron. And to be on the safe side, ask your healthcare provider to test you for anemia at your preconception checkup. Eat whole grainsA woman trying to conceive should eat as many nutrient-rich foods as possible, and whole grains are a great place to start, says nutrition specialist Stadd.The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food guidelines recommend that you make at least half of the grains you eat each day whole grains (such as bran cereal, oatmeal, brown rice, or whole wheat bread). Refined carbohydrates (like white bread, pasta, and white rice) won't directly lower your chance of getting pregnant, but they do shortchange your body because the refining process strips grains of key nutrients such as fiber, some B vitamins, and iron.Note: If you havepolycystic ovary syndrome(PCOS), the most common cause of infertility in women, pay extra attention to the types of carbs you eat. PCOS is a hormonal imbalance that can get worse when insulin levels in the bloodstream surge, and refined carbohydrates are a main cause of insulin spikes.Mark Leondires, fertility specialist and medical director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of Connecticut, explains that when women with PCOS eat too many refined carbohydrates, insulin flows into the blood, feeds back to the ovaries, and can lead to irregular ovulation.Avoid alcoholAn occasional beer or glass of wine probably won't hurt your odds of conceiving, but having two or more drinks a day can. Moderate drinking can also increase your risk of miscarriage. You may want to skip alcohol completely when you're trying to conceive because it can be hard to tell exactly when you get pregnant, and alcohol can harm a developing baby.For nonalcoholic alternatives, see our list of thebest ""virgin"" drinks.Be aware of listeriaListeriais a bacterium that can contaminate lunchmeats, soft cheeses, and unpasteurized dairy products. Pregnant women are more likely than other healthy adults to get sick from eating contaminated food, and the infection caused by listeria (listeriosis)can cause amiscarriageearly in the first trimester  possibly before you even know you're pregnant.To kill listeria, heat high-risk foods in the microwave until they're steaming hot. To reduce bacteria growth on leftovers, set the refrigerator's temperature to 40 degrees or less. Toss any food that's been at room temperature for more than two hours.Do not eat these foods:raw fish and sushi, refrigerated smoked seafood (like lox), soft cheesemade from unpasteurized (raw) milk, other unpasteurized dairy products, and refrigerated pt or meat spreads. (Canned or shelf-stable spreads are safe to eat.) Choose other proteinsProtein is a critical part of a healthy diet, but according to the USDA, many Americans rely too heavily on beef, pork, and chicken to get their daily amount. In a study of 18,555 women, experts at Harvard Medical School found that those who included one daily serving of vegetable protein  such as nuts, beans, peas, soybeans or tofu  were less likely to have infertility due to ovulation problems.More research is needed on the link to fertility, but because vegetable proteins are usually lower in fat and calories than steak or fried chicken, including them in your meal plans is both good for you and a great way to maintain a healthy weight.To get a personalized nutrition plan that includes the amount of protein, grains, and produce you should eat daily, try the USDA's SuperTracker tool.What about hisdiet?When it comes to fertility and diet, men don't get a free pass. Lisa Mazzullo, an ob-gyn and assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago, recommends that fathers-to-be take a daily multivitamin that contains zinc and selenium for at least three months before conception. Studies suggest these minerals aid in healthy sperm development.Why start so early? The sperm your partner ejaculates today was actually created more than two months ago. It takes about 74 days for sperm to fully develop and benefit from the supplementation.""Genetic preparation is going on during sperm development, so that's pretty heavy stuff,"" says Amy Ogle, a registered dietitian in San Diego, California, and coauthor ofBefore Your Pregnancy: A 90-Day Guide for Couples on How to Prepare for a Healthy Conception.Learn more:Dietary changes men can make to boost fertilityFolic acid: Why you need it before and during pregnancyPrenatal vitamins: Why they're so importantEating fish when you're trying to conceive: How to avoid mercury and still get your omega-3sUSDA SuperTracker tool: Get your personalized nutrition planShow sources Hide sources ACOG. 2015.

How to buy baby formula,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-buy-baby-formula_1334669.bc,"I'm bottle-feeding my baby. Which formula is best?It's easy to feel overwhelmed in the formula aisle. Choosing the right nourishment for your baby is a pretty weighty decision, and there are lots of options.When choosing formula, consider the form it comes in, the type of protein and carbohydrate it provides, and what other ingredients are included. In the end, you'll be able to choose the formula that is best for your baby and your family's lifestyle.What are the different forms of formula?Formulas come in three forms: Ready-to-use, liquid concentrate, and powdered.Ready-to-use formula is undoubtedly the most convenient  no mixing or measuring required, just open and serve. It's the kind of formula that hospitals often give to newborns. It's hygienic and especially helpful when you don't know whether you'll have access to safe water.The convenience of ready-to-use formula comes at a price  this kind costs about 20 percent more per ounce than powdered formula. The containers also take up more storage space in your cupboard and more space in the landfill (unless you can recycle the containers).Once opened, ready-to-use formula has a short lifespan  it must be used within 48 hours. Also, because liquid formula is often darker than powdered formula, many moms complain that it's more likely to stain clothes.Liquid concentrate formula requires mixing equal parts of water and formula. Compared to ready-to-use formula, concentrate is less expensive and takes up less storage space. Compared to powdered formula, it's a little easier to prepare but more expensive.Powdered formula is the most economical and the most environmentally friendly formula option. It takes up the least amount of space in transport, in your pantry, and in your trash can.Powdered formula takes more time to prepare than other types of formula, and you must follow the directions exactly, but it has a one-month shelf life after the container has been opened. As with liquid concentrate formula, you can mix up just the right amount  as much or as little as you want  whenever you need it. This is especially helpful if you're a breastfeeding mom who may only need a supplemental bottle occasionally. What are the different types of formula?There's a formula to suit every baby's needs. But it's best to stick with one type and resist the urge to switch, even if your baby seems like he's not digesting the formula well at first.Common problems  like spitting up, gas, and colic  are usually unrelated to your baby's diet. Most of the time, these problems have to do with your baby's immature gastrointestinal tract, not what he's eating.So try out a particular type of formula for at least a couple weeks. After that, if your baby's still having trouble, talk to his doctor about switching.Cow's-milk-based formula: Most formula available today has cow's milk as the main ingredient. The overwhelming majority of formula-fed and formula-supplemented babies do best with this type of formula because it has just the right balance of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. The milk protein in formula is significantly altered to make it easier to digest. Your baby won't be able to digest regular cow's milk until after his first birthday.Partially and extensively hydrolyzed formulas: In these formulas, the protein is broken down into small parts (partially hydrolyzed) or even smaller parts (extensively hydrolyzed) that are easier for your baby to digest than larger protein molecules. Your baby may need a hydrolyzed formula if he has a milk protein allergy or trouble absorbing nutrients (a common problem for preemies). The doctor may also suggest trying a hydrolyzed formula if your baby has a skin condition such as eczema.Soy-based formula: These formulas are made with a plant protein that, like the protein in cow's milk, is modified for easy digestion. Although soy-based formulas are a good option for vegan families, there are only a few medical reasons for using them. These include:Transient lactose deficiency: a temporary lactose intolerance caused by a gastrointestional infectionImmunoglobulin E (IgE)-associated allergy to cow's milk: an allergy to cow's milk protein that causes immediate symptoms, including wheezing, runny nose, hives, and rashes. Many babies with IgE-associated milk allergy are also allergic to soy protein, so don't give soy formulas to your child unless your doctor recommends it.Galactosemia: a rare inherited disorder in which the body is unable to break down a milk sugar (galactose) to produce energyCongenital lactase deficiency: an extremely rare inherited disorder in which a baby is born with very little or none of the enzyme that breaks down the sugar lactose found in milk, causing life-threatening lactose intolerance symptomsLactose-free formula: A case of lactose intolerance or an inability to digest lactose  the sugar naturally found in milk  is rare. If your baby is lactose intolerant, his doctor may recommend a soy formula or another formula in which the lactose is replaced with a different sugar, such as corn syrup.Formula for premature and low-birth-weight babies: These formulas often contain more calories and protein, as well as a more easily absorbed type of fat called medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). How much MCT is in these formulas varies by brand. Your baby's doctor will help you select the one that will help your baby gain just the right amount of weight.Human milk fortifier: This product is used to enrich the nutrition of breastfed babies who have special needs. Some are designed to be mixed with breast milk, and some are meant to be fed alternately with breast milk.Metabolic formula: If your baby has a disease that requires very specific nutrition, he may need one of these specially developed formulas.Organic formula: According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), no research to date has proven organic milk to be healthier for children than regular milk. Since standard formula is based on milk, parents may want to consider whether organic formula is worth the higher price.Other specialty formula: New formulas come out all the time and are marketed to moms to help babies with digestion to relieve problems such as colic or acid reflux. These formulas have a protein ratio similar to breast milk and vary slightly in composition from regular formula  but some experts say they may not be any better.""More often than not, specialty formulas are substantially more expensive and not significantly different in key nutritional value, says KT Park, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Stanford's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. ""Babies undergo tremendous adaptation of their gastrointestinal tract during the first six months of life, which is normal. There are very few scenarios in which infants would require the more expensive formulas.""If you think your child might benefit from a specialty formula, ask your child's doctor about it before you stock up. How do formulas differ?There are five main components to formula: Carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals, plus other nutrients in smaller quantities. What makes one brand of formula different from the next are the specific carbohydrates and proteins as well as any additional ingredients. For example, casein and whey are two kinds of cow's milk proteins found in various proportions in different brands of cow's-milk-based formula.It's very easy to get confused by all of the items listed on the ingredient label. Below is a guide through the maze of ingredients and a comparison to the ones found in breast milk.Carbohydrate: Lactose is the main carbohydrate in both breast milk and formulas made from cow's-milk. Corn maltodextrin is sometimes used as a secondary source of carbohydrate in formula. Lactose-free, soy, and special formulas contain one or more of the following carbohydrates: Sucrose, corn maltodextrin, modified cornstarch, or corn syrup solids.Protein: Breast milk contains about 60 percent whey and 40 percent casein. Most formulas have similar protein content. Others contain 100 percent whey.Partially hydrolyzed formulas are not hypoallergenic  don't use one if your baby has a protein allergy, or even if you suspect she may have one. However, compared to standard cow's-milk formula, partially hydrolyzed whey formulas have been shown in studies to reduce eczema.Extensively hydrolyzed formulas contain proteins that are completely broken down into their building blocks (amino acids), which allow them to be easily absorbed. These formulas are considered hypoallergenic and are used for babies who have a protein allergy.Soy formulas contain soy protein isolate  a processed soybean ingredient that is almost pure protein (at least 90 percent). Some brands use partially hydrolyzed soy protein (protein is partially broken down) to allow easier digestion.Fat: Breast milk contains a blend of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated fat. Formulas use a variety of oils to match the fat makeup of breast milk. They include soy oil, coconut oil, palm or palm olein oil, and high oleic sunflower oil.Although palm and palm olein oil is widely used, research has shown that these fats can reduce absorption of fat and calcium. This would mean that your baby would not absorb as much fat and calcium as she would from a formula that doesn't contain this oil.Medium-chain triglycerides require less effort to digest and are more easily absorbed. They're used in special formulas for premature infants and for infants who have trouble digesting or absorbing nutrients.The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the addition of two long-chain fatty acids to formula: DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and ARA (arachidonic acid), which are now standard ingredients in formula. Both of these substances are found in breast milk when the mother's diet is adequate, and both are important for brain and vision development. Babies get DHA and ARA from their mother during the third trimester, but the transfer is cut short when a baby is born prematurely. All babies need a steady supply of both substances throughout their first year.Numerous studies support the supplementation of formula with DHA and ARA. One, a report published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed that full-term infants fed DHA- and ARA-supplemented formula had significantly clearer vision than infants who did not receive the supplements. And a study published in The Journal of Pediatrics states that DHA and ARA enhanced both cognitive and physical growth in preterm infants.There aren't any long-term studies confirming the safety of these substances, although there's no evidence suggesting that these additives are harmful to babies, either. The AAP hasn't taken a position on whether these fatty acids should be added to formula, but the organization does point out that they're believed to be important in brain and eye development.Vitamins and minerals: Most words on the ingredient label describe vitamins and minerals. These words can be hard to figure out  ferrous sulfate is iron, for example. Sodium ascorbate is vitamin C, and calcium pantothenate is vitamin B5.The AAP recommends that all healthy babies who aren't breastfed exclusively be given iron-fortified formula until their first birthday. It's important that babies receive the minimum recommended amount of iron (0.27 milligrams [mg] daily for infants 0 to 6 months; 11 mg daily for babies 7 to 12 months) to prevent iron-deficiency anemia.Iron is vital to the blood's ability to circulate oxygen, which all of the body's cells need to function properly. Studies have shown that getting enough iron in the first year of life is important for brain development. A baby's iron stores are established in the third trimester, so premature babies need extra help in getting plenty of iron.Most formulas contain at least 4 mg of iron per liter, although ""low-iron"" formulas are still on the shelves. These were developed years ago in response to the misconception that iron causes constipation. The AAP would like these low-iron formulas to be discontinued or labeled as nutritionally inadequate.Nucleotides: These are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, naturally present in breast milk. They have several functions and may aid in immune system development. Different brands of formula have different amounts of nucleotides added.Rice starch: Rice starch is added to ""anti-regurgitation"" formulas. Your doctor may recommend this type of formula to alleviate your baby's acid reflux.Dietary fiber: Soy fiber is added to soy formula for the temporary treatment of diarrhea. The only formula containing fiber is Similac Expert Care for Diarrhea, which is clinically shown to reduce the duration of diarrhea.Amino acids: Amino acids such as taurine, methionine, and carnitine are added to soy formulas, and sometimes to cow's-milk formulas, to match the amino acids in breast milk.Probiotics and prebiotics: Probiotics are a type of live bacteria that may help prevent intestinal infections and inflammation. Prebiotics boost the numbers of probiotic bacteria in the gut.The AAP says some studies show probiotics and prebiotics can play a role in keeping your child's digestive system healthy but they can also be unsafe for babies with compromised immune systems and certain other medical conditions, so it's best to check with your baby's doctor before using these formulas. Any benefit from probiotics and prebiotics goes away once your baby stops using them. Are generic brands nutritionally adequate?Generic brands of formula must meet the FDA's requirements for nutrients in formula, so in many instances, the only difference between generic and brand name is the price.Whether you're buying generic or name brand, take a minute to look at the label before you purchase the formula. Specific ingredients do vary from brand to brand, and this can make a difference to your baby.Can I make my own formula?Doctors strongly advise against it. If you made your own formula, it would be impossible to include all the ingredients in the right amounts for your baby. Homemade formula could lead to failure to gain weight, malnourishment, or even death.What about adding cereal or milk to my baby's formula?Never add any ingredients  including vitamins, cereal, fatty acids, olive oil, regular cow's milk, or anything else  to your baby's formula unless your doctor recommends it. Formula is a carefully developed substance with precise amounts of dozens of nutrients. Adding anything to formula could jeopardize your baby's health.Olive oil, for example, can lead to permanent lung damage and even death, because of the danger of inhaling the oil into the lungs when spitting up. Because cow's milk is so hard for babies to digest, never mix cow's milk with formula or give it to your baby straight until he's at least 1 year old. And adding breast milk to formula is a waste of breast milk if your baby doesn't drink the entire bottle.What if I'm still not sure which formula is right for my baby?If you've decided to feed your baby formula and you're still baffled by the many options available, or you're considering switching formulas, talk with your baby's doctor. He'll consider your baby's health, age, and nutritional needs and make an appropriate recommendation.He can also monitor your baby's reactions and investigate any symptoms. Don't try to diagnose an allergy or sensitivity on your own. You could miss a serious underlying condition or prevent your baby from getting adequate nutrition.If you'd like to learn more, visit the FDA pages on infant formula.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Baby food revolution: New rules for feeding your baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-food-revolution-new-rules-for-feeding-your-baby_10320504.bc,"Many babies areready for solid foodsby the time they're 4 to 6 months old, and parents often turn to such traditional first foods as infant cereals and otherbland fare. Plain food isn't necessarily bad for babies, but too much of it can deprive them of important nutrients and may make them less likely to accept different textures and flavors.So how do you get your baby to eat a variety of food from an early age? Here's the exciting new thinking on what to feed your baby.Rethink what you've heard about food allergiesExperts used to recommend waiting to introducecommonly allergenic foods, including eggs, tree nuts, peanuts, fish, and shellfish, until after your baby's first birthday. But recent research suggests that introducing them when your baby is between 4 and 6 months old may actually help prevent food allergies.If your baby is at least 4 months old and shows signs of readiness for solids, the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology recommends starting with a few nonallergenic foods  such as pureed veggies, fruits, meats, or infant cereal  to see if they cause any reactions. If they don't, you can move on to more allergenic foods, such as eggs and fish. Be sure to wait three to five days before introducing the next new food.7 signs your baby is ready for solid foods Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:57Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:57Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Watch for these signs that usually indicate when babies are ready to try their first food. See all videosYou may also need to take extra precautions in some situations. If your baby has a sibling or a parent with an allergic condition (including hay fever, eczema, allergic asthma, or food allergy), he's more likely to have a food allergy. In this case, consult with your baby's doctor or an allergist before starting solids.Also check with the doctor before starting solids or introducing new foods if your baby has any of these risk factors:A sibling with a peanut allergyModerate to severe eczema despite following a doctor's treatment planA diagnosed food allergy or a previous immediate allergic reaction to a foodA positive result on an allergy blood test for a food that your baby has not yet tried (Blood tests for food allergies are usually done only for children with a history of an allergic reaction.)Read our article on food allergies to find out more.No need to avoid spices and seasoningsWhile babies throughout the world are dining on complex, flavorful cuisine, many babies in the United States are gumming plain, tasteless mush. The reasons we continue to serve babies bland food are open to debate, but one thing is certain  they're not based on research.""The idea that babies should eat only bland food is a myth that has somehow become our cultural norm,"" says Seattle pediatrician Susanna Block. ""There's absolutely no science behind it.""In other words, a culinary walk on the wild side won't hurt your baby in the slightest.5 tips to develop healthy eating habits Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:05Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:05Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosAnd breastfed babies have actually walked that way already: Breast milk takes on the flavors of the food the mother eats, Block explains. So if you dine at your favorite Indian restaurant and then nurse, your baby will also enjoy the taste of an Indian meal. ""To go from diverse, flavorful breast milk to bland, processed foods seems like a step backward,"" she says.So toss some rosemary in with that squash, liven up that chicken with a dash of cumin, and give those mashed potatoes a kick with a blend of paprika and parsley. You may be surprised by your baby's reaction.Contrary to popular belief, you don't need to banish hot spices from the highchair tray either. ""I know of no evidence that spicy food has a negative impact on babies. The degree of spiciness is a cultural thing,"" says pediatrician Frank Greer of the Department of Nutritional Sciences at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.Of course you'll want to steer clear of anything that could irritate your baby's skin or mouth (so no habaneros yet), but there's no harm in letting your baby try mildly or moderately spicy food. For example, milder chiles, such as Anaheims and poblanos, add flavor without causing pain. If anyone raises an eyebrow, just say that babies in other parts of the world thrive on spicy food.""Spicy chickpea curry with lots of ginger was one of my son's favorite finger foods,"" says Jennifer Pinarski of Winnipeg, Manitoba.Cooking with herbs and spices is a great way to expand your baby's palate, but skip the sugar and salt when preparing food for your little one. Not only are they unhealthy for her, but they can also lead to poor eating habits and health problems, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease in childhood and later in life.Give your little one homemade food for babies and for grown-ups""Homemade baby food"" sounds daunting, but it's surprisingly easy and doesn't require a nutrition degree, gourmet cooking skills, or fancy equipment. Making baby food can be as simple as mashing up a banana or avocado with a fork, squashing canned beans together with some garlic, or pureeing veggies steamed with spices.And as long as you're making something healthy, your baby can eat the same food you do  no need to make separate meals! Just use a blender, food processor, or hand grinder to make food the right consistency for your baby.Make your own informed decisions about organics""There's a lot of confusion when it comes to organics because there's no conclusive evidence that they're healthier than conventional foods,"" says dietitian and mom Jodi Greebel of New York. And there's conflicting evidence about whether pesticides andhormonesin conventional foods are harmful.""But the general feeling is that anything harmful will have a stronger effect on babies because of their small size  bad substances won't be as diluted as they are in an adult.""Some studies suggest a link between pesticide exposure and cancer as well as developmental problems in children, including attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and poor intellectual development. But the short-term and long-term effects of pesticide exposure are still poorly understood, and experts disagree on just how concerned parents should be. In deciding whether to feed your baby all, some, or no organic food, consider what works for your family andyourbudget.The organic factor also matters more with some foods than others. For example, apples, spinach, and strawberries have the highest pesticide residue levels. On the other hand, sweet corn, cabbage, and avocados tend to have relatively low levels. The nonprofitEnvironmental Working Groupranks 48 fruits and vegetables from best to worst in terms of pesticide residue.Greebel and Block also recommend buying organic meat and poultry when possible.""Both come from animals that were not treated with antibiotics."" says Greebel.Keep in mind that conventional meat and poultry can still be free of antibiotics and hormones. The federal government prohibits the use of hormones when raising hogs and poultry, so just check packages of beef for a label like ""no hormones administered,"" and check meat and poultry products for labels indicating that no antibiotics were added. Visit the United States Department of Agriculture's website for more information about meat and poultry labeling terms.Whatever you decide, remember that general good nutrition trumps organics. ""The most important thing is to provide your baby with a wide variety of healthy foods,"" says Greebel.Expand your baby's tastesAlthough consistency in everything from bedtime to discipline is a hallmark of sound parenting advice, a little inconsistency at mealtime can be a wonderful thing. Changing up the menu broadens your baby's palate and helps to ensure good nutrition, especially when it comes to produce. (For ideas to get you started, check out these experts' suggestions foradventurous first foods.)Often this means heaving ourselves out of a well-worn food rut. Stuck on sweet potatoes? Shake things up with some steamed beets. Smashed peas and carrots every night? Consider pureed brussels sprouts instead. Oat cereal overload? Try quinoa.""I gave my baby quinoa cooked in vegetable broth,"" says dietitian Karin Hosenfeld of North Dallas Nutrition. ""It's loaded with heart healthy protein.""Or instead of chicken, chicken, and more chicken, consider serving your baby pureed duck leg. ""It's easy to cook and tastes great,"" says food writer Matthew Amster-Burton.Find out which rules for feeding solids still applyIdeas about what to feed your baby may be changing, but many recommendations for introducing solids and encouraging your baby to eat well still stand.

Picky eaters: The Stuck-in-a-Rut Child,https://www.babycenter.com/0_picky-eaters-the-stuck-in-a-rut-child_10331710.bc,"When faced with a picky eater, how do you ensure your child gets the nutrients he needs without a fight? Our food experts offer strategies for your stuck-in-a-rut child.See all eight picky eaters hereThe Stuck-in-a-Rut ChildThe dilemma: Your kid will only eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches, every meal, every day. Or he's mainly subsisting on macaroni and cheese  three weeks and counting.The nutritional concern: Even if what your child is obsessing over is healthy, it's wise to offer a variety of foods to meet all of your child's dietary needs  and to encourage him to expand his horizons on the food front. Though chances are, his food obsession isn't a nutritious one.Missy Chase Lapine, mother of two and author of The Sneaky Chef: Look for a quick fix until it passes. My daughter went on a ranch dressing bender. But traditional ranch dressing is full of unhealthy fat and calories. So I slowly cut the salad dressing with plain yogurt  full of healthy calcium and probiotics (beneficial bacteria)  until her dressing was about half ranch, half plain yogurt. If it's the PB&J dilemma and your kid does crunchy peanut butter, add some wheat germ or ground flax seed. Or serve the same thing with a twist, like peanut butter and jelly muffins.Ann Cooper, nutrition expert who revamps school cafeterias around the country and coauthor of Lunch Lessons: It's all about the choices you give your child. If we have a kid who goes to the salad bar every day, we don't have a problem with that, because we offer local, whole, fresh food to choose from. If you offer a range of nutritious choices  and who's in charge here?  then this isn't an issue.Jessica Seinfeld, mother of three and author of Deceptively Delicious: Read Bread and Jam for Frances, by Russell Hoban, to your kids. It's about a badger who finally admits that there can indeed be too much of a good thing  namely bread and jam.Vicki Lansky, mother of two, grandmother of three, and author of Feed Me I'm Yours: As long as your kid is thriving  and the food jag is a reasonably healthy one  then relax. In some cultures, the diet is very limited. Variety is a relatively new thing.Jennifer Iserloh, private chef and author Secrets of a Skinny Chef: If your kid is a one-noter, just try to make it as healthy as it can be. Is that peanut butter low in fat and free of sugar and preservatives? Serve it on whole grain bread and find a fruit spread with no additives. It's okay if kids are a bit obsessed, as long as what they eat isn't loaded with fat, sugar, and additives  so read labels. You can also try doing a half-and-half combo: Something familiar and favorite with something new and different. Gently introduce new things. Sneaky Chef Bonus BurgersBy Missy Chase LapineIn this version of the traditional hamburger, we managed to sneak in a good amount of nutrient-packed pureed blueberries and spinach per ounce of beef. The familiar taste of ketchup helps override any detectable foreign flavors, and I have yet to find anyone who noticed anything unusual about this burger.Ingredients:1 large egg1/4 cup Purple Puree (recipe below)3 tablespoons ketchup1 teaspoon salt1/4 cup fresh whole wheat bread crumbs*1 pound lean ground beef8 to 10 cheese slices (optional)8 to 10 hamburger buns or English muffins (preferably whole grain)Pickle slices and ketchup to garnishInstructions:In a large bowl, mix egg, Purple Puree, ketchup, salt, and bread crumbs. Then add the ground beef, mixing with hands until well combined. If the mixture is too sticky, add a few more bread crumbs.With damp hands, shape mixture into 8 to 10 patties that are fairly thin. The burgers may be prepared a day ahead to this point and kept covered in the refrigerator. If you are not freezing for future use, proceed to next steps.Spray a large skillet or grill pan with nonstick cooking spray and set over moderately high heat until hot but not smoking. Cook the burgers for 3 minutes on each side, then flip and add cheese (optional) to melt over patties for another 3 minutes.Serve on soft hamburger buns or English muffins with ketchup and pickles.Makes 8 to 10 burgers.*Whole wheat bread crumbs can be found in natural and organic food stores, but you can easily make your own by pulsing whole grain bread in a food processor to achieve fine crumbs. It's that simple. Three slices of bread will yield about 1 cup of fresh crumbs. They keep for months in a sealed bag in the freezer.Purple PureeBy Missy Chase LapineIngredients:3 cups raw baby spinach leaves (or 1 cup frozen chopped spinach or frozen chopped collard greens)1 1/2 cups fresh or frozen blueberries (no syrup or sugar added)1/2 teaspoon lemon juice1 to 2 tablespoons waterInstructions:Wash raw spinach thoroughly, even if the package says ""prewashed."" Bring spinach or collards and water to a boil in a medium pot. Turn heat to low and let simmer for 10 minutes. If using frozen blueberries, quickly rinse them under cold water to thaw a little, and then drain.Fill the bowl of your food processor with the blueberries and cooked greens, along with the lemon juice and 1 tablespoon of water, and puree on high until as smooth as possible. Stop occasionally to scrape sides. If necessary, use a second tablespoon of water to make a fairly smooth puree.The puree can be stored in the refrigerator for up to two days, or you can freeze 1/4-cup portions in sealed plastic bags or small plastic containers.Makes 1 cup.Note: Double the recipe if you'd like to make extra puree to store for later use. Turkey MeatballsBy Jennifer IserlohI took this American classic to a healthier new level by adding turkey and whole wheat pasta. I haven't met a family yet who doesn't love spaghetti and meatballs, and this is an easy way to introduce your little ones to whole wheat products.Ingredients:1 cup whole wheat bread crumbs1/4 cup sweet red bell pepper, grated1 egg, beaten1/4 cup grated Parmesan cheese1/2 teaspoon salt to taste1/4 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper2 cloves garlic, minced1 pound ground turkey, preferably dark meat1 tablespoon olive oil2 26-ounce cans of chopped tomatoes1 sprig fresh basil16 ounces whole wheat pasta, cooked according to package directionsInstructions:Soak the bread crumbs in egg and grated red pepper, breaking up the mixture with your fingers until smooth. Add Parmesan, salt, and pepper, mixing until well combined.Add meat and garlic. Combine with bread mixture until the bread is well incorporated. Form 2-inch meatballs and place on a sheet of aluminum or waxed paper.Heat a large skillet on high heat and add olive oil. When the oil is hot, add the meatballs and cook 4 to 5 minutes, turning occasionally until the meatballs are golden brown on all sides.Add tomatoes and basil. Reduce to a simmer. Cook 10 to 15 minutes, covered, until the sauce thickens and the meatballs are cooked through.Serve with pasta.Makes 4 servings.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011. Unsafe foods for toddlers.

5 things you didn't know about formula feeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_5-things-you-didnt-know-about-formula-feeding_10357994.bc,"There's more to formula feeding than picking your favorite brand. From how it can affect your baby's poop to how much your baby will eat, we reveal a few surprises you may encounter when feeding your child.Formula-fed babies have different poopThe contents of your baby's diaper are directly affected by what you feed her. And not only are ""formula poops"" different, but they can also be a bit shocking  particularly for parents who switch over from breastfeeding.""Our baby went to formula at 5 weeks, and there was a drastic change in her poop,"" says one mom. ""The smell, texture, consistency, amount, color, and frequency all changed!""Why the difference? As pediatrician Margaret Morris explains, it's simply a matter of the body adapting to what it eats. ""The flora of the gastrointestinal tract changes depending on what kind of food is running through it  and formula is a different food from breast milk,"" she says.Many parents report that formula poop smells somewhat stronger, is darker in color, and is thicker than breast milk poop. If you want the nitty-gritty details, check out our poop slideshow (because when it comes to poop, a picture really is worth a thousand words).Babies don't digest breast milk and formula at the same rateCan formula-fed babies really go longer between feedings than breastfed babies? In a word, yes.Here's why: Breast milk and most formulas contain the proteins whey and casein. Breast milk contains more whey, which is easier to digest (and therefore babies digest it faster) than casein. Formula contains more casein, which babies digest more slowly.Before you get your hopes up for a good night's sleep, however, remember that every baby is different. Jatinder Bhatia, chief of neonatology at Georgia Health Sciences University and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, explains that each baby has his own unique caloric needs, personality, and sleep patterns. As a result, some formula-fed babies feed  and wake  just as often as breastfed babies.""My older son was exclusively formula-fed, and he woke up on the identical schedule that my exclusively breastfed baby did,"" says one BabyCenter mom.Still, there's no doubt that formula takes longer to digest than breast milk. So if you seem to be feeding your baby a little less often than your breastfeeding friend feeds hers, don't worry.Your baby can be allergic to formulaMost babies easily digest formula with sunny smiles and a few contented burps. But some have an allergic reaction to the cow's milk protein in the formula, making for a less sunny experience.(Note: A milk protein intolerance is different than lactose intolerance, which doesn't develop until late childhood or early adolescence.)Your baby's bowel movements can serve as a major clue to how digestion is going, so if you're wondering whether your baby has a formula allergy, check things out down below. ""Blood or mucus in the stool usually means the bowels are inflamed, which is a sign of a possible allergy,"" says Morris.Other red flags include diarrhea, vomiting, fussiness around feedings, or a skin rash.Constant discomfort can also be a symptom. Of course, as any parent of a colicky baby will tell you, continuous crying doesn't always mean a formula allergy. Still, as Morris puts it, ""If a baby is persistently unhappy, there's probably a reason, and an allergy may very well be it. So it's important to check it out.""If your baby is allergic to milk-based formula, your doctor may recommend switching to one made from soy instead. If your baby is also allergic to soy protein, your doctor may recommend an extra-hydrolyzed formula, in which the protein has been broken down into a more digestible form.""My baby started to develop a major rash on his face and neck,"" one mom says. ""I brought him into the doctor and was instructed to switch to soy-based formula. Within 24 hours, his rash disappeared.""Different babies eat different amountsWhile trading stories of sleep deprivation and spit-up explosions with your mommy group, you notice your friend's baby slowly sipping on 3 ounces of formula. Before he's halfway done, your baby has wolfed down 7 ounces! Have you birthed a glutton?Nope. It's nothing more than a classic case of individual difference, says Morris. ""Formula portions are not one size fits all,"" she explains. ""Some babies need more calories than others, and what is sufficient for one child's growth may not be sufficient for another's.""In addition, your child's formula intake will vary from meal to meal  just as you may want a light salad for lunch but crave a more substantial dinner. ""Don't be shocked if your baby takes 4 ounces at one feeding and 6 ounces at the next,"" says Morris. Let your baby's cues guide you.Despite the variability, however, it's still important to follow some basic guidelines. Generally speaking, babies who are not yet on solids should get about 2.5 ounces of formula per pound of body weight in every 24-hour period. So if your baby weighs 6 pounds, you'll give her about 15 ounces of formula. If she weighs 10 pounds, she should drink about 25 ounces a day.And don't forget to schedule regular visits with your baby's doctor to track her growth and ensure that everything is in order.Most formula is basically the sameIt's easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer variety of formulas on the grocery store shelf. How do you choose the best one? Many parents are relieved to hear that when it comes to the most important nutrients, all formulas are created equal.This is because formula is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which requires manufacturers to include 29 specific nutrients in each serving. While different brands have different names, packaging, and prices, none of them will short-change you on the required ingredients.One ingredient that's not in all formulas is the fatty acid DHA, which some studies have shown can improve cognition and visual processing. It's included in many formulas these days, but not all, so you may want to look for a brand that includes it.There are, however, many specialized formulas for specific situations. Formulas designed for premature and low-birth-weight babies, for example, contain more calories than the standard types. Formulas for babies with reflux have rice or other thickeners added to it. There are also soy or hydrolyzed formulas for infants with potential allergies or milk protein intolerance.Parents who prefer to go the organic route can find formulas made with organic ingredients. Organic formulas are subject to the same FDA regulations as other formulas. In addition, they must be certified as organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Still feeling undecided? Your child's doctor can help you choose the formula that best fits your baby's needs. You can also compare notes with other parents in our formula-feeding community group.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a. Choosing a formula.

Stomach flu (gastroenteritis),https://www.babycenter.com/0_stomach-flu-gastroenteritis_1190017.bc,"What is stomach flu?Stomach flu, or gastroenteritis, is an inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract. Despite the name, it's not caused by the influenza virus. The most common culprit is one of a number of other viruses, including rotavirus, adenovirus, calicivirus, and astrovirus.But gastroenteritis can also be caused by a potentially more serious bacterial infection, such as Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, Campylobacter, or E. coli. Still other cases are caused by parasites such as giardia.If your baby has gastroenteritis, she may have diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, chills, and achiness. Her symptoms may be mild or severe, and they may last for just a few hours or for days, depending on the culprit.How did my baby get stomach flu?Viral gastroenteritis is very contagious. Your baby may have eaten something contaminated with the virus or shared a cup or utensils with someone who has the virus. (It's possible to have the virus without showing symptoms.)If bacteria or a parasite is to blame, your child may have ingested contaminated food or drinking water.Another way your baby may have picked up the illness is by coming in contact with infected fecal matter and then putting her hands in her mouth. This sounds gross, but it happens a lot, especially in daycare situations. Remember that germs are microscopic, so even when a child's hands don't look dirty, they may be covered with bacteria.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.How common is stomach flu?Viral gastroenteritis is the second most common illness in the United States after upper respiratory infections such as colds. Most babies will come down with the stomach flu at least twice a year, more often if they're in daycare. Kids often enjoy a boost in their immunity after they turn 3 years old and may not contract it as often.When should I call my child's doctor?Give the doctor a call as soon as you suspect that your baby has gastroenteritis. Also call if your baby has been vomiting for more than two days or has blood in her stool, or you think she's excessively fussy.Use your doctor's guidelines for phoning in the event of a fever. (Common suggestions are fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit if your baby's less than 3 months old; a fever of 101 degrees F if she's between 3 and 6 months old; and a fever of 103 degrees F or higher if she's 6 months or older.)Also call your doctor if your baby shows any of the classic signs of dehydration:decreased urination (more than six hours without a wet diaper)excessive sleepiness or fussinessa sunken soft spotwrinkled skinsunken eyesextreme thirstdry lipscrying without tearscool, discolored hands and feetIf your baby appears dehydrated and no doctor is available, take her to the emergency room.If your baby is in danger of dehydration, the doctor might recommend IV rehydration. He may want to admit her to the hospital or just keep her there for a few hours.If a blood or stool test reveals that your child has a parasitic or bacterial infection, she may also be given a course of antibiotics. Don't be alarmed. Odds are, she'll be released and back to her healthy self within a few days. How should I treat stomach flu?First, you'll want to call your baby's doctor and tell her what's going on, especially if your child is under 6 months.If your baby has a bacterial infection, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Medication won't be helpful for a case of viral gastroenteritis, though, which like all viral infections just has to run its course. Don't give your child anti-diarrhea medication  it'll just prolong her illness and can have potentially serious side effects.If your child has a fever and seems uncomfortable, ask your doctor about giving her the appropriate dose of infant acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Never give your child aspirin, which is associated with Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal illness.Dehydration is a concern whenever a child is losing fluid, whether it's through vomiting, diarrhea, or a fever.Depending on how much she's vomiting and whether she's able to keep down any liquids, the doctor may recommend giving her an over-the-counter oral electrolyte solution, such as Pedialyte, Rehydralyte, or Enfalyte. These solutions help replace lost fluids, minerals, and salts. The doctor can let you know how much your baby should be drinking based on her age and weight.If your child isn't able to keep down formula or breast milk, the doctor may advise you to give her small sips of the electrolyte solution throughout the day, until she's able to keep that down, and then slowly go back to her normal diet.While you're trying to keep your baby hydrated, stay away from high-sugar foods like juices, sodas, and Jell-O, which can make stomach flu symptoms worse. (Gastroenteritis can temporarily damage the lining of the small intestine, making it difficult to digest these sweet foods.)If your baby is eating solids and has a relatively mild case of gastroenteritis  say, mild diarrhea but no vomiting  she can continue to eat modest amounts throughout the course of her illness and probably won't require oral electrolyte solution. Breastfeeding or formula feeding should be enough to keep her hydrated. When can my baby go back to eating solids?Talk with the doctor and follow your baby's cues. She may be able to continue eating almost normally, or it may be better to keep her off solid foods for a couple of days.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children with gastroenteritis resume a normal diet (staying away from fatty foods) as soon as possible. That includes such staples as complex carbohydrates (whole-grain breads and cereals), lean meats, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables.Take note that this menu is different from the diet doctors used to prescribe. ""The BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) was once very commonly advocated, but we no longer recommend it because it lacks protein and other vital nutrients,"" says William John Cochran, associate professor of pediatrics at the Geisinger Clinic in Danville, Pennsylvania.Studies show that reintroducing a standard diet soon after acute symptoms ease can actually shorten a child's bout of gastroenteritis by half a day because it restores nutrients to the system that are necessary to fight infection. On the other hand, if the bug kills your baby's appetite and she misses a few days of good nutrition, don't worry. As long as she stays hydrated, she'll be fine.How can I help protect my baby against gastroenteritis?Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after every diaper change and bathroom visit and before preparing or eating food. The same goes for other family members and daycare staff. It's also a good idea to wash your baby's hands often throughout the day.What's more, be sure to follow safe food preparation and cooking practices.To prevent your child from getting rotavirus (which can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, especially in babies and young children), your baby should receive three doses of the rotavirus vaccine: one at 2 months, another at 4 months, and the last at 6 months.Show sources Hide sources AAP.

Cow's milk: When and how to introduce it,https://www.babycenter.com/0_cows-milk-when-and-how-to-introduce-it_1334703.bc,"Why should I wait until my baby is at least 12 months old to introduce cow's milk?Babies can't digest cow's milk as completely or easily as breast milk or formula. Cow's milk contains high concentrations of protein and minerals, which can tax your baby's immature kidneys.Cow's milk doesn't have the right amounts of iron, vitamin C, and other nutrients for infants. It may even cause iron-deficiency anemia in some babies, since cow's milk protein can irritate the lining of the digestive system, leading to blood in the stools. Finally, cow's milk doesn't provide the healthiest types of fat for growing babies.However, once your child's ready to digest it, dairy milk can supplement a balanced diet of solid foods that include cereals, vegetables, fruits and meats.Why should my child start drinking cow's milk?Milk is a rich source of calcium, which builds strong bones and teeth and helps regulate blood clotting and muscle control. It's also one of the few sources of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium and is crucial for bone growth. (Almost all milk in the United States is fortified with vitamin D.)Milk also provides protein for growth, and carbohydrates to give your child the energy he needs all day. And if your child gets enough calcium from the get-go, there's evidence that he'll have a lower risk of high blood pressure, stroke, colon cancer, and hip fractures later in life.Feeding timeline: Your child's development Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:14Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:14Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all baby videosDo I need to stop breastfeeding when my child starts drinking cow's milk?There's no need to wean your child after you introduce cow's milk. As long as you both enjoy breastfeeding, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says it's fine to continue breastfeeding past your child's first birthday.How much milk should my toddler drink?According to the AAP, your 1-year-old can get enough calcium and vitamin D from 8 to 12 ounces (1 to 1 1/2 cups) of cow's milk  or the equivalent amount of other milk products, like yogurt or cheese. By age 2, your child should get 16 ounces, or 2 cups, of cow's milk or other milk products each day.However, don't give your child more than 32 ounces (4 cups) of milk a day or she may not have room for the other foods she needs to round out her diet. If your toddler's still thirsty, offer water. Can I give my toddler fat-free or reduced-fat milk?In most cases, not yet. The AAP recommends giving whole milk to 1-year-olds unless they're at high risk for obesity. Children this age need the higher fat content of whole milk to maintain normal weight gain and to help the body absorb vitamins A and D. The concentration of protein and minerals in nonfat milk is also too high for children this age. Once your child turns 2, you may decide to switch him to reduced-fat or nonfat milk as long as he's growing well.Possible exceptions: Your child's doctor may recommend giving your child reduced-fat milk (2 percent) after age 1 if you're overweight or obese, or have a family history of obesity, high cholesterol, or cardiovascular disease.My toddler doesn't seem to want cow's milk. How can I get her to try it?Some toddlers take to cow's milk right away, but others are hesitant to make the switch because it has a different texture, taste, and even temperature than breast milk.If that's the case for your toddler, try mixing cow's milk with some breast milk or formula at first. (Try one part milk to three parts of breast milk or formula.) Then slowly shift the ratio until she's drinking 100 percent milk. It may also help to serve cow's milk at room temperature.It can be a challenge to meet the nutritional recommendations for milk or milk products if your child doesn't care for them. But there are many ways to include these in your child's diet. For example:Add milk to her cereal.Serve yogurt, cottage cheese, pudding, custard, or shakes for snacks.Make soup with milk instead of water.Add a milk-based sauce or gravy to casseroles.What if my child can't tolerate milk or can't have it because we're vegans?Regardless of the reason your child doesn't get calcium and vitamin D from milk and other dairy products, your pediatrician will probably recommend either fortified soy milk or calcium and vitamin D supplements.Should I buy organic or hormone-free milk for my child?There's no conclusive evidence that these kinds of milk are better for children, but there's no harm in them. (Organic milk does tend to be more expensive.) Read up on growth hormones in milk and organic foods to help you make a decision.However, the AAP warns against giving your child ""raw"" or unpasteurized milk, though. Without pasteurization, milk may contain harmful bacteria or parasites that can cause serious health problems.Could my child have a milk allergy?If your child drank cow's-milk-based formula as a baby without any problems, you can rest assured that he'll have no problem tolerating regular cow's milk. Even babies who were exclusively breastfed for the first year can usually handle regular cow's milk because they've been exposed to cow's milk protein in breast milk (unless you avoided all dairy).If your child drank soy formula because your doctor recommended it, check with your doctor before introducing cow's milk. Your doctor may recommend that you start with a soy beverage that's been fortified with vitamin D and calcium. (See what our experts say about giving soy milk or rice milk to a child who won't drink cow's milk.)If your child drank soy formula because your doctor recommended it, though, check with your doctor before introducing cow's milk. Your doctor may recommend that you start with a soy beverage that's been fortified with vitamin D and calcium. (See what our experts say about giving soy milk or rice milk to a child who won't drink cow's milk.)But true allergies to cow's milk are relatively uncommon: Only 2 to 3 percent of infants are allergic to milk, according to the AAP, and almost all of them outgrow it. (Learn the difference between a milk allergy and lactose intolerance.) The main symptoms of milk allergy are:Rashes or hives, especially around the mouth or chinAbdominal discomfortDiarrheaVomitingSwellingItchinessAnd chronic nasal stuffiness, a runny nose, cough, wheezing, or breathing difficulties could all be signs that a milk allergy is affecting your child's respiratory system. If your toddler develops any of these symptoms, talk with his doctor.Take your child to his healthcare provider or to the nearest emergency room immediately if he:Is extremely pale or weakHas hives all over his bodyDevelops swelling in the head or neckHas bloody diarrheaHe may be having a life-threatening allergic reaction.If it turns out that your toddler is allergic to cow's milk, you'll want to be careful to avoid foods such as cottage cheese, condensed or evaporated milk, ice cream, yogurt, margarine that contains milk, butter, milk chocolate, and powdered milk. Thanks to a law passed in 2004, all allergens must be clearly marked on food products. In this case, the label will say ""milk.""Learn more:10 nutrients every child needsShould I monitor how much fat my child eats?Best and worst drinks for thirsty kidsShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Pesticides in your child's food: What you need to know,https://www.babycenter.com/pesticides-in-your-child's-food,"Should I be concerned about pesticides in the food my child eats?Yes. Pesticide residues are often found on produce, and fruits and vegetables are an important part of your child's diet.Pesticides protect crops from damage, which helps keep groceries affordable. But research shows that pesticides also contribute to a wide range of health problems, including cancer, lung disease, reproductive problems, and possibly disorders of the endocrine and immune systems.Animal testing indicates that pesticides can cause permanent changes in brain chemistry that may lead to behavioral disorders, learning disabilities, and even long-term damage to the brain and nervous system.Pesticide exposure can affect your child's health today and in the future. In fact, some effects may not become apparent until later in life.Are children more vulnerable to pesticides than adults are?Yes. Children tend to eat a limited number of foods, which can increase their exposure to specific pesticides. They also eat more food relative to their body weight than adults do.Children may also absorb pesticides more easily. And because their gastrointestinal tract is still developing, their bodies may be less capable of breaking down toxins. Finally, pesticides can block absorption of the nutrients that are vital to healthy growth and development.Keep in mind that eating food isn't the only way your child can come in contact with pesticides: They can also get into drinking water.And if you use pesticides in your home or yard, that's another way your child will be exposed. You can even track pesticides into your home on the soles of your shoes. Then your child can ingest the chemicals if he plays on the floor or puts something from the floor into his mouth, for example.(Pesticides can also cross the placenta, so pregnant women need to take care to minimize exposure.)Aren't there regulations to protect my child from pesticides in food?In the United States, existing regulations are intended to do just that. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) sets limits on the amount of pesticides that may be used on crops. The limit is based on how toxic a particular pesticide is, how much residue will remain on the crop, and how much of the crop a consumer is likely to eat.The Food Quality Protection Act, passed in 1996, requires that the residue levels of pesticides be safe for babies and children, taking into account children's special sensitivity to pesticides. However, under certain circumstances  like in the case of economic hardship to the farmer  the EPA can authorize the use of pesticides that don't meet safety standards.Some consumer advocacy groups believe that limits on pesticides should be stricter to protect children.While federal regulations have been gradually prohibiting the most dangerous pesticides, more remain in use. In addition, tests have found that some produce contains high levels of pesticides that have long been banned in the United States because these chemicals are still in the soil. And when farmers plant in contaminated soils, they often end up with contaminated produce.The U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Pesticide Data Program tests foods for pesticide residues. According to the program's annual report, 64 percent of the fruits and vegetables  both fresh and processed (including baby food)  tested in 2010 had detectable pesticide residues. Low levels were found in eggs, oats, catfish, and drinking water.The USDA emphasizes that these foods are safe to eat. Pesticide residues were largely within the limit deemed acceptable by the EPA. Why do fresh fruits and vegetables have higher residue levels than canned?Foods grown for processing don't need to look appealing, so they normally aren't sprayed as much before harvest. And when foods are processed, they're often peeled, washed, or heated, which removes many pesticide residues.Should I cut down on the amount of fresh fruits and vegetables I feed my toddler?No. Don't let a fear of pesticides make you serve less produce. Fruits and vegetables are an important part of a healthy diet for every child.TheAmerican Academy of Pediatrics (AAP)points out that the negative impact of not including fruits and vegetables in your child's diet is far greater than any potential risk from pesticides at the levels found in produce. And there are things you can do to reduce the amount of pesticides your child consumes without restricting produce in his diet.What can I do to protect my child from pesticides in food?These simple steps can greatly reduce the amount of pesticides in your family's food:Peel fruits and vegetables, and remove the outer leaves of vegetables like lettuce and cabbage.Scrub (under running water) all fruits and vegetables that you don't peel. Cleaning products specifically designed to wash produce may also help.Some foods  like strawberries, grapes, broccoli, lettuce, and spinach  are more difficult to wash. Soak these briefly, then rinse.Choose produce without mold, bruising, and decay. These are likely to harbor more pesticides.Trim the fat off meat and remove the skin from poultry. Pesticides (and other environmental chemicals) are often concentrated in the fat and skin of poultry, meat, and fish.Consider buying organic produce, especially foods your child eats a lot of or items on the ""Dirty Dozen"" list (below).Look for locally grown produce. Fruits and vegetables that are grown far away require after-harvest pesticides and waxes to help them survive the long trip. And produce that has to travel is often picked before ripening, which reduces flavor as well as nutrients.Buy produce in season. Although it seems like a treat to buy juicy, red strawberries or tomatoes in the dead of winter, keep in mind that food grown out of season usually comes from another hemisphere. Again, this produce will be picked earlier and probably contain more pesticides.Serve a wide variety of food, especially produce. A varied diet limits repeated consumption of the same pesticide.Avoid the ""Dirty Dozen""When purchasing and preparing produce, keep in mind the Environmental Working Group's ""Dirty Dozen"". This list of the fruits and vegetables with the highest  and lowest  levels of pesticide residue is based on the results from 60,700 tests collected by the USDA and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.As of 2012, these are the 12 fruits and vegetables with thehighestlevels of pesticide residue: apples, celery, sweet bell peppers, peaches, strawberries, imported nectarines, grapes, spinach, lettuce, cucumbers, domestic blueberries, and potatoes.These had thelowestlevels of pesticide residue: onions, sweet corn, pineapple, avocado, cabbage, sweet peas, asparagus, mangoes, eggplant, kiwi, domestic cantaloupe, sweet potatoes, grapefruit, watermelon, and mushrooms.This doesn't mean that you need to ban apples from your shopping cart, but you may not want to rely on them solely to meet your child's fruit requirements. Introduce your child to many different kinds of fruit, including those with low pesticide residue, like kiwi and mangoes. And when you do serve apples that aren't organic, wash them thoroughly or peel them.Is organic produce worth the additional cost?That's up to you. Two recent research reviews found no compelling evidence that organic foods were nutritionally better than nonorganic foods. Eating organically grown foods may reduce your exposure to pesticides, but they have the same nutritional value as their conventionally grown counterparts. Also, some organic meat (like pork) doesn't have the antibacterial properties that make it less likely for bacteria to grow.But a study done in 2008 found that when children switched to a diet of organic food, the amount of pesticides in their urine dropped to nearly undetectable levels. And some studies also show that organic fruits and vegetables actually are more nutritious because they contain more vitamin C and antioxidants, which may help prevent heart disease, than nonorganic fruits and vegetables. For example, one study found that organic strawberries have 8.5 percent more antioxidants than nonorganic fruit.If you choose to buy organic produce, try to buy it directly from the producer  there's a good chance it'll be cheaper. Look for organic growers at your local farmer's market, farm stand, or food cooperative.And if you have the outdoor space, consider growing some of your own organic fruits and vegetables. Gardening is also a great way to teach your child about nutrition."
How to get your preschooler to eat more healthy food,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-get-your-preschooler-to-eat-more-healthy-food_64318.bc,"Eating well gives your preschooler the energy he needs to learn and grow. And it'll help him stay healthy, maintain a healthy weight, and establish good lifelong eating habits. Here are some ways to make nutritious food the most appealing choice:Get your preschooler involvedA great way to get your preschooler excited about eating a range of healthy foods is to involve him in the family's meal-planning decisions. Let him help you make out menus and a grocery list. Have him check to see whether you're out of grapes and suggest favorite suppers or breakfasts.When you take him food shopping, ask him to hold the grocery list for you as you shop. Give him a few choices to make along the way: Peaches or mangoes? Peas or carrots? Graham crackers or fig bars?Show your child how you check for specific ingredients on the nutrition labels of the foods you choose  and those you put back on the shelf.Make a habit of selecting one new fruit or vegetable to try each week, keeping in mind that your child may not be interested in trying something unfamiliar until it's been offered numerous times.To encourage your child to take some responsibility for his own nutrition, you could help him create his own daily food chart, with boxes for each category: fruit, vegetables, grains, dairy, and meat/protein. (Check out the United States Department of Agriculture's ready-made chart to get started.)Show your child how to color in or check off the appropriate boxes when he finishes a meal or snack. Then look at the chart together at the end of each day to tally how well he did in meeting his nutritional goals.Encourage his involvement in the kitchenInvite your preschooler to help you in the kitchen. Enlist his help putting toppings on the pizza or vegetables on kabobs. Show him how to wash lettuce and toss a salad. Once he can handle it, help him measure ingredients  an excellent foundation for learning fractions! Make meals and snacks funArrange carrot sticks, cherry tomatoes, and bell peppers to look like a face on your preschooler's plate. Make pancakes in the shape of his initials and cut toast into a heart shape. Offer yogurt or low-fat salad dressing for him to dip pretzels, vegetables, or fruit slices in, and outfit him with a lively placemat and dinnerware. Go to the sourceTake your preschooler on an outing to an orchard, berry farm, or dairy so he can see where the food on his plate comes from. The novelty just might inspire him to try something he wouldn't otherwise be interested in.There's nothing like seeing your own food grow to motivate kids to eat their fruits and veggies. Think about planting your own. Even if you don't have much space, you can grow tomatoes or strawberries in a container on a balcony or patio. A study published in 2007 in the Journal of the American Dietetic Association shows that preschoolers in rural areas are more likely to eat more fruits and veggies if they're grown at home.Be picky about juicesFruit juices count toward your preschooler's daily fruit intake, but be careful about the kind and amount of juice you offer. Serve your preschooler only 100 percent fruit juice or fruit-vegetable juice combinations. (These are full of nutrients and contain less natural sugar than many fruit juices.) Some kids even enjoy vegetable juices straight up!If your preschooler won't drink milk, you may want to find juices that are fortified with calcium and vitamin D, but don't offer fruit ""drinks"" because they may contain as little as 10 percent juice and an array of flavorings and sweeteners.Keep in mind that even the healthiest fruit juices can easily become too much of a good thing. Juice can contribute to childhood obesity and malnourishment because a child who drinks a great deal of juice gets extra calories and, at the same time, not all the nutrients he needs. It can also lead to tooth decay, especially if your child carries around a sippy cup all day long.So limit your child to 4 to 6 ounces of fruit juice per day, and use fresh fruit to meet the rest of his requirement. When he's thirsty, offer him water. (You can also water down your child's juice, half and half, for the flavor of juice with fewer extra calories.)Shake and bakeSmoothies are an easy way to get fruit and other nutritious foods into your child's diet. All you need is a blender and a few simple ingredients. You can use your choice of fresh fruit, frozen fruit such as berries or bananas (peel before freezing), or even canned pineapple or peaches (strain the syrup first).You might want to include tofu or hard-cooked egg whites  they add protein without changing the taste or texture  and a bit of ground flax seed for extra fiber and omega 3s. Blend with fruit juice or add milk, yogurt, or frozen yogurt for a creamier drink and a dose of calcium.Whole wheat and bran muffins and quick breads are a good source of grains and fiber, and they can also be a vehicle for fruits and vegetables. Make or buy them with bananas, blueberries, carrots, pineapple, or zucchini. Fortify but don't foolYou might try incorporating healthy foods into dishes you know your preschooler likes, but don't be sneaky about it. (Even if he falls for it now, he may later feel betrayed when he figures out what's up.)Tell him that you're giving him some special pasta spirals tonight  with spinach mixed in or with broccoli and cheese on top. Better to be up-front and encourage an adventurous approach to eating.Make it countBe aware of your child's nutritional needs, but don't worry about them. It's not hard to meet a preschooler's daily requirements. Here are some easy ways to serve up good nutrition:One tablespoon of peanut butter on one slice of whole wheat bread and an 8-ounce glass of low-fat milk provides plenty of nutrition. Before the age of 4, this menu will fulfill all of your preschooler's protein requirement, one third of his grain recommendation, 50 percent of his daily dairy, 65 percent of his need for zinc, 32 percent of vitamin E, 18 percent of iron, and 65 percent of his calcium needs. For a 4-year-old, it will fulfill 77 percent of his protein needs, 20 percent of his grain recommendation, 50 percent of his dairy, 39 percent of zinc, 28 percent of vitamin E, 13 percent of iron, and 41 percent of his calcium needs.A bowl of bran cereal with raisins (three-quarters cup cereal with three-quarters cup low-fat milk) and half a cup of orange juice will provide an excellent start to a preschooler's day. Before age 4, this menu will fulfill half of your preschooler's fruit recommendation and almost half of his dairy needs, a third of his grain recommendation, 81 percent of protein, 51 percent of iron, 63 percent of zinc, and over 100 percent of his daily need for vitamin C. Once he's 4 years old, it will fulfill a third of his fruit and almost half his dairy requirements, 20 percent of his grain, 56 percent of his protein, 36 percent of his iron, 38 percent of zinc, and over 100 percent of his daily vitamin C needs.If your preschooler is younger than 4, one slice of cheese pizza will provide 89 percent of his protein, 28 percent of his calcium, 35 percent of his iron, and 22 percent of his vitamin A needs for the day. Once he's 4 years old, a slice of cheese pizza will fulfill 61 percent of his protein needs, 18 percent of his calcium, 24 percent of his iron, and 16 percent of his daily need for vitamin A. Find fast-food alternativesMost fast food is full of fat, sugar, salt, and excess calories. An occasional fast-food burger and fries won't cause any harm, but if you have an alternative, take it. Teach your child to select from the healthy options on the menu  yes to the grilled chicken sandwich, no to the fried onion rings, and forget about super-sizing the meal!Or pick and choose: Have the burger but choose apple slices or carrot sticks instead of fries. Do your best to limit these kinds of meals to no more than once a week.Be a good role modelAs you consider all the ways of getting your preschooler to eat well, remember to practice what you preach. If your child sees you eating lots of junk food or skipping meals, you can't expect him to eat properly. Make an effort to eat whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and you and your child will both be better off.Be upbeatForget the food fights. Let your child decide how much he wants to eat. And don't use a sweet treat as a bribe or withhold it as a punishment.Try to make mealtime together  at the table, not in front of the television  as enjoyable as possible, so that your child can establish a good, healthy relationship with food."
Helping an overweight child,https://www.babycenter.com/0_helping-an-overweight-child_64364.bc,"I think my child might be overweight. How can I tell if it's a problem?Carrying extra weight can put your child at risk for health problems like heart disease and diabetes now and in the future. Don't get too worried if your child is a little chunky at this age, but do talk with his doctor about your concerns. She can help you determine whether your child's weight is a problem that you should start addressing now.Keep in mind that while being chubby as a child can predict being overweight as an adult, it can also be just a stage, especially at your child's age. So even though your preschooler may seem a little heavy to you, as his body changes in the next few years, he may take on a leaner look. Children tend to grow into their weight  that is, they generally thin out as they become taller. (They don't stop gaining weight altogether, of course, but ideally their height catches up and the two become proportional.)Your preschooler is more likely to ""outgrow"" being overweight than an adolescent is. Still, if your child was severely overweight as a toddler, and still is as a preschooler, his chances of remaining overweight increase, says Nancy F. Krebs, M.D., professor of pediatrics and co-chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics' Task Force on Obesity. How will the doctor determine whether my child is overweight?Your child's doctor will measure his height and weight and plot these numbers on a growth chart. Doctors today are using a new series of growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that take into consideration a child's body mass index, or BMI, which indicates whether his height and weight are proportional. The BMI is a better indicator of whether your child is carrying too much body fat than a weight measurement alone. While the BMI of an adult is calculated with a straight formula, children's BMIs are based on gender and age, to allow for the change in body composition that happens as a child gets older.Like a standard growth chart, your child will be ranked in percentiles compared to his peers. If your child's BMI is in the 85th percentile  meaning it's higher than that of 85 percent of children his age and gender  he would be considered overweight. If he's in the 95th percentile, he's considered obese.In addition to your child's height and weight, his doctor will factor in how much his parents weigh, how long he's been heavy, and his overall health. If my child is overweight, what can I do about it?Doctors don't usually recommend restrictive diets or weight loss programs for children, as they're necessary only in extreme cases. In fact, a restrictive diet can be harmful to a child's health and interfere with his growth and development if it's not carefully monitored. In most cases, the goal is to maintain the child's weight with a healthy diet so that as he grows his weight will be more proportional to his height.Ask your doctor for suggestions on how you can help your child develop healthy eating habits. She may suggest that you follow the Food Guide Pyramid, which advises offering your child three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruit each day, in addition to servings of whole grains, milk, and meat. Of course, you'll want to limit sweets and other high-calorie, low-nutrient foods. The doctor may also recommend that you consult a registered dietitian to help you create a balanced eating plan for your child.Keep in mind that if the whole family is eating healthy foods for each meal and snack (and enjoying plenty of exercise), your preschooler will find it much easier to do the same.Help your child steer clear of these bad habits, all of which can cause him to gain weight:Unsupervised snacking. Limit or eliminate choices like cookies and chips, and replace them with healthy options like fresh fruits and vegetables and low-fat puddings, yogurts, and cheeses. Make sure your child isn't grazing all day, either, even on healthy foods.Eating while watching television. A child who's distracted may not recognize when he's full. Help your child learn to listen to his body's signals to tell him when he's had enough.Consuming excessive amounts of soda or juice. Save soda and other sweet beverages for special occasions, if you serve them at all. Fruit juice does count as a serving of fruit, but too much juice can fill your child up so that he won't be hungry at mealtime for the other nourishing foods he needs. Limit juice to about 6 ounces per day.Indulging in vending-machine food. Most vending-machine food isn't very nutritious. If your child is going to be out and about at snack time, pack something healthy for him.Spending too much time in front of the TV or computer. Kids can get sucked into sitting still for hours. In addition, TV advertisements encourage the consumption of high-calorie, nutrient-poor ""junk"" foods. To encourage physical activity, keep TVs out of children's bedrooms.Eating too much at meals. See our expert's advice on how to handle overeating.Instead of nagging or ridiculing your child about his weight, which is likely to make him resentful and rebellious, give him the opportunity to choose healthy foods and activities, and praise him for it when he does. And don't forget to set a good example by eating well yourself. ""Especially for young children, the importance of parents' modeling healthy eating and healthy lifestyles can't be overemphasized,"" says Krebs. ""Children learn what they see!""Don't start subjecting your child to regular weigh-ins at home, either  they can become a source of anxiety. However, if your child's BMI is above the 95th percentile, your doctor may ask to see him once a month to monitor his progress. Just treat these visits like any other trip to the doctor, and don't make a big deal about the weigh-in process. Keep the focus on developing healthy habits, rather than on your child's weight. How can I encourage my child to become more active?Exercise is a key component of weight maintenance, and many kids don't get enough of it. The 2000 Dietary Guidelines for Americans from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) recommend at least 60 minutes of activity per day for kids  ideally, done with their parents. Instead of settling on the couch after dinner, encourage your family to take a walk or bike ride together. Try in-line skating or dancing. And look for ways to be more active throughout the day  by walking or biking instead of driving, for instance, or by taking the stairs instead of the elevator. For most children, encouraging more time outdoors is all it takes to get them to have more active playtime.What if my child remains overweight as he grows up?You can help improve your child's future by showing him how to eat better and become more active now. This will boost his chances of heading off a weight problem and growing into a healthy adult. Even if he never achieves a ""normal"" weight, he'll be healthier if he eats well and is active."

Failure to gain weight in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_failure-to-gain-weight-in-babies_1621.bc,"My baby isn't gaining weight as fast as he was. Should I be worried?Probably not, but it's a good idea to keep an eye on your baby's growth chart. Remember that while your baby should gain weight steadily  with the exception of her first few days, when she may even lose a bit before quickly catching up  it won't always be a perfectly smooth climb.Your baby's growth rate will speed up and slow down. It may even stop temporarily  when she's ill, for example. But overall you should see the ounces and pounds piling on.If you're at all concerned that your baby isn't gaining enough weight, talk with her doctor right away.What will the doctor do?The doctor will give your baby a physical exam and ask you a number of questions to help determine whether there's a problem, and, if so, what the underlying cause might be. She'll look at many factors in addition to your baby's growth rate to assess how he's doing.If your baby is hitting his developmental milestones pretty much on time, relating well to you, and looking otherwise happy and healthy, he's most likely doing fine.If the doctor finds that your baby isn't growing at a healthy rate, however, she may diagnose him with ""failure to gain weight"" or ""failure to thrive."" The criteria she'll use to make this diagnosis may include:falling below the third percentile for weight on his growth chartweighing 20 percent below the ideal weight for his heighta decrease of two or more major percentile lines on his growth chart since his last checkupBy the way, while failure to gain weight can happen to any baby, premature babies are at a higher risk than full-term babies.If your baby has failure to gain weight, it's very important to find out why. Proper nutrition  especially during the first three years  is crucial for a child's mental and physical development.Your baby's doctor may order blood, urine, or other tests and monitor your baby's caloric intake for a period of time. She may also watch you nurse or bottle-feed to see whether your baby's jaw is working correctly or whether he's having trouble sucking. Sometimes the answer is very simple, and sometimes it's quite complicated.The doctor may refer your baby to a pediatric gastroenterologist, a dietitian, or a feeding specialist for evaluation and treatment.This can be a worrisome and frustrating time. It can be difficult to hear that your baby isn't thriving, but it's important that you don't blame yourself or feel like you're not a good or nurturing parent. What could be causing my baby's failure to gain weight?There are so many potential causes that a doctor could spend months performing tests and studying a baby's diet, health history, activity level, and possible causes of stress before discovering the source of the problem.In general, if your baby isn't growing steadily, it means that she's either not eating well or not absorbing or using nutrients properly. Here are some reasons this might happen:Feeding problems:Your baby may be repeatedly getting tired and falling asleep before he gets enough milk.She may have a weak sucking reflex that leaves her unable to get enough milk from your breasts if you're nursing  or even from a bottle, although this occurs more commonly with breastfeeding.A cleft lip or palate would interfere with breastfeeding. These conditions are addressed with special bottles and nipples and the help of feeding specialists. (A cleft lip and palate are usually repaired over the course of a baby's first year.)Being tongue-tied could make it difficult for your baby to nurse well and get all the nourishment she needs. It can also affect bottle feeding, though that's less common.If you're feeding your baby formula, preparing the formula incorrectly can lead to failure to gain weight.If you're nursing and you've had trouble getting a breastfeeding routine going, your baby may not be getting enough to eat. It's possible that your breasts are not producing enough milk to sustain your baby or that your hindmilk isn't letting down.A third of your breast milk is known as foremilk, which is readily available for your baby. When you start to nurse, your body instinctively releases the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates the flow of the rest of your milk, the hindmilk. This is known as the letdown reflex, and you'll know it's happened if your nipples feel tingly or your breast milk spurts. Hindmilk has more calories than foremilk.If you're stressed out or in pain, the letdown reflex can fail to kick in, preventing your baby from getting hindmilk. When this is a chronic problem, it can result in failure to gain weight. To encourage the letdown reflex, try to find a relaxing place to nurse.Some babies who are fed on a strict schedule rather than on demand (whenever they indicate that they're hungry) can get less nutrition than they need. Most experts believe that it's best to let your baby nurse or bottle-feed for as long as he wants when he wants.Growth CalculatorSee how your baby compares to others in height, weight, and head size.Other common causes:If your baby has been ill, his body may need more calories and nutrients. An illness may also hurt your baby's appetite.He may have chronic gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea, reflux, celiac disease, or a milk intolerance.If you have postpartum depression or several other young children vying for your attention, you may be unable to give your baby the attention he needs to be sure he's getting enough calories.In rare cases, failure to gain weight can turn out to be a result of a lung problem, such as cystic fibrosis; a nervous system problem, such as cerebral palsy; a chromosome problem, such as Down syndrome; heart disease; anemia; or a metabolic or an endocrine disorder, such as growth hormone deficiency. If any of these is the cause, it's important to catch it early. How does a doctor treat failure to gain weight?Once you and your doctor figure out what's causing the problem, you can both set about correcting it by treating any medical issues and increasing your baby's caloric intake, if necessary.Getting your baby back up to a healthy weight may mean supplementing breastfeeding with formula or, for a baby who has started on solids, offering more high-calorie foods. Once she's old enough for them, good choices include whole milk products such as cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and pudding (but hold off on offering cows' milk until age 1), eggs, avocados, whole-wheat breads and pastas, pancakes, mashed potatoes, and hot cereals.In severe cases, a baby with failure to gain weight may need to be hospitalized so that she can receive intravenous feedings and be monitored closely.I'm new to nursing. How can I tell whether my baby is getting enough to eat?If your baby's younger than 3 months old and you're breastfeeding him exclusively, you'll know he's getting enough milk if:He wets six to eight cloth diapers, or five to six disposable diapers a day.He has several mustard-colored bowel movements a day for the first month. After the first month, he may have bowel movements less frequently or even skip a day or two in between.When he's nursing, you can see him moving his jaw and hear him sucking. You may even hear him swallowing, if the room is quiet.Your breasts feel softer after a feeding than they did before.He's gaining about an ounce each day for his first three months. (After that, doctors look for a gain of about 0.5 to 0.6 ounces a day until 6 months, 0.4 ounces a day for babies between 6 and 9 months, and 0.3 to 0.4 ounces a day for babies from 9 to 12 months.For other suggestions, read more about how to tell if your baby's getting enough milk.If your baby tends to get sleepy during feedings, keep him alert during feedings. You can try:gently tickling his feetundressing himchanging his diaper before or in the midst of a feedingengaging him in some quiet playsitting him upright to burp him when you're switching from one breast to the otherIf he doesn't finish nursing on both sides, empty your breasts by pumping so you can keep your milk production up.If you're concerned about your baby's weight or food consumption between regularly scheduled checkups, ask to bring your baby to the office to be weighed once a week. For accuracy, make sure you always use the same scale. You can also get a scale to use at home. Medela rents accurate baby scales for home use. Call (800) 435-8316 (option 3) for information.While breastfeeding doesn't always turn out to be the best option for all moms and babies, don't assume that you should switch to formula because you're having some problems. Ask your doctor for advice and perhaps a referral to a lactation consultant.There are things you can do to increase your milk supply, for example, and tips that may help you help your baby nurse more efficiently. You may well be able to resolve the issues without giving up breastfeeding before you intend to.Does failure to gain weight mean that my child will always be smaller than he should be?That depends on the underlying cause of her poor weight gain. If your baby has a long-term medical condition, for example, it's possible that she may always be smaller than average. On the other hand, if the problem is easily reversed, she may catch up by growing faster than usual for a period of time.Show sources Hide sources AHRQ. 2003.

Why Hispanic women may struggle with their weight,https://www.babycenter.com/0_why-hispanic-women-may-struggle-with-their-weight_3653760.bc,"What is obesity?When someone has more body fat than is desirable for her height and build, we say she's overweight. If she's overweight by 20 percent or more, she's considered obese.To measure obesity, we use a system known as body mass index, or BMI. Calculated with a formula that takes into consideration a person's height and weight, BMI tells us whether she is at her ideal weight, underweight, overweight, or obese. If the person's resulting BMI is between 25 and 30, she's overweight, and if her BMI is over 30, then she is obese. (Calculate your BMI.)Being overweight, which could lead to obesity, is the result of eating more calories than we burn. Obesity can cause many physical and psychological problems. It's one of the factors that contributes to a common illness among Latinos: diabetes.Obesity may also cause high blood pressure, high cholesterol, joint pain, and many other ailments. Psychologically, being overweight can trigger eating disorders and low self-esteem, especially in teenagers.Latinas and weight management.Among all women in the United States, Latinas rank first in being overweight and second  right behind African Americans  in obesity. Despite the Latino diet being a healthy eating style overall, various social, cultural, and genetic circumstances affect our population and favor our being overweight.First, Latinos are the ethnic group with the least medical insurance coverage. This means that many of us don't visit the doctor as much as we should, and we don't have frequent checkups that could help us prevent this type of problem. And in our culture, obesity isn't necessarily regarded as something negative.Many of us believe that un nio gordito, a chubby child, is a healthy child. And during pregnancy it's common to think that you must ""eat for two."" In addition, many Latinos have not made exercising a regular habit. The thrift geneAccording to many geneticists, excess pounds are not all due to fatty foods and a lack of exercise. Obesity is also influenced by the genes we've inherited. That is, if our mom or dad is overweight, we're more likely to be overweight than someone born of slim parents.Another theory suggests that the Hispanic population, like some others, has a tendency to accumulate fat called the thrift gene. In studies of the Pima Indians who live between the Mexican Sierra Madre and Arizona, certain differences between groups of Indians were noticed by the researchers.The Pimas who lived in Arizona didn't go through periods of scarcity and led a very Western lifestyle. They rarely exercised, and they ate refined products such as flour and sugar. Most of them  95 percent  were overweight or obese when the study was done, and most had diabetes.On the other hand, the Pimas who inhabited the Sierra Madre lived traditionally, fishing and hunting for food and experiencing periods of scarcity. None of them were obese when the study was carried out. That made researchers think there could be a gene that helps people of this ethnic origin store fat when they have enough food so they can use it during times of scarcity.That worked well for our ancestors, but it's not working well for us now, because these days we can obtain food in abundance at any time and don't need to store up for the scarce times. Plus, we don't have to run after our prey like the Sierra Madre Pima Indians, so we're not getting the kind of exercise our ancestors did.Obesity and pregnancyIt's ideal to begin pregnancy at a healthy weight, because the mom's weight affects the baby's weight, and obesity can cause a host of complications during pregnancy in both mother and baby. But if you're already pregnant, a healthy lifestyle and a balanced diet will benefit both your baby and you. It's important to check with your doctor to find out what the right weight gain is for you, in your particular circumstances. How to fight obesityPregnancy isn't the best time to go on a diet, because your baby depends on what you eat for his own nutrition. Still, you can maintain a healthy weight during this time by eating a balanced dietthat relies on ingredients commonly used in our culture, in the right portions, which will provide your baby with the nutrients he needs  and by doing exercise like swimming and walking.The fact that obesity is partly hereditary and that we may be at higher risk of being overweight doesn't mean we have to resign ourselves to being gordita.By Lourdes Alcaiz, author of Waiting for Beb: A Pregnancy Guide for LatinasMore articles for Latinas:How diabetes affects youImportant medical resources for you and your babyHerbs to avoid during pregnancy and breastfeedingIs it safe to use medicines from other countries?Traditional beliefs and myths about pregnancyBaby care tips and traditions"

Placental abruption,https://www.babycenter.com/0_placental-abruption_1425791.bc,"What is a placental abruption?A placental abruption is a serious condition in which the placenta partially or completely separates from your uterus before your baby's born.The condition can deprive your baby of oxygen and nutrients, and cause severe bleeding that can be dangerous to you both. A placental abruption also increases the risk that your baby will have growth problems (if the abruption is small and goes unnoticed), be born prematurely, or be stillborn.Placental abruption happens in about one in 150 pregnancies. It's most common in the third trimester but can happen any time after 20 weeks.How can I tell if I'm having a placental abruption?In most cases, you'll have some vaginal bleeding, ranging from a small amount to an obvious and sudden gush. Sometimes, though, the blood stays in the uterus behind the placenta, so you might not see any bleeding at all.Most women will have some uterine tenderness or back pain. And in close to a quarter of cases, an abruption will cause the woman to go into labor prematurely.Pregnancy and low back pain Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:09Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:09Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosIf you have any signs of a placental abruption, you'll need to go to the hospital for a complete evaluation, including fetal heart rate monitoring and an ultrasound. (An ultrasound can't necessarily detect a small abruption, but it can rule out placenta previa, the other likely cause of uterine bleeding.)Since the bleeding may not be from the uterus, your practitioner will examine your vagina and cervix to see if the bleeding is from an infection, a laceration, a cervical polyp, or some other cause. She'll also check to see if your cervix is effacing or dilating, which can disrupt small veins and result in some bleeding.If you're Rh negative and you have any vaginal bleeding in your second or third trimester, you'll need a shot of Rh immune globulin, unless the biological father is also Rh negative.Call your practitioner immediately if you have any of these signs:Vaginal bleeding or spotting, or if your water breaks and the fluid is bloodyCramping, uterine tenderness, abdominal pain, or back painFrequent contractions or a contraction that doesn't endYour baby isn't moving as much as beforeCall 911 if you're bleeding heavily or have any signs of shock  if you feel weak, faint, pale, sweaty, or disoriented, or your heart is pounding.What will happen if I have a placental abruption?If you're near your due date, you'll need to deliver your baby right away, even if the abruption is minor, because the placenta could separate further at any time. If you're bleeding heavily or there are signs the baby is not getting enough oxygen, you'll have a c-section.However, if you have a small amount of bleeding that your provider suspects is from a minor abruption, and you and your baby are doing fine, you may be allowed to labor, as long as you're at a hospital where an emergency c-section can be done at the first sign of trouble.If your provider suspects that you have a minor abruption and your baby is very premature, you may be able to delay delivery a bit, as long as you and your baby are doing fine. At this point you have to weigh the risk of a worsening abruption against the risk of a premature birth.You may be given corticosteroids to speed the development of your baby's lungs and to prevent certain other problems related to prematurity. You'll stay in the hospital and be monitored continuously so your medical team can get your baby out at the first sign that the abruption is getting worse or that you or your baby is no longer doing fine.Who's most at risk for placental abruption?No one knows for sure what causes most cases of placental abruption, but the condition is more common in women who:Had an abruption in a previous pregnancy (and if you've had an abruption in two or more pregnancies, the risk is even higher)Have chronic hypertension, gestational hypertension, or preeclampsiaHave a blood clotting disorderHave their water break prematurelyHave too much amniotic fluid (polyhydramnios)Had bleeding earlier in their pregnancyAre carrying multiples (abruption is especially common just after the first baby is delivered)Are involved in an accident (particularly a car accident), are assaulted (with blows to the abdomen), or have other trauma to the abdomenSmoke tobacco or use methamphetamines or cocaine, or drink alcohol excessivelyHave had many babies or are older (the risk gradually goes up with age)Have a uterine abnormality or fibroids (particularly if there's a fibroid behind the place where the placenta is attached)Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2003 (reaffirmed in 2008).

Dads and breastfeeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_dads-and-breastfeeding_8252.bc,"Most expectant fathers know thatbreastfeedingis the best way to feed a baby. Breast milk contains the perfect blend ofnutrients and provides babies with a wide range of health benefits. Plus, breastfeeding is free, requires no preparation or cleanup, and is a great way for a mother to bond with her baby.But a lot of new fathers find that their feelings about breastfeeding change after the baby comes. It's not that dads don't support breastfeeding and its benefits  it's just that the whole experience makes them feel a little left out.Coping with feelings of inadequacy""Breastfeeding continues the exclusive relationship the mother and infant experienced during pregnancy,"" says Pamela Jordan, an associate professor in the Department of Family and Child Nursing at the University of Washington. (Jordan is one of the few researchers to explore the effects of breastfeeding on men.) For dads of breastfed babies, it's common to feel some or all of the following:Worry that you'll have a harder time bonding and developing a relationship with your baby than your partner willA sense of inadequacy, thinking that nothing you do for your child could ever compare to your partner's contributionResentmentof the baby who has physically ""come between"" you and your partnerBelief that because women breastfeed, they have knowledge and skills that automatically make them better parentsFive ways to make breastfeeding better for everyoneThere's no doubt about it: Feeding is one of the most important aspects of caring for an infant. And that means that if your partner isbreastfeeding, you may be at a bit of a disadvantage.But you don't have to back off just because she's got the food supply taken care of. Studies show that the moresupportive their partners are, the longer women breastfeed and the more confident they feel about their ability to do so.So while it may sound strange, dads have a very important role to play in breastfeeding. Here are a few specific ways you can help:Be supportive and thoughtful.Breastfeeding is hard work, so take on your partner's chores and help out whenever you can. When she's breastfeeding, bring her a pillow or a glass of water, or offer to burp your baby when he's done eating.Make sure to get a lot of skin-to-skin contact with your baby.Cuddling, bathing, and reading in a chair while your baby naps on your chest are allgreat relationship builders. And they'll give you and your little one a chance to bond in similar ways to the physical closeness breastfeeding brings.Spend plenty of time just hanging out with your baby.Take him for walks in the stroller, put him in asling or carrierand go grocery shopping, or play on the floor together. This will give you and your baby a chance to be alone, and the more this happens, the more confident you'll feel about your own abilities as a parent.Bottle-feed your baby with breast milk.Ifexpressing milkmanually or with a pump works for Mom, you canintroduce your baby to a bottleand start taking over at feeding times. (Before you start bottle-feeding, wait until your baby is at least 4 weeks old so that breastfeeding is well established. You want to give your baby a chance to get completely comfortable with nursing on a real breast first.)Try not to take it personally if your baby seems less than interested in taking a bottle from you at first. Plastic nipples, like real ones, come in all shapes and sizes. So you may have to do a little experimenting before you and your baby discover the kind he likes best.Be patient if your partner seems less interested in sex.She may feel all ""touched out"" from nursing your baby, and because nursing women have lower amounts of estrogen, she may have less vaginal lubrication. This can cause uncomfortable or painful intercourse. So instead of assuming that your partner isn't aroused by you anymore, stock up on a good water-based lubricant for when she isin the mood.Armin A.

When you just can't breastfeed,https://www.babycenter.com/0_when-you-just-cant-breastfeed_8485.bc,"When Bay Area parent Charlene Hedge gave birth to her son, she took it for granted that she would breastfeed him. But it was not to be. Hedge couldn't produce enough breast milk, and even though she fed her baby every hour in hopes of increasing her milk supply, her son still wasn't getting what he needed.""They always say breast milk is best,"" she says. ""That I couldn't provide for him bothered me for a bit.""Her son fussed constantly, frustrated and unhappy. And Hedge was exhausted by the hourly feedings. Three weeks later, after consulting her doctor, the nurses at the hospital, and her baby's doctor, she called it quits.""Nature just didn't work for me,"" says Hedge, whose son grew into a healthy, happy toddler. ""I could cry and get really depressed, but it wasn't going to change anything."" So she let the whole thing go.Whatever your reasons for not breastfeeding  health, intense discomfort, or unrelenting frustration  give yourself a break. ""Good parenting is more than breastfeeding,"" says Jan Barger, an international board certified lactation consultant (IBCLC).Did you try your best to nurse your baby? Did you turn to others  a lactation consultant, your midwife or doctor, your baby's doctor, your partner  for help? If so, chances are you've already exhausted all available resources and are doing what's best for you and your baby.What should I do now that I'm not breastfeeding?Give yourself a breakIf you've been dead set on breastfeeding since pregnancy, you're probably feeling disappointed. Just like moms who opt for natural childbirth but end up needing a cesarean, women who want to breastfeed but can't often feel a sense of failure and sometimes blame themselves.Try not to beat yourself up, but do take the time you need to feel sad, mad, or any other emotion you may be experiencing. ""Mourn your inability to breastfeed,"" says Barger. ""For some moms, this is a loss."" Avoid telling yourself that you should've tried for another day or another feeding. ""Some of us have a lot of stick-to-it-iveness,"" says Barger. ""But some just don't. And that's okay.""And even though experts say that breastfeeding is the best nutritional option for babies, it's not right  or possible  for every mother. In 2016, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reinforced the advice to breastfeed if at all possible, but said a woman's doctors should respect her opinion about whether breastfeeding is right for her.Today's commercially prepared formulas are nutritious and even contain some vitamins and nutrients that breastfed babies need to get from supplements, so if you can't breastfeed you can still feel confident that your baby is getting what she needs.Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.Talk about your feelingsIf you consulted a lactation expert through all your nursing troubles, talk to her. Be honest about your feelings. She'll likely offer soothing and consoling words that you should take to heart.Your spouse or partner, good friends, and family members can also be great sounding boards for your feelings. Take a chance and open up to them.Find out about donated breast milkIf your heart's set on feeding your baby breast milk and your child meets certain criteria  like being premature or ill  you may qualify for donated breast milk from a milk bank. Talk to your child's doctor about the possibilities.Can I still bond with my baby if I don't breastfeed?Absolutely. Breastfeeding is a wonderful way to strengthen your connection with your child, but it isn't the only way. At feeding time, hold your infant close to you and make eye contact.One client of Barger's who couldn't breastfeed ended up bottle-feeding her child as if she were nursing him. She held him in a breastfeeding position and had lots of skin-to-skin contact.Remember that your relationship with your child won't be based solely on your ability to nurse her. How you respond when she cries, how often you hold and play with her, and how you are as a parent matters more than how you feed her.Where can I turn for support?BabyCenter's Formula Feeding Mamas group is a great place to find other moms who are bottle-feeding, whether by choice or necessity.

Six reasons moms wean before they're really ready,https://www.babycenter.com/0_six-reasons-moms-wean-before-theyre-really-ready_8495.bc,"Everyone has an opinion about the ""right"" time to stop nursing, but weaning is an individual decision influenced by cultural norms, personal health issues, and family circumstances. Undoubtedly, some people in your life will say you've waited too long to make the transition from breast to bottle or cup, while others will question your decision to stop if you do so before the recommended one year. Here are six reasons that many nursing moms wean before they're ready and some ideas on how to stick with it.Breastfeeding hurts. I just don't think I can keep this up for a whole year.The first few weeks of breastfeeding can be difficult, especially if your newborn isn't latching on correctly. Figuring out the most comfortable holding position can take time too, adding to your overall discomfort. Have a lactation consultant come by to show you the ropes. While your baby will be nursing around the clock now, he'll start cutting back as he gets older. Many women find the first few weeks of breastfeeding tough, but those who persevere are glad they did.Learn more about surviving the first six weeks.I feel tied down by breastfeeding. I want my old life back.We hate to break it to you, but you'll never be the person you were before you had a child, whether you breastfeed or not. Yes, nursing your child is a commitment and it's common to feel trapped by your baby's constant demands. This can be particularly hard if you're used to being on the go all the time and in control of all aspects of your life. Try looking at breastfeeding as a rare opportunity to take a break from the fast track and bond with your child. Breastfeeding isn't forever, and you might be surprised at how fulfilling the experience can be.Learn more about adjusting to the breastfeeding life.My husband resents all the time I spend nursing.It's perfectly normal for your husband to feel left out of the breastfeeding equation, and to worry that your breasts are now off-limits. You can help him feel involved by letting him bottle-feed your child with pumped breast milk and encouraging him to spend lots time snuggling with the baby. Need more ideas? Read a dad's perspective on breastfeeding.Education and communication are also critical to winning your husband's support. Talk to him about the benefits of breastfeeding. These breastfeeding days will be gone before you know it, and you'll never be able to replace the vitamins and nutrients your child has missed out on. If your husband thinks formula is the way to go, remind him that formula is expensive and takes longer to prepare.Learn other ways to include your partner in breastfeeding.I'm at work all day and there's no place to pump privately.There's no question that working moms have their work cut out for them. The trend away from individual offices with doors to cubicles and common space in the workplace means no one has any privacy any more. But more women in the workplace means more employers are starting to accommodate nursing mothers. Talk to your boss or your human resources manager about your needs. It could be as easy as putting a chair or table in the company restroom, or getting permission to head out to your car a few times a day to pump.There's no easy solution if your workload leaves you crunched for time, or your work environment doesn't allow for pumping. You might also consider breastfeeding only in the morning and evening  your body can adjust to this schedule.See how other moms combined work and breastfeeding.No one else I know is still breastfeeding her baby.Are you a follower or a leader? Although it can be lonely being the only mother in a playgroup still nursing her baby, the scientific evidence is overwhelmingly in your favor. Good friends shouldn't give you a hard time. And those who do might need to be gently reminded of all the health benefits associated with breastfeeding, for you and your child.Find out how to make extended breastfeeding work for you.My mother thinks I'm coddling my child by continuing to breastfeed.The post-World War II formula-feeding generation frowned on breastfeeding. A lot has changed since then. Research has shown not only that breast milk boosts your baby's immune system, but that breastfeeding a child for a year or more doesn't lead to an overly dependent or clingy child; rather, it fosters independence and self-confidence. All toddlers are clingy to some degree. Breastfeeding can be a great source of comfort and reassurance as your child moves from one developmental phase to another, says Kathleen Huggins, BabyCenter's breastfeeding expert and author of The Nursing Mother's Companion."
Pyloric stenosis (forceful vomiting),https://www.babycenter.com/0_pyloric-stenosis-forceful-vomiting_10899.bc,"My newborn is vomiting forcefully after feeding. What's going on?All babies spit up  in that bubbly, wet-burp way. But forceful (or projectile) vomiting in a newborn is the hallmark symptom of pyloric stenosis. When a baby has pyloric stenosis, the muscle in the lower part of the stomach, called the pylorus, builds up and blocks the flow of food into the small intestine. There's no mistaking the gushing, which usually starts a few weeks after birth.If you see forceful vomiting, call your baby's doctor. Babies who can't keep food down need help quickly to avoid dehydration, weight loss, and other complications.How common is pyloric stenosis?About 1 in 500 babies develops pyloric stenosis, but it's rarely found in babies older than 6 months.The condition is more common in males (especially firstborn males) than in females, and in whites than in blacks, Hispanics, or Asians. If a parent had pyloric stenosis, the baby is more likely to have it.It's also found more often in babies who are given certain antibiotics (such as erythromycin) in the first weeks of life. Also, babies who are born to mothers who took certain antibiotics late in pregnancy and breastfeeding babies whose moms are taking certain antibiotics may also have an increased risk of pyloric stenosis.Are there other symptoms?Yes, if your baby has pyloric stenosis, he may also have:signs of dehydration, such as dry mouth, lethargy, and going for six hours without a wet diaperconstant hungerweight lossfewer bowel movements or bowel movements that are looser than usuala swollen tummyAfter your baby eats  and before he vomits  you may notice wavelike contractions across his upper abdomen as the stomach muscles try to push the food past the pylorus. You may also notice that your baby eagerly starts feeding and then becomes anxious and fretful before vomiting.What will the doctor do?After asking about your baby's symptoms and examining her, the doctor will probably take an ultrasound of her belly. This is a quick and painless procedure that uses sound waves to create a picture of the inside of her body.The doctor may order blood tests to find out whether your baby has a healthy level of electrolytes. He may also request a barium X-ray. Your baby will drink a bottle of a chalky solution containing barium, and then pictures will be taken of her pylorus in action.If it turns out that your baby does have pyloric stenosis, she'll need surgery. The operation, called a pyloromyotomy, involves making a single cut in the pyloric muscle. That's almost always enough to relax the valve so it behaves normally.If your baby shows any sign of dehydration, she'll need to spend some time hooked up to an intravenous (IV) tube  taking in fluids, sugars, and other nutrients  before the surgery.How risky is the surgery?It's pretty safe, as far as surgeries for babies go. Pyloromyotomy is a common surgery for newborns, so doctors get plenty of practice.How long until my baby comes home?Usually a day or two. Typically the IV is removed the day after surgery and the baby can get back on breast milk or formula once the IV fluids are discontinued. Your baby's tummy may be sore for a day or two after the operation.Don't be surprised by an occasional eruption after the procedure. Most babies who've had the surgery vomit forcefully a few more times, and the sight of it so soon can be frightening. It's nothing to worry about, though.If your baby is still spouting more than a couple of days after the operation, however, it's time to call the doctor. Chances are slim, but your baby may be in that 1 to 2 percent who need a second procedure.Does pyloric stenosis have long-term effects?Almost never. After the surgery, the pylorus should function normally, showing no sign of its still abnormal size.Show sources Hide sources Mayo Clinic. Undated.

Bottle-feeding basics for formula-fed babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_bottle-feeding-basics-for-formula-fed-babies_14286.bc,"How often should I feed my baby?As with breastfeeding, most experts agree that you shouldn't follow a rigid schedule in the early weeks, though you may be able to work out an approximate pattern for feeding within a month or so. Offer a bottle every two to three hours at first, or as your baby seems hungry.When your baby is about a month old, she'll be ready to eat on a schedule. Formula-fed infants tend to be heavier than breastfed babies, so following a feeding schedule can help prevent them from overeating.Feed your baby once every three to four hours. Until she reaches about 10 pounds, she'll probably take 1.5 to 3 ounces per feeding. Don't force her to take more than she seems ready to eat. Your baby's doctor can advise you about how much your baby should eat as she grows.Do I need to sterilize the bottles?Doctors used to advise sterilizing bottle-feeding supplies back when the safety of water supplies was less reliable. This isn't as much of a concern now, but it's best to play it safe and ask your child's doctor if she thinks sterilization is necessary.If your doctor recommends sterilizing your supplies before the first use, submerge new bottles, nipples, and rings in a pot of boiling water for at least five minutes. Then let them air dry on a clean towel. After that, a good hand-washing with soapy water or a cycle through the dishwasher is sufficient. (You can find handy bottle gear  such as drying racks and dishwasher baskets for nipples, rings, and bottle caps  online or at baby supply stores.)Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.If you have well water, or if your local health department says your tap water is unsafe for drinking, you'll probably need to sterilize bottles before every use.A note about plastics: Some studies have found that plastic baby bottles contain chemicals which may leach into the formula, especially when the bottle is heated. You can avoid this risk by using bottles made of stainless steel or glass. If you decide to use plastic bottles, don't boil them, heat them in the microwave, or wash them in the dishwasher. Instead, hand wash them with a bottle brush and warm, soapy water. Learn more about the safety of plastic baby bottles.Do I need to sterilize my drinking water for making formula?Many parents do sterilize the water used to mix formula, especially in the newborn months, but you don't need to unless your child's doctor recommends it. However, if you use well water or your tap water is unsafe for drinking, you'll need to sterilize it or use bottled water for mixing formula.If you do choose to boil the water you use to mix formula, save yourself time by preparing enough in the morning for the whole day. Bring cold water to a rolling boil and let it boil for just one minute. Let it cool to room temperature for no longer than 30 minutes, mix enough formula for the next 24 hours, and refrigerate it immediately. Discard any formula that isn't used within 24 hours.What's the best way to warm a bottle?There's no health reason to warm formula, though your baby may prefer it. When you're ready to feed your baby, you can warm a bottle in a bowl of hot  not boiling  water, or by running it under the tap. You can also buy a bottle warmer designed for this purpose. Always test the formula by shaking a few drops on the inside of your wrist to make sure it's not too hot for your baby.If your baby is accustomed to drinking bottles at room temperature or slightly cold, you save yourself the time and hassle of preheating bottles, especially when she's crying to be fed right now.Caution: Never use a microwave to heat a bottle of formula. A microwave heats unevenly, so it can create hot pockets and lead to burns. Microwave heating can also cause the nutrients in formula to break down. Also, if you use plastic bottles, warm formula by putting the bottle in a bowl of warm  not hot  water or run it under warm water.For more bottle-feeding basics, visit these articles:Choosing nipples and bottles for formula feedingHow much formula your baby needsBreastfeeding and supplementing with formulaHow to use baby formula safelyShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Gas pain (ages 3 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_gas-pain-ages-3-to-8_66306.bc,"How can I help relieve my child's indigestion or tell if it's something more serious?Intestinal gas is a perfectly normal occurrence in children and in adults. (We grown-ups pass, on average, 2 liters of gas a day.) In most cases, it isn't a cause for concern, unless your child is experiencing more than minor discomfort and complaining a lot. The best thing you can do is to try to eliminate or manage the offending food or habit that's triggering your child's gas. When your child does have uncomfortable gas pain, you can give him an ant-acid (such as Mylanta Supreme) as well as an anti-gas agent (such as Mylicon) to reduce upper and lower gastrointestinal discomfort. But if you find yourself treating your child several times a day for more than three consecutive days, or his gas coincides with other symptoms, such as vomiting, diarrhea, or fever, call your doctor. Your child might have a more serious condition such as a food allergy or lactose intolerance.How can I tell what's causing my child's gas?There could be several factors causing your child to have more gas or indigestion than usual:Roaming around during mealsMany time-crunched parents today find that we'll do anything to get our kids to eat right, including letting them meander around house, watch television, or even roughhouse during meals. Not a good idea. ""When kids roam and play while they eat, they can get excited and trap air in their intestinal tracts,"" says Michael Hart, director of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition at Carilion Medical Center for Children in Roanoke, Virginia.Odds are, if your child is a roamer, he eats fast or gulps so his chewing doesn't impede his playing, which also increases air consumption and isn't good for digestion. (It can also increase his risk of choking.) And if he has meals while watching television, he might ignore his body's signals that he's full and overeat. Encourage your child to sit at the table with you during meals, chew his food well, and take his time when he eats. Reassure him that when he's done, he can play as long as he wants to.Eating a lot of high-fiber foods, like cereal, or fatty foods, like French friesSome children's guts may be sensitive to fiber or fat. Take note of which types of foods bring on your child's bouts of gastrointestinal distress and try limiting them. You might also discuss his diet with your pediatrician, who could have other suggestions.Chewing gumThe artificial sweeteners in sugar-free gum are difficult for some children to digest. They get trapped in the colon and are fermented into intestinal gas. Chewing gum also increases the odds of swallowing excess air. Try your best to limit your child's gum chewing.Eating certain vegetablesLike adults, children can experience additional gas when they eat vegetables like beans, broccoli, and cauliflower. If your child eats these healthy foods, that's a good thing. Just make sure you don't overload him with too many gas-inducing veggies at consecutive meals.Drinking a lot of juiceIn general, parents misunderstand the benefits of giving kids juice. If your child is drinking more than a glass a day, it might be causing him to have a little extra gas. Some children have a difficult time digesting the fructose and sucrose in juice. As a result, it can bring on gas, even diarrhea, and make a child feel too full come mealtime. Plus, it bathes the teeth in sugar. Ideally, a child over the age of 3 shouldn't be drinking more than one 6- to 8-oz. glass of juice a day.Drinking a lot of sodaCarbonated drinks like soda contain phosphoric acid, which can cause excessive gas and indigestion. Soda also tends to make children feel full, so they don't drink the necessary milk and water they should or get all the nutrients they need throughout the day. Try to discourage your child from drinking soda at all or at least limit it to special occasions or birthday parties.Not drinking enough waterDrinking water won't eliminate your child's gas problem, but it will help improve any constipation or difficulty he might have passing stools (constipation often coincides with gas and abdominal discomfort). Make sure your child has several glasses of water each day in addition to the milk or juice you give him.Source: Dr. Michael Hart, director of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition at Carilion medical Center for Children in Roanoke, Virginia"

Roasted butternut squash & kale lasagna,https://www.babycenter.com/0_roasted-butternut-squash-kale-lasagna_10414016.bc,"Lasagna  comforting and delicious, as well as easy to reheat  is a classic drop-off meal for anyone who could use a hand, including new parents. This veggie version gets a boost from superfoods butternut squash and kale. For even more tasty nutrients, throw a mixed green salad in a bag and pack a small jar of dressing to serve on the side.You can use a 9-by-13-inch (23-by-28 cm) or an 8-inch (20-cm) square baking pan, instead of a baking dish. Whatever you bake it in, just cut the noodles to fit its size and shape. To make it extra easy to serve and store, cut the lasagna into smaller portions.Featured in: Delicious drop-off dinners for new parentsIngredients4 cups (about 1 lb/750 g) peeled, seeded, and cubed butternut squash3 tablespoons olive oilSalt and freshly ground pepper8 fresh sage leaves1 bunch (about 8 large leaves) kale15 oz (470 g) whole-milk ricotta cheese1 cup (4 oz/125 g) shredded mozzarella cheese, plus 2 tablespoons cup (2 oz/60 g) grated pecorino Romano or Parmesan cheese1 large egg lb (250 g) lasagna noodles1 can (14 oz/455 g) diced tomatoes, drainedPreparationPreheat the oven to 450F (230C). Line a heavy-duty baking sheet with parchment paper.Pile the squash on the prepared pan and drizzle with 2 tablespoons of the olive oil. Season generously with salt and pepper and toss to coat. Spread the squash out in a single layer. Tear the sage leaves in half and scatter on top. Roast in the oven until fork-tender, about 25 minutes, stirring once about halfway through. Let the squash cool slightly, and then carefully transfer to a food processor fitted with the metal blade and process to a smooth puree (or, using a potato masher, smash it on the pan or in a bowl until smooth). Set aside.Lower the oven temperature to 375F (190C).Bring a pot of salted water to a boil over high heat. Spray a baking sheet with cooking spray and place nearby.While the water is heating, rinse the kale and pat dry with paper towels or spin dry in a salad spinner. Remove and discard any tough stems and cut the leaves into 2-inch (5-cm) pieces. In a large frying pan, warm the remaining 1 tablespoon olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the kale, season with salt and pepper, and cook, stirring constantly, just until the kale begins to wilt, about 2 minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside.In a bowl, stir together the ricotta, the 1 cup mozzarella,  cup (1 oz/30 g) of the pecorino Romano, and the egg. Season with salt and pepper and set aside.Add the lasagna noodles to the boiling water a few at a time, stir once or twice to prevent sticking, and cook until al dente, about 4 minutes. As each batch is finished, using tongs, transfer the noodles to the oiled baking sheet and lay flat.Coat the bottom and sides of a 2-qt (2-l) baking dish with cooking spray. Spread one-third of the squash puree over the bottom of the dish and top with a single layer of noodles. Top the noodles with half each of the ricotta mixture, the remaining squash puree, the tomatoes, and the kale. Top again with a layer of noodles and then repeat the process with the remaining ricotta mixture, squash puree, and kale (reserve the tomatoes). Place one final layer of noodles on top, scatter the remaining tomatoes over all, and finish with the 2 tablespoons mozzarella and remaining  cup pecorino Romano.Cover the dish loosely with aluminum foil and bake for 25 minutes. Carefully remove the foil and continue to bake until the cheese on top is melted and lightly browned and the juices are bubbly, about 10 minutes longer. Let cool slightly before cutting into squares for serving or in half crosswise for two smaller lasagnas.To pack: Let the lasagna cool and cover tightly. For smaller portions, let cool in the pan completely, then carefully transfer each to a large sheet of aluminum foil and wrap tightly, or transfer to airtight storage containers. The lasagna will keep for up to 3 days in the refrigerator or 3 months in the freezer.To reheat: Bake in a preheated 350F (180C) oven until warmed through and bubbly, 10 to 15 minutes for refrigerated lasagna, or up to an hour for frozen. Individual pieces of room-temperature lasagna can be warmed on a plate for a minute or two in the microwave.Makes 6 servingsPhotos by Thayer Allyson Gowdy"
My breastfeeding story: Forced to quit after a medical crisis,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-forced-to-quit-after-a-medical-crisis_10414439.bc,"Name: AmberLives in: Marion, IndianaBreastfeeding experience: Unexpectedly difficultMain challenges: Preemie delivery, low supply, and postpartum complicationsBreastfed for: 3 monthsMy storyI had twins at age 27 and was dead set on breastfeeding. I had to be induced at 35 weeks because I was preeclamptic, and they were born at 3 pounds, 3 ounces  tiny but perfectly healthy.I, on the other hand, wasn't doing so well. My placenta had grown through my uterus, and I needed three surgeries and 20 units of blood. The doctors told me I wouldn't be breastfeeding because my body was in a state of shock and couldn't produce milk. I prayed and prayed, and I did produce some.I had to pump since my babies were too young to nurse. At first I was only getting an ounce at the most, and it took several weeks to make more. My twins were fed my breast milk through a tube, and the nurses added fortifiers to give them more calories and nutrients. When that still wasn't enough, we had to supplement with formula.They ate every three hours, so I pumped every three hours. It was so much work. I wasn't producing as much milk as I wanted to, partly because they were too frail to nurse (the doctors didn't want them to expend energy nursing and lose weight) and without them nursing, my body wasn't properly stimulated to make more milk. I was heartbroken about having to supplement with formula, but I wanted them to survive and I wanted them to come home, so we did what we had to.Finally, 6 weeks later, I was able to nurse my babies. It was like winning a race! But even after nursing, I could tell they were still hungry. I felt very defeated. So the doctors said for me to supplement with formula after each feeding and to keep trying. They were so encouraging!But then they discovered that I still had remnants of my placenta in my uterus. That was hindering milk production since my body was getting signals that I was still pregnant. So they wanted to do another surgery, but they couldn't operate. I had lost 20 units of blood during my delivery, and my body was in such a fragile state  I wasn't medically stable yet. I was put on medication that would filter into my breast milk, and we didn't want the babies to get it, so I had to stop breastfeeding. We switched to formula.I was devastated. It sent me into a horrible postpartum depression. I felt like my body failed me and failed my babies. I wasn't ready to let go.I was put on antidepressants, and I joined a support group for moms. Many of the moms in the group had twins, and hearing other women talk about how it didn't go their way either made me feel more normal. It helped me let go of feeling like a failure, and the formula nourished them. They couldn't take regular formula; they had to get a specially formulated one, so I knew they were getting just what they needed.Because of the scar tissue that formed in my uterus, I was told I'd probably never get pregnant again. But when the twins were 2, I had another child! I breastfed my daughter for 20 months, and I thank God for that experience because it gave me closure on what happened with the twins. I realized that my body didn't fail me  it's just what happened.My biggest lesson learnedIf I could tell myself any advice from the beginning, it's to not have a picture in my mind of what breastfeeding should look like. And if it doesn't work out, there's always a plan B. Plan B is still beautiful. You can still bond with your baby with a bottle.Back to all breastfeeding essays"
The fourth trimester: Your baby's first three months,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-fourth-trimester-your-babys-first-three-months_10415518.bc,"What is the ""fourth trimester""?You probably thought you were finished with trimesters when you had your baby. But the word ""trimester"" can also be used to describe the first three months after birth, from day one to the day your baby turns 3 months old.In the fourth trimester, your tiny daughter or son has just moved from the familiar comfort and noises of your warm, dark womb to a bright environment full of unsettling new sights, sounds, smells, and sensations, as well as shifting temperatures.This period of adjustment to the world outside your womb is a time of enormous change and development. There's so much for your little one to get started on, from refining and developing all her senses and controlling her reflexes to learning how to respond to you and your partner.A huge transition for your new babyNewborns have only their instincts and reflexes to control their behavior and movement. Some of their senses are still developing, and they have to start learning to interpret the sensory information that's flooding in.They can see, but their vision is blurred.They can hear, but they can't yet understand the meaning of the sounds they're hearing.They can feel, but the reassuring and snug comfort of the womb has been replaced by disconcerting open space.A second a day: from birth to 3 months Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:07Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:07Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all baby videosYour baby's brain is well developed at birth, but it's far from mature. It's like a sponge, soaking up everything that happens. The more the brain is stimulated at this stage, the more synapses (connections) will form. (Synapses are the pathways between brain cells that enable us to think.)At some point in the fourth trimester, you'll probably notice your baby:Breathing more steadily, startling less, and developing more controlled movements.Settling into more consistent sleep and feeding patterns.Learning to self-soothe.Interacting with family and friends, objects, or music with greater attention and for longer periods of time.By the end of your baby's fourth trimester, you will have seen a remarkable physical, mental, and social transformation take place.New-baby highlights: behavior & movementHere's a snapshot of just a few of the important behaviors and abilities you can expect from your baby in the first three months when it comes to crying, sleeping, feeding, and beginning to move. To find out more about baby growth and development during the fourth trimester, read up on baby milestones.CryingYour baby is likely to cry more during the fourth trimester than at any other time in his or her life.Crying helps babies survive and thrive in various ways:It's the closest thing they have to verbal communication, giving them a way to ask for help when they're hungry or uncomfortable.It helps them block noises, visual stimulation, and other feelings that are too intense.It releases tension.Find out why babies cry and how to soothe them.SleepingNew babies sleep a lot, especially in the early weeks. Sleeping is good for them. It helps the brain process all the wonderful sensory stimulation they're taking in from you and their environment when they're awake.The youngest babies have little sense of day and night, and they rarely stay asleep for more than two to four hours at a time. Sleeping more at night instead of on and off around-the-clock is a new habit that takes time to learn.Fortunately for sleep-deprived parents, by 6 to 8 weeks of age, babies have typically started sleeping less during the day and more at night. But most will still wake up for middle-of-the-night feedings for some time to come.Baby sleep: Bedtime routines Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:50Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:50Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all baby videosFeedingNewborns are too young for a feeding routine. They have tiny stomachs, so they eat (and by ""eat"" we mean ""drink"") small amounts frequently.Gradually, as their tummy gets bigger, babies can take in more at each feeding and eat less often. If your baby suddenly seems hungrier than usual, he's probably having a growth spurt. Growth spurts will happen periodically. For example, babies typically have growth spurts around seven to 10 days after birth and between 3 and 6 weeks of age.Don't be surprised if your little one spits up. He's just learning to eat, and  considering how tiny he is  he's swallowing and digesting a ton of nutrient-rich breast milk or formula. He's bound to overflow from time to time.Using their bodyAt birth, your baby is almost completely helpless, physically. But babies start developing motor skills and muscles from day one.When placed on her tummy, your baby will naturally learn to lift her head, push up with her tiny arms, roll over, and so on  developing strength and coordination as she grows. You can start tummy time in your baby's first week of life, whenever your baby is awake.Show sources Hide sources California Childcare Health Program, Childcare Healthline, 2001.

Is preeclampsia preventable?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_is-preeclampsia-preventable_10415691.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineNo one knows for sure whether preeclampsia can be prevented since the cause of the condition is unknown. It's likely that different factors are involved. Although it's hard to give clear advice about how to prevent preeclampsia, you can take steps to lower your risk.Most experts believe that preeclampsia happens when the placenta isn't working as well as it should. The placenta connects the baby to the uterus by the umbilical cord. It supplies a baby with oxygen and nutrients, and removes waste.About 5 percent of pregnant women develop preeclampsia, but some women have a higher risk than others. At your first prenatal appointment, your provider will take a detailed medical history to evaluate your risk.What are the risk factors for preeclampsia?The risk factors for preeclampsia include:Being obese (having a body mass index, or BMI, of 30 or higher) at the start of your pregnancyHaving a family or personal history of preeclampsiaExpecting twins or moreBeing age 35 or olderHaving in vitro fertilization (IVF)Having an autoimmune condition, such as lupusHaving another chronic condition, such as high blood pressure before pregnancy (chronic hypertension), kidney disease, or diabetes (type 1 or 2)Having the blood-clotting disorder thrombophiliaExpecting your first babyIf you have any of these risk factors, talk to your healthcare provider. There may be ways to lower your chance of developing preeclampsia, either before you become pregnant or during pregnancy.What can I do before pregnancy to lower the risk of preeclampsia?Some risk factors  like your age or the number of babies you're carrying  are out of your control. But you can change other risk factors. If you're overweight, for example, losing weight before you get pregnant may reduce your risk of getting preeclampsia.Getting pre-existing medical conditions under good control now also helps reduce your risk of complications during pregnancy so you and your baby stay healthy. If you have a long-term medical condition, such as high blood pressure or diabetes, schedule a preconception checkup with your provider. Because preeclampsia involves an increase in blood pressure, women who already have high blood pressure are at greater risk of developing the condition. If you have diabetes, it's important that your blood sugar levels are well controlled before you become pregnant.Your options for making lifestyle changes and taking medication are often limited once you're pregnant, so use the time before pregnancy to do everything you can to maximize your health.What can I do during pregnancy to lower the risk of preeclampsia?Once you're pregnant, be sure to attend all your prenatal appointments. At each visit, your provider takes your blood pressure and may check your urine for protein, which can be a sign of preeclampsia. If you have an especially high risk of developing preeclampsia, your provider may recommend that you take a low dose (81 milligrams) of aspirin daily during pregnancy.Research shows that starting low-dose aspirin at the end of your first trimester can reduce your chance of developing preeclampsia if you're at increased risk. (Don't take any drug when you're pregnant without checking with your provider first.)In the event that you develop the condition, you can start treatment immediately.What are the symptoms of preeclampsia?It's also important to know the symptoms of preeclampsia, so you can watch for them between appointments. Call your provider right away if you have:Swelling of your hands or faceSudden weight gainVision problems, such as blurring and seeing spots or flashesSevere pain below your ribsDifficulty breathingA severe headache that won't go awayNausea and vomitingDo supplements help prevent preeclampsia?There's little to no evidence that supplements can prevent preeclampsia, even though you may find lists of recommendations when searching online for ways to avoid the condition.Some research shows calcium could help prevent preeclampsia in women who don't get enough of the mineral. But most Americans already get the recommended amount of 1,000 milligrams daily from their diet, so the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists doesn't recommend extra calcium for healthy women in the United States.Some women have also tried taking Vitamin C, E, or fish oils to prevent preeclampsia, but again, there's no evidence that these supplements have a beneficial effect. Unless your provider specifically advises otherwise, a regular prenatal vitamin containing folic acid is all you need.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information about preeclampsia and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2013.

My breastfeeding story: Exhausting but worth it,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-exhausting-but-worth-it_10419214.bc,"Name: AshleyLives in: Tucker, GeorgiaBreastfeeding experience: Unprepared for how exhausting and complicated breastfeeding can beMain challenges: Finding a good nursing rhythm, keeping up a reliable milk supply, fitting many pumping sessions into a single workdayBreastfed for: 14 months and countingMy storyBefore my daughter was born, I decided to breastfeed to save money. It was as simple as that. Then I took a lactation course and watched latching videos on YouTube and learned about the skin-to-skin bonding that comes from breastfeeding. The more research I did, the more into it I got.By the time Harper was born, I felt ready  but she wasn't. She had trouble latching onto my breast at first. She fussed. Our skin-to-skin bonding didn't last as long as I wanted it to. But we hung in there and she found a way to nurse.For the first month Harper nursed every one to three hours. I found it exhausting, partly because I had a hard time establishing a rhythm. She'd nurse for maybe five minutes and then cry, breaking her hold on my breast, and I'd have to put her back on the same breast to finish.Also, her poop was green when it should have been mustard colored and I got stressed out thinking she wasn't getting the nutrients she needed.I did more research and decided to try block feeding so she'd get the fattier milk she seemed to need. This meant limiting her to only one breast for three hour blocks of time, which seemed to work for her.(Editor's note: Block feeding is typically recommended only if a mother has an oversupply of milk and a baby is gaining weight too quickly, fussy and gassy, or has reflux symptoms. Mothers who block feed require monitoring because milk production slows when a baby is limited to only one breast for three hour blocks of time.)When I returned to my job as a health scientist, I organized my work schedule so I could pump three times a day, which is pretty demanding. Still, when Harper was seven or eight months old my milk supply started falling off. So I increased my pumping to four or five times a day, including getting up an hour before she woke.At 10 months I saw another dip and almost moved to formula. But I decided to give it one last try instead. I added yet another pumping session to my day, and my milk came back.Before having Harper, my biggest worry about breastfeeding had been developing thrush, which makes nipples sore. Everyone said it was so painful! I didn't get thrush, but I developed a bacterial infection when Harper was about 13 months old, which made nursing very uncomfortable. I took antibiotics and after a month it cleared up.Now, I'm sort of done breastfeeding. I'm tired of going out with Harper and having her reach for my shirt. I'm also just tired. I'm weaning her slowly and don't offer her the breast anymore. But she's still reaching for it, even if sometimes she just nurses for two minutes. I'm trying to go with the flow but it's exhausting.Breastfeeding has certainly been harder than I expected. But I'm so into the whole idea of it that I'm going back to school to get certified as a lactation consultant! I just got accepted into a program and will take my courses online. I know I'll be tired because I'm working and I'm a mom, but I'm also very excited. Whatever a woman's goal is with breastfeeding, I want to be there to help her be successful.My biggest lesson learnedKeep your eyes on the prize, which in my case meant giving my daughter the full benefit of breastfeeding. While I never had any major problems, I went through some tough times trying to keep Harper fed. What kept me going was my commitment to feeding her without using formula.Back to all breastfeeding essays"

Bottle-feeding basics,https://www.babycenter.com/0_bottle-feeding-basics_752.bc,"How often should I feed my baby?Most experts agree that you shouldn't follow a rigid feeding schedule in the early weeks, though you may be able to work out an approximate pattern within a month or two.Offer your breast or the bottle every two to three hours at first or as your baby seems hungry. Until your baby reaches about 10 pounds, she'll probably take one to three ounces per feeding.Don't force more than she seems ready to eat. Your baby's doctor should advise you about suitable amounts for your child as she grows.Baby bottles and nipples buying guide (Before You Buy series) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 3:08Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -3:08Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosDo I need to sterilize the bottles?Before you first use new bottles, nipples, and rings, sterilize them by submerging them in a pot of boiling water for at least five minutes. Then let them air dry on a clean towel. After that, a good cleaning in hot, soapy water or a cycle through the dishwasher is sufficient.Two exceptions: One, if you have well water, it may be best to continue sterilizing the bottles. And two, to minimize exposure to harmful chemicals, don't boil plastic baby bottles, heat them in the microwave, or wash them in the dishwasher.Plastic bottles are made with bisphenol A and other chemicals that are released when heated. When these chemicals are released, they may end up in your baby's milk or formula.You can find handy bottle-feeding gear, such as bottle drying racks and dishwasher baskets for nipples, rings, and bottle caps, at most baby supply stores.Find out how to choose bottles and nipples and when to replace them.Guide to Firsts: Bottle feeding7 keys to feeding your baby with a bottle.Can I mix breast milk and formula?There's nothing wrong with mixing breast milk and formula in the same container, but it's not recommended simply because you don't want to waste a single drop of your precious breast milk if you're pumping and supplementing with formula. A good plan is to feed your baby whatever breast milk you've expressed, and then follow that up with an ounce or two of formula if you need it. Find out more.What's the best way to warm a bottle?There's no health reason to warm the milk first, but your baby may prefer it. When you're ready to feed your baby, you can heat up the bottle in a bowl of warm  not hot or boiling  water, or by running it under the tap. You can also buy a bottle warmer designed for this purpose.If your baby is accustomed to drinking bottles at room temperature or slightly cold, you save yourself the time and hassle of preheating bottles, especially when she's crying to be fed.Never use a microwave to heat a bottle of breast milk or formula. A microwave oven heats unevenly, so it can create hot pockets and lead to burns. It can also cause nutrients to break down.How can I make sure my baby is drinking comfortably?Like so much with babies, you'll need to listen and observe. If you hear a lot of noisy sucking sounds while she drinks, she may be taking in too much air. To help your baby swallow less air, hold her at a 45-degree angle. Also take care to tilt the bottle so that the nipple and neck are always filled with breast milk or formula.Never prop a bottle - it can cause your baby to choke. Besides, bottle-feeding, like breastfeeding, can be a wonderful time for nurturing your baby by holding her close. So take feeding time as an opportunity to snuggle and bond.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011a. Amount and schedule of formula feedings.

How long does it take to get pregnant?,https://www.babycenter.com/how-long-does-it-take-to-get-pregnant,"No one can say exactly how long it'll take you to get pregnant. But we can tell you how long it typically takes couples to conceive  and how you can speed things along.How long it takes to conceiveThe majority of couples get pregnant within three months. Your own timeline could be longer if you're older, have certain fertility-unfriendly habits (like smoking), or have a condition that impairs fertility.Of all couples trying to conceive:30 percent get pregnant within the first cycle (about one month)59 percent get pregnant within three cycles (about three months)80 percent get pregnant within six cycles (about six months)85 percent get pregnant within 12 cycles (about one year)91 percent get pregnant within 36 cycles (about three years)93 to 95 percent get pregnant within 48 cycles (about four years)If you try for a year without success, it's smart to seek help from a fertility specialist. You might conceive on your own if you keep trying, but in case you have an underlying fertility problem, it's best to get help so you don't waste valuable years as your biological clock continues to tick.If you're 35 or older, time is even more precious and you should get help sooner: Set up an appointment with a specialist if you're not pregnant within six months.Am I Pregnant?Take our quiz and find out.About 80 to 90 percent of couples conceive naturally. Ten percent are eventually diagnosed with infertility. (About 93 to 95 percent of couples probably could conceive naturally if they tried long enough. It's just that some get help rather than waiting to find out.)An ""infertility"" diagnosis simply means one year of trying without success in women under age 35 or six months of trying without success in women age 35 or older. Once couples diagnosed with infertility get medical help, a good number of them do manage to get pregnant. The rest typically end up considering other options, like sperm donation, surrogacy, or adoption.How age affects pregnancy ratesThe older you get, the longer it may take you to get pregnant. Thats primarily because your eggs tend to decrease in quality as they age. (They've been with you since you were born.) That means fewer of them are able to join with a sperm and grow into a healthy baby. Interestingly, male fertility rates dont appear to start to decline until around age 50.After one year of trying, about 86 percent of healthy, fertile women in their early 20s will get pregnant. The rate drops to about 63 percent among healthy, fertile women in their early 30s, and 36 percent among healthy, fertile women in their early 40s. By age 45, close to 0 percent of women are able to get pregnant naturally.Read more about the pros, cons, and likelihood of getting pregnant in your 20s, 30s, and 40s.Ovulation CalculatorFind out when you're likely to ovulate  and boost your chances of conceiving.Can I get pregnant faster?Happily, the answer is yes. Here are a few steps you can take to speed things along.First, figure out when you'll ovulate. You can only get pregnant when you ovulate (release an egg from one or your ovaries). There are a few different methods you can try to help pinpoint when you'll ovulate.Next, time sex with ovulation. Studies show that couples who schedule sex to coincide with ovulation get pregnant faster. (The best time to have sex is from two to three days before ovulation through the day you ovulate.)In one study, the pregnancy rates of couples who timed intercourse with ovulation were higher than typically seen among couples trying to conceive:38 percent were pregnant after one cycle (up from 30 percent)68 percent were pregnant after three cycles (up from 59 percent)81 percent were pregnant after six cycles (up from 80 percent)92 percent were pregnant after 12 cycles (up from 91 percent)Find out more about the importance of timing sex for conception. To check your understanding, take our quiz.Meanwhile, get your body ready for pregnancy. Your general and reproductive health are both important factors in fertility, so schedule a preconception checkup with a doctor or midwife. Give up smoking, illicit drugs, excessive alcohol consumption, and high amounts of caffeine. Learn which nutrients your body needs for pregnancy and stock up on the right foods. Also, see how being overweight or underweight can hurt your chances of conceiving.How can I get pregnant quickly?

Picky eaters: The Carbo Loader,https://www.babycenter.com/0_picky-eaters-the-carbo-loader_10331648.bc,"When faced with a picky eater, how do you ensure your child gets the nutrients she needs - without a fight. Our food experts offer strategies and recipes for your carbo loader.See all eight picky eaters here.The Carbo LoaderThe dilemma: You offer your kids a balanced diet, but they only go for the bread, pasta, crackers, and chips.The nutritional concern: Without a doubt, kids need carbohydrates for energy. But not all carbs are created equal. Complex carbs, such as cereal, whole grain bread, and some fruits and vegetables, provide fiber and take a while to break down in the body so you don't feel hungry right away. But refined or simple carbs, including foods like white bread, cakes, and cookies, have added sugars and fewer nutrients. They can make blood sugar spike and drop sharply.Missy Chase Lapine, mother of two and author of The Sneaky Chef: Simple Strategies for Hiding Healthy Foods in Kids' Favorite Meals: The carbo loader describes a lot of picky eaters and most of those carbohydrates are white and refined. You can do better. For example, you can now buy whole wheat ""white"" bread made from white wheat (instead of the red wheat that's used to make brown whole wheat bread).Ann Cooper, nutrition expert who revamps school cafeterias around the country and coauthor of Lunch Lessons: Changing the Way We Feed Our Children: Our kids are not allowed to load up on just carbs. We see our role as educators, so we explain why they need to have a balanced meal. And we mix our carbs  semolina and whole grain pasta together  to enhance the nutritional content. Don't forget other whole grains, such as bulgur and whole-wheat couscous, to mix it up a little.Jessica Seinfeld, mother of three and author of Deceptively Delicious: Simple Secrets to Get Your Kids Eating Good Food: Courses, courses, courses. If your child is hungry, she'll eat what you serve first. That's why I often start with a plate of raw veggies and dip and save the carbs for last.Vicki Lansky, mother of two, grandmother of three, and author of Feed Me I'm Yours: Find ways to make the carbohydrates more nutritious. Add a thin smear of peanut butter to that bread. Serve fried rice with egg and little pieces of vegetables. Hide vegetables in baked goods  like zucchini in muffins  or carrots, squash, and tomatoes in pasta sauce. Thank goodness for blenders.Ellyn Satter, mother of three, grandmother of six, and author of Secrets of Feeding a Healthy Family: One of those preferred foods should be served at each meal, along with others, without comment.Jennifer Iserloh, private chef and author of Secrets of a Skinny Chef: Think about portion control. I see kids eating giant white bagels. Instead, find child-size mini bagels and pitas. (If a certain food can't fit in the palm of a kid's hand, it's probably too much.) Go for whole grains over refined, and get a little low-fat cream cheese on top to boost its nutritional value. Likewise, mix some Parmesan cheese and pureed vegetables into that pasta, and make it whole grain.Vegetable Lo MeinBy Ann CooperPasta is always a hit with kids, and lo mein is no different. If you want to make this dish a main course, add protein in the form of tofu, chicken, or pork. This dish is an excellent choice for the lunch box because it can be eaten warm or at room temperature, and extra marinating makes the noodles more flavorful.Ingredients:3/4 pound lo mein noodles1 to 2 tablespoons sesame oil, as needed2 tablespoons plus 3/4 teaspoon cup hoisin sauce2 1/2 tablespoons soy sauce2 tablespoons canola oil1 1/2 tablespoons minced fresh ginger1 1/2 tablespoons minced garlic1/3 cup sliced scallions1 cup julienned carrots1 cup thinly sliced celery1 cup thinly sliced red onion3/4 cup bean sprouts3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantroInstructions:Cook lo mein noodles in salted water according to package directions. Let cool and toss lightly with enough sesame oil to prevent the noodles from sticking together.In a separate bowl, combine the hoisin and soy sauces and mix well.In a wok or a large frying pan, heat some canola oil and quickly saute the ginger, garlic, and scallions until they release aroma. Then add the carrots, celery, and red onions and briefly saute before adding the bean sprouts.In a smaller frying pan, heat some more canola oil and saute the noodles. When they are hot and look lightly browned, combine them with the other sauteed ingredients.Add the soy sauce mixture to evenly coat the stir-fry.Garnish with chopped cilantro and serve.Makes 8 servings. Chicken and RiceBy Ellyn SatterThere is no easier way to cook for a family than to make an oven meal. A well-constructed oven meal does most of the last-minute work for you. You just take it out of the oven and put it on the table. You can also use the hot oven to prepare other foods, like garlic bread or a baked dessert. This chicken and rice oven meal was one of my standbys when my children were growing up. They have all, in turn, made it in their own kitchens.Ingredients:1 1/2 cups uncooked enriched white rice10-ounce can cream of mushroom soup1 packet onion soup mix1 3/4 cups water2 tablespoons minced fresh parsley, or 2 teaspoons dried1 chicken, cut in pieces, or 6 boneless chicken breast halves or boneless thighs, or some combination, about 1 1/2 pounds totalSprinkle of paprika1/4 teaspoon black pepperInstructions:Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. In a 9-by-13-inch glass baking dish, mix the rice, mushroom soup, dry soup mix, and water. Sprinkle fresh or dried parsley evenly over the top. Place the chicken on top of the rice and soup mixture. Sprinkle with paprika and pepper for added flavor and color.Cover the dish with aluminum foil and bake until the chicken is tender, approximately 1 hour. Remove the foil during the last 5 to 10 minutes of baking so that the chicken will brown. (If you bake uncovered for too long, the rice will dry out.)Makes approximately 6 servings.Sneaky Chef Unbelievable Chocolate Chip CookiesBy Missy Chase LapineOats and white beans make a decent chocolate chip cookie? And I want to throw in wheat germ and whole-wheat flour? Well, tasting is believing. Watch your kids devour these seemingly sinful yet incredibly nutritious cookies. I also managed to cut back on the sugar by a third, resulting in a mere 1/2 teaspoon of sugar per cookie. Then I added fiber from nutrient-packed wheat germ, whole wheat flour, oats, almonds, and white beans, all of which help to slow down the release of sugar and avoid the usual 'crash and burn' that often happens after kids eat cookies.Ingredients:1 cup Flour Blend (equal parts white flour, whole wheat flour, and wheat germ)1/2 teaspoon baking soda1/2 teaspoon salt1/4 cup rolled oats, finely ground in a food processor2 tablespoons blanched, slivered almonds, finely ground in a food processor (omit if allergic)8 tablespoons unsalted butter1/4 cup sugar1/4 cup brown sugar1 large egg1 teaspoon vanilla extract1/4 cup White Bean Puree (recipe below)1/2 cup semisweet chocolate chips1 cup chopped walnuts or dried fruit such as blueberries or raisins (optional)Instructions:Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Remove butter from refrigerator to soften.In a large bowl, whisk together Flour Blend, baking soda, salt, ground oats, and ground almonds, if using. Set aside.In the bowl of an electric mixer, beat butter and both sugars until creamy. Beat in egg, vanilla, and White Bean Puree.Add dry ingredients and mix on low speed, then stir in chocolate chips (and walnuts or dried fruit, if using).Drop rounded 1/2 teaspoons of dough, spaced 2 inches apart, onto nonstick or parchment-lined baking sheets.Bake for 12 to 14 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool on a metal rack.Store cookies in an airtight container at room temperature.Makes about 50 cookies.White Bean PureeBy Missy Chase LapineIngredients:15-ounce can white beans (great northern, navy, butter, or cannellini), or 1 cup dry beans (If you're starting with dry beans, soak for an hour, then cook according to instructions.)1 to 2 tablespoons waterInstructions:Rinse and drain the beans and put in the bowl of your food processor. Pulsing, puree the beans with 1 tablespoon of water until smooth, stopping occasionally to scrape down the sides of the bowl. The goal is a smooth, but not wet, puree. (Aim for the consistency of peanut butter.) If necessary, thin with a little more water by adding 1 teaspoon at a time until there are no flecks of whole beans visible.Makes 1 cup.The puree can be stored in the refrigerator for up to three days, or you can freeze 1/4-cup portions in sealed plastic bags or small plastic containers.Note: Double the recipe if you'd like to make extra puree to store for later use. Cocoa BatsBy Jennifer IserlohYou will need a bat-shaped cookie cutter to makes these crisp and crunchy chocolate bats  perfect for a healthy Halloween! The kids will love them because they're chocolate sugar-cookie dough, but I like them because they have whole wheat flour and are lower in fat than a traditional sugar cookie.Ingredients:3/4 cup margarine, chilled1 cup granulated sugar2 egg whites1 teaspoon vanilla extract1 1/2 cup whole wheat flour1 1/2 cup all-purpose flour1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder1 container of cookie sprinklesInstructions:Place the margarine and sugar in a large mixing bowl. Beat until combined. Mix in the egg whites and vanilla.Add the flour and mix until a soft dough begins to form.Press the dough between two 18-inch sheets of wax paper. Keeping the dough inside the two sheets of wax paper, roll out to a 1-inch thickness. Fold the sheet of dough in half (still in the wax paper) and refrigerate 1 hour until the dough starts to become firm.Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Remove the dough from the fridge, unfold, and peel off the top piece of wax paper. Roll out dough to a1/4-inch thickness. Use the cookie cutter to press out the bat shapes. Transfer them to the cookie sheets and use sprinkles to make the eyes.Bake 9 to 10 minutes until the bats are firm to the touch. Transfer to a cooling rack and let cool completely before storing in an airtight container for up to three days. These bats stay crispy even when stored!Show sources Hide sources CDC. 2011.
