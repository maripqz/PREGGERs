She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  My husband and I got married and became extremely complacent. We drank 35 times a week (heavily), and smoked a lot when we drank. The weight just kept coming but I wasnt doing anything about it other than secretly hating looking at myself in the mirror and dreading shower time. I had never been this big in my life, not even when I was pregnant! Something had to change, our children were watching   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  We had purchased INSANITY and tried it twice, failing both times. I was too fat and wasnt ready to commit 100%. Drinking and smoking were much more fun than working out and hurting myself! My husband had an epiphany Thanksgiving day when we were in California visiting family and had stayed up all night partying. I went to bed fairly late and when I woke up, he was still going at it with his brother. The family came back over for breakfast and knew exactly what had been going on and the look in their eyes was enough to shake my husband to the core about his life decisions. He started P90X that Monday. Watching him in the living room for about a month, I was ready. Popped in  INSANITY  for the third attempt and finished the program in its entirety with amazing results. Problem was, we were still drinking and smoking Well get to that later.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  Drinking and smoking were fun! It was our release time, our us time. How in the world are we going to incorporate working out, eating healthy, and Beachbody, and still be able to have fun?! And the food seriously, how was I gonna give up In N Out, Del Taco, Taco Bell, and all those other yummy, convenient places?! This was gonna be tough. My Coach, Sommer Tucker, never gave up on us! But for 3 years, werent fully, like 100% committed. Well isnt this embarrassing we lead a double life. Coaches by day, partiers by night, all the while, hiding it from our team and friends, and never receiving 100% benefits of actually being healthy because honestly, how in the  world  can you be healthy sucking down vodka and smokes?! Then one day Sommer reached out and asked us to be part of a test group It all changed from there.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  Pushing me to limits I never thought I could reach. Getting results you only see on TV or in magazines. When its real, and its happening to you, its totally different than looking at it through Facebook or any other social media avenue. These were  my  results, no one elses,  mine ! And they are  amazing !     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  Where do I start?! Over the course of the past 4+ years, as a team, my husband and I have quit smoking, quit drinking, streamlined our friends and hold those closest to us that encourage us to always be a better version of ourselves, and always move forward. At the age of 43 and 45, we are full marathon runners, certified INSANITY and  P90X  instructors, we have opened a training center where I teach INSANITY LIVE 4 nights a week, and my husband teaches OCR fundamentals and gets people ready to run races and  kill em ! Our team of Coaches is growing daily, and heres the coolest part of it all; our kids do  everything  with us. They run 1/2 marathons, spartan races, come to the training center daily, inspire their friends to do the same, and see us as the parents we were meant to be. Leaders, providers, mentors, and an inspiration in their lives. We are the family that stays and plays together! No more watching mom and dad partying on the porch. So proud that part of my life is over!   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I have inspired 100s of people to do the same! Get healthy, fit, work on their marriages, communication skills, life skills, just an all around great package. Life is amazing, and Im so incredibly happy I have the chance to see it through clear eyes. It may have taken me 3 tries to get all the way through INSANITY, and a couple of years of in and out embracing it, but Ive never been stronger in my entire life!  And  getting ready to run another full marathon next weekend in Huntington Beach!   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  She never gave up on me, and always encouraged me to push through the demons in my head. As long as I stayed out of my own way, Id be just fine! We were each others biggest fan, and still are. There arent times of weakness anymore, but when there were, wed remind each other that the outcome of sticking to the plan far outweighs the opposite! And, our kids were watching every move we made, even though they never said it. How can we expect our kids to grow up with self love when we cant even do that to ourselves! We changed   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?   Shakeology  daily for the past 4+ years is the key to our nutrition. We have since gone fully plant based diet, and the shake gives us what we need to fuel our bodies. We dont use it as a weight loss, but as a supplement to our diets, and our kids drink it daily as well!  Energize  for the boost before a workout is always  gooood ! And the recovery is amazing for those weeks where I incorporate the earlier rounds of INSANITY and really push my class! 2   Tell us about your experience with  Beachbody On Demand .

Does Breastfeeding Really Help You Lose Weight + 11 Other Myths Revealed
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/get-started/wellness/does-breastfeeding-really-help-you-lose-weight-11-other-myths-revealed,"There are a lot of assumptions made about breastfeeding. Its the best way to deliver nutrients to your baby; its the most natural way to feed your little one; it wreaks havoc on your nipples, and changes the shape of your beautiful breasts forever. Perhaps one of the biggest ones, at least for moms who cant wait to drop the baby weight and get back in shape: It burns massive calories, and is natures way of helping new moms lose weight.   Because this last notion can be so crucial to moms who might long to regain some control over their postpartum bodies rather quickly, lets dispel the myth that breastfeeding will automatically help you lose weight. Yes, it burns calories, and may help lower body mass index (see myth #1 below for more details), but you cant skip the basic weight-loss principles (and overall good health) of keeping an eye on total daily calories, moving more, and choosing quality whole foods to fulfill your nutrition needs and those of your baby.   The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that  babies be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life , and then at least partially for the next six months (since you can introduce solid foods at this point). Outside of that, though, the decision of whether or not to breastfeed, how often to do it, and when to stop are highly individualized.   Ultimately, each individual mother is uniquely qualified to decide whether breastfeeding, mixed feeding, or formula feeding is best for her individual situation, says Alison Stuebe, M.D., distinguished scholar of infant and young child feeding at the  Carolina Global Breastfeeding Institute , and associate professor of maternal fetal medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.   Were not here to tell you what choices you should and shouldnt be making. But we are here to make sure youre accurately informed. From whether or not to use formula to sore nipples to abstaining from caffeine and alcohol, there are a ton of rumors around breastfeeding. Which are true and which are myths? We had experts weigh in on 12 of the most popular ones so you can better decide whats best for you.   12 Myths About Breastfeeding: Whats the Truth?   Myth: Breastfeeding helps you lose the pregnancy weight.   Truth:  Unarguably, breastfeeding causes you to burn calories  the  American Pregnancy Association recommends consuming an extra 300500 calories  a day. A Dutch study published in the  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition  found that breastfeeding could help women  with the exception of those who weighed the most before pregnancy   eliminate weight gained during pregnancy  (about 26 pounds) after six months.   Whats more, a study in the  International Journal of Obesity  looked at nearly 750,000 women ages 50 to 64 and found that those who had breastfed their babies not only had a lower body mass index (BMI) than those who did not breastfeed, but they also  decreased their BMIs by one percent for every six months they breastfed .   But, just because breastfeeding helps you burn more calories doesnt necessarily mean you will lose weight, points out Laura Gruber, international board certified lactation consultant, registered lactation consultant, and owner of  Breastfeeding Housecalls  in San Antonio.   Breastfeeding mothers tend to feel hungrier, which means they may snack more to make up for those extra calories burned. The choice to consume healthy or unhealthy snacks, and the quantity a mother consumes is what may ultimately drive some moms  not  to lose the pregnancy weight via breastfeeding alone, Gruber says.   Youre still eating for two when you breastfeed, meaning that you pass along whatever nutrition you take in to your baby. This does not  mean  that you should eat as much of whatever foods youd like, especially if those foods arent nutrient-dense. Eat enough calories to fuel your body properly for nursing, and whatever exercise program you may be doing. If youre following a  Beachbody program , you might want to bump up to the next (higher) calorie bracket (considering that breastfeeding burns an extra 300500 calories per day).   Myth: You cant breastfeed if you have implants.   Truth:  Its safe for mothers and for babies to breastfeed if mom has implants, Alison Stuebe reassures. But if you have had plastic surgery, its important to let your doc know. Why? Your natural breasts may affect how well you produce milk.   If one breast was much smaller than the other, or if you had minimal breast tissue, you might make less milk, so its important to work closely with your babys provider to monitor early weight gain so that you and your baby get off to a good start, Stuebe adds.   If you have breast implants and plan to breastfeed, you may need to supplement to ensure your baby gets enough to eat. A review and meta-analysis of three observational studies published in the  International Breastfeeding Journal  revealed that  women with breast implants who breastfed  were less likely to feed their infants with breast milk exclusively compared to women without breast implants. Another study published in the  Annals of Plastic Surgery  also reported that many  women with breast implants needed to supplement their breastfeeding .   Myth: You must use both breasts each time you feed.   Truth:  Its a good idea to offer both, Gruber says. Sometimes babies lose vigor and stamina at the breast because they are tired, yet not necessarily full. They can become tired from sucking on a breast that isnt yielding as much as they need, she explains.   Her recommendation: Use your first breast until a baby loses vigor or stamina, since this is the most accurate way of knowing if a healthy baby is getting full. Stop and burp him or her, then always offer the second breast in case baby has made room for more [after] burping. If your baby doesnt want the second breast, thats fine. Then, you can start with the second breast at the next feed, since it will likely be fuller, she adds.   Myth: Modern formulas are almost the same as breastmilk.   Truth:  Formula makers may market their product as being almost as good as the real thing. Breastmilk is a living fluid. Formula is not, Stuebe says. To illustrate, scientists have found that  human milk contains immune and stem cells , as well as bacterial community.   A mothers milk contains bacteria that colonize her babys gut, helping to grow the babys immune system. And while some formulas have added prebiotics and probiotics, they are fundamentally different from breast milk, Stuebe explains.   Myth: Poor milk supply is caused by moms inadequate diet or stress.     Truth:  There are millions of women everywhere who have stressful lives and poor nutrition yet are still able to produce perfect amounts of milk for their babies, Gruber points out. Low milk supply is generally caused by poor breastfeeding management (such as not feeding baby frequently, or a shallow latch), hormonal issues in mom, or oral issues in baby that would cause poor milk transfer, she explains.   Myth: You cant drink alcohol while breastfeeding.   Truth:  Great news mamas  this ones a myth. It takes about two hours for a single serving of alcohol (5 oz. of wine, 12 oz. of beer, or 1.5 oz. of liquor) to clear a womans bloodstream. When it clears her bloodstream, it also clears her milk, Stuebe explains.   More alcohol does takes more time to clear out, so you may need to pump and discard milk if youve had two or three servings. Check  this handy chart  that Stuebe recommends.   Myth: Breastfeeding is supposed to hurt.   Truth:  Breastfeeding may feel new and different, but it is not supposed to hurt, Gruber says. With the exception of childbirth, pain is the bodys alert system when something is wrong, so nipples that hurt mean that something is off and can be improved. Moms who feel nipple pain, see or feel their nipples injured, or see misshapen nipples when her baby unlatches should seek help, she adds.   Myth: Breastfeeding drastically changes the shape and size of your breasts.   Truth:  For starters, its important to understand that pregnancy is what changes your body, not breastfeeding. Secondly, your breasts will change, but only temporarily. Breastfeeding can drastically change the shape and size of a womans breasts  but only during certain seasons of nursing, such as when moms milk is transitioning from colostrum to mature milk, Gruber says. Breasts normally return back to pre-pregnancy size and shape after a woman has ended her breastfeeding season.   A study published in the  Aesthetic Surgery Journal  reviewed the charts of 93 patients seeking consultation for aesthetic breast surgery, and found that  breastfeeding does not appear to have an adverse effect upon breast appearance .   Myth: Breastfeeding is just about getting the milk to your baby.   Truth:  Nurturing your baby is about so much more than nursing. Breastfeeding is about fostering a biological connection between a mother her child, and a mother can nurture her baby at breast no matter how much milk she makes, Stuebe says. Suckling a baby triggers release of the hormone oxytocin, which can encourage bonding and mothering behavior. A baby who is at breast can hear moms heartbeat, and can focus his eyes on moms face.   Even moms who dont provide 100 percent of their babys nutrition from their breasts are still able to offer them for suckling, warmth, and comfort. Being an infants food source is just one of the many hats that breasts wear when it comes to babies, Gruber adds.   Myth: Smaller breasts may not produce enough milk to feed the baby.   Truth:  Bra size isnt a reliable predictor of milk production, but some breasts do produce better than others, Stuebe says.   OK, quick biology lesson from Stuebe: An adult womans breasts are made up of both fatty tissue and milk-making glandular tissue. One woman might have small breasts that are packed with glandular tissue (great for milk production), while another has very large breasts that are mostly fatty tissue (not so great). And the shape matters, too  widely spaced or cone-shaped breasts can be associated with low milk production, Stuebe adds.   Its not easy to predict milk-making based on breast size, which is why its important that all moms and babies see a pediatric provider at three to five days after birth to check in on how breastfeeding is going, Stuebe says.   Myth: You cant get pregnant while breastfeeding.     Truth:  We dont know who started this rumor, but breastfeeding is definitely not birth control. You can absolutely get pregnant while nursing, Gruber reassures.   Frequent nursing does prevent ovulation. But, if you pump and use bottles, or your baby doesnt want to eat often, youre going a longer time between feedings at the breast than a mom who breastfeeds every couple of hours. This break can cause a mom to ovulate earlier thus sparking moms fertility even if that mom hasnt had her first period yet after childbirth, Gruber explains.   If you want to avoid pregnancy, talk to your doc about birth control options. And dont worry; Gruber assures contraception wont reduce your milk supply.   But, can contraception impact the quality of your milk? Research draws mixed conclusions; one review revealed a  negative effect on breast milk composition  in moms taking birth control, while another trial showed greater weight gain in infants whose moms had an  etonogestrel implant . An article published in  Clinical and Obstetrics and Gynecology  found that the  choice and timing of contraception   with nonhormonal methods being the preferred choice  may influence breastfeeding and infant growth patterns. The bottom line: Talk openly with your doctor to explore all of the options to find out what works best for you and your baby.   Myth: The longer you breastfeed, the healthier your baby will be in adolescence.   Truth:  This ones a bit more complicated. Theres compelling evidence that, on a population level, longer breastfeeding is linked with better health, Stuebe says.   A study analysis published in  Maternal & Child Nutrition , of which Stuebe was a part of, found that for every 597 women who optimally breastfeed,  one maternal or child death is prevented .   However, thats on a population level. For an individual mother and her child, there are many, many things that contribute to her childs health in adolescence, of which breastfeeding is just one, Stuebe adds. If breastfeeding is extraordinarily difficult for that mom and baby, the struggle to make it work may not be worth it.   The Takeaway   Whilenursing isnt the golden ticket to a pre-baby body, it does burn calories and, paired with a healthy lifestyle and thoughtful nutrition plan, can help you slim down to your pre-pregnancy weight more quickly if youre careful. Just dont be overly restrictive when it comes to calories and the quality of your calories."

21 Day Fix Results: Busy Mom Lost 124 Pounds, Won $2,000!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/21-day-fix-results-busy-mom-lost-124-pounds-won-2000,"Rachelle Hosick, age 29, lost 124 lbs with  21 Day Fix  and  Shakeology . She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $2,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  Before I started the 21 Day Fix, I had a BMI of 45 and was considered morbidly obese. I felt absolutely horrible about myself, both mentally and physically. I couldnt play with my kids, I had to sit back and watch other moms play with their kids and have fun with them. I was embarrassed to be in a bathing suit, so we rarely went to the pool. I remember one little girl asking me if I was pregnant around thanksgiving 2015. I wasnt. Thats when I knew that I needed to lose weight, but I had all the excuses as to why I couldnt. I let those excuses win until Feb 2016. My top 2 excuses included I have 2 kids, I cant go to a gym and I cant afford a gym membership. My body constantly hurt. I was taking so much ibuprofen for different pains I had. My shoulders constantly hurt. Id wake up every morning and my feet would hurt so bad I could barely walk. Id get sharp pains down my legs and I was always tired. 3   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  On 2/2/16, I stepped on the scale and saw 296.  I weighed almost 300 lbs!  I walked straight to the kitchen and dumped an unopened 2 liter of Mountain Dew down the drain. I havent had soda since. I decided that enough was enough, I knew what I had to do to lose weight and get healthy for me and my family. So I started eating healthy and walking 30 minutes a day. I was so bored and found myself slipping back to my old ways. Thats when I found the 21 Day Fix in March 2016. I didnt want my kids to have a big mom that couldnt play with them. I didnt want my husband to have a unhealthful wife; I wanted him to be proud of his wife and to want to show me off (even though he still treated me like a queen at that size and loved me anyways). I wanted to be healthy and to be able to wear cute clothes! I was done with my excuses. My kids deserved better, my husband deserved better, and most importantly I deserved better than what I was doing to my body.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  My biggest challenge was my own excuses. Beachbody and the 21 Day Fix answered those excuses and made them excuses no more! 21 Day Fix is amazing. Its just one 30 minute workout a day, and I can do it in my own home! I love the 21 Day Fix because it tells you exactly what/how much you can eat, how much water to drink, and which workout to do everyday!   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I love the simplicity of it. I love that someone who has no idea about losing weight can do it. I love that there is an app to help track progress. I love the workouts; they kick my butt. Even though I still have some room to improve, the muscle that I have gained while doing the  21 Day Fix  is amazing!  I have muscle!  Im also starting to see the ab line down the middle and sides of my stomach from all those ab workouts.     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I have noticeable muscles! ( Yay! ) I am so proud of myself for losing so much weight and being healthy! Im proud of myself for working out everyday, no excuses. Im proud of myself for eating healthy. I proud to be getting even more healthy and toned. My energy is up, I dont have pains all over my body anymore (and if I have pains, its because Autumn kicked my booty and my body is trying to recover). I can get around easily and play with my kids. When I started with 21 Day Fix, I did everything modified. When I did a forearm plank, my stomach touched the ground. I can do almost everything unmodified now and my stomach doesnt even come close to touching the ground when I do the forearm plank. Thats another thing I love, you can still see results when doing the modifiers. Even the modifiers are hard, no one should ever feel ashamed for doing the modifier, you will eventually be strong enough to do the workouts unmodified.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  The 21 Day Fix is an everyday thing for me; its my lifestyle now. Make healthy food choices, drink my  Shakeology  daily, drink my water, and work out. Since doing the 21 Day Fix, I feel so much better. I can climb a flight of stairs without being tired. I can fit in a regular size arm chair and not have to be afraid my weight is going to break it. I genuinely feel good about the way I look. I dont have to be ashamed, I can be proud of what Ive done and so can my husband and kids. I also love the energy Im getting from Shakeology! I feel like it really does help with any junk food cravings and I feel like Im sleeping much better/deeper at night. *Bonus*: Shakeology is so good, I feel like Im indulging in an ice cream shake or something. Who needs those bad-for-you energy drinks when you can have something so good for you for about the same price? 2   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  Im a part of a great group of women. All the ladies are always posting encouraging things on there that make you want to better yourself and keep going. The group just keeps you accountable for what your doing and it also gives you other people to interact with who are on the same journey as you.   Tell us about your experience with Beachbody On Demand. If applicable, how has it helped you achieve your goals?  I love that  Beachbody On Demand  gives you access to so many free programs!

Beachbody Results: Amanda Lost 71.6 Pounds and Won $1,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-amanda-lost-71-6-pounds-see-her-results,"Amanda Reece, age 35, lost 71.6 lbs. with a variety of  Beachbody fitness programs  and  Shakeology . She shared her results with the  Beachbody Challenge  contest, and won $1,500!     Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I am a mom of twobeautiful children, ages eightand two, and gained about 6065 pounds with each one. After I had my son eightyears ago, I was able to lose the baby weight relatively quickly by dieting and running, but then slowly began to gain some back before I got pregnant with my daughter. After having her twoyears ago, I just couldnt drop the weight. Between working full-time, balancing sports activities with my son, having a newborn, and just daily life, I had let myself go. I was making poor food choices, exercise was nowhere in my vocabulary, I had no energy, and just hated the way I looked. Outside of the day that I delivered my children, I weighed the most I had ever weighed in my life. I didnt want to get on the scale in fear of the reality of what it said, and I lived in leggings and dresses because I just didnt want to face the fact of buying the size I needed. I had zero confidence, never wanted to be in pictures, and just felt terrible about myself   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  My kids and my husband. After multiple failed attempts to lose weight, I had given up. In January of 2016, I had come to the reality that this was just how my life was going to be, and I needed to accept that. I cleaned my closet out and actually started buying clothes that fit even though I was  not happy . Finally in March, I said Enough is enough get yourself together and make a change! Diabetes runs in my family, and what kind of example was I setting for my children?! I need my health for myself and for my family. We had booked a couples cruise for August, and I was determined to make a change before this trip. At the time, I really knew nothing about Beachbody but I had heard about the  21 Day Fix  program, and a friend recommended a Coach. Then, I made the call to my Coach the call that truly has changed my life in so many ways.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  The biggest challenge for me was  food . I love to eat.I like big portions and all things that are bad for me, and I stress eat. I would constantly overeat, and had just formed really bad habits like cookies in the afternoon and wine before bed. When I started 21 Day Fix in March, all of that changed. I found myself meal prepping, measuring my food, packing healthy snacks, and cutting out the alcohol. My old/bad habits faded away. I was committed to making a change in my life, and the structure around the program and the support of my Challenge Group helped keep me on track. What I loved most was that it became easy for me no counting calories, no counting points, and I was able to eat  real  food. The combination of Shakeology and eating every 23 hours helped to keep me full throughout the day and helped to prevent overeating. 2   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I chose 21 Day Fix because it seemed manageable for me. I did not have a lot of time, and I was not someone who particularly liked to exercise (okay, I was really lazy and made every excuse under the sun to avoid doing it). I knew that if the program was too intense or took up a lot of my time, I would simply not stick with it So the fact that the workouts were only 30 minutes per day and it was recommended for a beginner made the program appealing to me.     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I started seeing results immediately, which I needed, and on average lost about 1012 pounds per month. I did 21 Day Fix for fivemonths straight, then one round of  21 Day Fix EXTREME , oneround of  Country Heat , 3 Week Yoga Retreat, and threeweeks of  22 Minute Hard Corps  before starting  CORE DE FORCE  on November 7th. Within sixmonths of starting Beachbody, I lost 70 pounds and reached my goal weight! From March 21, 2016 toNovember 6, 2016, I have lost a total of over 70 pounds and 53 inches. I have gone from a size 14 to a 4. I have energy, confidence, and I love how I am inspiring others to begin their own journey to a healthy lifestyle and to reach their goals. I am so very proud of all of those things I feel amazing!   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  My life has changed in so many ways. I now have energy to keep up with my kidsandlook forward to working out every day.Eating healthy is now the norm (I still meal prep, plan, and use my portion-control containers). I love shopping for new clothes (and feel good wearing them).I now feel good about myself and know that I am so much healthier than Ive ever been in my life! Its my new way of life; for me this is a new lifestyle, a journey, and I dont see a stopping point.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  Being in a Challenge Group helped hold me accountable. I knew that I had to post what I ate at the end of every day and that I had to post my results on Monday. It made me think twice about making bad choices, and forced me to stay on track over the weekend since I knew the weigh-in was on Monday. I also loved the fact that everyone was on the same journey;they were supportive and there for me if I had questions. Its a fun place to be and Ive made so many new friends along the way!   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  Heather has been there cheering me on from Day 1. She believed in me and motivated me to always keep pushing. When I look at her story and see the success that shes had because of Beachbody, its truly been an inspiration for me.   How did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/regularity?  Im a 365er (well, in March I will be!). I never miss a day of  Shakeology , and Ive done the  3-Day Refresh  several times and had great results. Shakeology has helped reduce my cravings, gives me more energy, and keeps me fuller longer throughout the day. I look forward to my shake every morning for breakfast! 2   Tell us about your experience with  Beachbody On Demand . If applicable, how has it helped you achieve your goals?  I work full-time and travel about once a month for work, so I take BOD with me wherever I go!

Transformation Tuesday: Angela Lost 20 Pounds With 21 Day Fix
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/uncategorized/21-day-fix-results,"Before starting  21 Day Fix , Angela struggled with working out and had horrible eating habits. After completing the program, she lost 20 pounds and is now an expert on portion control! Here is what she had to say about her journey.   Before the 21 Day Fix, I had tried other programs but to no avail. I was disappointed in myself. Being pregnant with my third child really did damage to my body, and instead of going forward, I was going backwards. So, I finally decided to try the program and work out. By the second week, I started to see results! Seeing improvements at such an early stage in the program pushed me to continue.   The workouts were easy to follow and were different every day. Autumn is awesome! She articulates clearly and motivates you. I felt as if she was in my living room, physically training with me. The meal plan was easy to follow as well, and the containers were a big plus for someone like me. I had no clue whatsoever about portion control or what fruits were best for me. The 21 Day Fix meal plan laid it all out and was simple to follow.   Im in love with my results! My body shrunk completely, mostly in my mid-section. I no longer have to worry about tucking in my stomach and I am now comfortable in my clothing. I get tons of reactions from friends and family. Some even think I got surgery! Its so hard for them to believe that I was able to get into shape in such little time. I just laugh about it and tell them to follow my 21 Day Fix journey on Facebook.   I am glad I did not give up, and Im proud of myself for completing the program!     You can change your life, too.

Trying to Save Money? Don’t Skip Your Workouts
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/trying-to-save-money-dont-skip-your-workouts,"If youre trying to save money, you know that sometimes you have to get a little creative to cut your monthly bills. Limitingyour latte habit is one way to tighten your budget, and you might even consider cancelling your current exercise plan.   But according to a recent study published in the  Journal of the American Heart Association , you might want to think twice before cutting back on your workouts in an attempt to save some dough.  Not exercising could end up costing you a lot of money in the long run .   Researchers analyzed the 2012 results from the annual Medical Expenditure Panel Survey that surveyed 38,974 men and women to see if there was a connection between inactivity and spend on health care. For the purposes of this study, researchers excluded the data from individuals younger than 18 as well as those who were underweight, pregnant, or able to walk up fewer than 10 steps.   They then sorted the data of the remaining 26,239 individuals into two groups: those answered yes to the survey question do you currently spend half hour or more in moderate to vigorous physical activity, at least five times a week? and those who answered no.   In this study, moderate and vigorous physical activity were defined as thus:  Moderate physical activity causes only light sweating or a slight or moderate increase in breathing or heart rate and would include activities such as fast walking, raking leaves, mowing the lawn, or heavy cleaning. Vigorous physical activity causes heavy sweating or large increases in breathing or heart rate and would include activities such as running, race walking, lap swimming, aerobic classes, or fast bicycling.      Individuals were also classified based on their level of cardiovascular disease (CVD) or cardiovascular modifiable risk factor (CRF). Those with three or more CRFs were profiled as poor and those with two were profiled average. Those with one or no risk factors were profiled as optimal.   Even after adjusting for covariates (demographics, insurance type, socioeconomic status, etc.) the researchers found that the largest average difference in how much someone spent each year on health costs was between those who had CVD and nonoptimal physical activity levels and those with optimal CRF and optimal physical activity levels.   Those with CVD and non-optimal physical activity levels  spent an adjusted average of $9,419 more every year  ($12,659 vs. $3,240). The average adjusted difference in spending between who had CVD and optimal physical activity levels and those who had CVD and nonoptimal physical activity levels was $2,500. (You might have seen that number flying around the interwebs.)     The study also noticed a significant cost savings between individuals who had optimal CRF and optimal levels of physical activity and those who werent as physically active. The savings there? $493.   Since this was an associational study, it cant confirm that regular exercise causes someone to spend less on health care, it only shows that the two are linked. Still, the numbers suggest that adding regular physical activity to your routine should pay off.   For overall cardiovascular health, the American Heart Association  recommends  at least 30 minutes of moderate-intensity aerobic activity at least 5 days per week for a total of 150 minutes or at least 25 minutes of vigorous aerobic activity at least 3 days per week for a total of 75 minutes; or a combination of moderate- and vigorous-intensity aerobic activity. For additional health benefits they suggest adding moderate- to high-intensity muscle-strengthening activity at least 2 days per week.

Is Wild Rice the Healthiest Type of Rice?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/is-wild-rice-the-healthiest-type-of-rice,"Get ready to have your mind go  poof . Even though everyone and their mom thinks that brown rice is the best rice for your body, theres another option out there thats worth a taste.   Say hello to wild rice. Technically, this dark, nutty grain is actually a type of grass. But if it looks like rice, and it cooks like rice, then hey! No big thing.   Heres what makes it so awesome, plus how to get your fill.   What Is the Healthiest Type of Rice?   Lets picture wild, brown, and white rice sitting on a (delicious) spectrum. On the healthier end of the spectrum sits wild rice: Compared to the others, the grass is lower in calories, and delivers more protein to help you stay fuller longer, says registered dietitian Alex Caspero. It also packs a whopping  30 times more antioxidants than the white variety .   White rice is at the other end of the spectrum. Because its been stripped of its nutrient-rich outer hull, it has the least amount of fiber, protein, vitamins, minerals, and antioxidants. Nutritionally speaking, its pretty similar to white pasta, Caspero says.   Brown rice is somewhere in the middle. Though if you had to give a precise location, it would probably sit closer to wild rice than to white. Its still a  good source of fiber , and it offers up most of the same vitamins and minerals found in wild rice.   If youre a numbers person, heres how it all breaks down (per one cup cooked):     Wild rice :  121 calories, 6.5 g protein, 3 g fiber   Brown rice :  218 calories, 4.5 g protein, 3.5 g fiber   White rice :  205 calories, 4 g protein, .5 g fiber        Should You Avoid Other Types of Rice?   Wild rice has a lot to offer, so its definitely worth adding to your diet. Use it in grain salads or pilafs, for stuffing Portobello mushroom caps or winter squash, or in soups. You could even try grinding uncooked wild rice and using it as a crunchy, gluten-free coating for fish, suggests the Whole Grains Council.   Thats not to say that you need to bid farewell to brown rice, though. Its like comparing apples to blueberries, Caspero says. Blueberries contain more antioxidants, but both are healthy options. It doesnt mean that apples arent still a great choice.   So instead of thinking about dinner (or breakfast, or lunch) solely in terms of which grain is healthiest, balance the nutritional stuff with your personal preferences. So many foods are healthy choices. Dont stress about choosing the healthiest one all the time, Caspero says.   Its even fine for white rice to have an occasional spot in your rotation. Just balance things out by pairing it with nutrient-dense foods. Just as theres a difference between pasta marinara and pasta alfredo, theres a difference between white rice with vegetables in a light sauce and white rice with butter, says Caspero. Psst  if you really do want fettuccine alfredo,  heres a healthy one .   Doesnt Rice Contain Arsenic?   Of course, no food is perfect  not even wild rice. Like brown and white rice, tests show that  wild rice absorbs small amounts of arsenic  that occur naturally in the soil and water.   The FDA has long monitored arsenic levels in rice, and recently proposed safety limits on rice-based products, such as infant rice cereal, for babies and young children. They also recommend that pregnant women eat a variety of foods and whole grains to offset the potential risks of arsenic in rice (though  theres no official limit  for how much rice pregnant women should eat).   But adults who eat a well-rounded diet arent at risk, and according to the FDA,  consumers dont need to worry about changing their rice consumption . But if youre concerned, here are two ways to reduce your exposure:     Cook your rice like pasta.  Findings show that cooking rice in a large amount of boiling water (six to 10 parts water to one part rice) and draining it  can reduce the amount of arsenic in your rice by up to 60 percent .   Mix things up.  Enjoy rice a few times a week, but round things out with other whole grains, too, such as quinoa, buckwheat, or millet."

Beachbody Results: Mother of Four Loses 45 Lbs, Wins $1,000!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-mother-of-four-loses-45-lbs-wins-1000,"Jennifer Hagen, age 40, lost 45 lbs with  21 Day Fix ,  21 Day Fix EXTREME ,  The Masters Hammer and Chisel , and the  Beachbody Performance  supplements. She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I started 21 Day Fix when my 4th baby was only 7 weeks old. 4  I was 45 pounds overweight, feeling depressed, and had even scheduled a doctors appointment for two weeks out to hopefully get put on anti-depressants. I had no energy, and most days I had to will myself to get out of bed. I couldnt stand how I looked in the mirror to the point that I turned my full length mirror in the bathroom around, so when I walked past it, I didnt have to see myself. When I started the 21 Day Fix, I had to modify what Cat the modifier was doing, because I had no core strength. I was so badly out of shape.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  After my very first workout, I noticed an improvement in my overall mood. I actually felt a glimpse of happiness. Every time I pushed play, I would notice a surge of happiness, and my mind would feel less foggy and depressed. Within the first week, I would find myself pushing play twice a day, just to feel the positive increase in my mood. I ended up cancelling my doctors appointment for help with my feelings of sadness. As my mood improved, so did my body I was able to loose 7 lbs and 13 1/2 inches my first 21 days.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  The greatest challenge I had before starting the  21 Day Fix  was actually sticking with any one program. I have always yo-yod with my diet and weight. I have tried every diet pill, fad-diet, gimmick, and fad. I have struggled with my weight my entire life. Its always been really hard for me to get under 165 pounds. I even weighed that when I was in high school. This is the first time in my life that I have been able to get below 165 without diet pills. I am 145. I am in the best shape of my life at age 39 and after having 4 children. I am disciplined to my daily workouts now, and I no longer crave sugar. I have completed 21 Day Fix,  21 Day Fix EXTREME , and now two rounds of Hammer and Chisel, and am currently doing 22 Minuet Hard Corps. I became a Beachbody Coach in September 2015, and am pursing my NASM certification so I can continue extend my reach with my business. Beachbody has changed my life, physically, mentally, and financially!   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I liked that the program was easy to follow and only required 30 min a day from me. I had just had my 4th baby, and had my hands full with a newborn, a 3-year-old, a 10-year-old, and a 19-year-old. Once I felt comfortable and strong with 21 Day Fix, I advanced to 21 Day Fix EXTREME. I saw amazing results by incorporating plyos with 21 Day Fix EXTREME. I very quickly moved onto  The Masters Hammer and Chisel . I loved the variety of workouts in H&C and the strength training with Sagi got me motivated to do Body Beast. I am now doing  22 Minute Hard Corps  daily for my HIIT cardio hybrid with  Body Beast  weight training.     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  Since May 2015, I have been able to lose 45 pounds and over 50 total inches from my body. The mental and emotional results far outweigh my physical transformation as well. I was feeling really low when I first started my program, I have now completed 4 programs, hybrid 2 at a time now, and feel great!   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  Since completing my program, I have become a Beachbody Coach. I was able to leave my full time job away from the home and stay home with my children now. I have more strength and confidence than I did when I was 20 years old. I am turning 40 this year, and I am in the best shape of my life.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  Participating in Cristy Owens Challenge Groups helped me stay accountable and gave me the inspiration by watching others be successful. I completed 7 challenges with my Coach before I started running my own challenges. Cristy taught me the tools that I need to successfully create and run my own Challenge Groups on Facebook. I now run a monthly 21 Day challenge.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  My Coach, Cristy Owens, not only supported me and encouraged me on my journey, she taught and mentored me on how to become a successful Beachbody Coach as well. She has never missed a day checking in with me and continuing her support. She has pushed me when I felt like giving up and always believed in me. She is not only my Beachbody Coach, she has become my friend and my mentor!   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained?

Is Sushi Healthy?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/is-sushi-healthy,"The long and short: It depends. Sushi can be a nutrient-dense, power-packed meal thats high in protein. But, if youre not careful, it can be a significant source of unhealthy fats, sodium, and calories.   I mean, we get it. Sushi can seem like a healthy go-to; its fish, rice, and seaweed, right? True. But, like many other cuisines, the traditional version is subject to Western culinary interpretation. Soy sauce too plain? Amp it up with some sugar-spiked brown glaze. Raw fish unappetizing? Coat it with breading and drop it in the deep-fryer. Roe too strange to top a roll with? Add texture with deep-fried panko flakes.   Of course, sushi comes in all shapes and sizes and can vary greatly from restaurant to restaurant. Energy-wise, were talking 150600+ calories per roll, and thats without the brown glazes, cream cheese, or mayonnaise-laden fillings. A basic spicy tuna roll, for instance, is made with tuna, rice, seaweed, sriracha, and mayo and weighs in at about 290 calories.   Also, lets keep it real: Who eats just  one  roll of sushi for dinner?! Thats like ordering a small salad with dressing on the side, and then gobbling half of your dates fries.   To keep sushi from becoming a diet buster, follow these tips when ordering your next roll:   Go brown.  Ask for your sushi to be made with brown instead of white rice. Brown rice is higher in fiber (to keep you regular) and  lower on the glycemic index , meaning it wont spike your blood sugar as much as the white stuff. According to Chef Bobby Calabrese from the new cooking show  FIXATE , starring  21 Day Fix  celebrity trainer Autumn Calabrese, Many people use brown rice as a substitute, which is good, but we took it a step further and designed a  quinoa-based sushi roll  that is a perfect match for [Beachbodys] nutritional goals.   One roll of sushi can contain up to  1 cup of rice , which adds about 160 calories and 37 grams of carbohydrates. Again, we feel you on the more-than-one-roll thing. We know you dont have the appetite of a toddler. Keep reading for our portion control tip.   Skip the sauce.  Spicy mayo, eel sauce, soy sauce, oh my. The fat, sugar, and salt adds up when sushi is topped with condiments. Youre almost heading into cheeseburger territory if you get all the saucy, creamy, crunchy bells and whistles. To keep it light, go easy on the sauces and opt for ginger and wasabi. Dip  dont dunk  your roll or nigiri in lower-sodium soy sauce (the one with the green top) to slash some sodium.   Eat protein.  Many fishes can be excellent sources of protein, but to get the biggest bang for your buck, choose  omega-3 rich fish  like salmon, tuna, mackerel, and eel. These fatty fishes are among the  few sources of vitamin D  in the diet. If youre squeamish (or pregnant), stay away from raw and choose steamed or grilled sushi over fried (aka tempura) options.   Control portions.  Keep portions in check by ordering one roll, and add a healthy appetizer or two to satisfy your appetite. A roll of sushi contains about six pieces of fish, ranging from 25100 calories per bite! If youre still hungry after one roll, add some ginger or seaweed salad, edamame, or miso soup. Some sashimi  simple slices of raw fish  can also help fill the belly.   Opt for healthy fats.  Fats help to keep you full, but not all are created equal. Choose sushi rolls with  avocado , and skip the ones with cream cheese, mayo, eel sauce, and those fried in oil. We know these can be the temptresses of the sushi bar, but once you get used to eating less gussied up Japanese fare, those wacky rolls will start to look like celebrities who wear too much makeup.   Up the veg.  To get more filling vegetables in, order a veggie sushi roll (theyre usually lower calorie, too). Traditional veggie sushi is filled with cucumber, carrots, and avocado. Please your palate with extra pizzazz from rolls, called  futomaki , made with pickled vegetables.   So yes, sushi can be healthy  if  youre savvy about how you order."

She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,500!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I had successfully lost weight with  21 Day Fix  and felt stronger after completing both the fix and  PiYo . I felt good but I didnt feel like I had much muscle tone and I couldnt do a pull-up to save my life. I mean, I wouldnt be a very good apocalypse buddy if I cant even pull myself up, right?! My lack of upper body strength has really limited me in life. After I had my son, I could hardly hold him. My shoulder wasnt supposed to hold anything over 10 lbs and my son was born at 9 lbs 11oz! 4  It was a really tough struggle for me. We wanted more children and I just couldnt see my weak body making it through another pregnancy. I was so sad during and after pregnancy. I felt so helpless to my circumstances, like a victim. After that experience, I never wanted to feel that way about myself again. I felt tired and much older than I should have at that point in my life.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I wanted to be healthy for my family! I wanted to be able to crawl around with my son and keep up with him during play time. I needed to have more energy and couldnt stand being stagnant anymore. I had a fairly active lifestyle, and was a full-time bedside nurse, pre-baby but I didnt know how to eat right, so as soon as my activity dropped due to a rough pregnancy, I gained a ton of weight and really started losing the will to live. Thats not the dream I had in mind when I was a kid. Grow up, get pregnant, grow stagnant, suffer through depression, then die that picture was not what I wanted to see for myself! I saw that future and that path ahead of me and it scared me. I decided to stop that. I looked to my friends and family that were living positive, healthy life that I wanted. I watched them and started rebuilding relationships. That was pre-beachbody; as soon as Beachbody showed up for me, I was hooked. It was everything I needed to start and succeed!   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  I was stuck at a plateau. 160 was definitely a lot less than I started with but my body wasnt  nearly close  to where I wanted it to be. I had weak muscles, a busted left shoulder, and damaged right knee. 3  My 30 pound 2-year-old was starting to get too heavy for me to lift comfortably, so I knew I needed to build some muscle and get my core in better shape. I also hadnt done much high-impact yet and my body was not too tolerant of any high-impact workouts which is awful because running is a hobby of mine! Thanks to the conditioning from Hammer and Chisel, I can jump the bench now! I can do the plyo jumps! I can hold a plank and tap! I can even do  pull-ups!  Thats huge! Beachbody overall helped me with my diet challenge! I literally hadnt ever learned how to eat correctly, even through nursing school, it wouldnt stick. I needed to grow and be honest with myself. I learned this all with the portion control system and the advice Ive received from team Beachbody! It has been a phenomenal journey.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I loved the calendar. The set up kept me interested and busy! I never felt like I hadnt done enough after a Hammer and Chisel workout, and their quotes are hilarious! I enjoyed the motivation and inspiration that Sagi and Autumn provided. I learned a lot about myself during the second round of this program. I had already been through it once, so I knew the moves and had the muscle memory, I really liked how hard it helped me push myself. My favorite part about the program is how instructive the trainers are on form. Ive been hurt by personal trainers, yet never during my workouts with Beachbody and Im pushing harder and lifting heavier than I ever have. This is the way to go!     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I reached my goal weight, Im below my pre-pregnancy weight now, and I (our whole household) am overall entirely healthier than I was prior to starting the program! I lost a noticeable amount of weight and inches. I am so very proud of completing this program, start to finish. I achieved so many measurable results but the most important of them is how accomplished I feel. Being able to do pull-ups has always been a goal of mine but I never knew how to work up to the, until this program, and now I can do pull-ups for a full minute! I am proud of the jumps I can do now, how  strong  my body is. My very last day, very last move, I was able to pull a 30 lb dumbbell over my head! That was unthinkable a minute before I did it. I couldnt do that with a 5 lb weight when I started, it caused too much pain. I can do clockwork pushups! I remember falling out of that the first day and wondering how I would ever make it, I am most proud of the mindset shift I attained during this program.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I cant even begin to tell you. My entire life is completely different than it was prior to Beachbody. I know that sounds cheesy but this literally saved me! I was a wreck. I needed something to hold on to, I needed someone to tell me to get off my butt, get in gear, and lose the crap excuses for not doing what I needed to do to be happy and healthy! I am forever grateful and just want to pay all the good feelings forward. I am a registered nurse and Ive never helped people be well. I helped sick people get better; helped them mask greater issues with medications or surgeries. Now I get to help people grow from the inside out. They blossom from sadness or worthlessness into life-loving people with their programs and personal development. My family life has changed. I feel gratitude rather than negativity. Everyone in my house is healthier and happier now! Thank you for helping me making this all possible.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  Participating in and running challenge groups really helped me stay accountable because I felt like I needed to hit those workouts early to keep my challengers motivated. I also didnt want to disappoint them or myself, so it helped me a lot. We share recipes and tips, too, for staying focused to hit our goals   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  Caitlynn has been absolutely  wonderful ! The Coach that personally sponsored me originally, quit recently and hadnt been a leader to us at all. So I was really just doing my own thing. Caitlynn invited me into her Challenge Group, creates motivating videos for us, and recognizes us for success. Shes awesome!   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?   Shakeology  has done wonders for me! It lifted my mommy-fog! I have energy like I have never had before!  Recover  has helped maintain my muscle growth and repair, and I noticed significant decrease in soreness when I take it.  Hydrate  completely eliminated my leg pain. It wasnt soreness but a deep pain I would feel, like electrolyte imbalances. Hydrate solved that problem for me and it tastes great.  Energize  is the only pre-workout I can drink. I usually get really jittery and feel like Im going to pass out with pre-workout supplements so I stopped drinking them. I tried energize in a packet and  I am in love . It gives me energy to dive into my workout and push for that extra rep without making me feel chest pain and a racing heart! The  performance  products have been a huge win. I used a  3-Day Refresh  between rounds, I feel like that set me up for great results my second round. My body felt clean and light after that. All these products and programs support each other well.   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

What is Cupping Therapy?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/get-started/wellness/what-is-cupping-therapy,"If youve watched any of the captivating performances in Rio this past week, you might have found yourself feeling slightly concerned for some of the athletes. From swimmers to gymnasts, the backs of many competitors were decorated with large red circles.   No, there isnt some weird disease going around. Those splotchy dots are intentional. It comes from an old Chinese medicine method called cupping, a form of myofascial release. Its different from massage or foam rolling in that instead of pressing and compressing, its decompressing and creating space, explains acupuncturist Janet Lee, L.Ac., DACM. Cupping has been around for thousands of years and has become noticeably popular among athletes, even though the science behind the practice is the subject of some debate.      How Does Cupping Therapy Work?   There are a few different cupping methods, one of which involves pricking the skin to draw blood (this is known as wet cupping), but one of the most common techniques uses glass cups. Lee explains that a cotton ball soaked in alcohol is placed inside the glass cup and lit on fire. This removes the air and creates a vacuum. The cotton ball is then removed, and the cup is placed directly on the skin, where it lifts up the skin. This creates space between the skin and the fascia (the connective tissue encasing muscles), and is said to help boost blood flow and relieve muscle tension.   When you have an injury there will be bleeding and edema (fluid that causes swelling) in the area, Lee says. According to Lee, The dark color on the skin is from the cupping lifting out some of that stagnant blood, cellular debris, and lymph that never cleared. In most cases, the cupping marks are just lightly red from superficial capillaries being broken, which is not dangerous or even painful.      Does Cupping Therapy Work?   Although Olympic gold medalists swear by this ancient technique, not everyone is convinced that that it actually helps improve athletic performance. A 2012 review looked at 135 randomized controlled trials and found that the scientific evidence doesnt support the efficacy of cupping for anything beyond shingles, acne, facial paralysis, and cervical spondylosis. Another review from 2011, which looked at fewer studies, came to the conclusion that cupping may be effective for reducing some pain conditions and shingles, but adds that there are still doubts that remain about this conclusion, and more testing should be done.      Is Cupping Therapy Safe?   Despite the need for more research, Lee says that most people who enjoy a massage can benefit from cupping, and she compares the sensation to getting a deep tissue or sports massage. Although cupping might not be extremely painful, there are some cautions you should take with this practice. Sometimes you can get blisters, and a common thing with the glass cups is the edge can get hot and burn the skin, Lee says. You dont want to do cupping when you have a fever or cold, if you have bleeding issues, and if youre pregnant, you shouldnt do it around your abdomen or back.   If youre interesting in trying this kind of myofascial release, Lee says to be sure to go to a licensed practitioner. Just like with a massage, you want to go to someone who knows what they are doing."

Beachbody Results: Brittany Lost 32 Pounds with CIZE and PiYo!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-brittany-lost-32-pounds-with-cize-and-piyo,"Results vary depending on starting point, goals, and effort.   Brittany Preston, age 28, lost 32 lbs with  CIZE  and  PiYo . She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I had just had my second baby, and although I didnt gain as much weight as I did during my first pregnancy, I certainly felt like I had. I was uncomfortable in my skin, and my confidence was in the gutter.    What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I had lost all of the baby weight after having my first child, so after having my second, I wanted to get back there  so  badly. Hating the reflection staring back you in the mirror is an awful feeling. As do most new moms, I just wanted my body back! So I ordered CIZE to ease back into working out. I did a few rounds of that, and finished up with PiYo, which I  love .   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  Eating healthy and finding time to workout. There were any times I pushed play and had both of my sons crawling around on the floor with me during PiYo. My toddler even joined in on the dancing with CIZE, which was fun for both of us! The nutrition guide was an amazing help for me. It offered lots of variety, and good food. Not crappy diet food.  Shakeology  was great for me as well. I love the way it makes me feel. Beachbody has truly changed my life!     What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I loved CIZE because its so much  fun . I got a great workout, while dancing and having a good timewhat more can you ask for? I love PiYo because its low impact, but still offers a killer workout. I was sore in places I didnt know I had muscle! The workouts are doable. They are relatively short, and as a mommy of two under the age of two, that was key for me!   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  Im so proud of reaching my goal of losing my baby weight and fitting into my pants againthey are actually big on me! My body is more toned than it has been, perhaps ever.

Beachbody Results: Amber Lost 43 Pounds and Won $1,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-amber-lost-46-pounds-and-won-1500,"Amber Brockwell, age 33, lost 43 lbs with  21 Day Fix  and  CIZE . She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge,  and won $1,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  Oops, I did it again! Where do I begin? 3 years ago, I was ready to find myself again. I was extremely overweight, and I almost lost my then 9-year-old son to respiratory arrest from a life threatening asthma attack. As I saw him lying in the hospital bed in a coma on a ventilator, I knew it was time to take charge of my life so I could be the best role model I could possibly be. Fast forward a few weeks after we got home, and I was fortunate to run across a package of Chalean DVDs. It had everything I needed to get started.  Turbo Jam ,  ChaLEAN Extreme , and  Turbo Fire . So I gave it a shot and thought, Well maybe Ill lose a few pounds. When it was all said and done, I ending up losing over 80 pounds. Let me give you a little background on my life. I have the most amazing son that was born in 2004. My husband and I tried for over 10 years to give him a sibling, and have another child. We never had any luck. When I had given up all hope, I ended up pregnant. And I 100% believe that it was due to the fact that I had taken control of my life. My small frame was no longer supporting all of the excess weight, and I no longer had high blood pressure. I was elated to  finally  be pregnant again. We were blessed with a beautiful daughter in August of 2014. Due to sleepless nights, and caring for this beautiful bundle of joy, I stopped focusing on myself. But guess what happens when you stop leading a healthy lifestyle with proper nutrition and exercise? Thats right, you gain weight. And that I did. I gained every bit of it back. It is now time to focus on myself again. And I had  no doubt  on where I needed to turn to get my life back. I went immediately to Beachbody. I truly believe in them, and their products. I knew they helped me before, and they could help me take control of my life again. I knew I had to focus on portion control (which was out of hand for me), and I had to start a great workout again, one that I would look forward to doing. This time I turned to 21 Day Fix and CIZE. And let me tell you that I wholeheartedly know that I made the right decision. Within my first round, my energy  sky rocketed  and I lost many, many inches. With trainers like Shaun T and Autumn, I know they have my back. As odd as that may seem, although they are in my TV screen, I feel they are friends of mine. And they truly care about helping others and it is their passion and their gift they give to others. Thank you Beachbody for helping me gain my health back for a second time!   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  3 years ago I watched my little boy fight for his life. He was on a ventilator in a coma due to respiratory arrest from an extremely severe asthma attack. I vowed to be the best role model for him. That is when I first decided to take my life back. After putting all of my weight back on from my last pregnancy, and knowing that I now have a daughter to look up to me, I without a doubt have to set a positive example for her. I want her to grow up and always love herself and her body and to always be confident.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  The greatest challenge for myself was realizing that it is okay to put myself first. It is okay to focus on my health and wellness. I have to take care of me in order to take care of my family. I have to be able to pour from a full cup. I cant pour from an empty cup. The Beachbody team, trainers, and programs all taught me that.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I dont even know where to begin. I love everything about it! 21 Day Fix got my nutrition to be on point, which I definitely needed help with. I would binge eat in front of the TV for hours, not paying attention to what I was putting in my body one bit. It taught me that healthy foods can be delicious, and if they are perfectly proportioned you never feel hungry. It is a no brainier when it comes to portion control. I love working out with Autumn. I trusted the process and her, and thought of her as a friend. She really pushes you and makes you feel strong. Plus I connected with her knowing she is a mom. I also loved the rotation of the workouts every day, because my body never became used to it. It was constantly changing.     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I can now look at myself in the mirror now and love who is looking back at me. Before I couldnt even look at myself in the mirror because I was disgusted with what I had done to myself. I had no one to blame except me. I can now say I love myself again and I no longer have to hide. I can now walk into a room and hold my head high. I have found myself again. I am now leading by example to my kids, which is most important. Overall my blood pressure has decreased, which is wonderful! It decreased my overall fat percentages, and took a great amount of weight off of my small frame. I was shocked to see just how fast the pounds started to fall off! The health benefits will pay off in the long run. I do not get easily winded, and I have so much more energy!   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I no longer turn the other way when I see someone in a store that I know. I dont have to be embarrassed with the way I look. I am confident in myself again. I can chase my young daughter and my son again without getting winded. I am active, energetic and happy again. I never wanted my daughter or my son to grow up listening to me complain about my body, and put myself down. I want them to have a confident mom so they can grow up and always be confident and love themselves. That is especially so important to a young girl.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  Yes! Yes! Yes! Challenge Groups are simply incredible. It is a community of people that support and encourage each other. You are surrounded by people that are in the same boat as yourself, and you all genuinely want to see each other succeed. The groups keep you accountable, and you make lifelong friends who share the same passion.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?   I cant say enough kind words about my Coach. She is simply one strong and beautiful woman inside and out. I actually first connected with her through Facebook and followed her for a while. She has a passion for what she does and I look up to her. She knows how to lift you up and make you believe in yourself. I knew that she was meant to be the coach for me. She is an incredible person.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  Mmmm,  Shakeology . It is unbelievable. It always gives me a great pick me up and tastes wonderful! I never had to guess on what I needed to put into my body. There are so many ways you can prepare it and change it up. My body can tell when I skip a day. When I do, my energy levels drop dramatically, I feel sluggish, and my appetite is harder to control. It also helps my digestive issues by drinking it. My son loves it too! In the beginning it tasted so good I almost felt like I was cheating. I had to keep reminding myself that it is healthy! I recommend it to everyone. Between the shakes and the programs, I found myself with less stress, wonderful peaceful sleep at night, and my blood pressure has improved. 3   Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program? (e.g. Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, triglycerides, etc)  I used to have problems sleeping at night, and now I sleep like a baby! My joints are no longer sore.   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed! Complete any Beachbody program, and enter your results for a free gift and a chance to win cash and prizes.

Beachbody Results: Erin Lost 85 Pounds and Won $1,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-erin-lost-85-pounds-and-won-1000,"Erin Baehr, age 50, lost 85 lbs with  21 Day Fix ,  21 Day Fix EXTREME , and  The Masters Hammer and Chisel . She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,500!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I have struggled with weight issues and body image since my teen years (Im 49). After a bout in college with anorexia and bulimia, I found a healthy balance in eating and fitness when pregnant with my oldest son. I maintained that balance until about 12 years ago. After losing my only brother to suicide in 2004, I turned to food to cope and numb the feelings of grief and my weight began to creep up. My unhealthy coping skills continued as I dealt with the stress of starting a financial planning and tax business, supporting my husband through Cancer, and caring for my daughter who was bedridden on-and-off for 6 years with a chronic illness. I often joked that the first 5 cookies didnt help, but I was sure the next 5 would. As my weight ballooned, my confidence plummeted. I was self conscious and missed out on many opportunities because I was too embarrassed to be seen. I felt weighed down, both physically and emotionally.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  Over the years, I tried so many times to diet and lose the weight. Most of the time I couldnt even get going, but the times I did I was quickly derailed by the new crisis of the week. I finally resigned myself that this is who I was now. In the beginning of 2015, some things happened to convince me to give it one more try. My doctor got my long standing sleep issues under control, giving me more energy than I had in years. A friend saw a picture of me and my grandson from two years past and asked who that was, because he didnt recognize me. I was so embarrassed. I watched another friend (a Beachbody Coach) as she shared her weight loss journey. I knew her life was super busy, and was intrigued by how she managed it. My sons August wedding was quickly approaching as well. Staring down another stressful year, I knew I had a choice to make. I could continue down the same road and gain even more weight, or I could do something different and lose it instead.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  After eating whatever I wanted whenever I wanted for so many years, I had lost all perspective on what normal eating was. I knew that a diet was not going to work for me, that if this was going to be successful it had to be a lifestyle change. I decided that would come only by eating like I did when I was thin- but the question remained, how? My friend shared with me that her success came from the 21 Day Fix and how it fit right into real life. When my containers arrived and I read the plan, I knew she was right. The containers helped me to relearn portion sizes and an appropriate amount of food to eat in a day. I couldnt believe how little cheese was allowed; I had been eating about a dozen times that before starting the plan! It was simple to understand and put into practice, both at home and when eating out. I was not hungry a bit, and knew this was a lifestyle I could keep. Not once did I feel like I couldnt wait to be done so I could go back to eating like before.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I loved the containers with the 21 Day Fix as I mentioned, but I also appreciated that the workouts were only 30 minutes long. I started in February, in the height of my busy tax season at work but still was able to find that 30 minutes every day. Autumn is encouraging and motivating, and I hear her voice in my head even when Im not doing the workouts (nobody quits! you can do anything for 60 seconds! be better than you were yesterday!). I loved that I could see changes in my body so quickly; it helped motivate me to keep it going. Having a plan for what workout to do each day was invaluable, and I enjoyed seeing my progress in the workouts as they cycled back around again the following week. After several months of the 21 Day Fix, I felt comfortable with heavy weights and no modifications, so I moved up to 21 Day Fix EXTREME in October. My muscle growth and weight loss exploded with that program. The progress was incredible and I love how Autumn pushes even more in EXTREME.     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  When I started my journey, I wore an XX-L and likely was in a size 20. I refused to buy new clothes and I was wearing two pairs of very seriously stretched out size 16 pants. I have lost 85 pounds and 66 inches and am in a size 4! More than that, I am happy to be strong and healthy. A year ago I could barely get up the stairs at home without being short of breath and pains in my knees and feet. Now I bound up those stairs! At 50 lbs lost in October, I wanted to run a lap just to see if I could. Ive been running regularly since, now over 20 miles a week . The friend who didnt recognize me in the picture challenged me to run 3 miles in under 30 minutes, and on January 2, we went to the track and I did it! Im proudest though that for the first time in my life I have a healthy relationship with food. I found better ways to handle stress, I express my feelings instead of numbing them, and reward myself with positive things for my health rather than food.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  If you said to me a year ago that i would own running shoes, workout clothes, a treadmill, or dumbbells I would have thought you were crazy! But here I am, working out just about every day and loving it. On the eating side of things, I see food as fuel now, and make choices in what I eat based on how it will make my body feel, not what will satisfy my sugar cravings. I can look at a piece of cake and willingly without regret pass on it, or even have a piece if I want it- but it doesnt set me off on a junk food binge anymore. Im healthy, energetic, and happy. I no longer dread getting dressed in the morning because of how my clothes fit, because they all look great! My increased confidence has been great for me professionally too; I am more outgoing and dont want to hide. My daughter is eating better and exercising too, which has improved her illness as well. The positive change in me is apparent to my family and friends, and more than once Ive even been told Im glowing.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  I knew for quite some time that my weight was a health and quality of life issue, but had a hard time getting motivated to stick with a plan for more than a few days, or get started at all. Being in the group gave me the structure I needed to start, and the encouragement of the group helped me continue. I knew each day we would be facing the same challenges and doing the same workouts, and that the group would be looking for me to report in. I didnt want to disappoint my fellow challengers!   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  Ive known my Coach Meg Watt for a number of years, and when she started her weight loss journey I watched with interest. I knew she had an incredibly busy life, and if the plan fit into her life, it could fit into mine. She encouraged me that the plan was workable with real life, and invited me to join the group. She helped me figure out 21 Day Fix and checked in with me periodically to see my progress. Meg was ever encouraging and cheered me on.   You can change your life, too.

Ultimate Reset Results: This New Mom Got Back in Shape in 21 Days!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/ultimate-reset-results-this-new-mom-got-back-in-shape-in-21-days,"Nina Millan, age 32, lost 20 lbs in 21 days with  Ultimate Reset . She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  Life before the reset was very difficult for me. I recently had a baby, and the pregnancy was very hard on me. 4  I had gestational diabetes and hypertension. I delivered safely, but a few months after birth I started gaining weight rapidly, despite attempting to eat healthy and trying to commit to regular exercise. As a new mom I felt tired, sluggish, and like I was existing in a fog. My thoughts werent clear, I looked like I had aged, my hair was thinning, my skin looked blotchy, and I had regular breakouts. Exercising was very difficult, and I suffered from digestive pain and cramping on a regular basis. Also, my cravings for sugar were at an all time high. And since I had GD while pregnant I was now at risk for developing diabetes later on in my life. I really felt that now after having 2 kids, I would never have the body I always wanted.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  In the last few years I lost my best friend to diabetes, my mother to RA, and my grandmother. But having struggles again after giving birth, something clicked. I realized that I couldnt keep living with this hurt and weight. This was such a happy time in my life finally after so much loss. The prospect of starting a new family renewed my faith in life and the fact that I knew I would be needed now more than ever before. I wanted to be a positive role model for my children and feel like I could be at my best for them. I like to think of myself as a second time success story with Beachbody. Beachbody has never failed me! I believe in the programs and products and its proof that if you commit to yourself and to the plan you will succeed. But this time I wanted to be in better shape and better health than before. The Ultimate Reset was going to allow me to be my best self yet, and I believed now that I was starting a new life, it was time to achieve a new level of optimal health.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  Food addiction. Food has always been my struggle; it has always been a war where I would advance, and retreat. It always seemed like two steps forward and ten steps back, when I was off my game. I knew that I would not reach my goal if I didnt deal with the demon that was my food issue. So the first thing I did was read the program guide from front to back. I needed to enforce the foundation of what good health was in my mind. So the next thing I did was throw out all my old take out containers that reminded me of bad choices, and I replaced them with new clean containers in portioned controlled sizes. This allowed me to prep all my foods for the week, and take my lunch everyday. The Reset made me organized with my eating overnight! I went to the farmers market before my first day, and was amazed at how much food I could buy for three people.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I loved the meals!  Wow , so easy and fresh. I also loved how I felt each week. I noticed that after the first week I was sleeping better and more sound. I noticed how alert I felt at work. When everyone wanted snacks like chocolate or cookies, I had my greens (my favorite by the way!) and was totally fine. There was no guesswork with the Reset. Since everything was on a schedule, all you needed to do was to follow it. I also loved how budget friendly everything was. I was able to feed my family of 4 for the duration of the Reset on $200! Before the reset we would spend $200 a week on groceries. My wallet was very happy!      Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I was amazed with my results! My sleep improved, my cravings are gone, my skin looks amazing, and I dont feel hungry all the time. The biggest shift has been in my mood. I dont feel anxious or scatter brained at times. And I am visibly slimmer, and fit into clothes I havent worn since 2014! I gained back a few dress sizes, and 3 belt loops, now that my waist is smaller. I am most proud of the fact that I got organized and stuck with it! That has been the hardest thing for me. My family feels better now that our meals are more organized and prepared. And I know that I am making my daughter proud of me when shes sees how happy and vibrant I have become over the last 3 weeks. The cloud of sadness and loss has faded and made way for a more confidant, healthy me, from the inside out.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  Well, for the first time in years, I now pack my lunch every day. Its automatic for me now, and I dont event want to spend money on lunch knowing I might be caught out there waiting for Mr. Food Addiction. There is no temptation to make bad choices. I fit in my old clothes again, and I have been feeling amazing every day since I finished the Reset. My family has grown stronger now that we are all more active in planning our meals together. My daughter enjoys flipping through the meal plan, and coming up with ways to spice up the existing recipes in a healthy way. And I am showing my son new foods to try. Doing this will impact them for the rest of their lives. I am most proud of that. And for the first time since having a baby, I feel like I will achieve the fitness I have always wanted because I am working on my biggest problem, food addiction.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  Challenge Groups are an amazing way to stay connected to the core purpose of  why  you want to make an active change. My Challenge Group started with a few women who were all like me, addicted to food. The most fun thing about them was sharing the recipes and posting pictures of the food, also how our refrigerator looked before and after getting organized. Challenge Groups are a must have to be accountable and successful!   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?   My Coach is not active, but I have other team members that cheered me on. Honestly the Coach that helped me the most is my husband Neftali Millan. He was my rock, helping to prepare meals, giving me encouragement and doing the Reset with me. He was hands down the reason why I had such success.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  The supplements were awesome. They gave me energy and clearly they worked! I really love the taste of the greens, reminded me of eating spinach which is one of my favorites!   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?  The biggest change was my eating issue. It may not be a clinical diagnosis, but it was a huge battle and one that was destroying my life partly due to sadness over my losses. I know that I will always have to watch out for temptation, but the Reset has made it easier to cope and feel prepared. My cravings are gone for bad foods and I now crave healthy foods more than ever!   Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program? (e.g. Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, triglycerides, etc)  I will find this info out when I go back to my doctor later this month. But I know how I feel and how my body responded. My body fat dropped, and I m not concerned about getting diabetes anymore.   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Results vary depending on starting point, goals, and effort.   4 Always consult with your physician before commencing any fitness program or nutritional product if you are pregnant or postpartum."

Healthier Fettuccine Alfredo
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/healthier-fettuccine-alfredo,"Pasta is a dish that tugs at your heartstrings. My mouth waters thinking about a steaming plate of hot pasta  and lets not forget about the freshly grated Parmesan cheese that melts on top. One of my favorite types of pasta is fettuccine alfredo. I love how the creamy garlicky sauce coats each noodle. Its the type of dish you never get tired of, and its always a crowd pleaser at the dinner table.   According to lore, this dish was created by Alfredo Di Lelio in 1914 as an attempt to please his pregnant, nauseated wife. The original version was made with butter and Parmesan cheese, not cream, and this tradition continues outside of the U.S. When Di Lelio and his family moved to New York, he opened a restaurant, bringing this dish to the states.   Whether the sauce is made with butter and cheese or butter, cheese  and  cream, its not exactly the  lightest  option out there. We figured there had to be a way to get that no-compromise flavor without all the cream and butter. And Im happy to report: We did it! This recipe features a healthier version of fettuccine alfredo. No cream, no butter, but all the flavor.     The secret? Cauliflower!   To make this dish, you start off by cooking your pasta. We opt for a whole-grain fettuccine for added fiber. Once the noodles are cooked, youll want to reserve some of the pasta water for the sauce. If you dont normally add pasta water, its a great trick to use when making pasta sauce. As the noodles cook, theyll release starch into the water. By keeping and using some of the leftover water for the sauce, you can thicken it without the need for added oil or flour.   Next, youll prepare the fettuccine sauce. Start by cooking the cauliflower in vegetable broth (for extra flavor). While it cooks, lightly saut garlic and olive oil together. Once the cauliflower is cooked, add it to the blender alongside the garlic, nutmeg and reserved cooking water. A quick trip to the blender will turn the cauliflower into a silky white sauce. Add the sauce back to the pan, stir in some unsweetened almond milk, and just like that you have a healthier fettuccine sauce thats full of flavor. Youd never guess theres cauliflower inside, but it always feels good sneaking in extra vegetables. Garnish with Parmesan cheese and chopped parsley, if desired.       Healthier Fettuccine Alfredo   Total Time:  40 min.   Prep Time:  15 min.   Cooking Time:  25 min.   Yield:  4 servings   Ingredients:  8 oz. dry whole grain fettuccine  3 cups low-sodium organic vegetable broth  1 medium cauliflower, chopped (about 1 pounds)  2 tsp. olive oil  2 cloves garlic, finely chopped  1 pinch ground nutmeg  Sea salt (or Himalayan salt) and ground black pepper (to taste; optional)   cup unsweetened almond milk   cup shredded Parmesan cheese  2 Tbsp. chopped flat-leaf parsley (for garnish; optional)   Preparation:  1. Cook fettuccine according to directions on package. Before draining, reserve 2 cups of cooking water; set aside.  2. Bring broth to a boil in medium saucepan over medium-high heat. Add cauliflower. Reduce heat; cook, covered, for 12 to 15 minutes, or until soft.  3. While cauliflower cooks, heat oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.  4. Add garlic; cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute, or until garlic is soft. Remove from heat and strain.  5. Place cauliflower in blender (or food processor) with 2 cups of reserved cooking water, garlic, and nutmeg. Season with salt and pepper if desired. Blend in two or more batches if necessary; cover with lid and kitchen towel. Blend until very smooth. Add additional cooking water if needed.  6. Heat cauliflower mixture in same medium saucepan over medium-low heat.  7. Add almond milk; cook, stirring frequently, 5 to 7 minutes. Consistency should be that of a thick soup.  8. Add fettuccine; mix well.  9. Divide fettuccine evenly between four bowls. Top evenly with cheese and parsley (if desired); serve immediately.

Beachbody Results: Mom of Two Lost 59 Pounds and Won $1,000!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-mom-of-two-lost-59-pounds-and-won-1000,"Samantha Carroll, age 24, lost 59 lbs with  21 Day Fix ,  INSANITY MAX:30 ,  P90X3 , and  Shakeology . She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I had just given birth to my second son six weeks before starting the 21 Day Fix program. This was my second baby in two years! I used my pregnancies as an excuse to eat anything and  everything  I wanted. I sat around for nine months straight with my second pregnancy munching on junk food and soda. With the first I was working a very physically demanding job up until eight months but still eating  a lot  of bad things! After having my 2nd son, it was incredibly hard for me to look at my body in the mirror. I lost over 20 lbs after delivery and was left with all the excess weight from my junk food eating. It was  not  pretty! Im only 23 years old and I found myself daydreaming about my pre-pregnancy body. Tall, lean, and 140 lbs! Would I ever see that body again? I am so young, will I be stuck like this forever? While I was and still am overjoyed to be a mother to two beautiful baby boys, I was depressed with what I let happen to my once beautiful body. It was much more than a few stretch marks.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  My  wonderful  Coach Maura Kivlin inspired me to begin this journey. She was a former co-worker of mine at a local nursing home. Being her friend on Facebook, I had seen her transformation and I couldnt help but be inspired. She gave birth around the same time as I did with my first son, and she was in phenomenal shape! I had to know how she did it. So I contacted her while still pregnant with my second son and told her I would be joining as soon as I was finished with the pregnancy! She added me to her Facebook accountability group, Team Reformers, at the start of my program and the outpouring of inspiration and motivation within that group is truly amazing. I owe all of my success to everyone in that group for keeping me focused and motivated on what I and everyone there was looking to accomplish. They are wonderful people!   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  My greatest challenge was the simple fact that, I never stick with anything. Ill try something for a few days, maybe and week, and decide its too hard, too time consuming or some other excuse and quit. That was not the case with the 21 Day Fix. For the first time in my life, I stuck with a program and finished it! Once again, my Coachs accountability group was the key to me sticking with this and staying motivated! I knew I had people counting on me and expecting results! Not to mention, the eating plan for the program is wonderful. Never did I go hungry or feel deprived. Ive learned so much about nutrition and clean eating and I get super excited to find recipes that are not only good for you but taste phenomenal! Why should healthy have to taste bad? Fast forward over a one year after my first round of the 21 Day Fix and Im in the best shape of my life after six rounds of 21DF, two rounds of INSANITY:Max:30, and Im on my last month of P90X3 now!   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  The meal plan was a pleasant surprise for me. I was happy to see how many different options I had and how much I could have of each container. It really inspired me to hunt down great recipes to get the best out of each container group and incorporate them all into endless meal possibilities!     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  Ive lost over 50 lbs and a whole lot of inches. However, just as much as I love how my body is changing, I am super proud of the sheer fact that I finished these programs from start to finish and Im still at it over a year later! This is a first for me and it has really boosted my self esteem.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I have so much more confidence, I am happier, I have more energy to play with my kids and I  feel  better. I never realized how my eating habits were making me feel like a slug; tired, depressed, lazy and so on. I now feel like I can take on the world these days!   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  All of the support from my friends in the group made it so much easier to feel proud of the hard work I was putting in! It truly kept me accountable knowing I had a responsibility as part of the group to do what I was supposed to be doing. Workout  everyday , follow the meal plan, and engage with the rest of the group!   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  Maura Kivlin is simply wonderful! She is so inspirational and really takes the time to pay personal attention to all her Reformers! She is a wonderful Beachbody Coach and I would absolutely recommend her as a Coach to anyone looking to start a Beachbody program!   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?   Shakeology  has been a game changer for me! I wasnt able to start using it until a few months ago. I was stuck at a plateau for  months  on the scale. My body was changing but the scale stopped moving. The scale has finally started moving again and I know its because of Shakeology. It tastes great and I feel great knowing that Im putting  amazing  super-foods into my body  every  single day!   You can change your life, too.

Whats 5 stone, you ask? 70 pounds! After her pregnancy, she wanted something to help her lose the baby weight, and she found INSANITY, and had some amazing results! Remember, always consult with your physician before commencing any fitness program or nutritional product if you are pregnant or post-partum. Heres Christies story in her own words.   I heard about INSANITY on TV,looked more into it, and thought Id give it a go. I wanted to lose weight that I put on after having my daughter, and the INSANITY workouts looked great. I wanted to lose my baby weight and tone up. I was in poor shape as I couldnt do extreme workouts during my pregnancy, but now Im in the best shape Ive ever been in.   The first week of the program, the workouts were so intense and my body was not used to that, especially after having a baby. As I progressed, I could see the difference in my body after two weeks . I was so shocked and it made me want to do more. Ive tried other workouts, and they got boring, but INSANITY keeps you guessing what will be next.   Shaun T is by far one of the best instructors Ive had on a workout DVD. Hes there with you every step of the way, and without him pushing me, I wouldnt have gotten through the first day. He pushes himself in the workouts, so you know its not just for the TV  he pushes you. I love these workouts because they push you to your limits that you never knew you could cross. I feel amazing, fitter, healthier, and energetic . I can do so much more with my daughter. I can now wear fitted clothes without thinking I look awful. My friends and family were amazed at how much my body has changed looking backonthe first photo .   From doing INSANITY, I lost 5 stone (70 lbs!) and 16 inches off my waist, which I never thought I could do. INSANITY changed my lifestyle completely. I have so much more confidence in myself now than before, I have an endless amount of energy so I can do anything with my daughter without feeling tired. I am so happy I pushed play, because if I didnt, I would be unhappy with how I looked. I love INSANITY. The workouts are like an addiction; once you start them, you dont want to stop. I will always use INSANITY and Shaun T workouts now as I am my own living proof that you get results . If you put in the effort, youll see a change in 60 days.     You can change your life, too.

This Busy Mom Lost 59 Pounds and Four Dress Sizes!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/this-busy-mom-lost-59-pounds-and-four-dress-sizes,"Jasmin Watkins lost 59 lbs. with  FOCUS T25  and  Ultimate Reset . She entered her results into the  Beachbody Challenge , and won $1,500!    Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?   Prior to my journey, I was repulsed by my body. I had just given birth to twin sons, and while I loved being a mother, I hated the fact that I still looked pregnant months later. Nothing fit, and I was depressed. I wouldnt go shopping, and I avoided mirrors at all costs. I didnt even want to take pictures, because I was so embarrassed about my body, especially my stomach. I have a condition called diastasis recti, and was told the only way to lose the stomach fat was to get cosmetic surgery. That made me even more depressed. People would always tell me how fat I had gotten, and it hurt me so deeply. To think an experience that was supposed to be so positive made me feel so unattractive and disgusted. I was jealous of all of my friends, and I never wanted to be seen in public. I just wanted to hide.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I had lost weight right before Igot pregnant with my twins, and I knew I could do it. I was tired of being jealous of all of my friends. I was tired of wondering whether my husband could possibly be attracted to me knowing that I was about 90 pounds heavier than when we met. I wanted to be in shape. I wanted to be able to play with my twin sons, and run after them without running out of breath. I just wanted to be a better me. I wanted better health, but I also wanted to look good in my clothes. My confidence was almost nonexistent. One day, a coworker came up to me and told me in front of everyone that I let myself go. At first, I was embarrassed, then enraged, and then motivated. Deep down inside I knew she was right. I no longer could blame the twins for my look nine months later. I was inspired to try something different.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  The greatest challenge I faced was finding the time to work out with two newborn sons. I was breastfeeding at the time, and they were also very needy. I also had a nine-year-old daughter in fourth grade that needed assistance. In addition, I was juggling being a wife and a full-time teacher. I also coached dance. It seemed almost impossible at times. With T25 only being 25 minutes, it was perfect for me. Its easy to find 25 minutes during their naptime. Sometimes when the music would come on, they would start to dance. Indirectly, I felt as though they were cheering me on. I felt a new sense of motivation. Nutrition was also a challenge as well. Its hard to cook healthy meals for yourself while cooking other tasty meals for everyone else. I followed the meal guide and used recipes posted in my Challenge Group, which helped me to overcome my challenges. Not to mention, the meals were so tasty, the entire family loved them;it made the process so much easier.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I loved that there was a modifier, because I struggle with jumping. I used to tell people that running and jumping were against my religious beliefs. I hated it that much. The modifier allowed me to keep up, yet I was still drenched in sweat by the time I was done. I loved the moves as well, because it felt like dancing sometimes. What I love most about the program is Shaun T. I love his spirit and positive energy. I love how he is so charismatic. I love how he encourages you, and for a minute, you truly feel as though you are not alone. I truly felt that Shaun T really cared about the people watching the video. He wanted us to be and do our best. He motivated me through a television screen better than trainers at the gym were doing and for a lot less money.   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I lost four dress sizes and 59 pounds with  FOCUS T25 . I feel incredible. I feel lighter; Im sleeping and breathing better;I am not as tired;my energy has skyrocketed; and Im overall just a happier person. Prior to T25, I never thought I could complete an exercise program. I hated exercise. I only liked exercise if it was dance-related. If there wasnt dancing, I wanted nothing to do with it. When I tried T25, I never thought I would actually finish it. The achievements that I am most proud of are finishing the program twice andthat my results have inspired others. That makes me so proud, because its something that I never thought I could do.     How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  Since completing the program, the biggest change Ive made is my attitude. I dont approach things with an attitude of doubt. I am always positive and always smiling. If a situation seems unattainable, I think of ways to conquer it. I dont have a defeatist attitude anymore. I dont sit down, cry, and drown myself in ice cream and chicken wings. If someone makes me mad, I work out and take my aggression out on the workout. I also dont feel powerless. I realize that I have more control over life than I would like to admit. Its easy to sit and complain about being overweight, but do nothing about it. Since Beachbody, I realize that I will only be as fat as I allow myself to be. If I dont like being fat, I have the power to change that with help. I truly feel like there is nothing I cant accomplish thanks to FOCUS T25 and Beachbody. I am so grateful for everything.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  Checking in daily encouraged me to work out, even when I didnt want to. There were so many nights, being a mom of three, that it would be 10 PM and I still hadntworked out. Normally, I would simply make an excuse, but the challengers and my Coach wouldnt allow it. I often did things out of a sense of loyalty to the other challengers. I never wanted to let anyone down, and I knew that we were all in the struggle together. If I messed up with a food choice, I felt encouraged, not defeated. I was also often given healthy alternatives to the unhealthy food I loved, which made healthy nutrition more appealing to me. When I didnt want to work out, my Challenge Group partners encouraged me to work out. They held me accountable. I also tried to inspire others while in this process, and that made me more motivated, because I had to practice what I was preaching. We became a mini-sisterhood.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  My Coach is amazing. She posts motivational quotes, recipes, sayings, pictures, and things that made usjust want to continue to press play. She empowered us, and didnt allow usto make ourselvesfeel helpless. She is very transparent, and allowedusinto her personal journey. She was very vocal about her challenges and struggles, and that helped usto see that this is a difficult journey for everyone. No one is born with a six-pack. She allows usto see her hard work and be inspired by her strength, resilience, and tenacity. She would check in with people when they became quiet. It was never about the commission for Crystal. She truly was invested in everyones journey. She knew our whys, and reminded us of them when we needed to hear them to keep going. She supported us through our struggles, and pushed us to be better with each passing day.   How  did  a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your  transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/ regularity ?   Shakeology  was perfect for me. I often skipped meals, and as a result, my metabolism was so slow. I hated breakfast, because I found healthy breakfast to be so boring. For me, I would love bacon and Belgian waffles every day.If I couldnt have that, I didnt want to eat breakfast. Shakeology allowed me to eat on- the-go, and provided me with energy. It allowed me to not skip breakfast, and I never felt slighted because it was so delicious. I felt as though I was cheating with a chocolate milkshake, and my cravings disappeared. I also did the  Ultimate Reset , and I found the entire experience to be life-changing. It helped me to be more aware of food triggers. I had to acknowledge all of the emotional eating that I was doing rather than eating to live. It also made me feel as though I was purging both physically and mentally. When I was done, my mind was clear, I was breathing and sleeping better, and I just felt better overall. I had a renewed appreciation for life.   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Should Women Take Creatine?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/performance-sports-science/should-women-take-creatine,"Lets put one fear to rest right away: Taking creatine wont give you a barrel chest, saddle you with sleeve-busting arms, or otherwise bestow you with unflattering man muscle. Nothing can (except steroids), and you can thank (or blame) genetics for that. On this point, the research is clear: If youre a woman, supplementing with creatine wont turn you into a linebacker.   Otherwise, creatine is an equal-opportunity workout enhancer. Many studies show that ladies can experience the same performance improvements as men  including increases in strength and endurance  without a significant increase in body weight. In one landmark  study  from Canada, for example, men and women who supplemented with creatine for six weeks both became stronger, but only the guys bulked up. The difference could be due to the fact that men have more muscle to begin with, says Joan Eckerson, Ph.D., a creatine researcher and professor of exercise science at Creighton University, in Nebraska. Theres also evidence that creatine may effect the breakdown of leucine  a key muscle-building amino acid  differently in women than it does in men. But the reality is that scientists havent found concrete explanation for the gender difference, says Eckerson. Indeed, the difference has baffled scientists for decades, since creatine serves the same primary role in the body regardless of whether your chromosomes match or not.   Creatine helps create energy. Whenever the body runs low on its primary energy source, adenosine triphosphate (ATP), creatine reacts with other molecules to generate more. As a result, creatine helps the body not only sustain muscular work, but also recover between bouts of it. If you recover faster between sets, you can keep lifting longer and harder, leading to greater gains in strength and power, says Eckerson. This benefit extends post-workout, reducing the time needed between intense lifting sessions. Theres also evidence that it helps endurance athletes recover between repeated bouts of exercise [like intervals], says Eckerson, although its not shown to significantly effect endurance exercise performance.   If you do notice greater muscle growth while taking creatine, odds are it wont be significant. In one recent  study  from Brazil, for example, women in their 60s who took 5 grams of creatine a day during a 12-week strength program gained just 3 percent more muscle than those who took a placebo. What was significant, however, was creatines effect on training volume: By the end of the study, the women who took creatine were able to handle more than double exercise volume (i.e., total sets and reps) of the placebo group. So while creatine cant help you look like a bodybuilder, it might help you lift like one.   Which brings us to another misconception: The idea that creatine is a steroid. Its not. Creatine is a protein manufactured by your kidneys, liver, and pancreas, and ingested by way of meat, poultry, and fish. Your body makes about one gram [per day], and you get another gram [per day] from food if youre an omnivore, says Eckerson. Vegetarians and vegans miss out on that second gram, but that doesnt put them at any real disadvantage; if you work out, and you want to boost strength and performance, you should consider increasing your daily dose to more thantwo grams with a supplement like  Beachbody Performance Creatine .   This is where many women throw up their hands. With so many versions of creatine available to consumers  including creatine nitrate, gluconate, malate, ethyl ester, magnesium chelate, hydrochloride, and alpha ketoglutarate to name a few  deciding between them can easilybecome overwhelming. So allow us to narrow your choices: Dismiss anything thats not labeled creatine monohydrate. Its the most studied (and generally the least expensive) form of creatine, and nothing else has been proven more effective, says Eckerson.   You can also dismiss any instructions regarding loading, which is the practice of taking extra-high doses for several days to saturate your muscles. Studies show that even a single daily dose of 5 to 10 grams can do the trick. To optimize your results, take 2 to 5 grams (most scoops are 5 grams) of creatine monohydrate 30 to 60 minutes before exercise, and then again within 30 minutes of completing your workout. If this isnt doable, just take the entire 5 to 10 grams post-workout. Anabolic hormones, including insulin and growth hormone, are elevated after exercise, helping to drive more creatine into your cells, says Eckerson, who recommends blending it into a shake or stirring it into juice to make it more palatable. An additional 2 to 5 grams first thing in the morning on rest days will make sure your creatine tank remains topped off.   Need another reason to give creatine a try? Taking it may benefit your bones, according to Canadian researchers. In their  study , postmenopausal women who added creatine to their training routine for one year lost 69 percent less bone than those who took a placebo. The reason: Creatine may activate bone-synthesizing cells called osteoblasts, say the researchers.   As with any supplement, consult your doctor before taking creatine  especially if youre pregnant or have kidney problems. Your body breaks creatine down into a waste product called creatinine, which is processed in your kidneys and excreted in urine, says Eckerson. Thats not a big challenge if your kidneys are healthy, but it can be if they arent."

The Lie Energy Drinks Are Selling You
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/performance-sports-science/can-b-vitamins-really-boost-your-energy,"B-vitamin infused energy drinks are an excellent example of what happens when retail companies dont let science get in the way of making a quick buck (or, in this case, billion). Heres the grain of truth that sparked all of the B-vitamin hype: Many of them  including folate (B9), B6, and B12, which are found in scores of energy drinks  help enzymes within our cells turn nutrients from food into energy we can use. So, naturally, that means that taking a mega-dose of them should translate into more energy, right? Wrong. Your blood stream can only accommodate so much  once youve met the recommended daily value of B vitamins you pee out most of the rest, says Ralph Green, M.D., Ph.D., a distinguished professor emeritus of pathology and laboratory medicine at UC Davis who has researched B vitamins. Sure, some are stored in your body  your liver contains a limited supply of B12, for example. But those stores wont contribute to an immediate surge of energy because theyre not immediately available, says Green. Not that thats even an issue  chances are, you have plenty of Bs in your system already.   Recent  CDC data  shows that only 11 percent of Americans are deficient in B6, only 2 percent are lacking in B12, and just 1 percent are low in folate. The reason: Most people get plenty of all three from their diets. Whole grains are rich in B vitamins, and many products made with refined grains, such as cereals, are fortified with Bs. Plus, theyre present in many fruits and vegetables  bananas and avocados are rich in B6, while spinach and asparagus are packed with folate. Of course, there are exceptions to the rule  people with certain forms of anemia and gastritis are often deficient in B12, and thus may benefit from supplementation. Vegetarians and vegans are also more likely to fall short on B12, which is only found in meat, poultry, fish, dairy, and eggs, says Green, adding that such a deficiency can sap your production of red blood cells, causing anemia and general fatigue. Also, if youre on a low calorie diet, you might not be hitting the right numbers for Bs, but thats nothing a good multivitamin cant fix.   Most adults 19 to 50 need 1.3 milligrams (mg) of B6 per day, while women and men 51 need 1.5 mg and 1.7 mg, respectively, according to  National Institutes of Health dietary guidelines . You need 2.4 micrograms (mcg) of B12 and 400 mcg of folate. (In all three cases, pregnant and lactating women need more.) Its also possible to consume too much of some B vitamins. Regularly consuming more than 100 mg of B6 per day  which is easy to do if you take an energy shot on top of a multi-vitamin  has been linked to nerve damage, for example. NIH guidelines also suggest that consuming excess folate  more than 1,000 mcg per day for adults  can increase your risk of developing colorectal cancer.   Research specific to energy drinks hasnt done much to advance the rep of B vitamins as energy boosters, either. Thats because the B vitamins in these products arent tested independently of other potential energizers, such as taurine and choline, not to mention the only proven energizer, caffeine. That makes it hard to figure out exactly what is responsible for any energy boost you might experience. For instance, in a recent  study  at the University of the Pacific, people who took a caffeinated 5-Hour Energy shot reported a three-hour energy boost, while those taking a decaffeinated version experienced a one-hour spike. Whats not clear is why the decaf version had any effect at all. Was it the taurine, the choline, or something else altogether? Its very possible that its a placebo effect, says study author Sachin Shah, PharmD, an associate professor of pharmacy practice at the University of the Pacific. People might have reported an energy boost because they expected one.   If you want to perk up, one of your best bets is still caffeine. Not only does it stimulate your central nervous system, enhancing motivation and energy, but it can also boost strength and reduce your perception of pain, according to a  study  in  The Journal of Sports Medicine and Physical Fitness . Caffeine has a pretty good track record of increasing performance, especially aerobic or cardiovascular performance, says Mike T. Nelson, Ph.D., C.S.C.S., a fitness trainer and consultant near Minneapolis.   Caffeine is particularly effective at boosting performance during morning workouts, according to a recent  study  published in the  Journal of Science in Medicine and Sport . People who consumed caffeine before a morning training session exhibited greater contraction velocity (i.e., explosive power) than they did when they consumed it before an afternoon workout. The reason: Your ability to recruit your largest muscle fibers is depressed in the first few hours after waking, and a central nervous system stimulant (like caffeine) can help jump start your mind-muscle connection, say the researchers.   Regardless of when you work out, Nelson recommends consuming up to 200 milligrams of caffeine about a half hour before exercising. A cup of coffee or a serving of  Beachbody Performance Energize  which contains 100 mg of caffeine and, for the record, no B-vitamins  will do the trick."

Everyday Products are More Toxic Than You Think
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/get-started/everyday-products-are-more-toxic-than-you-think,"You probably have some inkling that the chemicals in plastics, pesticides, cleaning solutions, and other everyday products are bad for youbut just how bad are they? Can they really cause tumors, obesity, birth defects, and developmental disorders as many watchdog organizations attest? The fact that these toxins, known as endocrine-disrupting chemicals (EDCs), are everywhere is nightmarish enough. But nothing sells papers like a bad dream, so every few years the media picks up on a particularly frightening exampleand mass hysteria ensues.   Perhaps you remember the scare surrounding dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT), an insecticide banned in 1972 for being harmful not only to bugs, but also nearly every other living thing on the planet. More recently, you might have heard about bisphenol A (BPA)a cancerous compound found in many plastics and can liningsor the controversies surrounding mercury in deep-sea fish and Lord-knows-what in drinking water. Such scares are usually short lived thoughas soon as a politician says something hair-brained or a Kardashian embarrasses herself on video, the EDC nightmare of the moment fades into the background. But it doesnt go away. Indeed, it often gets worse.   Testament to this fact is the Endocrine Societys recently released  Second Scientific Statement on Endocrine-Disrupting Chemicals a compendium of EDC horror stories so terrifying that it might cause you not to leave your house, were it not for the fact that your house is every bit as toxic as anything else.   Okay, so perhaps I exaggerate. But still, the Endocrine Societys statement pulls no punches. Based on solid science and an impressive collection of clinical and epidemiological research, it points out that we have a serious, poorly-regulated problem on our hands thanks to a critical mass of insecticides, pesticides, plastics, cosmetics, cleaning products, solvents, and endless other chemicals messing with our hormones and potentially causing everything from obesity to cancer.      Whats an endocrine-disrupting chemical?   Your endocrine system is made up of a series of glands that produce hormones, which are chemical messengers that travel through your body to regulate various bodily functions, including metabolism, mood, and sex drive. They do this by attaching to receptors on cells and activating a specific response. Testosterone, estrogen, adrenaline, and insulin are all well-known hormones.   EDCs mimic hormones in that they also attach to receptors. Unfortunately, they just block them without delivering the right messages. Since you have a finite amount of receptors, this can be a problem. Think of EDCs as spam that takes up all the space in your physiological email server so that pertinent emails cant get through.   Take phthalateschemicals added to plastics, including many toys and some food and beverage containers, to make them more flexible and durable. Since phthalates dont actually bind chemically to plastic, its easy for them to leach into the environment, not to mention your lunch or your childs juice should either of you unwittingly eat or drink from phthalate-laced products. (In case youre wondering, the  Beachbody Portion Control Container Kit  is phthalate-free, so feel free to give our color-coded system to your kids as building blocks.)   While phthalates are useful in assuring little Jimmy doesnt accidentally snap his Maximum Jack action figure in two on Christmas morning,  studies  have linked them to reduced testosterone. Reduced testosterone, in turn, is associated with a host of issues beyond the, ahem, obvious one, including an increased risk of cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and obesity, according to a  study  in the journal  Diabetes Care . And according to the Endocrine Societys statement, a plethora of examples is emerging for increased disease susceptibility later in life as a function of developmental exposures to EDCs that include BPA, phthalates, PCBs, pesticides, dioxins, and tributyltin (TBT), among others.   If youre still focusing on that obesity thing, the Endocrine Societys report devotes some major real estate to the EDC/obesity link, going so far as to propose a whole subclass of obesogens, or EDCs that may be specifically linked to severe weight gain. So plastic can make you fat. Go figure.      What can you do?   The Endocrine Societys statement strongly recommends that EDCs and their impact be heavily researched, but given that the government is fairly lax in regulating these chemicals, exposure is a fact of modern life.   With this in mind, your best bet is to take control of the situation by educating yourself about EDCs and learning how to minimize your exposure. The Endocrine Societys 150-page statement may be a lot to chew on, so you can start with more easily digestible information such as the Hormone Health Networks  Scientific Statement  on Endocrine Disrupting Chemicals.   Once youre all knowledged-up, youll probably want to actively avoid EDCs. Reducing your exposure is particularly important if youre pregnant or have young children, whose developing bodies are especially susceptible. Eating fresh (preferably organic) produce and reducing your animal product intake are both smart ideas. (Note: Im not suggesting you stop eating meatjust dial it back a little.) There are also cleanses and detoxes that claim to help clear toxins from your system, such as Beachbodys Ultimate Reset. Are these products effective? Honestly, you cant completely purge a lifetime of chemicals in a few weeks. Whats more, youll just reintroduce them to your system if you resume old habits. But dont get me wrong, Im a strong advocate of these programs. Learning a few holistic practices, including how to restructure your diet to be healthier, is a great way to start removing EDCs from your life, especially if youre new to clean eating. Avoiding EDCs can be a major lifestyle overhaul, but diet is the foundation.   According to the   New York Times , only a fraction of the more than 80,000 chemicals in existence todayEDCs or otherwisehave been tested for safety. Theres no way to live completely off the EDC grid, so theres no point in stressing out. But it doesnt hurt to learn as much as you can, and do what you can to limit them in your life."

Single Mom Lost 100 Pounds in 9 Months and Won $1000!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/heather-lost-100-pounds-in-9-months-and-won-1000,"Heather O, age 31 from Auburn, MA, lost 100 lbs in nine months with  21 Day Fix ,  INSANITY MAX:30 , and  21 Day Fix EXTREME . She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,000!  Heather is an Independent Beachbody Coach.    Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  When I started this program I was so lost. I felt so miserable about they way I felt, and who I was as a person. I was having severe anxiety attacks that were life stopping. I was afraid to do anything for fear of everything in my life falling apart. I am a single mother to a beautiful little boy, but that in itself made life hard. While pregnant my ex would yell at me, and tell me how he couldnt believe someone so disgusting was carrying his child. I finally left this abusive relationship, but those words made me feel like I was worthless. I was so over weight, I was a smoker, and I was completely unhealthy. I didnt do anything, I went to work, and came home and ate. I did this in bed while I nursed my infant son. I was so miserable I would lie awake at night and just cry, because this is not how life was suppose to be. I was destined for bigger things than this, and I was just letting my life pass me by, and even worse the life of my child.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I would go on Facebook while I was pumping milk at work. I saw this woman I knew Dana and her journey. We both had been on the same synchronized swimming team growing up, and our stories were so much a like. We were both single mothers, and we had grown up together. I saw how happy she was, and I was so desperate for a change, that I reached out to her, and asked what she was doing. She told me all about Beachbody, and what it had done for her. Being that I was so broke, and I felt like I wasnt good enough to be part of Beachbody, I put it off for 5 months. I saw her over and over again having the time of her life, and I thought thatll never be me. Then one day it clicked, I could be a Coach, I could help other people. I signed up for the 21 Day Fix on November 11, 2014, and I havent looked back.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  The biggest challenge before I started Beachbody was my self esteem. I have always had such a low self esteem, and I have abused my body in every way. When I was growing up I was severely anorexic, and that lasted till college. I never thought I was good enough, or skinny enough. Then when I went off to college I became addicted to drugs trying to stay skinny and be perfect. My whole life fell apart, and the little esteem I had left was gone. Then I was in an abusive relationship that I thought I deserved, because I was such a bad person, and I allowed him to make me feel like I was less of a person. Since becoming part of team Beachbody, my esteem is the highest it has ever been in my life. I wake up everyday with a purpose, and the feeling of pride I have when I look at myself, is something I have never had in my entire life. I am now able to spread the good news of Beachbody, and help others who feel the same way I did. I no longer feel like I cant do anything, I now feel empowered.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I was so out of shape when I started 21 Day Fix, and I was intimidated by the workouts. Then I realized that there were modifiers and it made me feel empowered when I would finish one of the workouts. Then after awhile I could do it without using the modifiers, and that felt even better. I was drawn to being able to drink the shakes in the morning, while getting Declan ready for the day, and myself ready for work. I liked that I could eat normal food, that it was a diet it was a life style change. I could handle a life style change its diets that I could never do. I would say I was going to diet but then I would feel deprived and give up. I have done the 21 Day Fix, INSANITY MAX:30, and the 21 Day Fix EXTREME and they were all easy to follow meal plans.   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  My first round of the 21 Day Fix I lost 19 pounds in 21 days, then I did another round and lost an additional 6 pounds making a grand total of 25 pounds in a month in a half. Then I went on to do INSANITY MAX:30 and I started to see muscle definition, and that was something I hadnt seen in ten years. I lost 65 pounds doing two rounds of INSANITY MAX:30, and the muscles that I have are amazing. Then I wanted to get shredded so I did 21 Day Fix EXTREME and lost the last ten pounds to hit 100 pounds lost. I loved all the programs for what they did for my body. The achievement I am the most proud of is that I am able to run again. I loved running growing up, but being a smoker and over weight, well, that was just not happening. I quit smoking, and lost a 100 pounds. In June I ran a 10 mile road race pushing my son, and I ran the whole thing without stopping. Now I am training for a half marathon. Its all thanks to the programs and what they have done for my body.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I dont even know where to begin with how my life has changed. I could just cry right now thinking about the person that I was. I was the girl that allowed her boyfriend to put out lit cigarettes on her while she was pregnant because she just didnt have it in her to fight back. I had lost all of my drive and fight. I was solely surviving in life, and I would look at old people and be envious that they were on their way out because I didnt know if I could hold on anymore it was so hard to get up every day. Then I started Beachbody, and my life had done a 180. I am in a beautiful relationship with someone who adores me, and my son. I am big into my church, and I am so happy with life I am able to spread that happiness to everyone I meet. I wake up every morning with passion and drive. I want to live every moment, and I want to be the person that people look at and say because of you I didnt give up. My life has meaning now, and for that there is not enough thank yous in the world.     How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  When I first started the 21 Day Fix, I was hopeless. I had no idea what I was doing, or even how to beginning. I was placed into a Challenge Group that my Coach Dana ran, and the women in the Challenge Group were so motivating it helped me feel like I could do it. I always flourished when I was in a team setting, thats why I always did team sports growing up. The Challenge Group was like being part of a team again. It filled a void in me that had been left open for so long. I was able to succeed because of this team atmosphere and the accountability a Challenge Group provides. After 3 months of being in Danas Challenge Groups, I started my own Challenge Groups, and have been ever since. It helps me stay accountable, by being the person others are accountable to.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  My team Beachbody Coach is also my upline, and we have so much in common. When I was starting my journey, I was so nervous but Dana always had faith in me. She believed in me, and always was willing to help me grow. The day after I signed up for 21 Day Fix, I sat on the phone with Dana, and we discussed my hopes and dreams for hours. She opened something inside of me that was long dead, for so long I was almost afraid to hope and dream because I was holding on by a string in life. Growing up I was always setting these high goals, and dreams. Then life has a way of knocking you down, and you stop dreaming. Dana made me feel like it was okay to dream for a better life, for my son and I.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  Before my journey with Beachbody I had horrible insomnia, it was driving me insane. I would have panic attacks thinking about having to go to bed at night, because I would lay there and not be able to sleep. Then I would try to stay awake by drinking mass amounts of energy drinks. I had no energy, and I was almost going insane from the lack of sleep. It was so horrible, I cant even express how horrible this all was. I was trapped in this hell of unhealthy eating, and sleeplessness. After starting 21 Day Fix, and  Shakeology  I stopped drinking energy drinks, and had natural energy. I now have enough natural energy to get up at 5am to workout, then go to work, and when I get home run 3 miles. I do this all on top of being a single mother to an almost two year old. I was able to regulate my sleeping patterns, and I starting being able to feel normal.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?  Before I stared the 21 Day Fix, I had horrible stomach ulcers, and irritable bowl syndrome. I have had this my whole life. I was first diagnosed with ulcers when I was 12 years old, and I have had 7 endoscopies, and 5 colonoscopies because of these problems. I am only 31 and I have had so many doctors appointment, surgeries, and pain that I should be 80. I have no gallblatter because of my stomach issues, and I was afraid to go anywhere if there wasnt a bathroom close by. Since starting 21 Day Fix and  Shakeology  my stomach feels the best it has ever felt. I am off all ulcer medication, anti acids, and irritable bowl syndrome medications. I can go hiking, or go out boating without fear of having to use the restroom. I can eat like a normal person, and not have to carry medication with me all the time.   Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program? (e.g. Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, triglycerides, etc)  Before I started my journey with the 21 Day Fix my blood pressure was so high. They couldnt do anything to keep my pressure down, or even regulate it. It got so bad , that they had to take my son a month early, because I was so unhealthy. My blood pressure had me at such a risk of seizures, that they had to do an emergency c-section to get him out. I had to have padding on my hospital bed because they were just waiting for me to seize out because my pressure was going over 200, and they couldnt get it down. Even after he was born I was placed on high blood pressure medication, and it still did nothing for me. I had to go to the doctors every week to be monitored, and they just were trying to keep me stable. Since starting 21 Day Fix and drinking Shakeology I didnt even realize it at first but the sweating and heaviness I use to feel was going away. Then they took my pressure and it was perfect. Thats right perfect. I am perfecting medication free now!   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Supportive Challenge Group Helped Brittany Stick with Program and Lose 75 Pounds
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/supportive-challenge-group-helped-brittany-stick-with-program-and-lose-75-pounds,"Brittany S, age 22 from Renton, WA, lost 75 lbs with  Ultimate Reset ,  21 Day Fix , and  21 Day Fix EXTREME . She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  Before I started my journey I was miserable, thats the simplest way to put it. I was only 21 years old and obese. I had always had curves, but after I lost my thyroid at 19 I started gaining weight, and over the next 2 1/2 years I put on 100 pounds. I had to have my gall bladder removed because my weight yo-yod so much. I suffered from sever depression and anxiety to the point of attempting suicide. Chronic migraines (like 3-4 a week). I was on countless medications and then medications to cancel side effects from the other medications. I couldnt talk to people because I had such bad social anxiety. All of this at the age of 21. I used to be a  very  outgoing teenager and had a beautiful figure but my life completely crashed. I was so overweight that my husband and I couldnt start a family. I got pregnant once and miscarried which only worsened everything else. I used to cry when buying clothes because I didnt want to look in the mirror. My life was just a downward spiral, and it was slowly killing me.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  What really hit home was when my husband snapped a picture of me and I went back and looked at it and I didnt even recognize myself. I honestly thought it was someone else. I kept thinking there is no way I have gotten that big. I knew I was sick and needed to make a change, doctors kept telling me that if I wanted to start a family I needed to get things in order. I had already suffered one miscarriage and that was going to keep happening if I didnt change   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  My biggest challenge was finding the motivation. I had done so many programs in the past. I had pretty much been dieting since I was 14. But I had started and quit them all. I had never been able to stick to one for longer than 3 weeks. But having the Challenge Groups and my Coach to push me was amazing. It kept me going. I also flooded my Facebook feed with positive influences. People who were on this journey with me or people who had already reached there goal. I would listen to them tell their story, and that pushed me. I wanted to have that after picture. One like they had. I had people that pushed me on the days when I didnt want to work out. I had my mom who was the person who signed me up. She would call me and ask if I had done my workout yet or if I had drank my  Shakeology . It was that constant reminder and motivation that kept me going.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I started with the 21 Day Fix and Shakeology. My favorite part was the meal plan. I  hated  counting calories and the containers made it so easy for me. I am a visual person so seeing my food and the amount I should eat was  wonderful ! I loved that the workouts were only 30 minutes and that if I needed to modify something there was that option. The energy that autumn exuded helped with my depression because with that type of energy there was no way my energy couldnt match hers.     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  My first round I lost 12 pounds and I cant even remember how many inches. And each round I did after that was fueled by my results from the following round. I started to see a change in myself and other people could see it too. Ive lost  75 pounds and 8 pant sizes ! I tallied up the inches I lost and if I remember that number right it was 50+ total inches. I have never had something work like this for me. Although my physical change has been astounding, the change Im most proud of is the one that took place inside. The one that not everyone can see.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  Im no longer on medications; I only have to take one! and thats to help my non existent thyroid. I dont deal with suicidal thoughts anymore. I dont have to stay in bed because my depression makes it so I cant get out. Yes I still have some bad days, but those days are so few and far between. Im not in the hospital every other week with debilitating migraines being pumped full of narcotics. I can actually talk to people now and dont have social anxiety. I no longer have to take anxiety medications to feel numb. I feel comfortable in my own skin and have started to love myself again. I look forward to shopping because I know I will be able to fit into clothes. I can actually find hobbies I like to do because Im fit enough to try things. I can finally start trying to have a family because my body can with stand it. But most of all, I can be an inspiration to others who are dealing with the same things that I used to go through. I can show people they can change there life!   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  Seeing everyone around me reach for their goals and struggle with some of the same things I struggled with was just inspiring. And made me realize I wasnt the only person out there. That there are people who deal with the same things. And it helped me realize that it was okay for me to ask for help.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  My mom is my Coach so I had a little bit of an edge, but we supported each other. In the mornings we would call each other and work out together over Facetime. and not let each other quit. We would remind each other that we had to drink our Shakeology. Having someone other than myself to focus on pushed me to become better, because I wanted to keep up with her.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  During the times when I started to plateau the Ultimate Reset and the  3-Day Refresh  helped me to kick it up a notch and give me that extra boost I needed to keep from giving up. I honestly believe Shakeology is what helped rid me of my migraines, granted it was probably because I was improving my overall lifestyle, but I started to feel so much better after I had been drinking it for several weeks. Shakeology helped give me the energy in the morning that I needed so that by the end of the day I was actually tired. Helping me deal with my insomnia. And because of all that I had a better outlook on life. I was able to focus on things because I wasnt tired and wasnt feeling the grips of depression. Because I no longer had a gall bladder my stomach was all messed up and it helped to keep things moving and it was one thing I could count on not upsetting my stomach.

Single Mom Lost 68 Pound, Now a Bikini Competitor!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/single-mom-lost-68-lbs-now-bikini-competitor,"See the inspirational story of Kailin Turner, a military vet and single mom who overcame significant challenges in her personal life to achieve an extraordinary, award-winning fitness transformation.  She lost 68 pounds with a variety of Beachbody programs, and your votes  helped her win $6,500 in the Beachbody Challenge !     Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I almost didnt realize what I looked like. I was a large girl with a skinny mind. Growing up I had never been really small (at the height of 57 by late middle school) but I was never big either. I enlisted into the military where I got down to my smallest, at a size 8, but after training I ballooned up to a size 18 jean in a little under 2 years. I was going through fertility issues and was depressed, not focused on my health and fitness, and soon found myself so uncomfortable in my own skin.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  The first inspiration was to not move up to a size 20 jean. I was bursting out of my size 18 and just couldnt take it anymore. I wanted to ultimately surprise my family by losing the weight and so that kept me going. I just wanted to feel good about myself again. A big motivator was also that I wanted to have a child and start a family and weight was holding me back.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  Divorce. Right in the middle of  P90X / INSANITY  hybrid I got an email from my deployed husband saying he wanted a divorce and nothing would change his mind. I was so shocked. Most people would have grabbed a tub of ice cream and given up on their workouts But even the day I found out, I worked out. Somehow I kept going and I actually finished. That round I ended up losing 50 pounds in 90 days; with a divorce and a cross state move, I did pretty well! After that I became pregnant within the next year, and had such a tough pregnancy that it landed me in the hospital on bed rest where I lost any muscle I gained with P90X. I was caring for a preemie and was weak from the stay. I actually took two years off. Now I am a single mother to a little girl and while its tough, I make my way through my workout each day so I can feel amazing inside and out.     What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  With P90X, it was that it worked  quick . I lost a substantial amount of weight each week just by doing my workout everyday and drinking my  Shakeology . With INSANITY it was the fact that I mentally had to gain some strength and dig as deep as I could within me to finish. With  FOCUS T25 , it was the fact that I was a single working mom and I needed something quick but really effective. With  Body Beast  it was the simple fact I didnt have to do a lot of cardio and I got shredded. With  21 Day Fix EXTREME  it was that it really taught me how to eat the cleanest I could possibly ever eat, and I leaned out quickly by really dialing in my nutrition.   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I went from a size 18 to a size 2 all by working out with Beachbody Programs. I am proud to say that I could get these results  at home  in a short amount of time each day. I am proud that I stuck with it, no matter how long it took me, I stuck with it, I trusted the process and it worked. I went from feeling awful about myself to being confident and proud. Not all women can truly say they love their bodies. But I can definitely say that now. I am proud to have signed up for my first bikini competition; no matter where I place, I will be  very  proud.     How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I went from super unhealthy to healthy. I have gone from following people to leading and inspiring people. The biggest difference my life has faced is really helping other women feel confident about who they are, give them advice, and share the knowledge I have to help them achieve their fitness goals. I am also a happier mother. I have time with my little girl because I work out at home, yet I still have that me time to focus on what I want in life as well.    How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  She did the 21 Day Fix EXTREME with me. We both have ups and downs or times we really wanted some sweets. We would just message each other and keep each other in check and let each other know we only have a couple days left!   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  Oh! Shakeology is a must for me every single day. Its my breakfast meal replacement and I wouldnt go a day without it. I know that it has helped me create the results I now have. It kept me full and kept me away from craving sweets (I used to crave candy badly!). On days I felt like I was too busy to cook dinner I would also have Shakeology for dinner with something like fruit or a complex carb. It was super convenient for this busy mom!     You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Hummus and Ice Cream Recalled Due to Possible Listeria Contamination
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/hummus-ice-cream-recalled-listeria-contamination,"If you recently purchased hummus from Sabra or ice cream products from Blue Bell Creameries, you might be affected by a nationwide recall. Both companies made the announcement due to possible  Listeria monocytogenes contamination.   Sabra, a well-known brand of hummus, voluntarily recalled some 30,000 cases after a  container tested positive in Michigan . The  CDC released a statement yesterday , listing the five different product UPC codes that are being recalled. (You can look for these on the top of the products.) All of the containers have a best before date of May 11 and May 15. The CDC says all of the U.S. is affected and should either throw out the product or return the item for a refund.   Blue Bell Creameries has made multiple recalls of their products over the past few days due to the same fear of contamination.  Here is the press release and product information  listed on their site. Over 20 states sell these products. There have even  been confirmed cases of foodborne illness in Texas  from Blue Bell ice cream.   Listeria is known to affect pregnant woman, children, and those with weakened immune systems. It can cause fever, muscle aches, and more. The CDC offers more detailed information on their  website ."

Randi Lost 150 LBS and Won Over $100,000 in Beachbody Challenge!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/true-change-from-inside-out,"Randi Hernandez, age 53 from Seward, NE, lost 150 pounds in 10 months with the 21 Day Fix  and  Shakeology.  Your votes  helped her win over $100,000 in  the Beachbody Challenge  contest and the title of Grand Prize Champion 2015!     $100,000 Grand Prize Champion Randi Hernandes (left) with her sister/ CoachRita Shultz (right), who won $20,000 for helping Randi reclaim her health.   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I have been obese almost all my life. I was in an abusive marriage for 15 years, where daily I was told how fat and ugly I was. I felt hopeless. So I would make myself feel better by eating. My food was my friendit would never judge me. My weight kept going up and I kept going down. Down so far, I hated myself. My marriage ended. But my addiction to food did not. Years later, I married again, and found out I was pregnant. 5 months pregnant! I was shocked, and in disbelief. But great news, I could eat for 2 now! After all, I was pregnant. As the years went by, I kept getting heavier and the feelings of self hate kept building. My daughter was now being affected. When there was a school function or activity to attend, I would have to sit in the back of the room where no one would see me. My daughter would not even acknowledge me. No eye contact or even a glance my way for a smile. Now that, that cut me to my core. But it still did  not  wake me up to my obesity, and my unhealthy life style.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I was to the point where I struggled to move. Driving my car was really bad. To reach the pedals I had to move my seat up. My stomach would push into the steering wheel so I could barely steer the car.  Scary ! I couldnt bend down to tie my shoes. I got winded just walking through a store. I was ashamed. Theres not enough space to write all the activities, and daily tasks, I couldnt do because of my weight. My sisters bugged me for years to do Beachbody workouts. I told them I get all the exercise I needed at my maintenance job. I was lying to myself and them, and we all knew it. I kept believing that lie until one day I  really  saw myself in a mirror. I couldnt stop looking at the person looking back at me. I broke down and cried out loud; What have you done to yourself!  Why ! I screamed at myself. I looked over at my daughters picture- it was like she could see me. I felt so disgusted, and so ashamed that I could barely breathe. I weighed almost 300lbs at 52! I started my Beachbody program at age 52.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  The biggest challenge I faced was my attitude. I had failed so many times before, and this exercise program was no different. All I could say to myself was negative things, things I have said over and over hundreds of times in my head. This had molded me into the person I had become. It was so much easier to believe negative things. I did this for so long. I thought changing would be impossible. I told myself its not going to work and Ill prove it. I told my sister I would try the program, just to get her off my back. I had  no  intention of actually doing it because I already knew it would not work. Little did I know! My sister (Coach) kept asking me if I had received my  21 Day Fix  and  Shakeology . Well I had, and she said we were starting at 5:30AM Monday. I said no, she said yes. She said Well, Im going to call you so answer your phone! Monday came, and my phone rang at 5:30AM. I thought, if she believes in me that much I guess Ill give it a try. That first workout made me a believer. I could do it!     What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I chose the Beachbody workout program my Coach recommended, which was the  21 Day Fix  and  Shakeology . What a perfect fit for me! I love it so much, Ive been doing it for 10 months now and counting. I love the portion cups, and nutrition guide, it is easy to follow. The workouts are actually fun and I enjoy them. Autumns pep talks during the workouts are inspiring. She says to Take the word cant out of your vocabulary! So I did. Now I know I  can ! It is  not  impossible. I learned how to eat right and that the right foods are used to give my body fuel. I felt full and, most of the time, I did not even eat all the food that I could have on the program. Autumn taught me it was not about eating less, it is about eating right. And it is not about being skinny, it is about being healthy.   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?   Since starting the 21 Day Fix I have lost 150lbs. I have lost 100 inches overall. I am proud of not quitting. This time I am  not  a failure. I have gained a feeling of self worth, and self respectlike I matter! I finally  matter ! I can walk with my head held high, and Im not afraid of how others look at me. I actually love how people look at me now. Although, I have to say, it is a change to hear how great I look- Im still getting used to that! Beachbody has made my hopes and dreams into a reality. Im healthy, happy, and so blessed. My daughter can look at me now and see that I am strong and confident, and this time I succeeded. I am the most proud of being this kind of example for my daughter.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?   The changes in my life have been amazing. I never thought any of this was possible. My whole way of life has changed. The way I see myself now its like I stepped out of this huge confinement, only it was my huge body. I feel my mind is clear, and not trapped with self hate and negative thoughts. I feel strong and confident. Most of all, my daughter is proud of me. She looks at me differently now, and does not hesitate to give me words of support. She even acknowledged me at a school function by saying Thats my mom; doesnt she look great? This is why Beachbody is so dear to me. Beachbody gave me my life back. A true change from the inside out. My food addiction is  gone ! It has been replaced with my love of being healthy, and exercise. And my newest love  Me !     How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  The Challenge Group I was a part of was a fun Group. One of my keys to success was being part of this Group. When I thought I could not go on, someone in the Group would remind me that it is hard work, but worth working hard for. It is also a way to stay connected with others while on my fitness journey. Ive made a lot of new fitness friends. I know I will continue to be in a Group because I feel I can return the favor by being an inspiration to others.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  My Coach Rita, would call me daily. Coach Rita is so busy, but she was never too busy to give me daily encouragement with a phone call or text. She would also ask me about food intake, and if I was following the nutrition guide and using the containers that came with the 21 Day Fix. She would also give me tips, and share recipes to try with Shakeology. When I lost my first 20lbs, I didnt know if I was more excited or if she was! Ritas support was extremely valuable to my success. I couldnt have done it without her. I want to someday soon be an inspiration to others, as she has been to me.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  I cant say enough wonderful things about  Shakeology . I will always use this product. I love it! It definitely helps me with my cravings, and it gives me energy! My digestive system is regular now. I have an overall healthy feeling about my body. Thank you for creating this super, wonderful, nutrition packed shake! I never in my life would have thought that drinking a shake everyday would make me this healthy!   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?  Before I started with my Beachbody program, and Shakeology, I took medicine for my stomach. I also took blood pressure medicine. I had very bad acid reflux, so I took medicine for that too. I was a mess! My Dr. had been warning me for years to make a change, and to lose weight. But I did not listen to him. My addiction to food was too strong to take his advice. He said if I kept going down the path I was on, I probably wouldnt live long. Recently, I went in for a check up and my Dr. almost did not recognize me. He was amazed at my weight loss, success, and overall great health. He asked me how I was doing it. I told him I had been doing a Beachbody workout called 21 Day Fix and drinking Shakeology. He had heard of it, and advised me not to change a thing! And to continue drinking Shakeology because the health benefits were obvious.    Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program? (e.g. Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, triglycerides, etc)  With doing Beachbody workouts, and drinking Shakeology daily, I no longer take blood pressure pills, stomach pills, or acid reflux medicine! My husband says I dont snore any more. I can safely drive my car! I thought I was too old at 52 to start a healthy way of living, and lose weight. That is just  not  true. Ill be honest, the hardest part was starting. I think about it now, and the only regret I have is not  starting  sooner! Now I love the way I feel. I love the way I look. I love the way my daughter sees me. I love the way my husband whistles at me. But most of allI love  Me . Thank you Beachbody!     You can change your life, too.

Ask the Expert: When Should I Listen to My Cravings?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/ask-expert-listen-cravings,"Cravings can be intenseand often they go way beyond minor hankering. Surely, it cant just be that you want chocolate. There must be some reason that you need chocolate. Come on, please! Just a taste.   Unfortunately, you probably dont. In most cases, cravings arent a physiological function telling you what you need. In fact, its much more likely that theyre a dys function.   You might be aware of an infographic floating around the Interwebs featuring foods that people typically crave, along with micronutrients that (supposedly) trigger those cravings. If you desire bread, toast, or pasta, the graphic suggests you need more nitrogen in your diet. Salty foods mean you need chloride, chocolate suggests a need for magnesium, etc. You may notice a complete lack of references at the bottom of this chart. Thats probably because theres no science backing up these claimswhatsoever. While the craving might stem from something more obvioussugar, for exampleits highly unlikely that your yen for chocolate means you need more magnesium in your diet.      Why Do I Crave Chocolate and Other Foods That Arent Good For Me?  Cravings are far more complex than this cause-and-effect chart suggests. While a subtle nutrient need may be partly to blame, cravings arise for several reasonsand tend to include a tangled web of psychology, hormones, and other physiological issues.   Lets go back to the chocolate/magnesium connection. By the time chocolate gets to the milked-down form most Americans consume, theres not much magnesium left. One ounce of milk chocolate contains just 4% of the recommended daily value for magnesium. Dark chocolate has 16%.   Why would the body seek out a food for a specific nutrient when that food has very little of that nutrient? Wouldnt it make more sense that your body would crave foods richer in magnesium, such as nuts, leafy greens, or beans? Your chocolate cravings probably exist for more insidious reasons. Some research shows similarities between chocolate cravings and alcohol addiction, in that both alcohol and cacao contain similar neuroactive alkaloids (chemicals that tweak your melon). In other words, research suggests that chocolate is addictive.   Another reason you could be craving that brownie is because of your emotional history with it. Its one of the great American comfort foods. Were brought up identifying chocolate with birthdays, Halloween, post-soccer game ice cream outings, and all those magic moments when you were a good little boy or girl who deserved a reward. If you cant see how that would etch a positive association neural pathway deep into your gray matter, we need to get Dr. Freud on the horn, stat.   Furthermore, unless you like chewing on cacao nibs (and some people do!), the chocolate you consume is filled with sugarand sugar cranks up the feel good hormone serotonin (among other chemicals) levels in your brain, giving you a feeling of mild euphoria. When its gone, you want more . Combine this sugar hit with the emotional issues and youve got one powerful craving.   Im not ruling out the possibility of a causal relationship between cravings and micronutrientsbut the key word here is possibility . For instance, when I first began road cycling seriously, I found myself with an irresistible craving for potato chips. It was only when I started adding sea salt to my recovery drink that those cravings passed. Similarly, pregnant women often crave foods that are high in nutrients they need. For example, she might crave cheeseburgersan obvious source of calcium and iron.   If youre convinced that your particular craving stems from a micronutrient deficiency, theres an easy way to test this: supplement the vitamin or mineral you have in mind. Getting back to chocolate, if you buy into the magnesium thing, try supplementing. Another angle would be to embrace the psychology aspect of cravings and instead grab a bag of  Chocolate Shakeology , so that you can indulge yourself, but in a healthy way. (Not to beat a dead horse, but a serving of Shakeology contains 20% of the recommended daily value of magnesium.)      So I Shouldnt Trust My Cravings?  Maybe sometimes. With all this talk of micronutrients, weve overlooked another possible root cause for your cravinga macro nutrient deficiency. You could be craving certain foodsor certain food typesbecause your balance of carbs, protein, and fat is off. While its a stretch to assume your body desires a food because it contains trace amounts of a certain mineral, the causal link between foods and macronutrients (carbs, protein, and fat) is obvious. Eat a piece of carb-heavy cake and youre going to spike your blood sugar.   If you think this may be the case, feed the craving with healthy food. If youre craving sweet things, increase your fruit and veggie intake. If you crave greasy foods, increase your raw nut or avocado (good fats) intake. If you find yourself craving meat and cheese, increase your lean protein intake with chicken, fish, eggs, and legumes. If you do this and it doesnt work, odds are that your cravings are more psychologically based.   If youre deliberately eating at a calorie deficit, this method can be a problem. Ultimately, youre not getting enough of any macronutrient. In these situations, it might be useful to adjust the balance of carbs/protein/fat in your diet. So, for example, if youre in the middle of phase one of P90X and youre jonesin for sweet stuff, try switching to phase two, which features a carb increase.   Cravings suck. And when youre trying to lose weight, they suck even more, as calorie deficits tend to increase cravings . In our most frustrated, give-me-the-donut-before-I-kill-someone moments, wed all like a simple solution. Unfortunately, it doesnt exist. Finding your way around cravings requires a little patience and experimentation. Its just a matter of finding a healthy substitute, a little willpoweror some combination thereof.      What foods do you crave?"

Find Out How this Mother of Two Lost 75 LBS and Won $2,500
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/mother-of-two-lost-75-lbs-won,"Erin T, age 29 from North Huntingdon, PA, lost 75 lbs with  FOCUS T25 ,  21 Day Fix ,  Shakeology , and  3-Day Refresh . She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $2,500!  Erin is an Independent Team Beachbody Coach.   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  Before I started with Beachbody, my life looked like a fairy tale from the outside looking in. But on the inside, I was a mess  I was dealing with postpartum depression on top of the anxiety I had.   I hated my body, and I never thought I was worth the time or money. My lack of confidence flowed into every area of my life  I never wanted to go anywhere and I would make excuses as to why I could not go, I never bought myself anything new because I felt like it would never look good on me anyways, I was uncomfortable even in front of my own husband which caused issues in our marriage. I felt like I was trapped in a fat suit, my reflection wasnt who I was on the inside.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  My inspiration, the heart beat behind my transformation is my daughters. I wondered how I could teach them to have confidence and love themselves, if I didnt love my self. I wanted to raise these confident, happy, fierce girls and I knew that action would speak louder than words and I had to show them how to be all those things! My biggest fear is that they would grow up and be like me (well the old me)  depressed, anxious, no confidence, unhealthy. Secondly, it was important for me to work on my marriage. I knew a lot of the underlying issues where my issues. I didnt think I was worthy of being loved, I was closed off, and it was a huge block in my life.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  I had a lot of excuses. My husband and I work opposite shifts, my girls are young and require a lot of attention, I felt like I had to much to lose and that it was helpless. Beachbody helped to set small goals so I didnt think about the big picture, but had small victories along the way. Beachbody also helped by providing workouts that were short  prior to Beachbody, I thought I had to spend hours in the gym and I never imagined I would get results like this in 30 minutes a day or less! Shakeology helped fight my carb and sweet cravings so I could skip the night time cereal or ice cream because I knew in the morning I was going to get my sweet fix with the shakes. The shakes fueled my body and I could feel a distinct difference between my cravings, energy level, and mood.     What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I chose T25 primarily because of the 25 min workouts. My husband works long hours and his schedule is busy. I needed something I knew I could fit into my daily life. I knew if I chose a program that took too much time then I would never stick to it. After completing T25, I started The 21 Day Fix, mainly because I knew I needed to work on the nutrition aspect of my transformation. I thought that after T25, the 21 Day Fix workouts would be easy  man was I wrong! The workouts were intense, the nutrition was amazing and I think I will continue using the meal plan with every program I do because it is simple and works!   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  Prior to Beachbody, I would lose weight, then it would stall then I would get frustrated and stop and gain it all back. So when I lost 30 lbs in 60 days and then kept losing it  I was floored! To date, I have lost 75 pounds  that is more weight than the weight of both my kids! I think what I am most proud of is my confidence level, I am wearing a bikini! I am looking people in the eyes again, I can hold my head high and I am the example I wanted to be for my girls. I am proud that I can run with my girls, lift them up, throw them in the air, take them places, and just show them how wonderful life is. When I see my transformation photos, I can not even believe it myself! I am the healthy fit mom that I always wanted to me  my reflection is finally how I feel inside and how I wanted to feel for so long. I dont feel trapped, I feel alive and I am finally who my family deserves me to be!   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  Beachbody has changed my entire life, easily one of the best decisions of my life. I have the energy to be the mom I wanted to be. I have the strength and confidence to teach my girls how to be strong, powerful women. My marriage has improved because of my increased confidence and improved mood. I am proud of my successes with my body and I am not hesitant to go out anymore. I realized that investing a little bit of time into myself, I am a better wife, mom and person. I am so proud that I have used my platform to change the lives so many! I am chasing my daughter on her bike while pushing a stroller up a hill, I am no longer making excuses to hang out at the pool, and my daughters lives have changed as well. My 5 year old exercises with me, she asks me about healthy choices, they arent drinking juice, we traded chicken nuggets for grilled chicken and white pasta for whole wheat!   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  The Challenge Group helped me tremendously. When I didnt know what to eat, when I didnt feel like pushing play I knew I had peer support and the support of my coach to get me through when I wasnt strong. The group was fun and supportive. I love the recipes my coach would post, the fun assignments (most sweaty selfies and meal photos) and the inspiring quotes.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  My coach was there for me every step of the way.  Shakeology  recipes, clean eating tips, workout tips, answering questions for me. I could not have done this without her. My coach was there for me in the group and outside the group. Always willing to give me extra support or answer any questions. She helped me celebrate every small victory along the way!   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  Shakeology was pivotal in my transformation. I experienced increased energy and I slept better. Shakeology tastes so amazing, it was a sweet treat for me every morning. It kept me full. I was able skip my night time snacking, which was huge for me. Prior to Shakeology, I had a bowl of cereal or ice cream every night. I never thought I would be able to give that up, but I did without a single issue. I noticed a change in my mood and was finally experiencing more regularity.    How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?  I have hypothyroidism and I thought losing weight was going to be almost impossible for me. Everything else I ever tried, I would lose a few pounds and then the weight loss would stop no matter what I did. My dose of Synthroid was always changing, but my dose has been stable than ever! o   You can change your life, too.

Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I didnt feel completely sad because I just had my beautiful princess, but I felt uncomfortable, out of shape, big, and just thinking if I was going to be able to lose all that body fat from my both pregnancy and be the same person that used to do INSANITY before.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I was in the hospital the night before I had my second baby and the commercial for FOCUS T25 came up. I thought it was perfect for me because my life was about to get a lilt more busier and intense that it used to be. So as crazy and funny as it sounds, I bought the workout the same day my baby was born. I was determined to get my body back.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program?  I was out of shape. I felt like I did not have the power to finish each workout, and even though I used to workout before; I did not have time to recover from my first baby and I found out later on that we were pregnant again, so, it was like I started from zero. But, One thing I know, I can say now that it was one of the best decisions Ive made. So happy that I took the challenge.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  The time was just perfect. Shaun T made it all so easy and I loved the way he was able to inspire me, keep me focus and made me work hard for those 25 minutes everyday.

Autumn Calabrese’s Tips on How to Stop Making Excuses
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/autumn-calabreses-tips-on-how-to-stop-making-excuses,"Autumns a petite Italian mom from Cleveland, but dont underestimate the trainer behind the  21 Day Fix . This single mom with more than 10 years of personal training under her belt has gotten countless clients where they want to gowhether that meant losing ten pounds, a hundred pounds, or getting their body back after becoming a mom.   Shes in amazing shape now, but as a teenager, she struggled with her weight and still battles cravings, a tight schedule, and mornings when she just doesnt feel like working out. Get ready to be inspired by the story of our newest trainer and find out how to stop making excuses and start seeing results.      Ok, lets cut right to the chase. Have you always looked like a model?  No. When I was a teenager, I was that girl with frizzy hair and braces who got picked on all the timeI dont want people to look at me and think, oh you dont know, its so easy for you. Because there was a time when it wasnt.        When did that change?   I started dancing when I was in eighth grade. At first, it was one or two classes a week, but the next year my teacher wanted me competing, which meant I had to take a certain number of classes a week; the more classes I took, the more I wanted to take. Our teacher would talk to us about healthy eating and not drinking soda and that sort of thing so that we could give our best performances. I remember I cut soda out and three weeks after I did it, I walked into dance class one day and everyone stopped and was like, what the heck? They noticed it overnight. I lost five or six pounds, which on my frame, is a lot! But, they would  never  talk about you should be this skinny or say youre too fat. I think that made a huge impact on how I work with people. My big philosophy is learning how to eat clean and enjoying everything in moderation.      How do your experiences as a teenager influence your training style?  Im not the trainer that is going to scream at somebody and be like, do it, do it, do it. Im never going to put someone down. Im always going to be the cheerleader for you and encourage you to reach your goals. Ive been there. I was the underdog.      How did you get into personal training?  I came to Los Angeles wanting to act and dance. But, I have a bulging disc in my lower spine so I still couldnt dance as much as I wanted to. I could book a commercial, but I could never book a tour. I could never be on Broadway because my back couldnt handle that. I pursued acting and have my SAG card and did a commercial here and there, but I was waiting tables the whole time. I waited tables from the time I was 16 to the time I was 25, and was burnt out. I needed to figure out something else to do. I didnt want to sit at a desk, but I didnt want to teach dance either. I didnt want to get burnt out on it. I looked into personal training certifications, got certified through the National Academy of Sports Medicine (NASM), and started training. Then a couple years later, I became pre- and post-natal certified.        Speaking of which, youre a mom. Was it hard for you to lose the baby weight after having your son?   There was a point when I hit a plateau and I was like, OK, this is a bummer, but I stopped making it about the weight and made it about challenging myself in other ways. Could I lift just a little bit heavier? If I was out for a run, could I run a little bit further or a little bit faster? Could I put the baby in the stroller and push him because thats going to give me more resistance? The weight ended up coming off and I ended up five pounds lighter than before I got pregnant.      Did you try and stay fit when you were pregnant?  I worked out throughout my entire pregnancy. I was in the gym in the morning and went into labor that night. I still gained 36 pounds during my pregnancy and I had a C-section. My goal was to get the baby weight off in 12 weeks, but first I had to recover from the C-section, so it wasnt like I could go back to working out the day I got home. But, the one thing I could do was go back to my healthy eating. I was breast-feeding so I made sure I was eating enough for myself and for him, but I made healthy choices. When I could get back to working out, I did.      Wasnt that hard? How did you make the time?  This is the one time youll see the tougher side of me. I dont have patience for excuses. Ive had a C-section, Ive had a hernia, and I have a bulging disc in my lower back. For the last 10 years, Ive worked 12-hour days. And it wasnt like I only worked out with my clients. I had to find time in between being a single mom. And I still do it. And you can too. You can either make excuses, or you can make results. How bad do you want it? What are you really willing to sacrifice? Yes, there are sacrifices. Yes, there are mornings I dont want to go to the gym. There are times Id rather eat chocolate cake than broccoli. But, at the end of the day, I love feeling good about myself. I love having energy to keep up with my son. I love when I put on my jeans and they fit or when I put on a tight dress and it looks good.      Youre making me want to work out right now. Where did the idea for the 21 Day Fix come from?   I started working for Brooke Burkes site Modern Mom and picked up some celebrity clients. Then two years ago, I had the aha moment that I needed to develop something for my clients where theyre going to understand the nutrition side. I was saying, eat three or four or five ounces of chicken. But no one wanted to go get the scale and measure it. I finally sat down with a nutritionist and started brainstorming. We broke down the food groups and came up with 13 different container sizes to fit them. One of my goals was to not eliminate food but teach you how to integrate foods without overdoing it. The goal isnt to be perfect. The goal isnt to not enjoy life. Everyone has to have a glass of wine at some point and a girls got to have a piece of chocolate. But, the goal is not to do it every single day.   Americas problem is we overeat everythingeven the healthy stuff.      Not the lack of exercise?  Its both, but I think at the end of the day, in terms of your weight, its more about what you eat. If youre eating healthy and youre in the right calorie zone, you should be at your proper weight. Exercise will improve your muscles, your flexibility, and your endurance, keep the weight down, and change the appearance of your body. But I see it all the time. Those people who go to the gym five to six days a week but dont eat right are all still overweight. They look the same as they did three years ago. I think looking like youre strong and fit looks better than skinny fat.      What is your cheat food?  I am usually a cookie or a chocolate person. But, Ive gone so long now without it that when I have it, the sugar rush is too intense. I get headaches and feel nauseous. But, if its that time of the month, I want sweets and every so often a piece of pizza, though I dont eat dairy anymore. But, to be perfectly honest, I dont keep crap in my house. I know what my weaknesses are. I know if you catch me in a bad emotional state and there are Oreos in the house, Im not eating oneIm eating the entire row. Ill feel sick later and Ill make myself pay for it in the gym, but if its there, Im going to eat it. And if its not there, Im not going to get in the car, drive to the store, and buy it. So I might go to bed angry about it and be like, I wish I had some damn chocolate, but Ill get over it.      OK, back to the containers. How do they help?   We kept them pretty simple. People dont have time to cook gourmet meals, so I based a lot of it on how I had to prep for competition. At the very beginning, it was chicken and Mrs. Dash, 5 meals a day. I was like, OK, I can have turkey, I can have steak, I can have fish. I can buy all the different Mrs. Dash seasonings instead of the same one. Or I can make a stir-fry out of it, I use oil and Mrs. Dash flavors instead of soy sauce. Ive gotten creative, but it takes time. In the beginning, it was like, the recipe says chicken, Im making chicken.      Some people who might want to do the 21 Day Fix have a lot of weight to lose. Any thoughts on how they can get a good start and then stay motivated?  The biggest thing is to have a support system around you. Have that conversation where you say to your household:  This is important to me. Im trying to make a change. Im not forcing you to do it, but I need your support. Please dont try to push me to have things Im not supposed to have.  Or, if youre the head of the household, you just say,  This is what were doing.  I think its important for parents to lead by example. But, at the end of the day, you have to make the commitment to yourself and the only person you have to report to is yourself. Thats a switch that you individually have to figure out how to turn on. Until you can, your weight is going to fluctuate up and down and youll find excuses. Its 21 days. See where you get in 21 days. You may not be perfect. You might cheat. You might have setbacks. But you also cant let those determine how the rest of the future looks. If you cheat, acknowledge it, figure out what triggered it, and get right back on the horse.      One of the things I loved about the 21 Day Fix was how awesome my legs and butt looked after three weeks. Why the emphasis on the lower body?  The biggest muscle groups are in the lower body, so thats where youll get the biggest calorie burn. Second, its important to be balanced in your upper and lower body. And, finally, Im a leg girl. Im a dancer. I think strong, toned legs are sexy and appealing. And, a guy with scrawny legs? Come on! Youre out. Out! I shouldnt be able to squat more than you."

5 Things My Baby Taught Me About Healthy Eating
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/5-things-my-baby-taught-me-about-healthy-eating,"When I introduced my baby daughter to solid foods, I thought Id be the one to shape her attitudes about food, healthyeating habits, and table manners. But little did I know that in between mashing banana on the wall and painting her face with avocado, she would be the one teaching  me  how to eat.   Heres what Ive learned about healthy eating from my little one so far.      1. Try a New Food Again. And Again.      I always thought my food dislikes were innate. Thats why I wasnt surprised when my daughter spit out the piece of tomato I fed her. Blech, she said, red juice dripping down her chin. But I would be wrong to give up. A study of 7-month-old infants suggests that if you repeatedly introduce a new food, even if the baby dislikes it, she will learn to like it .   So, if at first you dont succeed, try, try again  at least eight more times, according to researchers. When a vegetable is initially disliked it is worth persisting in feeding it for at least eight subsequent meals.   Over the years, Ive learned to tolerate tomatoes, but perhaps I need repeated exposure to olives?!        2. One at a Time, Please      At restaurants and at home, we love a colorful plate filled with protein, veggies, and a bit of carbs. I was tempted to fill my babys high-chair tray with a little bit of this and that. But Ive found that too much variety on the tray confuses my daughter. Why should she eat her string cheese if theres a sweet strawberry within reach?   By limiting the options, you can find out what your baby really likes and help them make good choices.   Im not saying we as adults should just limit one food to our plates  but perhaps  too  much variety can be a bad thing. Studies show that  the more choices you have, the harder it is to maintain self-control . So I skip the pu pu platter and the dessert tray if I want to make healthier choices.      3. Hold the Salt!      But isnt that too bland? my husband said, as I prepared steamed broccoli and roasted cauliflower for the baby.   Heres the thing: We might think baby food might be too boring, but when babies switch from an all-liquid diet of formula or breast milk ( which has as many flavors as mom eats ) to solid food, its a whole new world of tastes, textures, and flavors to them, so theres no need to add salt to the mix.   When we first dove into this project, the question was why herbs and spices?' write Alessandra Macaluso and Amy Godiwalla, authors of  What a Good Eater!,  a cookbook of nutritious recipes for babies and toddlers. During their research, they found that in other countries and cultures, parents added herbs and spices to their babies diets right away, so the question turned into Why  not  herbs and spices?   And since Americans  eat too much salt , Ive started subbing in basil, garlic, cumin, mint, onion, and garlic instead of salt  for the whole family. In fact, a small study on infants and salt intake suggests that  early exposure to salt may help shape babies preference for salty foods , so it wont hurt to keep salt out of her food while shes experiencing all these new flavors.      4. Slow Down      If I give my daughter a piece of food thats too big, she spits it out. If I try to give her a piece of food while shes still chewing, she wont take it. Ditto for a drink. Even if shes eating something she doesnt like  or its too hot or spicy  she wont take a sip of water until shes finished chewing and swallowing. She also likes to stay in her chair and not be rushed.   Now thats just good table manners  that shes teaching me! Ive learned to be more mindful of the food Im eating, chew slowly, and take one bite at a time. A less rushed, more relaxed mealtime wouldnt hurt me either.      5. Done Is Done      When this girl isnt hungry anymore, shes just not hungry. All done! she says. No amount of coaxing or cajoling will convince my stubborn tot to open up that cute little pucker of hers. And why should she? Shes not hungry. End of story.   Wish that my husband and I could learn from her! How many times have we said to each other, Im not really hungry, so why am I eating? How many times have I been grazing on chips or popcorn just because the plate was there?   In the future, I need to channel my daughter, purse my lips and bang my hands on the table and say, All done!"

Preheat oven to 425F. Line one large baking sheet with parchment paper. Prep the spaghetti squash by slicing it in half lengthwise and scraping out theseeds with a spoon. Season the insides with salt and pepper, if desired, and arrange on baking sheet (cut side down). Place baking sheet in the preheated oven for 45 minutes or until spaghetti squash is tenderand shreds easily with a fork. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.  Leave oven on .   2.  While the spaghetti squash is baking, prep the vegetables for the week as follows: One at a time, wash, cut, and set each vegetable aside in separate bowls. Remove the skin from the 3 onions and chopinto small pieces. Remove the stems from the swiss chard leaves; reserve 4 large whole leaves for the Hummus Veggie Wraps and chop 3 cups of chard for the Chickpea Vegetable Soup. Rinse the asparagus, cut off the woody part of thestems (about the bottom two inches), thenchop into 1-inch pieces until you have  cup asparagus. Rinse, remove the seeds,and cut a red bell pepper into  cup of thin slices. Rinse and cut cucumber into  cup of thin slices. Rinse and shred 1 cup cabbage. Peel and finely chop7 cloves of garlic. Remove the ends, rinse, and spiralize 3 cups of zucchini (or, use a vegetable peeler to shave the zucchini into long, thin strips). If you purchased whole mushrooms and carrots, slice the mushrooms and shred the carrots, or slice them into matchsticks.Store any unused vegetables for future use.   3. Pat yourself on the back. That was a lot of vegetables!   4.  Once the vegetables are prepped, make the Spaghetti Squash Lasagna. Usea large spoon or fork to scrape the spaghetti squash from itsskin. Transfer to a clean kitchen towelor colander and gently squeeze the squash to remove any excess moisture. Heat 3 tsp. olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add  cup of the diced onions and  cup of the sliced mushrooms to the skillet; cook until the onion is translucent and mushrooms have softened (about 5 minutes). Add  cup spinach to the skillet, cooking just until spinach has wilted (about 2 minutes). Remove the vegetables from heat and set aside. Open, acan of diced tomatoes and add  cup of the tomatoes to theskillet and stir to combine. In a medium bowl, combine 1 cup ricotta cheese, 3 eggs, and 3 Tbsp. ground flax. Finally, measure and set aside  cup shredded mozzarella cheese. Assemble lasagna in an 8x8 baking dish by layering half of the spaghetti squash, followed by half of the ricotta cheese mixture, half of the vegetable mixture, and half of the mozzarella cheese; repeat layers with the remaining ingredients. Place the baking dish in the 425F preheated oven for 45 minutes or until the cheese is bubbling and begins to turn golden brown. Set aside to cool and turn oven off. Once cool, divide the lasagna into three large storage containers.   4. While the lasagna bakes, make the Chickpea Vegetable Soup. In a large saucepan, heat 3 tsp. olive oil over medium-high heat. Add  cup of the diced onions, 3 cloves of choppedgarlic (approximately 3 tsp.), and 1 cups of the sliced mushrooms to the saucepan; cook until the onion is translucent and mushrooms have softened (about 5 minutes). Next, add  cup of shreddedcarrots to the saucepan and cookfor an additional 5 minutes. Open, drain, and rinse two 15 oz. cans of chickpeas. Add 3 cups of chickpeas, 3 cups of vegetable broth, 3 cups of chopped swiss chard, and 3 tsp. of Italian seasoning to the saucepan. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmerfor an additional 2030 minutes until chard is soft. Set aside to cool, then portion into threestorage containers.   5.  While the soupis simmering, prepare the Zucchini Noodle Stir-Fry. Coat a large skillet with nonstick cooking spray and placeover medium-high heat. Add  cup of the diced onions, 4 cloves of the minced garlic (approximately 4 tsp.), and  cup of the sliced mushrooms to the skillet; cook until the onion is translucent and the mushrooms have softened (about 5 minutes). Next, add 3 cups of spiralized zucchini and 1 cup of shredded cabbage to the skillet; heat for an additional 5 minutes, making sure all ingredients are well combined. Add 4 tsp. sesame oil and stir to combine. Remove from heat and set aside to cool. Once cool, divide the vegetable mixture between 2 large storage containers; top each with 1 or 2 tsp. reduced sodium soy sauce and 1 Tbsp. sesame seeds, then cover and refrigerate.   6.  Prep the Seasonal Omelettes. In a large skillet, heat 3 tsp. coconut oil over medium-high heat. Add  cup of the diced onions,  cup of the sliced mushrooms, and  cup of the chopped asparagus to the skillet; cook until the onion is translucent, and mushrooms and asparagus have softened (about 5 minutes). Next, add  cup spinach to the skillet, cooking just until spinach has wilted (about 2 minutes). Next, prepare three individual omelettes. For each, whisk 2 eggs, seasoning with salt and pepper, if desired, andcook in a small skillet with 1 tsp. coconut oil. Cookeggs over medium-low heat until eggs are set, then place  of the vegetable mixture in center of eggs and fold ends over. Repeat all steps two more times. You may choose instead to make a scramble: Heat 3 tsp. coconut oil over medium heat, add 6 scrambled eggs andall cooked veggies, stirring until eggs are set. Divide between three containers. Serve with a slice of whole-grain toast.   7.  Make the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes by adding  cup ricotta cheese, 6 eggs, 1 cup rolled oats, and 4 tsp. fresh lemon zest to abowl and stirring until batter is smooth. In a large skillet, heat 1 tsp. coconut oil over medium-high heat. Pour or scoop batter into skillet, using approximately  cup of batter for each pancake, and making 3 pancakes per batch. Repeat process of heating more coconut oil and making pancakes until all batter is used. Note: we made 12 pancakes in 4 batches; however, if using a smaller pan, reduce the amount of coconut oil you use per batch. Divide pancakes between 2 storage containers. When ready to eat, top with  banana and drizzle with freshly squeezed lemon juice if desired.   8.  Next, prep the Hummus Veggie Wraps. In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup water to a boil. Add  cup uncooked quinoa, reduce heat to low, and cover for 15 minutes or until quinoa is tender. Set aside to cool.

What to Do After a Binge to Get Back on the Weight-Loss Track
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/weight-loss/what-to-do-after-a-binge-to-get-back-on-the-weight-loss-track,"Heres the not-so-dirty secret: Everybody binges at some point. Think about the last time you declared, Just  one  chip, but finished with an upended bag of salty crumbs on your lips. What about that holiday feast turned food coma? The fact of the matter is it happened, and theres no use pretending it didnt.   What Is a Binge?   A binge is  overeating in a short period of time . You go past satisfying hunger, despite feeling stuffed with food  and oftentimes regret. A binge happens unintentionally, unlike a  cheat meal , which you can plan into a  healthy eating regimen . Binges can occur periodically, as in Thanksgiving dinner, or over a stretch of time like a weeklong cruise to Cancun featuring all-you-can-eat crab legs.   Keep in mind that were talking about a binge, where you overindulge, and not a consistent pattern of binging that may be a sign of a more serious eating issue. To read more information about eating disorders, visit the  National Eating Disorder Association .   Your 5-Step Guide to Beat the Binge (and the Bulge)   Just because we all binge at some point doesnt mean we cant beat the bulge. A binge can be discouraging, especially if youve just started to see progress on the scale. Follow these five steps, so you can get back on track after a binge:   Step 1: Do Emotional Damage Control   Unless youre a special kind of saint,  binging will make you feel lousy . Guilt, shame, worthlessness, and disgust can be knee-jerk reactions post-binge. Catch yourself immediately! You cant change the past or let this binge define you. Here are a few tips to reign in your gloomy thoughts:     Reframe the situation.  This binge session is  not  going to tank your progress.  Your weight is affected by how much you eat  averaged over a long period of time. Think of this binge as a learning opportunity, and use it to course correct for the future. It may be helpful to  jot down your thoughts in a journal  for when you can look back on this moment with a clearer mind, and glean insights from it.   Get your mind off your mood.  Feeling blue? Call up a close friend and plan something fun that doesnt involve food. Now is the time to distract yourself with a hobby you love ( yoga , anyone?). Bonus points if it involves  light exercise .   Dont weigh yourself.  Binging is a hard blow, especially if your self-esteem is tied up in your shape and weight. Its  tempting to weigh that food baby , but do yourself a favor and stay off the scale for now.        Step 2: Pick a Fallback Nutrition Plan     So, you inhaled a large pepperoni pizza, now what? All that excess calories, fat, refined carbs, and salt can make you feel bloated and tired. After dealing with the emotional hurdles of a binge, refocus your effort to get back on the healthy-eating horse. Theres no one answer to how to do this, but here are a few options you can try:     Get back on the healthy habits horse as soon as possible.  Resume an appropriately portioned, balanced diet. Word of caution: Despite tons of calories post pig-out, you may feel hungrier than normal the next morning. This is likely  due to the sugary, high-glycemic index nature of most binge foods , which can spike blood sugar and stimulate hunger.   Focus on fluid and fiber.  If youre like me, youll get a bit queasy thinking about your binge foods. On the flipside, a  fresh salad  or tangy  fruit-and-veggie smoothie  sounds like pure bliss. If this is you, kick off your post-binge meal with plenty of fruits, vegetables, and water. The combination of  fluid and fiber makes digestion more efficient , which helps move your binge food right on through your system. Avoid loading up on calorie-dense, high-fat foods at this point, as  these will slow down digestion .   Try out a non-gimmicky reset.  Depending on the bigness of your binge, you may want to slate about two to three days to recuperate. If you do better with a solid meal plan in place, try the Beachbody  3-Day Refresh  program. You can get back on track while eating nutritious fruits, veggies, and good-for-you fats.        Step 3: Resume Exercise   Obviously, dont hit the pavement running moments after you lay down your post-binge fork. Intense exercise on a full stomach is barf-worthy, so give yourself time to digest. Feeling antsy? Do a brisk walk with your dog or walking up and down the stairs several times. When youre fully digested (think: the next day), you can sweat through a killer workout. The excess glycogen stored from your binge can deliver a burst of energy to fuel your next jog,  CORE DE FORCE  workout, or  HIIT session . The key here is that youre exercising to be a healthier, fitter you,  not  to earn extra calories for food.   Note: If you try a cleanse, you may want to go easy when it comes to exercise intensity, as the cleanse will tax your body (and energy reserves) enough on its own.   Step 4: Think Binge Prevention   Be comfortable with the fact that you may binge again. Then, work on ways you can safeguard yourself from the next binge:     Notice the warning signs.  Instead of reaching for a tray of Oreos, reach deep down inside and  figure out  why  you desire a binge . Oftentimes,  binging is a coping mechanism  for tension or other taxing emotions. If this is the case, brainstorm some non-food ways to deal with your emotions. Also, dont be afraid to get help. A health professional can help you figure out your binge triggers and find better ways to cope.   Dont keep binge foods in the house.  If you know certain foods can trigger a binge, by all means  remove them from your home . You may not have established an appropriate relationship with those foods yet. Once you do so, they can be reintroduced into your home. Again, a health professional can help you figure this step out.   Dont binge on autopilot.  Next time youre mid-binge, take mores pauses to assess the situation. Understand that at any point in your binge you  can  stop. Just because youre satisfying an urge to binge doesnt mean you need to let it play all the way through. Pace yourself and try to enjoy the food.   Loosen up your diet.  For some, eating a restrictive diet (think: calorie-pinching to the point where youre constantly under-eating) for a long period of time can lead to a binge. If this is you, liberalize your diet and allow some of the foods you love back in modest amounts. Beachbodys  Portion-Fix Containers  can help you get a better idea of the right-for-you amounts of different foods to eat. A healthful diet should allow you to enjoy them without guilt.   Practice mindful eating.   Mindful eating  helps you learn the difference between physical hunger and emotional arousal, so you can consciously make the right call to eat. Research shows strong evidence that  mindfulness can reduce the frequency and severity of binges .             The Final Phase of a Post-Eating Binge: Be Kind to Yourself   Losing weight and getting to a healthier you is a journey, so you need to be patient and kind to yourself. Healthy eating for life is more about moderation, balance, and quality, and this is just  one  binge. With time, you will progress and learn more about what will and wont work for your body. Until then, dont beat yourself up!"

Transformation Tuesday: Lisa Lost 39.5 Pounds with 21 Day Fix EXTREME
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/before-and-after-results/transformation-tuesday-lisa-lost-39-5-pounds-with-21-day-fix-extreme,"After having her first child, Lisa H. wanted to become a fit and healthy mom. She began 21 Day Fix EXTREME , and lost 39.5 pounds after 8 rounds! Read on for her story in her own words:   I saw an old friend (who then became my Coach) post about a 21 Day Fix Challenge Group. I had a newborn at home and was so disgusted with myself, I knewthis was my chance to make a change.   I had let myself go after my pregnancy. Iwas a mess postpartum. Pre-pregnancy, I was running and going to the gym. Post-pregnancy,I basically gave up. I was eating whatever I wanted because it seemed to make me feel better. Even when I thoughtI was eating healthy, I soon learned that I wasnt.   My goal was to lose some of the weightI had gained during my pregnancy. I wasnt able to even lift my son out of the bathtub without holding onto something, and even then, it was tough. I wanted to be able to become a fit and healthy mom!   The beginning wastough. I was out of shape and embarrassed at the way I looked! But I started to notice small changes after every weekI was becoming happier.More clothes were starting to fit. I was becoming more confident.I soon needed all new bras and workout pants, as I had to hold them up to workout!   I loved that the workouts are only 30 minutes. It was perfect to do at home, while my son slept soundly in his crib. I didnt have to find a babysitter and drive to a gym, and I kept the baby monitor right next to the TVtalk about extra motivation!   I like the combination of allof the types of workoutscardio, plyometrics, pilates, yoga, upper, lower I had never used a combination of all of these before starting 21 Day Fix EXTREMEand I am so thankful I chose this program to start! I also found it very motivational, and loved that there was a modifier to follow during the very tough times in the beginning!   Ilovedworking out with Autumn! I think I have every motivational quote she uses during the workouts memorized! It was easy to relate to her, being a mom herself. She helped me throw all of my excuses out the window, and let me know that despite what people say about not being able to shape a certain part of your body, (especially after a c-section!), you can do anything with hard work and dedication!   I reached my goal! It was an amazing feeling. I felt like a totally different person than when I began my journey! My goal was to lose all of the weight I had gained and get back to my pre-pregnancy weight, and I surpassed that goal and lost an extra 10 pounds! I celebrated by buying myself my first pair of size 6 jeans, along with an entire new wardrobe! I bought a new weight bench and started buying new pieces for my at-home workout space!   Its a year later and I am stillhearing compliments! People can see how truly happy and confident I am, and that makes me really happy. One of my favorites was when in September when the custodian at my school asked me where I went. I said, Oh, I went to Nashville this summer. He said, Im not talking about vacationIm asking where the other half of you went!'     You can change your life, too.

We gather around the living room for storytelling and around the table to feast. Why not extend the fellowship to the yoga mat?   Kids love yoga since they enjoy playtime and naturally live in the present moment. Sharing just 20 minutes of yoga with the children at your family gatherings is a chance for you to connect and have fun while doing something active, and it doesnt cost you a penny.   Yoga also gives children the opportunity to get creative. While you are teaching the kids the 5 kids yoga poses below, allow them to make up a few on their own and teach you! Sharing yoga to the littles in my family have brought much joy to our holiday gatherings and I hope they will for you, too!   Here are 5 Yoga Poses to Share with the Kids in Your Life:   1. Invisible chair   Children see magic everywhere! Instruct chair pose with, Bend your knees like youre sitting in an invisible chair. Standing with your feet hip width apart, shift your weight back into your heels, and drop your hips knee level. Reach the arms up overhead as you lengthen through the spine, and most importantly keep that heart open and smile!           2. Happiest baby pose   Have the children lie down on their backs and bend their knees with their feet facing the sky. Have them hold the outer edges of their feet and draw the knees down outside the armpits. Kids are usually very limber and this pose can help keep them this way. It opens the hips and releases tension. My niece likes to rock side to side in this pose and give herself a bonus back massage. And rememberwere not just happy babies, were the happiest babies! Dont forget to laugh!       3. Three-legged dog   Let the little ones show off their acrobatic skills by coming into a downward facing dog and reaching one leg up toward the sky. Kids typically enjoy the bent-knee/ hip-opening variation of this pose, and adults can certainly benefit from this stress-relieving variation as well. Just keep the core strong, the low back long and straight, and the chest facing the mat, as you open up the lifted hip and create some space.       4. Cat-Cow poses   My little guys have a cat named Dobby (named after a character in the Harry Potter book series) who does this pose every morning. All humans should do the same as its a great energizing pose to get your day started right. This flowing movement from cat to cow pose is a fantastic stretch for the spine, as we experience both spinal flexion and spinal extension for a greater range of mobility.   For the cat-cow stretch, come to a table-top position by placing your hands on the mat under the shoulders and bend the knees under the hips. For cow pose, drop the belly, lift the chin, pull the chest forward and tilt the tailbone skyward, stretching the core region. For cat, bring your chin to your chest, press into the mat with your hands and lift your upper back toward the ceiling and your belly toward your spine while tilting your tailbone toward your knees. Move from cow to cat poses fluidly with the breath. In these poses, kids love to mooo like a cow, then meow like a cat.       5. Reverse table top   This is a great chest opening and shoulder stretch. For adults, its the perfect counter-pose to all the chaturangas and planks we do in yoga class. For kids, its a great opportunity to bend and stretch themselves into the shape of a familiar piece of household furniture, which is so much fun for them.

",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/before-and-after-results/cize-results-karen-lost-22-6-pounds-in-60-days,"Karen was struggling to lose the baby weight, but nothing seemed to work for her. She heard about  CIZE  being a dance themed program andwas immediately drawn to give it a try. She lost 22.6 pounds after just 60 days! Read about how she did it below:   I was having insecurities with my body after having twokids and not losing any pregnancy weight. It led todepression and relationship issues with my family and friends.I would cry almost every day because Ihated how myweight affected me. I hit my breaking pointand knew it was time for a change! I wanted the old Karen back!   Before having twokids, I was a professional dancer. I thought that the moves in CIZE wouldlet me get back to mydancing roots. I tried every workout before this, but none of them seemed to work and I quickly got bored.  CIZE was the perfect fit from day one.   I loved that the program was aboutdancing. Although I was getting the most out of my workouts, Shaun T made it feel like Iwas in the studio again. Instead of it feeling like a workout, I felt like I was getting ready for mynext show! I started to feel better and better.Each day was challenging, but as I kept going and shedding more and moreweight, my stamina increased.   After completing the program, I am so happy andmore energized. I am excited to go out with my friends, my relationship with my husbandand daughters isbetter because of my positive attitude, andI cant wait to share CIZE  withmygirls when they get older. I hope to inspire others who feel the way I felt and wantmake a change. My journey doesnt end here!

Beachbody Results: Marc Overcame Unhealthy Habits and Lost 38 Pounds!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-marc-overcame-unhealthy-habits-and-lost-38-pounds,"Marc White, age 35, lost 38.2 lbs with  Shakeology , the  Beachbody Performance  supplements,  10-Minute Trainer ,  22 Minute Hard Corps , and  INSANITY MAX:30 . He entered his results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I was a miserable, over weight, lazy truck driver. I worked long hours and was always eating fast food. At my heaviest I weighted 257 pounds. I was unhappy, unhealthy, and hated my life. I hated my body, and how I felt all the time. I always had back pain and never had any energy to play with my kids. I was taking all of my frustration out on my wife and kids (mentally not physically) and there was no need for that. My body was frumpy and flabby. I had boobs and a pot belly. I would never take off my shirt because I didnt want people looking at me. I wouldnt take my kids to the pool or the beach because I didnt want to be judged. My self confidence was shot and I was truly unhappy and unhealthy.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  My wife and two baby boys (Jr who is 2 & John who is 1). They are my inspiration to live a healthier life style and be the best me I can be. I was out of work for 8 weeks with an inguinal hernia. 3  While laying on the couch I had my line in the sand moment. I wanted to be a better father, husband and man. After completing 90 days of the 10-Minute Trainer, I have more confidence to do different programs, but because of my inguinal hernia Im limited to what programs I can do. 3  My doctor said 22 Minute Hard Corps would be a great transition from the time of the trailer, and its only 22 minutes out of my day. When I add Cold-start and Core its still less than an hour. With two baby boys, thats perfect. Now that I have completed INSANITY MAX:30, I am inspired to push myself mentally harder than ever before. This program was great for that.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  The greatest challenges I faced was recovering from this inguinal hernia and trying not to over do it. 3  I was cleared by my doctor but told to listen to my body. I started with the 10-Minute Trainer and moved to 22 Minute Hard Corps. Another challenge is time to work out because of my two baby boys. I overcame this by picking a program that was good on time (less than an hour). I also woke up earlier so I have extra time if needed. The biggest challenge with MAX:30 was the mental aspect. Shaun T push me harder mentally than physically. To do 3 more reps when I am ready to quit was big for me. I have grown from this program and now I am ready to take on any program I put my mind to.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  10-Minute trainer was perfect for me when I was starting out. Having two baby boys, its not easy to get to the gym, or even do a 30-minute workout. 10-Minute Trainer is perfect for anyone with no time. I set my alarm 10 minutes earlier to fit my first workout in. Time management is great with this program. Also, the meal plan is amazing. It is simple to follow and easy to replace what you dont like to eat. I am a picky eater and it worked perfectly. Another plus is I lost weight doing it. The mental workout of INSANITY MAX:30 was by far the best thing from that program. MAX:30 push my mind as well as my body. I never thought I would be able to do 8 weeks, but I did! The mind is so important when it comes to exercising. Form and mind control go hand-in-hand.     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I have achieved so much. My energy and lower back pain are by far the best. I used to have lower back pain, but, since doing the 10-Minute Trainer, I have built up my core muscles and the pain has gone away. My energy is sky high. I am always playing with my boys now, and Im not sluggish or moody. I know thats from proper nutrition. I also have to admit, the weight loss is special too. Im very proud of my arms. 16 1/2 inches is amazing results. Also, I can feel the abs under my belly fat so I know after round two of MAX:30 I will have more defined abs. I really love the Ultimate Performance Stack, and how it made me feel. Since MAX:30 I am able to do jump tucks, which is  big time  for me. I was able to also do 3 more reps when I was ready to quit. I am so proud of these 2 things.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  My life is changed in so many ways. I have made new lifelong friends and I learned so much about myself. I no longer eat fast food, or even have cravings for fast food. I eat healthy, and I will continue to eat healthy using the meal plan for the program I am doing. I am feeling better and better each day about my body. After completing 90 days of the 10-Minute Trainer and 2 rounds of 22 Minute Hard Corps, I was ready to try INSANITY MAX:30. I did do the modified track mostly but towards the end of the program, I was doing no modified moves. I have a long way to go, but I come a long way from where I started. I like my new mindset on a healthy lifestyle. I have more energy to keep up with my kids and when I walk, Im no lover winded. My health has improved, my energy has increased, and my stamina has increased, which are all great benefits. After completing INSANITY MAX:30, Ive noticed I am more confident in myself. I have a feeling that anything I put my mind to I can complete!   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  Its the best thing ever! I have tried a lot of diets and work out programs, but nothing like this one. The Challenge Group held me accountable as well as gave me the support to keep at it. The members never judged me and were all kind and friendly. I made new friends and I feel like we will be life-long friends. Everyday I posted my sweaty pic, my post work out video, and one meal I ate each day. Just those 3 acts had me engaged. It felt like the perfect family.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  I can talk for hours about  Shakeology . I drink Shakeology every day now and I will not miss a day  ever ! Its my daily dense dose of nutrition. I have more energy from drinking it. I think and act clearer. I noticed that its putting the veggies I dont eat into my system. I sleep better at night. I no long feel sluggish. Im always smiling and feeling great. My mood is always pleasant. 2  I have come up with 56 home made recipes including my favorite protein bars. I drink it twice a day and I will continue to drink it for the rest of my life. Its great in the morning when both boys wake up, and I dont have time to cook myself breakfast. Its perfect for lunch time when I dont have time to make lunch. The individual packs are great for travel. I keep a sampler pack in my book bag. Since drinking Shakeology Ive reached my goal weight of under 200. I also started the Ultimate Performance Stack which I would highly recommend to anybody and everybody. Energize gets me going in the morning with no crash. Hydrate keeps me hydrated and has eliminated my headaches. Recover has gotten rid of my soreness after workouts. Creatine has made my arms go to 16 1/2 inches and recharge is amazing. Every time I drink recharge I have the best night sleep. The Recover made a huge difference in the program. It really does work! 2  My digestion system is running smoothly and my doctor said this is the best health hes seen me. 2  This is just the beginning.   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed! Complete any Beachbody program, and enter your results for a free gift and a chance to win cash and prizes. What program are you committing to next?

Healthier Thanksgiving Desserts
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/healthier-thanksgiving-desserts,"Even if your dinner guests have stuffed themselves to the point of food comas on Thanksgiving, theyll always expect to be offered dessert  and probably more than one option for dessert. After a couple hours pass and the turkey haze wears off, people will likely seek a sweet way to end the feeding frenzy. Our roundup of healthier Thanksgiving dessert ideas include all of the spice, pumpkin, and apple flavors familiar to an autumnal buffet, but with more figure-friendly ways to savor them.   21 Day Fix -creator Autumn Calabrese and her brother, chef Bobby Calabrese have put together an incredible menu of Fix-approved Thanksgiving recipes for their new cooking show FIXATE that are healthy versions of your favorites. From Green Bean Casserole and Cranberry Sauce to stuffing and Pumpkin Whoopie Pies, theyve got you covered. Check out FIXATE here !     Pie Recipes   Pumpkin Pie with Whole Wheat Crust     This is the real deal here: a sweet, spiced pumpkin custard with a tender crust that will certainly appease any pumpkin pie devotees. Its not as sweet as store-bought pies, and the crust is far more interesting than a conventional frozen or prefab pie crust made with all-purpose flour. Our version combines whole wheat flour with old-fashioned oats and ground almonds to create a shell thats hearty without being too dense. Get the recipe for  Pumpkin Pie with Whole Wheat Crust .      Pecan and Sweet Potato Pie     This ones for those who waver between the pumpkin or sweet potato and pecan pies at the dessert table and end up getting slice of each because they just cant choose one. Instead of granulated sugar and corn syrup, our version is sweetened with pure maple syrup, dates, and sweet potatoes. A touch of ginger adds a spicy, autumnal note and makes this pie unique. Get the recipe for  Pecan and Sweet Potato Pie .        Banana Honeymoon Shakeology Pie     Banana cream pie, anyone? Even better: Peanut butter and chocolate banana cream pie! We snuck in extra protein with two scoops of Chocolate Shakeology not that anyones counting macros on turkey day, but still. A high-protein dessert for less than 300 calories per slice is called winning. Get the recipe for  Banana Honeymoon Shakeology Pie .      Pumpkin, Pumpkin, and More Pumpkin Recipes   Pumpkin Coconut Custard     This elegant, slightly exotic-tasting number is ideal for more formal dining (read: the adults table) when you plan to serve dessert as the final course. These tender, creamy custards are baked in individual ramekins  perfect because no one will want to share the addictive combination of coconut and pumpkin spice. Get the recipe for  Pumpkin Coconut Custard .      Pumpkin Cookies     These cookies are like handheld crust-free mini pumpkin pies. Created with the familiar flavors of the quintessential Thanksgiving pie, you get pumpkin, cinnamon, ginger, and cloves studded with chopped pecans for extra richness. Get the recipe for  Pumpkin Cookies .      Pumpkin Bread     Paleo pumpkin bread may not sound like the treat your kid brother and uncle will be vying for the last piece of, but this bread simply uses coconut oil instead of vegetable oil or butter, and a mix of almond and coconut flours instead of white flour. You get the same moist pumpkin puree, pumpkin pie spices, and extra cinnamon that youd expect from this seasonal staple. Get the recipe for  Pumpkin Bread .      Peanut Butter (and Pumpkin) Shakeology Cups     So this one seems like it might make more sense for Halloween, but the chocolate-covered peanut butter gets moisture (and a boost of fiber and vitamin A) from pumpkin puree  this also brings it closer to the texture of the peanutty goo thats inside the brand-name peanut butter cups. Get the recipe for  Peanut Butter Shakeology Cups .      Apple Recipes   Apple Crisp     This is the autumn dessert for people who dont like baking. All you have to do is peel and chop apples, mix ingredients together in two bowls, put the spiced apples into a baking dish topped with an oat topping and youre done. Keep an eye on the crisp after its been baking for 25 minutes; once the apples are soft and the oats are browned, its ready to devour. Get the recipe for  Apple Crisp .      Slow Cooker Baked Apples     This recipe could be even easier than the crisp mentioned above, and it has built-in portion control. While most of the other traditional Thanksgiving recipes vie for a spot on the stove or in the oven, this dessert can be prepped in minutes and placed in the slow cooker. You can literally set it and forget it for two hours while it perfumes your kitchen with apples and cinnamon. Get the recipe for  Slow Cooker Baked Apples .      Apple Raisin Cake     Redolent of an apple Dutch baby or a German apple pancake  minus the puffy exterior  this cake is light, tender, and moist. Instead of butter or vegetable oil, it uses small amounts of extra-virgin olive oil and chopped walnuts to give the cake just enough richness and texture. Get the recipe for  Apple Raisin Cake .

4 Common Food Mistakes and How to Avoid Them
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/weight-loss/4-common-food-mistakes-and-how-to-avoid-them,"Youve got two goals on your to-do list: Exercise more and eat healthy. Youre crushing the exercise goal and it wasnt as hard as you thought it would be. Your eat healthy goal, however, has been more of a challenge.   But youre making it work: cooking more at home, packing lunch for work, and cutting sugar out of your coffee. Despite all of that, your fat loss has all but sputtered out. Have you hit the dreaded  plateau ?   Good news: Probably not. Bad news: You  think  youre eating better, but youre probably not.   Find out if youre making these four common food mistakes and how to get on track.        1. Not Watching Your Portions      Avocados are good for you  but not when you put  an entire avocado on your toast .  Eating clean  doesnt mean you have free reign to eat as much as you want; there actually is such a thing as too much of a good thing.   Example:  Hummus  can be a delicious, healthy food, but a serving size is two tablespoons  not half the container you normally enjoy with your baby carrots. Be mindful of  how much youre eating: Use a food scale, measuring spoons, or  portion-control containers  to make sure you arent overdoing it.        2. Not Watching Your Sugar      By now, we all know that  too much sugar in your diet  is not a good thing. The American Heart Association advises  no more than six teaspoons of sugar per day for women and no more than nine for men . The problem is that even if youre cutting sugar from your coffee and kicking your candy habit, youre only addressing the obvious sources.   Sugar (added sugar, not naturally occurring sugar in fruits and vegetables) is in pretty much everything we eat, even foods you wouldnt think contain sugar  bread, sports drinks, salad dressings, granola bars, yogurt, and pasta sauces all contain added sugars.   Sugar also goes by  many different names , so it can be hard to spot on a food label. Look for words that end in  -ose  and ingredients like cane juice, turbinado, dextrin, and malt syrup.   You can still eat sugar as the occasional treat  in moderation. There are times when a little added sugar may benefit you, particularly in a well-designed supplement, such as the way it replenishes glycogen in various  Beachbody Performance products .      3. Drinking Your Fruits and Vegetables      Juicing is an easy way to get your daily fruits and vegetables, but that green juice may not be as healthy as you think it is. Most juicers remove the pulp (or fiber) from the fruit. But the fiber in fruits and vegetables is just as important as the vitamins and minerals in the juice: Fiber  helps you feel more full and slows down the digestion of the fruit and vegetable sugars, so you dont get that blood sugar spike.   Juices also lack fat, and fat can help your body absorb key  vitamins like A, D, E, and K  more easily. A  smoothie  with protein, fiber, and fat is a more balanced option.        4. Ordering a Salad      All salads are healthy, right? Nope. Dont assume that a salad is automatically the healthiest or lowest calorie choice when you eat out. Example: A chicken avocado salad at a popular restaurant chain weighs in at a whopping  1,870 calories . And McDonalds kale salad? Its loaded with  more calories and sodium than a Double Big Mac .   The culprit is usually the dressing, but the high-calorie count can often be tied to serving size (see #1) and additional toppings like cheese, nuts, and candied fruit. Dont be afraid to ask for the extras on the side; that way, you control what to add to your salad. Chain restaurants are required to provide calorie and nutrition information, so read the fine print before your order. Better yet, check the menu online before you go and decide what you want before you get there.   Eating better doesnt have to be hard  the key is to be mindful of what and how much youre eating and youll be well on your way to crushing that eat healthy goal."

Healing Hip Pain With Exercise and Lifestyle Tips
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/healing-hip-pain-with-exercise-and-lifestyle-tips,"I knew something was wrong the day I couldnt get out of my car. My mind said, Stand up but my groin said, Thats not happening.  A sharp pain  radiated from my hip halfway down my leg. This had never happened to me before.       I stretched, whimpered, and waited for the dagger-in-the leg sensation to ease up.      I was convinced Id pulled a groin muscle, but my orthopedic doctor told me that I suffer from osteoarthritis (OA) of the hip. Turns out Im not alone. According to the Center for Disease Control, one in 4 people will develop OA during their lifetime. The disease is so prevalent that, in 2011, there were 512,000 total hip replacements performed, 80 percent of them because of  osteoarthritis.      This is the most active that people have ever been in the history of the earth, says Jay Lieberman, M.D., professor and chair of the Department of Orthopaedic Surgeons at Keck School of Medicine at USC in Los Angeles. So were seeing increases in  hip injuries,  knee pain, really every part of the musculoskeletal system.      Why Does My Hip Hurt So Much After Exercise? ?   To understand the origins of the big ouch, you have to understand the  mechanics of the hip.  Its a ball and socket joint, explains Lieberman. The vast majority of people who develop OA have a structural abnormality in the hip joint.      In laymans terms, this means the ball and the socket just dont fit perfectly, says Lieberman, who also currently serves as president of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons. Around the hip socket is a ring of cartilage called the labrum, which acts like a gasket. The labrum is your friend.      It not only helps to hold the femoral head, which is the ball part, into the hip joint socket  it also keeps the fluids that nourish the cartilage inside the joints, he explains. For people with osteoarthritis, over time the hipbone starts to bang against the labrum ring and eventually you tear it.      Repetitive motions (like elliptical training or pedaling a bike) in some sports may irritate it. This is what happens to countless athletes and active Baby Boomers, such as Yankee star, Alex Rodriquez, who may require a hip replacementat some point.        When to See a Doctor for Chronic Hip Pain   Patients usually complain of pain in the groin or buttocks that usually gets worse with activity, he says. If you have a labrum tear, you may also notice a catching [or a shifting or tugging] sensation in your hip and some stiffness after activity.   Normal every day motions that you never thought twice about become a struggle. As the disease progresses, youll have trouble putting on your shoes and socks, getting in and out of car, and also feel increased pain walking, Lieberman says.   If the hip pain lasts longer than 46 weeks, its time to seek medical attention. He may be a little biased, but Lieberman recommends seeing an orthopedic surgeon, who will do a careful physical exam and X-ray. At the beginning of the disease the X-ray findings are subtle, he says, and somebody whos not trained to look at it could say, That looks pretty normal to me. But there are certain things that you have to look for in the X-ray, or you may have to get an MRI.      How to SupportHip Health and Minimize Hip Pain   Avoid pounding, jumping, running   Depending on what your doctor discovers, he or she may first recommend anti-inflammatory pills and modifying your routines so theres less stress on the hip. If you regularly jog or play football, basketball, soccer, ice hockey, tennis, or baseball, Lieberman suggests picking a different activity so you can get your cardio without continually irritating the hip joint. He doesnt recommend running on concrete or a treadmill either.      Channel your inner Michael Phelps   Liebermans go-to exercise recommendation is  swimming . Its rare for me to hear from a patient that swimming irritated her hip, and the reason for that is if one stroke bothers you, you can try a different stroke, he says. Other hip-friendly activities can include hiking, skiing, surfing, and using the elliptical machine. He doesnt recommend running on concrete or a treadmill at all      Go easy on your yoga and Pilates   Dont start any new exercise after your hip pain kicks in, of course. But if you are already an experienced yogi or Pilates veteran, Lieberman says its fine to continue your practice with modifications so you dont tempt the pain.  Choose poses  and exercises that dont irritate the hip.       Ice, ice it, baby   Theres not enough ice used in the world, laments Lieberman. Professional athletes are completely iced up after they play. They may be in total body ice, or have their arm, elbow, or knee iced. The Arthritis Foundation encourages giving your joints  an ice bath  after any vigorous activity. For the most  effective results,  put an ice pack on your groin and butt. (Seriously.)        Get physical, therapy, that is   If you can swing it, find a trained physical therapist to give you a workout routine specifically designed to stretch and strengthen the muscles around the hip. Its better to have formal physical therapy to make sure youre doing the exercises right, Lieberman says, even if you only go once. Physical therapists will  focus on stretching  your tight outer hips and glutes.   Get a rub down   Especially for osteoarthritis sufferers, Muscles around the hip can get irritated because the mechanics of the hip are off, says Lieberman. Some people say (any kind of) massage helps them feel more comfortable, and it helps with their pain, so Im certainly not against it.   Neither is my hip."

I am a 32 year old wife, mom, and NICU RN, and I have had a lifelong battle with my weight. When I was 10 years old, I was put on a medication that caused me to gain 40lbs and ever since then, I have struggled to get fit until now. I have tried many diets in the past, and I would always gain the weight back and then some. In the past 2 years, I got married, had a baby, and moved!

7 Weird-Looking Fruits and Veggies and How to Eat Them
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/7-weird-looking-fruits-and-veggies-and-how-to-eat-them,"If youve been hanging around the produce section at your grocery store lately, you may have noticed there are more and more downright weird-looking fruits or veggies. Dont worry, its not the zombie apocalypse. Grocery stores are starting to get the memo that shoppers want a wider variety of healthier choices, and even small supermarkets are bringing in more exotic produce.       The good news is that these strange-looking fruits and vegetables dont require a lot of fancy cooking skills. Many can even be swapped in for the produce you eat regularly. We chatted with  Chef Shawn Harrison , whose seasonal creations feature some of the most out-there plants weve ever seen, for tips on how to integrate seven weird-looking fruits and veggies into your weekly meal plan.     1. Black Radish   This charcoal-skinned variety of radishes is quite pungent. They can be eaten raw, but slice them thin because the skin is tough. If theyre too pungent for you, cook them to tone down the flavor.   Nutritional benefits : Like other cruciferous vegetables,  they contain glucosinolates , which can support healthy cholesterol levels and the gallbladder.   How to Eat Them : These are potent, so a little goes a long way. I quick-pickle them: Toss thinly sliced black radishes with rice vinegar, tamari, ginger, a bit of sugar and a pinch of crushed red pepper. Let sit overnight.   Chef Shawn boils them in salted water, then chills, sears in a cast-iron skillet and roasts them. This is a great tip for those who are new to their pungent flavor.   Storing : Refrigerate as you would regular radishes. Discard the green tops if you dont plan to eat them.   Sourcing : A cool-weather crop, theyre available at farmers markets or specialty grocers. Choose radishes that are heavy and firm, with crisp greens. Avoid ones that feel squishy or have blackened stems.     2. Jackfruit   Native to Southeast Asia, these giant fruit have a neutral taste and stringy texture when eaten young. Jackfruit is becoming a favorite meat substitute (seriously) for vegetarians.   Nutritional benefits : This unique fruit  contains  vitamins B6 and C, plus potassium.   Storing : Whole jackfruit should be stored on the counter.   How to Eat Them:  Chef Shawn likes it slow-roasted and pulled with BBQ sauce to mimic pork.   I turn it into avocado chicken salad: Mash an avocado, then add about two cups of (cooked and cooled) jackfruit, minced red onion, raisins and chopped walnuts, plus Dijon mustard, salt, pepper and dried tarragon to taste. Serve in lettuce cups.   Sourcing : Find whole jackfruit as well as canned varieties (packed in brine) at Asian markets, or buy the flesh prepackaged at health-food stores. Jackfruit smells sweet when ripe, so choose those without a scent if youre planning to turn it into a meat substitute. Confession: I almost always buy the prepackaged refrigerated versions because its so much easier!     3. Kohlrabi   These bulbous root vegetables are in the cruciferous family, and they taste a little like broccoli stems, radishes or cabbage. When young, theres no need to peel them, but larger, older kohlrabi has tough skin that should be removed. They can be eaten raw or cooked.   Nutritional benefits :  Kohlrabi  shares the same benefits as other cruciferous vegetables, and it traditionally has been used to support healthy blood sugar levels.   How to Eat Them : Chef Shawn turns kohlrabi into a slaw with oil, vinegar and herbs. (Try it with his jackfruit pulled pork tip above!)   I like to peel and cube kohlrabi, toss it with olive oil and plenty of spices like paprika and cumin, then roast it with sweeter root vegetables like parsnips and sweet potatoes. You can also spiralize it and steam it for a lower-carb pasta swap.   Storing : Refrigerate roots for up to two weeks. Remove leaves if you dont intend to cook them or use them within a few days.   Sourcing : Find them with the other root veggies at your supermarket, usually in summer and fall. Kohlrabi should be heavy and firm, without any brown spots. If the greens are attached, they shouldnt be wilted.     4. Kumquats   Kumquats look like baby oranges, but theyre actually their own variety of citrus. They can be eaten whole, though youll want to discard the seeds. Warning: The peel is sweet and fragrant, while the flesh is sour!   Nutritional benefits : Like the rest of the citrus family,  theyre full of vitamin C , plus dietary fiber.   How to Eat Them : Chef Shawn slices them and adds to salads with a bitter green such as arugula.   I like to dice them and add to a mango or pineapple salsa for additional texture and a sweet-and-sour contrast. You could also add them to guacamole or, on the sweeter side, sprinkle a few slices atop vanilla fro-yo.   Storing : On the countertop as you would oranges.   Sourcing : Find them fresh in winter (citrus season) at grocery stores or preserved as marmalade at gourmet food shops. Like oranges, theyll be fragrant when ripe with firm, blemish-free skin.     5. Persimmons   While the Japanese variety of these sweet fall fruit are more commonly known, theyre also native to the United States. When ripe, their flesh is sweet and pulpy, and they resemble an orange tomato. They can be eaten raw or cooked into a pudding or other sweet treats.   Nutritional benefits : They contain  vitamin C as well as fiber.   How to Eat Them : Chef Shawn eats them raw or sliced in a salad with other fruits. I like that option, but I also like to mix the ripe flesh into chia pudding, oatmeal and smoothies. Dice dried persimmons, and add to oatmeal or trail mix.   Storing:  Let ripen on the counter, then use the flesh immediately or pure and freeze.   Sourcing : Find persimmons fresh in the fall at supermarkets or at Asian markets, where you can also find them dried year-round. You likely wont find them ripe in markets, as they get quite soft. Buy them when firm, and let them ripen on your countertop.     6. Romanesco   This cruciferous veggie looks like an alien version of cauliflower. Its nearly neon green in color, with a mesmerizing fractal pattern. Though it looks too beautiful to eat, you can use it raw or cooked, exactly as you would cauliflower. Instead of slicing it, break it into florets to preserve the beautiful natural clusters.   Nutritional benefits : Similar to  green cauliflower , nutritionally speaking, it contains plenty of vitamins C and K.   How to Eat It : Chef Shawn likes to roast romanesco to get a nice brown color. Roasting sweetens any vegetable, so this preparation can appeal to picky palates.   I often steam it lightly to preserve as much of that gorgeous color as possible, then serve drizzled with pesto or a bright lemony vinaigrette. It also makes a lovely addition to a veggie platter.   Storing : Refrigerate for a few days in the crisper.   Sourcing : Find romesco at farmers markets, or if youve got the space, you can grow it yourself if you live in a region with long, cool summers. Pick heads with tight clusters and no brown spots, and avoid those that feel soft or with greens that are starting to wilt.     7. Sunchokes (Jerusalem artichokes)   These root veggies are actually a variety of sunflowers. Theres no need to peel their knobby skin before boiling or roasting (though you can if you prefer), and their flesh is sweet and nutty when cooked.   Nutritional benefits : Rich in the prebiotic fiber  inulin , which  may support healthy gut bacteria . (Word of warning: Start slow with sunchokes, as inulin is indigestible and  can lead to gas and bloating  if eaten in excess.)   How to Eat It : I am among those who have GI issues with these, so I tend to use them sparingly though I love the flavor. Like kohlrabi, theyre a delicious contrast to other root veggies when pured or roasted. Pure steamed sunchokes and cauliflower with olive oil, lemon zest and a sprinkle of nutmeg for a light yet decadent side dish.   Storing : In a cool, dry place, as you would potatoes.   Sourcing : Find them at farmers markets or with the root veggies at larger supermarkets. When fresh, they should be firm and smooth yet knobby. Pass over those that are soft, dark or wrinkled.  Tip:  Sunchokes are definitely knobby by nature, but choose those with fewer knobs if you plan to peel them."

Beet It: 5 Unique Ways to Eat More of This Healthy Veggie
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/beet-it-5-unique-ways-to-eat-more-of-this-healthy-veggie,"Its undeniable  beets are having a moment. Beets are showing up in juices, smoothies, burgers  (yup), food blogs, and of course, more Instagram posts that you can shake a stick at. These gorgeous veggiescant be beat for beauty, so itd be easy to pin the buzz on their photogenic star-power, but it isnt all about looks. The humble beet has  legit nutritional street cred  and may even have promising results for  athletic performance .   The Benefits of Beets   A  cup of beets  is 60 calories and a good source of fiber, potassium, iron, and folate. This root vegetable is naturally low in fat, cholesterol-free, and low-sodium. And dont toss the greens! Youre basically getting two nutritious veggies for the price of one:  Beet greens  are packed with vitamins A, K, and C. You can prepare and eat them like you would any salad greens.   Do beets improve athletic performance? For some, possibly. A recent review of 19 studies suggest benefits for non-athletes, ranging from 14 to 25 percent improvements in endurance during activities like cycling or rowing. There were mixed results for trained athletes, with some  significant but small benefits , but more studies need to be done. Want to give it a try? The research suggests most benefits are seen with  drinking about two cups of beet juice two to three hours before exercise . You can find beet juice at most grocery stores now, juice bars, or you can make your own at home if youve got a juicer.     Kitchen Tips   Beets, or beetroots, have an earthy, mildly sweet flavor. Commonly a deep garnet red, they can be golden, white, and sometimes a mix in the case of the Chioggia or candy cane beet (a cross section looks like an archery target).     Look for firm, smooth skin, and crisp bright greens.   Smaller ones are generally more tender.   They can be eaten raw or cooked.   Cut greens within an inch of the stem before storing.   Gently rinse before cooking, taking care not to damage the thin skin. Peel after cooking.   To keep the gorgeous red color on your plate and off your shirt, Cheryl Meyer, RD, recommends using surgical gloves during prep.   Bathroom alert: You may see a reddish hue in your toilet for a few days after eating them.     Not ready to commit to a batch of beet burgers just yet? Then try these five unique and delicious ways to add more beets to your life.     1. Pickled Beets   For the tangy bright notes of a pickle and the perks of gut-friendly  probiotics , try fermenting beets at home. If you go for store-bought instead, beware that only those labeled as fermented or with probiotics likely contain probiotics.   2. Roasted Beet Ice Cubes   Roast some beets , puree them, then freeze in ice cube trays. Add four or five beet cubes with one cup pomegranate juice, one cup frozen blueberries, one teaspoon chia seeds, and a drizzle of agave (optional). For another option, Amber Ketchum, M.D.S, R.D. loves adding cinnamon to her beet smoothies to cut through the earthiness.     3. Spiralized Beets   Spiralizing vegetables is almost as trendy as beets. Saut them with garlic and olive oil and garnish with fresh mint and toasted pistachios. Its a great side dish on its own, but its also delicious on goat cheese crostini. Amanda Hernandez, M.A., R.D., offers another great option: Spiralize them raw and marinate with olive oil, vinegar, and black pepper.     4. Beet Dip (Romesco or Hummus)   Use beets in a rustic romesco or hummus recipe for an unexpected take on these traditional dips. Romesco is a classic Spanish sauce similar in texture to pesto thats made with roasted red peppers, tomatoes, almonds and garlic. You can slather this delicious dip/sauce on everything from toast to baby carrots. Just take your favorite romesco recipe and sub in beets for the roasted red peppers. To make a gorgeous beet hummus, just add beets to this easy homemade hummus recipe .     5. Beet Chips   Kim Melton, R.D. says her family likes beet chips with hummus as a healthy snack. Her method: Thinly slice your beets, brush with olive oil, sprinkle with salt, and bake. (Beet chips with beet hummus, anyone?)   When you want to go back to basics, remember that the simplest way to enjoy beets is to roast, slice, and toss them on a salad. A favorite from Amy Gorin, M.S., R.D.N. is greens, beets, avocado slices, and crushed almonds or hazelnuts, with a drizzle of olive oil and balsamic vinegar reduction. Voila  beet heaven."

8 Reasons to Try Flotation Tank Therapy
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/8-reasons-to-try-flotation-tank-therapy,"Lets play a game of Would You Rather:   Would you rather     spend 90 minutes getting a deep-tissue massage   or    spend 90 minutes floating in a soundproof tank of water in the pitch dark?   Before you answer, I fully acknowledge that floating, or float therapy, encompasses pretty much everyones childhood fears: the dark, water, being in the dark in water. But as someone who was (and still is) afraid of those things, I can tell you that floating is just as good as a massage.     What is Floating?   Back in the day, floating took place in sensory deprivation tanks for science experiments, not for relaxation. Research on the effects and benefits of sensory deprivation have been ongoing since the 50s, starting with the work of neuroscientist  John C. Lilly . He created the original sensory deprivation tank and preferred dropping acid before he floated. (Dont do that.)   In the 70s,  Dr. Peter Suedfeld  and  Dr. Roderick Borrie  came up with the less ominous descriptor  Restricted Environmental Stimulation Therapy , or REST. Far from being some hippy-dippy, way-out-there fringe subject, there are  numerous studies on REST  and its effect on hypertension, chronic pain, addictive behaviors, weight loss, and more.   Nowadays, people float for a variety of reasons and its popularity is growing rapidly: The number of float therapy studios in the U.S. has grown from about 50 five years ago to more than 250 studios today, says Jeff Ono, founder of  Pause float studio  in Los Angeles.   What Does Floating Feel Like?   There are two common types of tanks or pods: the clamshell, which looks like a gigantic plastic egg with a hinged top and the walk-in tanks for all you claustrophobic types.   Once youre in the tank, floating in hundreds of pounds of Epsom salts dissolved in hot water creates a trippy, yet soothing experience: The salts keep you bobbing on the surface and body-temperature water helps you lose any sense of being in water. The effect can be disorientating at first, but then you actually feel like youre floating in space.   It took me awhile to truly relax on my very first float; I worried about getting saltwater up my nose, bumping into the walls, being trapped in the tank (none of which happened). But once I got settled, the complete lack of sound, light, and distractions was hypnotic. After awhile, Im pretty sure I fell asleep. While floating in water. Beat that, deep-tissue massage.     Here are 8 reasons to try flotation tank therapy:   1.  Floating  really  is getting away from it all. How many times have you been told how important it is to make time for yourself? Probably a lot. And how many times have you been interrupted by phone calls or texts or doorbells or kids when you try to do just that? On the other hand, its hard for someone to text you or ask you for something if youre floating naked in closed tank of water.   2.  Floating is all about you. Youre in control. You control everything about your float: the lights, no lights, music, no music. If you want to get up and walk around in the middle of your session, you can. If you want to paddle around in circles, you can. Its all you.   3.  Floating is fun. I tend to sink right to the bottom of any body of water that I get into, so the sensation of floating on water is pretty groovy. It can take a few minutes for your body to relax into the water, but once you do, you feel absolutely weightless.   4.  Floating may be physically and  mentally therapeutic . Preliminary studies suggest it may help with a host of issues, from  insomnia  to  headaches . Other studies have shown that float therapy may help reduce  stress-related pain  and  anxiety .   More and more alternative therapies like  cupping  and floating are going mainstream: Elite Olympians and athletes like  gymnast Aly Raisman  and the entire  Golden State Warriors lineup  are fans of floating to recover physically and mentally.   But you dont have to be a professional athlete to reap the benefits. Floating eliminates muscle soreness, reduces my join point and relieves pressure in my head, and headaches vanish, Ono says. As I age, the amount of time I spend hunched over a desk is growing, so I carry a lot of discomfort in my back. Floating releases this tension. It is almost as if my back has been actively stretched during the session.   5.  Floating helps your brain turn off. OK, this one is clearly not a science-backed claim, but I can vouch for the fact I wasnt thinking about  anything  when   I was in the tank. Not about my to-do lists, what to make for dinner, how much those new tires are going to cost  nothing. It was glorious to just  be . (Although, technically, thinking about the fact youre not thinking is, well, thinking, but you get my drift.)   6.  Floating may spark your creative juices. Small studies show that participants displayed more creativity after a REST session. When I come out of the pod and read, I absorb everything. Creatively, it enhances my imagination as well as my memory, Ono says.   7.  Floating will turn your skin as smooth as a babys butt. Again, not scientifically proven, but anecdotally, I can attest to the fact that my skin and hair were silky smooth post-float.   8.  Floating is what you make of it. Thats the beauty of float therapy: Some people float for physical recovery, for a meditative or spiritual experience, but if thats not what youre into, you can float simply to relax and take some time for yourself.   3 Float Mistakes You Do  Not  Want to Make    Dont shave, get a tattoo, or otherwise have unhealed scratches or cuts. Salt water in an open wound = bad.    Dont drink lots of liquids beforehand. (Enough said.)    Do not, I repeat, do  not  rub your eyes once youre in the tank. Seriously. Salt water in your eyeballs is almost, if not more painful, than salt water in an open wound.   Floating may not be for everyone, but in an increasingly plugged-in, turned-on world, its more important than ever to find different ways to give body and your brain a break to recharge.

3 Veggies Meat Lovers Can Get on Board With
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/3-veggies-meat-lovers-can-get-on-board-with,"Youre not alone if you live for the deep, complex flavors of beef, pork, or chicken thats been slowly marinated, seared, or kissed by the flames of the grill.   And guess what? Even if youre trying to get more vegetables in your diet (really, who isnt?) you can still enjoy those same techniques and flavors with plant-based entrees and sides.   Despite what you might have encountered at bad hotel buffets and school cafeterias, veggies dont need to be mushy and bland. In fact, some of the most delicious ways to prepare meat  marinating, searing, and grilling  are also some of the tastiest ways to prepare your favorite veggies, too. Dont put your barbecue in storage just yet. Instead, add these vegetables alongside, or in place of, those cuts of meat.     1. Mushrooms   Mushrooms are basically meat in disguise. The fungi share the savory, earthy flavors and hearty texture of animal protein. All varieties of mushrooms can be prepared almost exactly as meat, and for this reason are frequently used by chefs as stand-ins in meatless versions of Beef Wellington, Stroganoff, burgers, and much more. You can use almost any mushroom variety, but portobello, baby portobello and cremini have the most meat-like texture and flavor.   Bun-sized portobello mushrooms work as a direct substitute for burger patties or chicken breasts. Brush them with olive oil or ghee (clarified butter), then place them right on the grill.   Or, cut mushrooms into bite-sized chunks as you would with pieces of beef, slide them onto a skewer along with bell peppers, onions and tomatoes, and toss them on the grill. You could also marinate them in your favorite sauce as you do with proteins.   Three easy homemade sauces to start with are  chimichurri ,  barbecue , and  orange marinade .     2. Eggplant   This rotund purple veggie is like a great actor waiting for the role of lifetime, and youre just the director to give it to him.   After slicing the eggplant to the desired thickness, brush with olive oil, sprinkle with spices, and set straight on the grill. If steak gets you out of bed in the morning, youll be surprised by just how much you love this steak as it takes on the starring role at dinner. Eggplants hearty texture and the meat-like crispiness of its grilled edges may just win you over.     3. Cauliflower   This cruciferous vegetable finally took over kales spot as the beloved foodie veggie this year and for good reason. Its extremely versatile. Crisp it up by broiling or  roasting in the oven ; pulse it in the food processor to create  rice ; or although the texture isnt an exact match, swap it directly for chicken  these genius  Buffalo Cauliflower Bites  will make you a believer."

7 Tips to Save Money at the Grocery Store
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/7-tips-to-save-money-at-the-grocery-store,"We already know that  cooking at home can help us eat healthier   and even eat less. But can you do itwithout breaking the bank? Absolutely: You  can  save money on grocerieswithout making extreme couponing your new hobby.   Were skipping the obvious ways to cut costs (sign up for coupons from favorite brands and wait for sales we know you got that). Instead, were sharing seven real-life tips and tricks to keep your budget in check while still filling your cart with fresh, nutritious food.      Try These 7 Easy Tips to Save Money      1. Be Flexible   Armed with your list and your meal plan, you head to the market to stock up. Then you see theres no asparagus  and you do a double-take at the price of strawberries. Rather than scrapping your entire plan, pull out your recipe ninja skills.   If you need collards but kale is on sale, make the swap. If chicken breasts are a better deal than turkey cutlets, revise the menu. To change up ingredients without affecting the integrity of a recipe, keep items as similar as possible: No nectarines? Choose peaches. Arugula overpriced? Find a different bitter green. Fresh basil too pricey? Use parsley (or go with dried).   2. Join the Club  A five-pound bag of raw almonds, a double-size container of baby spinach and a three pack of low-carb wraps  youll be able to find the kitchen staples you need for your healthy diet, be it Paleo, vegan, or anything in between.   Tip:  Split the membership fee with a friend. Since the official member needs to be present, youll get BFF time while you grocery shop just skip the samples.     3.Go Price Shopping   No club nearby? No problem. Amazon Prime, Thrive Market, and Vitacost are among the sites offering good deals on groceries  including kid-friendly fare. (Thrive and Amazon also have apps, so you can compare prices while at the grocery store.)   Bonus:  Buying some of yourgroceries online could help you eat better. According to research,  ordering food ahead of time  may lead to healthier food choices and fewer splurges. Talk about a sound endorsement for meal planning!   4. Ignore the Labels   Dont overlook the nutrition facts. Instead, ignore the  front  of the label, says Kristen Arnold, R.D.N., L.D., M.S. The only difference is the taste, and a lot of times the store brands taste better than the name brands, says Arnold, whos also a professional cyclist.  Youll save an average of 25 percent  and store brands were deemed as delicious as the name brands more than half the time.   Splurge on any product where the specific seasonings and ingredients matter  like salsa or premium ice cream  but save on staples like diced tomatoes, low-sodium broth, and Greek yogurt.   5. Do the Math   The larger container is usually  but not always  the best deal. Read shelf tags to see which option has the lowest cost per ounce or pound. This will help you decide whether the 12-ounce jar on sale for $4.99 or the 16-ounce jar for $6.99 is a better deal. Another tricky move? Those 10 for 10 sales. Peek at the other items in that category (and the non-sale price) to see whether youre  really  saving.     6. Shop the Bulk Aisle   Mainstream supermarkets now offer everything from flour and sugar to tamari-roasted almonds and candied ginger in bulk bins. Youre not paying for fancy packaging or marketing, so the prices are lower  and you can take only what you need. Arnold relies on bulk items to keep her food bills low, and beyond the bins, she loads up on bags of sweet potatoes and apples  its cheaper than buying them loose.   Tip:  Get kids excited about healthier snacks by letting them scoop ingredients for their very own trail mix.   7. Carry a Basket   If you just need a few items, dont tempt yourself with extra space. As you fill your basket, youll feel the weight of each item you add to it, which could make you think twice about picking up a half-gallon of ice cream or anything else thats not on your list."

9 Genius Slow Cooker Tips for Easy Meal Prep
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/9-genius-slow-cooker-tips-for-easy-meal-prep,"The allure of easy, healthy slow cooker recipes is undeniable. Who doesnt enjoy a delicious meal that takes minimal effort to create  not to mention one that works miracles on the toughest (and most affordable) cuts of meat?   To help you make the most of this all-star appliance, weve rounded up nine stellar slow cooker ideas. Use them for meal prep or just for the next time you need to bring a big batch of something to an event. Either way these tips will help you cut down your time in the kitchen.     1. Make a mass of protein to use all week long   One of the simplest, smartest ways to streamline your weekly meal prep is by slow-cooking a large batch of one protein on the weekend, and then adding it in to multiple dishes throughout the week. Shredded chicken is extremely versatile; try it in  salads ,  sandwiches ,  rice bowls , tacos, and burritos. Pulled pork and  meatballs  are also flexible options.     2. Meal prep like a boss   Find a slew of slow cooker recipes and spend a weekend afternoon chopping and assembling the ingredients into labeled, freezer-friendly bags. The night before you cook, move the bags into the fridge so they can thaw. Youll save time by prepping en masse, and youll also cut costs by purchasing items, such as meat, in larger, value-priced packages.     3. Batch cook your breakfasts   Dinner isnt the only meal magically transformed by slow cookers. Wake up from dreamland to a piping hot breakfast with overnight slow cooker dishes such as steel-cut oatmeal, savory frittatas, farro and quinoa bowls, and casseroles. The cook-while-you-snooze strategy is also perfect for hearty weekend lunches. If youre freaked about leaving an appliance turned on while you sleep or are gone during the day, check out the last tip about smart tech.   In addition to one-off breakfasts, you can slow-cook a whole weeks worth of breakfasts in one go with a large batch of oatmeal (such as this  Slow Cooked Steel-Cut Oatmeal with Apples and Cinnamon ). Store it for several days in the refrigerator, or freeze individual portions.     4. Simmer in your slow cooker instead of on the stove   Dried beans, pasta sauces, chicken stock, granola all these staples can be slow-cooked in large batches to help you throw together meals easily. Try this  Slow Cooker Refried Beans  recipe, which can be frozen for up to three months.     5. Make a double batch to enjoy now and later   From hearty stews to your favorite  chili , some slow cooker recipes taste just as good, if not better, as leftovers. With a large slow cooker its easy to make extra and get two meals for the work of one. Cant stand a repeat dinner in a single week? Just choose freezer-friendly recipes and stash half to enjoy in a few weeks.     6. Treat your oven to some time off   Tackling a bunch of recipes at once for a big dinner or holiday feast? Solve the traffic jam for the oven and stove by delegating a side dish to the slow cooker, such as baked and mashed potatoes, stuffed peppers, sauces, and even fruit crisps and baked apple desserts.     7. Hack the shredding step   Instead of the typical method of pulling apart cooked chicken and pork with forks, fast-forward the process in seconds with a potato masher or hand mixer. Dunk the masher or mixer right into the pot to shred the meat, then let it laze in the saucy pool before being spooned onto plates.     8. Eliminate tedious pot scrubbing   You can skip post-meal soaking and scrubbing by using  slow-cooker liners , many of which are BPA-free. Use them once and toss for quick cleanup.     9. Go high-tech   To avoid having to babysit your slow cooker or rush home from work, invest in one with a digital timer that automatically switches to the warm setting once the cooking time is up. Even fancier: some models are WiFi-enabled and can be controlled with your phone. Now if only they could make one that chops all the vegetables too"

Dry shampoos come in both aerosol and powder form and leave zero trace.   Here are my top dry shampoo picks to keep your coif looking and smelling fresh.     1. Suave  Keratin Infusion Dry Shampoo   $4.99 (4.3 oz.)   Suave makes one of the best inexpensive dry shampoos on the market. Keratin is a protein found in your hair (and nails and skin) that protects it from damage from heat styling and chemical treatments . The keratin in this particular dry shampoo can also help your hair look shinier and smoother  and who doesnt want that?!     2. Not Your Mothers  Clean Freak Dry Shampoo  $6 (7 oz.)   This is another great basic dry shampoo if youre a gal who doesnt want to spend too much money. It doesnt do much else besides freshen up your roots, but for the price, its really all you need. A great clean scent with super absorption, this product hits the mark.     3. Batiste  Dry Shampoo   $7.99 (6.73 oz.)   This dry shampoo can hang with the most luxe dry shampoos on the market. Batiste is one of my personal favorites for three reasons. 1. It comes in a wide array of fragrances, from floral to fresh and powdery. 2. It comes in various color formulas for women who want to touch up their roots in between salon visits. 3. Its an unbelievable price for what you get. Depending on where you buy it, the price ranges from $5.99 to $8.99.     4. Bumble and Bumble  Pret-a-Powder  $12 (.3 oz), $24 (2 oz)   Bumble and Bumble is well-known for its styling products, but this is definitely one of the lines shining stars. This fantastic powder is super absorbing and also pumps up the volume. Its great for all hair types, but especially good for women with thin hair who are looking for that extra oomph.     5. Captain Blankenship  Mermaid Dry Shampoo  $14 (2.4 oz.), $24 (4.8 oz.)   If youre an all-natural kind of woman, youll love this one. Captain Blankenships line is made from organic plant and mineral materials. Bonus? Its scented with rose and geranium essential oils.     6. Kardashian Beauty  Take 2 Dry Shampoo   $14.99 (5.3 oz.)   Before you start hating, I have to say I was honestly impressed by this dry shampoo. The magic sauce is black seed oil derived from the  Nigella sativa  plant ,  which has a rich history as a  folk remedy for a wide array of ailments , though the jury is still out on what it actually does for your hair. Either way, as a dry shampoo, its well-priced for how it performs: It smells intoxicating, absorbs excess oil, and doesnt weight your hair down. Done and done.     7. Drybar  Triple Sec 3-in-1  $26 (4.2 oz) $13 (1.6 oz.)   The tagline for this product is texturize, amplify, refresh    and they arent kidding. Its everything the name promises and is worth the price. The smell is amazing  a yummy vanilla-like scent  and exactly what you want to spray on your hair to give it a lift after work before heading out to happy hour (or a date!). The travel-sized option is perfect for your purse or desk.     8. Oribe  Dry Texturizing Spray  $44 (8.5 oz.), $22 (purse size)   Oribe is one of the most luxurious haircare brands on the market. Their products are not kind on the wallet, but theyre definitely kind on your tresses, and boy, do they smell good. Theyve even created two different perfumes from the scents they use in their haircare line: Cote dAzure with notes of lemon, bergamot, and orange and Silver Pearl, which blends mint, water lily, green fig, and bamboo.   The Dry Texturizing Spray isnt technically a dry shampoo, but the award-winning spray is a cult classic and is widely used in the beauty community. It can be used as an alternative to classic dry shampoos, and doesnt leave any powdery white residue. It also adds fantastic volume and creates a tousled texture. Spray it all over your hair, not just the roots, to vamp up your look."

Skinny Buffalo Chicken Dip
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/skinny-buffalo-chicken-dip-recipe,"Buffalo wings: two words that scream cheat meal. Each tiny wing, fried and smothered in buttery hot sauce, can have about 165 calories. Order them in a restaurant, and youll get a dozen or more of those calorie bombs, usually served with a creamy dip oh, and a smattering of celery sticks that do nothing to redeem the healthiness of the meal  or appetizer for some. One could make a wishful case that the effort of stripping the small amount of meat from the bones burns calories, but that kind of argument is doomed to disappoint.   But they taste  so  good; what is a lover of Buffalo wings to do?   Under unlikely circumstances, I had an idea to make Buffalo wings and their accompanying dip so lean and clean that it might even pass for a healthy snack.   A friend brought a casserole dish filled with her moms famous Cheesy Buffalo Wings Dip to a potluck. It was a deliciously addictive abomination that was much  faster  easier to  shovel into my face  eat since the meat and dip were already combined in a heavenly vat of bad-for-you. But after a few  dozen  bites, I realized that the dip could be easily revamped to remove most of the fat and calories without diminishing the flavor. I scooped up a few more bites to make sure.   This skinny Buffalo Chicken Dip is the result of that junk food binge (you might say I took one for the team). Shredded chicken breasts replace the fattier dark meat, and a combination of Neufchatel (look for it next to the cream cheese in the grocery store) and Greek yogurt give it the creaminess of a dip. We added part-skim Mozzarella to make this cheesy like my friends dip, but you could substitute part or all of that for more Greek yogurt to make yours even leaner. Tangy hot sauce and a little bit of crumbled blue cheese create the familiar flavor of Buffalo chicken. Combine everything and bake until bubbling; serve hot with raw veggies like celery sticks, baby carrots, cherry tomatoes, or cucumber slices, and enjoy!   Tip:  Put this Skinny Buffalo Chicken Dip together quickly using leftover  baked chicken breasts  or rotisserie chicken that has been shredded with a fork.     Skinny Buffalo Chicken Dip   Total Time:  0 min.   Prep Time:  10 min.   Cooking Time:  30 min.   Yield:  8 servings, about  cup dip and  cup veggies each   Ingredients:  2 oz. Neufchatel cheese, softened  1 cups reduced fat (2%) plain Greek yogurt   cup shredded part-skim Mozzarella cheese   cup cayenne pepper hot sauce   cup crumbled blue cheese  1 cups shredded cooked chicken  Nonstick cooking spray  4 cupsvraw vegetables (like celery sticks, carrots sticks, jicama sticks, cherry tomatoes, and cucumber slices)    Preparation:  1. Preheat oven to 350 F.  2. Combine Neufchatel cheese, yogurt, mozzarella cheese, hot sauce, blue cheese, and chicken in a medium bowl; mix well.  3. Place in a 1-quart baking dish that is lightly coated with spray. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until cheese is melted and edges begin to slightly brown.  4. Serve immediately with raw vegetables for dipping.     If you have questions about the portions, please  click here  to post a question in our forums so our experts can help.

9 Healthier Breakfast Recipe Makeovers Under 350 Calories
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/9-healthier-breakfast-recipe-makeovers-under-350-calories,"Out of the three squares a day, breakfast  especially weekday breakfast  gets the shaft. We often neglect it, abandon it, or grab the nearest bar/baked good/fill in the blank with whatever packaged food is within reach. We get it; we do it, too.   Advanced meal prep can help solve the what-healthy-thing-to-eat dilemma at all times of the day, but it can be particularly useful for the first meal of the day, which is often a last-minute scramble. If you take some time to plan on the weekend, you can have more healthful and generally lower calorie versions of the fallback foods you love for breakfast available just as conveniently as those store-bought or drive-thru foods.   Need more convincing? Look at all of the tastiness you can get for less than 350 calories:        Breakfast Quesadillas   For those mornings when you worked out so hard you can almost feel yourself wasting away, or you had one too many the night before and the drive-thru seems like the only way to make peace with your angry stomach and throbbing head, or fluffy eggs and oozing cheese are the sunshine you need to tumble out of bed, these breakfast quesadillas are about to become your new BFF. These crisp, warm, melty pockets of fast-breaking joy can be macgyvered to suit any palate, and can be made in advance and reheated for busy weekdays.   What youll need:     2 tsp. olive oil   1 medium onion, chopped   1 medium red (or orange) bell pepper, chopped   2 medium jalapeos, seeds and veins removed, finely chopped (optional)   3 large eggs, lightly beaten   4 large egg whites ( cup)   4 (8-inch) whole wheat tortillas   1/2 cup shredded cheddar cheese     Find out how to  make the recipe .   Calories per serving:  301          Mozzarella and Egg Breakfast Sandwich   If you want more handheld scrambled egg goodness, our veggie-spiked take on that popular drive-thru breakfast classic involving English muffins gets a meat-free makeover. We trim the saturated fat by using part-skim mozzarella and one whole egg plus two egg whites. We amp up the flavor with roasted red bell peppers and fresh basil for a Mediterranean spin on the egg sandwich, but feel free to add whatever floats your boat.   What youll need:     1 large egg   2 large egg whites   1 Tbsp. low-fat milk   Nonstick cooking spray   2 Tbsp. chopped roasted red bell pepper   2 Tbsp. chopped fresh basil   Ground black pepper (to taste; optional)   1 slice part-skim mozzarella cheese ( oz)   1 whole wheat English muffin, split, toasted     Find out how to  make the recipe .   Calories per serving:  316          Spinach and Broccoli Strata   Three words for you: Bread, eggs, cheese. Make that melted cheese. Who doesnt want that for breakfast? Strata, a casserole made usually with day-old bread and a cheese-spiked milk-and-egg mixture, can not only be a life-saver brunch idea (Have you ever invited friends or family over for brunch only to be trapped in the kitchen, flipping omelets?) but also a life-saver make-ahead meal idea. Bake off a dish of this Spinach and Broccoli Strata and you can have breakfast for the entire work week (plus extras!).   What youll need:     Hot water   4 cups broccoli florets   4 tsp. olive oil   1 medium onion, chopped   2 cloves garlic, finely chopped   8 large eggs, lightly beaten   2 cups reduced-fat (2%) milk   2 cups raw spinach, chopped   1/2 tsp. sea salt (or Himalayan salt)   1/2 tsp. ground black pepper   Nonstick cooking spray   8 slices low-sodium sprouted whole grain bread, cut into 1-inch cubes   1/4 cup crumbled feta cheese (about 1 1/2 oz.)     Find out how to  make the recipe .   Calories per serving:  233          Chocolate Peppermint Muffins   Some of you might be thinking: Enough of the savory already. Wheres the sweet? We hear you. And these Chocolate Peppermint Muffins are gonna rock your world. Sweet, refreshing mint and rich cocoa flavor aside, these moist and crumbly handhelds contain just 133 calories per muffin. You read that right. This means you can have two for breakfast and still be under 300 calories total. For those with an aversion to gluten, there isnt even a pinch of flour in these; we use chickpeas for structure.   What youll need:     1 (15-oz.) can chickpeas (garbanzo beans), drained, rinsed   3 large eggs   1/2 cup raw honey   1/3 cup unsweetened cocoa powder   1 tsp. baking soda   3 Tbsp. coconut oil, melted   1/2 tsp. pure peppermint extract     Find out how to  make the recipe .   Calories per serving:  133          Blueberry Maple Muffins   Chocolate not your thing? Its hard for anyone to resist a warm blueberry muffin  that tender, yielding crumb, that tart and sweet burst of berry, that whisper of vanilla and sugar that lingers. But, as muffins (and, well, all food portions) get bigger and bigger, all of those comforting refined carb calories can stack up quickly. Our remake keeps everything we all love: fresh blueberries, sweetness (from maple syrup), and richness (from coconut oil), and combines it with healthier ingredients, such as whole-wheat flour, wheat germ, and low-fat buttermilk.   What youll need:     Nonstick cooking spray (optional)   1 cup whole wheat flour   3/4 cup + 2 Tbsp. all-purpose flour   1/4 cup wheat germ   1 1/2 tsp. baking powder   1/2 tsp. baking soda   1/4 tsp. fine sea salt   1 tsp. ground cinnamon   2 large eggs   1/2 cup pure maple syrup   1 cup low-fat buttermilk   1/4 cup coconut oil, melted   1 tsp. vanilla extract   1 1/2 cups fresh blueberries     Find out how to  make the recipe .   Calories per serving:  156          Gluten-Free Banana Bread   This aint your grandmas banana bread. Props to granny  her bread is perfectly delicious, moist, and comfortingly sweet, but all those refined carbs and not much protein or fiber to help redeem it. Our more modern take on this old-fashioned staple makes it safe for gluten-intolerant and gluten-sensitive folks, and is great for those watching their cholesterol. This doesnt mean its not tasty. Were not the types to offer you a banana-flavored piece of rubber (Have you ever tried an oil-free quick bread? Doesnt it remind you of rubber?). Our banana bread recipe walks the line between rich (we swapped butter for coconut oil) and healthy (5 grams of fiber and 6 grams of protein per serving), and it hits all of the flavor notes  banana, vanilla, warm cinnamon spice  you expect.   What youll need:     1 1/4 cups almond flour   1 1/4 cups gluten-free all-purpose flour   1 1/4 cups old-fashioned rolled oats, gluten-free   1/2 tsp. sea salt (or Himalayan salt)   2 tsp. baking soda   3/4 tsp. baking powder   1/2 tsp. ground cinnamon   6 large ripe bananas, mashed   1 tsp. pure vanilla extract   1 large egg, lightly beaten   3 Tbsp. extra-virgin organic coconut oil, melted   1/2 cup pure maple syrup   1/4 cup unsweetened almond milk   Nonstick cooking spray     Find out how to  make the recipe .   Calories per serving:  274          Mocha Caramel Latte Shakeology   Cant stomach much early in the morning except for that mandatory coffee? We have just the thing for you. This Mocha Caramel Latte Shakeology recipe has all of the sweet caramel and chocolate flavor of a frosty dessert beverage. But, instead of being loaded with sugar syrup and cream, its a healthy snack that wont bust your diet. The secret that makes this recipe taste as good as the original: the caramel extract. Real caramel is made by melting butter, cream, and sugar three ingredients that anyone with fitness and nutrition goals should generally avoid. But caramel extract provides the same buttery, burnt-sugar flavor without any of the guilt. Its a game changer for your sweet tooth.   What youll need:     1 cup unsweetened chocolate almond milk   1 scoop Caf Latte Shakeology   1 tsp. pure caramel extract   1 cup ice     Find out how to  make the recipe .   Calories per serving:  207          Cinnamon Raisin Granola   If you love cereal and have since you were a kid, theres no reason to give it up. Just try making your own at home so you can control the quality of the ingredients. While our version takes some time to bake, the ingredients are easy to assemble. Youll need to babysit the oats while they toast in the oven (stirring every 15 minutes so they dont burn), but this is the perfect recipe to make while youre meal prepping for the week, doing chores around the house, or helping the kids with their homework.   What youll need:     Nonstick cooking spray   3 cups old-fashioned rolled oats   2 cups rolled wheat flakes (or barley flakes)   1/4 cup unsweetened frozen apple juice concentrate, thawed   2 Tbsp. pure maple syrup   1 Tbsp. ground cinnamon   1/2 cup raisins   1 cup slivered raw almonds (or chopped walnuts or chopped pecans)     Find out how to  make the recipe .   Calories per serving:  180          Cranberry Granola Bars   This ones for those who love granola, but dont have the extra time to sit and enjoy a bowl of cereal in the morning.

Yes! Eighty-seven calories.   What youll need:     1 cup low-fat granola   1 cup old-fashioned rolled oats   1/2 cup whole wheat flour   1 tsp. ground cinnamon   1 large egg, beaten   1 cup unsweetened applesauce   1/4 cup raw honey   1/2 cup dried cranberries   1/2 cup chopped walnuts     Find out how to  make the recipe .

THE 20s Trainer Spotlight: Meet Ericka!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/the-20s-ericka,"THE 20s  has kicked off and well be spotlighting one trainer a week here on the Blog. Theyll also be taking over the  Beachbody Facebook  and  Instagram  channels, so make sure to tune into both!   Meet Ericka. Shes a 56 26-year-old trainer who grew up in Princeton, New Jersey and used to dance for the Brooklyn Nets. She now lives in Los Angeles and is ready to get you  and your booty  in shape with her dance/barre workouts! Watch new episodes of THE 20s on  Beachbody On Demand  every Monday to support #TeamEricka!     How did you get into fitness?  My mom put me in dance when I was three, so that kind of started that whole thing. I went to college at the University of the Arts for dance. Ballet, modern, jazz I did everything, but my favorite is hip hop. I danced professionally for the Brooklyn Nets for two years out of college until I moved out to LA.      What brought you to LA?  I remember the moment I realized I needed to move to LA. I would commute to New York from New Jersey every day and I was waiting for the train. It was pouring rain. I was freezing and I had my suitcase with all my costumes and I was like, its time. I need some sun.      Did anything change when you got here?  It wasnt really until I moved out to LA that I fell into fitness. My roommate was the only girl I knew here and she taught cardio barre. I hadnt heard of it before, but I fell into that and fell in love.     I did it once before. Those little baby weights are misleading!  I know! People are like three pounds is not bad. Im like,  just wait .  Youll be with those three pounds for a while.  Its very different. Its cardio and toning but youre using different muscles. And its a lot of stretching, which people tend to stay away from.      In terms of nutrition, did you grow up eating pretty healthy?  I did not. I would come home from school and go through chips, macaroni and cheese, etc. It wasnt until my mom had a heart attack at 39  shes ok  but four stents later we took everything out of the fridge and replaced it with delicious, whole, healthy foods. It was definitely an adjustment but it was a wake-up call and we did it together. At that point I realized what you put into your body is about more than looking good. Its about feeling good and being healthy from the inside out.     What sort of nutrition plan do you follow now?  I eat about six small meals a day and Im a vegetarian.      What are some of your favorite vegetarian proteins?  I love lentils, Greek yogurt, and eggs.      Do you drink  Shakeology ?  I do! I love Chocolate. It tastes like brownie mix to me. I like throwing in a banana and maybe a scoop of peanut butter and its the perfect shake.      Before we go, tell us: whats your favorite workout move?  Probably leg lifts at the bar. I love working the booty and its definitely a great burn.      What other moves do you recommend to work the booty?  I like using your own body weight. I do barre squats and leg lifts, leg lifts even on the floor. Leg lifts for days, pretty much. You dont need to squat to get a big booty. It helps, though.

It was totally worth it.   But, in the back of my mind, a little voice chidedme that bylunchtime on Monday, Id regret skipping my meal prep, and probably hit a tacotruck.

I made a quick trip to the grocery store for supplies once the sun had set, which is a much less crowdedtime to shop as it turns out! The next morning (yes, Monday morning  before  work), I slapped together this meal prep in record time.   Since no cooking was required, most of the meals are meant to be served cold.

If you did not buy cooked brown rice, start by steaming the rice. Combine 2/3 cup brown rice and 11/3 cup water in medium saucepan, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to maintain a gentle boil; cook, covered, for 1520 minutes. Remove pan from heat and let rice rest, covered, for 10 minutes. Do not remove lid. Open lid and fluff rice with a fork; let cool completely. Set aside.   2.  If you did not buy hard-boiled eggs, place six eggs in a saucepan, and add enough water to cover the eggs by one inch. Bring water just to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 12 minutes. While eggs cook, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Carefully remove the eggs from the hot water with a slotted spoon and transfer to the ice water. Place in refrigerator. Serve two hard-boiled eggs with an apple and 2 tsp. of nut butter.   3.  Make the Coconut Mango Chia Pudding (we adjusted the recipe to make three servings). Remove the lids from three mason jars. In each, place 1/8 cup chia seeds,  cup coconut milk beverage, and  tsp. raw honey; stir to blend. Top each jar with 1 cup chopped mango. Seal jars and place in refrigerator.   4.  Next, make the Overnight Oats. Remove the lids from two mason jars. In each, place  cup old fashioned rolled oats,  cup unsweetened almond milk, and 1 Tbsp. hemp seeds (or sunflower seeds); stir to blend. Top each jar with 1 cup chopped strawberries. Seal jars and place in refrigerator.   5.  Pre-portioned smoothie bags make it even faster to make your  Shakeology  smoothie. Fill three plastic bags or other containers each with 1 cup baby spinach and 1 cup frozen blueberries. Place in freezer. Fill two plastic bags or other containers each with 1 cup frozen peaches. Place in freezer.   6.  Make the Greek Chicken Salads. Place 1 cup chopped romaine lettuce into each of two food containers. Top with  cup chopped cucumber,  cup cherry tomatoes, 5 kalamata olives, and 1 oz. crumbled feta cheese. If you bought rotisserie chicken, cut the breast meat away from the bone and remove the skin. Slice each chicken breast and place 3 oz. of meat in each food container. Cut a lemon in half and place one wedge in each container; use it to dress the salad when youre ready to eat. Place salads in refrigerator.   7.  To make the White Bean and Tuna Salads, fill three food storage containers each with 1 cup spinach,  cup chopped red bell pepper,  cup chopped cucumber, 1 sliced green onion, and parsley to taste. Place in refrigerator. When ready to eat, open and drain one can of tuna; add tuna to the salad. Dress with 2 tsp. olive oil and 2 tsp. balsamic vinegar just before serving.   8.  Divide 1 cups low-fat Greek yogurt between two small food containers. Top each with 1 cup fresh berries. Place in refrigerator.   9.  In a large bowl, combine  cup chopped orange pepper,  cup chopped yellow bell pepper, 1  cups cherry tomatoes,  cup brown rice,  cup canned black beans (drained and rinsed),  cup shredded cheddar cheese, and  cup cilantro (optional). Mix well. Divide evenly between three food storage containers. Place in refrigerator.   10.  Divide 18 oz. low-fat cottage cheese between three food storage containers. Top each with  tsp. smoked paprika (or chili powder) and 1 Tbsp. raw pepitas. Place in refrigerator. Serve with black beans and rice.   11.  Last, make the Shrimp and Veggie Rice Bowls.

6 Easy, Healthy Snack Picks for Kids
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/6-easy-healthy-snack-picks-for-kids,"Lets face it kids can have some pretty inconsistent eating habits. There are days when all they do is pick at their food, and sometimes they just skip meals altogether. Thats where healthy snacks can come in. They can be used to sneak essential nutrients into the diets of growing kids, and can be an energy boost to help children get through their active days.   Think of snack time as a mini-meal. Serve whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains instead of processed options that can be loaded with sugar, salt, and saturated fats. Need some inspiration? We think your little ones will love these sweet and savory picks.      Greek Yogurt   Avoid sugary yogurt snacks and choose plain Greek yogurt as a healthier option. Four ounces makes for a light snack, delivers over 10 grams of protein, as well as  calcium and vitamin D , which kids need to build  strong and healthy bones .   You can also add your own fresh fruit and spices, like apples and cinnamon, to amp up flavor without adding sugar.  Stonyfield Organic  has a great whole-milk variety for little ones and a non-fat version for everyone else in your family.      Veggies and Hummus   If you havent tried hummus, youre missing out on a creamy snack that can be served in a variety of ways. Made from chickpeas, this nutrient-rich dip is a good source of complex carbs and is  low on the glycemic index  like other legumes.   Dish out two tablespoons of hummus ( Sabra Classic Hummus  is a favorite), and serve with veggies like baby carrots and bell pepper slices for a quick and easy kid-sized snack. For something more substantial, hummus also works as a tasty spread on sandwiches. Heres a recipe to make your own  homemade hummus  in less than five minutes.      Whole Wheat Crackers or Fruits and Veggies with All-Natural Nut Butter   The combination of peanut butter and crackers is timeless, but it might be time for a makeover. Move away from nut butter brands that contain hydrogenated oil, and opt for all-natural peanut butter or almond butter like  Justins  Classic Almond Butter which has no added salt or sugar.   You also may want to try sunflower butter. A two tablespoon serving of  SunButter  has the same amount of protein as peanut butter, but contains more Vitamin E, and has four grams of fiber.   Instead of processed, salty crackers like saltines, opt for apples, celery, or whole-grain crackers.  Crunchmaster  7 Ancient Grains crackers are a good choice, as theyre made from wholesome ingredients like brown rice flour and millet.      Beef Jerky   Forget the gas station meat sticks that you may have gnawed on as a kid and embrace quality brands like  Brooklyn Biltong  or  Nicks Traditional Beef Jerky . This mess-free snack is easy to take on-the-go and can be a great way to sneak more protein in your little ones diet. For younger kids, break the jerky up into smaller pieces that are easier for them to chew.   Just make sure you pay attention to the sodium content. The  sodium recommendation  for children ages one to three years old is 1,000 mg a day, four to eight years old is 1,200 mg a day, and kids ages nine and older is 1,500 mg a day. If you want to give your child a high-protein snack without worrying about the sodium content, another mess-free snack are  hard-boiled eggs .      Chia Seed Snacks   Are chia seeds one of your go-to superfoods? Theyre a great option for children, too. Growing kids need essential fatty acids, like the  omega-3s found in chia seeds.  These tiny seeds make for a simple, nutrient-dense addition to homemade smoothies, oatmeal, and baked goods, like these  raspberry muffins .   They might also like chia pudding and can be modified to include your little ones favorite fruits and flavors. Here are  six tasty chia pudding recipes  to get you started. Take 10 minutes to put it together in the morning and itll have transformed into a pudding when its time for dessert.      Edamame   You might only think of edamame as a salad topping or a pre-sushi appetizer, but its also an effortless snack. Its a breeze to prepare (gently boil and sprinkle with a little sea salt), and popping the little beans out of their shells is fun for kids and keeps them occupied  a win-win!   Half a cup of cooked edamame is packed with about 9 grams of plant-based protein and 3 grams of satisfying fiber. Find them in the frozen section in most grocery stores, or the more budget-friendly option,  365 by Whole Foods ."

Easy Tips and Neck Stretches for Neck Pain
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/easy-tips-and-neck-stretches-for-neck-pain,"At some point in your life, youre likely to suffer from a  stiff neck.  Necks are high maintenance because they contain so many muscles and joints, have a large range of motion and contain the nerves that run between your brain and your arms, legs, and organs.   Whether you tweaked it by sleeping in a less-than-ideal position, or you spent too many hours hunched over your computer, or if its just the result of stress, neck pain will usually resolve within a few days to a week, says Armin Tehrany, M.D., an orthopedic surgeon and founder of  Manhattan Orthopedic Care.  If its getting worse or if you have weakness or tingling, pain, burning or numbness radiating down your arms, see a doctor.   In the meantime, these tips may provide some relief if youve got a stiff neck. No twinge? Save them for the next time youre feeling achy:      1. Opt for heat.  If your neck feels sore, tight or stiff, apply a heating pad for 10-15 minutes. You want to use heat for sore muscles, especially in the morning because youve usually slept with your neck in the same position for eight hours, says Tehrany. (If youve had the air conditioner running all night, heat can be especially helpful to your neck muscles the next morning.)      2. Set a timer.  If youre sitting all day at a desk or in front of a computer, Tehrany suggests taking hourly stretch breaks (and while youre at it, walk around for five minutes too). Then stretch: Gently lower your ear to one shoulder for 15 to 30 seconds, and then repeat it and bring your chin to your chest, to the other side, and then to the back. Complete two to four circles in each direction.      3. Tighten your midsection.  A strong core is the best prevention for neck pain, says Tehrany. Surprisingly, weak torso muscles contribute to that office slouch. When your chest caves in and your back rounds, your neck and head tilt back  putting extra strain on the muscles along your spine and over-stretching the muscles along the front of the neck. A simple plank is a good way to boost core strength without any fancy equipment.      4. Put your finger on it.  A research review published in the journal  PLoS One  found that acupressure (massaging traditional acupuncture points) is helpful in treating chronic neck pain. Try these points to ease tension:    Press the thumb of your right hand on the webbing between your left thumb and index finger and put your right index finger underneath to squeeze the muscles. You should feel an achy sensation. Hold for 30 seconds then repeat on the other side.    Next, place your fingers of both hands on either side of your spine at the base of your skull. Slide them out to the side about an inch (you should feel them fall into a trough as you drop off the muscle). Press deeply here and hold for 30 seconds.   You can do these  neck stretches  discreetly at your desk!   5. Do a posture scan.  When youre standing upright, you should be able to draw a straight line from your ear down through your shoulder, hip, and ankle. You may need to roll your shoulders back and down, draw your navel in toward your spine, tighten your glutes, and position your head back to get into the proper position. However, neck pain can be caused by muscle imbalances in the lower body too. A qualified personal trainer or physical therapist can check your posture to identify potential issues.      6. Go hands-free already.  Its 2016. Theresno reason to still be cradling your phone between your ear and shoulder, which can put a serious kink in your neck. Invest in a headset if you use a landline phone or pick up some earphones with a microphone for your cell. Unless you want to be know as the person who uses speakerphone at the office (hint: you dont).      7. Get out the foam roller.  When you have a stiff neck, youll often also feel tightness in your upper and middle back. Try this move daily to counteract slouching and improve mobility in your thoracic spine (the area between your neck and low back). Place a  foam roller  on the floor and sit with knees bent and hands lightly against the sides of your head, elbows forward. Lie back onto the roller so its centered  across the bottom of your shoulder blades. Stay here and breathe deeply for 60-90 seconds as you slowly extend over the roller. Next, lift your hips and scan for tender spots, and repeat, breathing into the discomfort.     8. Take it easy in yoga.  All that stretching is great for your body and mind, but some poses require you to turn your neck or lift your head to extreme degrees, which can  trigger pain  and even (in rare cases) increase your risk of stroke. Always wait until youre adequately warmed up before moving into any extreme ranges of motion. If a pose hurts or feels challenging for your neck, ease off. Nobody will kick you out of class if you dont look up at the ceiling in trikonasana (or triangle pose, see the neck angle).  See yoga pose above.   9. Use your noggin.  Sometimes a massage is worth it: A study in the  Clinical Journal of Pain  showed that almost 80 percent of people with  chronic neck pain  who tried craniosacral therapy, a type of manual therapy that focuses primarily on the head and spine, saw a 50 percent reduction in neck pain after 8 weeks.   Maybe its time to baby your neck a little. How often do you get a stiff neck?"

13 Flavorful Chicken Recipes Under 300 Calories
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/13-flavorful-chicken-recipes-under-300-calories,"We will refrain from the cheesy winner, winner chicken dinner reference (or oops), but seriously: You will  win  at healthy meal prep when you make any or all of these chicken recipes.   If you need some convincing, flip your thinking about lean chicken breasts as boring, bland, and dry, and consider them high-protein vessels that allow the other flavors of a dish to shine. If you use the right ingredients, you can transform poultry into something you might even start craving.   Mexican Chicken Zucchini Boats   These boats are a healthier spin on chicken burritos, swapping in nutritious zucchini for flour tortillas. A typical flour tortilla contains 25 grams of carbohydrates, 458 milligrams of sodium, and not much else. One zucchini contains 10 grams of carbs, 26 milligrams of sodium, as well as vitamins A, C, and K, and minerals like calcium, potassium, and magnesium. Using zucchini as the vessel is also convenient way to watch your portions without having to think too hard: 1 boat = 1 serving.     What youll need:     4 large zucchini, cut in half lengthwise   4 tsp. olive oil, divided use   1 medium onion, finely chopped   2 cloves garlic, finely chopped   1 cup tomato sauce, no sugar added   2 Tbsp. tomato paste, no sugar added   1 Tbsp. ground chili powder (or 1 tsp. chili powder and 1 tsp. ancho chili powder)   1 tsp. ground cumin    tsp. ground paprika   3 cups shredded cooked chicken breast   1 cups corn kernels   1 cup shredded cheddar (or Monterey jack) cheese   2 Tbsp. finely chopped cilantro   1 medium tomato, chopped   2 green onions, thinly sliced     Find out how to  make the recipe .   Calories per serving:  239   Marinated Summer Veggies with Chicken Sausage   In this flavor-rich dish, colorful summer veggies like zucchini, squash, cherry tomatoes, bell peppers, and green beans soak in a tart marinade; chicken sausage adds a boost of protein. Just make sure to use an all-natural chicken sausage to avoid preservatives and keep the sodium low.   The best part? No Top Chef skills needed here  chop, marinate, and cook. Thats it. And if you dont want to broil it (and yourself) in a hot kitchen, you can throw it all on a sheet pan and cook it on the grill  no muss, no fuss.     What youll need:     2 tsp. olive oil   2 Tbsp. balsamic vinegar   2 Tbsp. fresh lime juice   2 cloves garlic, chopped   Sea salt (or Himalayan salt) and ground black pepper (to taste; optional)   1 lb. green beans, ends removed   2 medium zucchini, sliced   2 medium summer (crookneck) squash, sliced   1 cup halved cherry tomatoes   1 medium green bell pepper, sliced   1 medium red onion, sliced   4 cooked chicken sausages, sliced   2 Tbsp. chopped fresh basil     Find out how to  make the recipe .   Calories per serving:  273   Lemon Garlic Chicken Thighs   Under 300 calories? Try this zippy, moist chicken thats  under 200 calories . Granted, this only includes the chicken and not any sides, but you can top a salad or a bowl of zoodles with this light and lovely protein. The sweet and savory flavors of the marinade  you get a fresh, acidic bite from lemon juice, savory complexity from Worcestershire sauce, and a touch of sweet from raw honey  make it unnecessary to dress accompanying vegetables with much more than a bit of balsamic and extra virgin olive oil.     What youll need:      cup fresh lemon juice    cup raw honey (or pure maple syrup)   1 Tbsp. Worcestershire sauce   6 cloves garlic, finely chopped   2 lbs. raw chicken thighs, boneless, skinless (about 8 thighs)   Nonstick cooking spray    tsp. sea salt (or Himalayan salt)    tsp. ground black pepper   Lemon wedges (for garnish; optional)   Fresh parsley sprigs (for garnish; optional)     Find out how to  make the recipe .

Why ‘Clean Eating’ Isn’t The Same as Educated Eating
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/why-clean-eating-isnt-the-same-as-educated-eating,"Instagram users upload  80 million  photos on a given day. Granted, many of them are blurry selfies, memes, baby pics, and landscape shots, 99 percent of which have been mutilated by a gross misunderstanding of filter etiquette.   But a bundle of those 80M is also of food: colorful salads that overflow the plate, mason jars filled with overnight oats, protein muffins, tender steaks, the freshest green juices to ever pour from a Vitamix, and so on.   The ubiquitous hashtag they use? #cleaneating. But, what is clean eating? A fad? A lifestyle? A hashtag to get more people to see your photos?   Thats a good question, says Denis Faye, Beachbodys senior director of nutrition content. In my opinion, clean eating should be shorthand for eat lots of fruits and vegetables and less processed food.   Unfortunately, its getting a bit overused as a cleanse type of thing, as in, I need some cleaning eating now I think you should be eating clean all of the time. Itd be pretty neat if the buzzword was educated eating.   So What Exactly Is Clean Eating?   With all the buzzwords out there, Fayes desire for more education could certainly come in handy. A 2014 study published in the journal  Food Studies  found that  buzzwords on packaging  i.e. organic, antioxidants and all natural  proved confusing to a 318-person test pool.   How confusing? The group rated  every product  that featured a buzzword healthier than the same product without the word on the label. You know, because antioxidant-rich soda is, like, way better for you than normal, rot-your-teeth soda that is void of antioxidant benefits.   The basic tenets of eating healthy (or would it be eating clean, or clean eating  see how confusing it is!) havent changed in about a zillion years: Consume fewer processed and fried foods, and eat more fruits and veggies.Those are two pretty important rules I think everyone should follow, says Faye.   Also, munching on too many clean foods can still lead to weight gain. Portion control and keeping macros in line with fitness goals is still important.   When I was a kid, I was really unhealthy and fat, says Faye. We had a salad bar at my school, so my [lunch] every day would be iceberg lettuce, ham, and peanuts, and Id drown the whole thing in Thousand Island dressing. I was so ignorant about food that I assumed  that  was healthy.   Some food and health writers have hypothesized that the term clean eating has evolved into an elitist way of shaming folks who cant afford to shop at Whole Foods or dont have a farmers market near their home.   When I give people a diet, I do it with the understanding that Im giving them a baseline, Faye explains. If I go where people are struggling economically, I wont start to lecture them on organics  thats absurd.   But, what transcends economics for the majority is the lack of understanding about  what is and isnt healthy  when it comes to food. Some simplification might be in order: Eat as many whole foods as close to their natural state as possible that you can afford. And pass that message along. #educatedeating"

How to Meal Prep When You Travel
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/how-to-meal-prep-when-you-travel,"The last time I flew the friendly skies, the in-flight snacks were about as far from healthy as they could be. Shortly after take-off, the flight attendant handed me a box containing a puff pastry stuffedwith cheese and tomato sauce, and a bright pink, raspberry-flavored cake. A few hours later, he returned with paper cups filled with chocolate ice cream. I kid you not ice cream has replaced peanuts on some airplanes. When I was younger, I might have thought this was the coolest airline ever. But asa person who now tries to steer clear of sugar and processed foods, I was woefully out of my comfort zone  and I was hungry.   How had I neglected to follow theadvice I so often give to others, and left home without bringing anything healthy to eat with me? I resolved then and there to never again get stuck in an airport or on a planewithout a sandwich, or at least a few protein-rich snacks in my bag.   Road trips pose a similar problem. It can be just as challenging to find a healthy meal near a highway stop. Heck, even the  supposedly healthy options at fast food restaurants can have as many calories as the burgers and fries.   When peopletravel, theyput a lot of thought into what to pack in theirsuitcases but hardly any about what theyll eat. The next time you travel or hit the road,dont forget to pack some healthy snacks. Those especiallydedicated to meal prep might evenprepare afew balanced meals, and carry them in an insulated bag.TSA allows most foods to pass through security (read their rules  here ). Liquids, like peanut butter or salad dressing, need to be in containers and weigh less than three ounces. For road trips, foods that can be eaten with your hands and wont make a mess in the car are best. Get more ideas for great road trip snacks  here.   Check out these great ideas for travel meal prep to fuel your next adventure.   Plan ahead for the whole family     Now THIS is how to pack for a family road trip!  @wholefoodnanny  fed her family three meals and plenty of snacks during a 25-hour drive across the country, and bragged that they never had to stop for fast food. Purchasing healthy, prepared snacks and whole fruit gave her extra time to make homemade  Energy Balls  and  Ranch Dressing . This kind of prep takes a bit of planning, but the effort pays off!   Choose foods to mix and match     Meals on the road are notorious diet-wreckers, bur not for  @meowmeix . Her simple meal prep covered all of the bases to help keep her on track with her nutrition plan. She packed breakfast, snacks, lean protein, and cut vegetables that she could munch as snacks or mix together for a meal. She brought unsweetened instant oatmeal, sliced cucumbers, baked sweet potatoes, shredded chicken, bell peppers, baby carrots, a whole lot of mixed nuts (we hope she was sharing!), and travel packets of  Beachbody Performance  Recover to refuel after her workouts.   Keep perishable foodscool     @chiris_roccio_fit  said, Traveling doesnt have to mess with your meal-prep game. You just gotta have the right tools for the job. For Chris, one of those tools is his extra-large insulated lunch bag. He packed it with an impressive array of meals, snacks, and  Beachbody Performance  supplements for his trip to Beachbody Coach Summit. He included a few balanced meals of chicken, veggies, and carbs, plus lots of extra protein in the form of hardboiled eggs and tins of wild-caught sardines.

An in-flight snackcan be as easy as this chicken and cucumber combo from @allisonliveswell . Shes got protein and fiber (and a good book) to keep her satisfied until she lands.   Snack packs to the rescue     Travel can be stressful. Packing travel snacks doesnt have to be. When youve got a dozen last-minute priorities to take care of before you catch an Uber to the airport, slicing vegetables and hard-boiling eggs arent on the list. Skip the time in the kitchen and stash a selection of pre-packaged healthy snacks like jerky, freeze-dried fruit, and packets of almond butter into your carry-on like  @jessicabootsy .   Dont forget to hydrate     Airplanes have lower humidity levels than the Sahara Desert, and you wouldnt travel there without water, would you? Avoid the sticker shock of the bottled water for sale past the TSA checkpoint by bringing an empty canteen and filling it at a drinking fountain at the departure gate. Extra points if you follow  @the_smallseed s lead and add fresh herbs or slices of fruit to flavor your beverage container.   Just add water     If tea is your, uh, cup of tea, make sure to stasha few sachets for your trip. Many hotels have coffee machines in the room that can also heat water for your cuppa.

Is Sugar Really That Bad for You?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/is-sugar-really-that-bad-for-you,"Sugar. Its been tied to  diabetes ,  obesity ,  hyperactivity , and  dental cavities . Its sweet and crave-worthy, and (too often) added to processed foods to improve taste, texture, and shelf life. Sugar is in everything from tomato sauce to salad dressings to organic all natural baby foods. We cant escape it, and, generally, were eating far too much of it.   On average, Americans consume more than  300 calories per day  of added sugar  thats 82 grams or 19.5 teaspoons  and teens are consuming much more, a whopping  28+ teaspoons !   How Much Sugar Is OK?   The World Health Organization (WHO) recommends free sugar (sugars added by the manufacturer, cook, consumer, as well as other concentrated sugar sources like agave, honey, and fruit juice) intake to be less than 10 percent of total daily calories. On a 2,000-calorie diet, that would mean consuming less than 200 calories, or 50 grams per day of free sugar.   The WHO also suggests that there is  convincing evidence  to further reduce free sugar intake to less than five percent of total calories per day (100 calories, or 25 grams of free sugar on a 2,000-calorie diet). In real-life equivalents, five percent is about the amount of free sugar found in one cup of sweetened Greek yogurt.   The  American Heart Association  has similar recommendations for added sugar. Their limit per day is no more than 100 calories of free sugar for women and 150 calories for men.   These recommendations do not refer to the naturally occurring sugars found in whole fruits, vegetables, and unsweetened dairy. One of the big differences between added sugars (think: granulated sugar or high fructose corn syrup) and natural sugars (think: fructose, or the sugar found in fruit) is added sugars lack nutritional value. Sure, certain processed foods that contain added sugars can be fortified with vitamins, minerals, and even fiber, but they dont have naturally-occurring phytonutrients and antioxidants that natural sources of sugar, like strawberries, do. Theyre just empty calories.   Read more:   Should You Avoid Fruit Because of Its Sugar Content?   Where Sugar Hides   The current Nutrition Facts Label doesnt differentiate between natural and added sugars, making it a challenge to know how much added sugar you are actually consuming. The  new changes to the label  will include separate lines for amount of total sugars and added sugars. These changes will provide more transparency in labeling and hopefully encourage food companies to reduce the added sugars in their products.   Until then, the only way to know if added sugars are in the food you are consuming is to read the ingredients list. Ingredients on the label are listed in greatest to least amount, but manufacturers are getting sneaky by using multiple sources of sugar so that a singular source doesnt appear high on the list.   To spot sugar in the line up, check for words like:     fruit juice concentrate   fruit juice   cane juice   turbinado   invert sugar   beet sugar   malt syrup   corn syrup solids   dextrin   words that end in  ose  like maltose, dextrose, fructose, glucose     Remember, added sugars are added sugars, no matter what lingo they are disguised under.   Ways to Slash Sugar   If youre trying to eat better, improve fitness, manage or reduce the risk of disease, and/or lose weight, the best advice is to reduce added sugar consumption, including those more natural yet still concentrated sugar sources like agave, honey, and fruit juice.   Keep your added sugar intake in check by eating a variety of foods in their natural state, i.e. fresh fruits, fresh vegetables, whole grains that you cook yourself, lean proteins without sauces and marinades, and unsweetened dairy. Read ingredient labels. To cut out added sugar in a healthy way, assess your current sugar situation, and make moderate changes to progress toward your sugar goal. Drastic measures can lead to dieting, extreme or ridged thinking, and obsessive behavior, which is not the desired result.   Yes, you can still have your cake and eat it too, but eat your fruits and veggies most often. Moderation is king; sugar is not the demon its the  amount  of sugar that makes the difference."

Watermelon Fruit Pizza
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/watermelon-fruit-pizza-recipe,"How  Pinterest -perfect are these watermelon fruit pizzas? Theyre made of juicy, delicious fruits layered on top of Greek yogurt and luscious watermelon slices. Theyre almost too pretty to eat! But lets be real, no food is ever  that  pretty.     Lets talk about watermelon for a second. Its refreshing, sweet, and delicious, but watermelons are usually enormous (unless theyre baby watermelons, which are adorable), which means you can provide snacks for a whole party with just one. Watermelon is in season year-round, and U.S. harvests are available between April and November and it can be chopped into cubes, muddled into a slush, sliced into triangles, or even carved into  sharks   perfect for a fruity spin on pizza.     For this Watermelon Pizza, Greek yogurt acts as the sauce, adds a teeny burst of protein, and works as a tart and creamy contrast to the fruit. Without it, this recipe would essentially be a stacked fruit salad, and lets be honestthat also sounds pretty tasty. Finally, we topped the pizza with blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, and kiwi. Talk about a brilliant flavor profile. The toppings add a powerful punch of antioxidants and bold, bright flavors  the pepperoni to the crust, if you will and kiwifruit orbs boast a level of tang that cant be found in other fresh produce and packed with vitamin C and fiber, making them the cherry (or kiwi) on top of this recipe.   Watermelon Fruit Pizza   Total Time:  10 min.   Prep Time:  10 min.   Cooking Time:  None   Yield:  4 servings   Ingredients   1-inch thick slice fresh watermelon, cut into 4 wedges (quarters)  4 Tbsp. reduced fat (2%) plain Greek yogurt  4 medium strawberries, sliced  2 Tbsp. fresh blueberries   cup fresh blackberries  1 kiwi fruit, cut into 4 slices  4 fresh mint leaves   Preparation   1. Spread each watermelon wedge with 1 Tbsp. yogurt. Top evenly with strawberries, blueberries, blackberries, and a kiwi slice.  2. Garnish with mint leaves; serve immediately.   Variation:  Eliminate kiwi and increase blackberries to  cup.       Note:  Because such a small amount of Greek yogurt is used, you only need to count this toward your purple containers.

Buffet Style Meal Prep with Shredded Chicken, Roasted Veggies, and More
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/buffet-style-meal-prep-with-shredded-chicken-roasted-veggies-and-more,"The weather is warm, the sun is shining, and the last thing anyone wants to do is spend time in a hot, stuffy kitchen. But unless you have the willpower of Chris Hemsworth training to be Thor, it might be hard to avoid summertime temptations like hot dogs, potato salad, and ribs. Meal prep can help. By arming yourself with healthy food for the whole week, its easy to stay on track with your nutrition goals.   And healthy food doesnt have to take a long time to make! Our resident meal prep master, Social Media Manager  Amanda Meixner , is a pro at coming up with yummymenus that follow the  Portion Fix  container system. Her schedule is packed with yoga teacher training and doing weekend workouts at the beach, and she doesnt always want to spend her Sunday afternoons creating elaborate meal preps. But instead of skipping it, she just simplifies it.   This week, she made overnight oats with Shakeology for breakfast, and added in a different fruit each day. For lunch and dinner, she prepared roasted vegetables, shredded chicken, hard boiled eggs, and quinoa for a buffet-style meal prep fit for a queen. Throughout the week, she mixed and matched the already prepared food for quick and easy meals. Take a look below to see how Amanda combined the food to make healthy, well rounded meals. She eats at the 1,5001,800 calorie level, but, depending on your goals, you might need to eat more or less food. Follow your portion plan to map out how you should fill your plate. A good rule of thumb for each meal is to have at least two Green containers, one to two Red containers, and one to two Yellow containers.      Here is what Amandas buffet-style meal prep looks like this week:          Heres what Amanda iseating:   Proteins  Shredded chicken  Hard-boiled eggs  Shakeology   Vegetables  Raw baby carrots  Cucumber and bell pepper salad  Celery  Roasted cauliflower  Roasted broccoli and mushrooms  Sauted red cabbage  Mixed greens   Fruits  (not shown)  Bananas  Apples   Carbs  Quinoa  Baked sweet potatoes  Oatmeal   Healthy fats  (not shown)  Almond butter  avocados   Seeds/Oils  Balsamic vinaigrette dressing  Olive oil  Sesame oil   Seasonings  Low-sodium chicken broth   Drinks  (optional)   Kombucha  (8 ounces count as 1 Yellow on  21 Day Fix )      With buffet-style meal prep, every meal can have variety. Mix and match the foods you want, when you want them.  Heres how Amanda combined these prepared foods into two different lunches:     Meal 1:   cup shredded chicken, 1 cup cauliflower,  cup broccoli and mushrooms,  cup cabbage, 1 large sweet potato (Portion Fix containers: 2+ Green, 1 Red, 2 Yellow, 1 tsp.)        Meal 2:   cup shredded chicken,  cup broccoli and mushrooms,  cup cabbage,  cup cucumber,  cup bell pepper,  cup quinoa (Portion Fix containers = 2+ Green, 1 Red, 1 Yellow, 1 tsp.)      Follow these simple steps to make Amandas buffet-style meal prep:   1. First, bake the sweet potatoes. Preheat your oven to 375F. Scrub four sweet potatoes to clean them, then place on a large baking sheet. Cook the sweet potatoes for about 35 to 40 minutes, or until they pierce easily with a fork. When cool, place sweet potatoes in the refrigerator.   2. Next, roast the cauliflower, broccoli, and mushrooms. Turn your oven up to 450F. On a large baking sheet, add10 ouncessliced mushrooms and12 ounces chopped broccoli. On another baking sheet, add12 ounces chopped cauliflower. Drizzle with two teaspoons olive oil, and place in oven for about 30 to 40 minutes. Remove from oven and let them cool.   3. Chop half a head of red cabbage. In a medium pan, heattwo teaspoons olive oil. Add the chopped cabbage and cook for approximately10minutes, or until soft.   4. Place eight eggs in a saucepan, and add enough water to cover the eggs by one inch. Bring water just to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 12 minutes. While eggs cook, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Carefully remove the eggs from the hot water with a slotted spoon and transfer to the ice water. Place in refrigerator.   5.  A rice cooker will make quick work of cooking the quinoa, and will shut off automatically when its done. If you do not have a rice cooker,  it can be cooked on a stovetop . Cook one cup of quinoa in two cups water and then set aside to cool.   6. To make the chicken, place a 16-ounce chicken breast into a pan with one cup low-sodium chicken broth (just enough to cover the chicken). Add two teaspoons of olive oil and desired seasonings. Bring to a boil and let simmer for 1520 minutes. Cover and turn heat down to low. Continue to cook for another 4575 minutes or until chicken shreds when you use a fork. Use two forks to pull the chicken apart. Its easier to shred the chicken while its still warm.   7. Prepare the oatmeal jars. Set out five pint-sized mason jars. To each, add  cup oats, one scoop Shakeology, 1 cup fruit, and water to mix. Cover and place in refrigerator.   8. Slice two cucumbers and two bell peppers. Drizzle with 1or 2teaspoons balsamic vinegar or sesame oil, mix, and refrigerate.   9. Cut a stalk of celery into smaller pieces and put into a container."

Quinoa with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Pesto
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/quinoa-with-sun-dried-tomatoes-and-pesto-recipe,"Theres no sauce more versatile and satisfying than pesto. You can serve it hot and poured over pasta, cold and spread on a sandwich, or tossed with quinoa and sun-dried tomatoes, like in this beautiful recipe weve whipped up for you.   Pesto and sun-dried tomatoes are meant for each other. A match made in zesty, earthy heaven. So lets talk about sun-dried tomatoes for a second. These tiny morsels of giant flavor were originally created out of utility. Centuries ago, Italian farmers gave their harvests a longer shelf life by salting and evaporating tomatoes, allowing the community to reap their nutritional benefits year-round. Tomatoes are known for being high in the antioxidant lycopene, which is responsible for their red hue and  disease-preventing properties . Surprisingly, sun-dried tomatoes are actually higher in lycopene than their fresh counterparts, making them as healthful as they are flavorful. Also, I may have eaten them straight out of the bag once or twice or yesterday. I think the farmers of yesteryear would be proud.     But back to pesto; this recipe keeps tradition with basil, extra virgin olive oil, and garlic, but turns up the nourishment with nutritional yeast and hemp seeds instead of the customary pine nut. Hemp seeds are packed with omega fatty acids, fiber, and protein. And to address what were all thinking, the only high youll get from hemp seeds is a nutritional one.     Finally, the all-powerful superfood, quinoa. Its no longer a new, mysterious seed (the part we actually eat is the seed) only enjoyed by hippies. Americans have welcomed it as an acceptable alternative to rice, which is great news due to its excellent health benefits. Higher in protein than brown rice, and brimming with essential amino acids, quinoa is always a terrific choice. Plus, it cooks much faster than rice.     This recipe for Quinoa with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Pesto is basically a bowl of superfood that tastes incredible. Its perfect for a potluck, or made ahead and taken to the office for lunch.   Quinoa with Sun-Dried Tomatoes and Pesto   Total Time: 50 min.  Prep Time: 20 min.  Cooking Time: None  Yield: 8 servings, about  cup each   Ingredients    cup sun-dried tomatoes  Hot water  1 cup packed fresh basil leaves   cup hemp seeds (or coarsely chopped walnuts)  2 cloves garlic, chopped   tsp. nutritional yeast   tsp. sea salt (or Himalayan salt)   tsp. ground black pepper  1 Tbsp. water  2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil  4 cups cooked quinoa  2 cups fresh baby spinach   1. Soak sun-dried tomatoes in hot water for 30 minutes. Drain well; slice thinly. Set aside.  2.

Returning to Exercise After Pregnancy
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/returning-to-exercise-after-pregnancy,"ByJenileeMatz   Yes, you can get your body back after pregnancy. Our experts claim that giving birth is like running a very hilly marathon. Theyre both grueling endurance events with a sweet prize at the finish line  whether thats a gold medal, a personal best, or even better, a brand-new baby. Another factor these physical activities have in common: Your body will be exhausted and worn out afterward, and you may need to take it slowly until you receive the all clear from your health practitioner.   Like after any intense endurance race, your muscles, hips, and internal organs will need some time to recover. That said, its not long before many new moms start wondering when and how they can return to exercise after giving birth.   According to Nicole Dorsey, M.S., a Los Angeles-based exercise physiologist who specializes in pregnancy and exercise, picking up your pre-baby activity level slowly (but soon) is a must, as long as your health practitioner gives the OK. Not only will your heroic return to exercise aid in shedding the baby weight, but consistent exercise boasts a ton of other health benefits for new moms.   Dorsey, who teaches postnatal fitness classes, says, Being active again can boost your energy, restore muscle tone, condition the abdominal muscles, prevent lower back pain, and help stave off postpartum depression.      How to get yourbody back after pregnancy   According to the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG), exactly when you can return to exercise postpartum depends on the type of childbirth you had. In the past, the rule of thumb was to wait six weeks before you started a fitness routine. However, ACOG now says that if you had an uncomplicated vaginal delivery, its normally fine to start gently exercising a few days after your baby is born, or whenever you feel ready. If you delivered by cesarean section, ask your doctor when its safe for you to exercise. A C-section makes things tougher but not impossible, says Dorsey.     Tune into your body before jumping back in   Returning to fitness after having a baby can be nerve-racking. Theres nothing to feel bad about if you take it slow and tune into your body  you know your strengths and physical weaknesses probably better than anyone else, including your gyno, insists Dorsey. But she notes, Your return to exercise is normally easier if you were moderately fit and strong during your pregnancy, if you had a natural delivery, and if you maintained a moderate exercise program throughout.      These six simple tips can help keep you safe and motivated as youreturn to a more active lifestyle with baby:      1. Ease into it.  Return to exercise slowly. Try 10 minutes at a time, then 15, 20, etc. Gradually increase the intensity and length of your sweat sessions, slowly add resistance to a bike, or incrementally increase the incline if youre working out on the treadmill. (Be reasonable, says Dorsey. Dont initiate a new sport or return to barrel racing or bungee jumping within the first few weeks after having a baby! Be good to yourself and use common sense.)      2. Vary your routine. Switching up your workouts can help you stick with it. Dorsey suggests starting with long walks and postnatal Pilates classes, Beachbody On Demand, or DVDs. She also stresses that strength training is extra important for new moms . Youll be constantly holding, nursing, and carrying your baby for the next few months, Dorsey says. Most new mothers suffer from stiff necks, weak arms, and very poor posture. But regular strength training and other resistance exercises can counter these effects.      3. Include your baby. Dont wait until you have childcare to exercise. Rather, pick a workout your baby can be part of. Include your baby by pushing your little one in a stroller, or putting her next to you while you stretch or perform core work.      4. Grab a postnatal friend. Workout buddies are key for accountability. Knowing you have someone counting on you will make you less likely to skip your fitness session. Also, be sure to warm up thoroughly and cool down after every single workout.      5. Drink up. Drink plenty of fluids before, during, and after exercise to stay hydrated, especially if youre breastfeeding; your body and your baby both desperately need the added healthy hydration.      6. Be prepared if youre breastfeeding.  According to the Mayo Clinic , some studies have indicatedthat intense exercise (marathoners were tested) can cause lactic acid to build up in breastmilk. This wont harm your baby, but it may cause the taste of your breastmilk to be unpleasant. However, many breastfeeding moms do triathlons and marathons without having their babies refuse their milk, so dont go looking for trouble!      Nursing moms should also wear supportive bras and time their feedings with workout sessions. The Mayo Clinic suggests tryingto feed your baby or use a breast pump right before exercising so your body is more comfortable (your breasts will not be so likely to leak) and your mind is more at ease.   Most importantly, have patience, and be lenient with yourself. You just ran the most grueling marathon of your life! Not only are you recovering from childbirth, but youre also dealing with sleep deprivation, changing hormones, and the demands of caring for a newborn. Its OK if you need to take an extra rest day or cut a workout short.   Remember that some exercise is always better than none, and even 10 minutes of moving that beautiful,new body around almost instantly improves the moods of mothers everywhere."

No-Cook Meal Prep for the 1,200–1,500 Calorie Level
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/no-cook-meal-prep-for-the-1200-1500-calorie-level,"With temperatures breaching the 100s in Los Angeles this past weekend, the last thing I wanted to do was turn on my stove or oven. But Sunday night was fast approaching, and I knew I would regret skipping my meal prep for the week if I didnt get my act together. Thats when I had the brilliant idea of doing a no-cook meal prep.   Weve featured a  no-cook meal prep  before, so I knew it was possible to create a weeks worth of healthy meals without heating up the kitchen. I modified the menu to 1,2001,500 calories and drafted my grocery list. Then, with a small army of fans at my side (my apartment doesnt have central air conditioning), I set up shop in the kitchen to prep for the week to come.   Though moving at all was enough to make me sweat, the no-cook meal prep plan allowed me to assemble healthy meals with fresh, flavorful ingredients in record time. Juicy berries in an oatmeal jar for breakfast, crunchy tuna lettuce cups for lunch, savory Asian chicken wraps for dinner   Although the chilled meals were a delight to eat in the middle of June, I did have one warm dish; I popped a frozen veggie patty into the microwave (I hate to break it to you, but this doesnt  really  count as cooking).   This meal prep is ideal for a summer heat wave, or if cooking isnt one of your strengths, or if you dont have a lot of time to spend on meal prep.   Follow this guide to make your own no-cook meal prep, complete with step-by-step instructions and a grocery list. Its made for the 1,2001,500 calorie range.

The Best Sunscreens to Buy in 2016
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/the-best-sunscreens-to-buy-in-2016,"By Marygrace Taylor   Summers finally here, and the living sure is easy. Or is it? If youre planning on spending some fun-filled time in the sun, you might be scratching your head trying to find a good sunscreen to toss in your beach bag. What SPF do you really need? Should you use a mineral sunscreen or one made with chemical filters? And will you be happier with a lotion, spray, or stick?   Of course, its good that youre thinking about this stuff at all, instead of forgoing sunscreen entirely. Protecting your skin from the suns harmful rays is serious business, not just for guarding against skin cancer but also because the suns rays play a large role in aging the skin. So, its smart to pick a sunscreen you feel good about using every day and then supplement as needed for special situations (playing sports outside, swimming, etc.).   Before diving into the best picks for 2016, lets take a moment to point out four key things you should always look for when buying a sunscreen. According to the  American Academy of Dermatologists , you should seek out sunscreens that are:      SPF 30.  Resist the urge to use a lower SPF for the sake of your tan. In order to really protect against skin cancer, your sunscreen needs to be at least SPF 30. (Higher SPFs offer little additional protection, and they dont last any longer.)   Broad-spectrum.  This means your sunscreen shields against against both UVA rays (which hit the deepest layer of your skin)  and  UVB rays (which burn the top layers of your skin), giving you the maximum protection against skin cancer and sunburns.   Water-resistant.  Because even if youre not going swimming, youre probably going to sweat. Water-resistant lotions will protect your skin even if it gets wet.   Mineral ingredients.  Sunscreens containing chemical filterslike oxybenzone avobenzone, octisalate, octocrylene, homosalate and octinoxate may mimic human hormones and cause skin irritation or allergies, says the  Environmental Working Group ,. Instead, look for mineral sunscreens with active ingredients like zinc oxide and/or titanium dioxide. Theyre safer than their chemical filter counterparts, and will do just as good of a job at shielding you from harmful rays.   Of course, some sunscreens that meet these criteria are still better than others. (Chalkiness, weird smells, or gunky textures? No thanks.)     These EWG-approved sunscreens are clean, effective, and all-around great options.        For everyday protection   A solid, all-purpose sunscreen should work for both your body and face, be easy to apply, and fight hard to keep your skin safe all day every day. Kiss My Face Organics Face & Body Mineral Sunscreen SPF 30 ($13.99,  kissmyface.com ) checks all of these boxes, while delivering green tea and sunflower oil for an extra layer of protection. Thanks to the  antioxidants  and vitamins in these ingredients, theyre a  natural source of SPF  and also help keep skin  moisturized . Prefer a spray? Try Honest Mineral Sunscreen Spray SPF 30 ($13.95,  honest.com ).      For sports   When youre active, you need a sunscreen that can keep up with you, no matter how sweaty you get. All Good SPF 33 Sport Sunscreen Lotion ($15.99,  amazon.com ) is hypoallergenic (meaning its unlikely to cause an allergic reaction), leaves zero white residue, and boasts rejuvenating ingredients like organic green tea, rose hip antioxidants, and organic jojoba oil.      For kids   If youre looking for a lotion, try Belly Buttons & Babies Sunscreen Lotion, SPF 30 ($22,  bellybuttonsandbabies.com ). Its fragrance-free, so its gentle on your little ones skin. Looking for a kid-friendly stick for easier application? California Baby Everyday/Year-Round Sunscreen Stick, SPF30+ is the sunscreen for you ($26.99 for a two-pack,  amazon.com ).      For when you need a travel-sized option   The best sunscreen is the one you have on hand at all times and actually use. When youre on the go, try a stick like Badger Unscented Sunscreen Face Stick, SPF 35 ($8.55,  amazon.com ). Its small size makes it easy to stow anywhere, and its easier to apply than a lotion or spray.      For acne-prone skin   If your skin is oily, the last thing you want to do is slather on a greasy sunscreen. Derma e Antioxidant Natural Defense Sunscreen ($15.43,  amazon.com ) is made just for your faceso its oil-free and wont clog your pores. Plus, its fortified with antioxidants like vitamin C to promote younger-looking skin.      Of course, whichever sunscreen you pick, itll only protect you if you use it correctly. According to the  American Academy of Dermatology , you should apply sunscreen to dry skin 15 minutes  before  you go outside, so youre fully protected as soon as you step out into the sun. (You should use a full ounce, or the amount that would fill a shot glass, to cover your entire body.) And set your phone to remind you to reapply every two hours, or do so right after swimming or sweating. Your skin will thank you."

Beachbody Results: Madeline Lost 27 Pounds and Won $1,000!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-madeline-lost-27-pounds-and-won-1000,"Madeline Lemay, age 40, lost 27 lbs with  21 Day Fix ,  PiYo , and  The Masters Hammer and Chisel . She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  My daughter had just turned three and I realized that I was still a size 12 and I hadnt lost my baby weight. I was looking at pictures of myself from her birthday party and I was not happy. I constantly wore baggy clothes to hide my fat rolls. I would workout like crazy and not lose any weight, and I couldnt figure out what I was doing wrong. I felt frumpy.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I was inspired by a few friends of mine that did yoga. I was amazed at how their bodies moved in certain poses, and I wanted to be them. I wanted to wear fancy leggings and look good in a tank top. The support on Instagram was overwhelming about being comfortable in your own body which made me realize that I was comfortable in my own body. I met someone on there that introduced me to  Shakeology  and wellness coaching, and it all took off from there.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  The program that I used to lose the weight was Hammer and Chisel. It was definitely hard to keep up. I had to make a lot of modifications but I never gave up. I didnt use the bench, but I was able to add weights in eventually. That along with the PiYo DVD for stretching made an enormous difference in my endurance and flexibility. Not to mention the fact that I lost 27 pounds, it made it easier to move. Now I can do handstands, arm balances, inversions, and I feel light as a feather. Im healthier from the meal plans and stronger than I ever was when I used to work out at the gym. I feel like Shakeology and Beachbody literally saved my life!   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I love all of the programs to be honest. I just started the 21 Day Fix and its equally amazing. I love how excited the trainers are in the videos that they make me smile and giggle while working out. They make it fun! I dont feel alone like I did on the treadmill everyday.     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  Im so proud that I have achieved diamond status and that so many people have entrusted me with their health and fitness journey. I feel excited to help people everyday. I feel great and energized everyday just from drinking the shakes.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I have become a successful Coach for Beachbody and recently earned diamond status. Everyone has been so impressed with my achievements and my results that they are ready for my help. And I am so happy to be able to share my journey with them as well as help them along their own personal journey.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  Jamie has always been very supportive with any of my goals that I am trying to accomplish. She is right there with the answer to any question that I have.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  Yes to all of the above, hahaha. I have IBS so I am not able to eat as many salads or raw vegetables as everyone else. So being able to drink the amount of nutrients that is in each shake is amazing. I feel like I have more energy. My coffee intake has gone down to one cup a day. I sleep better at night. Im an overall happier healthier person. Everyone notices how I smile more..and I seem happy.   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed! Complete any Beachbody program, and enter your results for a free gift and a chance to win cash and prizes.     Results vary depending on starting point, goals, and effort."

Start by baking the sweet potatoes. Preheat oven to 450 F. Wash and scrub 2 pounds of sweet potatoes. Pierce each sweet potato several times with a fork and place them on the center rack in your oven. Bake for 3545 minutes, or until tender when pierced. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.   2.  Next, bake chicken breasts. On a second baking sheet or dish, arrange 2 pounds of boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Season with any herbs or spices. Place baking dish in the oven for 1520 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink in the middle and juices run clear. Let cool for 20 minutes, then place in refrigerator.   3.  Place 10 eggs in saucepan and add enough water to cover the eggs by one inch. Bring water just to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 12 minutes. While eggs cook, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Carefully remove the eggs from the hot water with a slotted spoon and transfer to the ice water. Place in refrigerator.   4.  To make the Turkey Marinara, add 2 pounds ground lean turkey to a medium pan over medium heat. Cook, stirring frequently, until turkey is no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Add one 25-oz jar tomato sauce, no salt added, and stir. Remove from heat. Use a spiralizer or follow these instructions to make noodles out of 3 pounds of zucchinis: Using a vegetable peeler, cut each zucchini into lengthwise strips about -inch thick. Turn each zucchini slightly after cutting each strip to work evenly around the outside, stopping when you hit the seeds at the core. Discard cores. Cut slices lengthwise into -inch ribbons. Either steam the zucchini noodles in a steamer basket or gently saute them in a nonstick pan coated with cooking spray for 23 minutes. Divide zucchini noodles evenly between three food containers. Top each with one with the fully cooked turkey mixed with tomato sauce, top with 3 Tbsp. of Parmesan, and add a side of  cup of sweet potatoes.   5.  A rice cooker will make quick work of cooking the quinoa, and will shut off automatically when its done. If you do not have a rice cooker,  it can be cooked on a stovetop . Cook  cup quinoa in 1 cup water and then set aside to cool.   6.  Make the roasted tomatoes and eggplant. Preheat oven to 375 F. In a non-stick pan, add 3 tsp. of olive, 2 cupsof plum tomatoes, and 2 eggplants chopped into cubes, spread evenly. Put the pan into the oven for about 20 minutes until roasted.   7. Steam the kale by using a steamer, or follow these instructions: Put about one inch of water into a large pot and bring to a boil. Wash 4 cupsof kale and put it into a metal colander. Place the colander in the pot with the boiling water for about eight minutes until wilted.   8.  Prepare the chicken dinners. Set out two containers. To each, add 6 oz. of the baked boneless, skinless chicken breast and top with 1 cup roasted tomatoes, 1 cup eggplant, and  cup quinoa.   9.  Prepare the turkey lunches. Set out three containers. To each, add 6 oz. ground turkey, 2 cups steamed kale,  cup sweet potato, and 3 Tbsp. avocado.   10.  Make the salad dressing. Place 4 tsp. olive oil and balsamic vinegar to taste in small bowl and mix well. Set aside.   11.  Next build the Salad Jars. Set out three large mason jars (or food storage containers). Add 2 Tbsp. dressing to the bottom of the jar (if youre not using jars, reserve the dressing until just before serving). To each jar add 6 oz. chicken breast, 1 cup spinach,  cup tomatoes,  cup carrots,  cup edamame. Cover and place in refrigerator.   12.  Last, prepare the oatmeal jars. Set out five pint-sized mason jars. To each add  cup oats,  cup Greek yogurt, and 1 cup berries. Cover and place in refrigerator. The oats will absorb the yogurt, and will become soft enough to eat. Serve cold.      Grocery List:   Vegetables  3 bags baby spinach  1 bunch celery  2 10-oz. bags kale  1 9-oz. box shelled edamame  1 avocados  2 lb. sweet potato  2 16-oz. bags baby carrots  6 bell peppers  2 eggplant  3 lb. zucchini squash   Fruits  1 bunch bananas  2 20-oz. containers blackberries   Proteins  2 lb. lean ground turkey  2 lb. chicken breast   Dry and Canned Goods  1 18-oz. container oatmeal  1 16-oz. bag quinoa  1 25-oz. jar tomato sauce, no salt added  1 16-oz. jar almond butter  2 16-oz. containers plum tomatoes  1 12-oz. container raw almonds   Dairy and Eggs  1 dozen eggs  5 7-oz. containers plain, Greek yogurt  .25 lb.

Quick Pickled Red Onions
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/quick-pickled-red-onions-recipe,"Used far too often (in my opinion, anyway) as a garnish, topping or way to overpower a delicate tangle of mixed baby greens, raw onion has an acrid bite thats tamed through a process called pickling.

Drop slices of your onion of choice  red onion adds a gorgeous pop of color to any dish  into the salty-sweet brine and let sit for at least 10 minutes.

Beachbody Results: Benjo Benefits Big-Time By Body Building
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-benjo-benefits-big-time-by-body-building,"Benjo Reyes, age 35, lost 58 lbs. with  21 Day Fix ,  The Masters Hammer and Chisel ,  Shakeology , and the  Beachbody Performance  supplements. He entered his results into the  Beachbody Challenge , and won $1,500!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I was living in denial. For the past 12 years, I kept telling myself that I wasfine and that I could get back to being healthy anytime. Honestly, I kept lying to myself that I could easily get back in shape so I could splurge on food. With each bite of a burger or pizza, I kept saying I couldwork it off later. Well, that later never happened and my weight kept increasing. As my weight increased, I also developed high blood pressure and have been taking meds. I reached 235 pounds, waking up with knee pains and laboring to walk up stairs. I struggled to breathe, to the point of embarrassment, when a co-worker told me I was breathing hard like Darth Vader during a conference call. I hated the fact that I let myself go. I had very low energy and did not enjoy moving much, let alone exercise. I was on the path to an early grave, and it scared me.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  My current Coach kept posting her progress daily on Facebook, and it showed up on my feed each time. It got me to start thinking that if a person I know personally can make a change, then why cant I? So I took the leap of faith and decided to try 21 Day Fix and Shakeology, then decided to jump onto The Masters Hammer and Chisel challenge that started in January 2016. I now have a 10-month-old baby boy, and one thing I did not want to be is a dad who cant even run after his own kid. We have had friends and family who have lost a parent due to obesity, and I did not want to be that for my future child. I made a commitment to myself and to my family that I will start the program and finish so that I can be a healthy individual with energy and confidence.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  Finding time was a challenge for me going into the program. I live an hour away from work and usually work long hours. I did not think I would have the time needed to get my workouts in. I am usually exhausted by the time I get home. So in order to overcome this challenge, I committed myself to wake up early during my first week. So I set my alarm for 4:30 AM, and it was a struggle during my first week.But soon I was able to make it a habit. As I continued with the workouts and my early morning routine, it became easier to wake up early and I found that I had more energy. Also, the traffic on my way home can get pretty congested. Instead of rushing out of my office, I decided to use our wellness room to get an extra 30 minutes of a workout. By finding ways around my time limitations, I was able to get amazing results with The Masters Hammer and Chisel.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I was hitting a plateau late 2015 and needed a new program to break me through to the next level. When The Masters Hammer and Chisel came out, I saw the results my friends werehaving. So I decided to get it. I enjoy that it incorporates weight lifting and cardio with the routines. It helped me gain muscle and lose weight. In 60 days, I lost over 15 pounds and feel much stronger. Sagi and Autumn are both great trainers who, combined together, really drive results.     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  During my first round of The Masters Hammer and Chisel, I was able to shed over 15 pounds and still feel great doing it. I did not lose energy. In fact, I found more energy as the days went by. I was never hungry, because I was eating proportioned meals and snacks throughout the day. But if I were to choose an achievement to be proud of, it would have to be my newfound passion to be healthy and to help others. I found that during my time with the Beachbody program, I truly enjoyed helping motivate and inspire others within my group and circle of friends. I became more involved in our workout group pages, and my attitude toward life became much more positive. As I see other members succeed, it helps motivate me to keep going as well. Anytime someone falls, I do my best to pick them back up and keep going. We are not in this alone, and I am willing to help as much as I can.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  My life truly has taken a 180-degree turn for the better. My recent visit to the doctor proved that these programs work. I am proud to say that I am now off of my blood pressure medication with a clean bill of health. I feel more energized, and my outlook on life is filled with positivity. I am now an active Coach and work toward helping others reach their own goals. I have regained confidence as well and have received many compliments onmy progress. Some have mentioned that I am a great inspiration to them, and I am truly honored by that. I am looking forward to completing my next challenge as well as helping many others complete theirs.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  The group I joined was a tremendous factor in keeping me on track. On the days I was not motivated to work out (and there were many), the group kept urging me to push forward. As others in my group posted their results, I was able to use it as an inspiration. As I sawpeople just like me find success, it drove me to keep on trying until I saw my own success and reached my goals.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  There were many times I felt like I fell off track slightly and that was usually the time I gave up on myself. My Coach and others on my team would follow up and provided the encouragement at the right time to keep me going. They never gave up on me and I truly appreciate that more than they will ever know.   How  did  a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your  transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/ regularity ?   Shakeology  made it easy for me to keep my nutrition on track for the most part. It represented one-thirdof my daily meals, so I really only had to stay accountable for my lunch and dinner. It was a no-brainer for me to keep up with Shakeology, because it gave me all the nutrients I needed to start my day. I also felt more energy throughout the day as I became more consistent with drinking Shakeology.   How  did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program affect any existing health conditions you  have ?  I have had a history of high blood pressure to the point where I have been taking medication the past several years and in increasing doses. I was also at risk of developing diabetes due to my weight. By the time I completed my first round of 21 Day Fix, I checked in with my doctor and he was amazed with my results. My tests came out normal as well, and he immediatelytook me off my meds. Through the addition of The Masters Hammer and Chisel with my later rounds, I was able to maintain a normal blood pressure. That validated my decision to stick with the programs and find more success in my health with Beachbody and its team of Coaches and clients.   Did  you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (e.g. blood pressure, blood sugar, triglycerides, etc. )?  My high blood pressure normalized after a month of the 21 Day Fix Challenge, along with Shakeology and The Masters Hammer and Chisel.   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed! Complete any Beachbody program, and enter your results for a free gift and a chance to win cash and prizes.

The biggest change has been the domino effect my simple decision to take a chance on a Beachbody program has made in my life and my familys life.  I have motivated my husband to change his lifestyle.  My mom and family live a healthier lifestyle, and I have motivated many to get started on their journeys.    Had I not begun my journey, I dont what wouldve become of my marriage. It was headed down the drain!  Today, my husband and I are setting the example together.

Start by baking the sweet potatoes. Preheat oven to 450 F. Wash and scrub seven sweet potatoes. Pierce each one several times with a fork and place them on the center rack in your oven. Bake for 35 to 45 minutes, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Remove from oven and set aside to cool.   2. A rice cooker will make quick work of cooking the quinoa, and will shut off automatically when its done. If you do not have a rice cooker, cook quinoa on the stovetop using this method . Cook 1 cups quinoa in 3 cups water and then set aside to cool. To cool it quickly, remove it from the rice cooker or pan and spread it out on a baking sheet to expose more of its surface area.   3. If you bought dry lentils instead of pre-cooked, cook them next. Sort through the lentils to make sure there are no small stones, then rinse them in a colander under cool water. Bring 3 cups water to a boil in medium saucepan over high heat; add 2 cups dry lentils. Bring the back to a boil, cover the pot, and reduce heat to maintain a gentle boil for about 20 minutes or until lentils are tender. Set aside to cool.   4. Make the vinaigrette. Place  cup olive oil,  cup red wine vinegar, 1 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. honey, 2 Tbsp. lemon juice, and 2 tsp. parsley in small bowl and mix well. Set aside.   5. Next build the Microgreen Salad Jars. Rebecca bought pre-chopped and shredded vegetables to save time. Set out four large Mason jars (or food storage containers). Add 2 Tbsp. dressing to the bottom of the jar (if youre not using jars, reserve the dressing until just before serving). To each jar add  cup chopped jicama,  cup shredded carrot,  red bell pepper,  cucumber,  tomato,  cup sprouts, 1 Tbsp. cilantro, and 3 cups salad greens. Cover and place in refrigerator.   6. Make the Stir-Fried Veggies. Add 1 Tbsp. coconut oil and 1 Tbsp. sesame oil to a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat. Add two chopped carrots and cook, stirring constantly, for two minutes. Add one cup broccoli and continue to cook, stirring frequently, for four minutes. Add one chopped red bell pepper and one chopped zucchini. Cook two to three minutes or until tender-crisp. Turn off heat. Add two Tbsp. Bragg Liquid Aminos, and mix well. Set aside to cool. When stir-fried veggies have cooled, divide them evenly between four food storage containers. To each container add a baked sweet potato and one cup quinoa. Place in refrigerator.   7. Rebecca made her miso soup just before eating it, but you can prepare a large batch for the week all at once. Bring eight cups of water to a boil, then turn off the heat. In a small bowl mix four Tbsp. of miso paste with  cup of the hot water until blended. Add the miso and water mixture to the pot along with  cup seaweed and four chopped green onions. Let cool.

Transformation Tuesday: Maria Lost 26 Pounds with Hip Hop Abs!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-maria-lost-26-pounds-with-hip-hop-abs,"Maria had a three-year-old son that she couldnt play with because she was out of shape. She hadnt been able to lose the baby weight for years, and when a fitness contest popped up at her work, she had the perfect opportunity to get back in shape. She completed Hip Hop Abs, and was able to lose 26 pounds in 2 months! Heres her story in her own words:   I couldnt play with my son without losing my breath.  My clothes didnt fit right, I looked in the mirror or at pictures and felt depressed about how fat I was getting and how unhealthy I was feeling.  I was tired all the time.  My weight prevented me from running, jumping, dancing, and playing with my son.   Someone at the school where I work decided to do a biggest loser competition. A friend gave me  INSANITY  to try to lose weight from home, but I knew I was not ready for such a hard routine. However, I loved Shaun Ts voice and how he motivated everyone, so I looked him up.  Since I love dancing,  Hip Hop Abs  caught my attention , so I went ahead and ordered the program. Dancing was one of my passions, and I always wanted to learn  hip hop . And hey,  if I could do abs without actually doing abs, it was the way to go!   I followed it to the T! We had weekly weigh-ins at school, and celebrated every time I lost 2 pounds! I was determined to win. I was invited to a Challenge Group, too, and thats where it all began to make sense.  I met people like me, supporters, and I had accountability , not just at school, but every night I was posting in this group and getting suggestions and encouragement. Between the group, the school, and my willingness to change,  I had a great transformation.   Hib Hop Abs is fun and it doesnt really feel like you are working out , but youre building your body stronger each time you do it. I can do everything now, and more. I even became a Turbo Kick Instructor, Im currently practicing handstands and staying up for a few seconds! My goal is to walk with my hands holding up my body.  Now, I love life, I love the way I look and feel , and Im always looking to trying on new clothes, going out on an adventure, and helping others feel the same way I do.     You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Buffet Style Meal Prep for Spring
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/buffet-style-meal-prep-for-spring,"If you meal prep, then you know how time-saving it can be to have several days worth of meals already stacked away in your fridge or freezer. And if you dont yet meal prep, it probably looks like something helpful you want to try, or like a nightmare of plastic containers and a mess to clean up in the kitchen that is best suited for people with too much free time on their hands. If youre in the latter group, this simplified, buffet-style meal prep might be the antidote to your meal prep fears.   Our resident meal prep master, Social Media Manager Amanda Meixner , is a pro at coming up with colorful menus that follow the Portion Fix container system. But, she has an active social life and her weekends are often filled with adventurous fitness pursuits and travel. Sometimes, theres just not enough time on Sunday afternoon for her usual elaborate meal prep.   She spent this past weekend poolside and exercising in the sunshine in Palm Springs. When she got home, she didnt skip her meal prep, she just simplified it. She took advantage of fresh spring produce, adding artichokes, whole baby zucchini, and mangoes to her menu that also included some of her favorite staples. After a quick trip to the supermarket, she cooked four types of protein, and steamed some vegetables, and put together some of her favorite raw fruits and veggies for snacks. Then, during the week, she mixed and matched these prepared foods to make colorful meals that were different every day.   Its easier than it sounds, and you can do it too with the handy step-by-step guide and grocery list included below. Scroll to see what meals she created from the buffet style meal prep.   Depending on your goals and how many calories you strive to eat each day, you might need more, or less, food than Amanda, who eats at the 1,5001,800 calorie level. You can increase the amounts of her foods, or add some of your favorites. Thats one of the beauties of buffet-style meal prep  you can add or subtract whatever you like.   If this buffet-style meal prep still looks too involved, or youve only got half an hour to pull something together, use this simple menu as inspiration, and shop for a variety of precooked foods. You can buy a rotisserie chicken, canned lentils or beans, salad greens and raw veggies, some whole fruits, Greek yogurt, cottage cheese, or hummus. Then, cook just one other meat, like ground turkey with spices, or  poach salmon  and steam a vegetable.      Here is what Amandas springtime buffet-style meal prep looks like:     This week Amanda is eating:   Proteins  baked chicken breasts  baked salmon  sauted shrimp  hard-boiled eggs   Shakeology   Vegetables  raw baby carrots  mini bell peppers  cauliflower rice  sauted brussels sprouts  steamed baby zucchini  steamed artichokes  steamed broccolini   Fruits  mangoes  bananas(not shown)  mixed berries(not shown)   Carbs  lentils  baked sweet potatoes  edamame  oatmeal (not shown)   Healthy fats  avocados  hummus   Seeds/oils  balsamic vinaigrette dressing      With buffet-style meal prep, every meal can have variety. Mix and match the foods you want, when you want them. Heres how Amanda combined these prepared foods into three different lunches:     Meal 1:  cup raw mini bell peppers,  cup steamed broccolini,  cup steamed baby zucchini,  cup shrimp,and 1 cup sliced mango (Portion Fix containers = 2+ greens, 1 purple,1 red, 2 tsp.)        Meal 2: 1 cup raw mini bell peppers, cupsteamed broccolini,  cup roasted brussels sprouts, 3 oz. baked salmon (Portion Fix containers = 2+ greens, 1 red, 2 tsp.)        Meal 3:  cup raw mini bell peppers, 1cupsteamed broccolini,  cup cooked lentils, cup cauliflower rice with veggies, 3 oz. baked chicken breast(Portion Fix containers = 2 greens, 1 red, 2 yellows, 2 tsp.)      Follow these simple steps to make Amandas buffet-style meal prep:   1.  First, roast the sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts. Turn on your oven to 375 F. Scrub two sweet potatoes and place on a baking large sheet. Wash a bag of brussels sprouts and arrange on the same baking sheet. Drizzle sprouts with two teaspoons olive oil. After 20 minutes, remove the brussels sprouts. Return the baking sheet to the oven and cook the sweet potatoes about 20 minutes more, or until they pierce easily with a fork. When cool, place sweet potatoes and brussels sprouts in the refrigerator.   2.  Next  bake chicken breasts . On a second baking sheet or dish, arrange 1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts. Drizzle each with 1 tsp. olive oil and season with salt, pepper, and any herbs or spices you like. Place baking dish in the oven for 1520 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink in the middle and juices run clear. Let cool for 20 minutes, then place in refrigerator.   3.  Place 8 eggs in saucepan and add enough water to cover the eggs by one inch. Bring water just to a boil over high heat. Remove from heat, cover, and let stand for 12 minutes. While eggs cook, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Carefully remove the eggs from the hot water with a slotted spoon and transfer to the ice water. Place in refrigerator.   4.  Next,  poach salmon filets . Place 1 lb. of salmon filets in baking dish (skin-side down if it has skin). Drizzle with fresh herbs if you have them, lemon juice, and season with salt and pepper. Add water to submerge salmon halfway. Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and bake for 18 to 22 minutes, or until salmon flakes easily when tested with a fork. Thinner filets will cook faster, so start checking the fish after 15 minutes.   5.  Bring water to a boil in a large pot with a steaming basket. Place two artichokes in the basket, with the stems pointing up, and cover the pot with a lid. Cook until tender when the base is pierced with a knife, about 3045 minutes. Remove artichokes from the steamer basket, but leave the heat on. Allow the artichokes to cool, then place them in the refrigerator.   6.  Place broccolini in steamer basket. While broccolini cooks, prepare a large bowl of ice water. Steam broccolini until cooked to your liking, about 45 minutes. Remove it from the steamer basket, but leave the heat on. Let the broccolini cool, and then place in the refrigerator.   7.  Repeat the above steps with the whole baby zucchini or chopped large zucchini. Cook whole baby zucchini for 34 minutes, or chopped zucchini for 12 minutes, or until done to your liking. Turn off heat. Let the zucchini cool, and then place in the refrigerator.   8.  Next saut the cauliflower rice. If you bought cauliflower florets instead of pre-cut cauliflower rice, place them in a food processor and pulse until the cauliflower resembles rice. Heat 2 tsp. olive oil in a saut pan over medium heat. Add mixed pre-chopped vegetables or frozen vegetable which have been thawed. Cook the vegetables for 23 minutes until just soft. Add cauliflower rice and cook 12 minutes more. Season with salt and pepper if desired.   9.  Clean the saut pan you just used, and place it on a burner over medium heat. Add 2 tsp. olive oil and add 1 lb. peeled cocktail shrimp. Cook for 23 minutes, stirring frequently, until the shrimp is pink and opaque. Season with salt and pepper or a spice blend if desired. Let the shrimp cool for 20 minutes, then place in the fridge.   10.  Amanda makes her oatmeal each morning, cooking  cup dry old fashioned rolled oats in 1 cup water. If you prefer to cook your oatmeal ahead of time, heat 5 cups water to a boil over medium heat. Add a pinch of salt if desired. Add 2 cups oats, turn heat to medium-low, and cook, stirring frequently, for 3 to 5 minutes. Set aside to cool. When oatmeal has cooled, divide evenly between five food storage containers (about 1 cup oatmeal each).   11.  Peel and slice four mangoes. Place in refrigerator.   12.  Place frozen, shelled edamame in a food storage container. Place in refrigerator.   13.  Place pre-cooked or canned lentils in a food storage container. Place in refrigerator.      Grocery List for this Buffet-Style Meal Prep   Proteins:  1 lb. salmon  1 lb. boneless, skinless chicken breasts  1 lb. shrimp  1 dozen eggs  Shakeology   Vegetables:  2 containers broccolini (or broccoli)  2 containers Brussel sprouts  2 bags baby carrots  1 bag mini bell peppers  1 package fresh Asian-style vegetable mix  1 bag cauliflower rice(or 1 small cauliflower)  2 cartons mini zucchini  2 medium artichokes  2 large sweet potatoes  2 medium avocados  1 carton edamame(or 1 bag frozen edamame)   Fruits:  4 medium mangoes  8 small bananas  3 cartons mixed berries   Dry Goods:  2 cups old-fashioned rolled oats (not shown)  Raw almonds  Olive oil  Paprika   Prepared Foods:  Hummus  2 packages cooked lentils (or 2 cans lentils)  Balsamic vinaigrette"

Warm Asparagus and White Bean Salad
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/warm-asparagus-and-white-bean-salad-recipe,"Spring vegetables pair with creamy avocado and white beans to make this show-stopper of a salad that is beautiful enough for an elegant brunch and simple enough to be part of your next meal prep. Sauted garlic and lemon zest give it bold flavor, so a little fresh lemon juice is the only dressing it needs. We topped it with chopped pistachios to add crunch and for their lovely green hue.   Look for bright green, tender stalks of asparagus with tightly closed tips. Avoid asparagus that looks limp or bruised or has woody stems. If you dont plan to cook your asparagus immediately, chop about an inch off the bottom of each stalk and wrap the cut ends in a damp paper towel, then store in a plastic bag in the refrigerator. Young, thin asparagus will work best in this quickly cooked recipe. If you buy thicker asparagus, you may want to add an additional minute or two to the cooking time.   Pea tendrils contribute an additional element of springs bounty to this salad. Pea tendrils (or pea shoots) are the new leaves and vining stems of pea plants. They taste mildly like peas, but also have floral notes and crunch that can take the place of lettuce. They are traditionally available only in spring, but some farms are now growing sprouts year-round. If you cant find them at your market, substitute watercress or baby spinach to enjoy this salad any time.   This delicious asparagus and white bean salad is served warm, but can also be made ahead and served chilled. It is a perfect side dish for chicken or fish, and with 9 grams of protein and fiber, is hearty enough to be eaten as a vegetarian main course. If you are making it ahead of time, or for meal prep, add the avocado just before serving.            Warm Asparagus and White Bean Salad   Total Time:  14 min.   Prep Time:  10 min.   Cooking Time:  4 min.   Yield:  4 servings   Ingredients:  2 tsp. olive oil  1 bunch asparagus, cut into 1-inch pieces (about 12 spears)  2 cloves garlic, finely chopped  1 cup canned white beans (or cannellini beans or navy beans), drained, rinsed  1 cup pea tendrils (or watercress or baby spinach)  1 medium avocado, chopped  20 raw pistachios, chopped  2 Tbsp. fresh lemon juice  1 tsp. finely grated lemon peel (lemon zest)   Preparation:  1. Heat oil in medium nonstick skillet over medium heat.  2. Add asparagus; cook, stirring frequently, for 2 to 3 minutes, or until asparagus is tender-crisp.  3. Add garlic; cook, stirring frequently, for 1 minute.  4. Place asparagus mixture, beans, pea tendrils, avocado, pistachios, lemon juice, and lemon peel in a medium bowl; toss gently to blend.  5. Divide evenly between four serving bowls.   Tip:  Pea tendrils are also called pea shoots. They are the early stems of the pea plant. If you cant find them, or dont grow them, use watercress or baby spinach.

Although I felt healthier, I still didnt see how this was going to become a forever change. I wanted more than weight loss. More than a diet. I wanted a complete lifestyle change and whole new way of living. I wanted to be toned, fit, and only eat what my body needednot what my head wanted. I wanted to cut out sugar and empty carbs and fill it with fresh fruits and vegetables. I was feeling like I needed more, I just didnt know what that more was until my wonderful aunt (and now Coach!) filled me in on the Beachbody program. Now I am hooked and I have made it my passion in life to help others discover the amazing-ness that is Beachbody!   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  After an intense three years full of moving from another state, having two children, becoming a stay-at-home-mom, breaking my leg, and buying a house, I felt lost. I felt like I had gotten swallowed up in pizza and chocolate and laying on the couch and watching TV and I felt awful. I wasnt taking care of myself and I was losing all that makes me who I am. I was spending so much energy on my kids, my house, my husband, his new job, and everything else, that I forgot to take care of myself. I packed on a ton of weight and felt absolutely horrible. I kept justifying it since I just had a baby or I just broke my leg or we didnt have enough money for a treadmill, but by doing that I really let myself down. My weight creeped up into the 360sand that was post-pregnancy!and I was ashamed. Ashamed of my 4x and 5x shirts not fitting, ashamed I was outgrowing Lane Bryant clothes and was going to have to start shopping online for bigger clothes, ashamed of my grocery cartI needed a change.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  People have always told me that I have a pretty face. It may sound silly, but I hate that sentence. It just makes me feel as if they are really saying, well your face is nice, but the rest of your body is a hot mess. And I think I hated it so much because it was true. I felt awful about myself and struggled with my self-esteem. It affected my marriage and other relationships. I would be jealous of my husbands co-workers and feel envious when I saw friends online losing weight. I would justify it by listing all the wonderful things that I had in my life: my husband, my children, my house, wonderful friends, but I realized I could never really appreciate all of those things without being happy first with myself. Losing weight during the 21 Day Fix has helped my confidence tremendously and therefor has made me a better mom, a better wife, and a better friend. It has inspired me to become a Coach and bring this amazing feeling I now have to others and I am now living the perfect life! Beachbody was the puzzle piece my life was missing for 28 years!   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  21 days! It seems so quick and easy! I love the short time frame and the intense amount of activity and healthy eating that is crammed into those short three weeks. When I first heard about it I thought, I could eat well for three weeks and now that those three weeks have passed (plus another 21 weeks on top of that!), Im always ready for the next three! It provides an opportunity for short-term goals, which are essential in building a long-term lifestyle! I am still obsessed with my Shakeology that I used as a meal-replacer every single day since August and cannot wait to get my golden scoop! It makes me feel healthy, full, and alert. Plus I poop every day! That may be way too much information, but before the Shakeology came into my life, I was beyond irregular and uncomfortable.   I cant imagine starting a morning without Autumn, or Shaun T, or the Beast and my Shakeology!   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I honestly am in shock at my results. I had been working out and calorie counting for a few months previous to the 21 Day Fix and was able to lose 34 pounds during those 10 weeks, but in the last six months with Beachbody, I have now lost an additional 81 pounds! It has been astronomically, amazingly life changing! I love the workouts ranging from 21 Day Fix, to TurboJam, to Hammer and Chisel, and INSANITY MAX:30. With the help of the trainers, I am stronger, more flexible, and I have improved my overall endurance. I was able to complete my very first 5k run, as well as 2 more, after starting with Beachbody and ran my most recent one in record time! I also was able to start wearing clothes that havent fit me in over 10+ years  and  surpassed my 100 pound goal marker! I began as a miserable, unhealthy, unmotivated size 32 and am now a happy, radiant, optimistic, healthy size 18! My confidence is off the roof and made me so proud! But not only has my life changed, but now as a Coach, I work every single day to help others to do the same! My husband has lost over 40 pounds and my challengers have lost a combined total of over 200 pounds!     How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I truthfully dont even know where to begin to answer this question. My life is 100% different today than it was just eight months ago. Not only am I thinner, healthier, more confident, and overall happierbut so is my family. To watch my sweet boys and my amazing husband learn better eating habits, work out alongside of me, and have more energy is just so heartwarming. Being a mom of two young children and watching them change as I change has been one of the most rewarding parts of starting my new life with Beachbody and I cant even fathom where we were heading before I made the choice to start the Fix back on August.My boys were couch potatoes and now they do sit ups with me, I was lonely as a stay at home mom and now I have this amazing community of Coaches and challengers that I surround myself daily, my once lazy husband wakes me up to work out, and I truthfully could just go on and on. I am thankful for Beachbody and all it has given me every sine day of my life.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  My beautiful aunt, who also is my fearless Coach, puts herself out there every day on our Challenge Group page. She shows her ups and downs and encourages us to share ours as well. Her videos, motivational quotes, and recipes always keep me excited whenever I get a notification saying something was posted. Ive tried many new recipes that she recommended as well as ones from other members. Ive made new friends and learned so much about other women who all live different lives, yet we have our Challenge Group as common ground and we all are striving daily for the same thing. Every week we cheer each other on for our weight losses and applaud our workouts and critique our daily logs to see where we could do better, what was good, and get new ideas for foods to fill our containers. It is truly a major part of my success so far and I am looking forward to creating my own.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  My Coach has been there all along. She has told me from Day one that I needed to become a Coach and has supported me in everything Ive done. She has offered advice, recipes, motivational quotes, fun videos, and all the tools to help me train for my own business. She is always striving to better herself and inspire others to take action as well. My Coach is one of the busiest women I have ever met, but she is always there with an answer or funny quip when I need it. Shes the best and I could not have made it to where I am now without her funny videos, photos, and posts on our page as well as our many silly texting conversations. She was a huge fan of mine when I ran my 5k and helped me come up with a workout plan to incorporate running with the 21 Day Fix program. She rocks!   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  I love me my Shakeology! Yum yum yum! I tried a few of the recipes, but still come back to my plain chocolate shake. It is beyond delicious and I have it every day after my morning workout. I truthfully go to bed at night looking forward to my workout being over in the morning so I can savor my yummy chocolate Shakeology! I always thought people who drank protein shakes were a bit odd, especially when they said they actually tasted good, but now I am that person who takes me shaker cup with me whenever I have plans so I can still have my treat. I dont drink it out of obligation, but out of love! It has deceased my sugar and chocolate cravings massively and holds me over for a few hours! It is filling, delicious, and energizing. I dont even need my coffee in the mornings anymore since I have my Shakeology! I cant say enough good things about it and I have been recommending it to everyone I know!   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Here are the meals youll eat on Tuesday and Thursday.     YOUR STEP-BY-STEP STRATEGIC GUIDE TO PREPARING YOUR PREP QUICKLY:   1.Deploying the right equipment will make this advanced meal preparedness more efficient. A ricecooker or multi-cooker with a porridge settingwill make it easy to cook oatmeal without having to stand at attention while the pot boils.If you do not have a rice cooker or multi-cooker, itcan be cooked on the stovetop. Cook 2cups steel cut oats in 6cups water. When cooked, stir in 3 Tbsp. plus 1 tsp. nut butter and 2 tsp. cinnamon. Divide cooked oats evenly between five food containers, placing about 1 cup oatmeal in each. Set aside to cool.   2.Heat oven to 375 F. Coat two baking sheets with nonstick spray. Wash 25asparagus spears, then chop about two inches off the ends and discard ends. Place asparagus on one baking sheet, season with salt and pepper if desired. Place asparagus in the oven for 1015 minutes or until tender. Asparagus will be eaten with breakfasts. Divide evenly between oatmeal containers, or place in separate containers and refrigerate. Peel three sweet potatoes and chop into bite-sized pieces. Place sweet potatoes on second on baking sheet and season with salt and pepper if desired. Bake sweet potatoes for 10 minutes. Stir, and then cook 10 minutes more, or until tender when pierced with a fork. Set sweet potatoes aside. Leave oven on.   3. Crack 20 eggs into a large bowl and scramble with a whisk. Heat a large pan over medium low heat. Spray with nonstick cooking spray. Add eggs and turn heat to low. Cook, stirring constantly until eggs begin to set. Remove from heat when just cooked but still very soft. They will cook morewhen reheated. Remove eggs from pan and allow to cool completely. Divide eggs evenly between five small containers or plastic bags. Place in freezer. When ready to eat, reheat in the microwave for 2 minutes or more as needed. Serve with oatmeal, asparagus, and 1 cup fresh berries.   4. Next, cook the salmon. Heat a large pan over medium heat. Rinse and pat dry 1 lb.of salmon. Season with salt and pepper. Spray pan with nonstick cooking spray. Place salmon in pan. Cook for 34 minutes, then flip and cook 34 minutes more, or until fish flakes easily with a fork. Remove from pan and set aside to cool. When fish has cooled, prepare two food containers each with 2 cups spinach. Place a piece of salmon in each container. Add 1 cup sweet potatoes to each container. Place in refrigerator.   5. Make the Honey Mustard Sauce and add cayenne pepper to turn up the heat (and crank up your metabolism). In a small bowl combine  cup yogurt, 3 Tbsp. Dijon mustard, 3 Tbsp. honey, 3 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar,  cup extra-virgin olive oil, a dash of cayenne, and salt and pepper to taste. Mix well. Serve with salmon, arugula, and sweet potato bites.   6. Prepare to bake fish in foil packets, a foolproof way to get moist, flaky results every time. While vegetables roast, lay out three 20-inchsheets of aluminum foil. Cutthree zucchini and three summer squash into  inch thickslices. Distributesquash evenly on each sheet offoil and drizzle each with 1 tsp. coconut oil. Rinse and pat dry 24 oz. of tilapia. Top each mound of vegetables with eight ounces of tilapia. Season with curry powder, salt, and pepper (if desired). Top fish with lemon slices. Fold foil around fish and vegetables to form a tightly sealed packet. Place packets on a baking sheet and bake for 20 minutes, or until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 20 minutes. Open foil packets, to arrest the cooking process. Transfer fish and vegetables to food storage containers. When cool, place in refrigerator.   7. Next, make the bison burgers and sauted mushrooms. Place 1 lb. ground bison in a medium bowl. Season  tsp. chili powder,  tsp. cumin,  tsp. onion powder, tsp. garlic powder,salt, and pepper and mix well. Evenly divide bison into two portions, and shape into burger patties. Heat a pan over medium heat, then spray with nonstick cooking spray. Cook burger patties for 56 minutes per side, or until desired temperature is reached. Set aside. Clean pan with a paper towel and spray with more nonstick spray. Add two chopped shallots and cook, stirring frequently for 12 minutes until shallots start to soften, being careful not to burn shallots. Remove shallots from pan and set aside. Add two 8-oz. packages of sliced mushrooms and 3 sprigs of fresh thyme to the same pan and cook, stirring occasionally until mushrooms are golden brown. When mushrooms are cooked, add cooked shallots, two tablespoons sherry vinegar and as much chopped parsley as you like and stir to combine. Divide mushrooms evenly between two food containers. Top with burger patties. When cool, place in refrigerator.   8. Prepare three large food containers for the Southwestern Spinach Salad. Fill each container with 1 cup spinach. Place 8 oz. cooked chicken breast on top of spinach. In a medium bowl combine a can of black beans, 1 cups frozen corn, and 1 cups cherry tomatoes cut in half, 1 cups chopped bell pepper, 1 jalapeo, 3 chopped green onions, and as much cilantro (or parsley) as you want. Stir to combine. Top salads with bean mixture, dividing evenly between each container.   9. To make the Avocado Dressing, place avocado,  cup yogurt, 1 clove garlic, 1 Tbsp. red onion (or shallot), 1 Tbsp. lemon juice, and 9 sprigs of parsley in a blender; cover. Blend until smooth. Serve this dressing with the Southwestern Spinach Salad.   10. Remove the stems from 5 cups strawberries and slice. Divide strawberries evenly between 5 containers. Top each container with  cup goat cheese (or feta). Place in refrigerator. When ready to eat, drizzle each with 1 tsp. balsamic vinegar. This tastes even better with aged balsamic vinegar, which is sweeter and thick like syrup.   11. Crack 20 eggs into a large bowl and scramble with a whisk. Heat a large pan over medium low heat. Spray with nonstick cooking spray. Add eggs and turn heat to low. Cook, stirring constantly until eggs begin to set. Remove from heat when just cooked but still very soft.

When ready to eat, reheat in the microwave for 2 minutes or more as needed. Serve with oatmeal, asparagus, and 1 cup fresh berries.   12. Divide frozen peaches and pineapple between 5 plastic bags, placing 1 cup of fruit in each bag. Return fruit to freezer. These perfectly portioned bags are ready to make delicious Shakeology smoothies.

Avocado Egg Salad Toast
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/avocado-egg-salad-toast-recipe,"Egg salad is one of those tricky foods that seems healthy. Its made from eggs and its got the word salad right there in the name, but mayonnaise is the glue that holds it together and turns it into the creamy spread you know and love.   But you know what makes a great substitution for mayo? Mashed avocado. It provides the same creamy texture, with a healthy dose of monounsaturated fat (thats the good kind) and gives you another twist on avocado toast. We added lemon juice to bring a touch of bright acidity to the dish and to help prevent the avocado from turning brown.   To add a finishing touch to this dish, we topped the Egg Salad Avocado Toast with a small handful of watercress, the delicate leaves and crunchy stems of which add a peppery flavor. Watercress is so good for you, it earned the top spot as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention s most nutrient-dense fruit or vegetable most strongly associated with reduced chronic disease risk. Looks like those Brits were onto something with their tea sandwiches. If you cant find watercress, substitute arugula or baby spinach, which also made the list.   Here are a few other variations to try: Dress up the avocado egg salad with some fresh, cracked pepper or a sprinkle of smoked paprika. Cut up some cherry tomatoes, green onions, or jalapeo slices and throw them into the mix. Swap out the toast for a whole grain tortilla and top it with salsa. Skip the toast and dip into the salad with whole grain crackers, endive leaves, or celery stalks. Going grainless? Enjoy it in lettuce cups!   Let us know how you enjoy your Egg Salad Avocado Toast and # your finished recipes with #BeachbodyBlog. We cant wait to see what you come up with.     Avocado Egg Salad Toast   Total Time: 10 min.   Prep Time: 10 min.

Fitspiration Friday: I Had Gained More Than 70 Pounds Thanks to Fertility Treatments and Hormone Swings
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/womens-results/fitspiration-friday-i-had-gained-more-than-70-pounds-thanks-to-fertility-treatments-and-hormone-swings,"If youve tried a Beachbody program, youve probably had a goal in mind that you wanted to achieve. Maybe you wanted to lose weight. Maybe you wanted to get stronger. Maybe you wanted to improve your health. Maybe it was a mix of allthree,or something else entirely. But, along the way, no matter what your goal, everyone needs a little inspiration. Every other Friday, the Beachbody Success Stories team will share inspirational fitness stories from some of the folks who have done Beachbody programs. Maybe one will inspire you!   Meet Sandra. After years of fertility treatments and miscarriages, Sandra had gained more than 70 pounds and couldnt seem to shed it.   At 35, I was very fit. But, in my 40s, I gained more than 70 pounds trying to have a baby. Five miscarriages and wild hormone swings from shots, pregnancies and IUIattempts, packed on the pounds. I worked out religiously, weight trained with a trainer twice a week and did 45 minutes to an hour of cardio three times a week. But nothing worked. Even though I was on a diet of 1200 calories (or fewer).   Every doctor I spoke with wanted to put me on diabetic medications or treat the symptoms, not find the cause. I looked for answers from every type of doctor and fitness specialist. I spent thousands on supplements and blood tests. Nothing helped.   Finally, in October 2014, I found a doctor that adjusted my hormones and the symptoms and illnesses went away. I finally felt like my body would meet me halfway, and I might see some results.   Despite the extra weight, I was in pretty good cardio health. My main issue was my back hurt from the excess weight in my chest, and my hips and knees ached from carrying it all. I was embarrassed when I saw pictures of myself because that was not how I saw myself and not how I wanted my daughter to know me. In December2014we took a family photo shoot in Cancun and I loved all the pictures of the family except for how large I looked. I was stunned. it was not who I saw in the mirror every day.     Last January, I met one of my best friends in Las Vegas for the weekend.Herand her husband had done 21 Day Fix and were working on P90X3 with great results. She observed that I didnt eat much and she knew I worked out all the time. She encouraged me to try 21 Day Fix because she knew the diet would fit my busy work schedule. I have to eat at my desk because I manage money and trade stocks, so I dont leave my desk from market open to market close. The containers were a great way to get my eating organized and the program wasnt intimidating. Id prep food on Sunday for the week and fill my containers the night before so there was no excuse for not taking my lunch. For five weeks, I did 21 Day Fix and did an additional 45 minutes of cardio on the weekdays. I lost 15 pounds.   This encouraged me to step it up with 21 Day Fix Extreme . So, for the next 12 weeks, I committed to that program (along with additional cardio on the weekdays). I was down 44 pounds! My friend encouraged me to try P90X3. I loved it and finished that down 53 pounds. I am not yet at my goal weight, but my initial goal was to lose 50 pounds by my 50th birthday and I achieved that goal! I celebrated with a new bikini and a trip to Cancun with my best friend.   This past fall, I tried out new workouts in Beachbody On Demand . I started The Masters Hammer & Chisel with my friend on December 14th together and every time we get together we work out in the mornings. Its become our thing and its so much fun. Even though I have to get up at 4:15 AM to get my workouts in and get to the gym to do my 45 minutes of cardio, I fit it in. I am now down 58 pounds and wearing a size 10 Petite.   I have a beautiful 6-year-old daughter that we adopted at birth. She works out with me every weekend, and on someweekdaysshe crawls out of bed and joins me, even if it is just to watch. She is a great comic relief and is quick to point out if my form is not quite as good as Autumns, Tonys, or Sagis.   This month was my one year anniversary of starting this journey and Ive been reflecting and celebrating the successes. I am so happy to have the old me back. I never thought of myself as fat, but pictures dont lie. What is funny is that my lifelong friends look at pictures of me from two years ago and they say they dont remember me that way either."

This Kale Salad Has More Calories Than a Double Big Mac (No, Really)
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/this-kale-salad-has-more-calories-than-a-double-big-mac,"McDonalds recently stepped up their salad game, adding a kale salad to its Canadian menu. When we first got wind of the Keep Calm, Caesar On salad, we were curious  after all, it was only a year ago that McDs was  throwing shade at kale  in a Big Mac commercial.   The  official nutritional numbers  for the kale salad took us by surprise. Turns out, you might actually be better off sticking with a burger  even the four-patty Double Big Mac.   The kale-based Caesar salad with crispy chicken, clocks in at 520 calories, 31 grams of fat, and 1,140 grams of sodium. And thats before you add the asiago dressing, which adds another 210 calories and 22 grams of fat. The grand total is 730 calories, 53 grams of fat, and 1,400 grams of sodium (about the same as Burger Kings Bacon Chicken Ranch Salad or Wendys Spicy Chicken Caesar Salad). It is also available with grilled chicken, though the website does not include the nutritional information for that option. By comparison, the Double Big Mac  which includes four beef patties  has 680 calories, 38 grams of fat, and 1,340 milligramsof sodium.   The salad is also loaded with vague-sounding ingredients like flavor, color, and microbial enzyme. (Yum?) And the crispy chicken alone contains more than 15 ingredients. When youre looking at a food product, look at the ingredients, says Denis Faye, MS, Senior Director of Nutrition Content for Beachbody. Ideally, a salad should be made from whole ingredients  such as veggies, beans, seeds, oil, and vinegar.   So why would McDonalds bother adding kale to its menu if theyre going to smother it with crispy chicken, cheesy croutons, and bacon? Most likely, they dont want to lose their more health-conscious customers. Theres a lot of pressure on fast food chains to health up, Faye says. But even though salad might seem like a healthier option than a quadruple cheeseburger, its really not a game-changer. In fact, the fact that this calorie-bomb takes the form of a salad makes it almost worse. The salad has some greens, Faye notes, but if you look at a burger, you have a little lettuce and tomato on there. Its the same thing, but not in sheeps clothing. Its okay to occasionally eat fast food, Faye adds. But dont fool yourself into thinking this is a healthy meal.   So if youre jonesing for a burger, you might as well order a burger, because the Caesar salad wont satisfy your cravings or save you any calories. If youre trying to take baby steps towards healthier eating habits, a better bet would be to order a cheeseburger with a side garden salad instead of fries, opt for balsamic vinaigrette, and only use half the dressing. That will give you a fast food splurge with a side of actual veggies, and your total caloric intake will only be 390 calories. And best of all, your diet wont have been derailed by a cheat meal in disguise.   Or, hey, try  this healthier version  of a classic Caesar."

Fitspiration Friday: 21 Day Fix Helped Me Regain My Confidence and Strength
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/fitspiration-friday-21-day-fix-helped-me-regain-my-confidence-and-strength,"If youve tried a Beachbody program, youve probably had a goal in mind that you wanted to achieve. Maybe you wanted to lose weight. Maybe you wanted to get stronger. Maybe you wanted to improve your health. Maybe it was a mix of all three, or something else entirely. But, along the way, no matter what your goal, everyone needs a little inspiration. Every other Friday, the Beachbody Success Stories team will share inspirational fitness stories from some of the folks who have done Beachbody programs. Maybe one will inspire you!   Meet Jennifer. A few years ago, she experienced major strokes and brain aneurysms that changed her life. After an amazing recovery, the 21 Day Fix helped her regain both confidence and strength.               I am recovering from two massive strokes and seven brain aneurysms that happened on June 30, 2008. My right side is still very weak from it. I was totally paralyzed on my right side. I couldnt sit up, talk, walk, eat, or do anything for myself. That July, at the age of 26, I moved into a nursing home and stayed there until I checked myself out in October. There, I relearned to talk, relearned to how to walk and went to speech, physical, and occupational therapy every day. It felt hopeless, and I feared my life as I had known it was over. I felt like a baby trapped in an adults body. On top of this, I had a three and a five-year-old. But, the only way out of there was through intensive physical and occupational therapy and willpower. I also had to be vulnerable and give it to God and let Him take care of everything. It was the hardest, darkest time in my life.       Outside the nursing home.       At one point, I was cleared by my doctor to work out. My physical therapist had a gym at the office, and he always encouraged me to work out. I was scared to sit on a stationary bike because I thought I might fall. Plus, I was only able to ride it for a few minutes. I also couldnt move the first weights on the equipment. In fact, I was so weak, I could barely open the door to the gym. But I kept going back and kept working at it, getting stronger and stronger as the years passed. But, I felt less than the other people I worked out around. I felt I needed a nutrition makeover. I was tired and irritable from a poor diet. I didnt know that then, but its very apparent to me now.     I felt like  21 Day Fix  would be a good change up to my regular workout routine because I had felt like I was spinning my wheels and not getting traction. I also knew I wasnt eating right for the work I was putting in and I had no idea how to change it. I would work out at the gym and then go to KFC. I knew I was sabotaging myself and that something had to give. My Beachbody coach told me how well  Shakeology  was working for her, and she told me about the 21 Day Fix. It took me a few months to convince myself, but I finally took the plunge.     I loved Autumns encouraging, motivating way of training. I loved being in a group that held me accountable for my actions. My goal was to get healthier, but I got so much more. I was amazed at how much I could eat and lose weight. I was astonished that the 30-minute workouts that felt more effective than my usual two-and-a-half hours at the local gym. I loved that I quickly saw real results, and I loved how much healthier I felt all around.     The 21 Day Fix melted fat off my body that I didnt even know I had. It revealed healthy, lean muscle that I worked so hard for in the gym, but I could never fully see it. It changed my body by helping me lose that few extra pounds. I now have greater range of motion with my arm, shoulder, and leg on my weak side. I also found out I can do jumping jacks. I ran for the first time since my stroke! I am so incredibly proud of that! Running was my thing before my stroke and I did it again! I learned my weak side is much more capable than I ever thought. I feel healthier than I ever have in my entire life.     Recently, I moved to California to explore, mountain climb, snowboard, swim in the rivers and lakes, wakeboard, and to truly enjoy my life. I am going to continue to get healthier and stronger so I can do all of those things. My kids deserve to have a capable Mommy who can keep up with all the things they love to do. I am going to participate in my first 5K walk. My goal is to be able to run the length of the road I live on down and back, which would be about a 1/4 mile, by the end of the year. My ultimate goal is to run marathons. Running is what makes me feel free. Everything God gave me when he made me is still inside of me, I just have to learn how to free it all.   On a difficult hike in San Francisco.   Thanks to Beachbody, I am learning to stand in my power, as Sagi Kalev always says.My doctors are amazed at how much better I keep getting but I never give up. Even if I couldnt hold a weight during Upper Fix, I never stopped moving or trying. I will master it someday. When my mind wants to quit, my heart keeps me going. I want my life back and working out is the only way to get there. I actually feel like Im on the road to a long, happy, healthy life. Ive found what I love, what I have passion for, and it has lead me to my purpose.. to help other people achieve their goals."

We even made a contest out of it, offering free shirts for all qualifying contestantsanda total of $30,000 in prize money for the top 10 transformation stories (all achieved in 52 days or less). Without further ado,  behold  the winners of the Year-End Resolution Challenge!   Jessica B. lost 20 pounds in 33 days with 21 Day Fix EXTREME +  Shakeology , and she won $5,000!     I knew after having a baby, the weight wouldnt just fall off on its own. After years of frustration with my weight and not wanting to go through one more holiday feeling uncomfortable in pictures, I entered a Beachbody Challenge Group after Thanksgiving and for the first time in my life, I feel like I have finally learned how to successfully lead a healthy lifestyle through exercise and healthy diet. The 21 Day Fix EXTREMEprogram and Shakeology taught me how to eat healthy without feeling deprived and how to work out effectively to produce amazing results. I lost 16 pounds and 16 inches in 21 days and am currently down 20 pounds and 20 inches in 33 days. I cant believe I could have these results in a month! Im only 10 pounds away from my wedding weight and couldnt be more thrilled that I did it before the end of 2015! I have never felt this amazing, and its a lifestyle that easily fits into my life as a wife, mom, and NICU RN.     Barbara S. (age 51) lost7 pounds in 2 rounds of the 21 Day Fix +  Shakeology ! She won $4,000.     This was a great experience. I completed 21 Day Fix (twice) and started using Shakeology with great results. I lost 7 pounds and hit my overall goal weight. I will be continuing another round of 21 Day Fix! I love it! Looking forward to the New Year and my 52nd birthday. The best I have ever felt! Thank you! Thanks Autumn and all at Beachbody. Best of health in 2016.     Ngozi N. lost 10.4 pounds in just over 1 month with 21 Day Fix, 3-Day Refresh, Shakeology, and Beachbody Performance supplements. She won $3,000.     I loved the idea of going into the holiday season armed with a Year-End Resolution.During this challenge I was determined not to miss any of my workouts and follow my nutrition plan as closely as possible. I drank Vegan Tropical Strawberry  Shakeology  every day and followed the 21 Day Fix program and nutrition plan along with the  3-Day Refresh . I also had  Beachbody Performance  Energize before every workout. I amazed myself by losing 10.4 pounds over the course of just over 1 month! My bloating went down, I felt stronger and had more energy and realized that I still enjoyed the holiday season without sacrificing eating well. I cant say how proud I am that I stuck to my meal plan, because in the past, the holidays were when I would  gain  10 plus pounds back of weight that I had worked all year to lose, and during this challenge, I used  Beachbody On Demand  to eliminate the obstacles and turn that statistic upside down and instead  lose  10.4 pounds and 8.25 inches! I wouldnt have been able to do it without the easy access to the workouts online and the simple nutrition.     Lauren H. lost 8 pounds in 21 days with the 21 Day Fix, and she won $2,000!     My year-end resolution ended perfectly with the 21 Day Fix! I was blown away by how effective the program was for me, and I definitely believe that dialing in on my nutrition was the key to my success. I followed the lowest calorie plan, because my goal was not only to tone up but to lose the excess weight I had put on from stress, depression, and bad eating habits. I lost 8 pounds in just 21 days, and I feel amazing! So much lighter! I lost 4 inches in my hips/lower abdomen and almost 5 inches in my waist, which seems like a lot in 21 days, but I was carrying most of my weight in those areas. I feel like myself again, and my clothes fit so much better. After the Fix, I started using  Beachbody On Demand , because there are hundreds of workouts on there. Beachbody is not only a life-saver but a life-changer, and I am still on the journey!     Kat M. lost 7 pounds in 21 Days with 21 Day Fix EXTREME, and she won $1,000!     I have done just about every Beachbody program that there is, but when I really want to see results, I turn to 21 Day Fix EXTREME. I had done several rounds before, and I knew it was the perfect workout to complete during the Year-End Resolution challenge. I dialed in my nutrition and pushed myself every day. Knowing it was only 30 minutes a day for 21 days continuously motivated me. The results were better than I could have expected! I have more energy, became more toned, and am able to challenge myself more each day. Heres to a healthy and fit 2016!     You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed! Complete any Beachbody program, and enter your results for a free gift and a chance to win cash and prizes.     Johnny M. (age 60) lost 8 pounds in 21 days with the 21 Day Fix, and he won $5,000!     I knew that I was going to be 60 in December 2015, and I wanted to be in the best shape of my life. When I heard about the 21 Day Fix Year-End Resolution Challenge, I jumped at the chance to be held accountable by thousands of like-minded people who were not only motivating, but inspirational. Turning 60 on Day 9 of the 21 Day Fix was challenging for me. My co-workers understood my goal and supported me, but at the same time wanted to acknowledge my birthday, so they got me one single cupcake. It was yummy, but I felt bad cheating. I also cheated at dinner that night. But I knew that I would get back on track by just reading the posting of the many people in the Facebook challenge page. After completing the 21 Days, I felt so much better. I could really see a big difference in my face, and my jeans started fitting like they should.I would also like to give a big shout out to the  Beachbody On Demand . I was able to do my 21 Day Fix in the gym at my complex a few days, giving me more space to work out than just my room, and other equipment.     Ryan H. lost 15 pounds in just over a month with 21 Day Fix EXTREME + some other workouts viaBeachbody On Demand, and he won $4,000!     2015 had been difficult for us, on many levels. I had started off in the best shape, while doing  Body Beast , but I got off track. Life happened. For the Year-End Resolution challenge, I decided to  officially start a program and stick to it 100%, cutting out alcohol, sticking to the meal plan, and completingit from start to finish. So I started 21 Day Fix EXTREME, completed all 21 days and then continued to use those workouts along with some othersvia  Beachbody On Demand , and then I was in greatshape when my wife and I officially started  The Masters Hammer and Chisel  together.     Jerry G. lost 9 pounds in 21 days with 21 Day Fix EXTREME and otherworkouts via Beachbody On Demand. He entered his results and won $3,000!     My Year-End Resolution was to get over the plateau I had hit. I used  Beachbody On Demand  to do a few different workouts (mainly 21 Day Fix EXTREME) to do it.     Kevin E. lost 10.8 pounds in 21 days with 21 Day Fix, and he won $2,000!     As a Beachbody Coach, I have helped dozens of people reach their goals with the 21 Day Fix. However, I myself had never committed to the program. My Year-End Resolution was to create my own Success Story! I committed to doing a round in December. This helped me correct any weight/bloat gained during Thanksgiving and kept me on track during the most tempting month of the year for poor food choices. From my December Fix I lost 10.8 pounds and gained some amazing new muscle definition. For once, I felt like the scale was reflecting the changes I saw in the mirror  Ive never been more proud of myself!     In 21 days with 21 Day Fix EXTREME, Cory D. lost 4 pounds and went from regular to ripped in preparation for the arrival of his newborndaughter.     I really enjoyed the Year-End Resolution Challenge! I loved that it brought a large group of people together to focus on their health and fitness at a time of year when those topics are more often shoved aside in favor of holiday parties & shopping. Personally, I took on a round of 21 Day Fix EXTREME. Its a very tough program, but I knew it would bring results. My 3rd baby was due on the day I finished. Gotta be ready for her! With the help of the Year-End Resolution Challenge accountability group, my own accountability group, and my Beachbody Coach (my wife) I stuck to the workout schedule and  mostly stuck to the nutrition plan as well! I mainly got these workouts done at home, but sometimes my work schedule dictated that I stop by the gym to get my workout in, at which time  Beachbody On Demand  was key. Having the freedom to access the workouts anywhere gave me the necessary flexibility to stick to the program  no matter what!  So, at the end of a tough, soreness-inducing 21 days, I lost 4 pounds, dropped my body fat from 9.1 to 7.5%, gained muscle in my chest while losing 2 inches in my waist (Ill take that trade off!), and felt fit and strong to take on the new year!      You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

10 Tempting Meal Prep Lunches to Take to Work
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/10-tempting-meal-prep-lunches-to-take-to-work,"Theres no reason to order take-out or hit the food truck line with your coworkers when there are so many delicious make-ahead lunches that can be prepped at home, some in a matter of minutes. Not only will brown bagging your lunch help you save a ton of moneyandstay on track with your nutrition goals, the energizing nutrition from healthy ingredients will help you avoid falling into a food coma at your desk. Here are 10 great ideas we found to inspire you.   Want more lunch ideas? Check out these Beachbody-approved soups , salads , and sandwiches .      1. Were suckers for salad jars. They are ideal for meal prep, and the options for filling them are unlimited. Place heavier items and dressing at the bottom of the jar and greensat the top. This tasty vegan combination from @begoochie has, from bottom to top: toasted sunflower seeds, carrot ginger dressing, baby bell peppers, tempeh, chickpeas, tomatoes, carrots, and mixed greens. She calculated the Portion Fix containers to be 1 red, 1 yellow, 1 orange, 2 teaspoons, and 2 greens.        2. We like meatballs for meal prep because one kitchen sessioncan make enough for a week or two of meals. And, its easy to change up the protein, herbs, or sauce in the recipe to keep your menus exciting. Serve them with salad, in soup, in tacos, on zucchini noodles or spaghetti squash, or with roasted veggies like thecombination of brussles sprouts and butternut squash pictured below. These turkey meatballs from @amandaplz88 have a secret ingredient that adds tons of fiber and nutrition. She uses wheat germ instead of bread crumbs to bind everything together. Get her recipe .        3. @brookeellington schicken salad is flavored with lots of fresh herbs, onion, and celery. Its a great way to use extra rotisseriechicken. Go wild with extra veggies like chopped carrot, bell pepper, or fennel and mix in a tablespoon or two of low-fat plain Greek yogurt instead of mayonnaise. Serve with your favorite veggies, like carrot sticks and boiled beets, or scoop the salad into lettuce cups or endive leaves.        4. @danalejandro says it took him just 15 minutes to prepare this impressive meal prep. That makes it a winning recipe we want to try. While quinoa cooks, and salmon bakes, saut green beans, bell peppers, and red onion. When the quinoa is done, stir in garbanzo beans and chopped fresh herbs. Dont want to be that person at work who heats fish in the microwave and makes the whole office smell like bait? This meal can be mixed together and eaten cold as a grain salad.        5. Be the envy of your coworkers at lunchtime with these stuffed bell peppers from the FIXATE cookbook. @coach_wes_gilbert made the filling with ground chicken, quinoa, black beans, corn, tomato sauce, cilantro, lime juice, and a bit of cheese. Get the cookbook .        6. This veggie wrap looks like a creationfrom a fancy juice shop but @kerstingraham perfected it at home. The best part? Theres no cooking required. Her recipe includes 2 collard green leaves, 6 Tbsp of oil-free hummus,  cup shredded carrots,  cup shredded raw beets, and  avocado.        7. A hearty bowl of chili never disappoints, especially when its loaded with aromaticveggies and lean protein. Delicious foods like this are helping @coachchristie730 stick to her nutrition goals. She made this chili from a recipe in the FIXATE cookbook. Dont have the book yet? Try this Turkey Chili recipeor our vegetarian Black Bean Chili .        8. Dont forget to packfruit with your lunch! @koy_enriquez prepares a selection of seasonal fruits for most of his meal preps. Here the fruit is paired with beef skewers made with mushrooms, onions, and bell peppers served on a bed of kale.        9. The proteins in traditional Nioise salad are tuna, either fresh or canned, and a hard-boiled egg. @sg_food_n_fitness shakes things up by topping hers with baked salmon, and it looks delicious. Steamed green beans, tomatoes, and boiled potatoes add heartiness and texture, and hold up well after a few days of refrigeration. Olives and capers add saltiness that balances well with creamy boiled potatoes. Hardcore Nioise salad eaters can swap capers foranchovy filets, which are loaded with calcium and healthy fats. Try our Nioise Salad recipe.        10. Prepared chicken or turkey sausages make meal prep easy because they are already cooked and just need to be heated. These from @trigg-ah are sliced and quickly sauted with corn and red bell peppers. He packed them together with raw spinach, which doesnt need pre-cooking because it wilts when heated in the microwave  a great time-saving tip for meal preppers. Look for all natural, low sodium sausages."

Find Your Footing  Once the snow starts to fall, youll need to rethink your footwear. The reason: Underneath all of that powder are a host of hidden dangers  ice, roots, potholes, uneven terrain  and youll want shoes that can handle the extra punishment. I often switch to trail running shoes in winter, says Brendan Cournane, an elite Chicago-based running coach who has competed in marathons in all 50 states and all seven continents. Many of them have water-resistant uppers that help keep your feet dry, and their more aggressive lugs improve grip on slick terrain. Think of it like swapping your summer tires for winter ones  the deeper treads makes a huge difference when it comes to maintaining control.   Dont want to shell out for a new pair of shoes? There are plenty of grip enhancing devices that slip over the soles of existing shoes. Our pick: Yaktrax Run ($40, yaktrax.com). They easily attach to any type or size of running shoe, says Liz Corkum, a Road Runners Club of America-certified coach, nutritionist, and personal trainer based in New York City. Theyve gotten me through many 20-milers in tough conditions.      Adjust Your Form  Grippy shoes are a good start, but youll also need to modify your running technique if you want to stay on your feet. Each stride should be more of a shuffle with both feet closer to the ground, says Cournane, who also suggests slowing your pace and sticking to plowed streets and well-traveled sidewalks. Packed snow provides better traction.   When you make a turn, shorten your stride even more. It almost looks like Im jogging in place when I switch directions on slick sidewalks, says Heather Kampf, the 2014 USA 1-mile road champion. Being intentional about each step can help prevent nasty spills.      Increase Your Visibility  Shorter days often translate into darker runs, making it more important than ever to remain visible. Always wear bright colors and reflective gear, says Corkum. Look for clothing that has reflective material in key biomotion points, such as your wrists, ankles, and feet, so oncoming traffic can identify you as a human rather than a road sign, and give you extra room. If you run in locations that are completely dark after sundown, also consider wearing a headlamp, says Corkum. Not only will it add another layer of visibility, but it will also help you watch your step.      Stay Hydrated  Many runners forget how much they sweat in cold weather, says Cournane. But sweat isnt the only way you losing fluid  that mist your see every time you exhale in cold weather is water vapor condensing into tiny droplets and ice particles.   Try to drink half your weight in ounces of water throughout the day  if you weigh 150 pounds, your goal is 75 ounces, for example  and if your run lasts longer than an hour, carry a water bottle. Fill it with warm water before you head out so it wont freeze, suggests Cournane.      Layer Up  British author Alfred Wainwright once wrote that theres no such thing as bad weather, only unsuitable clothing. Never is that more true than during the winter, and oddly enough, one of the biggest mistakes people make is dressing too warmly. I tell my runners to dress as if the temperature is 15-20 degrees warmer than whats showing on the thermometer, says Cournane. It only takes about a half mile to a mile for most peoples bodies to warm up to a comfortable level.   That said, its always better to err on the side of caution, and layering (i.e., wearing multiple levels of clothing) will allow you to make adjustments on the fly. If you normally wear cotton when you exercise, stop  it holds moisture close to the skin, increasing heat loss. Instead, invest in some technical, moisture-wicking clothing, and then follow this cold-weather layering guide to maximize your comfort and performance during every run:   Above 60: Shorts and a short-sleeve shirt.   50 to 59: Same as above, but swap short sleeves for long sleeves.   40 to 49: Shorts or light tights and a half-zip, long sleeve shirt, which will allow you to vent if you become too warm. If its windy, also wear a light shell.   30 to 39: Technical underwear, tights, half-zip top, insulated vest, gloves, and a thin beanie. If its windy, also wear a light shell.   20 to 29: Technical underwear, tights, half-zip top, insulated jacket, gloves, and a thin beanie.   1 to 19: Windproof underwear, heavier tights, half-zip top, insulated jacket, insulated gloves, beanie, face mask.   Below 0: Thick socks, windproof underwear, heavier tights, half-zip top, insulated vest or jacket, wind-proof shell, insulated gloves, beanie, face mask."

Does Breastfeeding Really Help You Lose Weight + 11 Other Myths Revealed
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/get-started/wellness/does-breastfeeding-really-help-you-lose-weight-11-other-myths-revealed,"There are a lot of assumptions made about breastfeeding. Its the best way to deliver nutrients to your baby; its the most natural way to feed your little one; it wreaks havoc on your nipples, and changes the shape of your beautiful breasts forever. Perhaps one of the biggest ones, at least for moms who cant wait to drop the baby weight and get back in shape: It burns massive calories, and is natures way of helping new moms lose weight.   Because this last notion can be so crucial to moms who might long to regain some control over their postpartum bodies rather quickly, lets dispel the myth that breastfeeding will automatically help you lose weight. Yes, it burns calories, and may help lower body mass index (see myth #1 below for more details), but you cant skip the basic weight-loss principles (and overall good health) of keeping an eye on total daily calories, moving more, and choosing quality whole foods to fulfill your nutrition needs and those of your baby.   The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that  babies be exclusively breastfed for the first six months of life , and then at least partially for the next six months (since you can introduce solid foods at this point). Outside of that, though, the decision of whether or not to breastfeed, how often to do it, and when to stop are highly individualized.   Ultimately, each individual mother is uniquely qualified to decide whether breastfeeding, mixed feeding, or formula feeding is best for her individual situation, says Alison Stuebe, M.D., distinguished scholar of infant and young child feeding at the  Carolina Global Breastfeeding Institute , and associate professor of maternal fetal medicine at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.   Were not here to tell you what choices you should and shouldnt be making. But we are here to make sure youre accurately informed. From whether or not to use formula to sore nipples to abstaining from caffeine and alcohol, there are a ton of rumors around breastfeeding. Which are true and which are myths? We had experts weigh in on 12 of the most popular ones so you can better decide whats best for you.   12 Myths About Breastfeeding: Whats the Truth?   Myth: Breastfeeding helps you lose the pregnancy weight.   Truth:  Unarguably, breastfeeding causes you to burn calories  the  American Pregnancy Association recommends consuming an extra 300500 calories  a day. A Dutch study published in the  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition  found that breastfeeding could help women  with the exception of those who weighed the most before pregnancy   eliminate weight gained during pregnancy  (about 26 pounds) after six months.   Whats more, a study in the  International Journal of Obesity  looked at nearly 750,000 women ages 50 to 64 and found that those who had breastfed their babies not only had a lower body mass index (BMI) than those who did not breastfeed, but they also  decreased their BMIs by one percent for every six months they breastfed .   But, just because breastfeeding helps you burn more calories doesnt necessarily mean you will lose weight, points out Laura Gruber, international board certified lactation consultant, registered lactation consultant, and owner of  Breastfeeding Housecalls  in San Antonio.   Breastfeeding mothers tend to feel hungrier, which means they may snack more to make up for those extra calories burned. The choice to consume healthy or unhealthy snacks, and the quantity a mother consumes is what may ultimately drive some moms  not  to lose the pregnancy weight via breastfeeding alone, Gruber says.   Youre still eating for two when you breastfeed, meaning that you pass along whatever nutrition you take in to your baby. This does not  mean  that you should eat as much of whatever foods youd like, especially if those foods arent nutrient-dense. Eat enough calories to fuel your body properly for nursing, and whatever exercise program you may be doing. If youre following a  Beachbody program , you might want to bump up to the next (higher) calorie bracket (considering that breastfeeding burns an extra 300500 calories per day).   Myth: You cant breastfeed if you have implants.   Truth:  Its safe for mothers and for babies to breastfeed if mom has implants, Alison Stuebe reassures. But if you have had plastic surgery, its important to let your doc know. Why? Your natural breasts may affect how well you produce milk.   If one breast was much smaller than the other, or if you had minimal breast tissue, you might make less milk, so its important to work closely with your babys provider to monitor early weight gain so that you and your baby get off to a good start, Stuebe adds.   If you have breast implants and plan to breastfeed, you may need to supplement to ensure your baby gets enough to eat. A review and meta-analysis of three observational studies published in the  International Breastfeeding Journal  revealed that  women with breast implants who breastfed  were less likely to feed their infants with breast milk exclusively compared to women without breast implants. Another study published in the  Annals of Plastic Surgery  also reported that many  women with breast implants needed to supplement their breastfeeding .   Myth: You must use both breasts each time you feed.   Truth:  Its a good idea to offer both, Gruber says. Sometimes babies lose vigor and stamina at the breast because they are tired, yet not necessarily full. They can become tired from sucking on a breast that isnt yielding as much as they need, she explains.   Her recommendation: Use your first breast until a baby loses vigor or stamina, since this is the most accurate way of knowing if a healthy baby is getting full. Stop and burp him or her, then always offer the second breast in case baby has made room for more [after] burping. If your baby doesnt want the second breast, thats fine. Then, you can start with the second breast at the next feed, since it will likely be fuller, she adds.   Myth: Modern formulas are almost the same as breastmilk.   Truth:  Formula makers may market their product as being almost as good as the real thing. Breastmilk is a living fluid. Formula is not, Stuebe says. To illustrate, scientists have found that  human milk contains immune and stem cells , as well as bacterial community.   A mothers milk contains bacteria that colonize her babys gut, helping to grow the babys immune system. And while some formulas have added prebiotics and probiotics, they are fundamentally different from breast milk, Stuebe explains.   Myth: Poor milk supply is caused by moms inadequate diet or stress.     Truth:  There are millions of women everywhere who have stressful lives and poor nutrition yet are still able to produce perfect amounts of milk for their babies, Gruber points out. Low milk supply is generally caused by poor breastfeeding management (such as not feeding baby frequently, or a shallow latch), hormonal issues in mom, or oral issues in baby that would cause poor milk transfer, she explains.   Myth: You cant drink alcohol while breastfeeding.   Truth:  Great news mamas  this ones a myth. It takes about two hours for a single serving of alcohol (5 oz. of wine, 12 oz. of beer, or 1.5 oz. of liquor) to clear a womans bloodstream. When it clears her bloodstream, it also clears her milk, Stuebe explains.   More alcohol does takes more time to clear out, so you may need to pump and discard milk if youve had two or three servings. Check  this handy chart  that Stuebe recommends.   Myth: Breastfeeding is supposed to hurt.   Truth:  Breastfeeding may feel new and different, but it is not supposed to hurt, Gruber says. With the exception of childbirth, pain is the bodys alert system when something is wrong, so nipples that hurt mean that something is off and can be improved. Moms who feel nipple pain, see or feel their nipples injured, or see misshapen nipples when her baby unlatches should seek help, she adds.   Myth: Breastfeeding drastically changes the shape and size of your breasts.   Truth:  For starters, its important to understand that pregnancy is what changes your body, not breastfeeding. Secondly, your breasts will change, but only temporarily. Breastfeeding can drastically change the shape and size of a womans breasts  but only during certain seasons of nursing, such as when moms milk is transitioning from colostrum to mature milk, Gruber says. Breasts normally return back to pre-pregnancy size and shape after a woman has ended her breastfeeding season.   A study published in the  Aesthetic Surgery Journal  reviewed the charts of 93 patients seeking consultation for aesthetic breast surgery, and found that  breastfeeding does not appear to have an adverse effect upon breast appearance .   Myth: Breastfeeding is just about getting the milk to your baby.   Truth:  Nurturing your baby is about so much more than nursing. Breastfeeding is about fostering a biological connection between a mother her child, and a mother can nurture her baby at breast no matter how much milk she makes, Stuebe says. Suckling a baby triggers release of the hormone oxytocin, which can encourage bonding and mothering behavior. A baby who is at breast can hear moms heartbeat, and can focus his eyes on moms face.   Even moms who dont provide 100 percent of their babys nutrition from their breasts are still able to offer them for suckling, warmth, and comfort. Being an infants food source is just one of the many hats that breasts wear when it comes to babies, Gruber adds.   Myth: Smaller breasts may not produce enough milk to feed the baby.   Truth:  Bra size isnt a reliable predictor of milk production, but some breasts do produce better than others, Stuebe says.   OK, quick biology lesson from Stuebe: An adult womans breasts are made up of both fatty tissue and milk-making glandular tissue. One woman might have small breasts that are packed with glandular tissue (great for milk production), while another has very large breasts that are mostly fatty tissue (not so great). And the shape matters, too  widely spaced or cone-shaped breasts can be associated with low milk production, Stuebe adds.   Its not easy to predict milk-making based on breast size, which is why its important that all moms and babies see a pediatric provider at three to five days after birth to check in on how breastfeeding is going, Stuebe says.   Myth: You cant get pregnant while breastfeeding.     Truth:  We dont know who started this rumor, but breastfeeding is definitely not birth control. You can absolutely get pregnant while nursing, Gruber reassures.   Frequent nursing does prevent ovulation. But, if you pump and use bottles, or your baby doesnt want to eat often, youre going a longer time between feedings at the breast than a mom who breastfeeds every couple of hours. This break can cause a mom to ovulate earlier thus sparking moms fertility even if that mom hasnt had her first period yet after childbirth, Gruber explains.   If you want to avoid pregnancy, talk to your doc about birth control options. And dont worry; Gruber assures contraception wont reduce your milk supply.   But, can contraception impact the quality of your milk? Research draws mixed conclusions; one review revealed a  negative effect on breast milk composition  in moms taking birth control, while another trial showed greater weight gain in infants whose moms had an  etonogestrel implant . An article published in  Clinical and Obstetrics and Gynecology  found that the  choice and timing of contraception   with nonhormonal methods being the preferred choice  may influence breastfeeding and infant growth patterns. The bottom line: Talk openly with your doctor to explore all of the options to find out what works best for you and your baby.   Myth: The longer you breastfeed, the healthier your baby will be in adolescence.   Truth:  This ones a bit more complicated. Theres compelling evidence that, on a population level, longer breastfeeding is linked with better health, Stuebe says.   A study analysis published in  Maternal & Child Nutrition , of which Stuebe was a part of, found that for every 597 women who optimally breastfeed,  one maternal or child death is prevented .   However, thats on a population level. For an individual mother and her child, there are many, many things that contribute to her childs health in adolescence, of which breastfeeding is just one, Stuebe adds. If breastfeeding is extraordinarily difficult for that mom and baby, the struggle to make it work may not be worth it.   The Takeaway   Whilenursing isnt the golden ticket to a pre-baby body, it does burn calories and, paired with a healthy lifestyle and thoughtful nutrition plan, can help you slim down to your pre-pregnancy weight more quickly if youre careful. Just dont be overly restrictive when it comes to calories and the quality of your calories."

Full-Time Nurse and Mother of Two Loses 28 Pounds, Wins $500
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/full-time-nurse-and-mother-of-two-loses-28-pounds-wins-500,"Christine Adams lost 28 lbs. with  21 Day Fix,   FOCUS T25 ,  INSANITY MAX:30 , and  21 Day Fix EXTREME  fitness programs and the  Beachbody Performance  supplements. She entered her results into the  Beachbody Challenge , and won the $500 Daily Prize for December 3rd!   Christine is an Independent Beachbody Coach.    Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?   After my sons were born, I initially didnt care about my weight, because I knew that taking care of them was my priority. I also convinced myself that after I was finished pumping/breastfeeding, the weight would just fall off. Thats what everyone says(that breastfeeding helps you lose weight). I was still 10 lbs. away from my pre-pregnancy weight when I finished breastfeeding. Before I could find the motivation to start an exercise program, I gained 8 lbs. back. I was stressed out with having a four-year-old and one-year-old at home, and working full-time. I was sleep-deprived and irritable all the time. Overall, I was disgusted with the way that I looked. I had little energy, little confidence, and found myself avoiding going out, because I didnt like how clothes fit on me. I used I work full-time and have two young kids as an excuse for not being able to find the time to exercise. I took my frustrations out on my kids and husband, and all of my relationships suffered.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  My husband followed a few accounts on Instagram, such as Born 2 Transform, and he shared inspiring stories and pictures of fit momswith me. For nearly a year, we kept following them and I told myself, When my son turns one, I will stop pumping and then I can make exercise a priority. I feared that my milk supply would decrease drastically if I started exercising too soon. It was also very difficult to schedule a workout time, because I spent 20-30 minutes pumping four to sixtimes a day, and I was always exhausted. After my son turned one, I still couldnt find the energy or motivation to exercise, and kept making excuses. So we tried Shakeology, which I loved. My husband signed up as a Coach for the 25 percent discount and the following month, he signed me up as a Coach under him.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  I was always my biggest challenge, standing in my own way. As an RN, I knew everything I needed to do to be healthy, but I wasnt practicing what I was teaching my patients. I made every excuse I could to rationalize my behavior and lifestyle. I wasnt happy with myself, and my negative attitude affected my relationships with my children, husband, and co-workers. When I accepted the Beachbody Challenge, I was able to change my mindset. Each day, I was surrounded by positive, like-minded people with similar goals who gave me daily motivation, inspiration, and accountability. I havent been happier or had this much energy since my senior year of high school (I lost 30 lbs. the summer before senior year). The personal development and positive mindset has made me a better mother, co-worker, and wife. I feel like I can achieve anything I set my mind to. My upline Coaches and team have helped me become a better version of me  not just physically, but mentally and spiritually as well.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?   21 Day Fix : I loved the portion-control containers and nutrition guide. It really put into perspective the amount of food my body needed versusthe amount of food I was consuming. I loved the variety of different exercises and that they were only 30 minutes!  FOCUS T25 : I loved that I didnt need any equipment, just my body. Each workout was challenging and only 25 minutes! I also love Shaun Ts phrases and style of motivation.  INSANITY MAX:30 : I loved the challenge and competition I had with myself to try and beat my time from the previous week. Every single workout was challenging, and Shaun T always knows what to say to push you to reach your max. This was the hardest program I have ever done but also my favorite, because overcoming the greatest struggle is what makes everything worth it and makes it the greatest accomplishment.  21 Day Fix EXTREME : Again, I loved the focus on nutrition, clean eating, and portion control. I love  the Fixate cookbook. The 21 Day Fix Eating Planhas helped me to make a complete lifestyle change!   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  In just five short months, I went from a size eight jeans to a size  zero.  I  had to go and find my bin of clothes from high school (2004). I can complete an entire INSANITY MAX:30 cardio challenge without having to stop or modify.Before starting 21 Day Fix, I would get short of breath after fiveminutes of cardio, and at times would start wheezing and need to use an inhaler. I can do push-ups  unmodified  and in sets of 20! I can do  chin-ups  for the first time ever in my life! I have  abs  visible abs without even flexing! I went from 29 percent to 20percentbody fat! I never thought that any of this was achievable for me.But I am in better shape now after having two kids in three years than I have ever been before in my life.        How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I havent been happier, more confident, purpose-driven, or energized since my senior year of high school (2004). I start each day with scripture readings, 30 minutes of exercise, and at least 10 minutes of audio personal development while driving to work. My marriage and relationships with my kids and co-workers are flourishing, and my mindset has completely changed. From May 2014 to February 2015, I had been applying and interviewing for a new job, and kept getting let down. I eventually told myself that if I saw another posting, I wouldnt even apply anymorebut after completing my first challenge in April 2015, my mindset and confidence skyrocketed! I applied for the sixth time, interviewed for the fourthtime on the same day my husband reached the milestone of Diamond Coach, and found out one week later that I finally got the job. Attitude and mindset are everything !   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  I started my first program (21Day Fix) in a Challenge Group with my Coach (my husband), my mother-in-law, and my sister-in-law. Every time someone posted a motivational quote or picture of a post-workout selfie, it motivated me to do the same and go work out if I hadnt already done so that day. With so much positive energy going around, it was impossible not to reach my goals. It was also helpful to see them post about their struggles and setbacks, because it let me know that Im not alone. As more and more people (mostly close friends, family, and co-workers) joined each Challenge Group, the motivation grew exponentially, and I was able to reach my weight-loss goals even sooner than expected. It was even more amazing knowing that I had the support of close friends, co-workers, and family, because these were the people I spent most of my time with. In order to be successful in maintaining a healthy lifestyle, I needed to be constantly surrounded by like-minded people with similar goals.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  My Coach is my husband, and he has always pushed me to be better. Seeing how his mindset changed from the interactions he was having with his upline Coach and team was very inspiring. All the personal development he was doing made him a better father and husband. In the beginning, I was very resistant to him being a Team Beachbody Coach, but witnessing how he helps change lives, mine included, has made me fall in love with him all over again. We keep each other accountable and support each other. Even though I have reached my weight-loss goals and he hasnt yet, he still tells me every day about how proud he is of me and how I inspire him.   How  did  a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your  transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/ regularity ?   Shakeology : I regret not trying Shakeology three years ago when I first did two rounds of  INSANITY . I have so much more energy since drinking Shakeology daily. I also used to eat 10 or more fun-sized pieces of chocolate threeto fourdays a week while at work.But since starting Shakeology, I no longer have sweet tooth cravings and have not eaten chocolate bars since Easter.  E&E / R&R : I would not have been able to wake up at 4:45 a.m. and push through the last month of FOCUS T25 and the first month of INSANITY MAX:30 without this pre- and post-workout formula. I regret not using this when I first did INSANITY in 2012, because the results came so much faster compared to when I wasnt using it.  Energize  &  Recover : I started using these in month two of INSANITY MAX:30. I definitely needed Energize to complete such an intense workout at 5 a.m., and Recover helped to reduce muscle soreness. P90X Protein Bars: These were essential for my mid-morning or mid-afternoon snack. They kept me full and tasted like a cheat meal.   How  did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program affect any existing health conditions you  have ?  The only health condition I have ever had is childhood asthma. I hadnt experienced any episodes of wheezing for over 10 years, but it resurfaced within the first few months after my sons were born, when I first attempted to exercise. Since my first round of 21Day Fix, I have not had any more problems with wheezing.   You can change your life, too.

Transformation Tuesday: Faith Lost 33 Pounds with Beachbody!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-faith-lost-33-pounds-with-beachbody,"After giving birth to her second child, Faith B. was looking for a way to lose her post-baby weight. She had a tough time with her weight after her first child, and she didnt want to have the same difficulties this time. Tired of feeling self-conscious of her body, she saw a sign to try Beachbody programs. She tried FOCUS T25 and PiYo and lost 33 pounds and 19.5 inches in just 7 months! Read her story in her own words below:   In November 2014, I had my second child. I gained 50 pounds with my second pregnancy and the weight seemed to be falling off at first, but I started to notice it coming back. I became very depressed and didnt want to look in the mirror. I was so angry at myself for gaining that much weight. The worst part of my day was putting on my clothes and nothing fitting. I wouldnt even let my husband see me change because I was so ashamed.   When I was breastfeeding my son at all hours of the night, I noticed the FOCUS T25 commercial. It must have been a sign because for over a week straight, my son woke up when it came on, and I kept watching it. I finally brought it up to my husband that I needed to do something, and I believed this was it!   When it came, I started. I couldnt believe how fast and hard it was at first. I didnt know how to lunge or do squats, so I had to modify.  Slowly but surely, I got better and started to see the weight drop. I felt better and I was smiling.   After FOCUS T25, I got PiYo with Vegan Shakeology ! I was never the yoga type, but Chalene kicks your butt! I felt my muscles getting stronger and it was challenging! I started to see results in about 3 or 4 days with the amount of sweat that was happening. Not only thatbut PiYos workouts really did just helpme to be aware of my body more and with my posture , which is something Ive always struggled with.     You can change your life, too.

How to Overcome 12 Common Weight-Loss Obstacles
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/weight-loss/how-to-overcome-12-common-weight-loss-obstacles,"Whether youd like to drop five pounds or 50, it can feel like there are a million weight-loss obstacles standing in your way.   Losing weight isnt always easy, and there might be many mental, logistical, and lifestyle factors to overcome to reach your goal. But dont despair: You  can  shed those stubborn pounds with a little soul-searching ( do I really hate cauliflower? ) and some practical tips  (wait, I can roast cauliflower?? This is SO GOOD!).   To maximize your chances of success, start by taking a few minutes to identify your biggest obstacles to losing weightand see how you can overcome them. Here are 12 of the most common ones that get in the way of losing weight.   (And check out these dramatic  Before and After  stories if you need proof and inspiration!)   Diet Obstacles   Obstacle: You dont have time to cook.   Solution: Do some prep work.   No one is denying that its easier to order takeout than it is to make something from scratch. But cooking healthy meals doesnt have to be a major time-suck. Some tasty options  like a  main course salad   dont even require any cooking at all. The key is to think about what youll eat long before your tummy starts rumbling.   Tammy Lakatos Shames, RDN, CFT, a dietitian, personal trainer, and co-author of  The Nutrition Twins Veggie Cure ,  suggests taking some time over the weekend to  plan out your meals  for the following week, stock up on ingredients, and chop up some veggies and protein so youll be in good shape when you peek into the fridge after a long day at work.   Obstacle: You hate being hungry.   Solution: Load up on low-calorie, filling foods.   Surprise: You dont have to eat tiny amounts food to lose weight. In fact, youre  better off not depriving yourself  or you might end up backsliding pretty quickly.   The best way to feel full  and lose weight  is to fill up on a combo of whole grains, fruits and vegetables, and lean protein, says Lakatos Shames. [Processed or simple] carbs by themselves will give you energy, but youll come crashing down soon after because you dont have any protein and fiber to slow down digestion.   Shes also a fan of keeping lots of non-starchy veggies on hand, like broccoli,  Brussels sprouts ,  cauliflower , and squash. Drizzle on flavorful vinegars and spices to make them more interesting. Or  roast them so they caramelize  and taste sweet, she suggests. Not only are they filled with loads of nutrition (vitamins, minerals, and phytonutrients), the fiber and water will help fill you up.   Obstacle: You dont like the taste of healthy food.   Solution: Be patient and keep trying new things.   First of all, you may not really know what good, nutritious food tastes like. (Hint: Its not plain, flavorless chicken and limp, over-cooked veggies.) Watch a  healthy cooking show  to learn the basics and experiment with some new recipes. Need some ideas? You can find a slew of options  right here .   But if you just dont think anything will taste good unless its deep-fried and loaded with salt or sugar, be patient. As you build out your recipe repertoire and try new things, youll find foods that you enjoy, and even ones that dont seem appealing right now might eventually become your favorites.   Pro tip:  Use  healthy spices to boost the taste and flavors  in your dishes to point your tastebuds in the right direction.   Obstacle: You think nutritious food is too expensive.   Solution: Make smart choices.   Spendy organic produce is great, but its not essential for good health or weight loss, says Lakatos Shames. Try to shop for whats in-season  its almost always cheaper  and remember that  frozen vegetables and fruit  are usually as nutritious as their fresh counterparts.   Lakatos Shames also advises clients  on a budget  to eat more  vegetarian- and plant-based protein  while limiting expensive items, like meat.   And if you think that fast-food combo meal is cheaper than a healthy salad, think again. Research suggests that staying fit and healthy could  save you cold, hard cash  in health-related expenses down the road.   And even in the short-term, losing weight can be cost-effective if you want it to be, says Holly Lucille, ND, RN, a Los Angeles-based naturopathic physician and CrossFit coach. Not going out to dinner as often and drinking less wine are pretty good ways to save some money, she says.   Fitness Obstacles   Obstacle: You think exercise is boring.   Solution: Find something you love.   If you consider your workout a chore, then youre doing the wrong workout. Finding a fun activity is really crucial if you want to stick with it long enough to lose the weight and keep it off.   If running a treadmill is about as exciting to you as staring as a brick wall, dont do it. Experiment with other types of workouts until you find a good fit: Try a  country line dancing class , kick some butt in a  mixed-martial arts workout , or check out a  yoga class ; your  options are endless !   Obstacle: You dont have time to exercise.   Solution: Find a workout that fits your schedule.   Lack of time is one of the biggest barriers, but its also about making workouts a priority, says Lakatos Shames. Scheduling a time in your day like you would an appointment can help you do that.   But if youre really time-strapped, make sure youre getting the most out of your sweat sessions. Choose a workout thats designed to yield major results quickly. Beachbodys  Focus T25  and  22-Minute Hard Corps , for example, were created to get you an hours worth of results in less than half an hour.   Both programs also employ h igh-intensity interval training (HIIT) , which helps you burn more calories every minute compared to steady-state exercise. You also  keep  burning more calories for days afterward: By varying your intensity level  you get your heart rate up and down and up and down again you increase post-exercise oxygen consumption, so you end up burning calories long after youve finished your workout, says Lucille.   Obstacle: You push yourself too hard, too often.   Solution: Make recovery a priority.   Walking your dog around the block may get your heart pumping a little, but its rarely enough to help you lose weight. Likewise, its easy to go overboard, and some people end up  hitting fitness plateaus  because they dont ever give their bodies the time they need to recover from all of the intense exercise theyre doing.   Allowing adequate time for recovery is extremely important, says Lucille. When Im forced to rest a little and then go back to the gym, my speed and efficiency ends up being better.   But before you get too excited, recovery doesnt equal lying on the couch all day with the remote. There  is  a difference between  rest and recovery days ; on rest days, youll want to focus on getting sleep and replenishing your energy stores. On recovery days, you can still work out, but to a lesser degree. Try a gentle yoga routine from  Beachbodys 3 Week Yoga Retreat , or these  full-body stretches .   Its important for your body to be challenged by doing something its not already used to, says Lucille.   Obstacle: You rely on workouts to do it all.   Solution: Understand that exercise is just part of the puzzle.   While exercise can definitely help you lose weight, you cant expect results if you focus on fitness while ignoring bad eating habits. Research shows that people who start a  healthy diet AND a workout program  at the same time are more likely to be doing both a year later.   In my experience, Id say weight loss is about 60 percent diet and 40 percent exercise, says Lucille.   Obstacle: Your joints ache.   Solution: Go low-impact.   Whether youre recovering from an injury or have a  chronic issue , its hard to move when youre in pain. Assuming you have your doctors OK, try stepping up your activity just a little bit, and focus on  low-impact exercise , says Lakatos Shames.    Any movement at all is better than sitting  on the couch, and even spending 30 minutes on an exercise bike or swimming may help you lose weight if you were pretty sedentary before, she explains.   Emotional Obstacles   Obstacle: Youre just not that motivated.   Solution: Set short-  and  long-term goals.   Theres a reason why its often easier to lose weight before a wedding or school reunion. But those types of motivators tend to be fleeting, and before you know it those 10 pounds (or more) are back on.   Setting a  long-term, non-scale goal   say, to avoid health issues that a parent or grandparent has  will help, but youll probably need some extra targets to shoot for along the way.   I once lost weight mainly by challenging myself to do a certain number of push-ups every day until I could do 100, says Lucille. Some people find that getting competitive  perhaps by signing up for a series of challenging events,  like a marathon , or 5K  keeps them invested in staying fit.   Obstacle: Youre embarrassed by your failed attempts.   Solution: Let it go, rethink, and reboot.   Lots of people try to lose weight and repeatedly fail, and they  end up beating themselves up  for it.   If that sounds like you, Lucille suggests nixing shame and blame by doing a 21-day autopsy  spend five minutes each night reviewing your habits and thinking about what went right (and what didnt) that day, and try not to make any harsh judgments.   The goal is to eventually have an a-ha moment that enables you to stop feeling guilty and instead  focus on moving forward .   Obstacle: Your willpower disappears in the face of temptation.   Solution: Plan your defense.   Sometimes it might seem like the entire world is out to sabotage your weight-loss efforts. Try to think ahead and predict where diet traps may arise so you can be ready with a healthy snack or distraction.   Pro tip:  Dont go hungry where temptation lurks (were looking at you, happy hour and office birthdays). Have a small nibble or a  healthy shake  beforehand and youll be more apt to resist unhealthy treats.   Obstacles are made to be overcome, so add these solutions to your weight-loss toolbox and watch those pounds drop off, slow and steady."

The Crazy-Busy Person’s Guide to Weight Loss
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/weight-loss/the-crazy-busy-persons-guide-to-weight-loss,"Losing weight is challenging no matter what, but when you have a hectic schedule full of appointments, errands, and random time-sucking obligations, your New Years  weight-lossresolution  to slim down can feel straight-up impossible.   Heres the good news, though: You dont need to quit your job and go to boot camp to successfully lose weight. You can shed pounds  slowly but surely  while continuing to hustle and keep up with your commitments.   The key is learning to plan ahead and organize your day in a smart, efficient way. Before long, your  weight-loss habits  will become second-nature, not to mention totally worth the extra effort.   Read on for 11 easy tips for losing weight on a busy schedule!     1. Meal Prep Every Week   Meal prep  doesnt just save time and energy, its also key to ensuring you stay on track with your nutrition goals.   Every Sunday, block off a couple hours to make a weekly meal plan, go  grocery shopping , and hunker down in the kitchen to chop, dice, grill, and plan your meals for the week.   If you dont want to cook entire meals in advance, you can still cut down the steps by setting aside ingredients and chopping vegetables and fruit ahead of time. Pre-sliced veggies are ideal because you can snack on them raw  and   incorporate them in meals , says Amy Gorin, MS, RDN, and owner of  Amy Gorin Nutrition  in Jersey City, NJ.   You can also make things like  soup ,  ground turkey stir-frys , and  casseroles  ahead of time to store in your freezer. I like to make  crustless muffin-size quiches  and freeze the extra portions so I [always] have healthy meals on hand, says Gorin.   Proper portion sizes are a key part of meal prepping for weight loss: Using  portion-control containers  is an easy way to make sure your meals are balanced, especially if youre trying to  lose weight for the first time .   Not sure where to start? Check out these  healthy meal-prep ideas from the pros .     2. Store Healthy Snacks in Your Desk and Bag   The key to resisting that mid-morning muffin craving at work is to have satisfying,  nutrient-rich snacks  at the ready.   Store snacks in your bag and at your desk, says Gorin. This way, youre not relying on whatevers available at the corner market or vending machine. For  protein-rich snacks , try hard-boiled eggs, beef jerky, or edamame. For  snacks under 200 calories , bring in some pistachios, roasted chickpeas, or seaweed.     3. Drink More Water   Research suggests that drinking water before a meal  can help you feel more full . An easy way to check that off your list is to carry a reusable water bottle with you at all times. Refill it regularly and aim to  drink half your body weight (in pounds) in ounces each day .   If youre notoriously bad at hydrating, here are  25 easy ways to drink more water .     4. Keep Fruit in Plain Sight   When youre at home,  keep fruit on the countertop , says Gorin. Research shows you may be more likely to reach for it if its visible. A Cornell University study found that women who had a fruit bowl out  weighed 13 pounds less  than women who had cereal or sodas sitting on their kitchen counter.   Same goes at work: Skip the candy bowl and get a basket and load it with your favorite fruits. Try  apples for a hit of fiber , or bananas to sneak in some  potassium , and  pears for a sweet, low-calorie snack . And dont forget about  seasonal options  like grapefruit, oranges, and kiwis.   5. Make Your Workouts Consistent   Although diet plays a major role in losing weight,  pairing it with regular exercise  is critical if you want to achieve weight-loss success.   But how do you squeeze in a sweat session when your day is jam-packed? I recommend  working out in the morning  before people start making demands of you and life has a chance to get in the way, says Trevor Thieme, C.S.C.S., Beachbodys fitness and nutrition content manager.   If mornings are out of the question  maybe you have a long commute or an early drop-off time for your kids  identify another time of day thats consistently free of commitments. For some people, that might be during lunch. For others, it might be after work. Whenever it is, reserve it for exercise.   Working out at home is a good way to make sure you get your workout in  and its harder to make excuses! With a streaming service like  Beachbody On Demand , youll have hundreds of workouts with nutrition guides, calendars, and progress trackers at your fingertips.   6. Eat at a Table (*no phones allowed)   Instead of snacking as you scroll through emails or eating dinner while bingeing on Netflix, walk away from the screens and sit down at a table. (Novel concept, right?!)   Youre probably thinking,  How exactly will sitting help me lose weight?!  Well, pay attention to this fun fact: Research shows youre more likely to consume greater amounts of food  if you eat while youre distracted .   While it might seem counterintuitive to carve out 30 minutes just to eat when you could multitask, a 2001 study suggests that multitasking may actually  decrease your productivity  by as much as 40 percent.   In addition, paying attention to your food  chewing slowly and savoring flavors  doesnt just help you appreciate your meal, it also makes it easier to recognize the signals your body sends you about whether youre full or not.   This practice of  mindful eating can help you lose weight , but even better than that, it can also  help you  keep  the pounds off  once youve slimmed down.   7. Swap Cardio for Strength Training   Strength training trumps traditional cardio (think: long slow distance) when it comes to losing the right kind of weight: fat.   But the most effective method is to combine cardio and strength training by doing  high-intensity circuits  sets of several exercises performed back-to-back with little or no rest in between, says Thieme. Not only will you burn tons of calories during your workout, but youll also raise your metabolism for more than 48 hours afterward.   Heres another advantage of such such workouts: They double down on the benefits of both aerobic and strength training in half the time of a typical cardio or weightlifting session. If youve ever tried a program like  P90X3 ,  22 Minute Hard Corps , or  INSANITY MAX:30 , you know that a half hour is all it takes to get in a killer total-body workout, Thieme says.   8. Share Your Food   Whether youre at an office birthday party, on a date, or out to dinner with friends, youll inevitably encounter temptations in the form of chocolate and/or salty, carb-heavy sides.   If you want to (and can!) avoid these foods altogether, great. If, on the other hand, you want to enjoy a bite or two every once in a while, go for it. The key to  sticking with your nutrition goals  is not to deprive yourself, but to be sensible about how much you indulge.   Split your desserts or sides with someone else to cut down on the calories. You know what [the dessert] tastes like, and the first bite or two is always the best, anyway, Gorin says.   9. Have Emergency Food on Hand   On particularly chaotic weeks, sometimes meal prepping just doesnt happen. And even if you have plenty of healthy ingredients on hand, sometimes you dont have the patience or energy to cook.   Thats why Gorin recommends stocking your pantry and desk drawers with quick and easy emergency food, like cans of low-sodium soup, canned tuna packed in water, canned low-sodium beans, and whole-grain crackers. There  are  healthy packaged food options out there; just make sure to check the ingredient list.   10. Move More   The most successful weight loss plans entail not just eating more healthfully and exercising more intensely, but also  moving more throughout the day , says Thieme. Your goal: To keep your metabolism humming in a higher gear during more of the 23- and a half hours you arent working up a sweat.   For most people, thats going to require thinking outside the box/gym. If you sit in an office all day, take a three to 10-minute break every hour to walk around the building or perform squats and arm rolls at your desk. Instead of sending emails to people down the hall (or even on different floors), pay them a visit. If you have a phone call with a client or an in-person meeting with co-workers, skip the conference room and talk as you walk.   And dont limit this sort of creative thinking to your workplace. Do calf raises while brushing your teeth, stretch and foam roll while you watch TV, take your dog for a walk as you chat on the phone  do anything you can to spend more time on your feet and less time on your rump.   11. Rethink Your Beverages   A full day of commitments and responsibilities usually requires a boost (or two or three) of caffeine to make it through. But the rich, sugary coffee beverages most people rely on (think pumpkin spice lattes) have no nutritional value.   Instead of sipping half your daily calories through a green plastic straw, Gorin suggests taking a walk to get a  refill of water  or  hot tea . That might reset your mood and your commitment to healthy eating. If you do have a cup of coffee, says Gorin, swap the creamer for milk and sweeten it with a sprinkle of cinnamon instead of sugar.   Achieving your goal of losing weight doesnt mean you have to make a bunch of huge, life-altering changes all at once. Sometimes all it takes is making smaller, smarter choices throughout your day to get you moving in the right direction."

Denise and David Beast Up Together
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/before-and-after-results/denise-and-david-beast-up-together,"If roses and candy dont cut it when you think about showing your partner how much you care, what about starting to work out together? Think about it youll get to spend some quality time together every day, helping and supporting each other to reach goals, while you get healthy and improve your lives together. Not to mention the physical improvements youre both sure to see in each other! Thats what Denise and David did together, they took on  Body Beast  and saw improvements in themselves and their family really quickly. After they completed the program, they competed in the Beachbody Classic together. Read on for their story, in their own words:   Denise:  I felt insecure because my skin was sagging and flabby. I wore Spanxevery day, even if it was just to go to the supermarket. It affected my marriage and my friendships because I wasnt myself anymore. I still had a mom body skinny legs and arms with a kangaroo belly pouch. I knew I had to step up my game by strength training with Body Beast if I truly wanted to change my physique. It was my idea to start. I purchased the program in 2014 and did one complete round by myself before I forced him to join me. He was suffering from back problems after years of running, and I got tired of watching him feel sorry for himself. I told him, You need this in your life, and thankfully, he trusted me enough to give it a shot.   David: We set a goal and wrote it down; it was to win the Beachbody Classic. Then we did Body Beast together on the same schedule so we always knew where we were on a daily basis. This helped us to stay focused and motivated. We woke up with a plan, did the workouts, and it was good because we did not let each other slack off.   Denise: Dave and I knew that if we were going to do this, we had to do it right, starting with w aking up at 4:30 AM each morning to work out together so the kids had us both available when they got home from school. Following the Body Beast calendar, nutrition guide, and Sagis competition prep was vital. No matter what got in the way  birthday parties, family BBQs, holidays  it didnt matter, he was there right by my side going through it right along with me and I love my husband more today than ever before.   David: I couldnt believe how much my body changed in such a short amount of time. It was the first time I ate for the gains and I followed the meal plan as closely as possible. I started to feel strong and I was filling out my clothes better. I was so proud of Denise because she impressed me with how she was able to go heavier with her lifts and do more push-ups.     David: To go through this process of working out, eating right, and preparing for the competition alone would be very difficult. Doing it all together helped because we went through the same struggles together. We knew how the other was feeling when we had to cut carbs and do extra cardio and drink gallons of water and apply the self-tanning oils and practice posing routines. It was also important that we were  real with each other. Its helpful when your spouse tells you what you  need to hear as opposed to what you  want to hear. Denise helped me make the corrections I needed in my diet and posingto become better.    Denise: Knowing that hes right there to give me those words of encouragement when I feel like giving up is the reason Ive been able to get this far in my fitness level.   David: The best part of the Classic last year was being able to walk on stage together holding hands. Walking through the tunnel up to the stage I thought about all those workouts, all that sweat and struggle. I thought about all those meals we prepped together and endless hours of practicing; then to walk out on stage together and show the crowd how we accomplished getting into the best shape of our lives was a truly amazing moment for me.   David: I feel it helped us to communicate better and become a stronger team. Since we were on the same path, we made a pact to get the kids ready in the morning together. While one parent made the breakfast and got the snacks together, the other was brushing hair and getting them dressed. This helped us to be more efficient with our time and allowed us to get more done. We also ate a lot of the same meals, of course in different portions, but it helped us take the guesswork out of what to eat every day.   Denise: Doing Body Beast together has brought us so much closer. We cook and plan meals together, talk about our goals, and since Ive gained so much confidence the intimacy has never been better.     Denise: In this day and age where everything is processed and no one pays attention to serving sizes, we take pride in knowing that our children see mommy and daddy exercising at home and cooking healthy meals every single day.  Our hope is that this lifestyle becomes normal and the kids can say its just what we do,because I have to admit, I didnt see that growing up and it took a lot of effort for me to get to this point.   David:  I would encourage other couples to work out together. There is an experience that happens during the workouts that is almost indescribable. When you workout alone, you may allow yourself to cheat on a rep or two, or take extra breaks. When you workout with your spouse  and  you set a goal together, you dont let the other slow down, or take that break, or cheat on a rep. This is the one occasion where you d ont get in trouble for yelling at your spouse. (Come on! You got this! Keep going! I dont stop, so you dont stop!) You push one another to the max and the bond that is created through that process is better than any weekend getaway or vacation! When as a couple, you can unite on a common goal and organize your life around accomplishing that goal, you realize s o many things about yourself and your relationship. You start to see how creating those habits of planning the workouts, the meals, and going through the pains and struggles together forces you to rely on each other for support. It has created a special bond for us, a story that we can be proud to tell and continue to write every day.   Denise: Were preparing for our second trip to the Classic stage as we speak. And guess what our go to program is? Thats right Body Beast! I cannot stress enough how Body Beast has improved my marriage. It came into our lives when we needed it the most. It not only helped us improve our physical appearance, it showed us how to get through difficult times by pushing our limitations and cheering each other on. A lot of married couples tend to forget about each other, especially after having children. Working out together is something I encourage every couple to do. Theres a new bonding experience and shortly thereafter, the intimacy improves because theyre experiencing something together.     Congratulations to Dave and Denise for setting a goal together, working toward it together, and then standing on stage and competing together!

INSANITY Results: Andrew Lost 130 Pounds and Won $1,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/insanity-results-andrew-lost-130-pounds,"Andrew Eckman, age 30, lost 130 lbs. with  INSANITY . He entered his results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,500!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I have always battled my weight. In high school, I hit the weights pretty hard, and I was around 240 poundswhen I graduated. I always tried to stay bulked up for football. Twelveyears passed by and I found myself up to nearly 340 pounds and hated everything about my body. I was in a size 44 pants and a 3XL shirt (and these were starting to get too small). I always had a desire to get fit, but just couldnt get the motivation to do it. I had tried 100 different times, succeeded a few of the times, but then just put the weight back on, plus more, a few months into it. I was concerned about getting high blood pressure and sleep apnea, and was literally embarrassed by my size. 3   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  It was in November of 2015 that I decided to make a change. I had just turned 29, and I told my wife that I wanted to be in the best shape of my life on my 30th birthday, which was October 26, 2016. Many things inspired me to make this change. I wanted to be healthier for my family, and even more for myself. Ive always been the active type, and I was to the point where I didnt want to do anything but sit on the couch. The day it hit me like a ton of bricks was a fall day last year. Im a high school teacher and head high school basketball coach. I had taken my students to a theme park for a school trip. We waited in line for about 45 minutes to get on a rollercoaster. When weget to our turn to get on, I sit down and try to buckle the strap. It wont go around me, and I have to get off in front of hundredsof people. I was humiliated and hated myself for allowing myself to get this big. I decided that day that it was time to make a change!     What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  My biggest challenge was motivation. I didnt want to do anything but lie on the couch. When I popped in that DVD of INSANITY, I thought, There is no way! I did the fit test, and I thought I was going to die! Day after day I continued to put the DVD in, and I pushed myself to keep doing it. It was tough, but I made myself do it. I was inspired by Shaun T, and wanted to keep working to try and get the body that I had always dreamed of. This program pushes you hard, makes you sweat, and you see results. I couldnt be happier being 130 pounds lighter and leaner than Ive ever been. I turned 30 just a few days ago, and I am in the best shape of my life! I reached my goal thanks to INSANITY!   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I really enjoy the intense exercising. After I am done with my workout, I am pouring sweat, my muscles are burning, and I feel good about myself! I feel like I get a good workout in every time I do it! It pushes me each and every day!   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  My weight loss is the biggest thing that I am proud of. I was downright  fat  before this! I am also proud of the muscle I have gained too! I feel like I am leaner than I have ever been. It has taken a lot of work and discipline, but it is definitely worth it!   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  My life is completely different. I am actually proud of my body instead of being embarrassed of it. Before, I was embarrassed to take my shirt off in front of my wife. I have the best wife in the world, and she always has shown me more love every day, no matter my size. She has supported me through this journey, and allows me time to get my workout in and prepare my meals each day. I want to continue to try and be the best husband and father that I can be, and I know this weight loss will help me do that.   You can change your life, too.

The Beginner’s Guide to Losing Weight With Beachbody
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/the-beginners-guide-to-losing-weight-with-beachbody,"My name is Rebecca and I love cheese. Im also a digital marketing professional, freelance writer, wife, dog mom of two, and I drive 70 miles round-trip to work every day. So you could say Im a little busy.   A year ago, I was a weight-loss newbie, but even I know that fad diets dont work. Sure, you can go on a kale-and-quinoa bender to drop pounds fast, but you cant keep that going forever. Getting  and staying  healthy and fit is about a lifestyle change, not Im not eating carbs this month!   So Im here to tell you about that time I lost weight with  Beachbodys 21 Day Fix  and more importantly, how I didnt have to give up  my life  cheese.   I found out first-hand why 21 Day Fix and  all of Beachbodys programs  work: They help you lose weight and get in shape now AND give you the tools to stay that way for good.      How I Got Started      Last year, I was getting ready for my wedding. I didnt have a huge amount of weight to lose, but I did want to get toned for the dress. Id never seriously tried to lose weight before; the most I had accomplished was meandering around the gym a few times.   So, of course, I started eating lots of salad and taking a few classes at the gym. Done and done, right? Well, I did see a slight change, but I really had no idea what I was doing. I needed structure and a plan that would fit into my crazy-busy schedule: Enter 21 Day Fix.   The first step was making myself a priority. I made a deal with myself: Get serious for 21 days and if the program didnt work, then Id never do it again.      How it Worked      I followed  the meal plan  to a T, worked out every single day for 21 days (yes, that actually happened), and felt absolutely awesome.   I loved the physical results, but 21 days of eating clean and focusing on my own health did amazing things for my mind. I was more motivated at work, felt great in jeans, and I was happier in general. And the most important part  I ate cheese almost every day.   After one round of the program at 100 percent and two more rounds at 80/20 (80 percent eating clean, 20 percent eating what I wanted), I lost four inches and nine pounds, which looked more like 15. During those three months, I drank margs in Mexico, ate late-night chicken fingers in Tahoe, celebrated friends birthdays with pizza, and all the fun things I didnt want to give up.   Thats why the 21 Day Fix works  its about making sustainable changes in how you eat, not a crash diet with temporary results. You can get the body you want and  eat your cheese, too. If youre ready to lose weight the right way  and keep it off  heres all the info you need to get started.     What IS Beachbody?      Youre probably thinking,  Hmm, isnt that the company with the infomercials?  Yep, thats the one.   But heres what you probably didnt know:  Beachbody is a fitness, nutrition, and weight-loss company  thats been around since 1998. It has produced more than 400 workout programs with Super Trainers like Tony Horton, Shaun T, and Autumn Calabrese.   Its the company that created fitness and nutrition programs like  P90X ,  INSANITY ,  CORE DE FORCE , and of course, 21 Day Fix. Its also the birthplace of  Shakeology , the  Beachbody Performance  line, and my favorite,  Beachbody On Demand , an online streaming platform.   Its changed millions of lives with a huge selection of health and fitness solutions for  real  people with  real  lives, and  real  affinities for eating blocks of cheddar at midnight (like me).      How Do I Lose Weight With 21 Day Fix?      The concept is simple: Eat right and work out.  But I could just do that myself , you might say. Okay, then why  arent  you doing it? Because its much easier said than done.   This program takes a seemingly simple concept and provides you with two key tools:   1. A portion-controlled eating plan to lose weight.   2. Challenging and doable 30-minute workouts to get fit.     The Weight-Loss Eating Plan   It all starts with a  set of color-coded containers  that tell you how much fruits, veggies, fats, protein, and carbs you should eat every day for your specific daily calorie target.   I refuse to count calories, but Im all about counting colorful containers with food inside of them. And the best thing is that its real food that  you  choose. Hate quinoa and kale? Dont eat them. The 21 Day Fix program comes with a list of approved foods that will satisfy all palates. (Plus, you can put wine in the yellow containers. Just saying.)     The Workout Plan   The 30-minute workouts provide the perfect combination of cardio and strength training to build muscle and burn fat in 21-day intervals. Whether youve never worked out a day in your life or you live in the gym, these workouts are safe and challenging for all fitness levels.   When I started, I could barely do three push-ups on my knees. By the end, I was doing a full  minute  of traditional push-ups and couldnt stop flexing my guns in the mirror.      What Is Beachbody On Demand?      Its exactly what it sounds like: Streaming workouts from your laptop, tablet, TV, or mobile device. Think Netflix, but for fitness and nutrition.   Even better, you can get an  annual membership for $99.95  (less than $10 a month) that includes access to  every single program  Beachbody has ever created. You also get access to any new programs, and theyre always coming out with more. Thats 500+ workouts and counting.   In just one week, you can do cardio,  weight training ,  yoga , mixed martial arts, dance,  tai chi , and a  Pilates/yoga combo  all in your living room or wherever you like to work out. Thats $100/month  less  than it costs for a gym or studio class membership.   Pro tip:  Not so nimble in the kitchen? You can also stream Autumn Calabreses  FIXATE cooking show , and learn how to make clean, portion-controlled meals.      What Programs Are Right for Me?      Beachbody has a huge library of programs, and if you dont know which one to do first, theres program match tool that will help you find the one(s) that work for you. Want to build muscle? Try  Body Beast  or  22 Minute Hard Corps . Prefer to dance off the weight? Work out to  CIZE  or  Country Heat . Just select a category that matches your goal or interests  cardio, muscle building, yoga, low impact, dance, etc.  then pick a program from the list and go!   All the workouts are designed by certified fitness pros and all the nutrition programs are created by nutrition experts. Each program can produce dramatic results, but results dont happen without hard work. Take it one program at a time  this isnt a race, its the start of a healthier lifestyle."

Transformation Tuesday: Michael Lost 102 Pounds With FOCUS T25
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/before-and-after-results/focus-t25-results,"Michael lost 102 pounds and 12 inches after committing to  FOCUS T25  for 52 weeks! Ashamed of his body and lack of endurance, he decided to start working out for himself and his children. Heres what he has to say about his journey.   My story begins in the summer of 2013. I started to feel ashamed of myself when I was at an amusement park celebrating my sons 5th birthday. I wasnt allowed down a waterslide because I was too big. My son was crying because I couldnt go down with him, and there was a line of frustrated people behind us. After that, I kept falling into a deep depression. I continued eating and smoking cigarettes. Having to purchase clothing at the big and tall section was embarrassing.   One night while channel surfing I stumbled upon the FOCUS T25 infomercial. Seeing all the transformations was getting me emotional. Finally, I decided that I was going to start working out. My goal, just like most people, was to lose weight.   Did I regret starting FOCUS T25? Not one bit! I was shocked that I completed the Alpha Phase because I was never consistent with anything positive in my life. After completing the Beta Phase I felt like I wanted to take on the world. I felt amazing! I felt stronger and younger. Interval training of just 25 minutes is so much more effective than running on a treadmill for an hour!   Before, I was in no shape at all. I was round and could barely breathe. Now, Im in the best shape of my life! Im down 102 pounds! I am filled with energy, stamina, and endurance. I feel confident wherever I go and am able to shop at regular sections at department stores. No more Big and Tall clothes for me!   Not only has Beachbody saved my life, but it has inspired me to be a coach for my sons soccer team. Also, it has taught me to be disciplined, to stick with a workout program, and finish it. Ive applied this same concept to my work and personal lives and it has made me a better person!   Results vary based on starting point and effort.   <hr />   <strong>You can change your life, too.

10 Creative Ways to Use Ice Cube Trays
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/creative-ways-to-use-ice-cube-trays,"Chances are youve only used ice cube trays to freeze water, and thats cool, but this under-utilized kitchen tool has a lot more potential when it comes to healthy eating and reducing food waste.   Not only can you use ice cube trays to capture ingredients at their freshest (adios, powdered garlic) but you can also use them as a portioning tool as most hold about one tablespoon per well. Ready to get freezing?   Here are 10 smart ways to fully appreciate your ice cube trays.      1. Pesto   Dont let  homemade pesto  go to waste. Instead, freeze it into individual ice cube-sized portions. Once the pesto fully freezes, pop out the cubes and store them in an air-tight bag or container to free up the tray. Then, when a pasta dish, roasted vegetable, or  egg recipe  calls for pesto, simply pop the frozen cube into a pan to defrost it.   2. Tomato paste   As luck would have it, many recipes call for just a tablespoon or two of tomato paste. Instead of tossing whats left over or freezing it in a big chunk in the can, separate the extra paste into individual portions. Coat an ice cube tray with non-stick spray and scoop one tablespoon of tomato paste into each well. Use the cubes as needed to add flavor and depth to  soups , sauces, and casseroles.   3. Herbs   Tired of using dried herbs when a recipe calls for the fresh version? Freeze fresh basil, cilantro, parsley, mint, and other herbs. Fill an ice cube tray about three quarters of the way with chopped herbs, then cover with water, oil, or  broth . While the  herbs appearance will change , their flavor will not.     4. Minced garlic or ginger   Theres nothing fun about chopping up garlic and ginger every time you want to add aromatics to a dish. The next time a recipe calls for ginger or garlic, chop the whole garlic bulb or ginger root, and freeze whatever you doing use in an ice cube tray. Most recipes dont call for large amounts of these ingredients, so consider using a smaller tray to create smaller portions. Add some oil or water to the well so the chopped pieces bind together. Once frozen, store the cubes in an air-tight bag or container in the freezer. Incorporate the flavorful cubes into  soups , stews, and  veggie dishes .   5. Lemon and lime juice and zest   Fresh lemons and limes are great, until they sit in the fridge too long and dry out. Squeeze out the juice when the citrus fruits are fresh, and then freeze it in an ice cube tray. Use the cubes in  main dishes , or use them to flavor cocktails,  water , and seltzer. You can also save the zest of the citrus fruits, by filling the ice cube well with the shredded rind and adding a bit of the juice to hold it together.   6. Coffee   To prevent the buzzkill that is diluted coffee, freeze cooled, freshly-brewed coffee into cubes. Toss them into home-brewed iced coffee for a morning glass of Joe that wont get watered down by regular ice.     7. Wine   The same principle applies here: Watered-down wine (or warm white wine for that matter) isnt exactly ideal. Avoid diluting your vino by using  wine cubes , or add frozen wine cubes to  homemade sangria .   8. Eggs   Bought too many eggs? Freeze them before they go bad. Scramble whole eggs or egg whites, then  freeze in an ice cube tray . When its time to use them, take out as many cubes as you need, thaw them in a refrigerator, and cook them up as soon as they have defrosted.   9. No-bake energy bites   For a healthy snack or a not-too-filling breakfast before a morning workout, opt for no-bake energy balls. Whip up a batch, like these  birthday cake or carrot cake  energy balls, and freeze the leftovers into an ice cube tray. This will help them last longer, and theyll be a cold and refreshing treat thats easy to take on the go. However, the calories will be slightly different than those in the recipes if the portion size isnt the same.   10. Single-serve desserts   Need a little something to satisfy your sweet tooth? Freeze single-serve desserts, such as  peanut butter cups  and  no-bake cookies  into separate wells based on the recipes serving size. Before dinner, pop one out and let it defrost a bit in the refrigerator while you eat, then enjoy it after your meal is over. Bonus: Because the dessert stays in the freezer, itll be out of sight and out of mind.   Have you ever used your ice cube tray to freeze foods? Let us know in the comment section below!"

Four Kinds of Cycling Workouts (and Why You Should Be Doing All of Them)
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/performance-sports-science/four-kinds-of-cycling-workouts-and-why-you-should-be-doing-all-of-them,"Serious cyclists are creatures of habit. We religiously get up before sunrise, hit the head, chug a cup of Joe, throw on our kit, and head out for a group ride. The route and pace are almost always the same: Twenty to 40 miles (longer on weekends) at a pace that works up a sweat but doesnt interfere with friendly conversations and griping about cars.   If youre one of those dedicated dawn patrollers, we salute you. By constantly rising to the occasion, you consistently pack in more exercise before breakfast than most Americans do, well, ever. But we can also tell you that, in all likelihood, that daily, unchanging group ride is holding you back. Why? Because if youre only logging miles, youll never reach your full athletic potential.   Whether you ride to race or simply to improve overall fitness, that congenial morning coffee ride occasionally needs to be turned into a double espresso, handlebar-chewing throw down. No matter what your talent or goal, the path to improvement always involves changing things up, says Ron Peterson, a USA Cycling certified coach and owner of Peterson Training, in Redondo Beach, California. When you constantly stress your body the same way, it eventually stops adapting and progress stagnates.   The four workouts in this article will help prevent that from happening. In addition to injecting critical variety into your training program, each type of workoutfrom a one-hour tempo ride to a 30-minute interval sessionwill help you develop a different skill that can help you not only nail a new PR, but also build a leaner, faster, more powerful body. But first things firstbefore you jump into the workouts, you need to figure out two key variables: Your training objective and the training intensity that will guide each workout. So lets get to it.   STEP 1: Identify Your Goal   Are you riding to become a stronger competitor or to improve overall fitness? The answer to that question will determine how often you perform each type of workout detailed in Step 3 (long slow distance, tempo, sweet spot, and short interval). Whether its a road race, gran fondo, century, bike tour, or dropping 15 pounds by your next birthdayset a goal that can be marked down on a calendar, says Peterson. Then give yourself at least four months to achieve it.   If your goal is to improve fitness  During your first two months, do a couple of long slow distance rides each week along with a tempo workout and a couple of  strength training  sessions (yes, even endurance-minded folks should pump iron). In month three, swap a weekly strength session for a sweet spot workout. In month four, change things up even more: Do one tempo ride, one sweet spot workout, one short interval session, one long distance ride, and one strength-training workout each week.   If your goal is to become a stronger competitor  During your first two months of your off season, focus on building your basea couple of two-hour rides and one or two strength training sessions during the week, and a couple of three-hour rides on weekends (or longer if you dont have to take your kid to an afternoon soccer game). In month three, start tailoring your training to your cycling niche. Climbers should aim for two sweet spot workouts and two recovery (read: easy LSD) rides each week, adding a short interval workout to the mix when youre four weeks out from race day. Sprinters should focus on speed work. Do two short-interval workouts per week, along with one tempo or sweet spot workout, and two recovery rides. Both groups should also continue to do at least one strength training session per week.   Step 2: Test Yourself   To perform your workouts effectively, youll need to determine one of two key training metrics for gauging exercise intensity: Lactate threshold heart rate (LTHR) or functional threshold power (FTP).   Contrary to popular belief, lactate (sometimes referred to mistakenly as lactic acid) isnt the cause of that deep muscle burn you feel late in a race or toward the end of a grueling workout. Its a buffering agent that helps neutralize the hydrogen ions that accumulate in muscles during aerobic (oxygen fueled) energy production. The buildup of those ions is what causes acidosis (AKA the burn).   Your lactate threshold is the point at which you begin producing more hydrogen ions than you can effectively neutralize, and your LTHR represents the exercise intensity (in beats per minute) that will cause you to reach that point. Threshold power is essentially the same point of no return, but its identified in watts instead of beats per minute. The maximum power that a cyclist can sustain for one hour is his or her FTP.   To determine your LTHR youll need a heart rate monitor, preferably in the form of a chest strap, which is typically more accurate than a wrist-based biometric sensor (i.e., the kind integrated into a watch). To determine FTP youll need a power meter, which attaches to your bike. You can use either metric (LTHR or FTP) to gauge exercise intensity, but elite cyclists generally prefer FTP because it tends to be more accurate. But whichever metric you choose, the test remains the same: Pop your bike in a trainer or find a stretch of road with a slight uphill and no stops that takes at least 30 minutes to ascend. Warm up for 15 minutes at an easy pace, and then ride for 30 minutes at a pace that that challenges you to complete the ride. If youre wearing a heart rate monitor, average your heart rate from the final 20 minutes to determine your LTHR. If youre using a power meter, average your power from the full 30 minutes, and then multiply that number by .95 to determine your FTP. Re-test yourself every three weeksas you become fitter, your LTHR and FTP will inch higher.   Step 3: Begin Training   Youve determined your goal, identified a training plan, and figured out your LTHR or FTP. Now the fun begins. Add the following workouts to your training schedule as described in Step 1.   Workout 1: Long Slow Distance   Intensity:  65 to 84 percent of LTHR, 55 to 75 percent of FTP   Duration:  Two to three hours   Purpose:  To develop raw endurance   The first phase of any smart periodized training plan (i.e., one divided into blocks that focus on specific goals or skills) is to build or reinforce a strong aerobic base. So regardless of whether youre a noob or a veteran, youre going to spend a couple of months doing long slow distance (LSD), also commonly referred to as foundation or base miles.   The goal is to increase the amount of work your body can do before becoming fatigued, says Peterson. Youre teaching your body to use fat [instead of glucose] as its go-to fuel source, and thats huge.   Huge because, for all intents and purposes, your body has an almost limitless supply of fateven if youre an elite competitor. That makes it a preferable fuel to glucose, which is easier to burn, but stored in more limited quantities. But to access fat as fuel, and to teach your body to burn blubber more efficiently, your heart rate needs to stay out of the red (lactate threshold) zone.   Keep your pace conversational, advises Peterson. If you find it difficult to speak more than a sentence or two at a time, dial it back. You should be peddling hard enough to work up a sweat, but not so hard that talking becomes difficult.   Workout 2: Tempo Ride   Intensity:  85 to 91 percent of LTHR, 75 to 84 percent of FTP   Duration:  One hour   Purpose:  To increase your capacity for high-intensity effort (i.e., go harder for longer)   Often described as sustainable discomfort, tempo pace is the hardest intensity you can sustain for one hour while remaining aerobic (i.e., producing energy from glucose or fat in the presence of oxygen). The goal is to condition your body to perform for prolonged periods at intensities that approach your lactate threshold.   Although beneficial during any phase of training, tempo rides are particularly important toward the end of the base-building phase, says Peterson, as they help prepare your body for the transition from straight LSD to training that includes shorter, harder speed work (i.e., intervals). You can either do a tempo session at the end of an LSD ride (simply ramp up your pace during the last hour), or perform a dedicated, hour-long tempo workout. Either way, its important that you perform the ride with as few interruptions as possible. Youre teaching your body to sustain high-intensity effort; this is no time to rest.   Workout 3: Sweet Spot Training   Intensity:  91 to 95 percent of LTHR, 85 to 90 percent of FTP   Duration:  About an hour   Purpose:  To increase both endurance and functional threshold power   Efforts between tempo pace and lactate threshold fall into what coaches refer to as the sweet spot, as training in this zone (usually in the form of long intervals) provides an ideal balance of intensity and volume for increasing that most critical of performance metrics: Functional threshold power. In short, sweet spot training (SST) helps increase the speed and power you can sustain during high intensity exercise. I am a big fan of the sweet spot, says Peterson. You get a lot of bang for your buck, and its nowhere near as fatiguing as training at threshold.   Pick a stretch of road thats flat or has a steady 3 to 5 percent grade. Do three 15-minute intervals at the intensity mentioned above, recovering at an easy cadence for seven to eight minutes between each one. The interval pace should be hard enough so that talking becomes nearly impossible, says Peterson. About 10 beats below your threshold heart rate.   Workout 4: Short Intervals   Intensity:  95 to 105 percent of LTHR, 91 to 120 percent of FTP   Duration:  30 Minutes   Purpose:  To improve aerobic capacity, cellular energy production, power generation, endurance, stamina (exercise tolerance), and speed   Welcome to the red zone. For this workout, youre going to exercise above your lactate threshold, and its going to burn like hell. If it were a CrossFit class, youd learn to embrace the suck.   Most cyclists can only peddle for five-minute stretches at the intensity required for these intervals, and then kaboomout go the lights. But the pain is worth the payoff: New riders can improve their VO2-max (the maximum amount of oxygen their bodies can utilize during intense efforts), and experienced riders can boost their power and speed when operating at their lactate threshold. Whats more, all levels of cyclist can improve endurance. Indeed, short, intense interval workouts can increase  raw endurance  just as much as long distance rides, according to a study in the  Journal of Physiology.   If your primary goal is to lose weight,  the benefits of interval training  are just as enticing, as research shows it can it help you lose more body fat than with steady state cardio.   So how do you go about reaping these rewards? Perform two to four intervals, each of which should encompass four minutes of hard effort (at the intensity mentioned above) and four minutes of active rest, during which you bring your cadence down to that of a leisurely ride.   Youll get the greatest benefit if you peddle as hard as you can, recover, and then do the next one just as hard, says Peterson. In short, dont skimp on rest. If you dont recover sufficiently between intervals, your training effect (i.e., your adaptations from exercise) will be diminished. Indeed, being smart about how you perform each workout is just as important as incorporating all of them into your training program."

How to Cope with Emotional Eating
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/how-to-cope-with-emotional-eating,"How many times have you eaten not because you were physically hungry, but because you were stressed, tired, bored, anxious, angry, or (insert appropriate emotion here)?   Many of us have been taught that food can soothe a mood, that shoveling scoops of Ben & Jerrys straight out of the pint can help dull the ache of a breakup. Comfort food  those warm, salty, melty bites of mac and cheese, for instance  preys upon our inability to say no thanks when we seek a reward or feel stressed.   When we use food to appease our moods, it sets us up for a vicious cycle of possible weight gain, followed by self-recrimination, followed by more emotional eating. But, I want to assure you that  you can and you will  stop this cycle if you learn a few simple tools.     Are You An Emotional Eater?   How do you know if youre eating for emotional reasons? Try this self-test. For the following Answer each of the following five questions with a simple yes or no.     Do you eat between meals even when youre not physically hungry?   If you eat between meals, are you eating on auto-pilot  i.e., mindlessly and without complete awareness and attention to what youre actually doing?   When something upsetting happens, do you reach for the nearest bag of cookies to make yourself feel better?   Do you fantasize about foods that are your special treats such as chocolate cake or kettle chips?   When you eat these treats, do you hide out and eat them by yourself because youre embarrassed to eat them in front of others?     If you answered yes to more than two of the above, you may be an emotional eater. When you want to eat when youre not physically hungry, close your eyes, take a deep breath, and ask yourself:     What am I feeling and why?   What do I really need besides food right now? (Hint: Its often rest or a break from what youre doing)     The healthy alternatives offered below may help you begin to escape the cycle.     Three of the Emotional States That Lead to Emotional Eating   Sadness, anxiety, and anger are the three emotional states I see most often among my patients that can lead to bouts of emotional eating. Some people eat to celebrate (hello, birthday cake), to quell boredom (think mindless snacking while watching TV), to reward themselves (I just ran 7 miles, so I can eat a fully-loaded cheeseburger and fries), but when it comes to patterns of emotional eating, I see them stem most from sadness, anxiety, or anger.     Sad Eating   Lets face it: When heartbreak or loneliness hits, eating that tub of ice cream seems like a good idea. A bit of sweetness to drown out the sorrow Before you know it, youre caught in a self-perpetuating negative cycle that can be very difficult to escape. You eat because youre sad, then you feel even more blue because youve eaten so much. This can lead to a what-the-heck attitude, increasing the likelihood of overeating when the next bout of the blues strikes.   Healthy alternatives to sad eating:   1.  Express yourself:  Your melancholy mood was probably caused by an upsetting incident. Get it off your chest by talking about it with someone you trust. If nobody is available to talk, try writing down your feelings.   2.  Move:  Battle the blues by moving your body and getting your heart pumping. Even doing 30 minutes of moderate  exercise can boost the feel-good chemicals in your brain .   3.  Give yourself permission to let it out:  Light some candles, take a hot bath, listen to sad music, cry until you run out of tears. Allowing yourself to feel sad will help you process. Or, put on headphones, turn up the music, and dance, or punch pillows pick a constructive way to emote thats not eating.     Anxious/Stress Eating   Many of us eat to relieve our stress or anxiety. Research points out that  emotional distress increases the intake of specific foods   in particular, those that are high in fat, sugar, or both. An excessive intake of these types of  highly palatable foods shares similarities with the effects on brain and behavior that are seen with some drugs  of abuse, according to research published in the journal  Nutrition .   Healthy alternatives to anxiety/stress eating:   1.  Stick to a regular,  healthy sleep routine .  If youre not sleeping well because youre stressed, the lack of sleep can result in poor food choices. Research shows that people who got  insufficient sleep for several consecutive nights increased food intake to keep them going . When they returned to getting adequate rest, they stopped eating as much  particularly carbs and fats.   2.  Do something relaxing and calming.  We all have different ways of relaxing. The next time you feel stressed and anxious and instinctively turn to food, resist the urge to run to the cupboard or fridge, and instead practice a relaxing activity. Consider trying  meditation ,  yoga , or even just pause for a moment to  take some deep breaths .     Angry Eating   Unfortunately when we stuff our anger down with food this doesnt get rid of our anger. It simply buries it. If we dont deal with the emotion, it will keep popping up.   Healthy alternatives to angry eating   One way to get out of the angry eating trap is to delay eating  even 10 minutes will do  and to sit down, take a deep breath, and tune into what youre really feeling. Ask yourself the following questions and patiently work your way through the answers.     What happened today that may have made me angry?   Why did that event stir up angry feelings?   What do I need to do in order to let go of this anger and feel peaceful?"

How to Make Eating Right Feel Like Less of a Struggle
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/how-to-make-eating-right-feel-like-less-of-a-struggle,"Eating healthy can feel overwhelming  and  complicated  and  challenging.   Low carb, organic, whole grains, gluten free, vegan, Paleo, low fat, keto, and eating for your body type all the options can make your head spin! You want something thats going to work, and you want it yesterday.   The reality: Putting in the work to eat well requires a least a little bit of effort. Theres no one-size-fits-all approach to health; what might work great for some wont work for the next person. If some of the following healthy-eating struggles sound familiar, youre not alone. Well help you sort through the issues so you can find an individualized approach that works for you.     7 Common Struggles On the Road to Eating Healthy      Youre not sure how to eat healthy.   If you didnt grow up eating a balanced diet with healthy foods, figuring out which foods are healthy and how to cook them can feel like a major roadblock.   Youre not alone. When you start eating healthy, its normal to be concerned about whether or not food will taste good, how to cook it, or even what to buy at the grocery or order off the restaurant menu. Ease yourself in. Consider trying one new food a week or making just one or two  healthy recipes  your first few weeks. You may also want to start watching  cooking shows  or consider consulting with a registered dietitian to build your food confidence.      Eating healthy is more expensive.   You may have said or heard these comments before: Fresh fruits and veggies go bad so fast. Eating organic drains the pocket book. It all just seems so expensive.   If you cant afford to buy all-organic produce, thats totally OK. Be selective about the ones you can shell out more for; the clean/dirty produce list can help guide you to discover what produce you should prioritize purchasing to suit you and your familys preferences. If you cant afford to buy organic at all,  the clean/dirty produce list  can help as well because at least you can make the majority of your non-organic produce purchases from the clean list.   Buying in-season produce can also help you save money, and it tastes better. Frozen fruits and veggies can also be easier on the wallet, are just as healthy as fresh (theyre flash frozen at their peak of ripeness)  and  can help you cut down on food waste. Instead of crushed ice or cubes, use frozen fruit in smoothies. Instead of wilting raw spinach or kale leaves into soups, use boxes of frozen spinach or chopped frozen kale. Youre cooking the greens for a longer amount of time anyway, so you dont need the fresh-from-the-garden taste of raw greens.   Ill admit, I will buy a lot of healthy convenience items, such as pre-chopped veggies and energy bars and while I may be paying a few more dollars at the check out line, this helps me to actually  use  the veggies before they go bad, and it saves time in the prep department. But, this is something I prioritize in my budget, as I have a toddler and not a lot of time to spend on food prep.     You hate grocery shopping.   Some people legitimately hate going to the grocery store. But good news theres an app for that. With the growing number of grocery delivery services  even Amazon has jumped on this gravy train with Prime Now  you can order on your phone or computer and schedule your groceries to be delivered at a time thats convenient for you. And there is evidence that shows  preordering food may actually help you eat healthier .     Unhealthy food marketing is inescapable.   Scroll through Pinterest and youll see double stuffed cookie dough pie and slutty brownie bars swirled with marshmallows, all tempting us to feel like we  need  chocolate. We all know where the office candy jar is and where to find the box of donuts or cookies or birthday cake.   Be the change you want to see. Provide a healthier solution and bring in a batch of homemade (and healthy shhh, dont advertise this, and see if anybody notices)  Flourless Brownie Cupcakes with Peanut Butter Frosting  for the next birthday celebration, or  No-Bake Cinnamon Sugar Donut Holes  to that next early morning meeting, or if you dont have time to whip up homemade snacks,  stash these in your desk  so that when your stomach growls, you wont head to the candy jar or vending machine.     You feel like you dont have the time to eat healthy.   Eating healthy might seem like it takes more time than running through the drive-thru. However, taking just one or two hours to meal prep on the weekend will save you rushing around to figure out breakfast, lunch, or dinner all week! Three cheers for less stress, right?   Healthy meal planning is easier that it seems.  Beachbodys meal plans  provide a wealth of inspiration (including some meal plans that will set you up for five days of success and take  less than 90 minutes from start to finish ) and  21 Day Fix  creator Autumn Calabrese and her brother chef Bobby Calabrese walk you through the basics of meal prep in a video from their new  FIXATE cooking series .     Youre afraid of trying a recipe that might fail.   So you find a new recipe you want to try and then you cook it. Maybe you enjoy it, but all the kids (and the husband) turn up their noses. And you get a whole bunch of whining and complaining. Its tempting to want to throw in the towel and go back to the usual recipes you know they will enjoy.   But stay the course! Try cooking foods in different ways. So you dont like raw onions well, try them caramelized. Dont like steamed broccoli? Try roasting it. The cooking method can greatly alter the taste of foods. Hint:  All  veggies taste better roasted.     You have FOMO.   The fear of missing out can be strong when all-or-nothing thinking creeps in, and you focus on what you sacrifice to eat healthy (instead of what you gain).   But, eating well doesnt mean you have to be perfect  thats nonsense. Even those who eat healthy most of the time have their cheat meals. Thats why Beachbody supports a 80-20 strategy. Theres no missing out when you allow yourself to enjoy everything in moderation.   Yes, you can still eat cheeseburgers and brownies, just not every day!

6 Ways to Hit the Reset Button and Get Fit (Again)​
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/weight-loss/6-ways-to-hit-the-reset-button-and-get-fit-again%e2%80%8b,"Exercise or ice cream? Exercise or ice cream?   But of course, ice cream.   I havent worked out in a while. And the less I do, the less inclined I am to do so. But in my heart of hearts, I know the longer I dont exercise, the harder it feels to get back to it. But Im determined to do it. Especially since I know that if I want to get back on the health wagon, its all in my mind.   Here are some mental reset tricks Ive used in the past that have worked for me. You may find they work for you too!     6 Strategies for Getting Fit Again   The past? What past?  Sometimes it seems like the weight of all my sins  quite literally  are too much to bear. Most recently, it was the month of drinking (hey, it was my birthday!), followed by late-night snacking (ditto!) and morning hair of the dog (with the snacking, not the drinking). Just thinking about it makes me want to climb into bed and order UberEATS. But I have to to let go of my (overindulgent) past and start anew.   But also, remember the past:  Yes, it is a new day, but I  do  have a past. One where I was eating healthy, waking up early, exercising, and feeling good about all of it. If I take a few minutes to meditate, I can almost imagine myself back on my old schedule of healthy eating and working out. (i.e you want to forget your less-than-perfect past but  not  your angelic one.)   Just put on your shoes:  When I first started training for a marathon, one of the trainers told me an important trick: Just focus on the first step. So when I woke up groggy at 6:30 a.m. (why does it always have to be so early), I would think,  Just put your on your shoes, you dont have to go anywhere. You can put on your shoes, cant you?  I could. Id plunk my feet on the floor and lace up my shoes. With my shoes on, it was ridiculous to wear pajamas, so Id get dressed and ready.  Just go outside , Id then tell myself.  You dont have to go running, just stand on your porch.  Of course, I would be dressed and standing on my porch, watching everyone else out and about.  Might as well start running , Id think. (You wouldnt think this mind trick would work day after day. But it hasnt failed me yet.)   Believe that healthy will become a habit:  Some people form a habit in 21 days. For others, it may take longer. Recent research suggests  it can take people anywhere from 18 to 254 days to form a habit . The researchers found that, people are reassured to learn that doing the behavior gets progressively easier; so they only have to maintain their motivation until the habit forms. The journal found that  working hard for 23 months on instilling a new behavior  is attractive if those doing it know it has a chance of becoming second nature. And it does!   The real trick to habit forming:  Remove all obstacles. Shawn Anchor, happiness guru and author of  The Happiness Advantage: The Seven Principles of Positive Psychology That Fuel Success and Performance at Work  says that by taking his guitar out of his closet and putting it on a stand in plain sight, he was able to make practice a daily habit (even though taking the guitar out of the closet only took an extra 20 seconds.)   Thats why when I was running, I left my sneakers near my bed. Come summer, when I swim in the morning, I pack my goggles, swim cap, and towel the night before.   Another example of this:  In an experiment, Google put the M&Ms in their kitchens into opaque containers and put the healthier options in clear glass jars. They found that over a seven-week period, their 2,000-person New York office staff alone consumed 3.1 million fewer calories from M&Ms.   Go easy on yourself:  Its so easy to get into an all-or-nothing mindset, which is how I fell off the health wagon in the first place. Forgive yourself the ice cream. Health is not all or nothing. The addition of the healthy habits will soon outweigh the less-than-healthy ones and youll be back on the wagon in no time."

How to Breathe While Running
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/how-to-breathe-while-running,"Whether youre training for your first 5K or pounding the pavement for another 26.2 bumper sticker, one thing all runners have in common is oxygen. Breathing in and out is as natural as, well, breathing. When you go for a walk, you dont actively think about taking in oxygen and expelling carbon dioxide; it just happens.   So why does breathing feel more complicated when those legs get pumping? In the days when even a slow jog can leave you panting like a dog, your internal dialogue says you must be doing something wrong.   Turns out, you may be right.      Breathing Basics for More Efficient Running   Before you can get to the heart of better breathing, you should first understand why oxygen is so important not only to a runners lungs, but also to a runners muscles.   Your muscles need oxygen in order to fire, says Bill Bishop, head coach and founder of Chicagos Bishop Racing , who helps athletes achieve their competitive goals in running, swimming, cycling, and multi-sports. Your heart pumps blood, circulating it around the body and once oxygen enters the lungs, it passes through alveoli and into the blood, where its transported to muscle cells for use in cellular respiration, he explains.   The harder you run, the more oxygen your muscles need, says Bishop. Going harder or faster may feel like a far-off goal, especially if youre more focused on simply not passing out. But the good news is that no matter what your running goals may be, breathing better can get you there.        2 Schools of Thought on BreathingDuring Running   There are two main schools of thought when it comes to breathing and running: natural breathing and rhythmic breathing. Natural breathing is just as it sounds  breathing in a way that comes naturally to you.   A lot of new runners have a tendency to overthink it and get so analytical about their breathing patterns that they dont actually just relax and breathe, says Bishop, who says this can lead to hyperventilating.   Rhythmic breathing, on the other hand, relies on your natural inhales and exhales as a guide for foot strikes. The most common breathing rhythm of the well-trained runners Ive tested is a 2-2 rhythm, which means they take two steps while breathing in  one right foot step and one left foot step  and two steps breathing out, says running coach Jack Daniels, Ph.D., associate professor at A. T. Still University in Mesa, Arizona, and two-time Olympic medalist in the modern pentathlon.   Another effective rhythm is the five count (3-2) breath, says Beachbodys fitness and nutrition content manager Trevor Thieme, C.S.C.S. The goal here is to avoid beginning each exhalation on the same foot, he says, adding that when you breathe out, your diaphragm and the muscles around it relax, reducing core stability. If you begin each exhalation on the same foot, youll concentrate the impact forces on one side of your body; if you begin each exhalation on a different foot, as you will with the 3-2 rhythm, youll distribute those forces equally between both sides of your body, reducing your overall risk of injury.          The Best Breathing Style for You   While there are benefits to both styles of breathing, you wont know what works best for you until you give it a whirl.   Runners may think they are most comfortable with one method without ever trying another method, says Albert Rizzo, M.D., senior medical advisor to the American Lung Association and section chief at the Division of Pulmonary and Critical Care Medicine in Newark, Delaware. There may be advantages to looking into different styles of rhythmic running rather than running without ever pacing yourself.   While there are benefits to both styles of breathing, theres one common recommendation for all types of exercise breathing: Practice making your muscular diaphragm your primary breathing muscle, instead of your chest and neck muscles, which tend to be shallow and inefficient.   4 Tips for OptimalBreathing for Running, and Beyond   Whether natural or rhythmic is right for you, follow this expert advice to see results that leave you breathing a sigh of relief:     Dont Overdo It: If youre new to running , going out too hard and fast can set you back before you really get started. If you feel as though you cant catch your breath, slow down and walk it out. If youre really laboring, Rizzo recommends pursed-lip breathing, where your breathe in through the nose as if smelling the roses and then out through pursed lips as if blowing out birthday candles. This technique can often get you back into control and start to get rid of some of that panic setting in.       Nose vs. Mouth: Studies at the University of Arizona show breathing through your mouth when running may be easiest for beginner runners, especially, when compared to breathing through only your nose or using both your nose and mouth. (However, if you suffer from asthma or you are running in colder climates, Rizzo says nose breathing can help filter, warm, and moisturize the air to make for easier breathing all around.)       Change the Rhythm: Instead of a 2-2 or a 3-2 pace with rhythmic breathing, experiment with other patterns based on your workout and what feels best for your body. Daniels says, A slow rhythm 4-4, for instance, allows for larger breaths but fewer of them per minute. Keep it nice and steady.       Get Comfortable Being Uncomfortable: Like any new form of exercise, it takes a while for the body to feel OK. For newer runners, the first part of your runs are probably going to feel crappy, Bishop says with a laugh. Having a good handle on your breathing allows you to feel the least crappy in the phase when your body needs to get juiced up and ready to go. Sure enough, things will come around, and youll feel good at some point.          Do You Suffer From Side Stitches?   Side stitches are often a stabbing pain beneath your rib cage or along your side that comes during running and exercising. If you are familiar with the sudden side stitch, youre not alone: 70 percent of runners experienced this pain at least once during the 2014 year surveyed, according to research published in the New Zealand Journal of Medicine.   While scientists have explored the reasons for the side stitch and found a number of potential causes  including excess gas and digestive issues, restriction of blood flow, and an imbalance of electrolytes  the jury is still out on the precise reason for this exercise-induced discomfort.   To get relief, Bishop recommends easing the pain by either contracting your abdominals (try a bicycle crunch, for instance) or shift to short-fast inhales and longer exhales until the pain passes. Another option: Slow your pace, try applying firm pressure with your fingertips into the sore spot, and just wait it out."

Beachbody Results: Andrea Lost 155 Pounds!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-andrea-lost-155-pounds,"Andrea Barlow, age 31, lost 155 lbs with  Beachbody fitness programs  and the  Beachbody Performance supplements . She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $6,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  All of my life I felt like an outcast because of my weight. I felt limited in what I could do, wear, and where I could go. I felt ashamed of how I looked and avoided certain social situations like missing my senior prom because I was too ashamed to wear a dress. I avoided certain restaurants, movie theaters, and amusement parks in fear of not being able to fit into the seats. I felt helpless and hopeless when the day arrived that I couldnt fit into the drivers seat of my own car. I became very unhappy, sluggish, and short of breath every day. I was always on some kind of diet,continuously seeking for something to work; repeatedly losing the same 25-50 lbs. I felt as though it was impossible for someone like me with so much weight to lose, capable of sticking with something long enough to lose all of the weight. It was easier for me to deem my circumstances as final and believe that life was just meant to be riddled with obstacles and limitations.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  Every year we take our son to Christmas in Hershey Park for his birthday. I always occupied myself with taking pictures of him and his father, capturing all of the fun they were having together. On our way home from Kyles fourth birthday in Hershey, he asksMommy why dont you ever get on the rides with me like daddy does? I want to get on the rides with you too. I felt like I let my son down, and instead of responding with an answer that had another excuse. I told him Im sorry Mommy hasnt ever gotten on the rides with you, but next year I promise I will. The last day I spent trapped as my morbidly obese self, I sat in the room next to where my newborn daughter was sleeping, contemplating to end my life or not. I loved my family too much to leave them that way. In that moment I only had 2 choices; do nothing and continue to miss moments with my children, remaining miserable and trapped or do something about my situation once and for all. My family needed me to be stronger and healthier, and there was no reason I couldnt give them that other than doubt.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  Ive battled an eating disorder since I was 13. Trapped in a vicious cycle of feeling unhappy, anxious and helpless; binging on a lot of food to quickly fill myself with pleasure, feeling guilty for overeating and then purging as a solution to feel better, leaving me to feel extremely depressed. Every tragedy, adversity, failure, bored, and stressful moment was my reason to binge eat. A decade of working as a CNA caused significant disk degeneration in my back. At 28 I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism. My feet were ridden with deep fissures making walking and standing debilitating. 3  Beachbody workouts gave me a chance to break my vicious cycle by providing me an outlet to relieve stress. Everyday that I pushed play through my adversities, I learned how to be stronger mentally and in charge of my choices. I desperately needed the support provided by my Beachbody team to reach victories through adversity. My journey with Beachbody has taught me how to feel empowered and not powerless.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I had a very hectic schedule at times and working out at home was more convenient. 21 Day Fix helped me become successful at completing something since it only took 3 weeks to finish each round. The modified move options in 21 Day Fix made exercising at my heaviest less intimidating and doable. 21 Day Fix helped my back feel stronger to handle some of the more advanced programs. The Fix meal plan gave me structure in my unbalanced diet and helped me learn how to make smarter food choices. I began seeing food for what it could do for my body instead of how it could please me. In times of stress  Body Beast  helped me feel powerful again.  21 Day Fix EXTREME  helped me push progress to a higher level by intensifying a lot of the moves I had been doing in 21 Day Fix. These programs helped me build consistency in my exercise routine; something I previously lacked.   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I faced a lot of adversity during my journey and could have reciprocated with giving up and starting over like I always did before. When my hypothyroidism stalled progress I could have convinced myself the program wasnt working and gave up. When my infant daughter developed GI issues and surgery was a possibility I could have turned to my eating disorder to cope with stress. When my fiancs mom was hospitalized and diagnosed with end stage CHF and we had to renovate her home; discovering she became a hoarder, I could have turned to fast food and quit exercising. When my mom was rushed off for emergency surgery for a brain tumor, I could have used food to comfort my pain. I achieved losing 155 pounds through adversities that had the power to impede my journey. I did the hard through the hard. The mental and emotional strength I gained from using my program as an outlet to cope helped me break a lifetime of habits. The result is a new life, ability to overcome hardship, and achieve power over my life.     How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  My life has been renewed. I dont go to bed wishing I would die in my sleep anymore. I go to bed feeling excited and accomplished. My life has become one thats filled with first time experiences. Im no longer trapped in what I cant do. I faced my fear of running on my third round of 21 Day Fix and ran my 1st 5k. I ran my 1st 10 mile race a year later, and am running my 1st half marathon this fall. Im on a mission to live limitless. These programs are giving me the fitness conditioning and mental stamina to achieve the athletic goals and dreams I have in place for myself. I fulfilled my sons promise to get on rides with him one year into my journey and never have to be excluded again. Im no longer afraid of life. I broke a lifetime of habits and my family broke habits in the process. I no longer let lifes storm wreak havoc on my circumstances, I became the storm and took control of my circumstances. I unearthed the athlete I always wished to become. I became the role model my children deserved.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  My first challenge group was for  21 Day Fix . The group helped me understand my program as I journeyed through the first round. I used the group as a place to keep myself on track, leaning on it for support during moments of temptation. There were times I began missing workouts and benefited from someone in the group calling me out because I hadnt checked in with my workouts. Seeing the consistency of others through their rounds inspired me to stay consistent and committed. I became consistent and confident enough in my program and routine that I went on to lead my own Challenge Groups as Coach. Leading Challenge Groups inspired me to become the strongest example I could be. I learned tips and tricks for faster food prep and meal planning from others in the group. I was able to get advice and support from multiple views which helped me see clearer solutions for my own situations. Challenge Groups became my safe haven to be 100% honest and 100% supported by others on the same mission.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?   From day one Krystle believed I would reach all of my goals. The times I felt like giving up, she reminded me what I was fighting for. She always knew when I needed a dose of encouragement or a dose of honesty and helped me see my habits and actions from a perspective that helped my personal growth exponentially. She always challenges me to keep striving to the next level and goal. She placed me into a team page thats purpose was to serve as an additional support community. That team support combined with hers became instrumental in my journey. When my mom was rushed off to surgery, I felt helpless again for the first time since the start of my journey. Krystle and the team were the anchor of support and encouragement I needed to get through my moms surgery and all the other adversities I faced. Support provided by her and the team became one of the reasons this time to get healthy was successful where my previous attempts had failed.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  Initially I was afraid of doing  Ultimate Reset . It ended up being one of my favorite programs. It helped me uncover the emotional connection I had with food. During the Reset I became efficient in food prep and saw the benefit in it. I discovered how certain foods provided increased energy and mental clarity. I discovered a lot of new foods I liked and some became staples post reset. Doing reset through Christmas time helped me find the joy in moments and not food. Ive been drinking  Shakeology  since February of 2015. After the first week of drinking it I noticed a significant difference in my energy levels, and reduction of cravings. 2  I quit smoking April 2015, with intentions to free up money to afford Shakeology. I ended up saving money I didnt before because affording it forced me to see how costly some of my habits were.   You can change your life, too.

Slow Cooker Banana Bread Oatmeal
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/slow-cooker-banana-bread-oatmeal,"Whoever said, Life is short. Eat dessert first, probably meant first thing in the morning. Right?  Hmm.  While birthday cake for breakfast might sound like the stuff of dreams, it certainly wont help you fit into your skinny jeans. And crashing out by 10 am because you havent had any protein or fiber is definitely more of a nightmare.   Luckily, with this Slow Cooker Banana Bread Oatmeal, breakfast can taste like dessert while still being a wholesome and nutritious way to fuel your day. Its got all of the flavor of a luscious slice of banana bread, without the oily fat (or the extra smear of butter on top). Cinnamon, nutmeg, and three whole bananas give it authentic baked-in taste. Ground flax seeds give it extra nuttiness and a boost of fiber and healthy omega-3s. And, the best part is, this recipe cooks overnight and is ready to eat when you wake up!     Its super simple to make. Just pour all of the ingredients into a slow cooker before you go to bed. In the morning, youll be able to fumble your way to the kitchen with your eyes half-closed by following the scent of freshly baked banana bread. All you need to do is spoon your serving into a bowl, top it with chopped walnuts, maple syrup, and almond milk, and your banana bread breakfast is ready to eat (or heat it up in the microwave if its been stored in the fridge).   If youre one of those people who leaps out of bed at the first twinkle of the alarm, you might consider the additional, but worthwhile, step of toasting the walnuts youll sprinkle on your Banana Bread Oatmeal. Simply heat a dry pan on the stove and toss in the walnuts. Gently shake the pan as they cook, until the nuts smell well, nutty then immediately remove them from the heat. WARNING: Do not attempt to toast walnuts if you can barely remember your own name before a cup  make that two  of coffee. Nuts can go from delightfully toasted to charcoal in the blink of a (very sleepy) eye.        Slow Cooker Banana Bread Oatmeal    Total Time: 8 hrs. 10 min.  Prep Time: 10 min.

Beachbody Results: Scott Lost 74 Pounds and Won $1,500
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-scott-lost-74-pounds-and-won-500,"Scott Henry, age 37, lost 74 lbs. with  P90 ,  P90X3 ,  The Masters Hammer and Chisel , and the  Beachbody Performance  supplements. He entered his results into the  Beachbody Challenge , and won $1,500!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I was in a job that I hated, with hours that kept me isolated from my wife and young daughters. I had to give up on multiple avenues of working dream jobs in the sports industry, and I ate and drank to fill something that was missing. During my long nights at work, I would actually make plans of how and when I was going to end my life.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  My wife began drinking  Shakeology  just after our oldest daughters third birthday, and she began to see immediate improvements. When I told her how distressed I was, she begged me to seek help. After consulting with a physician, I decided that getting my body right would be a major building block toward getting my mind right. I began working with P90, and immediately decided that Tony Horton is the guy Id like to be when I grow up.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  I struggle with a perfectionist nature, and the first several days of P90 were a struggle. I became annoyed with myself when I couldnt finish the entire session. Over time, however, those frustrations turned into goals. Tonys Do your best, forget the rest mantra became lodged in my mind, and I decided that finishing a whole session was simply the next hurdle. Then, it was finishing the whole thing without modification. Accomplishing those goals took longer than 90 days, but by acceptingmy limits, I never could have followed it up by completing P90X3 just a few months later!   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  Tonys attitude, infectious enthusiasm, and willingness to take a moment to effectively demonstrate challenging maneuvers were all key factors in my enjoyment of not only P90, but P90X3 as well. If I couldnt keep up with the platoon on a particular move, my goal would be to finish one or two more reps in their time, with the eventual goal of keeping pace rep-for-rep.   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  Im back under 200 pounds for the first time in nearly a decade and wearing a pantsizeI havent worn since high school and I graduated in 1996. I can also carry around both of my daughters at once (ages 4 and 21 months, with a combined weight of 70 pounds). Let me tell you that  70 pounds is much more fun to carry, at least until someone gets squirmy. Im seeing so much more definition in my core and my legs that my wife cant help but make comments when I walk around the house in shorts and no shirt.     How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I have a much more positive attitude in my work, with my kids, with my wife and were both in better shape to enjoy our quality time, if you know what I mean. Ive always been very temperamental, but Im so much more patient with everyone and everything. Theres a tremendous feeling of pride and confidence that comes with that achievement.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  The Challenge Groupstarted off well, until the Coach who was leading it abruptly went inactive. After that, participation dwindled to nothing, and I continued pushing through on my own.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  Rachel was always the first one to give me a like or a comment when I posted a photo or video to Instagram and Facebook, and some of her various other friends would usually follow suit. It helped to know that others were taking note of my results.   How did  a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your  transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/ regularity ?   Shakeology  was the gateway drug, so to speak. My wife and I both greatly notice improvements in our moods and energy levels when we drink our shakes regularly. Especially mood, as two young kids can sap ones patience in a hurry. Were actually quicker to get frustrated with the girls without shakes, and thats our sign that its time to pull out the blender. The  Performance line  has also been invaluable.  Energize  is essential, especially when we had to rise before 5 AM to get a workout in before taking our girls to daycare and trudging off to the day jobs. We could always tell when we ran out of  Recover , because there was much more muscle soreness from a strenuous morning.   How  did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program affect any existing health conditions you  have ?  I would experience bouts of constipation that werent what Id call frequent. But since using Shakeology daily, those episodes are nearly nonexistent.   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed! Complete any Beachbody program, and enter your results for a free gift and a chance to win cash and prizes. What program are you committing to next?

The Definition of “Healthy” Foods Is Evolving — What You Need to Know
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/the-definition-of-healthy-foods-is-evolving-what-you-need-to-know,"Picture healthy food; what comes to mind? A farmers market stand brimming with organic fruits and vegetables? Maybe the health food section of your local grocery store stocked with granola, coconut oil, and almond milk. Perhaps you recall the trendy  Washington Post  article,  No Food is Healthy. Not Even Kale. , which proposed an interesting thought: Food is not healthy, cannot be healthy, and never will be healthy.  We  are healthy; food can only be nutritious.   Semantics aside, healthy food means something different to everyone, but that shouldnt stop us from asking what it  should  mean for our individual health.     How Were Taught Which Foods Are Healthy   Most of us learn to judge a foods healthiness from the people around us. Mom, a teacher, a fit friend, and experts, like doctors and nutritionists, guide our opinions. This knowledge of food comes from a rich, but conflicting, body of science focused on nutrients. Science can help explain phenomena when we know what questions to ask and which nutrients to measure, but food is not just the sum of its nutrients. Its problematic to judge a foods healthiness simply by reading the nutrition label. Yet, we do it anyway.     Is There an Official Definition for Healthy Food?   Yes. According to the  Food and Drug Administration (FDA) , a food can only be marketed as healthy if each serving:   Contains less than the threshold amount for total fat (Contains at least 10 percent of your daily value for vitamins A, C, calcium, iron, protein, or fiber.)   By this definition, high-fat foods like almonds, avocados, and salmon would not make the cut, but Pop-Tarts would. Cue the outrage!   Last year we saw the repercussions when KIND bar, beloved by many,  got a slap on the wrist  for labeling their products as healthy. But, in May 2016,  the FDA changed its mind  and told KIND that it could return to its original labeling. Confused yet? What you have to understand is that the FDAs definition was written in the 90s during a time when we as a nation focused on low-fat foods, and wondered how the French could eat all that butter and still stay skinny!   Today, we find the above definition shaky because the science for healthy fats (e.g.  monounsaturated fats , polyunsaturated fats,  omega-3 fats , etc.) is becoming more widely accepted.   To understand why we have guidelines that ignore the benefits of nuts, we have to step back in time.     Fat: Friend or Foe?   In the 1940s, heart disease was the leading cause of death in America and scientists and doctors were hot on the trail to find ways to prevent and treat this killer. They published large, epidemiological studies  like the  Framingham Heart Study  and  Seven Country Study   following thousands of people over decades. By the 1960s, early findings suggested that  eating a high-fat diet filled with saturated fat and cholesterol  was linked to increased risk for heart disease. Respected organizations such as the American Heart Association (AHA) adopted a low-fat diet recommendation for people at risk for heart disease, but acknowledged no conclusive proof that heart attacks or strokes would be prevented by doing so.   These low-fat diets, originally intended as a way to help protect against heart disease, became  a popular path to follow for weight loss and overall health . Fear of being fat led to a fear of fat and had a huge impact on how Americans viewed their food. Butter-loving, beef-stew-slurping Americans were about to enter into three decades of the low-fat craze.   The 80s and 90s featured toned Cindy Crawford, Jane Fonda, and hours of jazzercise. We dug into Jell-O cups, munched on bagels smeared with reduced-fat cream cheese, and downed non-fat milk. After all, healthy food contained low, or better yet no, amounts of fat. (Remember, this era birthed  Olestra-fried, fat-free potato chips , whose side effects included cramps, gas, and loose bowels.)   Fast forward to the new millennium, when Americans were fretting over the Y2K bug in addition to heart disease, which kept its place as  the leading cause of death . Adding  lower-fat foods into the diet  didnt seem to help. In fact,  the rate of obesity doubled between 1980 and 2003 , by which time one third of Americans had a body mass index that classified them as obese.     Is Sugar the New Fat?   These days, the low-fat trend has quieted, and there are signs that its reversing. Many experts are leaping off the blame fat bandwagon and recommending that we eat more avocados, nuts, salmon, and even egg yolks  all sources of healthy fats. For example, when the  2015 Dietary Guidelines  were revised, the upper limit on total fat consumption was absent. In its  scientific report  on the 2015 Dietary Guidelines, the Office of Disease Prevention and Health Promotion noted, reducing total fat (replacing total fat with overall carbohydrates) does not lower CVD (cardiovascular disease) risk.   Today,  heart disease is  still  the leading killer , about  70 percent of Americans are overweight  or obese, and  type 2 diabetes is on the rise . In order to make low-fat and nonfat products taste good, many food companies replaced fat with sugar.   Highly-processed carbohydrates (e.g. sweetened cereals, cookies, white bread) and sugary beverages are the new focus. The AHAs current standing recommendation is to  limit added sugar  to no more than 6 teaspoons for women and 9 teaspoons for men. The  World Health Organization  suggests lower is better, if possible.   To give you some real-world context: A 12-ounce can of cola contains about 37 grams or 9.25 teaspoons of added sugar  more than what a typical male should have in one day by the AHAs recommendations.   Even more shocking: A  2009 study  published in the  Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics  found that of 85,451 consumer packaged foods purchased in the US, 74 percent contained added sugar.     The Takeaway   This year, the FDA announced it would  revise the definition of healthy  on  food labeling  to keep up with evolving nutrition science; this is good news for everyone. The definition for what we consider healthy is still evolving, and its easy and exciting to get swept up in the latest changes in nutrition science.   But, I would argue that its equally (if not more) important to focus on what hasnt. Eating a minimally processed, mostly plant-based diet centered on fruits, vegetables, and whole grains is time-tested advice not even grandma will argue with. Instead of boiling it down to nutrients, judge your food as a whole."

What Happens to Your Body When You Overeat?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/what-happens-to-your-body-when-you-overeat,"Eating more than your body needs over and over again is the best strategy for weight gain. Rocket science? Of course not. Most Americans have figured out how to tip the scales with  70 percent now falling into the overweight or obese  categories. But what happens inside your body when you overeat?   Lets suppose its FriYAY. And we all know that that means. its time to let loose and relax! For some that means spending the night out on the town, raising glasses then swinging by the drive-thru to satisfy the munchies. Others may stay in and curl up with their love to watch a movie, order takeout, and share a pint of ice cream. In either scenario, all too often, relaxation = overindulging in food.   If you spend many of your weekends this way, you could be binging more than you realize. Add in those extra slices of pizza on Tuesday, two (or six) cookies at that office birthday celebration, and mindless snacking in front of the TV on Thursday, and youre eating more than you need on the regs.   How the Body Reacts to Too Much Food      The moment that you set your eyes on or smell food, your digestive system begins working and preparing to eat by releasing the enzymes and hormones that break down food. During the digestion process, food moves from the mouth to the esophagus to the stomach to the small intestine to the large intestine. The pancreas and liver contribute digestive juices to help with the breakdown and absorption of nutrients. The National Institutes of Health breaks the process down further  in this article .   When you overeat, here are a few of the things that can happen to your body:     The stomach swells.  When you eat too much, the stomach expands like a balloon to accommodate the large amount of food, which then pushes against the other organs in your body and makes you feel like you need to loosen your pants.   You start feeling bloated and gassy.  Every time you swallow food, air gets into the digestive track, and that gas expands in the stomach, making it feel bloated. This sensation is exacerbated if you consume carbonated beverages with your meal. Burping is a common side effect of eating too much food, because the build up of gas needs to be released somehow.   Heartburn starts to set in.  The stomach produces hydrochloric acid to break down food, and, if you overeat, this may lead to a back up into the esophagus, resulting in heartburn (the more food you eat, the more acids needed to break down the food). You may be more prone to heartburn if youre over consuming foods that take longer to digest like greasy cheeseburgers and beer.   Excess calories are stored.  As food moves through your digestive tract and into the small intestine, where nutrients are absorbed, the liver and the pancreas begin to secrete enzymes to digest fats, carbs, and proteins. Cells in the intestinal walls absorb these macronutrients, along with vitamins and minerals, to be used for energy or storage. Excess calories that cannot be used for energy are stored as fat.   Organs work overtime.  Digesting a massive meal requires the organs to work in overdrive, secreting extra hormones and enzymes to break down the food. When this happens on the regular, issues can start to happen with metabolism and endocrine function, like  insulin resistance, increased cortisol, and reduction in growth hormone .   You may feel drowsy and tired.  As the pancreas releases the hormone insulin, it sends off a cascade of hormones to be released. Serotonin and melatonin, the feel good hormones, are released. This may make you feel tired and content.   You feel nauseated.  Leptin, a hormone that is produced by the fat cells, tells the brain that youre no longer hungry and need to stop eating. If you eat too fast, you may miss this signal and continue eating past the feeling of fullness, causing the body to produce more leptin. People that have more fat cells in their bodies may develop  leptin resistance , making it even harder to recognize fullness, and, ultimately, lose weight."

Everything You Need to Know About Rosé Wine
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/everything-you-need-to-know-about-rose-wine,"Move over white wine. Ros wine has taken its place as my new go-to (in moderation, of course) on hot summer days. And speaking of hot, ros has taken the food world by storm.   Check out Instagram, food blogs, and pretty much any lifestyle website and everythings coming up ross: ros slushies, ros ice cubes, ros gummy bears, ros popsicles  you get the picture. You can make an endless number of treats with this gorgeous wine. But first, a lesson in ros then stay tuned for four unique recipes that use the pink potion.        What Is Ros Wine?   Ros wines are made from the same grapes as reds, but ross can range in color from super-pigmented magenta to golden copper. The color depends on two things: the type of grapes that were used and how long the skins were soaked in the juice.   Some grapes have a thicker skin, and this is what imparts a richer color. For ros wines, the skins are left in the juice for about 1224 hours. For red wines, the skins can sit with the juice for up to three weeks, whereas for white wines, the skin spends no time in contact with the juice.   Provence is Frances oldest wine-making region, and was also the first region in the world to make ros. According to  Vins de Provence , in the early days of winemaking, all red wines were pale, closer in color to ros wines. This is because the winemaking technique of macerating  leaving the grape juice in contact with the skins before pressing  had not yet been developed.   With only a few exceptions, all juice from grapes, despite the color of the skin, is clear. (Teinturier grapes, which have red flesh, are the only ones that produce red juice.) In those early days, the grapes were pressed and the color-extracting skins were removed relatively quickly, leaving what weve adopted today as ros.   Chef David Rotter, the culinary mind behind New York Citys Boulton & Watt and Forest Point restaurants, recommends pairing ros with crudo or ceviche, because the bright quality of the wine pairs well with fish. But Rotter doesnt recommend cooking with ros. The flavor tends to burn off while cooking because [ross] do not have enough body, in comparison with reds and whites, he says.        Ros Isnt Just for Drinking Anymore   Though drinking ros is certainly the most common way to enjoy the wine, there are many other ways to enjoy it. Two of the hottest ros trends are frozen ros (also called fros) and ros-infused gummy bears.   James Beard nominee Chef Sam Mason, the owner/chef of OddFellows Ice Cream Co. in New York, agrees. He loves to cook with ros, but by cooking he means with a glass of ros in hand, rather than [in] the sauce pan.   Mason does, however, blend up the most scrumptious ros popsicles youll ever taste. The pops are easy to make: dry, non-sparkling ros, a little water and some sugar, and locust bean gum (a natural thickener). Mason serves them upside down in a cup filled with sparkling ros to further expand the flavor and texture.      How to Shop for Ros Wine   Some of the most delicious ros wines are at the wallet-friendly $1015 price point. Ros is a wine of pleasure, meant to be enjoyed on a hot summer day, not a grand emotional experience, says award-winning sommelier Michael Madrigale, formerly of Chef Daniel Bouluds Bar Boulud. When choosing a bottle, Madrigale suggests going by the color: Ros bottles are usually clear, so you can see the color, which is usually a pretty good indicator of the style.   Do you like a super crisp, dry, and bright wine? Then look for one thats pale pink, preferably from Provence, the birthplace of ros. In fact, the village of Tavel in Provence makes only ros wine, and is known worldwide for making some of the best.   Do you prefer fruitier wines with a rounder mouth feel? Try a ros from California, where grapes bask in the sun, and grow bigger and juicier than their European cousins. These wines range in color because there are so many varieties of grapes used in California wine-making, but these ross tend to be a medium pink color.   If you like your wine spicy and fruity, go for an Italian rosato or a Spanish rosado. These tend to be a darker pink.   Want to try your hand at a few rose recipes? Here are four that feature the drink as a primary ingredient.      Ros Slushie (Fros)   Total Time:  7 hrs. 35 min.   Prep Time:  15 min.   Cooking Time:  5 min.

Add ice cubes to a glass of ros to keep it extra cold, or to your favorite cocktail for a flavor boost."

P90 Results: Air Force Vet Loses 50 Pounds, Wins $1,000!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/p90-results-air-force-vet-loses-50-pounds-wins-1000,"Jeff Pritchett, age 50, lost 38 lbs in 5.5 months with  P90  and  Shakeology . He entered his results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  After I retired from the United States Air Force in 2008, I didnt have anyone telling me what to do in the area of fitness, and I let my body decline. My weight shot up to 230 pounds. My physical activity involved getting out of bed and sitting at my computer all day, or watching TV. I felt tired all the time, and struggled with back and knee pain. I felt hopeless for any chance of reversing my condition. I knew what I  should  do, but felt there was no way I could ever be able to start, maintain, or complete any weight-loss or exercise program. In fact, I felt my days were seriously numbered, and it made me sick to think of my 3-year-old daughter growing up without a daddy.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  It took more than just a single thing to inspire me to change my life. First, it was the reality No,  the probability,  that I might never see my daughters 18th birthday if I continued down the path I was on. Second was my own 50th birthday rapidly approaching. The thought of being in the same physical and mental state when I turned 50, absolutely terrified me! With a little more than 30 days until I hit the big  five-o , my wife and I jumped in with both feet! We found an accountability group, adopted a healthy eating plan, and made the life commitment to be healthy and fit as a team!   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  The greatest challenges I think everyone faces are finding motivation, having accountability, getting instruction, carving out time, and maintaining consistency. My greatest challenge was a combination of all of these. This is where Beachbody came to my rescue! Reading other peoples success stories not only motivated me, but also inspired me to believe and have hope again. I found the accountability I needed in my Coachs Challenge Group. Having  Beachbody-On-Demand  gave me access to the Beachbody trainers where I could choose a workout program that best suited my current fitness needs. Most of the workouts were around 30-minutes, so time was no longer an issue. Even with all of these tools, the consistency part was still up to my wife and me. But even that wasnt difficult since we used Shakeology as a delicious after-workout reward. I can honestly say, Beachbody has given me a new lease on life, and my family is eternally grateful.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I liked a lot of things about Tony Hortons P90 program. I immediately felt safe trusting him with my fitness evolution. He encouraged me to hang with the modifier and make use of the pause button. This actually helped me be more in control of my progress instead of feeling guilty or discouraged for not keeping up. Another thing I liked was the variety of the movements and the instruction on the proper form. I could easily commit to the exercises when I knew I was doing them correctly. I never got bored with the variety.   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  The P90 program got me off my keg, kept me engaged, helped me lose nearly 40 pounds, and gave me the six-pack I only previously dreamed of. Im most proud of being able to wear size 32 jeans again (instead of my 36s). It had been about 30 years since Ive been able to wear 32s.     How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  My confidence and stamina have greatly increased since completing my Beachbody program. I now have confidence that my health and fitness goals are both realistic and forthcoming. My hope is restored. My stamina is incredible now that Im not carrying around the equivalent weight of a 32-count flat of water (37 pounds). I have the energy I need to help my wife in the kitchen or make repairs on our home. My daughter has a daddy who can get down to her level and play. The only thing lacking is more hours in the day.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  Our Challenge Group totally kept me inspired and motivated to stay the course. My Coach Tara kept things real and I fell in love with people on the team experiencing many of the same challenges I was facing. For now, we laugh together, cry together, and share our struggles to further motivate and inspire the team towards success. Were all human and sometimes need to be part of something bigger to stay encouraged. I dont think I could have completed the program without my coach and team.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  Coach Tara gave me plenty of advice and ideas before and during my fitness program. Today, she listens and identifies with many of my challenges. I trust her integrity and feel comfortable asking her for help. When she doesnt have the answer, she investigates and finds them out on my behalf. If I could place her on a pedestal, she would go directly under my wife for inspiration and motivation. She definitely embodies the Beachbody image.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  Shakeology was a reward for completing our daily workout and still is to this day. I cannot imagine starting my day without this delicious superfood shake, that my body craves. I believe its instrumental in controlling my sweet cravings and it keeps me regular. I can concentrate better and have a ton of energy. Still the greatest fitness benefit gained was Shakeology keeping me on track to never miss a workout. To me, consistency is everything!   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?  After completing P90, my lower back no longer hurts. I seem to walk taller and slouch less.   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed! Complete any Beachbody program, and enter your results for a free gift and a chance to win cash and prizes.      Results vary depending on starting point, goals, and effort."

Seven Great New Traditions to Start This 4th
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/seven-great-new-traditions-to-start-this-4th,"This year, its time to try some new traditions for Independence Day! Here are seven that could make your 4th of July even more fun.   All You Can Eat  Every year, Nathans on Coney Island hosts a hot dog eating contest. We dont recommend partaking in this, but what about a watermelon eating one? Line up willing participants at a picnic table with plates of watermelon quarters, tell them to keep their hands behind their backs, and set a timer for two minutes! Even your vegan friends can get involved. Winner takes home a prize of your choice! One of which will not be indigestion.   Flag Fashion Show  Themed pet parties never cease to entertain. If your home is pet friendly, encourage your friends to bring their dogs  dressed up in patriotic costumes!   Clam Boil  All you need is a four-gallon pot with a fitted strainer (or 3 gallon without a strainer). Add a few pounds of clams, chicken sausage (minimally-processed, nitrite free), fresh corn, potatoes, onions, and Old Bay. Youll have steaming cup of tradition to pass around in 20 minutes. Throw veggies in the pot of 5 quarts of water and 3 cups of clam juice for ten minutes, then add clean clams, sausage and shrimp for another 8 minutes. Voila! A tradition of the North East birthplace of our constitutional rights is ready to be consumed.   Recession Friendly Ring Toss  Got athletic friends? Gather 10  blow up rings  and set up an old broomstick in the yard. Every time someone misses, they must perform five burpees, 10 push-ups, or 20 bicycles to get back in the game. Tossing the rings from small groups will give everyone a chance to cheer and sweat. Once a few winners have been chosen, they can go head-to-head.   Note:  This can also be done with official ring toss gear, Mr. Fancy Pants.   Community Round Robin  Invite your neighbors to join you in a little community scavenger hunt. Create prizes and clues ahead of time that will lead the teams from one yard to the next and  if you live in a city  to different neighborhood hot spots. Winner gets an Uncle Sam hat!   Vogue Like Lady Liberty  What do foam fingers, colonial mustaches, flags, bandanas, and top hats have in common? Predictablity? No! Theyre props for your home photobooth! For $55,  Spark Booth  is totally hands-free and self-sufficient. Set it up, walk away, and encourage your friends to get silly!   Fireworks!  Theres the sparkly ones, the star spangled ones, and then the big loud finale. Dont forget about the screaming children and barely enough space to take a deep breath. This year, take a break from the madness and host a projection movie in your backyard. This year coincides with the 40th Anniversary of  Jaws , so you dont even have to make a decision between Will Smith and Tom Cruise to honor the Independence Day theme.   What are your favorite 4th of July traditions?"

FOCUS T25 Results: Gary Lost 43.4 Pounds and Won $1,000!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/focus-t25-results-gary-lost-43-4-pounds-and-won-1000,"Gary Rhodes, age 31, lost 43.4 lbs in five months with  FOCUS T25  and the  Beachbody Performance  supplements. He entered his results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I have had success with Beachbody in the past. I lost over 80 lbs with two rounds of  INSANITY . I then took a maintenance approach and was able to keep the weight off. Then, last year, with the economic downturn, I began to stress a lot. As others lost their jobs, my workload increased, taking up more and more of my time. Even still, the fear of losing my job lingered over my head. With all of this stress weighing on me, I pushed my fitness to the back burner. I began to eat whatever was convenient, not caring about the quality or quantity. By the end of the year I had gained nearly all of the weight back. I started dieting, and lost some weight initially, but I soon hit a plateau. I knew I needed to do more.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  One day, when I was looking through some old photos, I stumbled upon my before and after photos from INSANITY. The before photo looked way too familiar. I went to the mirror and took a good look at myself. I looked at the before photo and back to the mirror. There was little to no difference. How could I have let myself go this far? I had never felt more ashamed. I decided to put my before and after photos as the background on my phone. I reminder of what I was. What I could be. What I  would  be. With even less time available with my current work schedule, I wasnt sure that I would be able to find enough time for a program like INSANITY. Then I saw the FOCUS T25 DVDs. Surely, I could find 25 minutes. And so, my rebirth began   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  I had gotten so ashamed of myself that I began avoiding my friends. These were good friends. We had relied on each other for motivation and accountability. Now, I would go out of my way to make sure they didnt see me. That they didnt see how far I had let myself go. Luckily Beachbody had thought of this. With the SuperGym and Challenge Groups on TeamBeachbody.com, I was able to find the motivation and accountability that I needed, all from home. Now, after regaining some confidence through my results with FOCUS T25, I have reconnected with some of my old friends. I now have the best of both worlds.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  Focus T25. 25 minutes per day. It takes away excuses. You can find/make 25 minutes in your day. The best part about it, though, is once you get started, its no longer a workout that you need to do. You start looking forward to it. It truly is one of the best parts of my day. I get up in the morning, push play, and Im ready for the day. It energizes me. Not only that, but when you push play first thing in the morning, you have already accomplished a major goal for the day. You get to start off by crossing off one of the biggest items on your checklist for the day! It doesnt get much better than that.  Beachbody On Demand  is great, as well. Being able to stream my workouts anywhere, helped me to stay on track and never miss a workout! Its simple and easy to use, which is great when you are pressed on time. I have now finished the Pure Gamma Calendar, and will be doing the Pure Strength Hybrid next! I cant wait to see what happens!     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I have lost 43lbs and 10 in off my waist with Focus T25, but thats not what Im most proud of with this program. I have so much more energy, now, and my kids can see it. They are being inspired by my journey. They are even joining me for some workouts! They follow Tania with modified movements and take water breaks (I dont encourage them to follow Shaun Ts craziness, lol). Being able to inspire others is amazing. I couldnt be more proud of anything in my journey.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I stand taller, now. I smile more. I move more. I can play with my children without getting winded halfway through a game. Overall, I just feel so much better. Sure, losing the weight and inches is great, but being able to look in the mirror and smile instead of just looking away in shame is incredible. T25 gave me that. T25 gave me back the life I had before the stress of work took hold of me.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  Accountability is sometimes the unsung hero of fitness. Many people have the perfect program, the perfect equipment, the perfect location, but they fail. Having someone to help you stay on track, can make that difference. The Challenge Group I joined solved this problem. When I have someone waiting for me to check in to let them know how my workout was that day, it gives me motivation. I wont just be letting myself down. Ill be letting them down. Seeing others check in helped to inspire me as well. If they can push play, so can I. Plus, its a lot more fun when you get to brag to others about killing a workout, that just telling yourself!   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  Daniel gives you as much attention as you need. If I ever had a question, he was quick to answer it. No matter the question. He didnt hover, though. He let me do my thing, but I always knew he was there if I needed him. If I decide to take the next step into coaching, I know that he will help me to succeed in that endeavor, as well.   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

BBQ Chicken Flatbread Pizza
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/bbq-chicken-flatbread-pizza,"Lets talk about pizza for a moment.   Theres New York-style, where toppings are served up on a super thin crust that you can bend and eat as you people watch your way down the street. Theres Chicagos deep dish with slices so dense and rich that its hard to eat more than one (trust me I tried during my most recent trip there). And finally, theres SoCal pizza, made with a flatbread base and topped with all sorts of exotic toppingslike stinging nettles. And kale.   And thats just scratching the surface  it would take a much longer article, nay, a tome  to categorize and classify all the different types of pizzas in this world. Unfortunately, most of them do not fall under the classification of healthy. This includes the best pizza Ive probably ever had: A basil, tomatoes, and mozzarella cheese pizza I singlehandedly devoured in Naples with a knife and fork. And, now I want to go to there. It is, after all, the birthplace of pizza.   But, like you, I am trying to eat healthy. Enter the BBQ Chicken Flatbread Pizza! First off, this flatbread pizza screams summer. Its loaded with barbecue sauce and chicken. Second, unless you tell someone, theres no way theyre going to know its healthy. Half of a good-sized BBQ chicken flatbread will set you back about 300 calories and will power you with 35 grams of protein so you can dominate your opponents in horseshoes. Or whatever the kids are playing these days.     Because heres the thing. You could order a Dominos Memphis BBQ Chicken Pizza. And itll probably be tasty.  But its 200 calories a slice . So, in theory, its lower in calories. But, if there is a whole pizza in front of me, there is no way Im eating just one slice.   Which brings us back to the BBQ Chicken Flatbread Pizza. Its loaded with grilled chicken and onions and corn and other veggies that make summer awesome. What are you waiting for?       Psstif youre gluten free  use this  cauliflower crust !   BBQ Chicken Flatbread Pizza   Total Time:  23 min.   Prep Time:  15 min.   Cooking Time:  8 min.   Yield:  4 servings,  flatbread each   Ingredients:  2 whole wheat flatbreads (or 6-inch whole wheat pitas)   cup barbecue sauce, reduced-sugar  1 cups shredded cooked chicken breast   cup canned black beans, drained, rinsed   cup corn kernels   medium red onion, chopped   cup shredded cheddar cheese   cup finely chopped fresh cilantro  1 Tbsp. fresh lime juice   Preparation  1.

The 10 Most Contaminated Foods
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/the-10-most-contaminated-foods,"Youve listened to the hype about organic foods. But if youre like 45 percent of Americans polled in a recent Gallup survey, youre still unsure whether theyre worth the extra money or not. After all, your parents ate non-organic foods for most of their lives  probably still do  and they turned out all right. Plus, there are federal and state agencies whose primary purpose is to inspect food and determine if its safe for human consumption. So if they give it their stamp of approval, it must be safe, right? Perhaps. But heres the thing: While many government agencies and academic institutions have tested individual foods for safety, few have looked closely at the bigger picture, taking into account the cumulative and synergistic effects of all of the pesticides and other toxic chemicals we ingest each day.   And thats what were really concerned about  daily exposure to complex mixtures of pesticides, says Sonya Lunder, M.P.H., a senior researcher at the non-profit Environmental Working Group who analyzes pesticides on foods. Some are linked to cancers and others are linked to birth defects in children.   So whats a person to do? Start by reducing your consumption of the following 10 foods, which typically have higher concentrations of toxins than most other foods in the supermarket. Its almost impossible to eliminate all contaminants from your life, but if you reduce your consumptionofthe foods below  and heed our advice regarding what to eat insteadyoull reduce your exposure significantly.      CONVENTIONAL HOT CHILI PEPPERS  Chili peppers are often laced with toxic pesticides that are banned on other foods, according to the Environmental Working Group. One such chemical, chlorpyrifos, can cause nausea, dizziness, and even death in high enough doses. The Environmental Protection Agency told us they are currently evaluating the science on whether to ban its use, and expect to make a decision by the end of 2016, but its still legal (and well worth avoiding) at the time of this writing.   Your move:  Buy organic whole peppers, especially if you plan on eating them raw. Some pesticides are broken down when heated, but you wont get rid of everything, says Lunder, who also advises eating organic hot sauces and salsas.      TILEFISH, SWORDFISH, TUNA, AND SHARK  These five fish had the highest concentrations of mercury (a potent neurotoxin) out of all of the seafood studied in a recent  report  by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Mercury is an airborne industrial pollutant that leaches into water, where it is absorbed by aquatic life. It also becomes concentrated as you move up the food chain. A large tuna will typically have a concentration of mercury approximately a million times greater than the waters it inhabits, says Paul Drevnick, Ph.D., a research scientist at the University of Michigan who studies mercury contamination.   Your move:  Limit canned white or albacore tuna to no more than three times a month. Canned skipjack tuna (which is used on most canned light tuna and typically has three times less mercury than albacore) can be eaten as frequently as once or more a week, according to the Environmental Defense Fund. Your best canned fish option is wild-caught pink or sockeye salmon, which is typically low in contaminants and high in omega-3s (more on salmon in a bit). The EDF also advises that you eat tilefish and swordfish no more than once a month, and shark even less often (assuming youre not also eating any of the above fish too, since the effects add up). Smaller fish and shellfish all tend to be low in mercury because theyre lower down the food chain, and are safer to eat. That includes scallops, oysters, shrimp, clams, and tilapia, which contained the lowest levels of mercury, according to the FDA.      FARM-RAISED SALMON  Although FDA studies have found farm-raised salmon to be low in mercury, its high in another pollutant called polychlorinated biphenyl (PCB). A 2004  study  in the journal  Science  found that the PCB levels in farm-raised salmon are as much as eight times higher than in wild-caught salmon. Thats a problem because PCBs can wreak havoc your immune and endocrine systems. They have also been linked to cancer and heart attacks, and have been banned in manufacturing since 1979. Theres still a fair amount of residual PCBs left over in the environment, however, and those compounds continue to absorb into the fatty tissue of fish like salmon. Indeed, the same delicious, fatty meat that makes salmon a potent source of omega-3s can also make them a potent source of PCBs.   Your move:   Physicians for Social Responsibility, a non-profit organization of medical professionals, recommends eating fresh or frozen wild Pacific salmon no more than twice a month, and farmed Atlantic salmon just once every two months. Canned salmon is considered safer: You can eat that twice a week. If youre worried about the impact of eating less seafood on your ability to get omega-3s, consider taking a fish oil supplement, which have consistently been shown to contain fewer PCBs than a serving of fish. Fish oil supplements are molecularly distilled to remove impurities, and theyre typically made from smaller fish like sardines and anchovies that dont have a lot of PCBs to begin with, says Tom Cooperman, M.D., president of ConsumerLabs.org, an organization that conducts regular tests of commercial fish oil products.      CONVENTIONALLY GROWN SPINACH AND KALE  These leafy greens are nutritional powerhouses, but a  report  by the California Department of Pesticide Regulation  the biggest U.S. grower of both vegetables  found illegal pesticides on 10 percent of spinach and 4 percent of kale tested. But heres the scariest part: Only 104 of Californias 390 spinach and kale farms were included in the study. So while contaminated vegetables are destroyed or thoroughly cleaned when theyre found, there very well might me much more contaminated spinach and kale making their way to store shelves.   Your move:  Buying organic reduces the chances youll inadvertently be exposed to pesticides in your salad or green smoothie, but not entirely: Even a few  organic brands tested positive for illegal pesticides , including Capay Organic and Del Monte. Its always smart to give your greens a thorough wash before eating them.      CONVENTIONALLY GROWN STRAWBERRIES AND GRAPES  Farmers douse conventional strawberries and grapes with a heavy cocktail of pesticides because their skins are so thin. Strawberries grow right on the ground and they have no protective outer layer, so theyre vulnerable to anything that lives down there, says Lunder. According to the USDA Pesticide Data Program, that potent mix includes 45 pesticides on strawberries (including a known carcinogen called captan found on 43 percent of samples), and 56 different pesticides on grapes.   Your move:  Buy organic strawberries and grapes, and dont forget about organic wines. Not only are they healthier (studies show that fungicides often end up in finished bottles), but theyre also a more socially responsible, as pesticides have recently been blamed for health problems in wine country workers in France.      CONVENTIONALLY GROWN APPLES  Apples are popular year-round, but theyre primarily harvested between August and September. As a result, off-season apples likely spend a lot of time  possibly months  in cold storage before you see them in the produce aisle. Theyre treated chemically to prevent mold and fungus during the long time theyre in storage, says Lunder. And it should come as no surprise that many of those chemicals can have less than desirable effects on the human body.   Your move:   A  study  in the journal  Food Chemistry  found that rinsing conventionally grown apples reduced pesticide residue by 50 percent, and peeling them reduced it by a whopping 98 percent. Unfortunately, peeling also removes about half of the fiber content (from 5.4 g down to 2.8 g in a 3-inch apple), so your best bet is still (you guessed it) to buy organic. If that doesnt work with your grocery budget, rinse conventionally grown apples under cold water for at least 60 seconds while gently rubbing the skin with your fingertips, advises the National Pesticide Information Center. You wont get rid of all of the pesticides, but its better than giving them a quick polish on your shirt.      RICE  It doesnt matter whether you eat organic or conventional rice  either way, theres a good chance it contains arsenic, a poisonous element that raises the risk of certain cancers, and can cause kidney and liver damage. In 2013, the FDA released a  report  revealing that you dont even need to eat straight rice to consume worrying levels of arsenic  a single serving of a product containing rice (e.g., beer or gluten-free brownie mix) can contain up to 7.2 micrograms of the stuff. To put that in perspective, safe drinking water can only have 1/16 that amount (about 10 parts per billion of arsenic). Why doesnt it matter if you buy organic (at least as far as arsenic is concerned)? Because rice absorbs it from groundwater, and hangs on to 10 times as much of it as other grains.   Your move:   Still buy organic. Youll skip the pesticides, and if you cook it in three times more water than the directions suggest  discarding the extra like you do with pasta once its fully cooked  youll reduce your arsenic exposure by as much as 60 percent, according to a recent FDA  study .      CONVENTIONALLY GROWN PEACHES AND NECTARINES  These stone fruits are nearly identical (a single gene determines the difference), so theyre both vulnerable to the same pests and diseases, and are grown with similar pesticide regimens. A peachs distinguishing fuzzy surface, however, means more pesticides cling to the skin before you bite down. Indeed, U.S. Department of Agriculture tests found that the fuzzy fruit contained as much as 62 different pesticides, while nectarines had 33. Even more alarming: A full 98 percent of conventionally grown peaches and 97 percent of nectarines had at least one pesticide on them, according to an analysis by the Environmental Working Group. By comparison, 88 percent of conventionally grown mangoes (another popular stone fruit) were found to be pesticide free by the time they hit store shelves.   Your move:  Buy mangos. You get extra points for buying organic, but given the low incidence of pesticides in conventional samples, and the fact that theyre generally eaten pealed, mangoes are one fruit thats relatively safe to eat regardless of how theyre grown.      GROUND TURKEY  No less than 60 percent of samples in a 2013  study  by  Consumer Reports  contained antibiotic-resistant strains of potentially harmful bacteria like  E. coli  in 60 percent of samples. And in a 2011 FDA report, a full 81 percent of ground turkey samples tested positive for  Enterococci  (a sign of fecal contamination). Since conventionally raised turkeys (along with chickens, pigs, and cows, for that matter) can be given antibiotics without a prescription, some of the gut bacteria in these animals develop drug resistance before theyre slaughtered. That resistance, if youre unlucky enough to catch a bug from tainted meat, can turn what would normally be an unpleasant but treatable bacterial infection into something potentially lethal. Researchers estimate that around 23,000 people die each year from antibiotic resistant infections, but its not clear how many of those bacteria originate in livestock.   Your move:  Any harmful bacteria will be killed if you cook the turkey to the recommended internal temperature of 165 degrees Fahrenheit, but you might not be completely out of the woods. Antibiotic resistant genes may still be present, and potentially acquired by other bacteria, including those in our gut, says Monica Ponder, PhD, a professor of food science at Virginia Tech. Buying organic meat that was raised without antibiotics will cut down on drug-resistant bacteria, but some studies have found that you can still get them from vegetables fertilized with manure from animals that were treated with antibiotics. Ponder is currently researching better farming practices to prevent this from happening, but as of right now, buying organic is still your best option.      MOST FOODS THAT COME IN A CAN  A few years ago, consumers started to worry about a compound called bisphenol-A (BPA), which is found in many plastic water bottles, food storage containers, and linings of steel and aluminum cans. The chemical seeps into food (particularly when the cans are heated during the sealing process), and once you consume it, BPA can mimic estrogen and mess with testosterone and other hormones. It was also linked to an increased risk of heart disease in a 2014 Korean  study , which found that drinking two cans of BPA-tainted soy milk resulted in an acute increase in blood pressure.   Your move:  Many bottle manufacturers have stopped using plastics with BPA, but 90 percent of the canned food supply is still lined with BPA-based epoxies, says Lunder.  Click here  for a list of BPA-free brands, or check out the product lines at Whole Foods and Trader Joes, both of which have largely eliminated BPA packaging from their shelves."

Just Call Your Mom Already
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/just-call-your-mom-already,"For people lucky enough to have a mom to give a Mothers Day gift to, the honor of celebrating that mom can be daunting. What present can you give the woman who birthed or adopted you that appropriately repays her all that shes done for you? How do you say thanks to that? Annually?   (For all of you not in the know, Mothers Day rolls around this year on May 8th. Thats this Sunday, so theres no time to waste.)   In an unofficial, possibly fictional poll of moms nationwide, mothers overwhelmingly voted for a subscription to a monthly wine club.   But forget all that. Seriously, your mom really just wants to know youre thinking of her. Every day. Fortunately, some of you are, at least according to the 2012  Clark University Poll of Emerging Adults  by authors Jeffrey Jensen Arnett, Ph.D., and Joseph Schwab. The poll suggested that 55 percent of respondents between the ages of 18 and 29 stay in contact with their parents daily or nearly every day via text, email, phone, or in person. Another  study  from 2014 found that parents relationships with their children improved with the more means of communication they utilized, including instant messaging, video calls, social networking, and even parent-baffling applications like Snapchat.   So maybe youve got that going for you heading into Mothers Day this year, which Im calling Mothers Day 2016: The Showdown. The Letdown. The Help-Me-Down-Im-Stuck-on-This-Ladder.   The Showdown:  Because this day has become an annual tournament between you and your siblings  and sometimes Dad  to out-gift everyone else.   The Letdown:  Because your sister inevitably wins said tournament  that overachieving brat.   The Ladder:  Because sometimes you get stuck up there. Sometimes your laptop has to be droned up to you so you can finish writing a thing due Monday. Just saying. (Send food.)      What Should You Get Your Mom?  Call her. Let me repeat that in case you missed it the first time.  Call her . If you also want to send her a gift and a card, do so. (If you want to get her something last minute, might we recommend  Beachbody On Demand  where she can stream hundreds of workouts?) Shell appreciate those as well. But what she really wants is for you to let her know youre thinking of her and that you hope shes having a fantastic existence despite your ongoing shenanigans.   Just be careful what you say. Because, you know, sometimes when your mouth opens, it says things that ought not to be said. Hold your tongue  literally if you have to.      What Not to Say When You Call Your Mom   Any variation on the send money theme, such as I wouldve sent a gift, but I cant even cover my rent or For Mothers Day, Id like to give you the opportunity to pay my phone bill or Im  soooo  hungry.    Anything about your sex life  ever. TMI for the mom. She may say she wants to know, but unless shes Dr. Ruth Westheimer, shes lying  or shell use the information against you at a later date.    Hows Dad? Not the time. As you try to sign off of the call, she may summon some feigned shock and ask, Dont you want to know how your father is? To which, you get to reply, I called for  you , Mom  and watch those mom-points rack up. Dad wont care. He knows the score.    If your parents are divorced, she may try the whole, Have you spoken to your father recently? Do  not  take the bait. Reply with a moratorium on talk of all things Dad: Lets not discuss him today  its  your  day. She cant argue with that. If she tries to force the issue, one stern Mom should end that portion of the conversation.    Similarly, politics is also off-limits.   If your Mothers Day call in any way becomes tense or heated, redirect to gossiping about your siblings or  her  siblings. Mom will eat up your empathy with a spoon and will be delighted you took the time to reach out.   Just call your mom already. Wish her a happy Mothers Day. And mean it. You can thank us later."

Ultimate Reset Results: Lauren Lost 12 Pounds in 21 Days!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/ultimate-reset-results-lauren-lost-12-pounds-in-21-days,"Lauren McHugh, age 24, lost 12 lbs in 21 days with  Ultimate Reset  and  Shakeology . She entered her results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,000!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  Ive done so many Beachbody programs and I have had amazing experiences with them all. However, Ive always been lacking in one areanutrition. I can workout as hard as I want to, but if Im not fueling my body right, I am undoing all my hard work. Ive been a vegetarian for over a decade, but Ive basically just eaten carbs. Ive been at a plateau with my nutrition for basically ever, and I was at a point where enough is enough and I needed this reset to completely change my lifestyle.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  What inspired me to begin this specific transformation journey was that I have always struggled with my nutrition and binging, mostly on white carbs, cheese, and alcohol. I always overeat. Ive been watching so many nutrition documentaries the past few months, and Ive become 90% vegan. Ive been a vegan before but I was reluctant to try new foods. This was a huge wake-up call when I got this program in December and did not even start it until April. It was due to being at my wits end with my nutrition and not being able to look in the mirror because I was working so hard and not progressing. Ive never been where I want to be with my health, and this was my final test of willpower to really see if its possible.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  The greatest challenge I faced was eating healthy consistently. I always workout but I always put my diet on the back burner. This is why I specifically chose this programyoure not really supposed to workout and the entire focus is on nutrition and getting healthy, making this a lifestyle change and completely redefining the way you think about foods and nutrition. The Ultimate Reset did this. Due to the strict meal plan, new foods and recipes, and my willpower throughout these three weeks, Ive come away with an entirely different mindset about nutrition and what I put in my body. It absolutely is a  reset , and not just a quick fix. Ive done the 3-Day Refresh several times, but this was really the kick-start I needed to look at nutrition differently and fuel my body with the foods it actually cravedwhole organic foods full of the phytonutrients I need to stay healthy as a vegan, not sugary carbs!    What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I liked that the entire programs focus was on nutrition, and that it came with ways to go the extra mile, which I definitely utilized. I like that there were Facebook groups available with the grocery lists, substitutions, water intake, tips, and advice along the way! I loved the way I felt every single day. I prepared for this challenge by taking dairy out of my diet so I think it was a bit easier for me, but I saw my relationships improve significantly, my energy increase, my productivity increase, I had more mental clarity, I felt super confident with my body for the first time, I was noticing a new take on my health and nutrition and it was rubbing off on those around me, and I had less stress! My lack of motivation, binge eating, stress-eating, cravings, drinking, my old habits, and my bad self-esteem basically disappeared!     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I am so incredibly proud of my results. I lost 12 pounds from simple vegan nutrition alone! I did this entire cleanse as a vegan, and I also lost 12.7 inches!! This includes measuring the largest part of my stomach area. My skin is clearer, teeth whiter, my hair doesnt get as oily, Ive tried new vegetables, I feel lighter, and Im not bloated for once!   For the first time in my life, I followed a program 100% perfectly. I never cheatednot even once. I never slipped up because I knew this was a life changer for me. Every time I stepped into Whole Foods, I was actually excited to try new produce, and to make this my consistent healthy lifestyle    How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I look at everything differently! Right after I finished this program, it was my birthday. Instead of overeating and binging on tons of sugar, I stuck to my vegan lifestyle, ate in moderation, knew when I was full (for once), and educated my family about my new lifestyle. Ive always preached about being a vegetarian, but I definitely wasnt a healthy one! Now I feel like I can talk about a whole foods, organic vegan lifestyle with confidence, because Ive stuck with this, followed it perfectly, and made it a part of my day to day life. I will be using many of these recipes from the Ultimate Reset, will be juicing daily, and I cant wait to see how much more I can change solely due to the completion of this amazing program.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  I coached myself through the program. I did a lot of research prior to starting and found nothing on doing this as a vegan, nor any support. Therefore, I decided to take initiative and blog about my journey. I have 21 days of videos, all the recipes on my Pinterest, a daily blog evaluating every single day of the reset, so that anyone going through this journey does not have to go through it alone. I offer daily tips, advice, recipes, etc on my blog so other people can have the support I did not. Honestly I think it was a good thing for me because it was a very personal journey. I had to have the willpower alone, the dedication to get through it on my own, and in the end I think my tips and daily check ins will help a lot of people    How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  I was so happy I could have my chocolate vegan Shakeology for a snack everyday! I looked forward to this daily because its my favorite, its delicious, it gave me a much needed energy boost, and Im used to drinking it daily! I was on the Ultimate Reset the whole time, so I already listed all the benefits. At first, I couldnt sleep and I had a hard time with that, but I could tell my digestion was getting back on track from eating so many veggies. My mood went up and down because this is a major cleanse, but my mental clarity was amazing! I also gained so much confidence throughout this journey, and became a much stronger individual overall.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?  My digestive issues significantly improved. Ive been drinking Shakeology daily for over a year and Ive seen my health improve. Shakeology has saved my nutrition, and offered me a healthy alternative to quick unhealthy foods. I do not crave bad food nearly as much!   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

5 Tips to Stop Falling Off the Weight-Loss Wagon
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/5-tips-to-stop-falling-off-the-weight-loss-wagon,"Im sure many of you have experienced this at some point in your weight-loss journey:   Youve just found the magic solution to losing the extra weight and keeping it off forever. You figure out what to eat on the plan outlined, buy the groceries needed to adhere to it, and adopt the exercise regime it recommends. You follow the program strictly for two weeks, and guess what? You lose some weight, you feel better, and you like how your clothes fit. Success!   Then ___________ happens.   There was birthday cake at the office. Your partner left you. Your boss reprimanded you. You went out to lunch with your coworkers.   Before you know it, youve had a snack-cident. It crept up on you without your conscious knowledge and drove your head into a bag of potato chips.   After your snack-cident, then comes the wall of shame that sends you into a pit of despair and self-loathing. You ask yourself: Why did I do that? Now Ive really blown it!   Feeling like a failure, you ditch your diet and fall back into your old patterns. The weight you lost soon comes back, along with a little extra.   Why does this keep happening? Below are 3 of the common pitfalls that set up unrealistic expectations and can lead you to fall off the healthy weight loss wagon. Ive also included 5 tips on how to develop an approach that will stop you from engaging in that unhealthy cycle you know all too well and that will help you ultimately reach your goals.   Pitfall #1: New beginnings  Human beings enjoy things that are new and exciting. It may sound strange, but sometimes its fun to start a new diet or exercise routine. You get to try new recipes and new workout routines and theres all these gadgets that track all your metrics. But, once the initial excitement wears off, we tend to get bored.   Pitfall #2: Short and sweet  We also tend to have short attention spans and want immediate results that dont require a lot of suffering on our part. Suffering doesnt have to be physical painthough the soreness you might feel when starting a workout routine could count  it can also be the annoyance of not ordering your usual unhealthy coffee beverage or avoiding the fries or preparing healthy meals ahead of time instead of vegging out on the couch.   Pitfall #3: Unrealistic expectations  If it were possible to lose a huge amount of weight in a short amount of time and keep it off for the rest of our lives, none of us would be in this situation in the first place. Sustained, healthy weight loss and maintenance takes time, endurance, and patience.      Here are 5 tips to avoid those pitfalls and set yourself up for success:   1. Focus on the Big Picture  Acknowledge the desire for novelty and meet these needs in other areas in your life before the newness of the diet and/or exercise routine wears off. For example, you could try a new sport or hobby. Also, look at the rest of your life and what realistic, sustainable changes or allowances you need to make to meet your goals. Include special occasions like birthdays, meals out, and vacations into your overall plan.      2. Become a Mental Endurance Athlete  Think of weight loss and maintenance as a marathon rather than a sprint. If you reflect on your struggle with weight, youll probably discover that it took you years to get to where you are today. Similarly, it may take years to find success in your weight loss journey and to stay there in the long run.      3. Be Realistic About Human Nature  Accept your weaknesses. For example, if you know that an upcoming family gathering will be stressful and it will be hard to stick to your food plan, work around it by planning ahead. Consider what you will eat ahead of time and figure out a way to de-stress afterwards that doesnt revolve around food.   Remember that being healthy is hard work and doesnt come easily and you may not always enjoy the process. Expect tough times when you are bored of your meal plan and feel like rebelling or resent having to work out because you just dont feel like it that day.      4. Celebrate Your Successes  We tend to flourish and succeed at goals when we are praised. Instead of giving yourself a label like failure, when you go off-plan, tell yourself its okay and accept that youre a work in progress. Stay away from extreme labels that make you feel hopeless (failure is one of them), or set unachievable standards (like looking like a supermodel).      5. Develop a Strong Support System  Many people find that they are more successful with long-term weight loss when they involve others in the process. Announce your commitment to get healthier and stronger to your friends, family, and coworkers. Start or join a Challenge Group, join a Facebook group, or recruit workout buddies and accountability partners to help you stay motivated when your resolve starts to slip or you feel tempted to make unhealthy choices.   Also, consider investing in counseling. There is a tendency to slip back into old eating patterns after an initial weight loss due to how we deal (or dont deal) with our emotions. A therapist can help you pinpoint patterns when faced with upsetting emotions and help you address problems when they arise instead of stuffing them down with food."

Transformation Tuesday: Greg Lost 15 Pounds with The Master’s Hammer and Chisel!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-greg-lost-15-pounds-with-the-masters-hammer-and-chisel,"Greg was disappointed in himself for gaining back the weight he had previously lost. He wanted to become healthier, toned, and sculpted with the approach of his 53rd birthday. He decided to try The Masters Hammer and Chisel and got great results! He lost 15 pounds in 60 days and got absolutely shredded. Read his story in his own words below:   One day, I caught myself. I was slumped half lying, half sitting on my couch and there it was  my very own round bulb of blubber. It was my stomach I was looking at. As the lump grew in my throat, I struggled up from the couch and went to look at myself in the bathroom mirror. It finally hit me  Ive got to change somehow.   It had been just over a year since I had done any kind of weight training. I did PiYo in September 2015, and I had clearly gained quite a few pounds by taking a couple months off. To break addictions and bad habits, there must be a complete reset. I wanted to be happy with my body again.   The greatest challenge Ifaced before beginning the program was believing that a home fitness program would actually work  let alone something that I found on an infomercial! Plus, 30-minute workouts? Youve got to be kidding. However, I was looking forward to the combination of sculpting and toning in the program . I wassuper determined to work hard, and it paid off.   My weight loss was not significant, but the fat-to-muscle conversion was dramatic. I can now comfortably perform pull-ups and chin-ups. I continued to increase my lifting weight over the course of the program too, but without bulking up. Not knowing what to expect before this program before I began, I was not disappointed. I have never been this sculpted from a program before.   The dual workouts were so fun! I even laughed out loud a couple times. I also liked the alternating nature of the workouts, with both the Hammer and the Chisel. I get bored easily, so I can get into a funk without variety. I loved every second of this program.   I have shown my transformation images to my challenge teammates, and the response from them has been overwhelming. Ive always been a pretty private person, but a t my age and with these kinds of results  I really have nothing to hide, now!     You can change your life, too.

Beachbody Results: John Lost 176 Pounds and Won $6,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/beachbody-results-john-lost-100-pounds,"John Mattes, age 40, lost 176 lbs. with a variety of  Beachbody  Fitness Programs,  Shakeology , and the  Beachbody Performance  supplements. He entered his results into the  Beachbody Challenge , and won $6,500!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  To be completely honest, my life was totally miserable. In an eight month time frame from November of 2014 to June of 2015, after my birthday, I almost died twice from complications from blood clots. The first time they literally said if I had come in five minutes later I would have been dead. The second time I was not presenting as strong symptoms but I felt off and went. It ended up being just as bad as the first time in November. I was sad,only going out of my house to do customer appointments. After appointments I would lay on my couch all day and eat roughly 10,000 to 12,000 calories a day of junk. I had no off switch and I was essentially killing myself. I really did not feel worthy of anyones love and was just going through the motions everyday with no plan and could not see a future. I was deathly afraid of taking pictures because I thought I looked disgusting.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I was, for the first time, really confronted with my mortality and how long my time on the earth would play out. The second time with blood clots was scarier because the symptoms were not as evident as the first time and I thought next time I am just going to fall over and die like my dad did when I was 17. My doctors were aggressively trying to get me to do gastric bypass. When I was on a cruise with my mom she was even saying I should do gastric bypass because I could not do it by myself. Even all my sisters piled on. At first, I was extremely sad and then there was something in me telling me to show them all. After my cruise I started drinking old bags of Shakeology I had laying around and just reducing calories to a somewhat normal level until I got clearance. Then I saw  Casey Walkers  Yahoo article and I reached out for help. He said he believed in me and the rest was history. Here it was, a complete stranger having faith in me when none of my doctors or family would.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  My biggest challenge was I was newly released from workout restriction so I was constantly worried about how my leg would hold up because of the massive amount of weight I was carrying*. At my heaviest I was 410 pounds plus in June and on day officially starting workout plus eating on 8/3/15 I was 366 pounds. I actually started my first week of  21 Day Fix  on a work trip in Las Vegas. It was living hell. Not only were there temptations at every corner, I was completely disgusted with how outof shape I was doing workouts. I was literally in tears every day for the first few weeks. The Challenge Group was run by my Coach Casey Walker, and Casey himself kept me on track. He told me just move, dont skip a workout, and take your Shakeology everyday. I would have quit if it wasnt for the group. When I finished my first 21 days and lost 21 pounds and 16 inches I was floored because I felt I was doing terrible. That moment just lit the fire and gave me confidence to keep going.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I chose  22 Minute Hard Corps  because I was committed to several travel dates and I felt it would be hard to give the full attention and have access to weights to do  Hammer and Chisel  properly. I had already tried on demand on preview. I liked that the program was very challenging for the 22 minutes. I was able to modify difficulty and add tweaks to add in more complexity. So I would add more weight or I would do straight through with no breaks. The ab workouts, especially Spec Ops Core, is some of the hardest Beachbody has offered. It was a great follow on for the work I did with  INSANITY MAX:30 .   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?   So here are cumulative stats for my four programs (most recently INSANITY MAX:30) and my month of using Shakeology when I was on restriction. 410 pounds to 234 pounds, to total  176 pounds lost!  75+ inches! Bodyfat % from 51% to 19%! My A1C improved! Triglycerides improved! I was also excited to have my abs come in more, but the coolest thing to do was to tear myself out of my comfort zone and do a Tough Mudder on May 6th with a group of guys including my accountability partner Doug. I was able to do the whole 11+ mile course attacking it the whole time. I was even able to run down some youngsters. It was awesome to see how relevant the exercises I did in MAX:30 and 22 Minute Hard Corps translated to the course. My cardiovascular fitness is through the roof now.     How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I am a new person! My posture is different, my attitude is different, my relationships are stronger, and my earning potential at work as increased significantly. I have also been given a platform to help others which has been a true blessing. The last couple of weeks have been surreal as I have been doing a lot of partner events with peers and sales people I had not seen in over 10 months, at least 10 people came by and asked if John still worked at Gigamon and didnt even realize it was me. The others used words of profanity to describe their excitement. Most assumed I had done Gastric Bypass and when I told them diet and exercise they were stunned. Also during 22HC I got certified as an  INSANITY  instructor hoping to teach classes at local gyms. I am even scheduled for Country Heat certification at Summit which will be perfect as I complete Hammer and Chisel.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  The Challenge Group was huge! We were all strangers but the support and positivity bonded all of us very quickly. Any moment I had a minute of self doubt about being able to do the program or if I wanted to skip a workout, peoples posts about doing their workouts kept me in check. We shared all the time, and it made doing the program very enjoyable. The Challenge Group also broke me out of my lone wolf mentality and allowed me to open up, share, and rely on others for support. I have formed a very special bound with one of my Challenge Group members, Doug. He is now my success partner working with me on combined challenge groups with over 40 people in them! We talk with each other everyday and I know if I even think about straying he is a call away. I participate in our Challenge Groups we run like it is my first Challenge Group to keep me honest and to model the appropriate behaviors to people new to their own journey   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  I think almost every other day I tell Casey Walker thank you for saving my life! That moment he said he believed in me changed me forever. He was always there for me and he was pushing me every day making sure I stay grounded in my journey. He even helped me regain my faith in God where I was recently baptized in January. I was even able to help him most recently when his Auto-Immune disease flared up again. I was there almost every day he was in hospital and it brought us even closer together. He thanks me, but I still tell him this is the least I can do; I was dead without him. He is just so genuine and so real, and he has a huge heart. I was also able to thank Casey and take him as my plus one to my Italy Top Sellers Club trip. It was awesome to let him do something he had never done before. We still talk or chat every day to push each other.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  As mentioned previously  Shakeology  was so huge in curbing sugar and coffee cravings  . It is well worth its price! It was a lynchpin in my eating strategy I dont know what I would do without it. I have been using  Beachbody Performance  the whole time after 21 Day Fix, and I cannot say enough about the quality. All I can say is they flat out work, and I dont know how I would have been able to attack the programs with a consistent intensity without them. I had not been using Creatine but am now using it at the start of Hammer and Chisel as I am more focused on shaping my body now thatI am less then 20 pounds away from mygoal weight.

In Memory: Steve Edwards
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/ask-the-expert-beachbody-programs/in-memory-steve-edwards,"Beachbody Vice President of Fitness and Nutrition Steve Edwards died the morning of February 25 th  after a long battle against an especially aggressive form of mantle cell lymphoma. He went after it with everything he had, fighting courageously to his final moments. I know this because I had the honor of being with him to the end. Steve may have been my boss for 13 years, but more importantly, he was one of my best friends.   Beachbody President Jon Congdon (also Steves longtime friend) and CEO Carl Daikeler hired Steve in the early 2000s to help legitimize their budding fitness companyand legitimize it he did. Few people understand, live, breathe, and eat fitness the way Steve did. Whether he was writing  the definitive rock climbing guide  to Santa Barbara and Ventura counties, competing in  a mountain bike race  across the Himalayas, executing one of his awesomely impossible  birthday challenges , or playing a pivotal role in the creation of P90X and countless other Beachbody programs, Steve was undeniably The Man when it came to fitness.   I was the first member of Steves teama group that would eventually become the Beachbody Fitness and Nutrition Experts, or FNE. Were the ones who answer your fitness and nutrition questions, either on the  message boards , on this  blog , or over social media. (Always one for a good, longwinded answer, Steve struggled with Twitter. You cant solve peoples problems in 143 characters! hed protest.) Behind the scenes, its also our job to make sure the programs you buy actually work and the content you read is actually accurate.   Much like the goofy old ensemble war movies he loved so much, Steve picked a pack of oddballsall with our own unique skillsand let us work the way we needed to work, as long as the job got done. We became the  Kellys Heroes  or  Dirty Dozen  of the company. I dont know if this was Steves orchestrated vision  per se.  As his right hand man, I would often discuss strategy with him, but hed usually give me just enough intel to keep me inspired and busy. Hed leave meand everyone elseout of the loop on key points on how he planned to deliver on the challenges our job presented. In retrospect, I think thats because he was Captain Kirk-ing his way through the situation, betting on knowledge and guts to bluff his way to success. Its not chess, Mister Spock, hed say in his best William Shatner impersonation when Id press him for strategy. Poker! Do you know the game?   He would also remind FNE regularly to keep our egos in check and focus on the work. Theres well over a century worth of combined knowledge in the department and with that comes some fairly strong views. Thats just, like, your opinion, man, he would remind us, quoting one of his favorite movies,  The Big Lebowski . And he was right. When we let go of our pride, embraced the fact that fitness and nutrition knowledge doesnt equate to marketing acumen, and played nicely with the other departments, good things always happened. Products were always better. As Steve would say, Were just here to help and thats it.   In all the years we worked together, he only saw fit to chastise me once (although I deserved it many more times). One beautiful autumn morning a couple years ago, I played hooky to go kayaking in Redondo Beach, where a pod of blue whales was feeding. In so doing, I blew off an important meeting with several C-something-Os. When I got home, Steve called. So you missed that meeting and Im supposed to let you know thats not okay. What happened? When I told him about my aquatic adventure, he exploded. You kayaked with blue whales?!? Thats rad!!! Okay, look, dont worry about it, but, you know, dont do that again, okay?   And I never did. Because thats how Steve worked. He inspired you to do better by your own rules. Hed just as soon help a 300-pound man walk around the block as he would coach a pro cyclist on how to crush his next race. He was the only person Ive ever known who approached everyone around him completely free of judgment. (Except every now and then, which was okay because there was nothing funnier than the rare, consternated Steve Edwards.)   This Monday, Jon and Carl posthumously awarded Steve the Beachbody Founders Award. As they presented it, Carl told the story of an exchange he had with Steve a couple months ago. They were discussing Beachbody on Demand (BOD) and all the things they could do with it. Carl was considering the epic scope of the project and the role of FNE. As BOD grows, theres going to be more and more demand for expertise and advice. Because the more people engage in these programs, the more questions it raises. Carl pondered, how were they going to address that?   There was a beat. Then Steve said in that laidback tone he maintained under even the worst conditions, This is what weve done since day one, man. We got this. No other company could do what were about to do. We got this.   No one could ever fill the shoes of Steve Edwards. Theres a hole there now, but were going to do our best to  continue with style . Rest easy, my friend. You fought the good fight and now its our turn. We got this, Steve. We got this."

What Happened When I Gave Up Sugar For Three Weeks (And How You Can Too)
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/sugar-detox,"For as long as I can remember, Ive been a sugar junkie. I probably got this trait from my dad, who can make half a pan of brownies disappear in a day. I can devour a pack of sour candies in 30 minutes flat, or pop 10 Hersheys Kisses into my mouth without batting an eye. I love healthy and nutritious foods and eat a salad almost every day for lunch, but my self-control is non-existent when it comes to baked goods, candy, and ice cream.   Unfortunately, a tendency to over-indulge in sugar can lead to  health issues , so at the beginning of the new year, I decided to really embrace a healthy lifestyle and ditch sugar for a week. Hey, anyone can go a week without sugar, right? But Beachbodys Senior Director of Nutrition Content, Denis Faye, immediately (and, I should point out, enthusiastically) increased my sugar timeout to three weeks. I regretted ever mentioning the idea. Regardless, I let him explain how to rid a life of the joys of sugar and I drafted a set of rules to follow over the course of those three weeks.   Heres how I, a hopeless sugar addict, gave up added sugar  and how you can do it, too.      The Rules  No added sugar, no artificial sweeteners, and no alcohol.     First, I had to figure out what in my diet had to go. For three weeks I wouldnt add honey to my overnight oats, I would make my own salad dressing instead of buying it from the store, and I would drink plain black coffee for an afternoon pick-me-up instead of a handful of chocolate chips. I swapped out my vanilla almond milk for the unsweetened version, and I chose plain Greek yogurt instead of a flavored kind. My options to satisfy my sweet tooth began and ended with fruit.  What joy , muttered my inner chocoholic.   In addition to added sugar, artificial sweeteners also went on the no-eat list. You dont absorb artificial sweeteners the same as natural sugar, and they dont have any calories, but theyre weird chemicals and they put your palate off. explained Faye.   Many experts dont count Stevia as an artificial sweetener given it comes from a natural source. Thats sound logic, Faye added, but if youre trying to reboot your taste buds, you might as well skip it too. I was interested to see if my sweet tooth would change by not eating added or artificial sugar, so I opted to remove all forms of sweetener for this experiment.   And finally, alcohol. A moderate amount of red wine is permitted in  The Sugar Detox   plan, thanks to the fact it contains the antioxidant  resveratrol . But it does contain a lot of sugar and it lowers your inhibitions, which meant it would make it that much harder for me to resist a sugary snack. It looked like Id have to find another way to consume my grapes.     Of course, just because I was giving up added sugar for a few weeks didnt mean I had to walk away from it forever. Sugar can be useful at times, particularly if youre an endurance athlete trying to manage glycogen, Faye said. Also, it can be an ingredient in perfectly healthy recipes. The key is moderation. Since moderation is clearly what I lack when it comes to sugar, I decided it was best to start from zero  which is exactly what I set out to do.      The Experience  The first week was incredible. The second week I wanted to quit. And, the third week I questioned everything about life.   After reading  The Sugar Detox  and the  10-Day Detox Diet , I decided to go cold turkey starting January 1. Unfortunately, I just had baked 40 cupcakes for an eight-person New Years Eve party. So, on Day 1 of my three weeks without sugar, I was surrounded with about two dozen cupcakes. Not a great way to start. Since January 1 was a Friday, I adjusted my plan begin on Monday. Because all good diets start at the beginning of the week, right?     Some people claim to gain a heap of energy when they wean themselves off sugar. I was  not  one of those people. I did experience a more even energy level, void of extreme highs and subsequent crashes, which is the normal rollercoaster I ride when I eat all the sugar I please. This made me feel great during the first week, but after the honeymoon phase, my cravings took over my brain. This was partially due to the fact that I was extremely tired, and it was difficult to fight off my desire for cookies and also the temptation to fall asleep at my desk. I had to make a conscious effort to choose plain black coffee instead of a pack of peach rings. It was harder to plan out all my meals, but I did it anyway. Otherwise, Id be scrambling to find something without a sugary sauce from the food trucks lurking outside.   Despite my exhausted willpower, I survived the second week, and, surprisingly, entered the homestretch of this treacherous experiment with a new kind of motivation. I had yet to give up, and I had proven to myself that I could actually do this thing! Although my sweet tooth still wouldnt grant me a reprieve in the final week, I had tamed it. Overnight oats sweetened only by blueberries tasted like a treat. Water infused with watermelon sustained me through a rough afternoon. Was I really turning into one of  those  people who found fulfillment in eating natures candy? I felt good about eating clean food, I was happy with how my body looked, and I was thrilled that I wasnt experiencing post-candy crashes. Huh.      The Physical Changes  Simply by removing sugar from my diet, I lost three pounds in three weeks. That might not sound remarkable, but my weight has been extremely consistent for the past five years, and I was astonished to see different numbers on the scale. I also had  visible abs  for three weeks. Three weeks without sugar meant three weeks of a flat, defined stomach. Dare I say I loved that more than a cookie?   One physical effect I was anticipating was a change in my complexion. I had been warned that my face might break out when it was freed from the confines of sugar (the whole, it has to get worse before it gets better deal). Thankfully, that didnt happen. Instead, my skin actually got less oily.        The Aftermath  The first weekend after the sugar ban was lifted, I ate everything. Fries smothered in ketchup, greasy Chinese takeout, waffles, mimosas, and more. I loved ituntil I experienced a mountainous sugar crash and my face broke out. Within 36 hours of eating sugar again, my face had gone from clear and clean to oily, breakout central.   As I was assessing my complexion, I had an epiphany.  What if I could enjoy sweets in moderation?  A novel idea, right? As much as I missed eating whatever I pleased, I hated the bloated, groggy feeling that came with over-indulging in sugary foods, not to mention the giant zit that decided to call my chin home. I also realized that I really didnt enjoy eating  every  kind of sweet. I didnt care for cheap chocolate or the processed store-bought cookies anymore. My taste buds really had become more discerning.   After three weeks without sugar, I had lost weight, gained energy, and refined my palate. I also spent significantly less money on food and drinks. I guess thats what happens when you pass on wine and chocolate-covered candies. Am I going to continue on this sugar-free crusade? Absolutely not. But I am going to continue some of the habits I created. I like my homemade salad dressings, I now prefer a cup of black coffee in the afternoon to chocolate, and fruit for dessert doesnt sound as blasphemous as it once did. I dont think I could permanently say goodbye to my beloved chocolate cupcakes, but Ive gained a much better understanding of moderation and quality.        Want to try to giving up sugar? Here are my tips, inspired by what I learned through the experience.      Purge your kitchen, home, and workspace of sugar before you begin.  I learned this the hard way with those cupcakes. But over that weekend, I got rid of anything that could (and would) tempt me during my three sugar-free weeks. This proved to be the  most  important act of defense. If it wasnt there, I wasnt going to eat it.      Get a support system, and dont be afraid to ask for help.  Its a lot harder to cheat on your diet when your friends throw you shade when you reach for something sweet. A good support system can strengthen your willpower when you feel it dwindling. Even if you think your friends wont take your commitment seriously, give them a chance before writing them off. By the end of my three weeks, my friends, family, and coworkers were genuinely interested in how I was doing with my no-sugar diet. (Yes, even my brownie-loving dad.) They wanted to know what foods I was and was not eating, and what physical and mental changes I was experiencing. It became an educational experience for everyone.        Set a time frame.  Knowing I only had to hold out on eating sugar for three weeks made the task attainable and gave me a definitive finish line.      Learn what sugar is.  This seems obvious, but sugar hides under a lot of names. My first trip to the grocery store was twice as long as usual because I looked at every single label, and looked up every single ingredient I didnt know. This thing called dextrose in my favorite hummus? Sugar. The rice thats used to make sushi? It has sugar in it. Knowing what to look for, and knowing what products tend to have sugar in them can save a lot of time and confusion.     It was also challenging to eat out, since I couldnt look at an ingredient list for every menu item. Did the hamburger buns have sugar in them? Maybe. What  exactly  is in that special sauce? No idea. Instead of becoming a hermit for three weeks, I maintained a normal social schedule and challenged myself to find sugar-free items on the menu. My go-to option became a burger or chicken sandwich, minus the bun, and a salad. As for the dressing situation, I asked for balsamic vinaigrette on the side. Most balsamic vinaigrettes dont have sugar, but I used it sparingly to make the damage as minimal as possible in case it did.      Prep yourself for success.  Make sure you always have sugar-free foods on the ready. One weekend, my friends and I went skiing and they brought chips and Pop-Tarts for the trip. I was hungry and irritable for the whole drive because there wasnt anything I could eat. Had I brought my own snacks, it would have been a non-issue.     Getting enough sleep is also really important. When my energy was drained, so was my willpower. It was exhausting to fight off my cravings when I was also fighting to stay awake. And thats when I needed to      Know how to cheat.  If I were perfect, I would have gone three weeks without added sugar, artificial sweetener, or alcohol. Shockingly, I am not. I had a few bites of dark chocolate one night and a few glasses of wine another evening. I also indulged in Shakeology a few times, even though it does have some stevia in it. But I chose my cheats carefully. I ate dark chocolate because it was allowed in week three of  The Sugar Detox , and  studies  have shown that dark chocolate can be good for your health. My chocolate craving was satisfied much faster than usual, so I really didnt eat that much of it. Shakeology tasted amazing, as per usual, but I noticed that it was pretty sweet compared to the other foods I was eating. As for the wine, I did feel quite giddy after just one glass. This indulgence didnt dramatically change the course of my no-sugar diet, but it definitely could have. No matter how much you drink, alcohol impairs your judgment. And when youre already craving that chocolate chip cookie, a glass wine might convince you that its okay to eat one. Or two. And a scoop of ice cream.      Finally, fruit is your best friend.  Really .  As a devoted sugar consumer, I laughed when people told me that fruit was satisfying dessert. One year my family gave me a birthday cake with fruit and a cool whip topping instead of a heap of buttercream and I thought it was a joke. I was thankful for the effort and graciously enjoyed it, but I  absolutely  followed it up with a chocolate bar. So when I had to substitute my desserts for fruit, I thought it would be the end of mebut I was wrong. When fruit is the only sweet thing you eat, it tastes  really  sweet. I couldnt believe it. But watermelon and fresh berries became my candy during those three weeks, and I would gladly make them my after-dinner meal again."

Is It Really a Big Deal If We Don’t Know Where Our Meat Comes From?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/is-it-really-a-big-deal-if-we-dont-know-where-our-meat-comes-from,"By Laura Tedesco   For weeks, the Internet has been abuzz over the removal of a food label that nobody  except maybe die-hard locavores  really cared about until it was gone: the little sticker that told you where the cow or pig thats now your dinner was born, raised, and slaughtered.   Of course, if put on the spot, most of us will declare, perhaps in an act of misplaced patriotism, that we want  no, demand!  U.S.-certified meat. In a 2011 University of Kentucky study, for example, U.S. consumers rated domestic beef as the safest and beef of an unknown origin as the riskiest. Another oft-cited study, published in the  Journal of Agricultural and Resource Economics , found that shoppers were willing to pay 38 percent more for U.S.-certified steak and 58 percent more for U.S.-certified burgers.   But these studies represent only a theoretical shopping trip. How does country-of-origin labeling affect our thinking when were mulling over meat in the supermarketnot being interviewed by a white-coated scientist? Research reveals that, in reality, we may not give the Made in America stamp much thought.   Heres proof: The same University of Kentucky study found that only about a third of U.S. consumers consider the origin of their beef a serious concern. And in a 2014 Texas Tech University study, just 1 percent of U.S. beef eaters said country-of-origin is a critical factor when choosing their steaks, rating the type of steak, the appearance of the meat, the price, and the grade of beef as more important than where it came from.   Together, these findings suggest that, if asked, most of us will fight for the right to know where our meat was raised  but in truth, we probably didnt pay that much attention to the country-of-origin labels we now claim to so desperately miss.   And as adamant as we may be that all things American are best, our tastebuds cant really distinguish between a steak from the States and one from the land of Justin Bieber: In the same Texas Tech study, beef eaters thought U.S. and Canadian steaks were equally palatable. That may be because the beef production system in Canada is strikingly similar to that of U.S. producers, despite the medias recent insistence that unlabeled, imported meat is something to be feared, says Kenneth Burdine, Ph.D., an assistant extension professor of livestock marketing at the University of Kentucky.   Canada has a predominantly grain-based system, just like the U.S., leading to the well-marbled, tender beef most of us want, Burdine says. And if youre a fan of grass-fed meat, often touted for its higher levels of omega-3 fatty acids, you may actually  prefer  imported meat, since countries like Australia and Uruguay often rely on grass more than grain, making their meat leaner.   Still opposed to the idea of meat from abroad? Keep in mind that only eight to 20 percent of our meat is imported  and its not coming primarily from China. According to USDA data, in 2015, the bulk of imported beef and veal was purchased from Australia, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand. Most of our imported pork came from Canada, and imported lamb from Australia.   Much of the beef we import is relegated to ground beef, since the cattle raised in outside countries are often grass-fed, unlike the grain-fed  and fatter  cattle raised stateside. As a result, the ground beef you buy in the supermarket is probably a melting pot of meat: some of the fatty stuff from the States, combined with leaner beef from, say, Australia or New Zealand. Under the now-defunct country-of-origin labeling (COOL) regulations, all of the countries of origin had to be listed on the label  but with a notable loophole: If a processor stopped using ground meat from a particular country, it had 60 days to remove that country from the label, meaning the country-of-origin label may not have been entirely accurate for up to two months, according to University of Idaho experts. So much for total transparency.   Another reason why COOL may not be all its cracked up to be: The law never applied to the most concerning meat products on store shelves  hot dogs, sausage, lunch meats, meatloaf, pre-cooked products, or products in which meat is one ingredient among many (e.g. spaghetti sauce, pizza). In other words, under COOL, the mystery meats of the supermarket were allowed to remain, well, a mystery.   This doesnt discount the fact that country-of-origin labels can help inform the consumers who choose to use them  and that removing these labels means shoppers have access to one less piece of information about their meat. So, yes, from this perspective, the repeal of COOL is a step backward for consumers.   But, the truth is, says Keith Belk, Ph.D., a professor of meat safety and quality at Colorado State University, COOL was never about the people buying meat  it was about the people selling it. At the time, the U.S. was importing lots of really lean cattle, because we didnt have enough cattle to make ground beef with, says Belk, who testified before Congress when COOL was originally proposed. So [cattle producers] would see all these cattle coming across the [U.S.-Canadian] border. They felt the government should do more to protect the prices of their products, instead of bringing product across the border from Canada. So initially, [country-of-origin labeling] was a protectionism effort.   Senators from the border states where these cattlemen lived lobbied to add country-of-origin labeling requirements to the 2002 Farm Bill  and they succeeded, which meant that producers of whole muscle cuts and ground beef, chicken, goat, and pork, as well as various non-meat foods, including fresh produce, had to let consumers know where they came from. Congress delayed COOLs implementation twice, but in 2009, the law finally went into effect.   In 2013, an additional layer was added: Instead of saying,Product of the U.S., for example, producers had to specify Born, Raised, and Slaughtered in the U.S. or Born in Canada, Raised and Slaughtered in the U.S. This change was an attempt to appease the World Trade Organization (WTO), which had already begun cracking down on country-of-origin labeling, since it was found to violate international trade agreements.   If all of this sounds like a move toward greater transparency, think again: The producers that pushed for country-of-origin labeling opposed traceability  that is, the use of barcoded ear tags, retinal scanning, or DNA tracking to follow livestock from birth to slaughter, making it easy to prove whether or not the animal was truly of 100 percent U.S. origin. They didnt want to put themselves in the position of proving that their cattle came from where they said they came from, explains Belk. The result was an honor system of sorts: Under COOL legislation, producers legally only had to sign an affidavit promising their cattle were raised where they advertised. Not all producers are honestmost of them are, but there are some that arent, Belk says.   When the U.S. appealed the WTO ruling, the organization stuck by its decision, permitting Mexico and Canadatwo of the countries most significantly affected by COOL  to instate retaliatory trade sanctions against the United States, totaling more than $1 billion. This is what ultimately prompted Congress to repeal the labeling law for beef and pork in December.   But before you claim conspiracy  the government wants to feed us filthy meat!  consider this: The USDA has consistently explained that country-of-origin labeling is a marketing program, not a food-safety measure. It means almost nothing for food safety, contends Edward Mills, Ph.D., an associate professor of meat science at Penn State University. It just makes a difference on what labels are on the boxes and packages. Burdine echoes this sentiment: Country-of-origin does not impact the inspection or food safety standards at allwhether the label is there or not, the same food safety standards apply.   Read: Regardless of where the meat is from  whether California or Australia or Uruguaythe product is held to the same rigorous rules, or what the USDA calls equivalency requirements.  This means that processing facilities around the world must use the same, or equivalent, safety measures as those implemented in the U.S., says Belk, who has visited a number of plants around the worldand concluded that [imported meat] is at least as safe as the meat youd buy here.   In fact, the concern over the origins of meat may simply be due to a lack of understanding of how our food inspection system works. In recent years, with the spate of cases of contaminated produce, theres understandable anxiety about imported fruits and vegetables. But produce is under the jurisdiction of the FDA, while meat is presided over by the USDA  a distinction that matters. The USDA has over 3,000 inspectors for under 3,000 plants, says Mills, whereas FDA has a few hundred inspectors for something like 5,000 plants. As Belk explains, USDA has inspectors in every plant that produces beef that is sold in the United States. FDA has only enough inspectors to look at processing operations once every three years.   Bottom line: Country-of-origin labels provided a piece of information  and any information is valuable when it comes to the food we eat. But the labels are not the end-all-be-all for selecting safe, high-quality food. So what should you rely on instead?   Look for the USDA stamp of approval  It should be a given that your meat has been inspected by the USDA  but occasionally, a shipment slips through the cracks, as was recently the case with chicken and beef from a California producer, prompting a recall of the uninspected meat. So scan the package for a stamp that says the USDA inspected  and passed  the meat. The USDA inspection stamp on meat products is a really, really important indicator of safety, says Mills. That tells you that the animal was healthy at slaughter, that it was slaughtered and processed in a sanitary environment, that the appropriate temperatures have been maintained.   Be aware that you may occasionally encounter chicken without a USDA stamp  and that doesnt mean it was unintentionally passed over. Small poultry producers are legally exempted from inspection, says Mills, so you wont see the USDA icon on their packaging. In these cases, consider asking the producer to show you third-party certificationfor example, from the Global Food Safety Initiativeso you know that certain safety standards are being upheld.   Shop local  with caution  If you want to know where your meat was slaughtered, you may be tempted to turn to farmers markets for your steaks. But look past the charming chalkboard signs, and you may make an unwelcome discovery. You can find locally raised beef being sold that came out of a Tyson box, says Belk. He suggests visiting the actual farm to make your purchase  that way, you can see exactly how the livestock are being raised, and increase your odds of getting exactly what you think youre buying. Even then, you should ask to see third-party verification and check for the USDA stamp of approval, advises Belk.   Visually inspect your beef  Mills trains chefs to look for two basic signs of high-quality  and therefore, tasty  beef: marbling and minimal amounts of external fat. You want to see the flecks of fat on the inside of the muscle  the marbling part  because thats where the flavor and desirability comes from, he says. From a health perspective, that fat is a very small component of the total composition of the product. The appearance of your steak may also be a clue as to where it came from  if your meat has little to no marbling, it may be from outside our borders. When cattle are grass-fed, as is the case in many of the countries from which the U.S. imports beef, they tend to be leaner, therefore yielding less-marbled meat.   Make sure marketing claims are legit  If a products package is littered with stickers  Natural! Free-range! Organic!  look for a second USDA sticker that says process verified or for a Global Food Safety Initiative (GFSI) stamp. If you see either one, then as a consumer, you would have very good confidence that the producer was doing what they said they were doing, says Belk. In other words, both stamps signal that the companys claims about how the meat was produced have been confirmed by a third party.   Shop for USDA-certified meat  Country-of-origin labels arent the only USDA-approved form of marketing for meat. There are several USDA-certified marketing programs  such as the Nolan Ryans Tended Aged Beef Program and Certified Angus Beef  that ensure the meat sold under these names abides by a set of standards above and beyond the law. They have to pass inspection, they have to be safe  but they also have to meet a level of quality that is quite specific, says Mills. If you buy something with the Certified Angus Beef logo on it, you know they selected from the upper two-thirds of choice, that theyve selected cattle that do not have bromine genetics. Meat from bromine cattle tends to not be as tender. So those are excluded. For a complete list of certified programs for beef, veal, pork, and lamb,  click here .   Go organic  Although organic wont tell you much about taste, says Mills, it will guarantee that synthetic fertilizers, sewage sludge, and genetic engineering havent been used during production of your meat; the animals were fed an organic diet; the livestock spent a significant amount of time grazing out on pasture; and the animals have access to the outdoors all year, according to  USDA standards ."

In 2015 Alysia Lost 65 Pounds, In 2016 She Won $1,500 in the Beachbody Challenge!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/in-2015-alysia-lost-65-pounds-in-2016-she-won-500-in-the-beachbody-challenge,"Alysia Love-Bartley lost 65 lbs. in 11 months with  PiYo ,  CIZE ,  21 Day Fix , and  21 Day Fix EXTREME . She entered her results into the  Beachbody Challenge , and won $1,500!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  In January 2015, I was depressed, discouraged, and had no hope whatsoever in losing all the weight that I had gained. While giving birth to my son in 2014, I broke my tailbone, an injury which kept me from working out and losing weight postpartum. o  I slipped into depression, and ended up gaining weight on top of my pregnancy pounds. January 2015 is when I hit the scale at 225 pounds, and my doctor said I had to do something about it. I cringe every time I hear the word obese, and to be described as obese is such a painful thing. I could deny it, and blame it on my injury and pregnancy, but it didnt make it go away. What made it go away was working hard this year,and beingable to trust programs that worked for so many other people that they just had to work for me.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I couldnt look in the mirror and be happy. I wasnt comfortable in my own skin. How was I starting off my new role as a parent by being overweight and hating myself? I really did hate myself. I was broken inside and out, and looked like hell. Then I saw my husband using  Body Beast  and drinking  Shakeology , and getting really awesome results pretty quickly. I decided that I wanted my own workout program, so I started with PiYo along with Shakeology. It didnt look intimidating, it looked relaxing wrong. It was sweat-tastic.But by the end, my body was flexible again, the muscles surrounding my tailbone were stronger and helping hold it in place better, and  I was down 25pounds! From there, it was an easy choice to continue with Shakeology and try other Beachbody programs. I went on to lose a total of 65poundsthis year with PiYo, CIZE, 21DF, and 21DFX. My biggest drops in weight were not just in the beginning of my journey, like youd think. I ended up losing 9poundsin just three weeks in December!   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  The greatest challenge I faced before taking that first step was the price.Financially, I didnt think I could, but in the bigger picture, I couldnt afford not to. Thank god  I listened to reasoning, or I wouldnt be where I am today. The emotional challenges I faced were countless, but looking back, they seem silly at times.It helps having the support, encouragement, and inspiration that comes with the program purchase. You dont just purchase a few DVDs of workouts, you get the Beachbody family with that. You have a team of Coaches and other members helping you along, pushing you when you need it the most, and listening when you just need an ear. You really make a whole new group of friends through fitness. There is nothing better than having friends that are interested in the same things, going through the same struggles, and friends that have been where you are and are the result of where you want to be. Nothing is more motivating than that!   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  Each program I finished, I felt was  my  program, like it was made just for me! My favorite is 21DFX, because its only threeweeks, and who doesnt want to drop pant sizes in such a short period of time doing it the  right  way! I followed a meal plan of healthy foods and never went hungry. It was hard around the holidays being around such tempting foods.But Ill tell ya, after 21 days, you break habits and create new ones. Particularly during the three weeks between Thanksgiving and Christmas when all of my non-fitness friends were gaining weight, I ended up dropping nine (very noticeable)  pounds ! Those sugary foods and drinks didnt taste the same! Too sugaryandtoo salty.There is absolutely nothing better than natural food to me now, which makes it even easier to continue to lose weight!     Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I went from 225poundsto 160pounds, and from size 16 to size 7/8 over 44 inches! Need I say more?! My results in 2015 achieved with Beachbody programs, Shakeology, and the support of my Beachbody family are  huge ! Im not obese. People dont recognize me now whoknew me then.People that I meet now dont believe that I was ever that big.Its crazy! Initially, I thought that if I ever could lose the weight, Id be left with sagging loose skin.But these programs tighten and tone you up as you lose the weight.So for me, that didnt happen!   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  In January, having to say, I need to lose 70pounds, seemed unrealistic and unobtainable to the point that I didnt think it was possible. Ive lost so much weight, and gained so much determination and confidence. In January, I was unhappy with everything. I even hated my job. Now, here I am in December: I love my body, I love working out, my tailbone is completely stable because of the muscle Ive built o ,  and  I even landed my dream job (and I start January 1st)! I have so many more friends, Im the  mom  I wanted to be, and Im the  wife  I should be. Going into 2016, I am the  me  Ive always wanted to be! My original 2015 goals werefar surpassed, and my new goals dont seem so impossible.In fact, comparatively, they are right within reach!   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  I was very shy in Challenge Groups at first. I stood on the sidelines, so to speak, and watched what others posted, which was enough motivation at first. Eventually, actually participating in the Challenge Groups held me accountable. I had other people asking me questions, and people that had been inspiring me were now seeking my help! By December, I was showing over 52,000 people the before pictures I was so ashamed of even my husband seeing. Try that for accountability! This year, I made awesome fitness friends across the country through Beachbody Challenge Groups, who made me feel like I  could  do it, because theyve done it. I learned how and what to eat, that non-scale victories need to be celebrated, and that sometimes you just need to give the scale time to catch up.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  My Team Beachbody Coach is actually my best friend, and husband! He inspired me with his own transformation. I saw firsthand the effort and time he put into his diet and exercise. He inspires me daily, and now he says I keep him going! He has the confidence to share his story and help others. That makes me want to push harder, reach higher, go far, and hopefully become a Coach too! Through all of the obstacles and surprises on the scale (both good and bad), he keeps me focused and reminds me how far Ive come and that the possibilities are endless.   How  did  a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your  transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/ regularity ?  The only way to lose weight that will stay off is to lose fat, gain muscle, and fuel your body with what it needs healthy, balanced nutrition and thats exactly what  Shakeology  has in it. I know that when I drink  my  drink, it has all the nutrients I need for the day.Im not depriving my bodyby just drinking some diet shake to replace a meal Im truly fueling my body!

",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-alisha-lost-35-2-pounds-with-piyo,"Alisha has spent her entire life struggling with her weight.Going through numerous tragic events caused her weight to drastically fluctuate, but it was words from her daughter that inspired her to make a lifestyle change for herself and her family. In two rounds of PiYo , she lost 35.2 pounds and 26.25 inches! Read her amazing story in her own words below:   I had been overweight since I was born I remember being almost 150 pounds by the time I was 10.I eventually went through so much verbal abuse from kids at school that I turned to anorexia when I was 16. I was down to around 110 pounds, and at 58, I was so thin and completely unhealthy. After a year of putting my body through that, I turned back to food for support. I gained everything back and was close to 200 pounds. After college, tragedy struck my life in the worst way. In a matter of 6 months, I had lost my son, my father, and my husband and I divorced. So again, I turned to food. I was steady around 190 pounds all through my second marriage, and after the birth of both of my girls, I was around 220 pounds. I was disgusted with myself.   One day, my kids took a picture of me and my 3-year-old said, Mommys a monster. That was enough to change my lifestyle and habits, so I ordered PiYo. I had no experience, and this was all new. Ive always been very weak, so PiYo seemed like it was going to give me strength without jumping and hopping around.   I love how PiYo has transformed my entire body! Im strong and lean! Everything on a day to day basis hasgotten so much easier to do. I can now do pushups and pullups. I challenge everyone to contests now  and I win!

Though he was used to being active in the military, he was never able to get results he wanted. He heard about P90X3 and decided to take a chance to improve his health for himself and his family. He lost 45 pounds and 29.7 inches in two rounds of P90X3! Read his inspiring story in his own words below:   I have never been in amazing shape. My life revolved around fatty foods and sweets. When Iwas in the military,I was deployed to Iraq in 2008. During that year,I was at the gym a lot and was in the best shape I thought I could be in. During my deployment, my wife gave birth to our first son. The day after he was born, we found out he had two severe congenital heart defects. Thankfully the Lord gave us five months with him. But after five months and three open heart surgeries, our little boy passed away. Since then, we have had two healthy children. Life got busy and my health was on the back burner. I gained a lot of weight and was not happy about the way I looked. I was always telling myself Iwas going to get in shape, but I never did.   I had lower back pain. I would tweak my back at work and would be in pain for weeks. After seeing my doctor, I was given some pills to try. I did not want to be taking a pill for something that could be fixed by improving my health. Once Ifound out about P90X3, I was excited to get in shape.   At first, I would modify most moves in the P90X3 workouts. When Ifirst started, I could only do two pull-ups, and I would then continue with the resistance bands. I wanted to keep my heart rate up to maximize my results. After the first 90 days, I could do pull-ups throughout the workout without using any modified moves!   I found the nutrition plan to be very simple as well, and it truly was the key to my success! When you have a complicated nutrition plan that is hard to comprehend, your weight-loss may suffer.

9 Yoga Stretches to Help Relieve Hip and Lower Back Pain
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/9-yoga-stretches-to-help-relieve-hip-lower-back-pain,"Tight hips can be debilitating. When things arent working right down there, even sitting or walking can cause pain. Luckily, a little (proper) stretching can ward off this pain, increase the fluidity of mobility, and decrease chances of serious injury in the lower region of your body. It can also take pressure off the lower back, decreasing chances of pain in that area.   These 8 simple poses can help both stretch and strengthen your hips, but keep in mind when moving through them to listen to that internal voice of your body that tells you if you are in pain or just feeling a stretch. A stretch may feel a little sore but inevitably it feels like a release of tension. When you feel sharp pain, back out of the pose and consider using a prop or moving on to another stretch.   Lizard-Lower Lunge  Apparently, lizards have loose hips and this hip openers moniker is testament to that. Step your left foot forward several feet in front of the right foot. Bend the left knee until it lines up perfectly with the ankle. Drop the right knee to the ground and keep the toes curled under on that foot to stretch the calf muscle. Walk the left foot out to the side and place both elbows on top of blocks on the inside edge of the left foot. Keep hips lined up parallel to each other. You are opening the right psoas muscle and the left inner thigh. To get deeper into the right psoas, lift the right knee into a high lunge.        Bound Ankle Pose  This pose requires that you bind your anklesand by doing so youll unbind your hips. Bring the soles of your feet together, pulling the heels close to your groin, bending the knees, and butterfly flare the legs open. If you notice your knees are set too high to relax, simply place a blanket right under the sit bones to prop the hips up. You can also take the feet out further from the pelvic cavity to create a diamond shape with the legs. Keeping your spine straight, lead with the chest, pull your shoulders back, and fold toward your feet. This pose will open and relax the inner thighs and groin.        Cow Face Pose  Begin by threading the left leg under your right leg. Work toward stacking the knees, while keeping both sit bones on the ground. Tuck the toes in to protect the knees. Sit in the pose for several minutes. When the muscles start to loosen and you no longer feel a stretch, fold forward with a straight spine. If this stretch is too intense, you can situate both sit bones on a blanket and place a block or blanket between the knees.        Pigeon Pose  Starting in downward facing dog, lift the right leg and step it forward between the hands. Drop the left knee down and untuck the toes. Slide the right foot over toward your left pelvic bone placing the outside edge of the right leg on the floor. Tuck the right toes in (flexing the foot). Line up hips parallel to each other, continually pressing the left hip toward the floor. If this position is too difficult, place a blanket under your bottom. To intensify the stretch, move the right foot away from the left side of your body and drop to the elbows or chest. To make this pose less intense, move the right foot closer to your right leg and stay on the hands instead of folding. This is a profound stretch to the psoas, shin, glutes, and outer hips.        Happy Baby  Its not likely you will ever hear a baby complaining about hip pain. So, make like a baby and lie flat on your back, grab hold of both feet with each hand, bend the knees and pull them toward your armpits. Once in the proper position rock side to side, keeping your head on the floor. This will externally rotate and stretch the hips, loosen the inner groin muscles, and help realign the spine.        Fire Log Pose  This pose should put the fire out in your hips. Sit on the floor with a straight spine, both sit bones pressing against the ground. Take the left leg out in front of you and bend it until it is in a straight line and parallel with your body, knee, and ankle. Stack the right leg on top of the left, lining up the right ankle to the left knee and the right knee to the left ankle. If you find the final position too difficult, you can use blocks as support to lighten the pose. This is a deep stretch to loosen the outer hips and glutes. It also stretches and strengthens the groin, calves, thighs, and abdominal muscles.        Goddess Pose  Gentlemen, do not be deterred by the name of this pose. It will help you open your hips regardless of your gender. Step your feet out very wide, turn the toes outward, bend the knees so they line up with your ankles, and tuck your butt in to engage the core. The further the toes are pointed outward, the deeper the stretch. This will give your groin, inner thighs, and hips a deep stretch.  Note: Avoid this pose if you have a knee or hip injury.        Half Lord of The Fish Pose  Sitting on the floor, extend both legs out in front of you. Keep the left leg straight and bend and pull the right leg in. Line the right heel up approximately 2 inches away from the back of the right leg and 2 inches away from the left thigh. Sit up very tall, avoiding sinking in the lower back. Wrap the left arm around the right leg, creating a spinal twist. Move the left shoulder forward as you move the right shoulder back, attempting to line the shoulders up. Take your gaze over the right shoulder. This pose stretches out the hips, glutes, lower back, spine, chest, shoulders, and neck.        Garland Pose  This pose is so effective for opening the hips that its the position most women use to give birth. Turn your heels so they line up with your hips, turn your toes outward. Bend the knees until you reach a squatted position. Place a blanket under the heels if they have to be lifted while squatting. You can also stack two blocks to sit on to work up to the full integrity of the pose. The Garland Pose increases fluidity in the hips, and stretches the ankles, knees, and lower back. It also strengthens the core muscles.     All photos by  Lulu Lam ."

Thankfully, the Lord gave us five months with him, but after five months and three open heart surgeries, our little boy went home to be with our Lord. Since then, we have had two healthy children. Life got busy, and my health was on the back burner. I gained a lot of weight, and was not happy about the way I looked. We were always telling ourselveswe were going to get in shape, but never did. Once we found out about P90X3, we were excited and on fire to get in shape. Now, I feel wonderful about how I look and feel. I no longer skip out on events because of my appearance. I enjoy my life now, and the transformation is not over!   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I am a very self-conscious person. When my clothes stopped fitting, I knew I needed to change something. After turning 30, I determined that I was going to be in the best shape of my life in my 30s and beyond. I was very unhealthy in my early 20s, so I had to make a change. Keeping up with my children after work was proving to be very difficult and exhausting. I wanted to be able to run and keep up with them, and not have to take a break! Two rounds of P90X3 and a healthy diet have gotten me to that goal. But the journey has just begun. I am determined to see an ab someday. I have always wanted to have a six-pack, but have never seen my elusive abs!   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?   Time ! Time was a challenge! After work, all I wanted to do was nothing. P90X3s 30-minute workouts helped me overcome the time issue. It was easy to fit it into my schedule. I will continue buying Beachbody programs, because they make sense of my busy schedule. No trips to the gym, no babysitters just plug it in and get your burn on! Thanks, Beachbody!     What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I loved how fast I could get my workout done and continue on with the rest of my day. Muscle confusion worked wonders! It helped keep my focus. There are so many workouts to do and so many different ways of targeting muscles. Each day, you were sore in a different area, but it was a good sore. It was akind of sore that made you know you targeted that muscle group and that you were gaining strength.   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  At first, I was out of shape, had horrible back pain, got a poor nights sleep (including arms that fall asleep), and had bad heartburn. I hadshort-sleeve shirts that I could no longer wear, and was self-conscious around friends andfamily members. I hated the way I looked and the way I felt. But after P90X3, I took my life back into control and gained my health, confidence, and self-control. My wife was by my side the whole time, and we completed the program together with great results! We helped each other push through the tough times, and are now closer because of it!   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I have more confidence in my everyday life! I feel great about how I look, and cant wait to complete another program!   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  My Coach provided words of encouragement when times were tough, and inspiring posts and motivational phrases to keep me going!   You can change your life, too.

Transformation Tuesday: Dennise Lost 20 Pounds with CIZE!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-dennise-lost-20-pounds-with-cize,"Dennise P. was feeling depressed and lackedenergyto play with her son. She had heard about CIZE from acolleague,but put off ordering it. Finally, her birthday rolled around, and she asked her husband for CIZE. He obliged, and she had great results! After doing CIZE for 6 weeks (adding in 21 Day Fix for the last two weeks), she lost 20 pounds! Check out her story in her own words right here:   I was depressed, had no energy, and my 3-year-old was suffering because mommy was too tired to play. I was always grumpy with my husband and things were just going downhill for us.   On the first day, I had a little frustration. It was difficult to keep up. I took more than 5 breaks on the first and second days. On my third and fourthdays, I was doing much better. Now I love it I always feel great, full of energy and if I ever feel down, I just dance my emotions away. Best cure ever!   My favorite workout isFull Out! Thats a beast! I love Chandelier, but Im really slow at it, and hoping to get better soon!I like that I never get sore. I sweat like a pig, but I dont get sore and that is extremely important for me. I can do CIZEevery day of the week and still feel amazing. That is very good for me because Im a massage therapist and the main reason I never wanted to do exercise was because I was avoiding to get more sore or injure myself and not be able to work.   My favorite thing about Shaun T is his voice talking to me. It is like he has all the patience in the world, and he is just waiting for me to get it. He sings his instructions and makes everything so smooth. Before starting CIZE, my dance skills were really bad! After completing CIZE, my dance skills are good!   I used CIZE for the first 30 days, and a hybrid of CIZE & 21 Day Fix for two more weeks. I lost 6 pounds in my first week , and my husband was so impressed with my results and my mood change that he ordered his own challenge pack. Now we are both coaches and on our way to being fit and healthy again. I have lost 20 pounds in less than 60 days , and I still have 50 more pounds to go! I cant wait to see my final results!

Transformation Tuesday: Kim Lost 50.5 Pounds With FOCUS T25!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-kim-lost-50-5-pounds-with-focus-t25,"Kim was extremely depressed and unhappy with her weight. She felt like no matter how hard she worked out at the gym, she couldnt lose the weight. She would cut her food intake drastically and avoided the mirror. After seeing a photo of herself in her bathing suit, she decided to take the leap with Beachbody. She lost 50.5 pounds and 31 inches in 22 weeks with FOCUS T25 ! Read her amazing story in her own words below:   My favorite thing to do is to be on the water or by the pool, but I started hating it because I was so unhappy with my appearance. On my 31st birthday, my husband asked me what I wanted to do to celebrate. He knows how much I love going on the boat and spending time with him and my friends. However, I was hesitant, because all my friends are small, and I wasnt. My husband has always been my rock. He loves me no matter what, and told me I need to stop worrying and just enjoy life. So we decided to have all our friends join us on the river for a day of celebrating. The next day I looked at the pictures, and was disgusted by the girl who was staring back at me. Who was she? I mean she looked like me, but I could see the pain in her eyes. She wasnt the happy person I once knew.   My biggest challenge was self-confidence! I let my weight control my life. I would avoid parties and get-togethers so that I didnt have to be seen. I felt like I didnt have time and nothing worked. FOCUS T25 eliminated that excuse because it was only 25 minutes a day, 5 days a week.   I did one round of Alpha and Beta, two rounds of Gamma, another round of Beta, and a final round of Alpha. I loved Gamma and did 2 rounds because I was seeing such a change in my body. My orinigal goal was to lose 15-20 pounds. I achieved my goals and even surpassed them! I never thought I could get in this great ofshape, especially after 2 C-sections and being in my 30s. I lost more than 50 pounds, reduced my body fat, and have energy that never stops.   I never thought I would say this, I am blown away by the results I got with FOCUS T25! I couldnt be happier or more proud of myself or my body. I worked hard for it, and I earned it! I literally melted! If someone told me that I could lose 50 pounds by working out 25 minutes a night, I would have never believed them. This program is for real. I still get excited when I talk about it! Its just such an amzing program.     You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/i-lost-23-pounds-with-focust25-won-1000,"Jerry T, age 53 from Unionville, VA, lost 23 lbs in 3 months with  FOCUS T25 . He entered his results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,000!  Jerry is an Independent Beachbody Coach.   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  My feet and knees told me it was time. My blood pressure and resistance to taking medications with side effects told me it was time.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I watched a couple in their 80s climb Old Rag Mountain, here in Virginia, and pass me towards the top like they were on flat land. I said I want to be that when Im in my 80s. And I will!   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  Arguing with myself about getting up at 5AM every morning and pushing play. I am my worst enemy, that enemy has been defeated, dominated, crushed!   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  Its takes me 30 minutes total to get through. I can start at 5AM and be done by 5:30AM and getting ready for work every day.   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  For the first time in my life, I have abs that show. One my goals that I achieved was to do 53 push-ups on my 53rd birthday.     How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I have more energy. My walk is different. I have people asking me how I did it. I feel more accomplished. I look better (just my opinion), and feel better   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  Her knowledge and support. Her encouragement and crazy inspiration.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  The one thing that blew me away was in the beginning I did not have Shakeology and still lost weight from following the exercise and diet plans. I found myself plateau in weight loss. Then I added  Shakeology  to the plan and immediately saw the results. My wife had plateaued as well in her weight loss, and I suggested trying Shakeology. We now have to order two bags! Incredible results!   Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program? (e.g. Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, triglycerides, etc)  I had elevated blood pressure and my cholesterol was not in a very good (healthy) range. The doctor had me on medication to help lower these numbers. These medications had side effects that I was not comfortable with. I have since taken myself off the medication and check my blood pressure regularly. I am happy to say that I am well within my healthy range and with no medications or side effects and feel great!

David’s New Year’s Resolution Paid Off — Literally
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/davids-new-years-resolution-paid-off-literally,"David C., age 45 from Springfield, MO, lost 42 lbs. with  P90X3  and  INSANITY . He entered his results into  The Beachbody Challenge  and won $1,500!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I felt like crap. Period. I was overweight, unhealthy, depressed, on daily medication, not sleeping well, and the list goes on. My jeans had gone from a loose 32-inch waistline to a tight 36 inches. I kept wearing looser and looser fitting clothing to hide my gut. I was embarrassed and ashamed of how far I had let myself go, and worse, how long I had been stuck there. I woke up almost every single day with a headache.I also had poor digestion, a horrible diet, and always got sick. I carried around tons of guilt for my weight,because ofhow it had affected my marriage (my wife Kelly always picked up my slack), for not being able to keep up with my kids, and for the bad example I was giving them.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  For a New Years resolution, I told my wife this would be the year I would finally get back in shape before our family summer vacation to the beach. By the third week in January, I had not done a thing to change and my wife showed me a picture of her friends husbands before and after pictures from his Challenge Group. The pictures were unbelievable but I knew this guy;he was my old friend, Chris Pinkston. I was envious, jealous, skeptical, and then also upset and ashamed, and my wife immediately apologized for showing me his success. Well, that was it for me. There I sat with my wife trying to convince me that I looked okay and I didnt need to do anything drastic. Nothing could have been further from the truth. I could see it in her eyes. I wanted to dig a hole and crawl into it. I texted my friend Chris that minute and told him that whatever he did, I wanted in, and no matter what happened or what excuse I made, tonot give up on me.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  Before Beachbody, I had given up. When I got married in 2000, I weighed 160 pounds. After 15 years of marriage, four kids, a business failure, and some difficult financial times, I found myself almost 50 pounds heavier, in terrible health, with no motivation, and depressed.Even my wife was beginning to lose faith in me ever doing anything more than just getting by. I had become accountable to no one. Beachbody saved my life. My Coach and good friend Chris Pinkston helped me turn it all around. Chris kept me accountable to myself and my goals. I put my P90X3 workout calendar on my wall and started making Xs for every workout. I printed out clean eating and Shakeology recipes from my Coach, and taped them up in my kitchen. I weighed in once a week, and for the first time in over 15 years, I finally saw the numbers on the scale going down.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I started with P90X3 and Tony Horton is the man. I love his wit and humor. I could not believe his age when he would be doing as many pull-ups as the younger guys, and then look at the camera and say, I believe I am 55 and they are 30.That always kept me going since I am 45 andbelieved lately that I was past my prime, never to get back in shape again. My second Challenge Group was INSANITY, with Shaun T he is an animal. I was always impressed that he would not just lead the workout, but do it all with us. I rarely kept up, but always enjoyed the challenge of trying to put as much energy into the workout as Shaun would.   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  What do they say, a picture is worth a thousand words? Did you see the guy in the before photo? I have a lot more of them at the lake, the park, all with the same tired expression.I had sore knees, a weak back and core, headaches, and would catch every little bug the kids brought home. I was always trying to just survive the days activities rather than enjoy them. I am a  whole new man  now. A phoenix has risen from the ashes! I feel great, have more energy, am more confident, and happier. Complete strangers smile back at me rather than look away. I just enrolled for class this fall at MSU to finish my degree. On my 45th birthday in April, I ran 45 kilometers (about 28 miles) it took me almost 6 hours nonstop, but I finished just to prove to myself that I wasnt past my prime or giving up on life. All of this is great, but the single greatest achievement, the one that means most to me, the only one that matters, is how my wife, Kelly, looks at me. I know Ive made her proud.     How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  My friends and family are all beside themselves. I cant go to work,church, or anywhere without seeing someone and getting the Holy cow! and Dude! and How did you do it? responses. I gotta say, it feels really good to hear and see everyones reactions. I am married with fourkids; the oldest, my son Mitchell, is 14 and has already outgrown me. He used to shoot hoops alone in the backyard while I laid on the couch. Now, he has a hard time keeping up with me as we go one-on-one. My wife and I take our four young kids on hikes rather than sit around the house watching TV or staring atour devices (iPhones). I feel like someone could take a snapshot of my life right now and create a Norman Rockwell painting.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  I love the Challenge Groups! I tried INSANITY without a Challenge Group a couple of years ago, and lasted two weeks before I told myself that it was too hard, I was past my prime, and that I could never be in the same shape as the people in the video. I immediately put back on the few pounds I had lost and more. I recently completed my second Challenge Group. My first was P90X3 for 90 days, and then I did the original INSANITY for the last 60 days. I loved checking in with everyone daily getting motivation and tips from my Coach, and being inspired to keep up with it as I saw everyone elses progress. I have made so many new friends in just the last few months from just these two Challenge Groups.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  It is not possible to over-praise my Coach, Chris. I have tried to work out, get in shape, and lose weight on my own for years, and I even tried a Beachbody program in the past on my own but with little to no success. The  only  reason I signed up for a Challenge Group with Beachbody wasbecause I saw an incredible before and after transformation on social media, and then I realized that the guy in the pictures was a friend of mine. I have always wondered if the photos you see online are legitimate transformations, but knowing that my friend had just completed it, I knew it was possible for me too. My Coach, Chris, was constantly there to help, answer questions, give support and guidance, pick me up after I fell off my clean eating wagon, and encourage and push me to be the absolute best that I can. I would not have lasted a week without him. I owe the 20or more years that Ive added to my life all to him.   How did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, or digestion/regularity?  I am sure everyone says this, but  Shakeology  is the best. I have always used protein powder shakes and supplements, and I have shopped at places like GNC since high school, but nothing has given me the boost I got from Shakeology. My favorite thing now is just a simple chocolate Shakeology with ice, 1/4 cup oatmeal, half a banana, and a splash of skim milk.   H ow did a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program affect any existing health conditions you have ?  Before starting Beachbody, I wason a prescription migraine medication, Sumatriptan 100 mg, for over 10 years. I used to take an as needed pill on almost a daily basis. The last appointment I had with my doctor was so that I could be switched to a daily prescription medication, because I was overusing the as needed one. I was constantly missing out on family activities and missing work, because my head was throbbing, I couldnt see straight, and Iwanted to puke. It was so badthatit even wore out my wife having to pick up my slack with our kids. Since starting the P90X3 program, I have gone from an almost daily pill the first month, to taking fivepills the second month, to only onein the third month, and during the last twomonths of INSANITY, I have not needed any. I am  completely  off a 10- year  prescription for migraines, and I have never felt better in my life! My wife is beside herself and convinced that Ihave added 20 years to my life.   Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody supplement, nutritional product, or program (e.g. blood pressure, blood sugar, triglycerides, etc.)?  When I started the first Challenge Group on Feb. 2, I was in the obese category on the BMI rating scale. I couldnt believe it when my body fat percentage came in at 29.5 percent. Two days ago, I tested it again and it is 17.9 percent! Sweet! Also, my blood pressure before was always in the 160 over 115 range. Yesterday, my blood pressure was 126 over 92.  Booyah!   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Fitspiration Friday: How I Got the Strength to Save Three People
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/fitspiration-friday-how-i-got-the-strength-to-save-three-people,"If youve tried a Beachbody program, youve probably had a goal in mind that you wanted to achieve. Maybe you wanted to lose weight. Maybe you wanted to get stronger. Maybe you wanted to improve your health. Maybe it was a mix of all three, or something else entirely. But, along the way, no matter what your goal, everyone needs a little inspiration. Every other Friday, the Beachbody Success Stories team will be sharing inspirational fitness stories from some of the folks who have done Beachbody programs. Maybe one will inspire you!      Meet Dennis, a Florida man who not only got fit using T25 andP90X3,but who also used his newfound strength in an incredible way.   I was driving to pick up my daughter from school when, suddenly, a car sped out in front of me. It jumped the curb and went down a hill into the lake. I immediately pulled my truck over, jumped out, and ran to the edge of the water. The car was already floating towards the center.   I thought, Ive told my kids nevergo into a lake because of alligators . I dismissed the thought and ran into the lake. I swam to the car as it floated further in. Finally, I grabbed the door handle of the driver side. It was locked. I couldnt see in the car because only my head was sticking out of the water and the car was higher than I was. The windows were up. I banged on the window and yelled. There was no immediate answer.   Then, I heard a man inside say, I cant. My heart dropped because I knew there was no way I would be able to get inside. It was terrifying knowing I couldbe watching someone die in front of me and was completely helpless. I yelled to him. You have to get out!   Then the window went down. I boosted myself up on the windowsill. Inside was a man in his thirties. His kids were in the backseat. I asked if they could swim. He said that his seven-year-old daughter could, but his four-year-old son could not. I could feel panic start to come on, but I stayed focused. He put the back window down as far as it would go.     I tried to pull the daughter out through the window, but she was stuck. She had grabbed her bookbag and it wouldnt fit through the window. The car had started to nosedive in the water. I had no leverage, because the front of the car was sinking and the back of the car was up in the air. I finally got her, her bookbag, and her brother out. The man climbed out and we started to swim to shore, which was about 25 yards away.   The two kids were holding on my back and I had the girls bag on my arm. The man swam next to us. About 5-10 yards from the edge, I began to run out of energy and knew I was very close to complete exhaustion. I started to scream for help. I didnt realize that I was only feet from being able to touch the lake bottom until a man ran into the water and pulled me and the kids to the shallow edge. We had made it.     Later on, I talked with my wife Cindy (who is also my coach) about the experience. If she hadnt talked me into changing my workout routine, I dont know if I could have saved those people. Since 1995, I had been just pumping iron. Cindy got me doing FOCUS T25 , and I dropped 20-25 pounds which made me lighter in the water. Then I did P90X3 , which had been making me stronger and helped me build full body strength and endurance. I know God works in mysterious ways, and I believe it was Gods intervention that made me change a 19-year habit of doing things my way. I always had the heart to do what I did that day, but I dont think I would have had the strength and endurance to do it. Since then, Ive completed Body Beast , as well.   I was awarded a Certificate of Commendation from the local Fire Department. A year later I received a Good Samarian Award from the Sherriffs Office. I feel like my lifes purpose has been fulfilled. Three people are alive today. Oh, and one more note: The 4-year-old boy? He celebrated his 5 th birthday the next day."

That Viral Coke Infographic Is Wrong. Here’s What Really Happens.
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/that-viral-coke-infographic-is-wrong-heres-what-really-happens,"Not-so-shocking newsflash: drinking soda isnt very good for you. A viral infographic made its way onto the Internet last week, breaking down what happens to your body within an hour of drinking a can of Coke. While it makes some decent points about sugar and caffeine, its approach is verydramatic. The infographics creator,  The Renegade Pharmacist , used the information from an article originally published on  Blisstree . Its clear neither websites are fans of the fizzy beverage (full disclose: ours isnt either), but the alarmist approach belies some interesting facts.   So I sat down with three of Beachbodys nutrition experts to put it in perspective. Heres the real science on The Real Thing.      What Really Happens When You Drink Soda?   In the first 10 minutes   Infographic claim:  10 teaspoons of sugar hit your system. (100% of your recommended daily intake.) You dont immediately vomit from the overwhelming sweetness because phosphoric acid cuts the flavor, allowing you to keep it down.   What actually happens:  You ingest 10 teaspoons (39 grams) of sugar, which undoubtedly is a lot. In fact, this is more than  American Heart Associations  recommended daily limit, which is no more than nine teaspoons for men and six teaspoons for women. But a 12 fl. oz. Starbucks Vanilla Frappuccino has 69 grams of sugar, the light version has 39 grams of sugar, and the drink doesnt contain phosphoric acid. I dont know about you, but I havent ever seen someone gag when drinking a Frappuccino.   Dr. Nima Alamdari, Beachbody Director of Scientific Affairs, says the infographic is mostly fluff. The sugar level can be problematic, particularly in a sedentary lifestyle and when frequency of consumption is a factor, but the idea that this would typically induce a vomiting reflex is just fictional.   If your glycogen and blood glucose is depleted, sugar is actually good for you, says Steve Edwards, VP of Fitness and Nutrition. Coke works okay as a sports food. The problem is that most people use it far more for watching sports, not playing them, and then, that much sugar is definitely detrimental to you health.   When over-consumed, sugar can be pretty toxic, but claiming it will cause you to vomit is asinine, states an irritated Denis Faye, Director of Nutrition. There are plenty of ways to slam Coke without making things up!   What about phosphoric acid? It cuts the sweetness in soda and provides colas their tangy flavor, but none of the three believe it has anything to do with keeping your from retching. Think of all the sodas that dont contain phosphoric acid, adds Faye. Whens the last time someone yakked after downing a can of Sprite? I mean, one not spiked with rum, of course.   It does, however, have some other issues, which well look at later.      Within 20 minutes   Infographic claim:  Your blood sugar spikes, causing an insulin burst. Your liver responds to this by turning any sugar it can get its hands on into fat. (And theres  plenty  of that at this particular moment.)   What actually happens:  Your blood sugar does spike, causing a burst of insulin. Thats because insulin controls blood sugar levels, which is  totally normal . When you bring sugar (or any food) into the body, you need insulin to regulate it.   What about the fat production? Its certainly not a blanket statement you can make, says Edwards. If your body is depleted, the sugar will go right to work helping your body recover. If youre not, it can be stored in adipose (fat) tissue but its a stretch to say that will happen with the sugar in one Coke. Habitual drinking, yes, but thats not what the infographic is claiming.   This is why  drinking 10 Cokes a day  can quickly lead to weight gain. But is a single soda going to cause you to blow up like a balloon? No.      Within 40 minutes   Infographic claim:  Caffeine absorption is complete. Your pupils dilate; your blood pressure rises; as a response, your liver dumps  more sugar  into your bloodstream. The adenosine receptors in your brain are now blocked, preventing drowsiness.   What actually happens:  Your body absorbs the caffeine, which may dilate your pupils and raise your blood pressure, but 12 fl. oz. of Coke has only about 29 mg of caffeine. I say only because 8 oz. of green tea has between 24 and 45 mg of caffeine, and a cup of coffee can have 260 mg.   To make this claim over 29 grams of caffeine is preposterous! exclaims Faye. Sure, people sometimes drink more than one can in a sitting, but you can drink an entire Big Gulp and still take in less caffeine than an 8-ounce cup of coffee.   The description for the metabolism of a very low dose of caffeine is dramatized, adds Dr. Alamdari. From a physiological and health perspective, the level of caffeine is not problematic.   Now, lets tackle the second part of the claim.  Adenosine  is a neuromodulator in your central nervous system that facilitates sleep. Caffeine blocks the adenosine receptors, which prevents you from becoming drowsy. Yes, this part of the infographic is technically correct, but an intake of low-dose caffeine isnt some big scary monster and this makes it sound like a set up for the next big horror movie.   In my experience, most people drinking Coke want this effect, so the point is moot, says Edwards. Yet, they still managed to exaggerate it.      Within 45 minutes   Infographic claim:  Your body ups your dopamine production, stimulating the pleasure centers of your brain. This is physically the same way heroin works, by the way.   What actually happens:  Your body increases dopamine production because of both the sugar and caffeine in the soda. Dopamine is a neurotransmitter that interacts in the pleasure centers of your brain. Yes, heroin increases dopamine levels. But so does  eating bananas . And exercising. And watching the Three Stooges. Its all a matter of perspective.   Im the first to admit Coke has an addictive quality, although Id argue its more psychological, thanks to decades of marketing telling us how its the key to happiness and world peace, says Faye. But you have a Coke and a smile, not a Coke and a nod-off. Comparing it to heroin is every bit as propagandistic as those insipid Share-a-Coke ads.      After 60 minutes (Part 1)   Infographic claim:  The phosphoric acid binds calcium, magnesium, and zinc in your lower intestine, providing a further boost in metabolism. This is compounded by high doses of sugar and artificial sweeteners also increasing the urinary excretion of calcium.   What actually happens:  They had a chance to make a valid point here and they completely dropped the ball, says Faye, referring to a 2006 study in the  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition  linking lower bone density and kidney disease with women who consumed cola daily (as opposed to other sodas). The problem is, if you read the study, youll see that the researchers dont pin the issue on phosphoric acid. They suggest that it could be the caffeine, phosphoric acid, cola extract, or the carbonation, but then go on to cite several studies discounting all those theories.   Those four things individually are generally okay, so its probably the alchemy of them all mixed together, hypothesizes Faye. Or it could be that people who drink cola tend to drink less healthier caffeinated beverages, like coffee and teawhich have actually been shown to be good for your bones.   So long story short, yes something about cola may mess with your bones, but theyre not sure what, which doesnt make for a good infographic.   And by the way, cola  isnt the only place  you find phosphoric acid. Its also in meat and dairy products. And while this infographic might exaggerate its effects, it still probably isnt great to consume in large quantities. It does make a fantastic  rust remover , though.      After 60 minutes (Part 2)   Infographic claim:  The caffeines diuretic properties come into play. (It makes you have to pee.) It is now assured that youll evacuate the bonded calcium, magnesium, and zinc that was headed to your bones as well as sodium, electrolytes, and water.   What actually happens:  Caffeine is a diuretic, and that does give you the urge to run to the bathroom. Yes, you will release some nutrients. But the amount is so minimal that its hardly even worth mentioning. Coffee makes you pee more often because of the diuretic properties of caffeine, but its unlikely youre suffering from weakness after your mid-morning bathroom break. Studies have shown that caffeine is actually extremely beneficial to  athletic performance,  and the amount study participants consumed was  way more  than the 29 mg found in Coke.      After 60 minutes (Part 3)   Infographic claim:  As the rave inside you dies down, youll start to have a sugar crash. You may become irritable and/or sluggish. Youve also now, literally, pissed away all the water that was in the Coke. But not before infusing it with valuable nutrients your body could have used for things like hydrating your system, or building strong bones and teeth.   What actually happens:  First of all, if theres a crazy dance party going on inside of you every time you drink a Coke, you might have some other issues that need to be looked into. In reality, its true that at this point you will start to feel the effects of your blood sugar levels crashing. This occurs because your body is adjusting from a high level of blood sugar to a lower level of blood sugar. You might start to feel irritable and/or sluggish. Just talk to any kid at the end of an ice cream-and-cake-filled birthday party.   This statement is actually true for the most part, says Edwards. Unless youre using it during and post activity, you will spike and fade to some degree. And this effect can be pronounced in some people.   I agree with Steve, adds Faye. Sugar crashes are a fact of life for junk food junkies.   Im certainly not a soda fan, says Edwards. I dont drink it and I wrote an article calling it the worst food on the planet, which I believe it is. But  that piece cites logic, reason, and actual statics. Its not just alarmist drivel.   Im not a soda fan, full stop. Mainly because these high sugar drinks are a major contributor to the obesity epidemic we are experiencing says Dr. Alamdari. But, Im also not a fan of hype articles with a clear lack of evidence-basis behind them. It feeds secondhand misinformation to readership that deserves better.   Soda has no redeeming qualities. Period, states Faye. But the same can be said for  American Pie  sequels and I like watching those every so often. Its just a matter of knowing when to watchor drinksomething healthier.   Drinking a can of cola every now and then might not wreak total havoc on your entire body like this infographic makes it seem, but if it helps you stop drinking soda, perhaps its a good thing, whether theyre making it up or not."

The Ultimate Comeback Story: Sober, Strong, and Swaggerlicious!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/everything-is-better-everything,"Greg Cordosi, age 54, lost 53 lbs with  Body Beast  and  P90X3 . He entered his results into  The Beachbody Challenge , and won $1,500!  Greg is an Independent Beachbody Coach.    Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  This is my second session with Beachbody. I did the Body Beast workout from February 2, 2015 until the middle of July (I was a daily Prize winner of $500!), then started the P90X3 program and became a Coach! I had almost the same experience all over again it was amazing. My body continues to change in ways I would never have thought possible. I wanted Tony Horton to tone me up and lean me out and thats exactly what he did. Im still shocked when I see myself in the mirror. Everywhere I go people comment on how amazing I look. I maxed out at 275 and now I weigh just 178, and I am  hard ! I know it sounds self aggrandizing but I have never met anyone who has done what I did. Honestly I cant think of anyone who even got close without some surgery or fad diet. I did it the right way with a nice healthy diet,  Shakeology , protein powder, lean meats, fruits, and veggies. I took my time, never panicked, and let the workouts work their magic on me, and they did.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I was a savage alcoholic for a few years after losing everything in my life when the recession hit. I lost my business of 20 years, the building it was housed in, my home, my wife, almost three million dollars, and ultimately my sobriety. It nearly cost me my life. I finally was able to put that experience behind me last June by checking myself into rehab. I was a total physical mess. My BP when I checked in was 212/115. I was on the verge of death. I got sober in rehab and then continued that path when I got out. I got involved in AA, and actually started volunteering my time at the rehab I was a patient in as my sober journey continued. My sober b-day is the same as my belly button birthday May 31st. I turned 54 years old, and was one year sober on 5/31/15. Im about to graduate from college (12/15), the last thing I needed to change was my body and my confidence. Ive done that!  I am Swaggerlicious!   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  My confidence level was at an all time low. I was a guy who grew up with mad swag and confidence, but I had lost so much so fast that it all went away. I felt like an absolute loser, and I let myself go because I simply didnt care. When I got sober (5/31/14), and my mind started to heal I knew I had to do something to really jump start my confidence again and honestly this was a total shot in the dark. I thought I was too old, too far gone, and could never stay interested long enough for it to work.  I was wrong!  The changes in my body, spurred my mind into a positive thought mode, and the craziest thing happened, my mind and my body just fed off one another. Suddenly my whole life had a momentum that it had never had before, and I rode it to where I am today. Beachbody is the single greatest thing to happen to my mind and body. I have a loyal FB following that love to see my progress and cheer me on. Its been so much fun. I love Tony, Sagi, and everything about Beachbody!     What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I liked the P90X3 even more than Body Beast. I thought Tony Horton was absolutely perfect for me. I loved the way he explained the workouts, what they did for the body, and the way he conducted the workouts themselves. I was  never  bored, and always engaged in the process. I looked forward to every single day, and found myself starting to panic as the 90 day mark was getting closer and closer. The best thing about the workouts themselves was they were just complicated enough to keep my mind busy on what my mind was doing allowing me to just work hard and not dread the exercise itself at all. The thirty minutes flew by!   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I am most proud of the huge weight loss, and the effect it had on me mentally. I have lost almost 60 pounds in just eight total months between the two programs (Body Beast and P90X3), and I dont just walk the walk I strut it. Doing these programs allowed me to believe in myself again. When I bought the Body Beast DVDs I didnt really believe they would work, or that I had the discipline to do it the right way, but after that experience I knew the day I ordered the P90X3 DVDs that I was going to be done 90 days later and I was. Thats the difference in who I am today. I know its going to happen because I am totally in control of my mind and body!   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?   Everything is better, everything!  I feel great, I look great, I get tons of compliments, and I can wear anything in my closet. My mental attitude is 100% positive. I am really as happy as I can be right now. I still have a lot of struggles ahead of me, but this program has given me the confidence that I can change anything in my life that I put my mind too. Just look at my before and after photos. What an amazing difference. The other major change is the respect I have earned from virtually everyone. Even my evil brother ( lol ), has had to begrudgingly give me my props for the changes I made. I have no doubt that after graduation in December of 2015 this program will play a huge role in the next job I land. If I can do this anyone can, and I believe it with all my heart!   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

What You May Not Know About Postpartum Depression
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/what-you-may-not-know-about-postpartum-depression,"Its not surprising that many new moms find themselves in a funk right after having a baby. Hormones are out of whack, sleep is a distant memory, and your entire  life  has been turned upside down by an adorable little squish, who is (no pressure!) totally dependent on you for everything.   So, yeah, a mild case of the baby blues is both normal and understandable.   But for many women, the funk doesnt go away after those first few weeks. According to the  American Psychological Association , as many as 16 percent of women experience postpartum depression, a more prolonged and severe illness.   Postpartum depression and the baby blues share many symptoms, including mood swings, crying jags, sadness, insomnia, and irritability, says Dr. Michelle Golland, a clinical psychologist in Hollywood, CA. But while the baby blues only last a few weeks, PPD symptoms stick around longer, and symptoms  can be more severe, including finding difficulty in caring for your newborn and suicidal thoughts.   Many people think of postpartum depression as something that only strikes during the first few months of mommyhood. New moms are typically screened for postpartum depression after the birth and again at their post-baby checkup.   But PPD can actually strike anytime within the first postpartum year. Researchers at Olmsted Medical Center recently  discovered  that when follow-up screenings were given at the six-month and one-year marks, there was a significant increase in the number of PPD cases. This may not be late-onset PPD. It may be the emergence of symptoms that have been lingering under the surface,  says Karen Kleiman, MSW, LCSW, founder of The Postpartum Stress Center and author of Therapy and the Postpartum Woman .      How can postpartum depression go unnoticed for so long?  For starters, the symptoms of depression mirror the symptoms ofwellhaving a newborn in the house. Youre stressed, youre exhausted, you see your friends less, and you find yourself weeping at home makeover shows. (Erso Ive heard.)   Kleiman says moms, may confuse their symptoms for normal postpartum experiences and not be able to tell the difference between being tired and being unable to function well.   At that first post-baby checkup, none of those things might seem worth mentioning. But screen again at six months, and a woman may think:  Hey, this has been going on for a while now, and it doesnt feel normal.   Even if a new mom does suspect somethings wrong, she may put off reporting her symptoms due to the stigma surrounding mental illnessespecially since societal expectations tell her shes expected to be bursting with baby bliss. They may be getting messages from their support network to be strong or power through, Kleiman says. They may feel if they tell anyone what they are really thinking, someone will think they are crazyor worse, take their baby away from them.   The recent research indicates that additional screenings could play a key role in helping to identify more women who may be at risk, so theyre able to get the treatment they need. Postpartum women should be screened repeatedly, Kleiman says. A low screen score does not necessarily mean she is out of the woods. A woman is most at risk for emotional illness during and after pregnancy than at any other time in her life. She should be monitored closely during these times.   Until these additional screenings become the norm, its important to tune in to your own emotionsand listen to concerned friends who may be able to recognize your symptoms before you can.  There is no shame in seeking help.   Please remember that self-care is  not  selfish and that your baby needs you to be emotionally well, says Dr. Golland, who struggled with PPD herself as a new mom. Give yourself breaks when needed: baths, time with friends, and whatever else your brain and body need to feel solid and grounded. Its also critical that you get enough sleep; being sleep-deprived can have a snowball effect for new moms leading to PPD. Talk about how youre feeling and the symptoms youre struggling to manage. I would also encourage fathers and other family members to know the warning signs of PPD and to intervene when needed."

“I Lost Weight and Kept it Off!”
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/i-lost-weight-and-kept-it-off,"Meet Pam L.,  age 61 from Flowery Branch, GA. She has been workinghard to avoid type II diabetes and the heart diseases that run in her family,and she won $1,500 in the Beachbody Challenge !   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  For years I exercised 3-4 times a week, yet continued to gain weight. Id fluctuate by 10 pounds, but nothing more. In the summer of 2013, I suffered a knee injury that a few months later required surgery. At that time I weighed 235 pounds. I was frustrated and depressed by my inability to change my situation. I was truly terrified that I wouldnt be able to avoid the diabetes, asthma and COPD issues that seemed to plague my family.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I had been fighting the battle of the bulge since my 40th birthday, but I was losing. I was well on my way to contracting the family tendency toward type II diabetes, COPD, high blood pressure, etc. I was looking for a solution that would work for me in town and while traveling. In January 2014. I started drinking Shakeology and moving towards healthier eating. I lost weight and kept it off ! It was so inspiring that I decided to take it to the next level and incorporate home workouts that I could do at home and when traveling.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  The biggest challenge remaining was how to eat healthy when out of town and eating out. Im not always in charge of the food selections and counting calories was difficult because I wouldnt know how the food was prepared. with the containers, Ive been able to visualize the portion size and cut down on overeating when in these eating out circumstances. Now, I can eat just what would have fit into a container and select dishes more compatible with my bodys needs.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I liked the portion control and the use of weights and resistance band to increase my strength in my arms and legs.   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  Even though I still have a way to go to reach my personal weight and fitness goals, I remain determined. Im currently proud of the fact that I dont look like Im 61. It feels good when people notice the changes Ive been able to accomplish.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I tell anyone who will listen how I changed my life and saved myself from the illness path common to my family. Im also proud of the fact that several family members have begun their own fitness journeys after seeing what Ive been able to accomplish. It doesnt hurt that Ive had to go to a smaller size clothing either.   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  Doing the work was necessary to gain the strength and sculpting that occurred. The challenge group was very supportive, especially when I went on business trips. I continued to work out every day and the group acknowledged and supported my efforts. It kept me going!   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  My Coach supported me through her posts and participation in the Challenge Group herself.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?  I drink  Shakeology  every day, usually for breakfast. It gives me the energy to do the things that I want to do, including my workouts. I know that I can count on being alert and energetic.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?  Im not scheduled for a physical until May, but I havent been sick since I started drinking Shakeology. However, Im expecting to see that Ive moved away from the pre-diabetic level when it rolls around again. At my last physical, my triglycerides were phenomenal; cholesterol was lower and my HemoA1c number was holding steady. This was an important number for me as it meant I might be winning against my familys tendency to develop Type II diabetes. In fact, at my last physical, the nurse wanted to know how I mange such a great triglycerides number!   Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program? (e.g. Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, triglycerides, etc)  The workout programs that Ive participated in have allowed me to strengthen my weak knee and reduce the pain I had previously experienced. Without these programs, including 21 Day Fix EXTREME, and Shakeology, I would not have been able to reduce my BMI to a healthier level. I continue to work out daily and am confident that Ill reach my fitness goal soon.   You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed! Complete any Beachbody program, and enter your results for a free gift and a chance to win cash and prizes."

Transformation Tuesday: Chanelle Lost 18.6 Pounds with FOCUS T25!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-chanelle-lost-18-6-pounds-with-focus-t25,"Chanelle M. was tired, unhealthy, and she wanted to make a change. She couldnt afford the time or money it took to join a gym, so she bought FOCUS T25 and got to work. In two rounds, she lost 18.6 lbs and 22.5 inches! Read her story in her own words right here:   In January of 2014, as my birthday approached, I started to reflect on the past year and the year ahead. I purposely didnt make a New Years Resolution that year because it was always the same thing and I rarely reached it- to get myself back into shape. My neighbor had mentioned FOCUS T25 to me a couple of times, but I knew myself and workout DVDs: I would start them and never keep up with them. As I was driving home from work one day in tears because I was so frustrated that I was tired and exhausted all of them time and I just wasnt happy with myself , I knew I had to change something and that I was the only person that could make that change.   I wanted to be a happy mom and one that had energy for my boys. I was so self-conscious that I was still hanging onto pre-pregnancy weight and my youngest son was almost 16 months old. I would go to get ready for work, a date with my husband or a girls night and end up crying in the closet because my clothes wouldnt fit right, and it made me not want to go anywhere. No matter how hard I worked with making healthier choices, the weight just wouldnt leave. I decided I had enough. I told my husband the week of my birthday that I was going to order FOCUS T25 and I didnt care if it had to be a birthday present. Our ten year anniversary was in August and I really wanted to fit back into the dress I wore for our rehearsal dinner and we were also going to the beach with my family in June, so I had two things to set in front of me as goals. Honestly though, I just wanted my body back and to feel better about who I was.   I wanted to show my boys how to live a healthy life, but I didnt have the money for a gym membership and I knew I didnt have the time to leave my family and go to the gym to workout. With two little ones, both my husband and I working, time was a big excuse for me. FOCUS T25 eliminated those excuses! I could always make time for 25 minutes. We didnt just have the extra money laying around to buy FOCUS T25 so I actually purchased it on our credit card. I hadnt ever stuck with a DVD workout and spending that money I think pushed me to really dedicate myself because I knew my husband thought it was just one more thing I was trying and I wanted to prove that the money I spent was worth it!   About a week after I purchased the program my friend posted on Facebook that she was going to be leading a FOCUS T25 accountability group. She had just finished month 1 of the program and shared her results and I was inspired! Her before and after pictures looked amazing and she was my friend, I knew her! So having that personal connection to her made me really want to stick with FOCUS T25. I asked to join her group and worked out with other moms all over to keep me motivated through the private Facebook group that she set up. That challenge group was exactly what I needed! My friend, now coach, was motivating and encouraging throughout the entire challenge and I felt like I connected with the other women in the group, as well. It was nice to be able to workout at home but still have a connection with other women. I also realized accountability with my nutrition and my workouts was the missing piece in my life.   When it was time for me to do my weigh in the first week, I was shocked! I not only had lost 2 pounds, but I had lost 2 inches off of my waist. I was sore and I was frustrated because the workout was harder for me, but seeing results within the first week was so encouraging! I was working on eating clean as well, and it was easier to do with that accountability. Throughout my first month I started to also notice that I was getting stronger, I was able to do more moves and I had more energy to play with my boys. I noticed it was easier to get the large double stroller in and out of the back of my trunk of the car, these little things all started to show me that FOCUS T25 was doing so much for me.   Throughout the weeks, I started to notice my moods were better, I had more energy and didnt just want to come home and sit on the couch; I wanted to be up and active with my boys. By the end of the program, I was amazed because I had never had completed anything like FOCUS T25 or had results like what I was experiencing. I had gone to gyms before and taken exercise classes, but I had never had results like I was having. To see the numbers on the scale continue to drop and my clothes getting too big felt amazing!   One of the greatest results from FOCUS T25, though, was that I gained my confidence back. That right there is what I want for my kids. I want to be a confident mom, and I am now! My boys are 4  and 2  and now they enjoy working out with me when they can, and talk about healthier food choices on their own. I want to be an example for them now so that as they grow up they know how to take care of their bodies. I didnt grow up eating clean foods and that is something that FOCUS T25 helped me with as well. Our family eats clean now, we follow the 80/20 rule as much as we can. Today I am smiling more, I am a better mom and I enjoy shopping and going out with friends and family again.   After having such amazing results, I decided to sign up to be a coach. I wanted the ongoing accountability with my health and fitness but I also really wanted to pay it forward and help other women just like me that were moms who believed their bodies were just going to look a certain way after having kids. To this day I know I will never go back to where I was. I feel absolutely amazing, I am in the best shape of my life after having kids and I want others to have the same results! FOCUS T25 really taught me that we are made to thrive and not just survive. When you take ownership for where you are, have accountability and are responsible for doing your part and are consistent, you can achieve anything and will have great results!   I tried on that dress I wanted to wear to celebrate our 10 th wedding anniversary and it was way too big! I not only reached my goals with FOCUS T25, I exceeded them, which shows me I really am in the best shape of my life! I am holding onto that dress as a reminder of how far I have come.

Beachbody Results: Stephanie Lost 169 Pounds
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/that-warrior-spirit-is-awake-in-me,"Meet independent Beachbody Coach Stephanie T., age 42 from Tallahassee, FL.   She entered The Beachbody Challenge in May 2015 and won $1,500!   Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I have always had a struggle with my weight. In school, I can remember kids making up a song about me, and they would sing it every time I would walk by  BBTbye bye tree. It was their way of calling me big butt. From the time I was young, I had people continuously tell me that I wasnt good enough. And I believed them. I let those voices define my life, so I buried myself under baggy clothes and continued to gain weight into my adult life. My life was on cruise control, but no one was behind the wheel. I was tired and sluggish all the time. After a meal, I would often have to go lay down for awhile. Going back to graduate school in my late 30s just added to the mix of stress and life issues. Sleep was a luxury. Sometimes I would forget to eat, and then when I did eat, it was just whatever I could find to stuff in my face at the time. My hair was starting to fall out in clumps from stress and poor nutrition  at age 39, I was going bald, and I was miserable.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  I was tired of always being the fat friend. I was tired of feeling like all eyes were on me when I ate. I was tired of never having any energy to do things. I had a friend ask me to go kayaking with her, which is something that I have always wanted to do, but I knew that I couldnt go because the kayaks wouldnt hold my weight. I felt like I died a little inside that day. I realized that I was letting my weight control me, the stress take over. My 40th birthday was approaching, and I knew it was time to take control of my body. I wanted to prove all the voices wrong  all those who told me throughout my life that I wasnt good enough or that I wouldnt amount to anything. It was time to reclaim and re-energize my life. This was my time to stop burying my true self beneath all this weight and let my light shine. I was ready to make a change and was willing to step up to do whatever I needed to do to make it happen.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  My greatest challenge was my self-esteem and energy to exercise. I had convinced myself over a long period of time that I was never going to be active again, and so when I did exercise, I gave up really quickly. My self-esteem was so low, that I hated having photos taken. I couldnt stand to look at myself. Finding Beachbodychanged that.Beachbody programsbrought me mentally/spiritually/physically to an entirely different level  one that is much more centered and confident. The energy of the music and the spirit of the trainers made me want to push play every dayregardless of what was going on outside my time (my workout time). Going through dissolving a marriage, finishing graduate school, and piecing life back togetherBeachbody hasgiven me the strength to move forward and reach for the possibilities held in tomorrows sunrise.   What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  Beachbody programschallengedme in all ways  physically, spiritually, and mentally. The music used in the program is fantastic and keeps me going, and I simply just love the energy of the team of trainers. I love the strength and endurance I get from this workout program, not to mention that I feel so athletic doing it. Ive always wanted to feel and look like an athlete.Beachbodyis making that a reality for me. It was so cool to put on a tank top the other day and watch as my friends jaw hit the floor and hear her say Wow! You look so athletic!   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I love feeling and looking like an athlete. I feel stronger, inside and out. And I am so proud of the fact that I can now look at myself in the mirror and smile. I see those little bones right below my neck. I see curves in my shoulders and all my muscles taking shape. I love the compliments that I receive. Someone said you look like an entirely different person! The thing is, I feel like an entirely different person! I am not the same person who started this program back in December 2012. I have muscles. I have definition. I have confidence. I am more aware of how my body operates and what it takes to make it change for the better. And defeating those burpees  that in and of itself is a milestone of an accomplishment! The first time I completed every burpee in a workout, I cant tell you how happy that made me! At 42 yrs of age, I feel better now than I have ever felt in my life.   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  I have become addicted to fitness. I cant wait to push play. I believewhen they sayif you think youre tough, you probably will be tough. I feel tougher. I am thankful every single day that I get to keep changing my body and my spirit. Ive come a long way, but every day, every round, I challenge myself to master something new. I feel like I can take on any and all obstacles that stand in my path because I now have the confidence to make change happen. Working withBeachbodyopened the door to becoming a Coach. I love being able to give to others what this journey of fitness has given to me. I just started Round 14!Beachbody programs aremy energy, heart, and soul therapy! That warrior-spirit is awake in me, and I feel alive again!   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  The Challenge Group keeps me focused. The group members have been my rock and my family. When I feel like the world is crushing down around me, my group lifts me up and keeps me going. And when they have bad days, I am able to give back to them what they have given to me. We give each other hope. Having a Challenge Group has kept me motivated. I know that I am responsible to check in with them every day. So good days or bad days, I know that I cannot let my team down  I must push play and keep moving forward.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  Christina is an amazing woman and Coach. Shes very encouraging and incredibly genuine in her desire to see each member of her team succeed with their programs. She always leaves small notes of encouragement in my inbox on Facebook or on our team pages. Each day, she keeps encouraging us to reach our goals. I am grateful for having met Christina and becoming a part of her Beachbody team. She has become my good friend, my hero, and mentor. She has seen the potential in me, even when I havent been able to see it. I cannot thank her enough for believing in me. In the times when I didnt or couldnt believe in myself, Christina believed for me. She reached out to me in a time of need and lifted me up.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?   Shakeology  has become a part of my life  daily. I crave my daily dose of nutrition every morning. It makes me feel like Im doing something great for my body, for my health. It has helped reduce my junk food cravings, and it has helped me change the way I eat because my body wants healthy foods now. I also use  Energy and Endurance  and  Results and Recovery  for my workouts, and I can say that both of these products have helped me dig deeper and push through the longer workouts when my body normally would say no more. I love that these all of these products are natural because I know Im doing something good for myself every time I use them. My body thanks me, too. Then came this  3-Day Refresh  program  holy canolis, batman!  What an amazing program! The first day was grueling, but as time passed, I felt healthier and lighter. It made me feel like my body was working to full capacity again. I will definitely be revisiting 3DR in the future.   Results vary based on starting point and effort.   You can change your life, too.

I felt I needed to make my 45th birthday a fitting tribute. It needed to celebrate our friendship. It needed to celebrate cycling, the sport Steve introduced me to thats completely reshaped my life. It needed to take a stand against the disease that robbed me of a few friends and familyand will not rob me of this one. And most of all, it needed to be really, bloody tough. Cuz thats how Steve would want it.   When my teammates learned about this, they quickly rose to the occasion, especially my training partner Kevin Nix, who designed our route.

Beachbody Results: Justin Lost 164 lbs. and Won $106,500!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/i-began-to-feel-unstoppable,"Meet Justin Wells, age 35 from Frenchburg, Kentucky. He lost 164lbs with Beachbodys system of fitness, nutrition, and support, and your votes  helped him win a total of $106,500 in the Beachbody Challenge !   Results achieved with  21 Day Fix ,  21 Day Fix Extreme , INSANITY MAX:30 , P90X3 , and  Shakeology . See his story       Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  I was disgusted by what I saw and full of self-loathing for letting myself get that badly overweight and out of shape. I knew that I was slowly killing myself with my terrible diet and lack of activity. I often isolated myself from others because I could never seem to shake the feeling that I was being judged every time I got around anyone else. It always seemed that all eyes were on me and my size. I hated the way I looked to the point that I felt things had become essentially hopeless for me to ever change anything about myself. Food was my only source of comfort more often than not, and I developed such a sense of shame that I continually went back to this comfort source. This cycle repeated itself so many times it was my crippling normal. I hoped things would get better, but I honestly did not hold out a great deal of hope that they would.   What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?   My sons birth was my main motivator to get me started. I teach parenting classes as part of my job, and I would tell everyone in the class how important a fathers example is in a childs life. In my own life, however, I was setting a terrible example. Not only was I on a course to likely deprive my son of a father at a young age, I was also set to teach him my terrible habits and potentially doom him to a similar life. Aside from all those factors, my son was looking at the prospect of having to sit on the sidelines and watch all the other children play with their fathers as I had to sit yet again due to exhaustion. Merely thinking of these factors drove me in the beginning, and as I went along I began to want to keep going for myself as well. I began to realize I deserved to feel better about myself, and frankly just to feel better overall. As more and more goals fell I began to feel unstoppable!   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  My greatest challenge was lack of discipline, which drove me to do the wrong things and avoid the right ones. I was, for lack of better terms, a food addict, and this addiction drove me to seek out foods that were fried, sugary, salty, and/or void of nutrition. I was also not disciplined enough to make exercise a part of my daily life. At 360 pounds, workouts are very difficult, and it takes a tremendous amount of fortitude to keep pushing play. I had great difficulty finding that fortitude at first. Beachbody and its programs have breathed a breath of refreshing hope into my lungs. As I began to eat better and build exercise programs into my life, my numbers on the scale began to get smaller and smaller. This motivated me to keep going and made me realize that if we keep doing the right things only good things will happen to us. I cannot help but feel that Beachbody helped me get my life back, and I cannot express my gratitude enough!     What in particular did you like about the program you chose?  I liked the portion control aspect as well as the structured workouts. I knew to a degree what to eat and what not to eat, but I was not always sure how much to eat or how to balance it. The  21 Day Fix  and  21 Day Fix EXTREME  eliminated the guesswork for me, and I now have so much more knowledge about how to fuel my body properly. I also had no idea how to structure an effective workout. I did not have a clue about how to warm up, which moves worked best in concert, and how to cool back down afterward. Shaun T and Autumn showed me the right way to exercise, and they also made it enjoyable enough that I would stick with it long-term. My old haphazard style of exercising has been replaced by effective workouts led by experts, and my colossal increase in results reflects that rather well.    Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  I have lost [over 160]pounds and likely over 100 inches, but just as importantly I feel as if I have altered my body composition in a pretty dramatic way. I would describe my appearance most of my adult life as being quite doughy. Now I am beginning to see more and more muscle definition. Much of my body fat aside from the last vestiges of stubborn belly fat is all but a thing of the past. I can now wear clothing sizes that once seemed impossible to ever see again. I wore 4X T-shirts much of my adult life, but now I can wear XL, and my jeans have gone from size 44 to size 34. My appearance has altered to the point that I recently stood across from my former neighbor of 22 years and she had no idea it was me! Besides the appearance factor, I am also proud that I can now exert myself without gasping for air. In the past most activities would leave me heavily winded, but now I have to work much harder to become out of breath. I have a long way to go yet, but I have come far!   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  My life has totally changed since I have made Beachbody a part of my life! I used to be consumed by a constant sense of pessimism and a focus on my limitations, but now I look at myself and my life and I see opportunity! I feel so much more confident about myself and my ability to accomplish personal goals than I once did. I have learned to not only set goals for myself, but set  big  goals for myself. I also feel like I have much more life ahead now, both in quantity and quality! At 360 pounds I knew I was facing a short life if nothing changed, but now I see no reason I cannot reach my 80s or beyond. My remaining years will also be more fruitful as I can engage in far more activities than I once thought possible. I feel like a vastly improved version of my former self, and I cannot imagine how great I will feel as I continue to follow Beachbodys amazing programs!   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  I felt as if the Group looked at me as an example of the good results that could be achieved over the long term, and I felt as if I would be letting them down if I faltered. Many of them had also met their personal goals, so I also drew inspiration from their awesome results!   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  He was there to answer any questions about nutrition (my main area of ignorance) and offer words of encouragement. He has been available any time I have needed his guidance, whether it was about nutrition, new programs to purchase, or anything else I needed to ask. He has probably received little compensation for all the work he has done for me, but he has done so with great kindness and respect, and I cannot thank him enough for that!

“I’m a Strong Mommy Ninja!”
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/strong-mommy-ninja,"Meet Jessica P, age 29 from Indian Land, SC.   She entered The Beachbody Challenge  and won $2,500!    Tell us about your life before you started the program. How did you feel about yourself and your body?  Before Beachbody I was out of shape from 2 C-Sections and losing my gallbladder and appendix in between. Before my babies, I was an obese wreck from years of toxic medications. I had illnesses that made losing weight impossible. Hashimotos Disease = Zero Metabolism. Chronic Fatigue Syndrome = Zero Energy. Fibromyalgia = Severe Pain. All of these illnesses occurred due to a miss-diagnosis of Primary Biliary Cirrhosis. I was only given 7 years to live. Not good news for a college athlete. During my organ removal a biopsy showed no PBC but now Fatty Liver Disease. From a suggested lack of activity and poor nutrition due to financial hardships. I gained 120 Pounds in my 20s. I was embarrassed and had anxiety attacks if I saw anyone from my Athletic Past. I feared stairs especially with kids in my arms. I needed a miracle. As soon as I was cleared for exercise knowing I had no expiration date I turned to Beachbody Programs, Shakeology, and my Coach Brianne for help.    What inspired you to change your life and begin your transformation journey?  My children are my world. They deserve a Mom who can pass on the Athletic Skills she poses. I want to play at their park as if it were my own. Without fear of busting their equipment. I made a promise to my family that I wouldnt just sit and feed the birds. I want their joys to be filled with happy memories of a fun and athletic mommy enjoying life along their sides. Also, I had some serious rage from the injustices my body has endured through the past decade. I needed to channel the negative energy into erasing the damage. I changed my diet, started pressing play daily, drank Shakeology for breakfast, and instead of a being a spectator I joined the party.   What is the greatest challenge you faced before beginning the program? How did the program and Beachbody help you overcome that challenge?  I was starting from the bottom and couldnt see the top. I knew I just had to tap into my athlete and just get it done but I was guilty about stealing an hour away from my babies. It hurt my soul. I knew every time I trained I was gaining life to live with them so I did it for our future. I was a skeptic. I tried numerous things that only provided short term results and now was not the time to fail. My mission was finding myself and then making improvements. I did not want to lose the game. This was my time. The programs I followed helped me find my fitness again and aided my diet and nutrition. I no longer fear stairs.   Describe the results you achieved with your Beachbody program. Which achievements are you proud of?  60 Pounds + 65 Inches in 4 Months!Im so proud that Slim in 6 + Keep it up, Slim Series + S.S Express destroyed 2 years of pregnancy gain. It helped me address my medical issues so much sooner. Thanks Debbie Siebers!I then lost22 Pounds + 29 Inches in 2 Months.My metabolism shot through the roof. Im so proud this program put my hormones back in balance.Later, I lost28 Pounds + 46 Inches in 4 Months. Muscles do burn fat ! My Total Results. 110 Pounds + 140 Inches in 10 Months! Ive lost 18.5 off my Chest, 20 off my Waist, 20 off my Hips, and 25 off my Thighs! Ive lost 21% Body Fat and 20.1 BMI. Jean size was 22/24 now 8/10. T-shirt size was 2xl now medium. Thanks Beachbody   How has your life changed since completing your Beachbody program?  Im no longer wearing pregnancy clothing. No more huge elastic waste bands. No more bras with adjustable straps. I can fit into normal clothing from a regular clothing store. No more special ordering bras from risky websites. I no longer cry trying things on because I know they wont fit or the store doesnt carry my size. Beachbody has completely changed my life in every way imaginable. I can recognize myself in the mirror again; there isnt a stranger looking back at me. I love taking my sweaty selfies during my fitness challenges now. I used to dread them. I can do push ups with my 2 year old on my back. Like real push ups not girl push ups. I could probably knock your lights out if I had to defend myself  hehe. And the air I can catch with jumping moves  whoa. 100 pounds lost never to be found again. There is no part of me that hasnt completely transformed. And I love it. I love m e My legs dont have fatigue + pain. My back pain has dwindled. Im not scared of stairs and I no longer have panic attacks. I no longer have hypothyroidism or fatty liver disease. I harbor zero negative energy. I can play with my babies using their equipment.  Im a Strong Mommy Ninja!  Im a complete overhaul. Thanks again Beachbody!!   How did participating in a Challenge Group help you reach your goals? How did your group support you and keep you accountable?  Participating in a Challenge Group helped me reach my goal because these ladies are in the same boat as me. Struggling mothers trying to fit everyone elses busy day into their schedules while trying to better ourselves. The support was fantastic. Ive made life long friends and we are challenging each other in every aspect of life. Just logging on everyday to track food, water, exercise, etc. was enough to keep us accountable and allowed us all to see great results.   How did your Team Beachbody Coach support you on your journey?  My Coach helped keep me accountable also made suggestions I wouldnt have thought of to keep me motivated. She shared her journey which inspired me to keep pushing play. Knowing that I wasnt the only one feeling the way I felt and how she was able to turn things around helped me realize it is possible to focus on me, and not feel guilty about taking time away from the family to be able to put fitness and health back into my life. And make me a priority right alongside everyone else. Thanks Coach Brianne!   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program (such as Shakeology or Beachbody Ultimate Reset) support your transformation? What are the greatest benefits you gained? Did you see benefits to your energy, sleep, mood/mental clarity, digestion/regularity?   Shakeology  has healed me from within. Feeding my body what it needed with superfoods gave me energy for my workouts. My hair and nails feel strong and healthy. My skin is glowing and it isnt from pregnancy or childbirth. My Mommy brain fog has lifted and instead of feeling like Im 2 steps behind trying to catch up, Im always 1 step ahead. It tastes great and is a very versatile product. I also use the  3-Day Refresh . It opened my eyes to what a fruit and veggie portion looks like, and helped me realize if Im ever hungry I can always turn to a low calorie healthy snacks, feel full, and not give into temptations.   How did a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program affect any existing health conditions you have?  I no longer have hypothyroidism and have been taken off medications completely. My liver test results show that I am within normal ranges which means I no longer have fatty liver disease. My skin is so healthy. My hair is growing like weeds. My nails are strong. My immune system is strong. My digestion is strong. I am strong. Completely different body inside and out. I have never felt as good as I do today. Shakeology is not only the boost of energy I needed to really make me push hard, it has also healed me from deep within. I am a complete transformation.  Mind, body + soul.   Did you achieve any other measurable improvements with a Beachbody Supplement or Nutritional Product or Program? (e.g. Blood Pressure, Blood Sugar, triglycerides, etc)  Ive seen such great results that my doctor said Im now one of her healthiest patients. The opposite from 10 months ago. She is so proud of me she asked for a picture of me tackling the Warrior Dash to post in her office. To help inspire and motivate her other clients! The Beachbody Programs, Shakeology, my Coach Brianne, and Primary Care Physician Dr. Wilson all helped save my life. I shed 110 Pounds + 140 Inches in 10 Months from my Skeleton. Thanks everyone!  Happy Mothers Day!     You can change your life, too. Take the  Beachbody Challenge  for the tools you need to Decide, Commit, and Succeed!

Ask the Expert: Are Cheat Meals OK?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/ask-expert-cheat-meals-ok,"The Short Answer:   Its absolutely OK to have a cheat meal! If the rest of your diet plan is tight, theres nothing wrong with cutting loose once or twice a week. In fact, the shift in calories may help you avoid plateaus. Also, it keeps you sane. After all, life is too short not to eat the occasional donut.   The Long Answer:   Now that youve stopped twerking for joy around the room and returned to your screen, Ill explain why the occasional cheat meal is OK. As I said, they are a good way to ward off potential plateaus. They also break up the stress commonlyassociated with a diet and keep you on track.   Cheat meals fight plateaus.  While we live in a modern world, our bodies still operate under some very primitive rules. When you eat at a calorie deficit while working out regularly, your body doesnt get the memo that you could stop at any time. Instead, it assumes youre trudging across a desolate African plain with nary a Souplantation in sight, desperately tracking a wildebeest in hopes of feeding your starving family. (Some might argue that  Plyo X  offers a similar sensation.)   To deal with this stress, your body will sometimes slow down its metabolism and hold on to emergency fuel stores (body fat) to survive. We call this starvation mode and because youre not burning fat, it creates a weight-loss plateau. While the obvious solution is to increase your calories in general, cheat meals are also effective because they give your body a little feast break in the middle of the famine to convince it to keep burning those love handles away.   In fact, we often suggest people zigzag their calories from a large deficit to a slight surplus over the course of a week to break this type of plateau. A cheat meal or two, provided the rest of your eating is extremely clean, can create such a zigzag.   Cheat meals strengthen willpower.  In their excellent book  Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength , Dr. Roy Baumeister and science writer John Tierney discuss the concept of decision fatigue, the idea that willpower, just like our muscles, can give out after a while. When asked whether making decisions would deplete their willpower and make them vulnerable to temptation, most people say no. They dont realize that decision fatigue helps explain why ordinary, sensible people get angry at their colleagues and family, splurge on clothes, buy junk food at the supermarket, and cant resist the car dealers offer to rustproof their new sedan.   Think of cheat meals the same way you think of recovery days. They give your willpower a chance to rest and restore, reducing the chance that youll fall off the wagon in a bigger way.   Cheat meals relieve stress.  Survival mode suggests cheat meals relieve physical stress. Decision fatigue suggests they relieve mental stress. Theres also a third type of stress they relieve: emotional stress. Turning around your diet can be really hard. Sometimes, eating clean means youre walking away from foods youve looked to your whole life for comfort, nourishment, celebration, and security. The fact that they are absolute crap and they were slowly killing you is beside the point. They still have an enormous amount of emotional resonance. As long as you dont think itll cause a relapse, theres no reason to completely walk away from cake on your birthday or a hot dog at the baseball game. Whenever Im visiting my parents in Atlanta, you better believe I help myself to my moms epic banana cream pie. In fact, only having it on special occasions makes it all the more delicious.   What if I dont want a cheat meal?   Although Ive put forth some compelling arguments for a cheat meal, I dont want to strong-arm you into succumbing to temptation. If youre keeping it 100% clean and that works for you, go for it. For some people cold turkey is the only way to avoid stumbling into bad habits.   On a semi-side note, a funny thing happens when you eat healthy for a while. Your idea of a cheat meal redefines itself. As a teenager, I could polish off a large meat lovers pizza and two liters of Coke. Today, two slices of veggie pizza, a huge salad, and a 12-ounce craft beer is my idea of indulgence. As for my moms banana cream pie, anything more than a medium-sized slice and I get ill. (You dont want to know how much of it I used to eat.)   As you enjoy your cheat meals, pay attention to how your body reacts. When abused, refined sugar is toxic, but most Americans have built up a tolerance. They cant feel how it tears them apart, spiking blood sugar and torquing their hormones. When you dont normally consume it in excess, occasional consumption can make you feel sick. Thats your body telling you to eat less next time.   Finally, a couple of cheat meal myths.   Some experts claim that binging on a cheat meal to the point of illness is a good thing because it keeps you on the straight and narrow for the rest of the week. This is stupid advice given by fools who dont understand the brief gorging refractory period involved with being a chronic overeater. If a meal makes you sick, youve poisoned yourselfnot something you want to do on a regular basis.   Lastly, if someone suggests post-cheat meal tricks to mitigate the damage, dont bother. Its too late. A glass of lemon water or a series of antiquated calisthenics will be about as effective as trying to pop the Goodyear Blimp with a toothpick.   So if you think its right for you, go ahead and have a cheat meal. Anticipate it before you eat it, enjoy it while its happening, and own it once its done. Then get back on your horse in the morning."

Transformation Tuesday: Kristen Lost 23 Pounds with ASYLUM!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-kristen-lost-23-pounds-asylum,"KristenK. has a very busy life, and was excited by the idea of INSANITY: THE ASYLUM , a program so tough her coach said people could barely even finish it.She finished ittwice! She lost 23 pounds and 20 inches over two rounds ofASYLUM. Heres her story, in her own words:   I have a 2 year old son and a 9 month old daughter so my life is very busy. I had been a coach for 2 years and decided after the birth of my daughter I needed to get in shape again. I was told I had to wait 6 weeks before doing any workout program since I had a c-section. Itwas very hard for me to look in the mirror and see the extra weight that I had gained, but I knew with motivation and determination through Beachbody I would be able to achieve my goals.   In two years I had two surgeries and I was told multiple times to rest and wait on any workout program. I wanted to change my lifestyle and when I was given the go-aheadto start working out, I was beyond ready.   Getting up and pushing play was the hardest since sleep was lacking with a baby, but after I started to see results in the mirror and my clothes were fitting again it became easier. It took a year to lose the weight aftermy first child, but my eating plans and workout challenges made this weight loss easier!   I was given INSANITY: ASYLUM Vol.1 by my coach and was told, Here, try this 30 day challenge. Just to let you know,most dont finish the program. Well, I was going to show my coach- I was going to finish this challenge, and I did! I loved it, so I purchased INSANITY: ASYLUM Vol. 2! I love having a schedule to follow and needed to start something new since I was in this workout routine. My husband, who is in great shape, started working out with me at 5:15 AM everyday because he could see the difference in how I felt and looked!   This is a fast-paced challenge. I love the way you feel after working out and the sweat dripping off your face knowing Wow, did I just do that! The name INSANITY comes not from being able to do the insane moves, but from how it takes over your body and mind and makes you want to workout!   I love my stomach! I had a baby 9 months ago via c-section, and look at my definition and without doing hundreds of sit-ups daily. My arms show that multiple push-ups pay off. Who knew that push-ups would be the easiest part of the program?   I have confidence in myself now. I feel as though I can take on a challenge and actually complete it. The results are rewarding. When others ask mehow Ilost the weight so fast I reply, Beachbody and determination. I post pictures of my journey on my Facebook page and when the family goes out, people come up to me and say, I have been following you and you are a big motivation for me! My husband replied, I didnt realize you had so many fans. This makes me feel good, knowing I am helping others too.         You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge , for the ultimate motivation to get fit! Select any Beachbody program and once you complete it, share your results for your chance to win cash and prizes."

Transformation Tuesday: Ann Lost 67 Pounds with INSANITY
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday,"Check out Anns amazing INSANITY  transformation! In three rounds, she lost 67 pounds and 37.5 inches! What an accomplishment! Check out her story in her own words:   I gained 70 lbs duringmy 3rd pregnancy, and I was put on bed rests at 27 weeks and had torefrain from any physical activity. After giving birth I felt weak, tired all the time, and didnt feel good inside and out.  I was not myself!  I was struggling just to get up a flight of stairs. After I had my complete physical my cholesterol was out of control and my blood pressure increased significantly. Having family history of Coronary Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) and High Blood Pressure and my doctor recommended I take cholesterol medication to control it. As a nurse I refused (medical people are the worst patients)- I wanted to work on my health my own way, the natural way.   As a nurse I felt its my job to inspire my patients as well as others to live a healthy lifestyle. I felt like  I couldnt teach my patients healthy lifestyle if I couldnt do it myself . I wanted to lead by example and be able to run around and play with my kids. Im always up for a good challenge, but mostly I wanted to do it for myself. I wanted to be a good example for my kids and wanted to be around long enough to see them grow. I also wanted to feel great again, feel the energy and live actively. I must say that watching the Team Beachbody infomercials inspired me, the success stories and before and after photos are amazing and I said to myself, If they can do it, I can do it.   Isaw an infomercial for INSANITY. I thought to myself, My goodness that looks like a challenge. I wonder if I can do that? The funny part is, I wanted to do it because  I wanted to earn the T-shirt that says I earned it.  To me, that was the trophy I could show around. And I knew I was going to be up for a challenge. After I purchased the program I met my coach, and she definitely helped me. Hearing about her own success story and seeing how amazing she looks now just motivated me even more.   I like INSANITY for the cardio, and it challenges me to push myself. I dont get bored. Its the combination of cardio and core exercise that I like, and  it targets all muscle groups with no equipment required . When I first started even if I could finish just half the workout, you know Igot my workout by how much Isweat and how intense Ifelt.   I no longer shop in Plus size anymore! I used to be a 1X and now I shop in the junior sections! I am proud that I am able to do the extreme workout and from zero push ups I can now do all sorts of push ups. I loved the program so much that I became INSANITY certified this year andamproud to teach the program and help people. I definitely feel more alive!  I have a lot of energy and I look forward everyday to my different workout programs. Since completing the program and asan instructor  I can use my own success story to help other people . Its great to see more and more people coming in on a regular basis and knowing that people are willing to travel a little bit more just to take my class is very rewarding.   Taking the Beachbody Challenge was the best decision Ive made for myself . Seeing the before and after results motivated me. Seeing people posting their workout, food and the support you get from everyone definitely helped me push through. I have  Shakeology  for dinner every night and I absolutely love it! I feel good and not hungry and I feel more energized. I am a chocolate person, so I look at difference ways to make the Chocolate Shakeology dessert is a plus for me. Now, I am proud to say that my cholesterol levels are normal!From 254 HDL to 124  thats quite an accomplishment and without medication is aplus!         You can change your life too.

Transformation Tuesday: Ashley Lost 34 Pounds with PiYo and FOCUS T25!
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/success-stories/transformation-tuesday-ashley-lost-34-pounds-piyo-focus-t25,"Ashley was a new mom who had just given birth to her third child. When she found the weight was not dropping off as easily as it had with her first two children, she found PiYo and FOCUS T25 to help her get back in shape. In 4 months, she lost 34 lbs and 25 inches! Read her story in her own words, below:   In November 2013, I gave birth to my thirdbaby. After my first two pregnancies, the pregnancy weight quickly fell off. Once I had given birth to my third, I realized the weight was not going anywhere. I developed poor eating habits during pregnancy (eating for two, right?!) and they continued after his birth. I was tired not just new mom tired, but completely exhausted. I had promised my older two children that after the baby was born, I would have more energy and be able to play like I had before, but I couldnt. There was so much guilt. Guilt for letting myself get to this point, for letting my children down, for setting a poor example for them.   I reluctantly borrowed some size 16 pants from a friend because I refused to buy a larger size when I had a closet full of size 10 clothes that I would eventually fit into right? Wrong. The pants fit. It was a sad realization for me of how much I needed this change. I decided to fully commit to transforming my life .   I began with PiYo. I stuck to the workout schedule and the nutrition guide. I lost 6 lbs my first week! I lost weight every week after. More than that, I lost inches week after week. Once I had completed PiYo, I started Focus T25. Every week, I kept expecting to see that weight loss plateau but it didnt! I just kept losing and I kept getting stronger. My diet did a complete 180. I am eating clean and being an example for my children. Theyre even starting to eat the vegetables without too many complaints! Through eating clean, drinking Shakeology , and daily exercise, I have all of the energy I had hoped for, that I was certain I would never have again! I thought I might never be myself again before I started with Beachbody, but I finally feel like I am back to the person I was long ago !   I can keep up with my kids and I am not begging for daily naps. My strength, flexibility, and endurance have improved drastically. In total, I have lost 34 lbs (20 lbs with PiYo and an additional 14 lbs with T25) and 25 inches! Losing 6 inches in your waist and 7 inches in your hips is shocking! I dropped from those size 16 pants all the way down to a size 8! I feel amazing. I can be the mom I promised my children I would be . I am committed to a healthy lifestyle and I am ready to tackle the next challenge!   You can change your life, too. Take the Beachbody Challenge , for the ultimate motivation to get fit!

3 Tips to Stay Committed to Your Goals
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/motivation/3-tips-stay-committed-goals,"Have you heard the one about the chicken and pig who want to make a bacon-and-egg sandwich for the farmer they liked so much? The chicken says, I could provide some eggs. The pig replies, Thats fine, but while youre making a contribution, Im making a real commitment!   The same adage holds true to anyone trying to get in (and stay in) shape. If you simply get involved in your nutrition and fitness plan, and contribute some time and effort toward living healthy, you will most likely achieve some results. You may feel stronger, more confident, and pleased with your progress. However, these feelings wont compare to the satisfaction youll experience if you are 100% committed to each training session and meal.   Committing wholeheartedly to your health is not easy. There will be times when youll experience temporary physical, psychological, or emotional discomfort. You may feel torn between ordering that 350-calorie blended coffee drink or unsweetened peppermint tea. You may be hesitant to attempt more pull-ups today than you did last week for fear of failing. We all struggle to eat healthy when you have a late night craving (trust me, Ive been there). In these moments of weakness, its only natural to want to waver on your commitment to the goals you set. But committing to your plan makes it possible to admire yourself both inside and out. Youll stand more confidently. Youll feel sexier. Youll discover your true sense of well-being, purpose, and personal worth. Youll feel grounded, energized, and intact. Youll simply be happier in mind, body, and spirit.   Here are three ways to help you stay committed to achieving your goals that can help you stay strong when youre struggling:      1.  Post your goals on your bathroom mirror.  Posting your short-term daily goals in a place where you automatically see them each day will help you to stay focused, motivated, and committed to staying on task. Your bathroom mirror is the perfect place because youll see your goals first thing in the morning and right before you go to sleep at night. For greater results, also post your primary purpose for setting your goals (e.g., wanting to have more energy to play with your kids, to go on an adventure trip, to live longer, to feel more confident, etc.).      2.  Prepare daily for what-ifs.  Before your day begins, ask yourself if there are any challenges that may interfere with your daily goals. For example, what if you get called in to a last-minute lunch meeting? What if your child asks you to play during the time you blocked off for training? What if youre going out to celebrate a friends birthday? For each what-if make a plan to cope with the challenge while still staying committed to your fitness and nutrition. Of course, there are plenty of uncontrollable distractions, but strategizing on how to cope with your most common challenges will set you up to deal with anything that happens during you day.      3.  Journal your daily effort .  There is no doubt that tracking your nutrition and fitness improves your chances of achieving your goals. But I recommend also keeping a diary in which you answer the following question each day:  Did I exert every ounce of effort to achieving my goals today?  If your answer is yes, great! If your answer is no, write down one thing you can do tomorrow to be better than you were today.   When you follow these three tips, your level of commitment for fitness and nutrition will skyrocket, giving you the best shot at achieving your goals and feeling ultimate satisfaction. Better yet, when these three tips become part of your daily ritual, not only will you achieve your goals, but get results that will last!      What are your tips and tricks to staying committed to reaching your goals?"

39 Great Supermarket Foods
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/great-supermarket-foods,"Rule #13: Shop the Periphery of the Supermarket and Stay Out of the Middle.Michael Pollan,Food Rules   Shopping for ingredients can be daunting. Even if you take noted nutrition writer Michael Pollans advice and stick to the perimeter of the store, where you can gather your fresh produce, dairy products, and meat (or better yet, shop at a farmers market), what about when you need to venture into the center aisles, where youll find packaged and processed goods for, say, condiments or chicken broth? Which deli meat is nitrite free? Which veggie burgers arent chock full of filler?   Some of the food products out there are downright scary, so to help you navigate the grocery store minefielddangerous territory that extends to the deli section and the dairywe sent our intrepid reporters to examine the many brands out there, in hopes of finding the best food products* available at most supermarkets or online. An interesting discovery during our investigation: Not all food products created by the same brand earned our thumbs up. Some were okay, others were not. These suggestions are not exhaustivethere are a lot of great products out there. If you cant find the products we mention below, read the label first.  Not sure if a product is ok? Ask us in the comments below.   Before your next trip to the supermarket, print out the list at the end of this article and bring it with you. Youll save time and avoid the weird stuff.      CONDIMENTS & SPREADS   Ketchup  Ketchup, while delicious, is not the best condiment for you. By nature, it contains a sweetenerwhether thats sugar, cane syrup, or (gasp) high fructose corn syrup.   Our Pick: Whole Foods 365 Organic Tomato Ketchup ($1.99/24 oz.)  The Whole Foods brand of ketchup contains only the ingredients ketchup needs to be ketchuptomato puree, evaporated cane juice, white vinegar, salt, onion powder, and spices. If you dont have a Whole Foods nearby, Heinzs Simply Heinz is the next best option, as it contains sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup. The best way to know exactly what is in your ketchup is to make your own. Try this easy  homemade ketchup recipe .     Mustard  Mustard is an almost calorie-free way to give a flavor boost to sauces and proteins. But some mustards also include natural flavors. And because natural flavors are not always natural, 1 , 2 were going with the one that doesnt have them.   Our Pick: Morehouse Yellow Mustard ($2.49/20 oz.)  Morehouses Yellow Mustard contains only distilled vinegar, mustard seed, sea salt, turmeric, paprika, and spices. Were okay with spices being left a mystery because food labeling laws require these ingredients to be from this list of seasonings . 3   Mayonnaise  Real mayonnaise is made from eggs, oil, and sometimes lemon juice or vinegar. Most store brands stray pretty far from this recipe. Miracle Whip adds high fructose corn syrup, natural flavor, and potassium sorbate (a synthetic preservative that is also used in industrial coatings 4 ). Best Foods/Hellmanns adds calcium sodium EDTA.   Our Pick: Spectrum Organic Mayonnaise ($3.99/11.25 oz.)  Spectrum makes several mayonnaises that meet our high standard. All of the ingredients are organic and are actually food.   Hot Sauce  Hot sauce adds flavor, but can also add unnecessary sugar or sodium.   Our Pick: Tabasco Pepper Sauce ($2.49/2 oz.)  It doesnt take a lot of ingredients to turn up the heat. Classic Tabasco only has three ingredients: red peppers, salt, and distilled vinegar. Many Mexican hot sauces come in a healthy(ish) second. All you need to do is read the ingredients list.   Soy Sauce  Theres no getting around the fact that soy sauce is loaded with sodium. But, grab a random bottle from the shelf and it might also include modified food starch or sugar.   Our Pick: Kikkoman Low-Sodium Soy Sauce ($3.49/10 oz.)  This soy sauce is tasty, though dont mistake it for a low-sodium food! We dont love that it includes sodium benzoate and lactic acid, but weve seen worse. If you have a Trader Joes nearby, theirs is best as it contains only water, soybeans, wheat, and salt. Plus, it has 460mg of sodium (vs. Kikkomans 575 mg).   Peanut Butter  Peanut butter thats perfectly smooth and spreadable (even the crunchy kind) is made with added hydrogenated vegetable oil or palm oil (and usually a ton of sugar). Dont want to stir your all-natural peanut butter every time you eat it? We dont either. Stir it once, and then store it in your fridge.   Our Pick: Laura Scudders All-Natural Peanut Butter ($3.29/16 oz.)  Laura Scudders All-Natural Peanut Butter contains only peanuts and touch of salt. It is also available in organic and unsalted varieties.     Jam  The jam, jelly, and fruit preserves aisle is full of trouble. Reach willy-nilly for any jam jar on the shelf and you might be picking up a jar of fruit laced with high fructose corn syrup, tons of added sugar, aspartame, and Red 40.   Our Pick: St. Dalfour ($3.99/10 oz.)  St. Dalfour is pure, old-fashioned fruit spread: fruit, fruit juice, and pectin (a natural thickener). A widely available alternative, Bonne Maman Fruit Preserves ($4.99/13 oz.), gets high marks from us for its real fruit flavor and similarly simple recipe (they sweeten with sugar instead of juice).   Salad Dressing  The best way to have healthy salad dressing is to make it from scratch. Otherwise you risk ingesting a wide range of nasty stuff like corn syrup, artificial colors, and phosphoric acida tangy-tasting corrosive chemical. 5 We found all of these ingredients in Kraft Free Caesar Italian).   Our Pick: Annies Naturals Balsamic Vinaigrette ($3.99/8 oz.)  Annies Naturals uses common, known ingredients: water, oil, vinegar, honey, mustard, and salt.      DAIRY & NON-DAIRY   Greek Yogurt  Greek yogurts are made from the same stuff as regular yogurt, are strained to achieve a thicker consistency, and contain more protein. For the most part, they all get our stamp of approval.   Our Picks: Fage Total 0% Plain ($6.99/32 oz.) or Chobani Nonfat Plain ($6.49/32 oz.)  The key is to buy plain Greek yogurt and add your own fresh fruit or honey. Heres why. In those little pre-flavored cups, theres a lot of added sugar. 8 ounces of plain nonfat Fage has 100 calories, 23 g of protein, and 6 g of sugar (from the milk). One 5.3-oz. container of Blueberry Fage has 120 calories, 13 g of protein, and 16 g of sugar (from the milk, blueberries, and added sugar). Eating more yogurt and consuming more protein, fewer calories, and less sugar sounds good to us.     Regular Yogurt  Once again, plain is best. The flavored yogurts we inspected contained a lot more than the fruits showcased on the labels. Light yogurts were even worse with ingredient labels that listed aspartame, gelatin, and modified cornstarch.   Our Pick: DANNON all-natural plain nonfat yogurt ($4.19/32 oz.)  DANNON plain nonfat yogurt contains 100 calories and 11 grams of protein per cup. The only ingredients? Cultured Grade A nonfat milk, live active cultures (L. bulgaricus, S. thermophilus, L. acidophilus, bifidus, L. caseithe bacteria strains that make yogurt yogurt), and pectin (a thickener made from fruit).   A side note: Though we mostly recommend the low-fat and nonfat dairy products in our guides and recipes, its OKAY to eat full-fat dairy products. Theyre less processed than their nonfat cousins.   Cottage Cheese  Nearly every Beachbody program nutrition guide includes cottage cheese, because it is a low-calorie, protein-rich, versatile anytime snack. But some brands of low-fat cottage cheese also contain suspect ingredients like modified food starch, mono- and diglycerides, and artificial color.   Our Pick: Daisy Low-fat Cottage Cheese ($3.29/16 oz.)  Daisy Low-fat Cottage Cheese contains only milk, cream, salt, and vitamin A palmitate (a plant-based source of vitamin A added to replace the nutrients lost when fat is removed). Want to avoid the palmitate? Eat the full-fat version.   Cream Cheese  Spreadable cream cheese packs big flavor and protein in just a tablespoon or two. But some brands, like Weight Watchers, contain extra ingredients like maltodextrin and inulin (a sweetener). Flavored cream cheeses often contain artificial flavors and colors.   Our Pick: Organic Valley ($4.29/8 oz.)  Organic is always best, especially when it comes to dairy. Organic Valley cream cheese is made from organic milk, organic cream, organic lactose powder, salt, and organic locust bean guma natural thickener made from carob seeds. 6 If you cant spring for organic, we also recommend Philadelphia Original Cream Cheese ($2.29/8 oz.).   Half and Half  Technically, half and half is a blend of cream and milk, but many brands add color, preservatives, corn syrup, and mono- and diglycerides. Fat-free versions replace cream with fillers, emulsifiers, and chemicals.   Our Pick: Horizon Organic Half & Half ($2.99/pint)  Horizon Organic Half & Half contains only organic Grade A whole milk and organic cream. If you have a hankering for flavors, try adding a few drops of all-natural vanilla, rum, or hazelnut extract instead of flavored creamers.     Soy Milk  Ever looked at the ingredient list on non-dairy milk? Theres a lot there that might cause your eyebrow (and your blood sugar) to rise, including all kinds of sugars and preservatives.   Our Pick: Organic Edensoy ($2.39/32 oz)  Organic Unsweetened Edensoy contains two ingredients: water and organic soybeans. Plus, it has 12 grams of protein and only 5 mg of sodium per 8-oz. serving (compared to 7 g and 70 mg in Silk).   Almond Milk  With just 30 calories per serving, almond milk has one-third the calories of nonfat milk. Made from scratch, it contains only almonds and water, but some brands recipes include a long list of other ingredients, including sugars.   Our Pick: Pacific Almond Milk ($2.99/32 oz.)  This almond milk contains almonds, sea salt, vanilla, rice starch, carrageenan (from seaweed), and natural flavors. Plus, its fortified with the same nutrients as milk. Welltake it.   Rice Milk  Rice milk is a simple beverage at its core. Thats why we were surprised to see so many extra ingredients and sweeteners in some brands. However, unlike other milk alternatives, rice milk has low nutritional value and provides very little protein. It is not our first choice for your balanced diet.   Our Pick: Rice Dream ($1.69/32 oz.)  Rice Dream has a handful of ingredients (water, brown rice, expeller pressed high oleic safflower oil, and sea salt), and we like that its made from brown rice.      BREAD PRODUCTS   Bread  Manythough not allbreads that claim to be whole-grain contain processed flours, sugars, and dough conditioners, and that is just the beginning.   Our Pick: Food for Life 7 Sprouted Grains Bread ($3.49/24 oz.)  Why? Whats in it: brown rice, whole sprouted grains and lentils, wheat gluten, and sea salt. Everything is organic, and each slice has 80 calories, 3 g of fiber, 4 g of protein, and 0.5 g of fat. They also offer a gluten-free version. Another option? Freshly baked, whole-grain bread from your local bakery.   English Muffins  Thomas whole wheat English muffins contain preservatives, artificial color, and a host of chemicals including azodicarbonamide, a bleaching agent that is used in plastics and which is banned for food use inof all placesEngland!   Our Pick: Food for Life 7 Sprouted Grains English Muffins ($4.59/6 muffins)  Like their bread, Food for Lifes English muffins contain only organic sprouted grains, yeast, gluten, and salt. Half of one muffin has 80 calories, 4 g of protein, and 3 g of fiber.     Whole-Grain Tortillas  Many whole-grain tortillas, like Mission multi-grain flour tortillas, look deceptively healthy, but are made with evil hydrogenated oils, sugar, preservatives, and chemical dough conditioners.   Our Pick: Food for Life Ezekiel 4:9  Taco Size Whole-Grain Tortillas  Food for Lifes tortillas are made from organic sprouted grains, seeds, lentils, water, sea salt, and nothing else. Their ideal size (80 calories, 3 g protein, and 2 g fiber) and clean ingredients list make them the healthiest choice for wraps and personal pizzas.   Hamburger Buns  Every hamburger bun we inspected contained a long list of undesirable ingredients like ethoxylated diglycerides, high fructose corn syrup, and chemical dough conditioners.   Our Pick: Food for Life Sprouted Whole-Grain Burger Buns  Food for Life is the clear winner of the bread category. Their buns are made from organic sprouted 100% whole wheat and 100% whole wheat flour (always look for the 100%). Or you can use freshly baked bread. Just check the ingredients before you purchase.   Cereal  We picked up nearly every box in the cereal aisle, reaching instinctively for cereals we thought were made with basic ingredientsthey werentand ogling the crazy ingredient lists on some: brown rice syrup, cane syrup, high fructose corn syrup, preservatives, fillers, artificial colors, coatings, refined flours.   Our Pick: Engine 2 Rips Big Bowl ($4.99/13-oz. box)  This was our greatest find of the day. After giving up hope that an ideal breakfast cereal existed, we found this little red box and snatched one for further research. Its hearty whole and sprouted grains and flakes did not disappoint. Their Triple Berry Walnut cereal contains real fruit (actual strawberries and blackberries!) that provides a hint of sweetness. There are no added sweeteners of any kind. They have a diet plan that we dont necessarily endorse for everyone, but we cant say enough good things about their cereal.   Frozen Waffles  When it comes to frozen waffles, were not touching the highly processed yellow variety (seriously, they add artificial yellow color). But even some whole-grain waffles can add sugar and preservatives to your most important meal of the day.   Our Pick: Kashi 7-Grain Waffles ($3.49/8 waffles)  We chose these because, while they do contain sugar from cane juice and molasses, two of their whole-grain waffles have more protein (4 g) and fiber (7 g) than other brands. Serve with fruit instead of syrup.   Pancake Mix  Tony Horton likens pancakes to eating birthday cake for breakfast. And its no wonder why. Original Bisquick is made from processed flour and partially hydrogenated oils. Top that with butter and maple syrup and youre on your way to fewer birthday cakes in the long run.   Our Pick: Baker Mills Kodiak Cakes ($5.99/24 oz.)  We were impressed by the 100% whole-grain flour, 7 g of protein, and 4 g of fiber per serving of Baker Mills Kodiak Cakes mix. Sweetened only with honey, it contains no preservatives or industrial sweeteners.      PROTEINS   Prepackaged Deli Turkey or Ham  Luncheon meats can be scary territory in the grocery store. What looks like sliced turkey breast is often poultry pieces that have been ground into a paste, processed with chemical binders and nitrites, flavored with corn syrup and artificial flavors, and molded into a cylinder, then sliced. Ew. Whats the big deal about nitrites and why do we suggest all your meats be nitrite-free? Because nitrates and nitrites have been linked to increased risk of cancer, 7  heart disease, and diabetes. 8   Our Pick: Applegate Farms  Applegates packaged deli products are made from cage-free animals that were never treated with hormones or antibiotics. Their meats have no nitrites or fillers and stick to the basicssliced protein, water, salt, and carrageenan obtained from seaweed.     Vegetarian Burgers  A vegetarian diet is supposed to be good for you. Which is why some of the ingredients in veggie burgers were so shocking. Artificial flavor? Modified vegetable gum? Natural butter flavor?   Our Pick: Asherahs Gourmet Vegan Burgers ($4.99/4 burgers)  Made from organic quinoa, organic sweet potatoesorganic everything down to the spices. Each patty has 180 calories, 190 mg of sodium, 30 g of carbs, 5 g of fat, and 6 g of protein. Our second choice, Original Sunshine Burgers, are also packed with organic goodness. These are made from sunflower seeds, so each burger is higher in fat and calories, but provides double the protein (350 calories, 21 g of fat, 12 g of protein).   Hot Dogs  Hot dogs are famously made from mystery meat. This takes on new meaning now that the world has been introduced to the horrors of pink slime and horsemeat. Then there are all the artificial flavors, preservatives, sodium, chemical fillers, and corn syrup.   Our Pick: Applegate Great Organic Beef Hot Dogs ($4.99/8 franks)  Applegate Farms links contain only organic grass-fed beef and organic spices. At 110 calories per link, 8 g of fat, and 330 mg of sodiumand the knowledge that their animals are cage- and crate-freewhen it comes to hot dogs, these are a good choice.      DIPS, SAUCES, & SOUP   Hummus  Hummus is easy to make and we recommend that. Heres oneyou can try . But if youre going to buy prepared hummus, selecting one that is close to how you would make it from scratch is best.   Our Pick: Haigs Hummus ($3.79/8 oz.)  Haigs original hummus contains garbanzo beans, tahini, lemon juice, water, garlic, spices, and salt. With four flavors to choose from, you wont get bored.   Applesauce  Applesauce is a tasty way to add fruit to your diet, as long as its all-natural. Motts and Musselmans add high fructose corn syrup and/or sugar to some of their applesauces.   Our Pick: Santa Cruz Organic Applesauce ($3.89/23 oz.)  Apples are one the most insecticide-treated fruits, so youll definitely want to buy organic. Santa Cruz Organic Applesauce contains only organic apples and vitamin C, for freshness.     Jarred Salsa  Salsa is the healthy mans condiment of choice. But some are healthier than others. We passed on Pace Picante Sauce because it has 250 mg of sodium per serving.   Our Pick: Newmans Own Medium Salsa ($3.49/16 oz.)  Look for jarred salsa without any added sugar, excessive salt, or preservatives. We chose Newmans Own for its all-natural ingredients and lower sodium content (105 mg/2 Tbsp.). It does have added sugar, but only 1 g per serving.   Soup  Soup is filling, often low in calories, and can help you feel satisfied. But, canned soup can be extremely high in sodium, and contain ingredients like hydrolyzed corn protein. A classic like Campbells Regular Chicken and Rice contains MSG and mechanically separated chicken.   Our Pick: Amys Light in Sodium Soups ($3.49/can)  From Butternut Squash to Minestrone to Chicken Noodle, all of these soups are made with the same ingredients your grandmother would put in soupalong with the occasional addition of cane juice. Each can has two servings.      COMPONENTS   Chicken Stock  Prepared chicken stock can be aggressively high in sodium and may even contain MSG! Not to mention corn syrup and artificial flavorings.   Our Pick: Pacific Organic Free Range Low-Sodium Chicken Broth ($3.99/32 oz.)  Making chicken stock at home is best. And its not hard. But, if you have to buy one, Pacific Organic makes the best we found, even though it does contain chicken flavor. Whatever that is.   Vegetable Stock  As with chicken stock, making your own is best and can be done with as little as an onion, some celery, a carrot, and water.   Our Pick: Kitchen Basics Vegetable Cooking Stock, Unsalted ($3.99/32 oz.)  Made from just vegetables, its hard to find a better option. Cant find it at your local store? Its available online.   Breadcrumbs  Do your breadcrumbs contain ammonium sulfate? Progressos do. Besides being a dough conditioner, ammonium sulfates other uses include plant fertilizer, herbicide, and fire extinguisher powder. 9   Our Pick: Ians Whole Wheat Panko Breadcrumbs ($3.59/9 oz.)  Ians Whole Wheat Panko Breadcrumbs contain only unbleached whole wheat flour, malt extract, yeast, and sea salt. Basically, theyre made of bread.     Marinara Sauce  If you cant find the time to make simple marinara sauce from canned tomatoes, make sure your jarred sauce is made from natural ingredients and is low in sodium and added sugars. Hunts Traditional Marinara Sauce sneaks in high fructose corn syrup, corn syrup, and sugar. Many jarred sauces cut corners by using soybean oil instead of olive oil.   Our Pick: Silver Palate Low-Sodium Marinara Pasta Sauce ($5.29/25 oz.)  This award-winning marinara sauce has no added sugar or soybean oil. It has ingredients that should be in marinara saucetomatoes, olive oil, onions, carrots, and garlicand is sweetened with pear concentrate instead of sugar.   Olives  Olives are high in iron and vitamin E and impart a nice umami to your salad or sandwich. Kalamata olives are higher in sodium than black olives but, unlike that popular variety, they dont contain ferrous gluconate, an additive that turns green or brown olives jet black and can upset sensitive stomachs.  10   Our Pick: Early California Pitted Kalamata Greek Olives ($5.49/6 oz.)  Early Californias Pitted Kalamata Greek Olives contain the essential ingredients: olives, water, salt, and red wine vinegar.      SNACKS   Crackers  Crackers can be packed with all sorts of scientific-sounding ingredients that help them last indefinitely in packaging. Trying to find whole-grain ones? Good luck.   Our Pick: Wasa Hearty Grain or Whole Grain ($2.99/21 crispbreads)  Wasa crispbreads are tasty even though they contain just the basics: whole grains, salt, water, and yeast. Their size, hearty crunch, and versatility with toppings make them a good choice for healthy snacks and small meals too!     Tortilla Chips  If you want salsa and chips, try baked chips. Theyre lower in fat than their fried cousins and still have that satisfying crunch.   Our Pick: Guiltless Gourmet Unsalted ($2.99/7 oz.)  These contain just organic yellow corn, oil (canola, safflower, or sunflower), and lime. With just 26 mg of sodium per serving and 120 calories for 18 chips, you can snack without feeling guilty. We recommend serving the correct portion of chips in a bowl rather than digging into the whole bag.   Beef Jerky  Jerky is made with salt and sugartheres no getting around that. Avoid brands that use additives like MSG, oleoresin, hydrolyzed soy protein, and sodium erythorbate, and whatever you do, do not snap into a Slim Jim.   Our Pick: Oberto All Natural Beef Jerky (6.99/3.25 oz.)  Oberto All Natural Jerkies are seasoned and preserved with ingredients you would have in your own home, like salt, sugar, vinegar, and beef stock. This brands worst offense is natural smoke flavor. Their turkey jerky is up to snuff as well. Just remember, those small bags are not single servings!   Iced Tea  Tea leaves, waterand voila! How could something so simple have gone so wrong? Look at the ingredients list of many bottled iced teas and youll see added sugar, sucralose, aspartame, or acesulfame potassium. Youll also see 150 calories and 38 grams of sugar per serving.   Our Pick: Tejava Iced Tea ($2.09/liter)  We stumbled onto Tejava a few years ago and havent looked back. When it comes to iced tea, this is our hands-down favorite. This microbrewed black tea is simply delicious and refreshing on ice. It contains nothing but brewed handpicked tea leavesno sweeteners, no fillers, no added flavors. Just good ol tea.

Ask the Expert: What Are Probiotics and Why Do You Need Them?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/ask-expert-probiotics-need,"The short answer:  Your gut is filled with bacteria, good and bad. Good bacteria aids digestion, boosts immunity, and combats a number of gut-related illnesses. Emerging research shows it may also impact weight loss and influence mood. Bad bacteria hampers good bacteria and can make you sick in an assortment of ways, oftentimes involving repeated trips to the bathroom.   The two fight constantly.   Probiotics contain good bacteria. Youll find them either in supplement form or through real foods like yogurt, tempeh, kimchi, miso, and kombucha. By taking them, youre fortifying the troops. While theyre generally an excellent idea, theyre particularly important after youve had an infection or youve taken a round of antibiotics, because these things tend to wipe out the populations in your gut.   The long answer:  The therapeutic use of probiotics is an excellent example of ancient wisdom existing long before Western science could pull its head out. There are references to curdled milk in the Bible (Genesis 18:8 and Isaiah 7:15 if youre keeping score), but the party really got started around the start of the 20th century when Nobel Prizewinning scientist  Dr. Elias Metchnikoff  reported that Bulgarian shepherds tended to live almost twice as long as urban Parisians where he was living. He pinned this on the formers intake of fermented milk, which he felt contained good and anti-putrefactive microorganisms.   Its unclear how Metchnikoff made the connection between these two rather disparate groups, but it gave birth to the modern investigation of probiotics, so lets not complain. For the last hundred plus years, science continues to discover more and more good things about the bugs living in our intestines.   The 100 trillion (give or take a trillion) bacteria that live in your gut can be divided into over 500 types. Many of the important ones fall into one of two genera,   Lactobacillus  and  Bifidobacterium.  Under that, there are several species, many of which have specific benefits. For example,  Lactobacillus acidophilus  has been shown to be especially effective in combating lactose intolerance and Montezumas Revenge (or travelers diarrhea if you want to be boring about it). However, unless you have a specific issue that youre trying to address, you probably dont need to stress about all the species.   Fun fact one: the bad bacteria youre working to keep in check include  Helicobacter pylori,  Escherichia coli  (E. coli), and  salmonella .   Fun fact two: were born without bacteria in our guts, but the populating begins when we pass through the birth canal. Our first gasps of air provide yet more bacteria, as does breast milk, which is especially rich in probiotics.   Its well-established that probiotic consumption helps with almost any intestinal issue you can think of, including constipation, lactose intolerance, GI infections, gas, diarrhea, Crohns disease, IBS, and IBD. Its been shown to be effective in treating vaginal and urinary tract infections and atopic eczema. Theres also research showing probiotics may reduce the risk of colon cancer.   There are a few theories as to how this all happens. One is that good bacteria simply take up the space in the gut that the bad bacteria would take over. Theres also the fact that some good bacteria stimulate the immune system by promoting the release of various white blood cells that kill pathogens. A third idea is that many bacteria use the same fuel sources. For example,  Clostridium difficile,  which causes diarrhea and inflames the colon, is dependent on sugarbut so are many good bacteria. It all comes down to balance. If you have plenty of good bacteria in your gut, theyre going to dominate the monosaccharide buffet.   Look beyond GI issues, and current science on gut bacteria and probiotics gets even more amazing.  A Washington University study  on identical twinsone overweight and one thinshowed that they had entirely different gut microbiota, suggesting certain bacteria in your system promotes weight gain. ( A separate UC Berkeley study  suggests the evolutionary reason for this is that people in northern climates need more body fat, so their gut bacteria actually shifts to promote weight gain.)   But if you think popping the right probiotics will soon be the key to dropping pounds, dont get too excited. Yet another study on mice shows that weight loss bacteria doesnt seem to thrive on a high in saturated fat, low-fiber diet. However, they tend to propagate when fed a diet filled with fruits and veggies.   Researchers are also looking seriously into the gut-brain axis. In other words, those little bugs in your belly might actually have a say in your decision-making process. For instance, gut bacteria produce 95% of your serotonin, a powerful feel-good neurotransmitter.   And  a Texas Tech University study  on mice found that feeding mice the bad bacterium  Campylobacter jejuni  drove up their anxiety levels.   So, yes, you should consume probiotics. How many depends on your situation. Antibiotics wipe out the microbes in your gut, so a supplement is an excellent idea after a round of those. Beyond that, if you have a gut-related issue, its worth researching which probiotic might help and supplement thusly.   Quality probiotic supplements can be pricey though. For most people, a solid diet filled with probiotic foods should do the trick. (For the record,  Shakeology  contains  Bacillus coagulans , an especially hearty probiotic that can survive at room temperature when many probiotics require refrigeration.)   Yogurt is also a great source. However, its important to read the label. The bacteria that make the flavor and texture that Western society considers yogurt cant survive the voyage through our GI tract, so manufacturers enhance the stuff with other strains, including  Lactobacillus acidophilus  and  Bifidobacterium bifidum.   Kombucha, or fermented tea, is another great probiotic food thats especially trendy right now. It may take a while to learn to appreciate its tangy taste, but its worth it. Another benefit of kombucha is that its incredibly simple to make.   Beyond that, there are tons of other foods out there that are technically probiotic, including tempeh, sauerkraut, pickles, miso, and various cheeses. Unfortunately, these foods are often heated or pasteurized in such a way that kills the bacteria, so check on the label to verify if the probiotics are still active. Another option is to seek out a boutique producer who deliberately maintains the bacteria in their foods. Or you might want to make them yourself.  Sandor Ellix Katzs  The Art of Fermentation  is an excellent resource for your bacterial DIY needs.   On a final note, remember that fruit and veggie thing a few paragraphs up? Well, it applies to all the benefits of probiotics. Gut bacteria thrives on certain foods called prebiotics, so its crucial to make them part of your diet. Foods especially high in prebiotics include asparagus, onion, leek, garlic, artichokes, oats, and bananas. Yacon root, which youll find in Shakeology, also contains prebiotics.   So make prebiotics and probiotics a cornerstone of your diet because if youre good to all those little bugs in your gut, theyll return the favor tenfold.   Do you have a question for our experts?

How ASYLUM Can Spike Your Fitness
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/how-asylum-can-spike-your-fitness,"THE ASYLUM  Volumes 1 and 2 may be billed as athletic training, but in reality theyre far more than that. Those ready to withstand their rigors will find a veritable fountain of youth. Lets lift the hood on Shaun Ts latest exercise programs to see if youre ready to get in the game.   ASYLUM Volumes 1 and 2 mimic athletic training, but these programs are not just for athletes. The movements youll learn are the same you use in your day-to-day life to stand up, sit down, clean house, do yard work, and so on. These movement patterns regress as we age, both naturally and because we stop pushing our limits. Training with THE ASYLUM will awaken long-dormant neuromuscular connections that will have you moving in ways you may not have done since you were a kid. There is a catch, though: Youre going to have to work for it.   How is ASYLUM different from INSANITY  Shaun says in one of the workouts, Its not  INSANITY . What he means is that its harder than INSANITY. Since most of you are aware that INSANITY is very difficult, this may be a daunting statement.   But that should not deter you. Beachbody offers several training programs that will get you ready. You dont necessarily even have to do INSANITY first.  P90X ,  TurboFire , and even  RevAbs  will prepare you adequately. Trying THE ASYLUM off the couch is  not  recommended. You likely wouldnt make it through the warm-up.   However, if you find yourself in this situation, dont fret.  Heres a 4-week ASYLUM prep schedule  thatll get you where you need to be.   Because the workouts in THE ASYLUM series are more targeted, the load is more spread out. This allows you more recovery time between similar workouts. Yes, there will be moments in each workout where you cant imagine finishing, but the cumulative effect is easier on your body and youll recover faster than you think. Also, since most of the individual workouts are under 45 minutes, and both volumes of THE ASYLUM are only one-month training phases, theres always a light at the end of the tunnel to keep you going.      What is the difference between ASYLUM Volume 1 and Volume 2?     Volume 1  Start here first. Volume 1 has 6 workouts, each of which train the body in a different way: Speed & Agility, Strength, Vertical Plyo, Back to Core, Relief, and Game Day. Theres also a bonus 10-minute workout called Overtime thats used to add a brutally hard finish to any workout.   The workouts are aptly titled; they tell you how theyre going to exhaust you. Game Day is the culmination of your training and mimics playing a bunch of sports in one day, all condensed into an hour. For those of you who want more details, click on the links below to read my analysis of each individual workout.   Workouts:  Strength , Vertical ,  Back to Core ,  Relief ,  Overtime ,  Speed & Agility , and  Game Day   Volume 2  Nailed Volume 1? Welcome to Volume 2! Part deux follows the same pattern, but ramps things up a notch. The workouts are a little longer and a little harder for the most part, but follow the same pattern.   Whats so special about THE ASYLUM?  There are two aspects of THE ASYLUM that make it unique. First and foremost, its fun. Any egghead can design a technically-advanced training system, but it takes a great trainer to make it entertaining. More than anything, ASYLUM workouts are a blast. Shaun T takes you through myriad movements in each workout that mimic playing sports. If you were ever an athlete, a lot of this training will seem familiar. But, unlike your old coach, hes combined these sports with movements based on the latest research in applied science. The results are workouts that are both scientifically sound and fun. But dont equate fun with easy. Workouts in THE ASYLUM will be a challenge, no matter who you are. Even Shaun himself struggles throughout the program. Elite fitness always must be earned.   So its fun. But does it work?  Absolutely. The second key aspect to ASYLUM is the science. The programs are based on something we call the Athletic Matrix. Essentially, its a system utilizing a wide spectrum of sports-specific training techniques that are modified to offer fitness and performance benefits beyond those sports.   We coined the term because our harder programs are based on the same kind of structure used to train professional athletes. It can cover a range of techniques. For example, P90X is like  training  for a sport in that you isolate various functions (flexibility, individual muscle groups, cardiovascular conditioning, etc.) and focus on them separately using the different workouts. On the other hand, INSANITY is like  playing  the sport because you train everything at once.   The P90X2/ASYLUM analogy is similar, but slightly more targeted.  P90X2  is like off-season training. Its what you do when you have time to systematically break down your body and build it back up to be better than it was. THE ASYLUM, with its frenetic time-efficient structure, is more like footballs tradition of Hell Weekwhat you do to get ready when the season is about to start.   With P90X and P90X2, you work across 90 daysa lengthy periodization structure where you work on specific elements of fitness, switching from one to another. In THE ASYLUM, we distill 90 days of training into a single month. This means youre training all of the physiological needs of an athlete at once. There are always some sacrifices when you do this. THE ASYLUM is less versatile than P90X2 and doesnt go as deep at training certain areas, but it does whip you into condition quicker.   Both variations are ideal for athletic training, but the Athletic Matrix provides benefits far beyond the playing field. Youre building muscle, teaching the muscle how to move in all directions, and improving your cardiovascular system, flexibility, and power. Youll be stronger, run faster, jump higher, be more flexible, and basically move like you did when you were younger. This works to your advantage whether youre throwing a 45-yard pass, dancing at your 45th birthday party, or chasing four 5-year-olds around the room.   Its game night at THE ASYLUM. You ready to play?"

Do Crash Diets Work?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/beachbody-programs/weight-loss/crash-diets-work,"Elvis Presley, the king of rock n roll, pelvic thrusts, and peanut butter and bacon sandwiches, was rumored to have once heavily sedated himself for 2 weeks in an attempt to continually sleep and lose weight. While he might have removed the bags from under his eyes, Elvis crash diet did nothing to help him cram into that jumpsuit, and he ended up gaining 10 pounds. As far back as the binge-and-purge bacchanalias of ancient Rome, people have been trying to lose weight in the fastest and sometimes strangest ways. With tactics ranging from subsisting on baby food to ingesting live tapeworms, crash diets promise quick and efficient weight loss, but at what price?      What is a crash diet?   A crash diet is any nutritional plan that severely reduces calories, is nutritionally restrictive, and is supposed to promote quick weight loss. Often the diet focuses on one food group or type, and is not usually intended for long-term use. Any diet that goes below 1,000 calories a day is considered extremely dangerous, and just one step away from starvation.      What is the benefit?   Do crash diets actually work? According to Dr. Susan Roberts, a professor of nutrition and psychiatry at Tufts University, crash diets are (at least temporarily) effective for disinhibited eaters, or those who are easily tempted by food. (Thats all of us, isnt it?) According to her study, by dropping weight quickly, those who are easily discouraged by slow and steady weight loss get instant gratification, and therefore, results. The problem, of course, is that you cant maintain a crash diet forever. Donald Hensrud, chairman of preventive medicine at Mayo Clinic, said: People could eat nothing but jelly beans and if they were eating just a small amount, they would lose weight. You might be able to get away with it for a period of time, but the more restrictive the diet isand the longer you follow itthe greater the risks.      What are those risks?   The first issue is usually nutrient deficiency, as one cannot get all of the nutrients he or she needs from a bowl of cabbage soup. It is difficult to get a sufficient amount of calcium, vitamin D, or iron on a very low-calorie diet. You can do permanent damage to your organs by not providing them with their required fuel. If you lose too much fluid, you can damage your electrolyte level, and become easily dehydrated. We know low levels of potassium and sodium can cause cramping, fainting, and even heart failure.   The next thing youre looking at is a slower metabolism. Your body is an extremely efficient machine and will slow down its resting metabolic rate in order to survive longer. This is how our ancestors made it through famine, floods, and sometimes, just winter. Over time, you will lose lean muscle without the proper nutrients to maintain it, which will lower your metabolism even further. With that slower metabolism comes decreased energy. Not only will that affect your home and work life, it will destroy your workouts.   Should you continue on the super low-cal path, you are likely to suffer catabolic reactions. You would expect to lose weight as long as your metabolism uses up more chemicals and energy than it is replacing, right? In fact, weight loss may occur for a short period resulting not from fat loss, but from breakdown of cell structures, organ tissue, bone, and muscle. The body then uses up structural proteins in order to survive. So, yes, your body will begin to consume itself.   Your emotional state will usually alter with the lower number on the scale, which is not quite low enough to compensate for how yucky you feel. Irritability, depression, and lack of patience are very common with calorie restriction. Your sleep state will be affected, as severe caloric restriction often disrupts sleep patterns and can cause insomnia. Lack of sleep, in turn, will not assist in muscle recovery, your mood, or your energy. And eventually when you return to a rational eating plan, your body will be all the more likely to store everything you eat, as it thinks it has been starving for the last few weeks.     Why, why, why?   So, why on earth would anyone do this to themselves, especially if it means only drinking lemon juice, maple syrup, and cayenne pepper? The quick fix. We are a drive-thru nation that believes instant gratification is our birthright. If we can get it in a pill or hire someone to do it for us, we will. We also live in a culture obsessed with thinness, and we seldom take into consideration how much lean muscle can actually do for us, and how much better it looks than skinny fat. So we torture ourselves with the path of least resistance and end up right back where we started, often before that high school reunion or Christmas party actually happens. And we still cant fit into that darn dress.      What is the answer?   The answer is, as it has been for centuries, to make a decision to change your life, and then to have the motivation and discipline to stick with it. Eat a clean diet, somewhere between 1,500 and 3,000 calories depending on your needs, split up over 5 to 6 meals a day with an appropriate balance of protein, carbs, and fats. Perform intense exercise that burns 500 to 800 calories a day, creating a greater caloric deficit, and speeding up your metabolism. Drink lots of water; get 8 hours of sleep; and try to avoid alcohol, refined sugar, and processed foods. Losing 1 to 2 pounds a week is not really hard to figure out, but it does take hard work and commitment to a plan.      Conclusion   Cyril Connolly, the famous writer and critic, once said, The one way to get thin is to reestablish a purpose in life. And truly, that is the kind of commitment it takes. If weight loss were easy, everyone in the world would pop a pill, subsist on only bananas, and walk for just 30 minutes a day. If weight loss were easy, we would not be inundated with Jenny Craig commercials and weight loss-based reality shows. If weight loss were easy, all of those New Years resolutions would have come to fruition. But diets alone, especially the crash variety, do not work. So stay off the diet merry-go-round and stay committed to the control of your health and your appearance. Just because Elvis couldnt lose weight without extreme means doesnt mean you cant. Of course, you probably cant get paid thousands to wear a rhinestoned spandex jumpsuit, so it evens out."

10 Ways to Incorporate Dance into Your Exercise Routine
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/10-ways-incorporate-dance-exercise-routine,"Dance is arguably the most popular form of exercise in the world. We do it to celebrate, to mourn, to mate, to express ourselves, and, most importantly, to get on reality television. Not only is it one of those magic workouts that doesnt feel like a workout, but this successive group of rhythmical steps usually set to music is a major calorie burner. It stimulates coordination, stamina, and cardiovascular conditioning, and it builds muscles. The average 130-pound woman can burn more than 300 calories doing an hour of ballet. But if pink tights and pirouettes arent your thing, there are dance styles to meet every skill level and interest, from pole dancing to dangling from a piece of material attached to the ceiling. Which form is right for you? Lets look at some options.   1. Ballet  Ballet is considered the basis of most dance disciplines. It was first introduced in 1581 as a form of entertainment in the European courts and has evolved into the most strenuous of all performing arts. Ballet classes are usually divided into two parts, the first of which involves holding onto a bar that is attached to the wall. This is where you get a lot of the benefits of placement, core work, and muscle building. The rest of the class is usually completed in the center of the room, where you get the cardiovascular benefits as well as coordination and stamina. Should you be a bit timid about the class option, a program like  Yoga Booty Ballet Ab & Butt Makeover  can give you many of the same benefits without you having to leave your living room. Getting that toned and lithe ballerina body without having to remove your pajamas? Priceless.   2. Jazz  Jazz is a form of dance that is often difficult to define because so many styles fall under this category. The style seems to have emerged in the late 1800s, and until the 1950s, it included the cakewalk, the jitterbug, African-American vernacular dance, and the Charleston. With the emergence of Broadway, the now smooth style of jazz dance came into being. And still, there are endless types of jazz dance, all of which are amazing forms of exercise. Because jazz is fast-paced, high-energy movement, you will burn numerous calories, increase your flexibility and stamina, and shape your thighs and butt better than any ThighMaster will. Classes for people of all ages and skill levels can be found at studios, community centers, and universities.   3. Tap dance  While being incredibly intricate, tap dance seems to be one of the easiest forms of dance for an adult to learn. Tap is creating music with your feet, and anyone with a sense of rhythm and loose ankles can become proficient with enough practice. The downside of tap is that because it is so detailed, the smaller movements can mean that you burn fewer calories. Still, the ability to move like Gene Kelly can well compensate for the fact that you might still need your Turbo Jam workouts to shed the pounds.   4. Hip Hop  Hip hop dancing started in the early 1970s, with its roots in break dancing and popping and locking. As hip hop music evolved in the 1980s, so did the many styles of street dancing that we call hip hop today. Hip hop is fun, high energy, and often set to popular music. Hip hop also works your core, which is why a program like  Hip Hop Abs  can be so effective. Classes can be found all over the place, including gyms, dance studios, and even through park and recreation departments. Just think about how great you will look.   5. Contemporary and Modern  Although based in ballet, contemporary and modern dance styles were a direct rebellion against the rigid discipline and rules of ballet. Contemporary and modern dance are concerned with expression yet still require a degree of technical proficiency that often means years of practice. The focus of most forms of contemporary dance is the center, or your core, which means that you will easily work on and strengthen your stomach and back muscles. These forms of dance are readily found in the university system but can also be found at dance studios.   6. Ballroom and Latin  Ballroom and Latin dance styles have been around for as long as people have danced in Europe and South America, but theyve become widely popular in the U.S. in the last century, thanks to Fred Astaire, Arthur Murray, and  Dancing with the Stars . Ballroom dance styles are particularly enjoyable as they are done with a partner, and you only need a few hours to learn some of the most basic steps. Because of its low-impact nature, ballroom dancing is appropriate for all age groups, does not require extreme flexibility, and can range from a slow waltz to a boppin Texas two-step to a fast West Coast swing. Whats more, while youre shedding pounds, youre preparing for your cousins wedding, your class reunion, and possibly an inauguration ball. Talk about motivation.   7. Alternative  Alternative dance styles, or PG-13 classes, include pole dancing, stripteasing, and burlesque dancing. As these new expressions of movement become more mainstream, everyone from the sorority girl to the grandmother is giving them a shot. Besides the obvious advantage to learning these dance styles, the upper-body strength required for dancing on a pole is rather amazing. Whats more is that these adult dance styles not only move you toward having a fitter body, but even before getting that fitter body, many women gain self-confidence.   8. Tissue  Tissue dancing is a form of aerial acrobatics that is often seen in circus-style shows like Cirque du Soleil. Remember 10th-grade gym class and climbing the rope? Now imagine wrapping yourself up in the rope, hanging upside down like a bat, and quickly unraveling yourself until you almost hit the floor. This, and hundreds of other tricks, is done with a very strong piece of material hung from the ceiling and very daring participants who are willing to be sore for many days following the class. There is a huge emphasis on upper-body strength, flexibility, and the core in tissue dancing. Classes are readily available in most metropolitan cities, and workshops are offered through many companies that travel nationwide.   9. Belly  Belly dancing, or Middle Eastern-style dancing, can be traced back to the 12th century, but its exact origin is a giant controversy. Some believe it has religious origins, others think that it was a part of childbirth, and still more fight over it whether it originated in Egypt, Africa, or Greece. In the Middle East, its taught to both boys and girls very casually, and its become increasingly popular in the U.S. in the last 20 years. Belly dancing requires great control of the stomach muscles and the ability to move different parts of the body while isolating and holding others still. As a quick note, belly dancing tends to favor curves, so if youre a woman who prefers to bask in the glory of her natural lines, this is the perfect art form for you.   10. Folk  Each culture has held on to a piece of its history by imparting the dances of its ancestors to its young. Just as each cultural dance is completely different, so is the amount of calories you might expend or the different muscle groups that might get stimulated. For instance, Irish stepping or Bollywood dancing might be the equivalent of running 5 miles, while Japanese fan dancing might be more akin to doing laundry. Regardless, if the style of dance is meaningful to you, and you are exercising, the fact that you are moving is the most important thing! Find the type of folk dance that interests you and also the kind of music that you enjoy. I spent an afternoon at a Highland dance competition, and after 7 hours of bagpipe music, I was ready to remove my ears.   There is a world of dance options out there that can be fun and also help create the body of your dreams. As with all new forms of exercise, do the research and find a qualified instructor, class, or video series before you begin your journey. And if the class option is not for you, go find a dance floor in a local bar or blast the stereo in your living room, and just start dancing. Because if you think you can dance, really, you can."

Eat Your Way to Great Abs with These 7 Tips
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/nutrition/eat-way-great-abs-7-tips,"When it comes to creating incredible abs, even the most effective workout programs can only bring you so far. Thats because you cant get a flat, hard midsection without losing body fat. No matter how much effort you put into creating a six-pack, no ones going to see it if its covered by a layer of flab.   If youre following the dietary guidelines of a Beachbody fitness program, youll automatically be eating the right foods to lose fat as you get in shape. But the following seven principles can give you an extra edge, and will help ensure that the effort youre putting into your abs will bring you the results you want.   1. Get plenty of protein  Eating enough lean protein promotes fat loss  and  muscle gain, the two most important elements for developing great abs. It also helps keep you from getting hungry while youre eating right. You dont have to gobble down 12-ounce steaksjust eat a normal portion of lean meat, fish, low-fat dairy, or vegetarian protein with every meal, and make sure your snacks contain some protein, too. If you still have a hard time getting enough in your diet, a daily  Shakeology  shake can be a perfect addition.   By the way, protein is especially important in the morning, when a lot of people dont get as much as they should. A protein-rich breakfast will help keep your blood sugar steady for hours, preventing the dips that can lead to cravings later in the day. (Try some low-fat chicken sausage, or an omelet with one whole egg and three egg whites, along with fruit or whole-grain toast.)   2.Reconsider your carbs.  Despite the popularity of low-carbohydrate diets, the average American meal is still too high in sugar and fast-burning starches to bring body fat down to ab-baring levels. Its time to say goodbye to sweetened soda, ditch the Doritos, and save the cake for your birthday. If your fitness plan calls for a sports drink before a long cardio workout, or a carb-and-protein recovery drink after resistance training, thats fine. But the rest of the time, stick with foods that are on the low end of the glycemic index (refer to GlycemicIndex.com for more information)these foods burn more slowly, so they wont spike your blood sugar and insulin levels.   3. Have fun with fiber.  Something about the word fiber just doesnt sound appetizing. But high-fiber foods can actually be quite delicious: fresh berries and other fruits, salads loaded with colorful produce, your favorite steamed vegetables or vegetable soup, stews or chili made with beans, chewy whole-grain breads and cerealsYou get the picture. (These foods just happen to be loaded with nutrients as well.) High-fiber foods keep you fuller with fewer calories, and they help keep your digestive system working at its besta double-whammy for getting rid of belly bulge.   4. Enjoy some yogurt.  Probiotics, the healthful bacteria found in yogurt and other fermented foods, have been proven to help reduce belly fat. In a recent study in Finland, new mothers who took probiotic supplements averaged smaller waist circumferencesand lower body fat in generalthan those who didnt take probiotic supplements. And while the topic is still controversial, studies have found that eating lots of calcium-rich dairy foods like yogurt may increase overall weight loss.   5. Dont forget to eat.  Tempted to lower your daily calorie count by skipping meals? Dont. Going hungry can raise your levels of the stress-related hormone cortisol, which research has found can increase belly fat even in otherwise thin women. And eating too infrequently can lower your metabolism and energy levels, while increasing the chance that youll get too hungry and decide to chuck your meal plan entirely. If youre eating the right foods, regular meals and snacks will keep your body fueled while youre working toward that strong core.   6. Drink more fluids.  Hydration is important when youre on a fitness plan, but drinking plenty of water has particular benefits for your midsection. It helps keep your stomach full, so you dont overeat, and it helps flush out excess sodium to prevent belly bloating. (Eating more potassium-rich foods, such as tomatoes and bananas, will also help in this area.) Plain ol H 2 0 cant be beat, but you can also switch it up with flavored waters, iced tea, and anything else you like to drink that isnt full of sweeteners. How much do you need? The old rule of 8 glasses a day is a good start, but everyone is different: drink more if youre exercising or its hot out, and drink less if youre running to the bathroom every 5 minutes.   7. With one exception.  Its time to cut down on the hooch. The proverbial beer belly isnt just the result of extra caloriesalcohol actually makes it more difficult for your body to metabolize carbs and fat. Booze also stimulates your appetite and lowers your inhibitions, which can lead to bingeing. The best road to flat abs is no alcohol at all, but if you really like a drink now and then, just have one at a time (and no more than a few a week), and stay away from higher-calorie beers and sugary mixed drinks.   If you add these rules to your fitness plan, youre sure to see faster improvements in your midsection. Of course, theres an added bonus to eating this way: itll keep you healthier, too. That may not be as big an inducement as great abs, but were throwing it in for free."

What You May Not Know About Postpartum Depression
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/lifestyle/what-you-may-not-know-about-postpartum-depression,"Its not surprising that many new moms find themselves in a funk right after having a baby. Hormones are out of whack, sleep is a distant memory, and your entire  life  has been turned upside down by an adorable little squish, who is (no pressure!) totally dependent on you for everything.   So, yeah, a mild case of the baby blues is both normal and understandable.   But for many women, the funk doesnt go away after those first few weeks. According to the  American Psychological Association , as many as 16 percent of women experience postpartum depression, a more prolonged and severe illness.   Postpartum depression and the baby blues share many symptoms, including mood swings, crying jags, sadness, insomnia, and irritability, says Dr. Michelle Golland, a clinical psychologist in Hollywood, CA. But while the baby blues only last a few weeks, PPD symptoms stick around longer, and symptoms  can be more severe, including finding difficulty in caring for your newborn and suicidal thoughts.   Many people think of postpartum depression as something that only strikes during the first few months of mommyhood. New moms are typically screened for postpartum depression after the birth and again at their post-baby checkup.   But PPD can actually strike anytime within the first postpartum year. Researchers at Olmsted Medical Center recently  discovered  that when follow-up screenings were given at the six-month and one-year marks, there was a significant increase in the number of PPD cases. This may not be late-onset PPD. It may be the emergence of symptoms that have been lingering under the surface,  says Karen Kleiman, MSW, LCSW, founder of The Postpartum Stress Center and author of Therapy and the Postpartum Woman .      How can postpartum depression go unnoticed for so long?  For starters, the symptoms of depression mirror the symptoms ofwellhaving a newborn in the house. Youre stressed, youre exhausted, you see your friends less, and you find yourself weeping at home makeover shows. (Erso Ive heard.)   Kleiman says moms, may confuse their symptoms for normal postpartum experiences and not be able to tell the difference between being tired and being unable to function well.   At that first post-baby checkup, none of those things might seem worth mentioning. But screen again at six months, and a woman may think:  Hey, this has been going on for a while now, and it doesnt feel normal.   Even if a new mom does suspect somethings wrong, she may put off reporting her symptoms due to the stigma surrounding mental illnessespecially since societal expectations tell her shes expected to be bursting with baby bliss. They may be getting messages from their support network to be strong or power through, Kleiman says. They may feel if they tell anyone what they are really thinking, someone will think they are crazyor worse, take their baby away from them.   The recent research indicates that additional screenings could play a key role in helping to identify more women who may be at risk, so theyre able to get the treatment they need. Postpartum women should be screened repeatedly, Kleiman says. A low screen score does not necessarily mean she is out of the woods. A woman is most at risk for emotional illness during and after pregnancy than at any other time in her life. She should be monitored closely during these times.   Until these additional screenings become the norm, its important to tune in to your own emotionsand listen to concerned friends who may be able to recognize your symptoms before you can.  There is no shame in seeking help.   Please remember that self-care is  not  selfish and that your baby needs you to be emotionally well, says Dr. Golland, who struggled with PPD herself as a new mom. Give yourself breaks when needed: baths, time with friends, and whatever else your brain and body need to feel solid and grounded. Its also critical that you get enough sleep; being sleep-deprived can have a snowball effect for new moms leading to PPD. Talk about how youre feeling and the symptoms youre struggling to manage. I would also encourage fathers and other family members to know the warning signs of PPD and to intervene when needed."

Can Exercise Help Relieve Depression?
",https://www.teambeachbody.com/teambeachbodyblog/fitness/can-exercise-help-relieve-depression,"Throughout his life, former British Prime Minister Winston Churchill suffered from depression, a disease he described as the Black Dog. Having wrestled with it myself since childhood, I can say with some authority that theres no more apt description. Although its presence has lessened over the years as Ive done the work, there are still mornings when I awake to find my own, private Black Dog waiting for me at the foot of the bed, its mournful stare setting the tone for the entire day. In my youth, it would follow me for weeks or months, becoming bigger and more menacing the more I tried to ignore it. Today, I have fixes that shorten its stay.   Im one of those fortunate depressives who can find solutions without pharmaceuticalsalthough it takes effort. So when the Black Dog visits, after Ive dealt with my usual daily tasks like watering and feeding my charges, feeding and watering myself, and sending a few work emails so that I appear productive (all challenging tasks on a bad day), I slide into my cycling kit, clip on my shoes and helmet, hop on my bike, and head out on the road for some therapy.   Although anyone whos ever gone for a walk to clear their head already knows this, the notion that exercise fights depression is fairly well established. A review of 25 studies in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine unveiled strong evidence of its preventative benefits, even if that exercise is just light cardio a few hours each week. Does that make it a great way to shake the occasional blahs? You bet! Will it cure you if you have a major issue? Probably not. Exercise doesnt necessarily solve the whole problem, says Sport & Exercise Psychologist Dr. Haley Perlus, but it alleviates a lot of the day-to-day symptoms.   And, as anyone whos ever dealt with depression knows, alleviating those day-to-day symptoms the Black Dog presents can be incredibly powerful, so exercise should surely be one of the primary tools in your psychological toolbox.   What is Depression?  There are many shades of depression, but its best defined by the Mayo Clinic as a mood disorder that causes a persistent feeling of sadness and loss of interest. There are a number of possible causes, including brain chemistry, hormone imbalances, genetics, and life trauma. It can range from temporary melancholy to lifelong clinical depression. Triggers are also varied. Major events such as death of a loved one or divorce may cause it. Many mothers experience postpartum depression. Some people experience Seasonal Affective Disorder, meaning theyre actually impacted by a lack of sunlight. Othersas is my casesimply wake up some mornings feeling rotten without being 100% certain why (although I can usually dig up the root cause with a good meditation session).   One tricky aspect of depression is that people whove never experienced it have a hard time sympathizing. Its not like diabetes or a heart condition, with easily comprehensible pathology. You dont just snap out of a depression and you should never write off a friend or family members depression as something thatll just pass. Speaking firsthand, theres a lot of ugly stuff floating around in your gray matter when youre having an episodeincluding thoughts that can lead to choices seemingly illogical to the outside observer. Case in point, the recentand very tragicdeath of comedian Robin Williams.   So, its important to address the issue head-on, typically with therapy, medication, or some combination thereof. There are also a number of practices that can help, including meditation, journaling, self-help books, and the focus of this article: exercise.   How Does Exercise Help?  Exercise makes you feel good. Yes, it can also make you feel sore and exhaustedbut in a good way, on many different levels.   For one, it has a direct, chemical impact on your brain. How this happens isnt 100% understood, but in his book Spark: The Revolutionary New Science of Exercise and the Brain, Dr. John Ratey does a great job at fleshing out the various hypotheses, which all seem to center around the way exercise impacts your brain in much the same ways antidepressants do.   The first theory is that both boost endorphins, the morphine-like hormones responsible, at their most extreme, for the runners high.   Another theory looks at neurotransmitters, chemicals in your brain responsible for ushering various specific signals to where they need to go. For example, norepinephrine is a neurotransmitter and hormone that helps you focus in stressful situations, including exercise. With it, you make smarter choices. Another neurotransmitter, dopamine, motivates you and improves your mood in general. When you exercise, it pushes you to work harder. Serotonin is also released when you exercise, but it has the opposite influence. It improves mood like dopamine, but it mellows you out, counteracting the various stress hormones activated by exercise and helping you wind down after a workout.   These neurotransmitters are boosted in various degrees by various antidepressant medications. Theyre also boosted by exercise.   Both antidepressants and exercise also increase a substance called brain-derived neurotropic factor (BDNF), which protects the brain against the damaging effects of the stress hormone cortisol. It also helps the brain stay strong in general. As Ratey puts it, it serves as a fertilizer that encourages neurons to connect to one another and grow. Its been found to be low in depressed patients.   Beyond your cranial chemistry, exercise also helps you feel good about yourself from a psychological standpoint. Working your body is a choice you make to better yourself, so doing it makes you feel better about yourself. Its a process that Dr. Perlus refers to as coping self-esteem, a way of proving to yourself that you have at least some control over your life. If I go outside for a walk, or put on a DVD and do ten minutes of core work, thats a choice I made to help myself and I got through it, and that increases my coping self-esteem, she explains, and thats as important as all the serotonin, norepinephrine, and other neurotransmitters Ive released.   But theres a catch. For exercise to work like this, it needs to be something you actually dig. It needs to be something you choose, that brings you joy otherwise it wont help from a depression standpoint, Perlus adds. This is yet another reason why when people ask me which Beachbody program will give them the best results, I tell them to pick the one that looks the most fun.   Does Exercise Replace Antidepressants and Therapy?  If youre temporarily down in the dumps, exercise alone might do the trick. If youre having a depressed mood because something negative happened in the day, but you generally have a positive outlook on life, then exercise would be my primary recommendation, says Dr. Perlus.   But if its a persistent or intense depression, the answer is no. Depression is a serious medical issue and, like all medical issues, your best path is to seek professional help. Explains Perlus: When were talking about clinical depression, while exercise is an important tool for relieving depression, you need to balance it out with all the other tools. Some people do need to be medicated. Im a high advocate of talk therapy.   Dr. Perlus isnt alone in recommending exercise be part of your healing strategy. Its become a common prescription for depression in Europe and in 2013, the Journal of Psychiatric Practice laid out information for doctors wishing to include prescriptive exercise in their recommendation. The guidelines call for exercise 35 times a week (more wouldnt hurt) for 4560 minutes. 1012 weeks of this are needed for maximum anti-depressive effect. Although this is a good starting place, other recommendations vary. Also keep in mind that research shows inactivity to increase the occurrence of depression. In other words, it doesnt matter which exercise you do to beat the blues. But, by all means, get off your butt and do it.   I fought depression for years on my own. It wasnt until my mid-twenties, when I embraced therapy and discovered my passion for outdoor sports, that solutions presented themselves. After years of work, Ive reached a point where exercise and meditation are my primary sources of depression management.   Today, I know that when the Black Dog randomly visitsor if life issues a blow that knocks me to my kneesgetting on that bike is key. (Sometimes its the surfboard, kayak, or yoga mat, but you get the idea.) Rolling for miles and miles on an open road, feeling my legs burn as I strain up hills, racing fellow cyclists to the nearest stop sign, these things dont solve my problems, but they put my brain in a place where I can cope with the issues. When I come home, sweaty, exhausted, hungry, and (sometimes) smiling, the Black Dog might not be gone, but hes no longer a threat. I now have the strength to simply acknowledge him and go about my dayand thats the best way to make him go away."
