",http://www.drperlmutter.com/prenatal-probiotics-paving-way-healthy-baby/,"Eczema is becoming a fairly common problem in young children. This condition is characterized by frequent outbreaks of reddened, inflamed skin with significant itching. But beyond the discomfort, it is now recognized that when children are diagnosed with eczema, they have a much greater risk of other immune issues, like persistent inflammation of the nose and eyes, as well as full-blown asthma.   Its now become clear that the level of inflammation in the human body is determined, to a significant degree, but the health and diversity of the bacteria living in the gut. In fact, an astounding 70% of the immune cells in our bodies are clustered around the intestines!   So its no surprise that researchers have begun looking at ways to modify the gut bacteria in children in hopes of balancing inflammation and the immune system, specifically as this relates to eczema.   Scientists in Finland recently tried to determine if probiotics , given to pregnant women, might reduce the chance of their babies developing eczema. Women were selected if they themselves had allergies, as this increases the chances that their babies will develop eczema. The study involved several hundred women, half of whom were given a probiotic during their last two months of pregnancy, as well as during the first two months of breastfeeding. The other group received a placebo.   The results of the study were dramatic. The risk of developing eczema in the probiotic group was an astounding 70%  lower  than the placebo group, with the authors concluding:   Maternal probiotic supplementation during the last 2 months of pregnancy and the first 2 months of breastfeeding significantly reduced the risk of developing eczema in high-risk infants in this study. Note that the probiotics were administered exclusively to the mothers, whereas the infants did not receive probiotics.   This is exciting news. Simply modifying the mothers gut bacteria with the use of prenatal and postnatal probiotics imparted profound protection on the newborn, in terms of a healthy immune system.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/pesticide-zika-carrying-mosquitos-lesser-two-evils/,"War has been declared against  Aedes aegypti  mosquitoes, carriers of the dreaded Zika virus. With some pretty solid evidence linking Zika to microcephaly, as well as Guillian-Barre syndrome, governments in affected countries are going all out as they attempt to reducemosquito populations.   Predictions now anticipate that Zika virus will soon find its way into North America. So the images of trucks fogging neighborhoods in Brazil, that have become so common in the news as this problem worsens, may soon become real-life experiences for Americans in Florida and other southern states.   One of the most commonly used classes of fogging agents to kill adult mosquitoes are the  pyrethroids . Though there is a move now to embrace the idea of bringing DDT back into the game, pyrethroids remain pretty much the first line of defensewhen it comes to fogging infested neighborhoods and homes throughout the Americas.   Pyrethroids are often depicted as being harmless, by virtue of the fact that they are synthetic analogues of an extract of chrysanthemum flowers (of all things), and what could possibly be wrong with that? As it turns out, theres much that warrants concern.   First, heres what our own  CDC  has to say about their safety:   Human health effects from pyrethroid pesticides at low environmental doses or at biomonitored levels from low environmental exposures are unknown.   This statement isnt referring to an accidental exposure at a high concentration. Theyre telling us that  even when considering a low level exposure , the health effects are unknown. Think about that next time you see images of homes being fogged.   But heres whats even more concerning: In 2014, researchers at the UC-Davis published  a study of 970 children  living in Northern California, in which they explored possible environmental links to autism. The study looked at exposure of pregnant women to commonly used commercial pesticides by looking at how close they lived to farms spraying these chemicals during their pregnancy.   The researchers specifically evaluated risk of autism in relation to exposure to pyrethroids, yes, the same pesticide now being used to carpet bomb Zika-carrying mosquitos. The study shows that exposure of mothers to pyrethroids during the third trimester of pregnancy was associated with an 87% increased risk of autism for their child.   In the field of medicine, we are schooled to evaluate any intervention by considering its risk/benefit ratio. So far, it looks like the benefit employing pyrethroids with the hope of possibly getting a leg up on Zika virus infections is getting the mostattention. Prudence dictates that we consider potential risks as well following the dictum of above all, do no harm.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/christopher-e/,"I really enjoyed Christophers story, and its one I think youll want to share with friends or family members who are hesitant to try out this lifestyle.  Dr. Perlmutter   Thought Id throw this out there because Ive managed to drastically improve my health with a few changes.   I didnt start out unhealthy, but I had let myself get run down through a combination of work stress, physical stress, and poor nutrition. Im not an old guy and Ive always been able to get away with whatever I wanted to do, so why not work eighty hours a week, train to climb a mountain, and knock out the Bataan Death March all in a six month period, all while getting four hours of sleep a night and supplementing with lots of coffee! Shockingly, I started feeling super-fatigued every day a few weeks after the mountain climb, and then, to my surprise, my hair started falling out. Seriously, patches of hair started falling out! Being an Army Officer, I keep my hair short, but one day one of my sergeants said, Sir, whats going on with the back of your head? I checked it out and sure enough, I had a bald patch on the back of my head.   Over the months, it kept getting worse, and the dermatologist said it was alopecia and that we might be able to treat the patches with steroid injections. Without that, Doc said they may get better or worse, but said the best thing I could do was limit stress. Yeah right. I got orders to change duty stations, and my wife told me that we were pregnant all in the same month. The patches kept getting worse over the months, and being a leader and a guy who works in healthcare, it certainly didnt help my leader presence or put patients at ease to see my patchy head.   Fast forward eight months or so after moving and I picked up a copy of  Grain Brain.  Intrigued by the assertion that some nutritional supplements (gasp) were being touted by a Neurologist as being neuroprotective and restorative, along with the idea that the gut microbiome could impact not only brain but also just about every system in your body, I quickly read the entire book.   Feeling and looking terrible, I went ahead and gave the ketogenic diet a shot and I began six of the seven supplements suggested in the book (minus the resveratrol). We had the baby the next month (Sep 2015), so my stress level and sleep got worse, but the patches magically started filling in. By January they were all gone, and I no longer feel like Im lifting a piano every time I get out of bed. Ive also lost 20 pounds.   The success has inspired and empowered me, and now Im tackling my stress and sleep.  I recently began a daily meditation period this week (not sure if its doing anything but Im hopeful), writing a gratitude list, and Im trying to get seven hours of sleep every night. I seriously used to think this homeopathic stuff was laughable (was actually taught that it was garbage), but after my own personal case study (n=1), Im starting to come around.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/something-think-next-time-shampoo-pet/,"Allow me to paint a mental picture for you. Its a beautiful spring day, and a handsome young couple is outside, laughing and smiling, garden hose in hand while they bathe their golden retriever. If you look closely, you might notice that the womanis actually pregnant. What an idyllic scene!   But new research challenges the benignity of the event just described. Unbeknownst to our happy couple, the product themother-to-be is shampooing her dog in is actually creating a situation that is far from the care-free, happy portrayal wed like to embrace.   Researchers at the UC-Davis have evaluated the possible relationship between exposure to anti-flea/anti-tick pet shampoos during pregnancy and risk for autism.   The study evaluated children aged 2 to 5 years,and compared 333 children with autism spectrum disorder with 198 typically developing children. Specific diagnostic criteria were used to confirm that the children fulfilled the diagnosis for autism spectrum disorder.   The childrens mothers were interviewed for 90 to 100 minutes, and during this interview they were asked about household usage ofpest control products, weed control products, insecticide sprays, and pet shampoos, from a period of 3months prior to conception to when thechild was 1 year old. This is known as the exposure time .   Among the many findings of this study, one of the most compelling was the fact that mothers of children with autism spectrum disorder were  twice  as likely to report having shampooed their pets with anti-flea/anti-tick shampoo during the exposure time, in comparison to mothers of normallydeveloping children. Statistical analysis revealed that the active ingredient that correlated with these findings was  pyrithrin, which has been on the market for the past 20 years.   We dont know the actual cause of autism, but we do note with great concern that its incidence is rising, dramatically. Prevalence of autism, according to the CDC, is now estimated at one in 68 births with more than 3.5 million Americans living with an autism spectrum disorder. Since 2000, the prevalence of autism in the United States, in just children, has increased almost 120%, and thisincidence continues to grow.   There is no specific treatment for autism. Yet, we are now seeing more and more information that makes it clear that lifestyle choices may be playing a significant role in determining risk for this disorder. It is for this reason that I continue to present this information to anyone who will listen.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/lizzie-c/,"The story of Lizzie and her family, though long, is a must-read.  Dr. Perlmutter   I have lived the past decade of my life in terrible fear of developing early on-set Alzheimers disease. I am 26 this year, and I am the 4th child in a family of five girls. When I was 12, my mom started to get what I now know as the classic signs of Alzheimers. She was only in her 40s. Unfortunately, she ate the low-fat, whole-grain diet that was and, still is, so popular. Within a year of noticing symptoms, my mom had to go live in an assisted living home. No doctors knew what was wrong with her and many said she had Huntingtons Disease, although she tested negative for it. Three years after her first symptoms, she passed away. About five years later her sister also passed away from the same thing. My grandmotheralso had the same symptoms and died very young. They all had very stressful marriages.   My sisters and I have always been terrified of getting sick like our mother. In recent years we learned that her illness was early on-set Alzheimers. It was helpful to know the cause, but inside we all felt full of despair, as if a death sentence had been placed on us. It has affected all of our life choices, even the choice to have children and pass on this gene.   My sisters and I have always tried to eat healthy, and we all have a wicked sweet tooth. We all suffer from inflammation-related problems from chronic migraines that have landed us in the hospital, to stomachaches and constant fatigue. None of this was bad enough to think we were not healthy however. We all look fit, and never thought we were doing the wrong thing for our bodies. As I sat and read Grain Brain the day of purchase, I was eating a bowl of Cheerios. I literally put down the spoon and never ate gluten again after that day. Finally, I had answers! It was one of the best feelings I have ever had in my life. I immediately called my sisters and got them to read Grain Brain. We all got on the diet and have been sticking to it for over one year.   One of the quickest things I noticed was that the fatigue virtually went away overnight. I used to have to take a nap every weekend, and felt like I was wasting my time-off. Sometimes at work, I would drive my car to a nearby parking lot at lunch to lay in the backseat to sleep!   Today, I have so much energy I want to run all over the place! So I did, and my husband thought I had lost my mind. During this year there were two times when I was not diligent about checking my meal at a restaurant, and immediately became sick and tired. My husband had to drive me home one of these times as I lay in the backseat sleeping off the meal. I have not had any migraines since changing to this lifestyle, and they used to put me in the hospital. I never get body rashes and eczema anymore. I could go on, but suffice to say I feel so great that I will never go back to my old way of eating. Three of my sisters lost weight and got super fit looking also. They didnt look as if they needed to lose weight, but it just showed how much our bodies loved this new lifestyle.   Now we all check in on each other weekly to make sure we are still on top of our lifestyle. We are exercising, eating right, and living a stress-free lifestyle. Weve even added ina tonof fermented foods! A weight has been lifted off of us.   My sister (the first of the 5) also got pregnant this year. Before this, none of us could commit to possibly having a child go though what we watched our mother go through. Now we feel in control, and that it is a choice to activate this terrible gene we may have been passed.   -Lizzie C.        Read Next   Judy L. Outside of the wonderful story about a woman who took back control of her health, the fact that this information was shared between groups of people who wanted to help others is what makes the story Judy shares so compelling. - Dr. Perlmutter Every day I congratulate my sister in February 13, 2014 In ""Success"" Lets End The Era of Diagnose and Adios Today's post is from a close friend of Grain Brain, Max Lugavere. - Dr. Perlmutter My name is Max Lugavere and Im a filmmaker, currently in production on a feature-length, millennial-focused documentary exploring the impact of diet and lifestyle on brain health.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/eat/brain-maker-foods/,"Probiotic Foods   Active-Culture Yogurt   An explosion of yogurt brands has taken over the dairy section lately, but you have to be careful about which brands to buy; many of themboth Greek and regularare loaded with added sugar, artificial sweeteners, and artificial flavors. Read your labels. For people sensitive to dairy, coconut yogurt is an excellent dairy-free way to work plenty of enzymes and probiotics into your diet.    Kefir   The name Kefir is derived from the Turkish word  keyif which means feeling good  after consumption.  This fermented dairy product is very similar to yogurt. It is a unique combination of kefir grains (a combination of yeast and bacteria) and goats milk thats high in lactobacilli and bifidobacteria. Its also rich in antioxidants. For those who are sensitive to dairy or lactose intolerant, coconut kefir, a non-dairy version, is also delicious and equally beneficial.   Kombucha Tea   This is a form of fermented black  or green  tea that has been used for centuries. Fizzy and often served chilled, its also believed to help increase energy, and may even help you lose weight.    Tempeh   Many people, especially vegetarians, eat tempeh as a substitute for meat. Tempeh is fermented soybeans and a complete protein, with all of the amino acids. Also a great source of vitamin B12, tempeh can be cooked or crumbled over salads.    *Note: Not to be confused with  unfermented soy . The fermentation process reduces  the levels of phytic acid in tempeh, making it a much better option. Overall, I am not a huge fan of any soy derived product. But for vegetarians, this is an option.   Kimchi   A traditional Korean dish, this is a mixture of fermented vegetables and seasonings. Common ingredients include cabbage, brine, radish and spices such as ginger and chili pepper.  In addition to providing beneficial bacteria, kimchi is also a great source of calcium, iron, beta-carotene, and vitamins A, C, B1, and B2. For some it may be a little toospicy, but its one of the best probiotic foods you can add to your diet if you can handle the heat.    Sauerkraut   A german word,  Sauerkraut  translates to sour cabbage.  Not only does this fermented cabbage fuel healthy gut bacteria but it contains choline, a chemical needed for the proper transmission of nerve impulses inthe brain and throughout the central nervous system.    Pickles   No wonder many pregnant women crave pickles, among the most basic and beloved natural probiotic. For many, pickles can be your gateway food to other, more exotic fermented foods.   Pickled fruits and vegetables   Pickling fruits and veggies, such as carrot sticks, transforms the usual into the extraordinary. Whether you do this yourself or buy pickled produce, keep in mind that the probiotic benefits are only present in unpasteurized foods pickled in brine, not vinegar.   Cultured condiments   Believe it or not, you can create lacto-fermented mayonnaise, mustard, horseradish, hot sauce, relish, salsa, guacamole, salad dressing, and fruit chutney. Sour cream, while technically a fermented dairy product, tends to lose its probiotic power during processing. Some manufacturers, however, add live cultures at the end of the process; look for these brands.    Fermented meat, fish, and eggs   Consumed in may traditional fares , you can find some mouth-watering recipes from corned beef to pickled sardines and fermented hard-boiled eggs  in the recipes section of Brain Maker.     Prebiotic Foods   Acacia gum (or gum Arabic)         To reap the benefits of Acacia gum, you can buy acacia powder and mix it with water. Just 1 tablespoon will give you 6 grams of insoluble prebiotic fiberthe kind of fiber the gut bugs love for their own nourishment.         Raw chicory root         I use chicory root when cooking, as it is an excellent source of antioxidants, as well as a terrific system cleanser. Most of my chicory consumption comes viakimchi, as its an ingredient I use when making kimchi at home  (and you can find the recipe in Brain Maker) .         Raw Jerusalem artichoke   Jerusalem artichoke, which you might know better as sunroot, is actually a species of sunflower loaded with nutrients and health benefits. Specifically, besides being a great prebiotic, Jerusalem artichoke is rich in potassium and iron. During the week, I enjoy Jerusalem artichoke in salads.   Raw dandelion greens         Dandelion greens are a rich source of prebiotics. Buy a bunch of these greens for the week and add them to salads and vegetable dishes.         Raw garlic   There are myriad  health benefits to be derived from garlic , and the fact that raw garlic is packed with prebiotics is just one of them.  Lots of recipes here on my website  to help you sort out how to make sure you get some in every day.   Raw or cooked onion   Just like garlic, onions are another vegetable you might be consuming every day without realizing just how powerful it is for your health. In both raw and cooked form, onions carry a strong prebiotic load.   Raw leek   Leeks are a subtle way to add not just flavor, but nutrition to any meal you are making. Its a prebiotic powerhouse you can work into almost every dish.   Raw asparagus   One of my favorite snack foods, or side dishes, is fermented spiced asparagus  (another recipe you can find in Brain Maker) .   For other foods you should make a staple of your diet, check out this list of gluten-free foods."

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/making-sense-of-net-carbs/,"Now that the low-carbohydrate dietary recommendations have really taken hold, we are beginning to see quite a bit more information about nutritionlabeling that not only describes total carbohydrate content of a particular food, but also indicates net carbs.Depending on the type of food, there may, in fact, actually be a significant difference between these two numbers.   So lets break it down as it is actually very straightforward.   The term  net carbs simply describes the number of grams of total carbohydrates in a portion of food minus the grams of fiber . Fiber, it turns out, is a form of carbohydrate, but is not a carbohydrate that has any effect on blood sugar or insulin response. Therefore, the idea of focusing on net carbs, meaning the carbs that are left over when the fiber is removed from the equation, does make a lot of sense because it is these residual carbohydrates that strongly influence blood sugar and, consequently, insulin response.   Lets look at an example. One half cup of baby carrots contains approximately 6 grams of total carbohydrate. But there is a fair amount of fiber in whole carrots, amounting to about 2 or 3 grams in this case. So the net carbs would be about 3 or 4 grams.   An important place where this understanding comes into play is in looking at, for example, fruit juices. A one cup serving of regular orange juice provides of 25.8 grams of total carbs and only 0.5 grams of fiber, so the net carbs are about 25.3 grams. Thats enough to have a significant effect on blood sugar and insulin response.   Another way of looking at this calculation reveals that a larger difference between the total carbs and the net carbs is a good indication of the fiber content. The larger the difference, the better food.     Read Next   You Can Lose the Weight - Four Simple Steps Go to the mall. See a movie. Look around next time youre in an airport.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/breastfeeding-mothers-take-dha/,"It is estimated that in America today more than 6 million of our school-aged children have been given a diagnosis of attention deficit disorder. Whats even more disturbing is the revelation that close to 70% of these children are taking potentially dangerous, mind-altering medications to help them pay attention.   As it turns out,  research shows  that if mothers take even a low dosage of the omega-3 fatty acid DHA during the first few months of breastfeeding, there is a significant increase in the ability of their children to pay attention when they are examined as they enter school. Research shows that when children receive breast milk from mothers who were taking a single, 200mg capsule of DHA, attention scores were much better when compared to the children of non-supplemented mothers when attention tests were administered at age 5 years.  Other studies  have clearly confirmed that the level of DHA in breast milk increases as much as 2-fold following mothers supplementation.   These findings lend further support for the understanding that supplementation of DHA is important not just during pregnancy, but while nursing as well.

Breastfeeding and Later Cognitive and Academic Outcomes

John Horwood, MSc, BA, and David M. Fergusson, PhD   Abstract   Objective:  This study examines the associations between duration of breastfeeding and childhood cognitive ability and academic achievement over the period from 8 to 18 years using data collected during the course of an 18-year longitudinal study of a birth cohort of more than 1000 New Zealand children.   Method:  During the period from birth to age 1 year, information was collected on maternal breastfeeding practices. Over the period from 8 to 18 years, sample members were assessed on a range of measures of cognitive and academic outcomes including measures of child intelligence quotient; teacher ratings of school performance; standardized tests of reading comprehension, mathematics, and scholastic ability; pass rates in school leaving examinations; and leaving school without qualifications.   Results:  Increasing duration of breastfeeding was associated with consistent and statistically significant increases in 1) intelligence quotient assessed at ages 8 and 9 years; 2) reading comprehension, mathematical ability, and scholastic ability assessed during the period from 10 to 13 years; 3) teacher ratings of reading and mathematics assessed at 8 and 12 years; and 4) higher levels of attainment in school leaving examinations. Children who were breastfed for greater than or equal to 8 months had mean test scores that were between 0.35 and 0.59 SD units higher than children who were bottle-fed.  Mothers who elected to breastfeed tended to be older; better educated; from upper socioeconomic status families; were in a two-parent family; did not smoke during pregnancy; and experienced above average income and living standards. Additionally, rates of breastfeeding increased with increasing birth weight, and first-born children were more likely to be breastfed.  Regression adjustment for maternal and other factors associated with breastfeeding reduced the associations between breastfeeding and cognitive or educational outcomes. Nonetheless, in 10 of the 12 models, fitted duration of breastfeeding remained a significant predictor of later cognitive or educational outcomes. After adjustment for confounding factors, children who were breastfed for greater than 8 months had mean test scores that were between 0.11 and 0.30 SD units higher than those not breastfed.   Conclusions:  It is concluded that breastfeeding is associated with small but detectable increases in child cognitive ability and educational achievement. These effects are 1) pervasive, being reflected in a range of measures including standardized tests, teacher ratings, and academic outcomes in high school; and 2) relatively long- lived, extending throughout childhood into young adult- hood.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/critical-role-early-life-decisions-creating-microbiome/,"In  Brain Maker , I dedicated a lot of space toexploring how we initially form our microbiome, the collection of more than 100 trillion organisms that live within our intestines. Certainly early life experiences are critical in the creation of what is now a looked upon as representing a new organ within the human body. As you will recall, I talked about how important it is for children to be born through the vaginal birth canal, if that is not medically precluded, and, also, I emphasized how fundamentally critical it is that children breastfeed, from the perspective of creating the best, most health-preserving, microbiome possible.   In a new report from researchers in Sweden,  Dynamics and Stabilization of the Human Gut Microbiome During the First Year of Life ,  researchers evaluated gut microbiomes of 98 mothers and their infants during the first year of life.   Their findings were really quite remarkable. There were dramatic differences noted in the microbiomes of children born vaginally versus those born by cesarean section. In addition, significant changes were seen in babies who were breastfed versus those who were bottle-fed. One of the main conclusions the authors reached was:   Cessation of breast-feeding drives the maturation of the infant gut microbiome.   The authors went on to state:   We observed that most of the early colonizers are derived from the mother, and that in C-section infants vertical mother-infant transmission was less frequent for important intestinal microbes such as  Bacteroides  and  Bifidobacterium , while sharing of bacteria from skin and mouth was increased, in line with an earlier study.   And further:   These studies and our results hint to the life-long effects of breast-feeding for the priming of the gut microbiome, with possible effects on metabolic and immune health that we are only beginning to understand.   The authors revealed that the changes in the microbiome of infants that more reflect the microbiome of an adult are not a random process but is induced not by food choices, like when solid food is introduced, but by the cessation of breastfeeding. As mentioned above, they feel that these changes may actually have lifelong effects in terms of metabolism and immune function.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/inflammation-affects-developing-brain/,"I have posted several blogs relating the fundamental role of inflammation to neurodegenerative conditions like Alzheimers and Parkinsons. Indeed, this is one of the central themes of  Grain Brain .   That said, weve also got to take a look at the role of inflammation in the developing brain because the same damaging effects of the chemical mediators of inflammation in the adult might well lead to issues in the delicate brains of infants and young children.   In a  new study just published  in the journal  BMC Pediatrics,  researchers looked at several parameters in infants including the frequency of febrile illnesses, as well as blood markers of increased inflammation including IL-1 beta, IL-6, and IL-4 which is thought to indicate reduction of inflammation.   What the authors discovered was dramatic. There was a significant direct relationship between higher levels of the inflammatory markers and risk for developmental issues. In addition, higher levels of IL-4, associated with lower levels of inflammation, correlated perfectly with reduced risk for developmental problems.   Further, the authors found that: Every additional 10 days of fever was associated with a 1.9 decrease in language composite score and a 2.1 decrease in motor composite score.   So the role of inflammation in brain health and function throws a wide net and does indeed prove of fundamental importance throughout the age continuum. As far as infant health is concerned, keeping inflammation down looks like an important goal. Inflammation is reduced when babies are health and have healthy immune systems. That means minimizing antibiotic exposure as much as possible, spacing immunizations so kids dont get a boatload at a single visit to the pediatrician, breastfeeding whenever possible, and doing the best you can to avoid caesarean section.

Relationship between long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids at birth and motor function at 7 years of age

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/study/relationship-between-long-chain-polyunsaturated-fatty-acids-at-birth-and-motor-function-at-7-years-of-age/,"Publication   European Journal of Clinical Nutrition   Author(s)   EC Bakker, G Hornstra, CE Blanco and JSH Vles   Abstract   Background/Objectives:  Long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) rapidly accumulate in the central nervous system (CNS) during the perinatal CNS growth spurt. This particularly concerns arachidonic acid (AA: 20:4n-6) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA: 22:6n-3), which are thought to play important roles in CNS development and function. The aim of this study was to investigate the relation between motor function at 7 years of age and the levels of AA and DHA in umbilical venous plasma phospholipids, representing the prenatal availability of these fatty acids, and in plasma phospholipids sampled at age 7 years.   Subjects/Methods:  Motor function was assessed both quantitatively (the ability to perform a movement) and qualitatively (how the movement is performed) with the Maastricht Motor Test (MMT) in 306 children, born at term, at 7 years of age as part of a follow-up study.   Results: Backward stepwise multiple regression analyses revealed a significant, positive relation between umbilical plasma DHA concentrations (but not plasma DHA levels at 7 years) and the MMT total and quality score, corrected for the covariables gender, cognitive performance, gestational age and age at measurement (partial b 14 0.13, P 14 0.01 and 0.14, P 14 0.01, respectively). The contributions of DHA and AA (both at birth and at 7 years of age) to quantitative movement scores were not significant.    Conclusions:  Our results suggest that prenatal DHA availability, which can be influenced by maternal dietary DHA intake during pregnancy, can have an effect on quality of movement in later life.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/prevention-alzheimers/,"Theres so much in the news these days calling attention to the fact that diabetes is associated with a profoundly increased risk for developing Alzheimers disease. In fact, just watch my recent  interview with Dr. Melissa Schilling  on the subject.   But theres an important point that is absolutely critical to understand. While it seems like a good idea for diabetic patients to take medication to control blood sugar, the research seems to indicate that diabetics taking these drugs do not improve their situation, in terms of lowering their risk for Alzheimers.   To be clear, I am not saying that diabetics shouldnt take their blood sugar medications. But I am saying that this looks like this one very important issue, your risk of developing Alzheimers, is  not  improved by medications designed to help normalize blood sugar.   Researchers, publishing in the journal PLOS ONE ,  followed more than 70,000 newly diagnosed adult diabetic patients over an 11-year span. Risk of developing Alzheimers, a disease for which there is  no meaningful treatment , was increased by 76% in the diabetics compared to age-matched, non-diabetic controls.   More to the point of my report, the authors found that the risk was not reduced when the subjects took medications for their diabetes, stating:   The present study demonstrates an association between DM (diabetes mellitus) and future development of AD (Alzheimers disease), suggesting that DM could play an important role in determining future risk of AD occurrence. However, we found that use of hypoglycemic agents (diabetes medications) had no beneficial effects for preventing development of AD. Further therapeutic strategies should be investigated for the prevention of AD, such as preventing DM or improving DM treatment.   Their last sentence is profound. They are clearly calling attention to the need to  prevent  diabetes as a way of preventing Alzheimers.   The study revealed that female gender was also associated with increased risk of Alzheimers, to the tune of about 24%. Of course, you cant choose your birth gender. On the other hand, your lifestyle choices play a major role in determining whether you will join the ranks of Americans with diabetes, thus I applaud these researchers for their emphasis on prevention.   Alzheimers is preventable, to a large degree, by favoring a diet that keeps blood sugar in check. Thats the message from Dr. Georgia Ede in a terrific piece just published in  Psychology Today.  What the Harvard-trained Dr. Ede has described follows, to the letter, the carb-lowering, sugar-eliminating, and fat-supportive recommendations that are central to Grain Brain .    When  Grain Brain  was first published, the notion of food choices affecting brain health was greeted with a healthy degree of skepticism. After all, that was way back in 2013 when people pretty much lived their lives as they chose, hoping that medical science would soon develop magic cures for their various health issues.   Now, 27 languages later, our recommendations are seeing welcomed validation with more and more research supporting  prevention  as our most important goal, and Im happy to report that  The Grain Brain Whole Life Plan  takes this goal to a new level by emphasizing  how  to incorporate this exciting research into your day-to-day lifestyle decisions in a way that will pave the way for health.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/asthma-epidemic-explained/,"So much has been written in scientific journals recently about how the loss of microbes in the gut, especially earlier in life, affects the immune system. For example, researcher  Marsha Wills-Karp , at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health, recently revealed how early life exposure to antibiotics is associated with a substantial increased risk for the development of asthma.   Asthma has become an epidemic in America, affecting 1 in 12 Americans and totalingaround $60 billion in direct medical costs, as well as lost work and school days, according to the Centers for Disease Control (CDC).   When we are exposed to antibiotics, which may well be a necessary medical treatment, the intervention isnt really a targeted assault on a particular offending organism. Rather, these days doctors prescribe broad spectrum antibiotics that are effective in wiping out a vast array of organisms, well beyond the offending agent, and this may include some of the good guys as well.   One of the important functions of the good bacteria, often called the  probiotic  organisms, is to naturally limit the overgrowth of potentially damaging bacterial species. Kill off the good guys, and the bad guys can move in. This is what we see, for instance, with clostridium difficile diarrhea. An antibiotic associated illness that kills around 30,000 Americans each year.   Another well-described function of various helpful bacteria is to modulate the immune system. Knock down their numbers and the immune system gets wonky  much as we see in asthma.   In fact,it is this mechanism that may explain a new report in the journal  Science Translational Medicine  in which researchers found that low or undetectable levels of four types of bacteria in children at 3 months closely predicted who would likely develop asthma, and even skin allergies, by the time they reached their first birthday. Likely the names of these organisms, Lachnospira, Veillonella, Faecalibacterium and Rothia ,  wont be familiar to most of you, but you may know that low levels of Faecalibacterium have been correlated with inflammatory bowel disease.   The study confirms how important it is to protect the gut bacteria early in life. As  Dr. Stuart Turvey , co-author of the report stated:   What I think is important and not so surprising to pediatricians was how important the very early life is and our study emphasizes that in that first 100 days the structure of the gut microbiome seems to be very important in influencing the immune responses that cause or protect us from asthma.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/coffee-healthy-choice/,"It has been estimated that around 60% of Americans over the age of 18 report that they are regular coffee drinkers. No doubt what most motivates this consumption is the familiar and dependable lift that coffee provides.   What may be less familiar to us consumers of this popular beverage is the ever-widening base of information that reveals some significant health benefits associated with this drink.   According to the Harvard School of Public Health, coffee consumption has been associated with a reduced risk for the development of type 2 diabetes (T2D). T2D is characterized by elevation of blood sugar and that can have implications for any and all parts of the body. From my perspective as a neurologist, T2D is thought to actually  double  a persons risk for the development of Alzheimers disease (more on that in a moment).   Harvard also reports that regular coffee consumption could lower the rate at which liver cancer progresses, may help prevent gallstones, is not harmful with respect to heart attacks or strokes, and may well be associated with a reduced risk of developing Parkinsons disease, a movement disorder now diagnosed in about half a million Americans.   To be fair, there are some possible downsides. Women who are consuming high amounts of caffeine may be at increased risk for miscarriage or stillbirth, and caffeine can raise blood pressure and heart rate.   Aside from reducing risk for T2D and its implications for dementia, there may well be other mechanisms at play with respect to coffees ability to protect the brain. Researchers presenting data at the Alzheimers Europe annual conference in Glasgow have studied the risk of developing dementia in a group of adults over a four year period. They found that those who consumed three to five cups of coffee per day had about a 20% less chance of developing dementia. Their research revealed that the brains of the coffee drinkers actually showed less development of  amyloid plaques , a hallmark of Alzheimers disease.   Their conclusions focused on the role of chemicals in coffee called  polyphenols,  which function as protective antioxidants and are known to favorably impact the gut bacteria. Caffeine itself is known to have some direct and positive effects on the brain which may also play a role.   Dr. Iva Holmerova, serves as vice chairman of  Alzheimer Europe . She commented on the research stating:   The findings presented in this report are very encouraging and help to develop our understanding of the role nutrition can play in protecting against Alzheimers Disease. Coffee is a very popular beverage enjoyed by millions of people around the world, and Im pleased to know that moderate, lifelong consumption can have a beneficial effect on the development of Alzheimers Disease.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/learn/resources/probiotics-five-core-species/,"Its overwhelming how many probiotics are now available today, and the number of different combinations available as nutritional supplements at health food stores, and even added to foods, is growing. There are myriad different species of bacteria that make up the human microbiome, but science has identified some major players, and aggressively studied these in both animals and humans. As such,Ill focus on this core group of probiotic species.   To make the task of finding and purchasing the right formulas as easy as possible, Ive simplified my recommendation to just 5 core species that are widely available:  Lactobaccilus plantarum, Lactobaccilus acidophilus, Lactobaccilus brevis, Bifidobacterium lactis  and  Bifidobacterium longum . Different strains provide different benefits, but these are the ones that will support your bodys biology by doing the very things weve been discussing since the beginning of the book when it comes to sustaining brain health.     Lactobaccilus plantarum : Found in kimchi, sauerkraut, and other cultured vegetables, this bug is one of the most beneficial bacteria in your body. It survives in the stomach for a long time and performs many functions that help regulate immunity and control inflammation in the gut. It also helps fortify the gut lining, fending off potential invaders that might compromise the intestinal wall and sneak into the bloodstream. In fact, L. plantarums beneficial impact on the gut lining is perhaps its most important attribute, for it reduces gut permeability, thereby reducing the associated risks for leaky gutincluding an increased risk for virtually every brain disorder. Moreover, L. plantarum can quickly digest protein, and this has the ultimate effect of preventing food allergies and even treating such allergies when they arise. Its been shown in experimental animal studies to protect engineered mice from having clinical symptoms of multiple sclerosis and even reduce the inflammatory response typical of that condition. Finally, L. plantarum has anuncanny ability to absorb and maintain important nutrients such as brain-friendly omega- 3 fatty acids, vitamins, and antioxidants. All of these actions make L. plantarum essential for fighting infection and taking control of any pathogenic bacteria.   Lactobaccilus acidophilus : L. acidophilus is the darling of fermented dairy products, including yogurt. It keeps the balance of good vs. bad bacteria in check and in doing so, aids your immune system. In women, it helps to curb the growth of Candida albicans, a fungus that can cause yeast infections. L. acidophilus has also gained fame for its ability to help maintain cholesterol levels. In the small intestine, L. acidophilus produces many beneficial substances that combat pathogenic microbes, including acidolphilin, acidolin, bacteriocin, and lactocidin.   Lactobaccilus brevis : Sauerkraut and pickles owe a lot of their benefits to this bug, which improves immune function by increasing cellular immunity and even enhancing killer T cell activity. Its so effective in combating vaginosis, a common bacterial infection of the vagina, that its added to pharmaceuticals used to treat it. L. brevis also acts to inhibit the effects of certain gut pathogens. Perhaps best of all, it has been shown to increase levels of that all-star brain growth hormone BDNF.   Bifidobacterium lactis (also called B. animalis) : Fermented milk products like yogurt contain this gem, which is well documented to have a powerful effect on preventing digestive ills and boosting immunity. Its also known to be helpful in knocking out food-born pathogens like salmonella, which causes diarrhea.   Bifidobacterium longum : Just one of the 32 species that belong to the genus bifidobacterium, this is one of the first bugs that colonize our bodies at birth. It has been associated with improving lactose tolerance and preventing diarrhea, food allergies, and the proliferation of pathogens. Its also known to have antioxidant properties as well as the ability to scavenge free radicals. In laboratory mice, B. longum has been shown to reduce anxiety. Like L. acidophilus, B. longum also helps maintain healthy cholesterol levels."

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/gut-bacteria-chart-destiny/,"I have just finished reviewing what I believe is a seminal research article relating to the gut microbiome. The study, written by researchers in Sweden, is titled The Gut Microbiotia Masters of Host Development and Physiology, and recently appeared in Nature Reviews Microbiology.   If youve been following my blog, you are no doubt aware of my keen interest in the role of the gut bacteria, the human microbiome, in the context of how these organisms relate to disease processes. Further, my new book,  Brain Maker: The Power of Gut Microbes to Heal and Protect Your Brainfor Life , is focused on exploring the underlying research that relates these bacteria to various processes that can then affect the brain, as well as the various lifestyle factors that can be modified to enhance the health of these bacteria, and therefore translate into a better environment for brain health.   I can assure you, there is an abundance of research that is ongoing, exploring the powerful role of the microbiome in human illness. But what these researchers describe is the powerful relationship of the hundred trillion organisms that live within us in terms of our normal bodily function and even with the development of our organ systems.   They eloquently describe how the human microbiome first appears, meaning how we first colonize our gut by passage through the birth canal, and how these bacteria then pave the way for future colonization with healthy bacteria moving forward.   They then explore various modifiable factors that dramatically affect the gut bacteria and are associated with alterations of our physiology. They included a discussion of antibiotics, exercise and other lifestyle issues, diet, and even our obsession with hygiene.   The body of the article is certainly quite in-depth and scientific. But what is so striking is how the authors pursue the relationship of the microbiome not just to various medical conditions, but more importantly, in the actual production of human organs, the development of our immune systems, the function of our gastrointestinal systems, and a variety of other physiologic functions that really arent generally associated as yet with the bacteria that living within us.   As they state:   Research over the past decade has accumulated a large body of evidence linking alterations in the gut microbial composition to several diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease, asthma, arthritis, obesity and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, it is now clear that the normal intestinal microbiota also influences numerous physiological aspects in the healthy host, including organ morphogenesis, immune system and gastrointestinal tract development and maturation, intestinal vascularization, tissue regeneration, carcinogenesis, bone homeostasis, metabolism and behaviour.   This dramatically raises the importance of our understanding of the microbiome. Basically, this information is breathtaking and clearly serves as a harbinger for defining where science is going to take us in the future.   We live in a time when science is making great progress in developing cures for various illnesses. Unfortunately, at the same time, we are seen issues like Alzheimers disease and autism virtually exploding on the scene with no meaningful understanding about what can be done.   As these authors so clearly point out, the changes that are happening to the microbiome may well be associated with these and other unexplained diseases. They make it clear that we are modifying a fundamental control point in our most basic level of physiology. But rather then curse the darkness, lighting the single candle of hope should be what is taken away from this report. That is, we can change so many factors over which we have control to gain a more healthy, robust microbiome. This will no doubt enhance our chances of becoming more disease resistant, and in living a longer and healthier life.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/probiotic-prevents-adhd-autism/,"Right now in America more than 6 million children carry a diagnosis of ADHD. I think it is fair to say that autism has become an epidemic when you consider that, today, as many as 1 in 40 male births will ultimately be diagnosed as being on the autism spectrum.   So aside from hoping that effective treatments will be developed, theres no question that we have to wonder what may be causing these issues, and if that can be determined, what can be done to fix the problem. One thing that has been clearly supported in research is a relationship between what goes on in the gut and the development of neuropsychiatric disorders like these mentioned here. Bowel issues are common in ADHD and are seen almost universally in autistic children.   Certainly, front and center in research these days is the understanding that the gut bacteria, part of the human microbiome, plays a huge role in terms of brain health and function. As such, researchers in Finland decided to explore the possibility that changing the microbiome might be associated with a reduced risk for both ADHD and autism.   Their study,  published just last month in the journal Pediatric Research , evaluated 75 infants who were randomized to either receive a specific probiotic, Lactobacillus rhamnosus, or a placebo during the first six months of life. The study then followed these kids for the next 13 years.   At age 13 years, ADHD, or autistic spectrum, was diagnosed in 17.1% of the children in the placebo group and none in the group receiving the probiotic.   The conclusion of the study humbly stated:   probiotic supplementation early in life may reduce the risk of neuropsychiatric disorder development later in childhood   This is quite a study. The researchers were able to demonstrate that just receiving one specific species of a probiotic virtually eliminated the development of either ADHD or autistic spectrum in those children receiving this intervention. I would agree that further study is necessary, but even this preliminary study demonstrates the profound potential moving forward for actual medical utilization of a probiotic regimen to prevent a brain disorder.   Keep in mind that this study was begun 14 years ago at time when researchers were just beginning to get a taste of the importance of gut bacteria as they relate to the brain.

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/artificial-sweeteners-threaten-health/,"It seems self evident that consumption of sugar sweetened beverages would be associated with increased risk for type 2 diabetes (T2D). And in fact, this has been demonstrated in multiple studies. This is understandable when you consider what a powerful slug of fructose is delivered by each can or bottle of this stuff.   So it is that the term, sugar free is being exploited to death by soft drink manufacturers because of the mistaken public perception that choosing artificially sweetened drinks would be a healthier choice. It is a mistaken perception as now were seeing studies that have demonstrated that the risk for T2D is also dramatically increased in individuals who choose not to drink sugar sweetened beverages, but opt for those that contain artificial sweeteners.   In a recent report in the  American Journal of Clinical Nutrition , French researchers evaluated more than 66,000 women over a 14 year period and found that those who favored sugar sweetened beverages did in fact have an increased risk of T2D, by about 34%. Incredibly, those choosing artificially sweetened drinks had a risk increase for T2D that was more than twice what that amount.   In trying to explain this seemingly paradoxical finding, the authors speculated that artificially sweetened beverages, because they dont cause the body to secrete insulin, may therefore not stimulate the satiety response. This lack of appetite suppression may ultimately lead to increased calorie consumption in the form of other foods.   But now, other researchers may have identified a different mechanism relating consumption of artificial sweeteners and diabetes.  Israeli researchers recently demonstrated  that in both laboratory animals as well as humans, glucose intolerance (which sets the stage for full blown diabetes) is related to changes in the gut bacteria induced by artificial sweeteners. Consumption of these chemicals induces changes to the microbiome,  the collection of microbes and their genetic material that live within our bodies.   Keep in mind that it is the microbiome that helps regulate all manner of metabolism within the human body having a key role in determining how we handle sugar and carbs, how many calories are extracted from our foods, and even whether we feel hungry or satisfied. Beyond these functions, our gut bacteria even play a pivotal role in the regulation of chemicals that affect our mood from one moment to the next  the neurotransmitters.   So in this context, my advice is to refrain from artificial sweeteners as they represent a clear and present threat to your delicate and life supporting gut bacteria.   In my new book,  Brain Maker  The Power of Gut Microbes to Heal and Protect Your Brain  for Life , artificial sweeteners, antibiotics, chlorinated water, method of birth, and even food choices are some of the many factors that I explore in terms of their effects on the microbiome and how these changes affect general health as well as brain health, for better or worse.

David Perlmutter is a leader in this burgeoning field, and his new book,  Brain Maker,  is a landmark contribution.   Dale E. Bredesen, MD, professor and director of Alzheimers Disease Research, UCLA    Dr. Perlmutter engagingly explains the hope-generating power of the new gut microbiome-brain science, motivating you to regenerate your brain health with his powerful and practical program.   Martha Herbert, MD, Assistant Professor of Neurology,    Harvard Medical School   Dr. Perlmutters book is among those rare and exciting exceptions: information so empowering, so enlightening, and presented so clearly and concisely that the reader emerges far better off for the reading experience. Put this book on your short list of must-reads for health and nutrition.   William Davis, MD, author of  Wheat Belly   The single most important medical innovation in the 21st century is making the link between the gut and the little bugs that live there and nearly every chronic disease  from autism to depression, from asthma to autoimmune disease, from diabetes to dementia.  Brain Maker  is a game changer. For the first time, this brilliant scientist doctor connects the dots and teaches us why we need to tend our inner garden (our microbiome) and provides a radical but simple plan to reset, reboot, and renew your microbiome. This book shouldnt be called  Brain Maker , it should be called  Health Maker .

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/ken-j/,"Soon after my birthday celebration last September (I turned 47), a friend who had snapped a photo of me at that party posted that photo on my Facebook. In seeing my fairly overweight self in that picture, I committed to living a healthier lifestyle.  It will be the last photo like that anyone will see.   For most of my adult life I have  suffered issues with my ankles.  They would randomly swell up and no one could tell me why. Recently, a bone scan seemed to reveal that my cartilage has hooks and would get irritated. I lived with this problem for over 20 years. The first eight months of last year were particularly uncomfortable. My ankles, and sometimes my knees, would swell up and keep me from working. Many days I would go to work and just hobble around in pain.   Last August, while home from work due to my knee being swollen (for no clear reason), I felt I had to do something. I followed the advice of Monica Reinagel, the author of the The Inflammation Free Diet Plan , and my swelling went down immediately. Life was good. In October I started to exercise again because I felt that I had the inflammation under control.  My workout program recommended that I eliminate starch and sugar for 14 days. So I did. I was watching many YouTube videos and stumbled onto some information about Grain Brain. For some reason, the information grabbed my attention. I ended up purchasing the audiobook soon thereafter. I was captivated! It only took me three days to complete the book, and I was ready to take my health back into my own hands.   I was concerned what a low-carb diet would do to my energy levels. So I read  The Art and Science of Low Carbohydrate Performance , by Jeff Volek & Stephen Phinney.   The results of all this?  I have lost over 30 pounds! I have had no inflammation issues with my joints. I am so amazed! There were other aliments that also went away. For example, I used to have sore feet at the end of the day. I thought my feet were just tired. Well I guess they were a bit inflamed!   Grain Brain  has been instrumental to my health journey. I am immensely grateful that I found you. You introduced me to the idea of eating low-carb and high-fat. I have been living the ketogenic lifestyle now for over 3 months and feel the best I have in decades.   -Ken J.     Read Next   Sandy C. What I like about Sandy's store is the role her husband's aunt played. On both social media and this website, I always talk about the important of sharing this information with others. The reason why is because I want to facilitate more stories like Sandy's. - Dr. Perlmutter I am January 17, 2014 In ""Success"" William W. It's so nice to read about someone who has a renewed thirst, and excitement, for life because of these changes. - Dr. Perlmutter. Over the last decade, I developed severe anxiety and depression. I slowly watched my love of life, family, and friends, my state of mind, my career, and April 8, 2014 In ""Success"" Jessica L. Jessica's story is truly inspiring. Her battle back to better health is the kind of empowerment I hope to facilitate with Grain Brain. Adopting a Grain Brain-friendly lifestyle not only gave Jessica back control of her health, but her entire life. - Dr. Perlmutter As a travel writer with a November 1, 2013 In ""Success"""

",http://www.drperlmutter.com/learn/resources/drugs-that-deplete-b-vitamins/,"B vitamins are your best protection against elevated levels of homocysteine, an amino acid produced in the body that in excess, can increase your risk of mood disorders, poor mental performance, and Alzheimers disease.   A wide range of drugs, from aspirin to estrogen to diuretics to stomach acid suppressors (such as Nexium and Prilosec) can interfere with the metabolism of one or more B vitamins, which can result in elevated levels of homocysteine. You who are worried about preserving your brain power, take note: medical research now clearly links poor performance on mental function tests to elevated homocysteine levels. Having too much of this amino acid floating around in your bloodstream can cost you a few IQ points! B vitamins are also critical for mood and concentration, and a severe deficiency in B vitamins (especially vitamin B12 can result in symptoms such as severe confusion and mental fog at any age. Elevated levels of homocysteine and/or low levels of B vitamins can also increase the risk of depression, stroke, Alzheimers disease, vascular dementia, heart disease, and even certain types of cancer. If you are using a drug that depletes your body of B vitamins, you must take supplemental B vitamins daily and demand to have your homocysteine levels checked periodically by your doctor.

Joining the long-separated worlds of science and spirit, Perlmutter explores the exciting phenomena of neurogenesis and mitochondrial health, while Villoldo brings his vast knowledge of shamanic and spiritual practices to the table. Together they draw from the most powerful tools in each discipline to create the Power Up Your Brain program, a ground-breaking, five-week plan that helps prime the brain for enlightenment. With nutritional advice, dietary supplements, physical exercise, shamanic practices, meditation, and visualizations, Perlmutter and Villoldo guide readers, step by step, through a program to help them clear their minds from previous trauma and open themselves up to experience the inner peace, vast insight, and extraordinary creativity that define the experience of enlightenment, paving the way to successfully face the challenges to come."

Dr. Perlmutter   11 years ago, in my third trimester of pregnancy, I developed itchy skin  that made my life all but unbearable. I did neither marks nor welts on my skin. I considered myself lucky when hives would show so people didnt think I was totally crazy.   I saw my GP, dermatologists, and of course a psychiatrist. I was prescribed Effexor, Adavan, Xanax. Nothing helped the itch, and I knew these drugs were not what I needed. I wasnt crazy or depressed. I was crazy and depressed because my skin felt like it was on fire, and no one could help me! For years, I endured this itch.   Over the years my digestive symptoms became awful  and I knew something was going on with my body. Fear, money, and trust issues kept from going to the doctor. I didnt want a pill.I have searched the internet for many years to my answer, and this year, stumbled upon a list of gluten-sensitivity symptoms via the internet. Finally!   I have been gluten free since May and rarely itch anymore. I want to thank Dr. Perlmutter for writing Grain Brain because when a doctor says something, people listen.
