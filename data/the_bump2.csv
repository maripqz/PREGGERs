After a sleep-deprived night and exhausting day of tending to babys every need, youll feel like you hit gold when you open the freezer and see it stocked with delicious, homemade, heat-and-eat meals. Soups, stews, casseroles, lasagna, and pasta sauces are best for freezing. Meals can be stored in the freezer for up to three months before they spoil or before flavors are affected.*Food-Freezing Tips:*The nemesis of frozen food is oxygen. If youre freezing something in a bag, get rid of excess air before sealing it. If youre using a plastic container, make sure it has a tight-fitting lid and use the smallest size that will fit what youre freezingUse freezer zip-top bags. You may end up with freezer burn if you use sandwich-style bags  they are too thin.Freeze in single or double portions and use freezer zip-top bags. It saves room in your freezer, makes for quick thawing (just submerge item in hot water), and lets you defrost only what you need.If you arent sure how best to freeze a certain item (or long it will keep), check the National Center for Home Food Preservationwebsite.Freezer-Friendly Recipes:12 Make-Ahead Freezer Meals for Moms-to-beHere are some more of our favorite healthy and hearty, freezer-ready meals from The Nest:Turkey ChiliHealthiest-Ever LasagnaBaked Pasta with Roasted Wild Mushrooms in a Creamy Thyme Sauce  AdvertisementZesty Beef CasseroleSquash StewFind more recipes from The Nest.*Updated 10/27/2011Related Video"

"How to Make One ', <b>Meal</b>, u' for the Whole Family",http://www.thebump.com/a/double-duty-baby-food,"About a year ago, when my son Archie started eating solids, I was excited about introducing him to a whole new world of foods. I like to cook, and imagined hanging out with Archie as he experienced his first tastes of everything from apples to curry. But every book I found on cooking for kids assumed that things like taste and fun were irrelevant to babies and toddlers.That seemed wrong-headed to me, so I scrapped the books and started making my own concoctions, eventually coming to the common-sense realization that with a few small modifications he could eat the same foods as us  right from the start.Not only would that  hopefully  keep him from being one of those kids who only eats pasta and cheese, it would save me the time in the kitchen, and likely improve all our diets to boot!After experimenting on my own for a while, I called up my chef pal Marisol and asked her advice on recipes that could do double-duty. Together, we came up with some simple tips for making the most of your of your meals  for mama, and baby.Tip #1: Don't Be Afraid of Herbs and SpicesPediatricians tend to discourage adding much, if any, salt or sugar to baby food. Why? Going from breast milk, which has the least sweet of the sugars, to processed food with corn syrup or even stevia, its possible that your child will always reach out for sweeter foods, says Dr. Jatinder Bhatia, Chief of Neonatology at Childrens Hospital of Georgia and Georgia Regents University in Augusta, Ga., and the current chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition. We really try to encourage people to make their own foods so we can address children's sugar and salt intake early on.  AdvertisementCooking from scratch gives you control here. But that doesn't mean baby food has to be bland! Babies can handle all kinds of herbs and spices, and introducing them early on will make them more open to trying new tastes as they grow.Not sure where to start? Try adding thyme to carrot purees, cinnamon to sweet potatoes or butternut squash, and curry or garlic to pureed kale or chard. Herbs and spices not only help keep things interesting for baby, but can also offer a health boost. Ginger will help when they have a stomach bug, says Dr. Amy Maidenberg, pediatrician and owner of Sage Pediatrics in Oakland, Calif. And garlic has known immune benefits. I tend to recommend using all the herbs and spices you can, in moderation. The more variety, the better.Tip #2: Maximize Your OptionsNo time to hit the grocery store? No worries. Dont fret about cilantro when parsley will do just fine. Just because a recipe calls for a certain ingredient, doesnt mean you must use it. Many fruits and vegetables have multiple varieties  and most have easy swaps, in terms of taste and health benefits.So use what works, depending on the season, whats in the fridge and what baby (and you, of course) love to eat.Remember: you can cook the same recipe any number of different ways. If a recipe calls for sweet potatoes, but it's squash season, for example, try substituting butternut. Similarly, if your baby doesn't seem to like one particular type of sweet potato, try others (purple-skinned sweet potatoes tend to be starchier and less sweet, while the orange-red skinned varieties tend to be sweeter). Texture and flavor can vary wildly between different varietals of the same fruit or vegetable, and those changes can make the difference between a puree your baby loves and one he or she spits out every time.  AdvertisementTip # 3: Be PreparedWhichever fruits and veggies your family likes, keep an assortment of them on hand. I like to roast a pan of mixed vegetables every week  handy for easy purees and salads. Keep a couple of baskets of berries around to grab for a snack or puree for a healthy addition to yogurt or oatmeal.Also, stocking the pantry with easy go-tos makes life simpler on busy weekdays. Make and freeze chicken stock  or stash some of your favorite by your favorite low-sodium organic brand  for easy sauces. Keep a variety of whole grains and pastas on hand for quick fixes. Learn what works best for your clan, then keep those go-to staples within easy reach.Tip #4: Sneak Veggies in EverywhereEven the best little eater will suddenly decide at some point that they don't like this or that. The smart-mom solution? Learn how to sneak in veggies wherever you can. Mix chard and kale into the dough for homemade veggie pasta, blend greens with apple juice for a super-healthy and tasty smoothie, mold veggie mashes into balls or small patties that can be flash fried in olive oil and easily grabbed by chubby little hands.Tip #5: If You Eat Meat, They Eat MeatIf you're not a vegetarian, and you plan on serving your child meat at some point, it's a good idea to start early. ""I'm a big fan of iron-rich foods early on, so I recommend sardines or liver as one of the first five foods my patients try, unless they're vegetarian,"" Dr. Maidenberg says. Concerned about baby's ability to chew and swallow meat? Go for easy-to-puree options and gradually work your way up as baby gets more teeth.  AdvertisementTip #6: Help Them Help YouAs early as 9 months, most babies want to start feeding themselves. And once that urge kicks in, don't fight it, embrace it! But forget spoon-feeding  finger foods are where its at. Luckily, many of the foods you've given them early on can be transformed into handy snackers with a little ingenuity. Pureed carrots easily transform into bite-sized munchies, and apple sauce converts to sturdier slices when babys ready.The good news: the more things baby can feed himself, the longer he'll be willing to sit in a highchair or booster seat. The added bonus? Many finger foods can come along in the car, too, without too much mess or fuss._Looking formeal ideasfor the whole family?

"What Is The Six-', <b>Meal</b>, u' Solution?",https://www.thebump.com/a/six-meal-solution,"Three square meals might have been the lesson of the day when you were in grade school, but now that youre all grown up  and eating for two  you may find that number just doesnt work. Some experts think eating smaller, more frequent meals (specifically, five or six mini meals instead of the old breakfast, lunch and dinner) can help alleviate some of the discomforts of pregnancy, including nausea, gas, bloating, constipation, headaches and fatigue. These mini meals can help keep your blood sugar levels stable, so youre not facing big peaks and valleys (of energy and mood!) that can come with bigger meals. And since youre already adding an extra 300 calories a day to help support your babys growth (about twice that if youre carrying twins), you can take advantage of these extra eating opportunities. Remember that your baby gets the nutrients he needs first, so make sure those mini meals are healthy ones, with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean protein to support his growth.Plus More From The Bump:Your Pregnancy DietGuidelines To Eating Right While PregnantIs Exercise Safe During Pregnancy?Related Video"

Your Pregnancy Diet: A Starter's Shopping List,https://www.thebump.com/a/your-pregnancy-diet-a-starters-shopping-list,"Now that youre pregnant, your overall diet needs to be well-balanced to ensure that you and baby get the right amount of vitamins and minerals. A little overwhelmed by all the eat this, not that advice youve been getting lately? We dont blame you. So lets make things simple: Heres a cheat sheet of what to add to your shopping list (if they arent on it already) the next time youre cruising the grocery aisles:The Basics Whole grains Whole wheat bread Brown rice Bran cereal Black beans Lentils Lima beans Chickpeas Citrus fruit Broccoli Tomatoes Spinach Kale Sweet Potatoes SquashEating lots of different-colored fruits and veggies will help you get in an array of vitamins and minerals. Citrus fruits, broccoli and tomatoes are good sources of vitamin C, which will promote healthy skin and gums, among other things. Dark, leafy greens are a great way to get in the vitamin A, folate and iron that you need during pregnancy and breastfeeding. Sweet potatoes and squash are high in fiber and rich in vitamins A and C and make a great choice for a nutritious side dish or as ingredients in soups and casseroles. Spinach is also a good source of iron. Now that extra blood is circulating in your body, youll need to get more iron in your diet so you dont become anemic. Plus, opting for veggies and whole grains that are high in fiber will keep you feeling full. They're also low in fat and help alleviate constipation. Foods that are high in folic acidlike spinach, lentils, chickpeas and morewill also help develop babys nervous system.  AdvertisementProteinSince protein is one of the essential building blocks for muscle, tissue, and all sorts of other new cells, getting the required amount is crucial when youre pregnant. (Its also important after pregnancy, when youre exercising and trying to build up new muscle.) Browse this list of options to make sure youre working enough protein into your diet each day: Organic chicken Turkey (fresh, not deli meat) Beef Lamb Veal Liver Ham Wild salmon Milk Yogurt Soy milk Tofu Pasteurized cheese Eggs In addition to protein, dairy offers up calcium, which helps build bones and strong muscles. If you dont consume enough, babys bones steal calcium from yours, which ups your risk of osteoporosis later in life. You can look for brands of yogurt that are fortified with folic acid and Vitamin D. Vegetarian RecommendationsIf youre a vegetarian, youll want to pay extra attention to the amount of protein youre getting at every meal (consider popping a vitamin B12 supplement each day too). Try incorporating as many of these veggie-friendly foods in your diet as possible: Legumes Black beans Navy beans Pinto beans Peas Soybeans Tofu Tempeh Whole grains Natural peanut butter Flaxseed Olive oilFlaxseed, while rich in protein, is also a good source of DHA (also found in salmon, wheat germ and nuts), which is crucial during pregnancy in helping baby's brain, cells, and retinal, nervous and cardiovascular systems develop properly.

How Much Solid Food Should Baby Eat? Bonnie Vengrow ...,https://www.thebump.com/a/how-much-solids-to-feed-baby,"When you start feeding baby solids  usually around four to six months  start small. One to two ounces of food per meal is totally fine, says Satya Narisety, assistant professor in the Department of Pediatrics at Rutgers University. Follow babys cues. If hes showing hes not into it by keeping his lips closed or by turning away, hes had enough. Gradually increase the amount of food to about four ounces, three times a day by the end of his sixth month.At eight months, bump up the amount of solids to six to eight ounces per meal, three times a day, with two two-ounce snacks in between, Narisety says.Remember: Baby still gets most of his nutrition from breast milk or formula. If youre nursing, continue breastfeeding five to seven times a day (depending on how much baby takes in at each feeding  you'll have to follow his cues). If youre bottle-feeding, aim to give 24 ounces of milk in a 24-hour period by the time hes eight months of age.

"Q&A: Eating Right During Pregnancy? Denise Gershwin, CNM ...",http://www.thebump.com/a/eating-right-during-pregnancy,"Good nutrition during pregnancy is essential the nutrients you give your body are the building blocks of strong, healthy growth for baby. During the next nine months, you'll need about 300 more calories perday than usual. The best way to get these in is by sneaking in two or three healthy snacks between three small meals. Eating frequent small meals (as opposed to a few large meals separated by long period without calories or nutrients) help baby get maximum benefit from what you eat. Here are a few more ways to give baby a healthy start (and keep yourself comfortable):[] Drink eight to ten glasses (80-100 oz) of water each day[] Pick fruits, vegetables and whole grains, which are healthy and prevent constipation[] Eat high iron foods such as liver, shellfish,lean meat, poultry, fish, dried beans, green leafy vegetables and whole graincereals and breads[] Choose whole grains over sugar cereals and whitebread[ ] Avoid excessive caffeine (found in most sodas, coffee,tea, chocolate)[] Don't skip meals  even if you don't feelhungry, baby needs the nourishment[] Use our prenatal nutrition checklist to keep track of food groups and servings every dayRelated Video"
"Your Biggest ', <b>Meal</b>, u' Should Be Breakfast If You Want To Get Pregnant",https://www.thebump.com/a/your-biggest-meal-should-be-breakfast-if-you-want-to-get-pregnant,"While previous studies have hinted that eating like a Greek might help you conceive, there's one thing we can all agree on (feta-lover or otherwise): A hearty, healthy breakfast is more important than you would have ever thought. Sure, you'll need your nutrients and vitamins to power through the day, but did you ever think that tucking in for a big breakfast could actually help you conceive? Oh yeah, it can.The latest research reveals that eating a good breakfast has a positive impact on women struggling with infertility. Researchers at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv University found that a big breakfast increases fertility amongst women that suffer from irregular periods.The study set out to understand whether meal times have an impact on the health of a woman with irregular periods due to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome. Currently, PCOS affects 6 to 10 percent of women. So researchers followed 60 women aged 25 to 39 over a 12-week period. Each of the women suffered from PCOS and had a body mass index (BMI) of less than 23.From there, researchers led by Professor Oren Froy, Professor Daniela Jocabovitz and Dr. Julio Weinstein divided the women into two groups; each was allowed to consume 1,800 calories a day. The only difference between the two groups was when the women at their biggest meal. 30 of the women ate their biggest meal at breakfast while the remaining 30 ate theirs at dinner.Here's what they found:Women who ate their biggest meal at breakfast had decreased glucose and insulin levels (down by 8 percent), compared to the diner group who showed levels that remained virtually the unchanged. Also in the breakfast group, researchers noted that testosterone levels were down by nearly 50 percent. But the most telling was that women were ovulating at a much higher rate when they had their biggest meal at breakfast.  AdvertisementOf the findings, Froy said that the research ""clearly demonstrates that indeed the amount of calories we consume daily is very important, but the timing as to when we consume them is even more important.""Do you think it's important to eat a healthier, bigger breakfast?PHOTO:Thinkstock / The BumpRelated Video"
6 No-Stress Tips For Eating Out With Baby Erin van Vuuren,https://www.thebump.com/a/eating-out-with-baby,"There's no reason to leave baby behind for a family meal on the townwell, if you have the right game plan, that is. Check out these pointers from Tammy Gold, founder of Gold Parent Coaching, and you and baby will be enjoying your favorite restaurant together in no time.1. Mentally prepFirst things first, know what you're getting into. The key to a smooth dinner is parent prep, says Gold. Decide what your child is ready for, anticipate what could happen (tantrum, diaper explosion), determine how to prevent it and consider what you'll do if it happens anyway. Just thinking about how you'll handle these little blips is really half the battle.2. Pick the right locationLook for places with lots of space to walk around, says Gold. This way, you can take a tour of the place before the meal, and maybe a tour while you're waiting for the food. Keeping baby engaged and moving around can really help blow off some steam and keep him from getting bored (i.e. cranky). Look for venues with some interesting distractions toomaybe theres a large painting or an aquarium in the restaurant. A playground across the street? Even better. Definitely stay away from places with dim lights and fine crystal. No time to scope it out ahead of time? Call to see if they offer high chairs or boosters. If not, that's your sign that they probably aren't used to tiny patrons.3. Time it wellHungry babies are rarely happy, so definitely work within your child's schedule. If it's not possible to actually eat during baby's mealtime, Gold recommends feeding him at home and then bringing along a snack as a distraction. If dinner will last through bedtime, consider pulling the stroller right up to the table, and don't forget any blankies or other bedtime soothers. Try not to make plans that will keep you out late, though. A 1-year-old can't go out to dinner at nine, she says.  Advertisement4. Bring toysMost importantly, Gold suggests bringing along a special stock of restaurant-only toysnovel goodies that baby doesn't get to play with at home or in the car. Boredom is the biggest trigger of tantrums and bad behavior, Gold says, explaining that baby's amusement is all up to you. If their needs are met, you can meet yours. And tactile stimulation is best. Go for small, sturdy books and items with bright colors. The real trick, though, is to reserve your ammo. If you have 15 toys and present them all at once, you won't get very far, says Gold. Instead, give one at a time, maximizing your time and baby's attention span. Make the most of the tools you've got, and you might even make it to dessert.5. Set it upBe sure to clear away any dangerous items from the table and anything that baby might grab and hurl. Also, take notice of built-in toys (especially if your own stash is skimpy). Gold is a strong believer in the power of a few empty plastic cups and says that plastic spoons and jelly packets work great too. For older babies, you can make eating a hands-on project. Cut up the food. Let them hold it. Let them dip it in the ketchup. These are all ways to lengthen their ability to engage, she says. And, for the actual seating arrangements, bring along a backup in case the high chairs are all taken. Chicco's 360 Rotating Hook-On Booster Chair is a great portable option that lets baby face the table to eat or face outward to interact with you, the Stokke Xplory stroller lifts right up to table height and the Kaboost portable high chair booster raises a toddler's restaurant chair to grownup level.  Advertisement6. Go with itKeeping baby at bay is seriously an art. The key is to engage, engage, engageand then you can have your freedom, says Gold. In other words, if baby keeps busy, you can do more eating and chattingand less retrieving of the sippy cup from three booths over. And if it's just not working out? Hey, you tried. It can take some serious practice to learn what works best to keep your child engaged and happy. It might not go the way you planned this time. Or next time, Gold admits. But you'll get it. And about all those squished fries under the table? Don't forget to tip your server.PHOTO:ShutterstockRelated Video"
7 Smart Ways to Lose Weight While Breastfeeding,https://www.thebump.com/a/lose-weight-breastfeeding,"There are a lot of misconceptions out there about weight loss and breastfeeding, says Jennifer Ritchie, IBCLC and author of I Make MilkWhats Your Superpower? Some people believe that the weight just drops off if youre breastfeeding. Others think its hard to get your body back while youre breastfeeding.Neither is exactly right. Breastfeeding does burn extra calories  approximately 850 calories a day, to be exact. (Wow!) But losing weight while breastfeeding is rarely a given because breastfeeding makes moms hungrier. And hungry, sleep-deprived new moms tend to satisfy their cravings with simple carbohydrates  it's not exactly easy to lose weight when youre eating those.When normal, healthy adults are sleep deprived, they typically increase their carbohydrate consumption to make up for the lack of sleep, Ritchie explains. We end up reaching for the cookies.Dont pressure yourselfSorry, but you wont be stepping into your pre-pregnancy jeans right away. And trying to put them on in the early weeks will just be discouraging. In order to deliver a baby, everything in the body expands, Ritchie says. Your hips expand, your ribcage expands. It took a good nine months to put that weight on, so give yourself at least nine months to get it off and get your body back.Just ignore the excess weight for at least the first two weeks after birth. Honestly, the first two weeks of having an infant can be a nightmare. Its like boot camp, Ritchie says. For that time, focus on your baby, and dont worry about dieting.  AdvertisementAnd actually, you might want to wait six weeks or even longer before actively trying to lose the weight. Those entire first six weeks are a transitional period, Ritchie explains. It takes about that long for baby to adapt to the rhythms of the outside world, and for both baby and mom to get a hang of breastfeeding. You dont need the outside distraction of a rigid diet or exercise plan.Make savvy substitutionsThink before you snack. Instead of reaching for the Doritos, pop some popcorn. Instead of having packaged cereal, make a batch of steel-cut oatmeal. Oatmeal is a great breakfast for a breastfeeding mom whos trying to lose weight. It keeps you full for a long period of time and keeps insulin levels stable, Ritchie says.Starchy veggies, such as baked potatoes and sweet potatoes, can also satisfy your craving for carbs. Brown and wild rice are good side dish and snack options, too.Set yourself up for successA little bit of prep work one day can help you keep your eating on track for the next few days. Cut up some veggies and fruit to keep in the fridge, cook and freeze healthy meals for later quick defrosting, and dont feel bad about grabbing steam-in-bag veggies or other healthy low-prep snacks (there are lots of options at Trader Joes!). The idea is to keep healthy snacks and meals in the cabinet and fridge, and to keep out the Girl Scout cookies and chips, Ritchie says.Eat smaller, more frequent meals  AdvertisementIf a mom waits too long between meals, theres a hormonal effect that affects milk supply, Ritchie says. Her body will start pulling energy from her reserves, which decreases insulin production and affects thyroid hormone levels. That lowers prolactin, which is the hormone that controls how much milk we make. When youre feeling starving, youre more likely to eat something you know you shouldnt. Instead, spread your calories out over six mini-meals throughout the day.Cut calories  but not too muchIts perfectly safe to diet while breastfeeding, as long as your total caloric intake doesnt dip below 1,800 calories per day and you keep eating a wide variety of nutritious foods.Work in exerciseWait at least six to eight weeks before starting or restarting a serious exercise regimen. If youre planning a particularly strenuous workout, eat a healthy carb about a half-hour before you exercise. Eating a starchy vegetable, like half of a baked potato, before running can really help prevent a decrease in your milk supply, Ritchie says.Keep at itEveryone loses weight at a different rate, so dont be discouraged if your weight loss happens more slowly than it does for all those celeb mamas. With a healthy diet plan, breastfeeding moms typically lose about a pound a week, says Ritchie.The cool thing is, you can tailor your plan to your lifestyle and whether youd rather cut more calories or do more exercise. As long as youre burning more calories than youre consuming, youll lose weight, Ritchie says. So if a mom decides she wants to be able to eat the foods that she loves, she can add in some extra walks with the baby.

"6 Thanksgiving Foods That Make Great ', <b>Meals</b>, u' for Baby",https://www.thebump.com/a/6-thanksgiving-foods-that-make-great-meals-for-baby,"It's Thanksgiving time! Of course, you want to involve baby in the festivities, so if you're considering letting her try a little bit of your special meal, go for it! There are some Thanksgiving foods that make perfect baby purees and finger foods. (Tip: Of course, only give these to your baby if she's started on solids and you know she's ready for these particular foods.)Sweet potatoesCooked sweet potatoes are easy to mash, and they're rich in beta-carotene, which is good for baby's vision, skin, growth and immune system.TurkeyYup, believe it or not, many pediatricians are now recommending introducing meats into baby's diet fairly early (ask yours). Turkey is rich in protein and iron (if it's dark meat). It can be pureed with a little water or fruit, or chopped into teeny pieces for a toddler who's already a good chewer.PumpkinBefore you fill your pie, put aside some pumpkin for baby. It's rich in beta carotene and has protein and potassium too. Ideally, you want to use fresh pumpkin to bake and puree for baby, but if you're getting it out of a can, that's fine too. Just double check that you're not giving her ""pumpkin pie mix,"" which can have added sugar, starch and other stuff you probably don't want her to have.ApplesSame goes if you're making an apple pie! Apples pack punches of vitamin C and fiber, and they taste great too! Bake some apples for baby and make them into applesauce. Most doctors will agree they're great as one of baby's first solid foods.  AdvertisementGreen beansAnother food approved for early eaters is green beansgood news if you're already stocking up for a casserole. These greens have vitamin C, iron, potassium, calcium and more. They're also easy to prepare: just steam and then puree (just make sure the skins get completely mushed upthey can be stubborn!).SquashButternut and acorn squashes are two of our favorite baby foods. Cut them in half, bake, scoop and puree (or cut into pieces, if your kid is older). They make the house smell amazing! Plus, they've got fiber, protein, potassium and calcium.Updated November 2016PHOTO:iStockRelated Video"

Healthy Foods For Busy Moms-To-Be,https://www.thebump.com/a/healthy-foods-for-busy-moms-to-be,"Between hectic work schedules, family obligations, and the normal stresses of everyday life, its hard for most of us to always eat healthy when were so busy  pregnant or not. But for moms-to-be, its especially important to get in adequate nutrition during their pregnancy. Read on for easy ways to integrate nutrient-dense power meals in your day that will satisfy your hunger and keep you (and baby) healthy.BreakfastSure, youve heard it a million times: Breakfasts the most important meal of the day. But just why is it so important? Not only does it set the tone for metabolic function, skipping out on it will probably leave you cranky and tired earlier in the day. Not a fan of a big breakfast? Go light. Try some fresh seasonal fruit and yogurt, topped off with chopped organic nuts and seeds. The nuts and seeds will slow down the burn of the fruits sugars. If morning sickness is really getting to you during the first two trimesters, boost your diet with high-protein snacks. Make a bowl of oatmeal and stir in flaxseed or hemp seeds, cinnamon, and your choice of a light sweetener (like maple syrup, agave nectar, or honey).Mid-morning snacksKeeping food on hand when you need a quick bite to eat will prevent you from impulsively buying higher-calorie foods and will probably save you cash in the long-run. Buy healthy trail mix or try making your own at home  just get some mixed nuts and seeds of your choice, add in some dried fruit, and store it in portable, reusable containers. Nut and seed butter are other great sources of protein; try packing an apple and spread some almond, cashew, or pumpkin seed butter on it. (Pretty tasty!) Not only are nuts and seeds high in protein, theyre also high in zinc. Youll want to pay attention to zinc levels if morning sickness has been really plaguing you, since the mineral is known to stave off nausea. Not into nuts? Having sliced veggies with a bean spread, like hummus, is also a great snack option.  AdvertisementLunchWhen youre busy, lunch is the perfect time to have an all-in-one meal, since you can pack a variety of nutrients and flavors into a simple wrap or sandwich. For example, a wrap with beans, cucumbers, tomatoes, avocado, and arugula, topped off with a nice pesto or tapenade is a great way to get a yummy and balanced one-dish meal. (Tip: Unless you have access to a fridge, be cautious about packing any meat protein for lunch.)Afternoon snacksIts always important to stick to a diet that contains enough high-quality fats during pregnancy. So use your afternoon snack to do this  just keep an eye on your portion size. A serving of marinated olives is a great way to be sure youre getting in some good fats, but it also boosts your good cholesterol. In the mood for something sweeter? Try an acai and blueberry smoothie (check out the recipe below). Acai is chock full of antioxidants, omega 3s and 6s, and protein. It also gets bonus points for being a fatty fruit that wont pack the pounds. You can make the smoothie at home or buy it packaged and take it to-go.Recipe: Acai & Blueberry Protein SmoothieAcai is an Amazonian super-berry touted for its nutritional benefits. This berry duo offers a unique blend of antioxidants, and the omega fatty acids in the Acai make it a complete protein.

Healthy Foods For Busy Moms-To-Be,https://www.thebump.com/a/healthy-foods-for-busy-moms-to-be,"Between hectic work schedules, family obligations, and the normal stresses of everyday life, its hard for most of us to always eat healthy when were so busy  pregnant or not. But for moms-to-be, its especially important to get in adequate nutrition during their pregnancy. Read on for easy ways to integrate nutrient-dense power meals in your day that will satisfy your hunger and keep you (and baby) healthy.BreakfastSure, youve heard it a million times: Breakfasts the most important meal of the day. But just why is it so important? Not only does it set the tone for metabolic function, skipping out on it will probably leave you cranky and tired earlier in the day. Not a fan of a big breakfast? Go light. Try some fresh seasonal fruit and yogurt, topped off with chopped organic nuts and seeds. The nuts and seeds will slow down the burn of the fruits sugars. If morning sickness is really getting to you during the first two trimesters, boost your diet with high-protein snacks. Make a bowl of oatmeal and stir in flaxseed or hemp seeds, cinnamon, and your choice of a light sweetener (like maple syrup, agave nectar, or honey).Mid-morning snacksKeeping food on hand when you need a quick bite to eat will prevent you from impulsively buying higher-calorie foods and will probably save you cash in the long-run. Buy healthy trail mix or try making your own at home  just get some mixed nuts and seeds of your choice, add in some dried fruit, and store it in portable, reusable containers. Nut and seed butter are other great sources of protein; try packing an apple and spread some almond, cashew, or pumpkin seed butter on it. (Pretty tasty!) Not only are nuts and seeds high in protein, theyre also high in zinc. Youll want to pay attention to zinc levels if morning sickness has been really plaguing you, since the mineral is known to stave off nausea. Not into nuts? Having sliced veggies with a bean spread, like hummus, is also a great snack option.  AdvertisementLunchWhen youre busy, lunch is the perfect time to have an all-in-one meal, since you can pack a variety of nutrients and flavors into a simple wrap or sandwich. For example, a wrap with beans, cucumbers, tomatoes, avocado, and arugula, topped off with a nice pesto or tapenade is a great way to get a yummy and balanced one-dish meal. (Tip: Unless you have access to a fridge, be cautious about packing any meat protein for lunch.)Afternoon snacksIts always important to stick to a diet that contains enough high-quality fats during pregnancy. So use your afternoon snack to do this  just keep an eye on your portion size. A serving of marinated olives is a great way to be sure youre getting in some good fats, but it also boosts your good cholesterol. In the mood for something sweeter? Try an acai and blueberry smoothie (check out the recipe below). Acai is chock full of antioxidants, omega 3s and 6s, and protein. It also gets bonus points for being a fatty fruit that wont pack the pounds. You can make the smoothie at home or buy it packaged and take it to-go.Recipe: Acai & Blueberry Protein SmoothieAcai is an Amazonian super-berry touted for its nutritional benefits. This berry duo offers a unique blend of antioxidants, and the omega fatty acids in the Acai make it a complete protein. With a teaspoon of powerful little chia seeds or 1 tablespoon hemp powder for an added protein kick, this energy-packed smoothie will surely become one of your favorites  babies love it too! You can find Sambazon Acai in the frozen fruit section of your grocery store.

"Kate Middleton's "", <b>Meal</b>, u'-Prepping Crash Course: What Moms-to-Be ...",https://www.thebump.com/news/kate-middletons-meal-prepping-crash-course-what-moms-to-be-can-make-ahead-before-baby-arrives,"As our girl's due date draws nearer and nearer, it's no surprise to see that Kate Middleton has started nesting! The Duchess was spotted a few weeks ago shopping for decor for her home with Prince William. But lately, rumor has it that the Duchess of Cambridge has been taking cooking classes from the newest royal housekeeper, Antonella Fresolone. Before joining Kate and Will's staff, Antonella worked at Buckingham Palace (where she was well-know for her Italian cooking) but now, she's got a new home with the Prince and his leading lady.Currently, it seems that Antonella has her hands full teaching Kate the lay of the kitchen land  and apparently she's teaching the mama-to-be how to whip up ""a number of new dishes."" While I love that Kate's in the kitchen cooking up a storm, in just a few months Kate's attention will be directed elsewhere  you know, to the very royal arrival of her very royal baby. Since her cooking might take a back seat while she and Will adjust to love with a plus one (will it be a boy? A girl? Y'all, the anticipation is killing me!), it'll be good for Kate to know that there's a whole laundry list of recipes she can cook ahead of time and freeze before baby arrives! Even on the occasions that said royal baby is snoozing through dinner (or if he's eating!), Kate and Will won't have to forage for food  they'll have it ready to go, right in their freezer.  AdvertisementSo Kate, if you're listening, squirreling away some precooked meals in your freezer before baby arrives will cut down on some of the stress (and take-out!) during your first weeks as a parent. (Not like we're worried about you running up the tab on the royal bill, but still, it's nice to know you're eating a meal you've prepared. Less wait time, too!) After a sleep-deprived night and exhausting day of tending to babys every need, youll feel like you hit gold when you open the freezer and see it stocked with delicious, homemade, heat-and-eat meals. Soups, stews, casseroles, lasagna, and pasta sauces are best for freezing. Dishes like turkey chili, lasagna, baked pasta with mushrooms, beef casserole and squash soup make great dinner dishes, as well as double batches of household favorites like: marinara sauce, macaroni and cheese, bean and cheese enchiladas, and even freezing grilled chicken works wonders! You can just add them to whatever you're cooking and boom, protein provided! Since Kate's latest reported craving was for curry, we recommend scoping out a few Thai-inspired meals that mama-to-be can also made ahead. Many of the sauces can be made in bulk, just the same way double batches of marinara go.Meals can be stored in the freezer for up to three months before they spoil or before flavors are affected.Here's what you need to know before stocking up:The nemesis of frozen food is oxygen. If youre freezing something in a bag, get rid of excess air before sealing it. If youre using a plastic container, make sure it has a tight-fitting lid and use the smallest size that will fit what youre freezingUse freezer zip-top bags. You may end up with freezer burn if you use sandwich-style bags  they are too thin.Freeze in single or double portions and use freezer zip-top bags. It saves room in your freezer, makes for quick thawing (just submerge item in hot water), and lets you defrost only what you need.What meals did you freeze before baby arrived?PHOTO:Getty Images / The BumpRelated Video"

"Easy (and Kid-Friendly!), Beef Weeknight ', <b>Meals</b",https://www.thebump.com/a/easy-and-kid-friendly-beef-weeknight-meals,"Are you a working mom who wants some easy meals under your belt? Are you a stay-at-home mom who doesn't have a bunch of time (or hands!) available to make dinner? No matter your situation, we all want to have some easy meals at our disposal. Here are some meal ideas for you that are centered around hamburger. (See my other post on meal ideas involving chicken.) Since many of these use browned beef, you could easily brown all the hamburger at the same time, reserving some for later use. Mess up 1 pan and get many meals out of it!Meal Idea #1: Simple Macaroni and Beef with CheeseSlightly Adapted from Michael RuhlmanServings: 4-6 (easily)Tip: This is very easy to pull together or to make on the weekend and then pop in the oven when ready to bake. If you do bake it straight from the frig, you'll want to increase the baking time since it isn't starting from room temperature. Check the source for instructions on freezing  this is very freezer friendly!Ingredients: 1 large onion, diced 1 tablespoon canola oil salt to taste optional seasonings: black pepper, oregano, cumin, coriander, chopped garlic, hot smoked paprika, chilli powderwhatever youre in the mood for 28 ounces can tomatoes, petite diced or crushed 2 pounds lean ground beef 1 box macaroni 1 cup each grated cheddar and mozzarella cheesesDirections:Cook the onions with the oil and a little salt.Add the beef and cook it, breaking it up as you do. Add the seasonings that you've chosen.  AdvertisementAdd the tomatoes, bring to a simmer, then reduce the heat to low and cook for an hour.Cook the macaroni in boiling water till its half done. Drain it and add it to the tomatoes.Stir it into the sauce. Taste it. Add more salt and other seasonings as needed, and cover.When its cooled and the pasta has absorbed the tomato juices, transfer it to a 9x13 baking dish and cover it with foil.Bake in a 400 degree oven till its piping hot (about 45 minutes if its cold to room temperature). Just before youre ready to eat, remove the foil, cover macaroni with the cheese and broil till it looks beautiful.Meal Idea #2: Baked Cream Cheese SpaghettiSource: Plain ChickenIngredients: 12 oz spaghetti 1 (28 ounce) jars prepared spaghetti sauce 1 lb lean ground beef 1 tsp Italian seasoning 1 clove garlic, minced (or 1/2 tsp minced) 8 ounces cream cheese, softened 1/2 cup parmesan cheese, gratedDirections:Preheat oven to 350 F degrees.In a skillet, brown the ground beef until cooked through; drain fat and stir in spaghetti sauce. Set aside.Cook spaghetti according to directions on packet. Drain and place cooked spaghetti in bowl.Add cream cheese, Italian Seasoning and minced garlic to spaghetti. Stir until cream cheese is melted and the spaghetti is thoroughly coated.Lightly grease a 9x13 pan. Spread a small amount of meat sauce in the bottom of the dish.Put spaghetti on top of sauce and top with remaining meat sauce. Sprinkle parmesan cheese on top.  AdvertisementBake for 30 minutes, until bubbly.Meal Idea #3: French Bread PizzaSource: The Frugal GirlTip: This is a recipe that isn't really a recipe. It's just a way of thinking of making pizza a little outside of the box. Pizza doesn't have to be on pizza dough. You can make pizzas on top of other types of bread - including french bread, hamburger buns, hoagie buns or english muffins. In this way, it can be very easy to put different toppings on each person's pizza.Ingredients: French bread loaves Prepared tomato sauce Shredded mozzarella cheese Pizza toppings like ground hamburger, pepperoni, green peppers, onion, mushroomDirections:Cut the French bread loaves in half lengthwise. Place on cookie sheet. Sometimes to add more toppings, I remove some of the bread inside to hollow it out a little bit. Don't remove too much, otherwise it will get soggy.Spread them with pizza sauce.Sprinkle the pizzas with mozzarella cheese.And add whatever toppings you like.Bake in a preheated 400 degree oven for 10-15 minutes, or until the crust is crispy and the cheese is melted.Meal Idea #4: Oven Baked Meatball SubsSource: Home Cooking MemoriesTip: If you cooked the meatballs the night or weekend before, you could just microwave the meatballs and sauce the day you want to prepare the meal, saving time.Ingredients: Sandwich rolls (cut with one side intact) Cooked Meatballs (your favorite recipe or frozen, pre-made meatballs) Pasta Sauce (homemade or jarred) Shredded Mozzarella CheeseDirections:  AdvertisementSpray a baking sheet with cooking spray. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F.Place your frozen cooked meatballs or homemade cooked meatballs in a large pot.Cover with your pasta sauce. Gently fold the meatballs with the sauce.Heat the meatballs and sauce on low-medium, stirring occasionally, until the meatballs are heated thoroughly.Fill a roll with as many meatballs as you can fit (usually 4-5 meatballs, depends on size of meatballs and the size of the roll). Top with more pasta sauce from your pot.Place filled sandwich rolls closely on baking sheet. Top each sandwich with shredded mozzarella cheese. You can put into a 9x13 pan if you need a smaller pan.Bake until cheese is melted, hot, and bubbly.Meal Idea #5: Taco SoupTip: This one is great for the crockpot! But it doesn't take too long to heat up, so I tend to make it on the weekend, let it simmer for just a couple of hours in the crockpot, then reheat it on the week night that I want it.Ingredients: 1 lb ground beef 1 onion, chopped 1 pkg taco seasonings 1 pkg dry Ranch seasonings 2 large cans diced tomatoes, undrained 1 can Rotel tomatoes, undrained 1 can each: black beans, pinto beans, whole kernel corn. (optional) sour cream, Frito chips, cheese (I like Fritos!)Directions:Brown meat and onion. Drain. Add seasonings.Drain beans and corn. Add to meat along with tomatoes.Simmer until well blended and hot.Add a bit of cheddar cheese, sour cream or Fritos when serving.

8 Nutrition Tips For Plus-Size Pregnant Women Sunny Sea Gold ...,https://www.thebump.com/a/healthy-plus-size-pregnancy,"In general, overweight women should aim to gain between 15 and 25 pounds during pregnancy, while obese women should aim for 11 to 20. A plus-size pregnancy is a higher-risk pregnancy, so following weight-gain guidelines is that much more vital, says Margaret Wertheim, a registered dietitian nutritionist in Madison, Wisconsin. And keep in mind: Pregnancy isnt the time to start dieting. I definitely do not recommend pregnant women restrict themselves to the point of depriving their bodies or their babies of the calories they both need, Wertheim says. Instead, focus on eating nutrient-dense real foods emphasizing protein, healthy fats, vegetables, and fruit while limiting foods with added sugar. Read on for more tips on eating for two.Tip #1: Go lighter on the carbs.Overweight or obese women are more likely to have elevated blood sugar levels, which can lead to having a large baby, so Wertheim doesnt recommend consuming lots of carbs. Whats more, many carbohydrate-rich foods, like sweets, soft drinks, bread, pasta and chips, generally aren't super-rich in vitamins and minerals compared with beans, nuts, meats or veggies. But cutting them out altogether can lead to growth retardation, says Romy Block, MD, an endocrinologist who sees patients in a high-risk obstetrics clinic in Chicago. Stick to healthier sources of carbs, like fruit, dairy products and whole grains, which will give you and baby the nutrients you need.Tip #2: Slash your sugar intake.I always suggest that mommies-to-be reduce refined sugars and starches, says Julie Kabat Friedman, a health psychologist specializing in obesity and weight management and an assistant professor at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Were not saying you have to go cold turkeyyou can still have your treats. Just heed Friedmans advice to be mindful of portion size and make eating sweets a planned part of your day, instead of whenever you feel like it.  AdvertisementTip #3: Focus on lean protein.While youre cutting back on carbs and sugar, focus on filling your plate with more lean protein, like chicken breast, sirloin cuts of beef, beans, fish, tofu and low-fat dairy. Theres evidence that doing this helps prevent excessive pregnancy weight gain, decreases the risk of gestational diabetes and helps you feel more full, Friedman says.Tip #4: Try dividing your plate.Block suggests following this easy formula to get the right balance at every meal: Just divide your plate into quarters. Fill one quarter with lean protein, another with grains/complex carbs and fill the last two with veggies or a salad. Do this three times a day and youll have packed your day full of healthy nutrients, without overdoing it.Tip #5: Stick to a meal schedule.Stress eating can kick in for many pregnant women, especially in the third trimester when anxieties over big issues (delivery, child care, finances!) pop up. Friedman suggests creating a schedule that includes eating three meals and two snacks each day at a set time. Eating according to the clock helps prevent skipping a meal or overindulging, and it can help reduce emotional decision making about food. Need a few more ways to fight those stress-induced cravings? Try changing your environment (take a walk around the block or go run an errand) or distracting yourself with an enjoyable activity that doesnt involve food, like emailing a friend or browsing online for baby names.Tip #6: Check your prenatal vitamin for iodine.Getting enough folic acid and calcium during pregnancy is a no-brainer, but theres another necessary mineral you probably havent heard about. One especially important nutrient that has come to light recently is iodine, says Wertheim. Its essential for proper thyroid function and for baby's brain development, but about one-third of pregnant women in the United States are iodine-deficient. Check the label of your prenatal vitamin to see if it includes 150 microgams of iodine, and talk to your OB about the right dosage for your particular needs.  AdvertisementTip #7: Get those zzzs!Have you ever noticed its like a thousand percent harder to eat right when youre extra tired? Lack of sleep makes your body want to eat more, but then its too sleepy to burn off those extra calories, Friedman explains. Chances are heartburn, leg cramps or vivid dreams are going to disrupt your sleep at least some nights, but you can make sure you get the best rest possible by having a set wake and sleep time, and taking a hot shower before bed. Your body cools down after getting out of the hot shower, and that process has a relaxing, sleep-inducing effect, she says.Tip #8: Dont try too hard to be perfect.You and your body are going through a lot right now, and its important to be kind to yourself through this memorablebut stressfulexperience. Preventing excessive weight gain during pregnancy has health benefits for both mom and baby; but the same goes for stress, says Friedman. If eating perfectly while pregnant is stressing you out too much, take a step back and dont beat yourself up if you have to give into the cravings once in a while. No mother should feel overly pressured about weight during pregnancy, Friedman says.Plus More From The BumpNutrition During PregnancyWeight-Control Tips for Plus-Sized Pregnancy6 Tricky Things About Your Plus-Sized PregnancyRelated Video"
7 Quick and Easy Recipes for New Moms,https://www.thebump.com/a/easy-recipes-new-moms,
"Light ', <b>Meal</b>, u' Safe During Labor, Anesthesiologists Suggest",https://www.thebump.com/a/meals-safe-during-labor,"For most moms, labor is definitely a marathon, not a sprint. And after discovering the caloric demands of laboring women are literally comparable to those of marathon runners, researchers are suggesting that a light meal during labor would be beneficial.Sure, eating might not be top priority as you battle your way through contractions, but a lack of adequate nutrition comes with consequences. By not eating, women's bodies will begin to turn to fat as an energy source, upping the level of acidity in mom and baby's blood. This can potentially reduce contractions, resulting in longer labor and worse newborn health.Typically, women have been told to avoid eating or drinking during labor because of the aspiration risk inhaling liquid or food into their lungs, which is linked to pneumonia. But after reviewing hundreds of studies on the topic, researchers concluded this is not a concern for healthy women. Between 2005 and 2013, only one laboring mom was reported to have aspirated in the United States, and she experienced complications frompreeclampsia and obesity.Wondering why the recommendation to eat is just being made now? Thanks to improvements in anesthesia care (think epidurals and spinal blocks as opposed to masks and windpipe tubes), it's the first time health professionals feel comfortable allowing light eating to accompany pain management. The research was presented last month at theannual meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists.Our findings suggest a change in practice makes sense, says Christopher Harty, BN, co-author of the study. Physician anesthesiologists and obstetricians should work together to assess each patient individually. Those they determine are at low risk for aspiration can likely eat a light meal during labor. This gives expectant mothers more choices in their birthing experience and prevents them from being calorie deficient, helping to provide energy during labor.  AdvertisementSo what's it gonna be?

Feeding Gear That Will Change Your Life,https://www.thebump.com/a/must-have-feeding-gear,
Best Foods For Baby (and What To Avoid) Erika Rasmusson Janes,https://www.thebump.com/a/best-foods-for-baby,"When it comes to feeding baby, theres no ""Top 10"" list of super foods for moms to print out, stick on the fridge and stick to. (Sorry!) But experts agree that limiting your little one to a few best foods in her first year (or any year, for that matter) would actually do her a disservice. ""The first year of life is when the palate is trained,"" says Tina Ruggiero, MS, RD, LD, coauthor of The Best Homemade Baby Food on the Planet. ""The three rules I tell my clients to follow are: Go for color, think fresh and introduce new flavors and different textures at age-appropriate stages. Following these guidelines, parents will find more than 10 fruits, more than 10 vegetables and more than 10 proteins to try."" And while you'll also want to talk with baby's pediatrician for guidance, adding the following great options to babys dietand avoiding a few first-year no-no foodswill get him or her off to a healthy start.Breast MilkWeve all heard (and heard, and heard) that breast is best. But just because baby is ready to move beyond the boob doesnt mean you should stop nursing. After all, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about six months. But the organization also recommends that breastfeeding continue along with solid fooods until baby is 12 months oldor longer, if it works for both mom and baby. The very best food for the first year is breast milk, says Loraine Stern, MD, FAAP, coauthor of the book Nutrition: What Every Parent Needs to Know.Best Age for Breast Milk: Birth and older  AdvertisementIron-Fortified CerealBaby is born with a natural supply of iron, but itll be depleted by the time shes around 6 months old, Stern says, so introducing iron-rich foods is essential. One that fits the bill: iron-fortified cereal. It doesnt have to be the traditional first food of rice cerealoatmeal and barley are good options toojust make sure you start with a single-grain formula.Best Age for Iron-Fortified Cereal: Four to six monthsAvocadosAvocados are a great first fruit to offer baby, because theyre loaded with monounsaturated fats (thats the good kind!) and have a mild taste and smooth consistency. Theyre super-easy to prepare too: Simply mash a very ripe avocado with a little breast milk or formula until it reaches a pureed consistency.Best Age for Avocados: Six months and olderSweet PotatoesOkay, so theres no baby super foodbut sweet potatoes come pretty close. According to The Best Homemade Baby Food on the Planet, theyre one of the most nutritious foods for baby. Why? Theyre rich in beta-carotene, which the body converts to vitamin Aand thats important for good vision, healthy skin, normal growth and protection from infections. Plus, many babies like the soft, pudding-like texture of pureed sweet potatoes, says Susan Casey, RD, CD, pediatric clinical dietitian at Seattle Children's Hospital.Best Age for Sweet Potatoes: Six months and olderMeatMeatlike chicken, lamb or beefis an excellent source of protein, as well as iron, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6 and zinc. Just make sure its pureed to a smooth texture. (According to Nutrition, for infants, even finely chopped meat may be hard to handle and cause choking.) Try mixing the pureed meat with breast milk and a favorite veggie puree if youre preparing it yourself, or buy plain pureed jarred meats.Best Age for Meat: 7 to 10 months and older  AdvertisementBeetsBeets are an extraordinary nutrient source, says Ruggiero. Theyre a good source of folic acid, high in potassium and beta-carotene, and theyre a sweet veggiewhich babies take a liking to quickly. Roast or steam them until theyre super-soft; then mash them.Best Age for Beets: 11 months and olderYogurtPlain (not vanilla) whole-milk yogurt is another protein-rich option for babyplus, it contains calcium and beneficial live active cultures. (Confused as to why yogurt made with cows milk is okay for babies, but actual cows milk isnt? Very simply, lactose is already broken down with the culturing of the yogurt, and milk proteins are either removed or limited, so its easy for baby to digest, says Ruggiero.)Best Age for Yogurt: Nine months and olderCheeriosBelieve it or not, many experts love good old-fashioned Cheerios. The little Os in the yellow box are an excellent finger food and a good source of fiber. I dont think childhood would exist without Cheerios, says Stern.Best Age for Cheerios: Nine months and olderA FEW FIRST YEAR NO-NOSHoneyTempted to sweeten up babys bland pear sauce with a touch of honey? Dont. According to Nutrition, Honey is linked to infant botulism, an illness that can be fatal. The tummies of babies under age one simply cant deactivate the botulism spores that might be in honey, Stern says. So avoid this food until baby has passed his or her first birthday.Nuts and PeanutsYou can introduce small amounts of creamynot chunkypeanut butter when your child is one year old (try spreading a thin layer on a cracker), but avoid nuts in whole form until he or she is 4 years old to prevent choking.  AdvertisementCows MilkBabies just cant easily digest cows milk, which is one reason why experts recommend waiting until the one-year mark before offering it.Plus, more from The Bump:Baby Food Taste Test: What the Littlest Critics LikedBaby Food Recipes for Every StageWhen to Start Solid FoodsPHOTO:ShutterstockRelated Video"

How Often Should a Toddler Poop?,https://www.thebump.com/a/how-often-should-toddler-poop,"When it comes to toddler poop, consistency counts much more than frequency. Some toddlers poop once a day, and thats fine. Others poop every three days or so, while still others poop three or more times per day.Instead of focusing on the number, take a look at the consistency. You want to see a reasonable amount thats reasonably soft and does not cause bleeding, says Michael Lee, MD, a pediatrician at Childrens Medical Center in Dallas. You dont want to see very small, hard, ball-like stools that may or may not cause bleeding with defecation  those are signs of constipation. Very runny, frequent, watery poops are a sign of diarrhea.If you do notice signs of constipation, try cutting back on the milk. Milk (and other dairy products) are often the chief culprit in toddler constipation. Substitute water or juice for some milk, and your toddler may soon find relief. If not, talk to your doctor or pharmacist.If your child has diarrhea, he probably has a stomach virus. Offer fluids frequently to prevent dehydration. Avoid sugary juices or sodas, though, as the sugar in the drinks can actually increase the number of stools. Water and milk are fine. If your child is up to it, he can also have small amounts of soft, bland foods such as crackers, rice and yogurt.Plus, more from The Bump:Baby Symptoms and Conditions Guide Best Potty Training Books for Toddlers Healthy Meal Ideas for ToddlersRelated Video"
10 Pregnancy Foods To Eat For Baby Kristin Koch,https://www.thebump.com/a/10-pregnancy-foods-to-eat-for-baby,"EggsWhat it's got: Whether you like them fried, scrambled, hard-boiled or served as an omelet, eggs are the gold standard for prenatal protein. They also happen to be a great source of folate, iron and choline.Why it's good for both of you: Not only are eggs a relatively cheap, versatile and convenient source of protein, but they contain choline too. Never heard of that last one? Choline is critical to fetal brain development and reduces the risk of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida. But to reap the benefits, you'll have to eat the whole thing (so forget the egg-whites-only order); choline is contained in the yolk. If your cravings are more for a burger than eggs Benedict, youre in luck  there's also choline in beef. Bonus: Give baby a brain boost by buying eggs fortified with omega-3s.Sweet PotatoesWhat it's got: Don't just save these guys for Thanksgiving  sweet potatoes are full of nutritious fiber, vitamin B6, potassium (even more than bananas have!), vitamin C and iron, as well as copper and beta-carotene.Why it's good for both of you: Sure, other foods on our list offer many of the same nutrients, but we're singling out sweet potatoes for their beta-carotene  an antioxidant that your body converts to vitamin A. And as you may recall, vitamin A plays an important role in the development of baby's eyes, bones and skin. Sweet potatoes are also a great way to meet your iron quota. Not only do these orange spuds contain iron, but they also have copper  a mineral that helps your body absorb iron. So swap in sweet potatoes for your usual sides; they're great mashed, baked or French-fried (um, yum!)  AdvertisementNutsWhat they've got: This crunchy (and convenient) snack is full of healthy fats (including those brain-boosting omega-3s we mentioned earlier), protein, fiber and a variety of vitamins and minerals. Plus, noshing on nuts will help make a dent in the 800 milligrams of magnesium you're supposed to get now that you're preggers.Why they're good for both of you: Munching on magnesium-rich foods helps reduce the risk of premature labor and aids in the development of your baby's nervous system. A quarter cup of almonds contains 98 milligrams of magnesium, so keep a stash in your purse for a convenient prenatal power snack on the go. Cravings control: If you feel like a bottomless pit these days, try noshing on shelled pistachios. They take longer to eat, giving your body more time to register that it's full.Beans and LentilsWhat they've got: If you're not a big meat eater (or one at all), beans and lentils are great sources of protein and iron, as well as folate, fiber and calcium. And beans (especially baked ones) are also bursting with zinc.Why they're good for both of you: Beans boast a bunch of the baby- and mom-friendly minerals found in animal products, so they're a great option for vegetarian and vegan moms-to-be. Beans are also rich in zinc  an essential mineral that's linked to a lower risk for preterm delivery, low birth weight and prolonged labor. Beans bother your stomach? Other great sources of zinc include meat, chicken, milk, fortified cereals, cashews, peas, crab and oysters (just don't eat them raw!).  AdvertisementLean MeatWhat it's got: Sure, you know it's a great source of protein, but lean beef and pork are also packed with iron and B vitamins.Why it's good for both of you: Your body needs a lot more protein now (about 25 extra grams a day) to help the fetus grow and to ensure his or her muscles develop properly. Same goes for iron: Not getting enough of this mineral can impair baby's growth and increase the risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight. Iron is important for mom, too  it's necessary for red blood cell formation (to prevent anemia). During pregnancy, your blood volume increases, so you'll need to up your iron intake (to around 27 milligrams a day). Bonus: Meat supplies a hefty dose of vitamins B6 (helps baby's tissue and brain growth, while easing mom's morning sickness) and B12 (helps to maintain healthy nerves and red blood cells).Orange JuiceWhat it's got: Down a glass in the morning to fill up on folate, potassium and, of course, vitamin C.Why it's good for both of you: You've probably heard a lot of buzz about folate and folic acid (the synthetic form that you get in supplements and fortified foods), and with good reason: It's a necessary nutrient for preventing certain birth defects early on in pregnancy and for ensuring a healthy pregnancy after that, so try to get about 600 micrograms a day. The potassium in OJ is important for keeping your muscle function, metabolism and overall health in check. Like iron, pregnant women need to consume more potassium, because of their expanding blood volume. And as you already know, orange juice is an excellent source of vitamin C, which, in addition to fighting colds, helps your body better absorb iron and keeps both your and baby's teeth and bones healthy.  AdvertisementYou can also get your vitamin C from broccoli, tomatoes, strawberries, red peppers and a variety of citrus fruits, including another prenatal power food  mangoes, which are packed with more than 20 different vitamins and minerals. Bonus: Opt for OJ that's fortified with vitamin D, which increases blood circulation in the placenta and aids in calcium absorption so that your baby will have stronger bones.YogurtWhat it's got: Surprise! Plain yogurt actually contains even more calcium than milk. Plus, it's got essential bone-building nutrients, including protein, B vitamins and zinc.Why it's good for both of you: Calcium is essential for keeping your bones and teeth healthy and helping baby to develop his or hers, and skimping on this key nutrient could put you both at risk. Expectant moms should get at least three servings of calcium a day to reduce the risk of low birth weight and preterm delivery. If your calcium count comes up short, your body will take the calcium baby needs from your bones, putting you at greater risk for osteoporosis later on. Bonus: Snack on Greek yogurt topped with fruit for double the protein (and fiber) punch.OatmealWhat it's got: Those oats are filled with fiber, protein and vitamin B6.Why it's good for both of you: Start your morning off right with a nice big bowl of oatmeal. Whole grains are great for keeping your energy levels up, especially if morning sickness has you feeling a bit drained. Plus, all that fiber will help with another pregnancy pleasantry: constipation. But the benefits don't just stop with mom. This convenient breakfast dish (yep, the instant kind is great too!) also contains protein and vitamin B6, both of which are important for baby's development. Bonus: Look for a variety that's fortified with iron, B vitamins and folic acid.  AdvertisementLeafy GreensWhat it's got: You had to know these guys were gonna make the list. Chock-full of antioxidants and nutrients, dark-green veggies  including spinach, asparagus, broccoli and kale  should really be on everyone's plates.Why it's good for both of you: These super foods are especially important for moms-to-be and developing babies. That's because, in addition to all those antioxidants, leafy greens supply calcium, potassium, fiber and folate, plus another important nutrient we haven't told you about yet: vitamin A. Because of its role in helping baby's eyesight develop and aiding in bone and skin growth, it's important for moms to nosh on vitamin A-filled foods too. No midnight cravings for asparagus or spinach? Oranges are also a great source.SalmonWhat it's got: This oily fish is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids and protein.Why it's good for both of you: Forget about preordering Baby Einstein DVDs  just incorporate salmon into your diet over the next nine months. The omega-3 fatty acids (aka DHA and EPA) in fish help baby's brain to develop, and higher levels of DHA in newborns have even been associated with higher IQs, advanced motor skills and fewer neurological problems later on. Omega-3s are good for the development of baby's eyes, too, and salmon is also a great source of lean protein for moms-to-be. Worried about seafood? Salmon's low in mercury and considered safe for expectant moms, but limit your intake to two servings of six ounces or less each week to be safe. Just not feeling fish right now? Snack on walnuts and almonds.

Heartburn During Pregnancy Dara Pettinelli,https://www.thebump.com/a/heartburn-during-pregnancy,"What is heartburn during pregnancy?Its when acid bubbles up from your gut and irritates your esophageal lining, causing discomfort or pain.What are the signs of heartburn?Youll have a burning feeling in your chest, behind your breastbone. The sensation might start in your stomach and work its way up  it also might get worse when you lie down or bend over.Are there any tests for heartburn?Usually it will be diagnosed based on your symptoms. If its severe or chronic, your doc may want to see if you have GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease).How common is heartburn during pregnancy?Extremely! How did I get heartburn?Thoughmorning sickness seems to get all the hype, many women find heartburn just as unpleasant a pregnancy symptom. In early pregnancy, heartburn is caused by the hormone progesterone, which relaxes the uterine muscles to fit your growing baby  and also relaxes the valve between the esophagus and the stomach. In the final months of pregnancy, the baby squashes your digestive organs and causes heartburn.How will my heartburn affect my baby?It wont. Dont worry!Whats the best way to treat heartburn during pregnancy?Unfortunately, no matter what you do, youll probably still feel the burn sometimes. Talk to your OB about what meds you can safely take for relief (shell probably recommend an antacid like Tums, or even something stronger for especially severe pain).What can I do to prevent heartburn during pregnancy?Reduce the risk and severity of heartburn by avoiding triggers like chocolate, coffee, tea, citrus, tomato sauces, spicy stuff and fried foods. It also helps to sleep with your head slightly elevated and to consume minimal fluids with meals (just be sure to drink plenty of water an hour before and an hour after meals so you dont get dehydrated).  AdvertisementWhat do other pregnant moms do when they have heartburn? This will sound odd, but Ive found something that works: Put two teaspoons of apple cider vinegar (the raw, unfiltered kind like Bragg makes) into six ounces of water, and drink it. Its not so bad to drink, and it works! Something about the enzymes in the apple cider kills the acid and the burning. Ive drank it by itself when Ive been in the midst of a reflux episode and also drank it while eating a meal I thought might give me reflux.I take Zantac 150 twice a day. I did that for a few months, and when it got really bad, my OB gave me a prescription for Protonix.I took Tums for a while, but they stopped working. My doctor told me to get Prilosec...since I started taking that, I havent felt heartburn at all  its amazing!I avoid heavy, spicy, fatty foods and big meals. I dont eat too much at night either.Are there any other resources for heartburn during pregnancy?March of DimesInternational Foundation for Functional Gastrointestinal DisordersPlus, more from The Bump:How to get rid of bloating and indigestion?10 Foods Moms-to-Be Should Eat for BabyTop 10 Things They Really Should've Warned You About Before You Got PregnantRelated Video"

10 Pregnancy Myths Busted Alonna Friedman,https://www.thebump.com/a/pregnancy-myths-busted,"Do do this. Don't do that. With all the pregnancy ""advice"" out there, it's hard to know what to believe  or whom to believe. But remember, every pregnancy is different, so follow your doctor's orders above anything else.Myth 1: Eat three healthy meals a dayFalse! You should be eating six or seven small, healhty meals (every two to three hours). ""Eating frequently and from various food groups will keep your blood sugar in a constant range, which is healthy for you and your baby,"" says Stuart Fischbein, MD, coauthor of Fearless Pregnancy. Don't obsess about food and don't diet. What was good for you pre-pregnancy is good for you now.Daily nutrition checklistMyth 2: It's okay to have a drinkFalse! Choosing to have a few sips during a champagne toast or abstaining from alcohol completely is ultimately a personal decsion, but know that numerous studies have linked drinking during pregnancy with an increased risk of fetal alcohol spectrum disorders (FASDs). Both the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) say that pregnant woman should completely avoid alcohol during pregnancy. The birth defects associated with alcohol during pregnancy are completely preventable, says ACOG president Mark S. DeFrancesco. It is essential that all health care providers, especially ob-gyns, make clear to their patients that there is no amount of alcohol use that is safe during pregnancy.Alcohol in early pregnancyMyth 3: Decaf onlyFalse! One small cup of coffee a day is perfectly fine. While a recent study at McGill University in Montreal did find that the caffeine in two to three cups of coffee a day increases the risk of miscarriage, it did not consider how the coffee was brewed and the type of coffee used. Dr. Minkin points out that a French blend served black is much stronger than a weak cup of American coffee mixed with milk. It's another controversial subject for sure, but moderate caffeine intake (200 milligrams or less) isn't likely to harm you or your baby. The same goes for sodas with a caffeine jolt.Tips for decreasing intake  AdvertisementMyth 4: Cut out the cheeseFalse! Well, you don't have to cut all the cheeses. Some kinds, like cheddar and Swiss, are innocuous because they have been pasteurized. It's the soft, unpasteurized products like Brie, feta and goat cheese that might carry food-borne illnesses. If you're lucky, the market you frequent will carry pasteurized versionsjust start looking at labels more often. And then you can still enjoy your crackers with cheese.Why calcium's keyMyth 5: You're eating for twoFalse! Pregnancy is not a time to pig out. You certainly have a bit more leeway when it comes to a second helping of dinner, but on average women need only about 300 extra calories a day.Foods to eat for babyMyth 6: Say so long to seafoodFalse! Chances are that if the reputable (and tasty) sushi bar you love so much has not made you sick pre-pregnancy, you are not at risk when you are with-child. Yes, there is a greater risk of ingesting bad kinds of bacteria from raw foods (so you might feel more comfortable with a cooked-shrimp roll), but if you had spicy yellow fin before realizing you were pregnant, no harm done. The dangerous mercury levels, you ask? Again, it's all about moderation. Enjoy tuna on rye once a week, not daily. Not all fish are created equal. When perusing a menu, go with seafood with lower mercury levels, like salmon, shrimp, and tilapia. Unfortunately, swordfish and tilefish have the highest levels of mercury and should be skipped.The latest info on safe fish intakeMyth 7: You'll have to suffer through pain and sicknessFalse! Many OTC meds are safe during pregnancy, but somehow women believe they need to put up with migraines and be a slave to the runs. Not so. You should consult your ob-gyn before you take anything, but many experts give the following drugs the green light: Tylenol for headaches and fever; Tums or Mylanta for heartburn; Robitussin for colds; and Benadryl for allergies. Many prescription drugs are also okay to continue with during pregnancy, but again, follow your doctor's orders. Herbal supplements and teas are up in the airnot much research has been done on their effects on fetuses. The kinds you buy in the grocery store are probably safe, but check with your doctor first. If you need to soothe your nerves and want to take the natural route, meditate or eat a piece of chocolate. We prefer the latter.Complete guide to OTC meds that are safe during pregnancy  AdvertisementMyth 8: Skip the gymFalse! Actually, many experts say that in most cases, low-impact workouts can be a great way to control your weight and prep for baby. Just avoid contact sports or exercises that involve lying on your back (which reduces blood flow to you brain and uterus). Talk to your OB!Why working out during pregnancy is so good for you (and baby)Myth 9: They'll know you're not a natural blonde!False! Being pregnant does not have to compromise your appearance (at least not above the belly), but you do need to be smart. Fischbein says that while there is a theoretical risk associated with coloring your hair (chemicals being absorbed through the scalp), studies have not shown anything conclusive. He recommends avoiding dye for at least the first trimester, when the baby's organs are forming. Candice Wood, MD, an OBGYN at the Banner University Medical Center Phoenix, recommends relieving worries by opting for a natural vegetable dye over a permanent product (tomato juice, anyone?), or go for something semipermanent and don't leave it on longer than necessary while dyeing. Whether you're at a hair salon or at home, make sure the space is well ventilated.Also: Why you're now a frizzballMyth 10: Manicures are outFalse! You don't need to forgo weekly manis just because you want to be a mommy. ""You would need massive and long-term exposure to the products before there was a chance of problems,"" Fischbein says. Still freaked out about what's in the nail polish itself? Look for brands that are 3-free, meaning they dont contain dibutyl phthalate, toluene or formaldehyde, like Butter London, Scotch Naturals and Zoya. To avoid breathing in fumes, choose places that are well ventilated (you might even want to make your appointment for less crowded times of the day). Most importantly, make sure the salon sterilizes all their tools. ""If you were ever going to get an infection from a manicure, it would be when youre pregnant,"" Wood says.Plus: spa safetyRelated Video    All medical information reviewed by    Dr. Paula Prezioso    of Pediatric Associates in New York City."
And What to Avoid \u2014 at a Fast Food Chain When You're Pregnant,https://www.thebump.com/a/what-to-order-what-to-avoid-fast-food-pregnant,"WHAT TO SKIP: 4 menu items that arent as healthy as you thinkGrilled chicken: While chicken is a low-fat protein, some chicken sandwiches or salads can weigh in with more than 1,000 mg of sodium  almost half of the daily recommendation  and have more calories than a single hamburger patty, explains Jennifer McDaniels, MS, RDN, a spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics.Salads: Dont be deceived: that huge pile of salad greens can hold an even larger pile of toppings that add calories you dont want, mama. Large amounts of seemingly harmless (and even healthy) add-ons  like nuts and dried fruits, or even lean proteins like egg or chicken  can turn your 80-calorie salad into an 800-calorie entre. (Yikes.) But thats not all. That dressing you love can easily add another 200 calories to your light lunch. Stick with a low-fat, low-cal version  or better yet, get the dressing on the side.Smoothies: Smoothies may seem like a big win  after all, they help you meet your daily fruit and veggie requirements, right? But many smoothies are made with fruit juice and have a lot of added sugars, says McDaniels. Plus, when we _drink _500 calories we dont get as full as when we eat 500 calories.Soups: Healthy sounding soups, like black bean or minestrone, might be low in fat and high in fiber. But they could also have a ton of sodium. According to McDaniels, an average serving of black bean soup from a fast food chain contained 1,260 mg of sodium. Thats more than half the sodium recommendation for one day.  AdvertisementWHAT TO PICK: 4 menu items that arent as bad as you thinkHamburger: Surprise! That single-patty hamburger is one of the lighter sandwich options in fast-food land  as long as you go easy on the sauce. Skip the barbeque sauce or mayo and opt for ketchup or mustard instead. And pile on the veggies for added low-cal nutrition. But we dont mean French fries! If youre ordering a side, aim for fruit or veggies instead.Baked potato: White foods often get a bad rap, but the baked potato has blood-pressure-lowering potassium and is a rich source of vitamin C and fiber, says McDaniels, who recommends going easy on toppings like cheese and sour cream. Plus, baked potatoes are filling, leaving you more satisfied with your meal and less likely to indulge in other high-fat, high-calorie fast food choices. (Yup, like that Frosty. Sorry!)Beef tacos: Must-have Mexican? McDaniels says to skip the cheesy burritos and quesadillas, and order the beef tacos instead. One regular-sized beef taco clocks in at a reasonable 250 calories and is a good source of iron. But dont go overboard: stick to one or two tacos to keep your calorie-count in check.Regular-sized roast beef sandwich: It seems like the ultimate guilty pleasure, but if you aim for plain  meaning hold the cheese and the mayo  a hot, regular-sized roast beef sandwich will cost you less than 500 calories.6 ways to find healthy food at any fast food restaurant (yes, really)1. Theres an app for that. McDaniel loves Healthy Dining finder. Created by registered dietitians, it helps you quickly identify the healthiest menu options at nearby chain restaurants by city or zip code.  Advertisement2. Order off the kids menu. Heres a secret: The smaller sizes are often actually the perfect portion size for an adult. Plus, at some chains, you get fresh apple slices.3. Order an alternative side. Many fast food restaurants are offering a wider selection of healthy sides  think carrot sticks with dips, plain baked potatoes, those sliced apples, and fresh fruit cups. Skip the fries and balance out that burger with a fruit or vegetables.4. Aim for plain. Skip the sauce and save some calories. One tablespoon of mayo can have 100 calories, and some BBQ sauces and mustards (especially honey mustard) are loaded with sugar, says McDaniel. Aim for ketchup or plain mustard, but if youre totally craving the sauce, use a knife to scrape some of it off before you indulge.5. Dont be afraid to special order. For example, if the grilled chicken salad comes with a 300-calorie ranch dressing, ask if you can get the light balsamic instead. Use it sparingly  or dip your fork in it instead of pouring it all over, to get the flavor without overloading.6. Know your numbers. While some restaurants post calories and fat grams on their menus, most dont  yet. In the meantime, apps like CalorieKing provide the nutritional information for many fast food restaurants, making it easy to size up your options. You might find you can have that hamburger at a lower fat and calorie cost than that salad! Perfect if youre craving red meat.

What To Avoid During Pregnancy\u2014and How Not To Miss It Too ...,https://www.thebump.com/a/what-to-avoid-during-pregnancy-and-how-not-to-miss-it-too-much,"First off, dont dwell on the fact that you have to give stuff up. Instead of being negative, use this as an opportunity to do healthy things we all know we should be doing, says Laura Riley, MD, ob-gyn, director of labor and delivery at Massachusetts General Hospital and author of You & Your Baby: Pregnancy. Plus, when you step back and really think about it, its not really that much that you have to give up. Here are a few strategies to help you cope while you detox from your old routine.Get an energy boost without a bunch of caffeineTry: Six small meals a day. Some experts swear by the six-meal solution. The idea is that, instead of three big meals, you eat a bunch of little, healthy ones throughout the day to keep your blood sugar from spiking and dippingwhich could prevent your energy levels from plummeting. The bright side: Youre pregnantyoure supposed to be tired, says Riley. In other words, its also okay to give yourself permission to take a nap and to take things easier than you used to. Dont feel guilty about it, and make it a rule to always get a full nights sleep.Calm down without smokingTry: Yoga breathing. Smoking-cessation programs teach that deep breathing, stretching and relaxation techniques can help quitters cope with the urge to smoke. Yogas a great combination of all three. Its also a great way to deal with stress! Enroll in a prenatal yoga class to learn some moves. The bright side: If youve tried to quit smoking in the past with no luck, this time you have a better reason than ever to stopbabys health. Think about it this way: Once youve given it up for nine months, it will be so much easier to stay smoke-free. Forever.  AdvertisementGrab lunch without deli meatTry: Roasting your own turkey. Yeah, we know, its a big bummer that you cant eat a simple sandwich from your favorite deli, but listeria poisoningwhich is caused by bacteria that could potentially live on deli meatcould really harm your baby. In the worst cases, it could lead to miscarriage, premature delivery or stillbirth. Ive seen those cases of listeria and it is such a sad outcome, and people feel so incredibly guilty, says Riley. But making your own food and knowing that you cleaned it and the utensils properly will give you peace of mind that your food is a-okay to eat. Heating your meat to the point where it steams can kill the listeria bacteria too. The bright side: Youll save money by eating out less.Ease a headache without ibuprofenTry: Acetaminophen (aka Tylenol) is completely okay to take, as long as you follow the recommended dosage on the bottle, says Riley. The bright side: Its not like you cant take anything.Look hot without sky-high heelsTry: Wedges, kitten heels, lower heels (underthree inches) that are thick. Your center of gravity is off now that you're pregnant, and you just don't want to risk wobbles and falls. The bright side: These are all super-stylish options!Enjoy girls' night without a cocktailTry: A mocktail, of course! Here are a few favorite nonalcoholic drinks. Basically, anything sweet and bubbly (just add seltzer) with a lime perched on the end will still feel festive, despite the lack of booze.

"What Solids Should I Feed Baby, And When? Bonnie Vengrow ...",https://www.thebump.com/a/what-solids-to-feed-baby,"The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends starting solids around six months. Some babies go a little earlier or a little later  take your childs lead. Seriously, shell send the message loud and clear that shes ready. Signs of readiness can include opening her mouth for the spoon, sitting upright with support, mastering head and neck control, and taking interest in what youre eating.Step: 1: The introductionOnce baby gives you the green light, youll need to decide what to feed her first. Experts recommend introducing one new food at a time and avoiding honey and cows milk until baby turns one.Traditionally, pediatricians have recommended that infants at low risk of food allergies start with rice cereal, which mixes easily with breast milk or formula. Its easy to give in terms of taste, says Satya Narisety, MD, assistant professor of allergy and immunology in the Department of Pediatrics at Rutgers University. Its a change in texture but not taste, so its more likely to be tolerated.But plenty of parents skip the cereal and jump right to a pureed fruit or veggie, and thats perfectly fine too. There are no absolute rules on this, says Steven Abrams, MD, a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine. Parents should determine which tastes their babies like and follow their cues.Step 2: Moving onAfter the first feeding, Narisety recommends moving quickly to white fruits, like apple, pear and banana; yellow and orange vegetables, like sweet potato and squash; then on to green veggies, like peas, and ground meat, if youre not a vegetarian. Every three or four days, try a new food, she says. (Keep an eye out for any sort of rashes, swelling, crying, obvious discomfort, vomiting or diarrhea  these are signs baby may have an adverse reaction to a certain food.)  AdvertisementIn the beginning, offer baby two ounces of food per meal and slowly increase it to four if she has the appetite for it. During this time, you might notice a slight drop-off in the amount of breast milk or formula shes drinking. This is normal, Abrams says, and is something baby will self-guide.No one likes to waste food, but prepare yourself for the possibility that your child wont enjoy eating certain things  at least at first. If shes dead-set against mashed banana right now, for example, keep offering it to her over the course of several months. Oftentimes, babies need to be exposed to a particular food up to 10 to 15 times before they accept it.You may also have to get a little creative with how you prepare and present the food. Lets say baby wont go anywhere near chicken. Instead of serving up yet another chicken puree, try changing the texture so its a little chunkier (when shes developmentally ready, of course). Then, once shes okay with that  and again, developmentally ready  test out baked chicken or baked chicken nuggets. Its the same food, just in a different form.Step 3: Finger foods and snacksOnce baby can sit up completely independently, grab and release food, bring it to her mouth, chew food (yes, with her gums) and swallow, its time to introduce finger foods and snacks. (The AAP ballparks it around nine months.) Give baby two or three healthy snacks per day in addition to the pureed foods shes already eating.  AdvertisementYou may start with rice crackers or rice puffs, move on to soft fruit wedges and then Cheerios, noodles, beans, cooked vegetable pieces, and tender pieces of chicken and other meats.Aim for baby to eat a grain, a fruit and a veggie every day. And eat the healthy stuff yourself. Being a good example is very important, says Narisety. Kids see it much earlier than you think they do.Its also good for baby to get into a routine. Have set meal times, and have everyone eat together so kids understand sitting at a table, in a chair, with their parents, Narisety says.Plus, more from The Bump:Solid Food Starter GuideBest Foods for BabyBaby Food Recipes for Every StagePHOTO:Johner ImagesRelated Video"

"Easy (and Kid-Friendly!), Chicken Weeknight ', <b>Meals</b",https://www.thebump.com/a/easy-and-kid-friendly-chicken-weeknight-meals,"As the primary meal-maker in my family, I love meals that are easy to prepare. Meals that are time-consuming to prepare usually only get made on the weekends. Weeknights are for easy meals! Today, I'll share some of my go-to favorites. Maybe they'll suit your family aswell!The big thing that I like about many of these meals is that they have plenty of vegetables in them, so it cuts down on the number of side dishes I'll make!Meal Idea #1: Chicken Tacos (from Budget Savvy Diva)Serves: 4-6Tip: Since this recipe doesn't take all day to cook, it's a good one to make on a Sunday afternoon, pack away in the refrigerator and just reheat the meat for a quick weeknight meal.Ingredients: 1.5  2 pounds of skinless chicken breast  frozen or thawed 1 packet of taco seasoning (or you can make your own) 1 can (10) ounces of Rotel Taco stuff  tortillas, lettuce, cheese, sour cream, whatever your family likes.Directions:Set your crock pot to low and place taco seasoning, chicken and Rotel together. Mix.If chicken is frozen, it will take about six hours. If it was already thawed, it will be done in 3-4.Take two forks and pull apart the chicken and mix it into the awesome juices.If there's not enough liquid, add a little chicken stock.Serve on tortillas and add the toppings of your choice.Meal Idea #2: Chicken Alfredo BakeServes: 4Tip: The hardest part of this meal is the prep work  you have 3 pots going with pasta, veggies and chicken. If you had time the night before, you could steam the veggies, cook the chicken and boil the pasta and assemble it together. The day you want to serve it, just pop it in the oven when you come home from work. 30 minutes later, you'll have a great meal!Ingredients: 1/2 pound chicken, cooked, cut into bite-sized pieces 1 bag California mix frozen veggies (broccoli, cauliflower, carrots) 1 jar Alfredo sauce 8 ounces mozzerella cheese 8 ounces bow tie pasta Garlic powder  AdvertisementDirections:Boil pasta noodles until al dente. Steam veggies according to the package.Cut chicken into bite-size pieces and brown chicken with some garlic powder.Once pasta is done, drain.In an 8x8 or 9x9 inch dish, combine chicken, alfredo, veggies together.Top with mozzarella cheese.Bake at 350 until cheese is brown for about 30 minutes.Meal Idea #3: Jambalaya (from Pennies On A Platter)Serves: 4 (easily)Tip: To make this easier, when I'm preparing one of them, I really prepare two or three of them. While I have the rice and spices out, it's easy to measure them one or two more times and store them in a baggie until next time. Also, if you brown chicken for another recipe, just brown a little more and store in the frig until you're ready to make this. Brown once  make two meals!If you're making this for little ones and are afraid it will be too spicy, just omit the cayenne pepper  this dish can pack a punch!Ingredients: 1 cup long-grain white rice 3 Tablespoons dried minced onion 1 Tablespoon dried parsley flakes 1 Tablespoon beef bouillon granules 1/2 teaspoon each of dried thyme, garlic powder, black pepper 1/4 teaspoon each of cayenne pepper and salt 1 bay leaf 2 1/2 cups water 1 can (14.5 oz) diced tomatoes 1 can (8 oz) tomato sauce 1/2 pound fully cooked smoked sausage, such as andouille, cut into 1/4-inch slices 1/2 pound chickenDirections:In a medium bowl or canister, combine the rice, onion, parsley, bouillon, thyme, garlic powder, black pepper, cayenne pepper, salt and bay leaf. Stir to fully mix. (This mixture can be stored in an airtight container for up to 6 months.)In a Dutch oven or a large heavy-bottom saucepan, combine the rice mixture with the rest of the ingredients. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then reduce to a simmer. Cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is tender, about 20 to 25 minutes.  AdvertisementDiscard the bay leaf and serve while hot.Meal Idea #4: Saucy Chicken Broccoli Bake (from Tammy's Recipes)Serves: 8Tip: If you make any other dishes that use rice during the week, make twice the amount and just reheat the rice for this meal. This actually makes quite a bit, so I'll often half the recipe, but this also makes wonderful leftovers!Ingredients: 16 ounces frozen broccoli florets (or about 3 cups fresh broccoli florets) 3 cups cooked cubed chicken pepper 2 cans cream of chicken soup 1/2 cup mayonnaise 1 teaspoon curry powder 1/2 cup chicken broth paprika, optional 2 cups (8 ounces) shredded cheddar cheese 1 1/2 cups rice (uncooked measurement), cooked according to package instructions (should make 4 1/5 cups of cooked rice)Instructions:In covered saucepan, cook broccoli in water just until tender, about 5 minutes.In greased 9 x 13 baking dish, spread broccoli across bottom and sprinkle chicken evenly on top. Generously sprinkle black pepper over chicken.In mixing bowl, combine cream soups, mayonnaise, curry powder, and chicken broth, whisking until smooth. Pour over chicken. Sprinkle paprika on top if desired.Bake uncovered at 375 degrees for 20-30 minutes or until hot and bubbly. Spread cheese on top and bake 5-10 minutes longer, until melted and slightly browned.While casserole is baking, cook rice. Serve the chicken and broccoli mixture over hot rice.Meal Idea #5: Creamy Chicken Pockets (from Pennies on A Platter)Tip: This is another one that you can make most of it the night before. Just brown the chicken (or use some that you had leftover from some other meals!) and combine the ingredients to make the insides of the pockets. When you're ready to make the meal, spread out the crescent rolls, stuff them, and bake them! I leave the breadcrumbs off the top of them just to make it even easier.  AdvertisementIngredients:2 tbsp olive oil 2-3 small chicken breasts, diced 1/2 cup minced onion 2 cloves garlic, minced 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt 1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper 1 tablespoon butter, softened 3 ounces cream cheese, softened 1/4 teaspoon seasoned salt 2 tablespoons milk 1 (8 ounce) package refrigerated crescent rolls 1 tablespoon butter, melted 1/4 cup Italian seasoned bread crumbs, optionalDirections:Preheat oven to 375F.Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken with the onions and garlic.Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, beat the cream cheese and 1 tablespoon softened butter until smooth. Stir in the cooked chicken, onions and garlic. Add the salts, pepper and milk. Mix well.Separate the crescent roll dough into the eight triangles. Dollop a tablespoon of filling into the center of each triangle and fold the corners up to seal. Press and seal firmly. Place on ungreased baking sheet or stone and repeat with the remaining dough and filling.(optional) Brush the tops with the melted butter and sprinkle with the bread crumbs.Bake for 11  13 minutes, or until golden brown.To heat up leftovers, bake in a preheated 350F oven for 10 minutes.What are your favorite, easy weeknight meals?PHOTO:Thinkstock / The BumpRelated Video"

The Less-Mess Guide To Helping Baby Feed Himself Kristin Fuerst,https://www.thebump.com/a/the-less-mess-guide-to-helping-baby-feed-himself,"In a dream world...Get this kid some archery lessons, because hes a natural at hitting the bulls-eye. He raises his spoon up to his mouth and makes contact virtually every time, and he eats so neatly he barely needs a bib. What were you worried about? Clearly all those open the hangar, here comes the airplane lessons paid off. In reality...Theres baby food everywhere but in the baby. Your walls...and floor...and shirt look like Jackson Pollock paintings, and youre hoping his ultra-gentle bath soap suddenly turns tough when its tasked with removing those crusty dinner remnants from his skin. Youd help him out, but babys made it abundantly clear he doesnt want your assistance. (Thats what that fistful of applesauce to your face means, in case you were wondering.)Make this milestone easierAllow extra time for mealsTo encourage baby to master this new skill, give him the chance to feed himself on his own as much as you can. This may mean that lunch goes from a 20- to a 40-minute affair, but appreciate the extra innings for what they arepractice that will keep you from having to invest in a lifetime supply of pouches. Foods that allow the pincer grasp (grabbing between the forefinger and thumb) are easiest to hold and eat at this stage: Think pasta or small pieces of steamed veggies or baked chicken.Win some, lose someOf course you want baby to get the nutrition he needs. Around age one, however, kids tend to start eating less and becoming pickier. If one nights dinner is composed solely of yogurt, so be it. Offer options, but dont be surprised if most of them are ignored. You should also avoid enforcing the clean plate rule at this early stageit may turn this fun, new experience into a stressful one or create a habit of baby eating even when he feels full.

Sick of Being Sick,https://www.thebump.com/a/sick-of-being-sick-pregnancy-nausea,"If you're suffering from morning (and, maybe, noon and night) sickness, you may be wondering why it happens and whether it serves a purpose. ""Nausea and vomiting often are an indication that pregnancy hormones are elevated, which is a sign that the pregnancy is moving forward,"" says Laura Riley, MD, medical director of labor and delivery at Massachusetts General Hospital and author of You and Your Baby: Healthy Eating During Pregnancy. ""But that's not to say that women who don't get morning sickness are at risk for a miscarriage,"" Riley adds. About 25 percent of pregnant women who have healthy pregnancies never experience it, but for those who do, morning sickness usually lasts throughout the first trimester.Your odds of having morning sickness are greater if you experienced nausea as a side effect of birth control pills, suffer from motion sickness, have female relatives who endured morning sickness or are pregnant with twins or more. The good news is that a combination of lifestyle and dietary changes, as well as some alternative approaches, can provide relief in most cases.An ounce of preventionTo help avoid or at least minimize morning sickness, follow the ""slow, steady rule"" when eating. Instead of consuming three large meals a day, eat six small ones spread throughout the day, says Melinda Johnson, MS, RD, a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. And never let yourself get hungry; dips and spikes in blood sugar may add to queasiness. This is also why many women feel nauseated first thing in the morningthey haven't eaten anything since before they went to bed. To avoid having an empty stomach, nibble on bland foods such as saltine crackers and dry toast, and keep a box of crackers at your bedside to munch on before getting up in the morning.  AdvertisementSome experts recommend passing up foods that have strong odors, as well as greasy or spicy foods. However, simply listening to your body is the best advice. ""Eat what makes you feel better, or at least not worse,"" says Johnson. As long as you drink plenty of water and keep taking your prenatal vitamins, baby will be fine. Finding reliefIf nausea strikes despite your best efforts to avoid it, cold foods may be soothing, especially water-rich choices like melons, grapes, berries, fruit smoothies, cucumbers and oranges. In fact, for some women, eating any form of citrus helps alleviate nausea; even just sniffing a lemon can help. Others find relief by sipping vinegar mixed with warm water and honey (make sure it's pasteurized honey and not raw).Ginger is another antidote. A study published in the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology found that ginger was somewhat helpful in alleviating morning sicknessmore so when taken in capsules than in any other form. Fresh ginger, ginger powder (in tea) or dried ginger in tablet form is more potent than a less concentrated form of ginger, such as ginger ale, ginger snaps or prepared ginger tea.Acupuncture can be a safe, effective ""alternative"" remedy as well; most women need two or three treatments a week through the first trimester. Acupressure wristbands (such as ReliefBands), designed to stimulate the acupuncture points that alleviate nausea, are also available. But the bands won't do much for women whose acupuncture points aren't sensitive to surface stimulation.If you're vomiting, it's essential to stay hydrated in order to replenish lost electrolytesminerals such as sodium and potassium that regulate the fluid balance in your body. So load up on ice chips, citrus-flavored slush drinks, flat ginger ale (carbonation may make your nausea worse) and popsicles. Pace yourself with slow, steady sips. If you drink more than two ounces at a time, fluids tend to bypass the tissues and travel directly to the kidneys and bladder.   AdvertisementIf morning sickness persistsFor moderate cases, described as strong or persistent symptoms that interfere with a woman's quality of life or ability to take care of herself, doctors may recommend vitamin B6 supplements. Pregnancy depletes water-soluble vitamins such as B6 more quickly, so taking a supplement or loading up on food sources that contain B6, such as egg yolks, yogurt and whole grains, may help alleviate morning sickness. ""Work with your doctor to get the appropriate dose,"" says Johnson. The general recommendation if you're pregnant is 1.9 milligrams a day, while the therapeutic level can be up to 25 milligrams three times a day.According to Johnson, relieving morning sickness often requires trial and error. ""Pregnancies are as unique as babies, so keep trying different remedies,"" she says. PHOTO:iStockRelated Video"
How To Plan Baby's First-Birthday Party Sarah Yang,https://www.thebump.com/a/first-birthday,"When to throw it You want your friends and family to be able to attend the party, so if babys first birthday falls on a weekday, the weekend before or after is a good bet. Plan the party for after naptime, so he or shes well rested (and less likely to be in a bad mood). Limit the bash to a few hours rather than an all-day affairparties can be overwhelming for small children, especially if there are a lot of guests. And hold the party in a venue that has a private quiet space, so if baby needs a breather or gets fussy, you can take him or her there. How many to invite If its going to be intimate, the party might include grandparents, aunts and uncles, and a few baby friends from your play groups or classes. If you want to go all out and have a huge bash, invite extended family, friends, coworkers who have kids and so on. The size of your party ultimately depends on your own preferences, as well as your budgetobviously the more people you have, the more food, beverages and space youre going to need. Begin with your must-invite list: the people you wouldnt celebrate without. If you can add to your head count, keep going.Where to have it If you have a big enough home and want to save some cash, throwing the party at your house could be a good option. Hosting the event at home means guests can hang out longer and baby has a place to nap if he or she gets tired. Plus, baby might be more comfortable in familiar surroundings. Booking a restaurant or even a childrens play space could be costly, but the big advantage is that you wont get stuck with cleanup. Theres also no prep to deal with, and you wont have to entertain guests as much.   AdvertisementOtherwise, why not head to your favorite park? You can set up food and decorations at a picnic table (and some parks have barbecue grills). Plus, theres already a play structure there to occupy the kidsjust make sure that you have enough adults to keep an eye on them. Check with the local parks department to see if you need a permit or have to make a reservation for the space.How to choose a theme Does baby have a beloved elephant toy he or she sleeps with every night? Try zoo animals as a birthday theme. If your favorite part of the day is reading to baby at night, pepper the party with books. Or you can take inspiration from the season whether youre having an indoor or outdoor party. We've got more creative ideas for baby's first birthday theme here. How to budget and DIY If you dont want to spend a fortune on babys birthday party, DIY is your best bet. Bake your own cake, have the party at home and shop at closeout stores (they often have great toys and stuffed animals for low prices). If youre making your own cupcakes or treats, you can turn decorating them into an activity for guests. For invites, its fine to go paperless, which also includes RSVP tracking.What to serve When planning the menu, take into consideration whether the party is going to be mostly adults or if there are going to be kids of all ages coming too. Definitely have babys favorite food on hand. Foods and snacks that are healthy and can be eaten on the go are also good choices. For kid guests, serve things like mini grilled cheese sandwiches, chicken fingers or single-serve boxes of raisins. For adults, try sandwiches, wraps and veggies with dip. Be sure to note on the invitation whether youll be serving a full meal or just snacks and birthday cake, so guests know whether to eat before they get there. Double-check if anyone has eating restrictions or food allergies.  AdvertisementWhat to give as party favors At the end of the day, its customary to send kids home with favors. You can give away fancy swag bags or keep it small with little harmonicas or a bath toy. Or consider a favor that the whole family can take home, like a photo frame complete with a picture snapped and printed at the party. Want to set up your own photo booth? Try these easy DIY ideas. When its time to hand out the favors, give the goodies to parents first just in case they want to remove a few items or candies. PHOTO:Ashlee Culverhouse PhotographyRelated Video"

Get The Help You Want When Baby Comes Home Kelly Alfieri,https://www.thebump.com/a/get-help-you-want-when-baby-comes-home,"When I was pregnant with twins, my husband and I were trying to figure out what help wed need when our babies came home. Other moms insisted that we needed a baby nurse, who would take care of the twins in the nighttime. This person would teach me how to care for the babies and let me get more sleep at night since I could stay in bed and pump breast milk while she gave the children a bottle. I had a funny feeling about the idea, but I went with it and hired someone before the babies were even born.After delivery, I stayed in the hospital nearly a week and my newborns were in the NICU, so I wasnt able to spend much time with them. Finally, I was able to bring my daughter home, but my son had to stay in the hospital for a few more days. I was thrilled to come home and wanted to spend every second with my new baby and my husband.But it felt weird having a stranger with us in our home at every moment. I had little privacy, and this special time was spoiled. At one point, I let the baby nurse take my daughter into the nursery to rock her to sleep while I went to clean the kitchen. While loading the dishwasher, I burst into tears. Why was I cleaning the kitchen instead of being with my new baby? I realized Id much rather be with my daughter and have someone else tidy up. The next day, we gave the baby nurse a full weeks pay (a hefty sum!) and told her she didnt need to come back.  AdvertisementKnowing What Kind of Help You NeedWhat I learned is, before you bring baby home from the hospital, its tough to know how much and what kind of help youll need and want. Often, moms will overestimate or underestimate what theyll need and end up with too much, too little or the wrong kind of help (like I did). And when youre running on little sleep and recovering from childbirth, that can seem devastating.Finding the right support can be tricky, but remember that the help isnt just for you  its for you, your baby and your family. Not enough help can lead to stress and sleep deprivation, making breastfeeding difficult, and hurting your physical and mental well-being. A weak support system can lead to isolation and can contribute to postpartum stress.So how the heck do you figure it out? Take a few days with the baby and experience what its like, and then you can decide what help will really help you, says Lisa Spiegel, director of Soho Parenting, a support center for parents in New York City. That could mean resisting offers from family members or friends to come and help in those first days. Its important to do this, so you find a rhythm with your baby and so you have a true sense of what will lighten your load  whether its cleaning, cooking or help taking care of baby. People have so much advice about what women should do, but its so personal, says Spiegel, which is why she encourages couples to use their personal experience to figure out what will be most helpful to them.  AdvertisementGetting Help From Your PartnerMany new moms feel like they could use more help from their spouse but wrongly believe that their partner will simply know what needs to be done. We need to debunk the myth that this should happen seamlessly, says Spiegel. Adults need to say what they need. Partners would never run a business without meeting, but we think that our partners should just know whats needed. Its about meeting and talking and problem solving together. Spiegel recommends thatnew parents have a 15-minute meeting each day to check in, talk about whats going on and figure out what each can and should be doing.Getting Help From FamilySome new moms find themselves fighting off eager new grandparents who are launching a full-scale invasion of their home, while others wish they had more people available to help. If family members will be a primary source of support, youll need to manage their help and spread it out over time. Its a marathon, not a sprint, says Spiegel. If everyone is planning on coming right after baby is born, you could find yourself overwhelmed initially and without a soul in sight a few weeks later. Spiegel advises moms to be appreciative of the help offered but to let family members know its is needed in an ongoing way, so spreading it out would be most beneficial.Many moms could benefit from more support but feel shy about asking. If thats you, Spiegel says to remind yourself that asking for help isnt just good for you, its best for baby. Practice asking for help for the baby, says Spiegel. Yup, go ahead and ask them to help with the babys laundry or to pick up diapers for the baby, instead of asking them to do something for you, if that makes you feel more comfortable. If your instinct is to say no when someone offers help, make it a point to start saying yes. With a new baby, theres always a chore waiting to be done, whether its laundry to fold, something to be picked up at the grocery store or garbage to go out. If a friend comes by and offers help, give her a task. Youll be grateful to scratch something off your to-do list, and shell feel good about being able to help.  AdvertisementGetting Help From a Paid CaregiverIf you dont have family or friends who can help  or dont want to ask  and you can afford it, you may want to hire a doula or baby nurse to lend a hand. If you think you may want to hire one, you can interview candidates while youre still pregnant and narrow the field before baby is born. Or call someone after you settle in.Apostpartum doula helps support a new mom and family after baby arrives. To find a doula in your area, you can get recommendations from friends and family, or use the finder tool on the Doula Organization of North America website. And use our checklist for interviewing a doula for questions to ask.A baby nurse isnt actually a nurse  its more like a nanny who helps parents care for their newborn. Baby nurses usually stay in a familys home 24/7, and many new parents use them for a short period of time (two weeks, a month) so they can get some sleep at night.Plus, more from The Bump:How to Trust Baby's CaregiverSurvival Tips for Baby's First Weeks""Back Off Grandma!""Related Video"

Daphne Oz Dishes on Her Healthy Pregnancy (and Helping Other ...,http://www.thebump.com/a/daphne-oz-interview,"The Bump: Congratulations on your pregnancy! Can you tell us a little bit about White Ribbon Alliance and Star Showers, the causes youve partnered up with to help moms-to-be in need?Daphne Oz: Sure! White Ribbon Alliance's Star Showers works to bring everybody  from individual men and women, local organizations and also local and government authorities  together to create a really powerful voice that demands improvement to care before, during and after birth. Launched by a group of women-led organizations, White Ribbon Alliance, The MOMS, Kangu.org and Weinstein Carnegie Philanthropic Group, the goal here really is to make sure that every mother everywhere has an opportunity for a safe, healthy and happy birth. Here in America, its not even necessarily a given that you can have a healthy safe birth. I have been very fortunate to have great maternal care and I feel like so many people that I know have been able to experience the best of what maternal care can be and its our responsibility to be able to ensure that right for mothers across the world.TB: Wow, so amazing! Have any issues taken on a different meaning to you since you found out you were expecting?DO: Hugely so. I didnt realize how dangerous it was even in America to give birth. You watch the gift of life or whatever that movie is you see in sixth grade health class, so thats your exposure to what birthing is like. As an expectant mom, Ive made it my job to research every option out there for me, whether its birthing at home, water birthing, Hypnobirthing, birthing with midwife and birthing with anOB  and we are so fortunate to have access to that information to be able to choose what really makes sense for us and for our lifestyles.  AdvertisementBut certainly as a woman, Ive been aware of the problems that face women all over the world when it comes to giving birth and making sure that they are given sanitary and conscious conditions in which to do it. When youre on that journey yourself, you just become so much more in tune to how unifying this experience is. Its such a uniquely female and such a special time in a womans life if youre given the gift to be able to have a child and give birth. Its something thats so bonding in that way and as a mother, you cant help but want to know that all other mothers have the same, at the very least, healthy and safe experience you did.TB: Youre also a healthy living expert, so what are your top tips for other moms-to-be?DO: I am! And Im one of those nerds who just feels better if I read all the information; so when I first found out I was pregnant, I didnt plan to drink and I was planning to go off of caffeine and all that stuff, but then one of the first articles that I read was actually about caffeine, which was a much harder give up for me than my weekly glass of wine because we have to be at the studio at 6 AM! The article was written by a female economist who was also expecting (and an avid coffee drinker). She went through all the research that doctors were using to recommend that US women not drink a ton of caffeine while pregnant and she found that the data really showed that as long as youre drinking significantlyless than you were before yougot pregnant and as long as you don't have any increased risk of miscarriage or complications with your pregnancy,youre fine. It got me thinking: I cant imagine every French woman giving up her glass of red wine at dinner; every Japanese woman giving up her green tea.  AdvertisementAfter we told our parents that we were expecting, one of the first things my dad said to me was, You can read everything you want  but you definitely want to talk to your doctor. Listen to what your OB-GYN says. I took that advice to heart. Im very fortunate that I have a ton of doctors in my immediate family, as well as alternative medical practitioners and homeopathic experts. So I talked to all of them to see what made sense for me, which is advice Id recommend to every expectant woman. At the end of the day, the most dangerous thing for your baby is for you to be stressed out. So dont spend a lot of time or energy on stress, being anxious and worrying that youre not doing it right. In the end, there is no one right answer  your cravings are going to be different, your baby is going to be different, your body and your needs are going to be different. So, just really paying attention to what makes you feel good  thats the most important tip I could give.TB: Thats really wise advice! Have you made any changes to your routine?DO: Well, Ive always been pretty good about taking my vitamins and eating well, but I definitely got on the prenatal bandwagon right away. The most important addition to taking my prenatals was also taking a probiotic. You definitely want your gut in good health when youre pregnant because you absorb nutrition better when your gut is functioning properly and you have a good balance of bacteria. And so having a probiotic (in addition to extra dairy), gives you tons more calcium and vitamin D. I also started taking a DHA supplement. It helps keep baby brain at bay and makes sure that you and baby are getting enough DHA (since babies need it to develop their nervous system).  AdvertisementTB: Have you had any weird or embarrassing pregnancy moments so far? Especially because youre on TV for most of it?DO: Its a very interesting experience. I didnt really know what to expect and  I hope that Ive done somewhat of a good experience hiding it  but there have definitely been moments on TV where I feel like Ive just completely left my mind. Im talking to 3 million people and suddenly I just have to wing it! You know, you have this great idea cued up and it just evaporated! And this might be a little embarrassing, but everyone on the staff knows that if they cant find me its because Im peeing. Before I got pregnant, there were two things I prided myself on: The first was having an iron bladder, and the second was that I had the memory of an elephant. Now, both those things have just completely gone out the window!TB: Are you nervous about becoming a first-time mom?DO: Its the first grandchild for my parents and my husbands parents and its also the first great-grandchild on both sides of our families, so everyone is over the moon. This child is going to be so spoiled! Im also the first of my friends to have a baby, so I didnt really know much going into this about what to expect; you just know that youre having a baby so things are going to be really different. Im a little nervous because Im 27, so I still feel like Im in that post-college, not 100 percent adults stage; you know, not totally defined by Girls but in some ways, I still am. And Im so lucky to have a great group of girlfriends and we make it a priority to see each other and spend time together, but I know that once baby arrives, things are going to change dramatically. Its not so much that Im scared  just so interested to see how capable I am of balancing everything.  AdvertisementIts been so nice to go to prenatal classes and meet other moms-to-be in my area  theyre the best resources on the best parks to go to, where to buy baby supplies. Im sort of the guinea pig for all my friends!TB: Are you stressed about what your body after baby will look like?DO: I struggled with my weight a large majority of my youth. I even wrote a book about it. In college, I dropped the weight and adopted a healthier lifestyle. I refuse to go back to being totally neurotic about getting my body back or going on a diet or anything like that because I just remember how unpleasant it was and how it stole my love of food. I love to eat and thats how my family bonds. Thats not something Im willing to give up just to drop a size in my jeans. That said, my postbaby plan has been to try and stay as healthy as possible during my pregnancy. I think its better for baby to stay healthy and it also makes my life easier afterwards. Im looking forward to jumping back into real workouts because you do get a little nervous when youre pregnant thinking you could hurt the baby, so Im looking to get back to that without hurting anything (or anyone!). I try to follow an 80/20 rule: 80 percent healthy and 20 percent living for delicious food and great, worthwhile indulgences.TB: Thats a great rule to follow! One last question, do you have a favorite healthy, go-to snack?  AdvertisementDO: Yogurt is amazing and lately, Ive started carrying around baby carrots in addition to nuts. I also just discovered this Paleo granola. Its so delicious, all nuts and seeds, no grains, and it even has a little maple syrup to sweeten it  but not too much. When I went for my first sonogram, I was at the hospital and you know, you have to have a full bladder so they can look at the baby. I showed up in the waiting room with about 30 other pregnant women and all of us had to pee really badly! But I noticed that all the women had snacks  and I didnt! Ever since then, I always carry around snacks, something with a good amount of fat or protein so that I stay full. Sometimes I throw some cheese and honey in my bag with theapple to make it a little more decadent.Plus, more from The Bump:Nutrition You'll Need During PregnancyHealthy Pregnancy SnacksHow to Fit Prenatal Exercise Into Your Busy ScheduleRelated Video"

Eat More Fish During Pregnancy?,https://www.thebump.com/a/eat-more-fish-during-pregnancy,"For years, the FDA has warned that pregnant women should limit intake of fish to 12 ounces per week, in an attempt to limit exposure to mercury. But are these concerns unfounded (and maybe even unhealthy)?Alarge coalition of scientists, medical organizations, and doctors (including our own expert, Ashley Roman, MD) is now urging women to eat at least the FDA's recommended amount, if not more. They say that the Omega-3s in fish are especially important for the second-half of pregnancy, when baby's nervous system is developing, and that women should be urged to eat more fish.The FDA isn't currently prepared to revise its recommendation (but they do plan to study the new information).So what's a pregnant lady to do? Talk to your doctor, and check out the info we found below to help with your decision:According to our expert, Ashley Roman, MD:""To date, there is not a single case of fetal toxicity linked directly to fish intake..."" The FDA says:-""...high levels of mercury in the bloodstream of unborn babies and young children may harm the developing nervous system...""-""Do not eat Shark, Swordfish, King Mackerel, or Tilefish because they contain high levels of mercury.""-""Eat up to 12 ounces (two average meals) a week of a variety of fish and shellfish that are lower in mercury.""-""Fish and shellfish contain high-quality protein and other essential nutrients, are low in saturated fat, and contain omega-3 fatty acids. A well-balanced diet that includes a variety of fish and shellfish can contribute to heart health and children's proper growth and development.""  AdvertisementThe National Healthy Mothers, Healthy Babies Coalition says:-""Recent studies indicate that the nutritional benefits of fish consumption during pregnancy greatly outweigh potential risks from trace methyl mercury consumption."" -""Oily ocean fish are...an important source of the mineral selenium, which is essential for thyroid function and anti-oxidation. There is a growing body of evidence that selenium in ocean fish may also counteract potential negative influence of mercury exposure. While a nutritional deficiency from insufficient seafood consumption (long-chain omega-3 fatty acids) is quite common, the risk of mercury toxicity is exceedingly rare.""A study at the Medical University of South Carolina in 2007 found that:- The FDA warning has led 56% of pregnant women to cut too much fish from their diet. A British study published earlyin 2007in The Lancet indicates that:- Women who eat more fish while pregnant may bear children with higher IQs. **Also important to note: Different fish have different levels of mercury.

Date Night Ideas for New Parents,https://www.thebump.com/a/10-date-night-ideas-for-new-parents,"Indoor picnicOkay so maybe you cant get a sitter, but you can still make a meal feel special by rolling out a blanket on the living room floor after baby goes to bed and setting up a sexy picnic for two. Cook (or order) your favorite meal, turn on some mood music, light some candles and pour some wine. Even though youre hanging out at home instead of hitting the town, an indoor picnic can feel really special and intimate.StaycationWe know youre probably not ready to leave the state (or even your city) for a vacation without baby just yet. But a staycation is a great way to test the waters, so take Grandma and Grandpa up on their offer to babysit and head to a nearby hotel, B&B or even just Airbnb a local apartment for a night or two. Make dinner reservations, book a couples massage or just lounge in fluffy bathrobes and order room service. Oh and most important of all, sleep through the night uninterrupted! Fondue nightFlash back to the 70s and enjoy a little melted cheese (who doesnt love that?). Head to a fancy fondue restaurant to get your dip on or save money (and dont worry about getting a sitter) by making your own fondue, preparing some dippers (like crudites and crusty bread) and having a romantic night in while baby sleeps. Don't forget chocolate fondue for dessert!Ice skatingWhether you head indoors to a local ice center or, if the weather is right, to an outdoor rink what could be more romantic than holding hands as you skate around? This one might even take you back to dates in junior high and remind you of when you fell in love (even if it was probably long after junior high). When you need a break from the ice share a hot cocoa or pretzel at the concession stand and cuddle close to warm each other up.  AdvertisementGame nightIf youre a competitive couple, game night can be fun and, maybe even get a little intense. Order in some pizza and break out the board games. Will it be a Monopoly marathon? Or maybe a frisky game of Twister or dirty-word Scrabble? Best part? Theres no babysitter required for this one. HikingIf you're a more active couple, but you havent really been out much since baby was born, schedule a day hike. This is a fun daytime dateyou can leave baby with a sitter (or the in-laws) for a few hours and explore the great outdoors together. An added bonus: Youll get some exercise in and a few steps closer to waving that postbaby weight good-bye. Pack a healthy picnic to enjoy when you get to a nice spot with great views.Cooking classYou probably havent had time to make anything more elaborate than mac and cheese for dinner lately. But if you take a cooking class, youll have some baby-free time to learn some new ways to mix up your culinary repertoire. Look into whats offered near you and you may be able to find everything from sushi and Italian to French and Thai. Plus, you get to eat your efforts at the end of the sessionand sometimes, get extras to take home for later.Night at the museumIts time to get out and feel like a grown-up againand we dont mean barhopping. Check out your local museums and galleriessome have nights with extended hours, live performances or special exhibits. We know babys finger paintings are pretty awesome, but youll feel much chicer sipping a cocktail as you looking at some professional art for a change.

20 Ways to Eat Better,https://www.thebump.com/a/20-ways-to-eat-better,"1. Nix the processed foods. The combination of little sleep and caring for baby means you need high-energy foods, says Kimberly Altman, RD, of Pritikin Longevity Center + Spa in Miami. The foods that will energize you best are unprocessed, whole foods that are loaded with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Try choosing vegetables, fruits, whole grains, soy or low-fat dairy products, and healthy amounts of lean protein to fill you up. So grab your wok and saute up a quick veggie stir-fry, or put together a leafy green salad topped with tofu or grilled chicken. Low-fat plain yogurt topped with fiber-rich strawberries is also a healthy snack.2. Stay away from salt and sugar. While its tempting to grab a candy bar or cookie when youre starved, sugar will give you a short burst of energy that will leave you wanting to crash in your bed immediately after. And salt? Well it can increase your blood pressure and make you dehydrated.3. Aim for nine cups of water a day. Not sleeping enough can make you as dehydrated as not drinking enough fluids, says Lisa Suriano, a certified nutritionist and founder of national nutrition education program Veggiecation. If youre bored with just plain water, Suriano suggests snacking on precut watermelon and drinking coconut water (its a natural sports drink!)  both hydrate and replace electrolytes. Fruits and veggies with a high percentage of water can also give you the hydration you need: Try oranges, berries, cucumbers and celery.4. Dont be afraid of fats. Healthy fats, that is. If youre breastfeeding, its very important to incorporate healthy fats into your diet to keep your calorie intake up, says Suriano. Stock your fridge with foods like natural nut butters, avocados, coconut milk and chia seeds.  Advertisement5. Prep foods over the weekend. If you have a little extra time (or help!) on the weekend, thats the perfect time to cook a big batch of certain foods to then have on hand during the week. At the beginning of the week, cook a whole box of whole wheat pasta and keep it in a freezer bag in the refrigerator so its ready whenever youre hungry, says Altman. Just reheat with veggies and low-sodium tomato sauce and youve got an instant meal. You can do this with brown rice and baked sweet potatoes or regular potatoes, too.6. Eat every two to three hours. Dont forget to eat and drink throughout the day, says Altman. Its important not to go too long between meals and snacks in order to keep your energy levels up. Advice to eat more often? Were in!7. Get ready for snacking. Its pretty much a sure thing that youre going to get hungry during the day. Instead of reaching for the potato chips or cookies, prepare healthy munchies and store them for when youre ready for snacking. Keep a lot of fresh veggie sticks on hand and pair them with a protein-based dip, like hummus or tzatziki made with Greek yogurt, says Suriano. Pick up precut vegetables at the grocery store, or if you have visitors who are eager to help, put them to work cleaning and cutting them for you. You can also keep small bowls of almonds and dried fruit around your house (especially at your breastfeeding station) so when hunger strikes, a wholesome snack is nearby.  Advertisement8. Have plenty of warm foods. Might sound weird, but youll want to eat a lot more warm foods when youre recovering from childbirth. When your baby was growing inside of you, he was generating a lot of heat, says Suriano. Postdelivery, your body temperature normalizes. Choose soups, stews and pasta dishes to evoke the cozy feeling of being pregnant.9. Drink your nutrients. A smoothie is a perfect way to take in a lot of nutrients very quickly, says Suriano. Oats, greens and chia seeds can mix well together with fruit and yogurt in a delicious smoothie. Make a big batch of these and freeze for later.10. Make shortcuts. Sure, fresh, homemade foods are way better for you than take-out, but that doesnt mean you have to cook everything. Check out your local health-food/grocery stores premade section. It just may have some healthy salads and sandwiches ready for the taking.11. Stock the freezer. When you have a teeny bit of free time, prep some casseroles, stews or soups to freeze and cook later. Soups freeze well  a homemade bean, lentil or vegetable soup can stand alone as a meal or can be used as a topping over pasta, potatoes or brown rice, says Suriano. Invest in some steamer bags of veggies. Theyre easy to just pop in the microwave and heat (no pan necessary!).12. Double the recipe. Cooking something particularly delicious and healthy? Make double or triple the portion and freeze the extra to reheat later. On one of those nights when you didnt have time to shop or havent planned a meal, you wont have an excuse for ordering pizza.  Advertisement13. Keep taking your prenatal vitamins. Many vitamins are more easily absorbed if you get them from food rather than in pill form, so its important to eat a variety of nutritious stuff. But you might need to give your diet a boost by taking some supplements. So talk to your doctor about what is best for you. Suriano suggests continuing to take your prenatal vitamins, especially if youre breastfeeding. A fish oil, like a cod-liver supplement, will provide you with the vitamin D and omega-3s that every new mom needs.14. Consume breastfeeding-friendly foods. To give you and baby the fuel you need, eat foods high in protein and plenty of fruits, veggies and whole grains. Your breastfeeding diet should be similar to your pregnancy diet since youll need more calcium and iron than the average woman. But pay attention to how baby reacts when youve eaten certain foods like beans or cabbage  they might make her gassy or fussy.15. Seaweed and algae are your friends. Seaweed helps rebuild your bodys iron levels, says Suriano. Sushi is an easy way to incorporate seaweed into your diet, but try to stick to vegetable rolls, since mercury intake can be a concern for nursing moms. You can also try sea algae supplements, which you can get at health-food stores.16. Speed up childbirth recovery. Still feeling crappy after the birth? Foods high in potassium  like dried apricots, bananas, leafy greens, potatoes (with the skin!) and lima beans  help regulate water retention, so you can feel like yourself more quickly.  Advertisement17. Beware of certain herbs. Limit your intake of parsley and mint if youre breastfeeding, because theyre known to decrease milk production.18. Go high-fiber. Your digestive system is probably a little off right now. So be sure to load up on fiber  oat bran, figs, apples (with skin), pears, brown rice, black beans, turnip greens, broccoli  to get things, um, moving again. The bonus: Fiber may also help you shed some pregnancy pounds and help fill you up. Keep in mind that higher-fiber diets need more water for absorption  so keep chugging the water.19. Keep it simple. You dont have to cook an elaborate dish to stay healthy. Just put together some simple and nutritious meals, like brown rice and beans with salsa; baked sweet or white potatoes with cottage cheese, veggies or salsa; and oatmeal topped with frozen berries and bananas.20. Order wisely. When you finally make the trek out for a real meal at a restaurant, dont go overboard. Choose dishes that have grilled chicken or fish, whole wheat pastas or salads. If youre bringing baby along (brave mama!), Suriano suggests choosing foods that you can easily eat with one hand so you can take care of baby with the other  like a veggie or turkey burger. Just get the side salad instead of the fries.Plus, more from The Bump:New Mama BootcampHow to Love Your Postbaby BodyFun Ways to Lose the Baby WeightRelated Video"
How To Clean Baby's New Teeth,https://www.thebump.com/a/cleaning-babys-new-teeth,"You may be wondering why its important to clean babys teeth when he or she is just going to lose them in a few years anyway. Well, look at those baby teeth as benchwarmersthese first tiny teeth hold the place for babys adult teeth. If theyre unhealthy or deformed in infancy, chances are baby's adult teeth will have some trouble growing in properly. And in the US tooth decay is the most common chronic disease in children.So, now that you know why babys teeth must be cleaned, how do you go about cleaning only a tooth or two? Gentle is the key word in dental care as babys teeth are still soft and sensitive. You can put a damp, clean gauze pad on your finger and gently wipe babys teeth, or use a soft, clean washcloth. They even make disposable finger brushes specifically for babies (ask your pharmacist or dentist for recommendations). A baby brush with no more than three rows of soft bristles is also okay and should be available at major drugstores. If you do go this route, change the brush every two to four months because even though you cant see it, bacteria builds up on it. Babies also dont need as much toothpaste as you do. In fact, too much fluoride is toxic to their system. Remember, babies dont spit; they swallow, so fluoride in water combined with fluoride in toothpaste can be dangerous. The American Academy of Pediatrics recently backed earlier recommendations from the American Dental Association, deciding that cleaning baby's new teeth with a shmear of fluoride toothpaste (the size of a grain of rice) is safe. By age 3, you can upgrade to a pea-sized amount.  AdvertisementWhile brushing twice a day is sufficient, it doesnt hurt to wash babys teeth after meals and before bed. Make sure to also wipe the front of baby's tongue because its a haven for germs. Just dont go too far back or you can cause baby to gag.So when should baby go to the dentist? The American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommends that first visit by first birthday, but in the meantime, to help protect baby's pearly whites you should focus on a healthy diet. For example, watch baby's sugar intake (including natural and artificial) and make sure he or she gets calcium, phosphorous, fluoride (yes, small amounts are okay) and vitamin C (good for the gums). And never let baby sleep with a bottlethe sugars from breast milk and formula will rot those tiny teeth. If you must serve juice, water it down and serve it in a cup so it spends less time on his or her teeth. And, if baby is on solids, add some cheese at the end of a meal: It encourages saliva production, which can wash away cavity-causing acids and sugars from the mouth.Related Video"
High Cholesterol During Pregnancy \u2013 TheBump.com,https://www.thebump.com/a/high-cholesterol-during-pregnancy,"What is high cholesterol during pregnancy?Also known as hypercholesterolemia, high blood cholesterol means you have too much cholesterol (you guessed it) in your blood. Cholesterol is a type of fat that your body needs to function, but too much can clog your arteries and increase your risk of heart disease and stroke.What are the signs of high cholesterol during pregnancy?There arent really any outward signs that your cholesterol levels are higher than normal  youll pretty much feel the same as you would with normal levels. But if they stay high for a long time, the cholesterol can cause atherosclerosis (a buildup of cholesterol and fat) in your artery walls, which can lead to something more serious, like a heart attack or stroke.Are there any tests for high cholesterol?A simple blood test can determine your cholesterol levels.How common is high cholesterol during pregnancy?Its very common for your cholesterol levels to be high when youre expecting. Normal cholesterol levels are usually between 120 and 190 milligrams/deciliter, but in pregnancy they can be well over 200 milligrams/deciliter.How did I get high cholesterol?Your cholesterol levels naturally rise during pregnancy and while nursing, because your body is producing more cholesterol as part of its many hormonal changes.How will my high cholesterol affect my baby?It probably wont. However, if your total cholesterol levels go too high (over 240 milligrams/deciliter) your doctor may want to do additional tests or recheck your levels after your baby is born, to make sure youre not at risk for scary problems.   AdvertisementWhats the best way to treat high cholesterol during pregnancyDuring pregnancy your doctor probably wont prescribe medication to lower your cholesterol, but if your levels stay high postbaby, you may be given medication and be told to follow a heart-smart diet (low in saturated fat, high in fiber and including plenty of fruits and vegetables).What can I do to prevent high cholesterol?A healthy pregnancy will help keep your cholesterol levels in check: Eat balanced meals with plenty of fruits and veggies, avoid fried and high-fat foods, and exercise if your doctor gives you the okay.What do other pregnant moms do when they have high cholesterol?[During pregnancy] I stopped eating egg and cheese (almost completely). I started to eat oatmeal a few times a week and took fish oil. My cholesterol dropped to 200 without medications.Before getting pregnant, I took fish oil daily, which can help. Since my prenatals have DHA, I stopped taking fish oil, since they have similar ingredients. I think diets high in whole grains are good as well.I have high cholesterol. I was on Simvastatin, and my doctor told me that if I ever planned on becoming pregnant to quit taking it and then let them know. I actually quit taking it when we started TTC. The doctors office told me to just call them back after Im done breastfeeding to get a new prescription.Are there any other resources for high cholesterol?Centers for Disease Control and PreventionPlus, more from The Bump:  AdvertisementHealthy Foods for Busy Moms-to-BeWhat blood tests do I need during pregnancy?Checklist: Nutrition During PregnancyPHOTO:Elizabeth MessinaRelated Video"
Early Signs Of Pregnancy: Heightened Sense Of Smell Kelly Alfieri,https://www.thebump.com/a/sense-of-smell,"What causes a heightened sense of smell?Though there is no scientific research to back it up, many women report increased powers of smell when they become pregnant. From the faint aroma of a womans perfume in line at Starbucks to a whiff of a cubicle-mates lunch, seemingly innocuous odors can be over-powering to a soon-to-be-mom.The medical reason for this is unclear but the trigger to these symptoms is probably related to the hormonal changes associated with morning sickness. According to Yvonne Bohn, MD, co-author of The Mommy Docs Ultimate Guide to Pregnancy and Birth, Rising levels of estrogen and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the first trimester trigger nausea, vomiting, and morning sickness. If a woman is already slightly nauseous a strong odor may enhance these symptoms.What can you do about it?Is there anything an expecting mom can do to tame the effects of her new bloodhound-like schnozz? Bohn recommends avoiding strong smells and doing the things that minimize morning sickness. Eat frequent small meals, nibble on some crackers before getting out of bed, take vitamin B6 or B12, and take ginger tablets, tea or ginger ale.What else can you do? Try washing your clothes often (since odors cling to fibers), switch to unscented cleaners and toiletries, and surround yourself with the scents that you still like. Lighter scents like lemon and mint might help quell your nausea.Like many early pregnancy symptoms, a superhuman sense of smell usually recedes in the second trimester.More from The Bump:Most Common Pregnancy Symptoms  AdvertisementOther Early Sign of Pregnancy: Frequent UrinationOther Early Sign of Pregnancy: Sore BoobsRelated Video    All medical information reviewed by    Dr. Paula Prezioso    of Pediatric Associates in New York City."
"10 Ways To Make Solid Foods Safe For Baby Nicole Meadow, MPN ...",https://www.thebump.com/a/safe-solids-for-baby,"Kids under age five can choke on food and small objects. Believe it or not, a lot of the choking prevention advice for babies still holds for children up to 4 to 7 years old!Baby should sit up while eating, and be supervised at all times.Don't hurry your child when eatingallow plenty of time for meals.Only put a small amount of food on the tray at a time.Avoid peanut butterits a choking hazard.Avoid round, firm foods and chunks (hot dogs, nuts, meat/cheese chunks, whole grapes, hard or sticky candy, popcorn, raw carrots, other firm, raw fruit or vegetable chunks).Avoid foods that are sharp or angular (tortilla chips, potato chips, bagel chips).Avoid foods that are small enough to be accidentally inhaled instead of swallowed (seeds, shelled nuts, popcorn, raisins).Avoid stringy foods like string beans and celery.Do not offer baby honey before one year of age due to risk of botulism.The size of the pieces of food that you offer baby depends on his or her oral motor skills. Start small, and when you think he or she is ready to progress, make the pieces a little bit larger. If it appears that baby is not able to manage it in his or her mouth, go back to the smaller size, and try again with the larger size in a couple of weeks.Related Video"
8 Reasons Toddlers Freak Out (and How to Deal),https://www.thebump.com/a/reasons-toddlers-freak-out,"The braid in her hair comes unraveled and it sends her into a tailspin. He hears a loud noise and screams for an hour. Toddlers arent miniature grown-ups, says Heather Wittenberg, child psychologist and author of Lets Get This Potty Started! The Babyshrinks Guide to Potty Training Your Toddler. They really are a different breed. Theyre built to freak out. Plus, they change so rapidly, it can be hard for you to keep up. So while some flip-outs are par for the course, you might be able to head off some others if you understand the reasons behind them. They get famished  fast.Your body may be pretty predictable  three square meals and a snack or two and youre satisfied all day long, but toddlers can process food very unpredictably, depending on their activity levels and whether or not theyre going through a growth spurt, says Wittenberg. Plus, you cant just say, Oh, shell eat when shes hungry because toddlers usually arent into the idea of stopping play, putting down their toys and sitting still in a high chair. And what does hunger equal? Crankiness, of course. What to do: Provide snacks with staying power. Regular balanced snacks with protein can help prevent hunger-related meltdowns. I see too many parents falling into the trap of, Oh hell only eat raisin toast, Wittenberg says. Remember that youre the parent. Say You can have raisin toast as soon as you finish your tofu or eggs or broccoli. There may be a few days of struggle, but a balanced diet is important and you need to take back control if youve lost it.   AdvertisementThey need more sleep than you may realize.Between nighttime and naps, toddlers need between 12 and 14 hours of sleep a day, and most get far less than that. A toddlers sleep needs fluctuate with their development and activity level, and things also change when theyre giving up a nap, Wittenberg explains. If your child routinely falls asleep in the car, especially at non-nap times, its a sign hes not getting enough sleep. What to do: Stick to a regular nap schedule. Sure, its okay to interrupt the schedule when something important is happening, but toting a tired toddler on endless errands is a recipe for chaos. They've got super senses.Since a toddlers neurological system is still developing, they can be hypersensitive to touch and sound, says Wittenberg. Things that seem perfectly benign to us can feel excruciating to some children, she says.What to do: If you know your child is super sensitive, pay attention to the situations that cause a big reaction and try to avoid them as much as you can. The good news is that most (but not all) kids grow out of extreme sensitivities. They're immature.Your toddler hasnt fully developed the ability to reason. So explaining that shell get frostbite if she wears her mermaid costume in the snow might seem rational to you, but it wont even register on her radar.What to do: Pick your battles. If its not a health or safety risk, allowing your child the occasional irrational indulgence helps her feel like shes in control, Wittenberg says. On the other hand, if what she wants is absolutely out of the question, youve got to lay down the law. If you want to go outside, you have to put on your shoes and jacket, you might tell her. If you want to lie on the floor and freak out, thats okay, too, but Ill be in the other room. Eventually, shell learn that she really should listen to you to get what she wants.   AdvertisementThey depend on routine.Toddlers are very busy figuring out how the world works and trying to make sense of it all; its no wonder they thrive on order and routine. So if you always go for donuts after church but have to skip it one Sunday, be prepared for a hissy-fit. Behavior thats seen as a psychological disorder in adulthood is perfectly normal in toddlerhood, Wittenberg explains.What to do: Give your child as much advance warning of schedule disruptions as possible. And be prepared to repeat, Youre right. Usually we do it that way, but today were going to do it this way, at least two or three dozen times. They dont have the words to express themselves.Your toddler might have a lot of words in his vocabulary, but theyre still not enough to get his point across every time. And thats overwhelmingly frustrating  for both of you. What to do: If your kid cant find the words, Wittenberg suggests asking him if he can express himself in another way. Maybe theres something he can draw or somewhere he can take you to help get his message across. When everything else fails, tell your toddler hes going to have to put the idea away and go do something else, and that you both can try again later. They have no perspective.Sorry, mama. Your toddler may seem sweet, but the odds that shes got a full capacity for empathy are pretty low. This is a skill that builds throughout toddlerhood and beyond, so for now, its normal and natural for her to believe the world revolves around her. When you say its time to leave the park but she refuses, shes not being defiant  she just wants what she wants.  AdvertisementWhat to do: Sure, you can offer a reward (I have your favorite fruit snacks in my purse and we can share them when we get in the car), but avoid an outright bribe (Ill get you a milk shake at the drive-thru if you stop screaming), which will just make her want to act up again in the future.They need to have some control.Youre constantly telling your child where to go, what to do and when he needs to do it. So he may be desperate to have even an ounce of control over his own actions. (Can you really blame him?) For example, you tell him, I think you need to go to the potty, and hes bound to say, No, I dont and you cant make me! (either with his words or some pretty extreme actions).What to do: Remind, but in a way that says hes still the boss of him. Try, Ill bet youll feel much better when you decide to go to the potty, but its your body and youre in charge of it. This gives him the space to make the decision himself, which is probably all he really wants.Plus, more from The Bump:10 Annoying Toddler Habits (and How to Deal)Fun Ways to Encourage a Toddler's Speech Development10 Ways to Tame a Temper TantrumRelated Video"
What Should I Feed Baby For Breakfast? Bonnie Vengrow ...,https://www.thebump.com/a/baby-breakfast-ideas,"For an infant, breakfast isnt the most important meal of the day. Right now, baby is getting most of his nutrition from breast milk or formula, and eating food is more about trying a variety of foods than about finishing a bowl of rice cereal.Worry about quality, and let your baby worry about quantity, says Scott Cohen, MD, a pediatrician and author of_ Eat, Sleep, Poop: A Common Sense Guide to Your Babys First Year_.Start with fine purees for a brand-new eater, and graduate up to thicker purees, mashes and soft, small finger foods when hes developmentally ready. These are a few tried and true breakfast ideas from Amelia Winslow, nutritionist and founder of Eating Made Easy, and Bridget Swinney, president of the El Paso Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics and author of Eating Expectantly, Baby Bites and Healthy Food for Healthy Kids: Plain whole-milk yogurt mixed with oatmeal thats been ground up in the food processor before being cooked. Fresh peaches, pureed and mixed with quinoa baby cereal. Applesauce, preferably homemade, mixed with a small amount of ricotta cheese and cinnamon. If the applesauce is store-bought, the only ingredient should be apples, Winslow says. Baby oatmeal with pureed mango. Mixed-grain cereal with mashed banana. Small pieces of scrambled eggs with spinach, whole-wheat toast strips, and small or mashed pieces of very ripe melon (for older babies).Ideally, youre already eating a healthy breakfast, so rather than playing short-order cook, you can let baby sample whats on your plate. Around eight months or so, you can put small pieces of scrambled eggs on the tray and let baby play around with them, says Cohen. Give him little pieces of fruit, some cereal or oatmeal. Pancakes and waffles are okay too  just mush them up with your fingers so baby cant choke on them.

When Does Breast Milk Form?,https://www.thebump.com/a/when-does-breast-milk-form,"During the second trimester, increased levels of hormones will stimulate the production of milk in the mammary glands as well as the growth of milk ducts in your breasts. (Milk ducts are lobes in your mammary gland at the tip of the nipple.) But its not until after you deliver that youll begin full-scale milk production.Right after you give birth (but sometimes as early as the second trimester), your breasts produce something called colostrum, which looks like a thick, yellowish fluid. Its full of antibodies and will help strengthen babys immune system. Since baby only needs a small amount of nutrients in these first few days (because of their small tummy size), your body will naturally hold off on allowing actual breast milk to flow until after babys three or four days old. By this point, your body will produce milk in a supply-and-demand-like manner, making as much it needs to based on your breastfeeding patterns.Related Video"

These Fertility-Boosting Foods are In Season This Month,https://www.thebump.com/a/fertility-boosting-foods-perfect-for-may,"Getting your daily dose of vitamins and minerals is essential to any healthy diet  especially when youre trying to conceive. Youre probably already eating plenty of fruits, veggies, whole grains and lean proteins which are available throughout the year, but focusing your diet around seasonally-fresh ingredients has even better benefits. Not only is it good for the environment to buy locally (this generally means lower prices too), but when you buy in-season produce, it tastes fresher and is packed with more nutrients.You may think of summer as the ripe time for many fruits and vegetables, but according to James Parker, the associate coordinator for Whole Foods Markets global perishables buying office, thats not the case.In the produce business, we all kind of wish every month was like May. Its a time of intense change, and it marks the official start of the summer tree fruit season, Parker told Time. We also see a tremendous increase in local and regional production throughout the US. Because its domestic season, the product doesnt have to travel as far.May is generally the best time to add these fertility-boosting foods to your shopping cart:Avocados A great way to get your daily dose of folate is through avocados. Folate protects against birth defects in the brain and spine that can develop in the first few weeks of pregnancy. The green, skinned fruit contains vitamin K, which helps your body effectively absorb nutrients while maintaining hormonal balance. Its also high in potassium, a key to regulating blood pressure.  AdvertisementOkay, avocados arent exactly low-cal, but theyre mostly made up of monounsaturated fats (thats the good kind), so one a day is fine. Typically its best to buy organic fruits and vegetables, but you can save a few bucks here since the thick skin makes it hard for pesticides to seep in, says holistic fertility nutritionist Kim Ross.A great way to eat it: Spread one-third of an avocado on multigrain toast and drizzle with olive oil, another known fertility booster. It contains a high concentration of vitamin E, which is known to stabilize and protect cells from oxidative damage, a plus for women with PCOS or diabetes.Berries Blueberries and raspberries are loaded with natural antioxidants and anti-inflammatory phytonutrients, which help boost both female and male fertility. Like citrus, theyre high in folate and vitamin C, which can help with fetal development down the road. Berries are also a good source of fiber and can aid in weight loss (women at a healthier weight tend to have less trouble conceiving), so aim for at least one cup a day.Spinach Eating dark green veggies (like kale and Swiss chard too) is one of the best ways to take in essential prenatal nutrients like calcium, iron (especially important when youre menstruating) and folate, which also protects against birth defects in the brain and spine that can develop in the first few weeks of pregnancy. Since it can take a few weeks to even know youre pregnant, its important to load up on plenty of folate while youre TTC. Most women dont get enough from their diet though, so the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends taking a daily vitamin with folic acid (the synthetic version of folate) to reach the suggested 400 mcg dose.  AdvertisementCitrus Fruits Not only are oranges, grapefruits and other citrus fruits one of the best sources for vitamin C, theyre also packed with potassium, calcium and folate  a B vitamin that can help you get pregnant by regulating ovulation and creating a healthy environment for eggs. You should aim for at least one serving of citrus fruit each day (try a medium-size grapefruit, a large orange, three clementines or one kiwi) in addition to another serving of fruits.For more fertility-boosting foods, visit TheBump.com .PHOTO:ShutterstockRelated Video"

Is Peanut Butter Safe During Pregnancy? Jenna McCarthy,https://www.thebump.com/a/peanut-butter-pregnant,"Even the pros are iffy on this one. Thats because different studies have found different results: One study (published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology) of babies who had previously been diagnosed with egg or milk allergies found that those whose moms had eaten peanuts frequently during pregnancy (two or more times a week) were more likely to develop sensitivity to peanuts than babies of moms who avoided peanuts were. The more often the moms munched the legumes, the higher their babies chance of developing the sensitivity. But note that the babies in this study already had tested positive for other food allergies, so its not entirely clear whether moms cravings can be blamed. Another study published in _The New England Journal of Medicine _found no statistically significant relationship between moms pregnancy peanut consumption and allergies in her child.If youre not allergic to peanuts, yes, you can enjoy an occasional PB&J, says Hilda Hutcherson, MD, clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Columbia University Medical Center. But you may not want to overindulge  and its not because of potential allergies. Peanuts are a good source of protein, but they also have a lot of calories, Hutcherson adds. In other words, if you dont want to put on more pregnancy weight than recommended, you may not want to be putting away cans and cans of peanuts. But in moderation, good, natural peanut butter (look for the kind made of nothing but nuts and maybe a dash of salt  no sugar) can be a healthy part of your gestational diet.  AdvertisementIf you _are _allergic to peanuts or any other food, youre already avoiding it (or should be). Still, theres no sense freaking out about passing your allergy along. According to the Cleveland Clinic, babies inherit a tendency to be allergic; they dont necessarily inherit specific allergies. Talk to your doctor about how your specific food allergies could impact your pregnancy and whether or not you should be extra cautious about what youre eating.Plus, more from The Bump:Allergies During PregnancyFood Allergies in BabiesFoods to Avoid During PregnancyRelated Video"
7 Weeks Pregnant - Pregnancy Week-by-Week,https://www.thebump.com/pregnancy-week-by-week/7-weeks-pregnant,"7 Weeks PregnantYoure keeping the best kind of secret, arent you? Now that youre seven weeks pregnant, youre going about your day knowing youre expectingbut no one else can see it. That can give you a surreal feeling! And at week 7 of pregnancy, youre probably wondering what things will be like once its obvious to everyone that youve got a baby growing in there. For now, enjoy your little secret.How Big Is a Baby at 7 Weeks?At 7 weeks pregnant, baby is the size of a blueberry. Your embryo measures about .51 inches, having doubled in size since last week. He or she doesn't exactly tip the scales just yet, but is developing like crazy inside your 7-week pregnant belly.7 Weeks Pregnant Is How Many Months?Seven weeks pregnant means youre one month and about two weeks pregnant.7 Weeks Pregnant SymptomsBeing 7 weeks pregnant can cause a whole range of symptoms. Some are no biggie and some can make it difficult to get through your day. These are a few of the most widespread:Nausea. Morning sickness may be going strong at week 7 of pregnancy. Hang in there, and try to find ways to cope. Some moms-to-be have success with ginger, Vitamin B-6, and acupressure wristbands easing their tummy troubles. When your hormones become more normal in the second trimester, the nausea should decrease or even disappear. Moms-to-be who are 7 weeks pregnant with twins may be more likely to have nausea and vomiting, since they likely have heightened levels of the hormones that cause morning sickness.Food cravings and/or aversions. You may find yourself with the urge to eat specific or even weird foodsor not wanting to go anywhere near certain foods you used to think were fine (or even delicious!). Food aversions are natures way of keeping you away from potentially dangerous foods, and typically go hand-in-hand with morning sickness. It's okay to give in to your cravings and indulge here and there. But try not to go too crazy, and make healthy food choices when you can. *__ Frequent urination.__ If it seems like you have the urge to pee constantly, its not your imagination. Even though you probably dont look pregnant yet, your uterus has already doubled in size, and you also have increased blood flow to your pelvis.Acne. Breakouts are due to hormonal changes in your body. Before you use any acne fighting products, check with your doctor to make sure theyre safe during pregnancy.Extra saliva. Heres a symptom you never expected! The excess saliva is probably also hormonally triggered and could be related to nausea too.Mood swings. Not only are your hormones out of whack, but you're probably still getting used to the idea of being pregnant, and that can make you become extra emotional.Cramping and/or spotting. Cramping in early pregnancy is normal. After all, theres a lot happening inside your uterus, and even though it will be several weeks before you feel baby move, you can certainly feel plenty of cramping and pulling at this point in your pregnancy. Also, your cervix may be more sensitive now that youre pregnant, so spotting at 7 weeks could happen after sex. These two pregnancy symptoms can be alarming, but know that in most cases, theyre not a sign of ectopic pregnancy or other types of miscarriage. If you were to have abdominal pain worse than typical menstrual cramps or bleeding during pregnancy at 7 weeks thats heavier than a period, that would be a cause of worry, and you should call your doctor right away.That said, at 7 weeks pregnant, you may very well have no symptoms at all. If thats the case, consider yourself lucky! Some moms-to-be worry that having no symptoms at 7 weeks could be a sign of a problem, but its absolutely not. Well keep reminding you that every woman experiences pregnancy slightly differently. If you have any concerns, definitely bring them up to your OB, but unless your symptoms at 7 weeks pregnant are severe or painful, its all likely normal.7 Weeks Pregnant BellyCaught yourself staring at your 7 weeks pregnant belly in the mirrorand even pushing it out to fake a baby bump, just to get a preview? Yeah, we did that too during week 7. Every mom-to-be is different, but many report starting to show in the middle of the second trimester when the uterus outgrows the pelvis. Moms-to-be who are 7 weeks pregnant with twins should expect to show earlier than that, but at this point, its nothing but bloating for everyone.7 Weeks Pregnant UltrasoundHow amazing is this? Your 7-week embryo is generating about one hundred new brain cells each minute! And not only is baby's brain becoming more complex, but the heart is too. Also important: Baby's developing a permanent set of kidneys, and arm and leg joints are now forming as well.At seven weeks pregnant, youre gearing up for your first prenatal visit with your OB, and youre probably dying to know what to expect. Brace yourself to give a variety of samples (blood, urine, and cervical cells for a pap smear), get an ultrasound that will confirm babys doing okay in there, and get an estimated due date (yep, you might already have one, but the doc may adjust it a bit based on what she sees).A 7-week ultrasound isnt common, since many OBs dont see their low-risk pregnancy patients until sometime between weeks 8 and 10it depends on your health history and your doctors preference.With all the waiting, your mind may be full of curiositymaybe even wondering whether you could be expecting more than one baby. There are symptoms of twin pregnancy at 7 weeks besides seeing two gestational sacs on an ultrasound. For example, if you had a blood test to determine your pregnancy, your doctor would have found a higher level of the pregnancy hormone hCG in your blood. Some twin moms have earlier and/or more severe morning sickness (due to the hCG), and of course, moms of multiples may start to show earlier.Pregnancy Checklist at 7 Weeks PregnantReminders for the week:Read up on prenatal tests you can expectMake some pregnancy-safe beauty swapsCheck which OTC medicines are safe"

Going to the bathroom could be difficult or painful.Are there any tests for constipation?Nope. You know it when youve got it.How common is constipation during pregnancy?Its super-common! The American Pregnancy Association says approximately half of all pregnant women get constipated at some point during their pregnancy.How did I get constipated?During pregnancy, elevated progesterone levels cause smooth muscle to relax, which slows the passage of food through your intestines. This increases water absorption from the bowel and results in constipation. Your rapidly growing uterus, which compresses your intestines and pushes your stomach upward, also contributes to the problem. Stress, lack of exercise and a low-fiber diet can make you constipated too.How will constipation affect my baby?It wont be a problem for baby. For you, the constipation will probably just be a nuisance, but in some cases, it does lead to serious medical problems such as hemorrhoids, rectal bleeding and rectal fissures.Whats the best way to treat constipation during pregnancy?The first step in treating constipation is to make sure youre drinking lots of water (at least eight glasses a day), consuming enough fiber (as in fruits and vegetables) and getting ample activity (try walking 20 to 30 minutes daily). If the constipation persists, Metamucil or a mild stool softener such as Colace can help. If youre taking iron supplements, these may be contributing to your constipation  talk with your doctor about possible alternatives. In general, mineral oils, oral laxatives, enemas and rectal suppositories should be taken only after discussion with your physician, because they may stimulate labor.

I take Colace to keep things moving when I start to feel a little constipated, but Ive also been eating apples daily to try to keep things moving naturally (without medication)  it really does help!I had some severe constipation a couple weeks ago, and it is certainly not fun.

"Lump In A Baby's Abdomen Wendy Sue Swanson, MD Pediatrician",https://www.thebump.com/a/lump-baby-abdomen,"Whats a lump in a babys abdomen?Often newborns develop whats known as an umbilical hernia, a fairly common condition that occurs soon after birth or in the first couple of months. Youll see a noticeable bulge or soft swelling over the belly button (which is why its called umbilical), especially when your child sits up, cries or strains. In some cases, a lump in the abdomen for a baby or a toddler can indicate a more serious condition, like an underlying blood, kidney or liver problem.What could be causing a lump in my babys abdomen?If its an umbilical hernia, it was caused by a small opening in the abdominal muscle: When he was still in your belly, those blood vessels that passed nutrients from you to your child never fully closed. Swollen lymph nodes can also sometimes appear as small lumps (which increase in size when your child has a cold or virus). A more serious  but unlikely  cause of an abdominal lump may be a tumor.When should I take my baby to the doctor with a lump in his abdomen?Watch to see if there are changes. However, if the lump suddenly becomes larger, harder or darker and cant easily move (or be pushed back in), or if your child starts to experience severe pain or vomiting, call your doctor right away. He may have developed whats known as an incarcerated hernia, where a portion of the intestine becomes trapped (yup, incarcerated), and blood flow to the area is limited. Most often the lumps go away on their own, but if youre concerned, point them out to your doctor.  AdvertisementWhat should I do to treat my babys lump in the abdomen?It all depends on the docs diagnosis  chances are, you wont have to do anything. The vast majority of umbilical hernias go away on their own by the time the child reaches his second birthday.Related Video"
Q&A: Can I Be A Vegetarian While Pregnant? Sandra Le Plasse,https://www.thebump.com/a/can-i-be-a-vegetarian-while-pregnant,"No matter if you're a vegetarian, vegan, or macrobiotic, its important to be aware of your diet during pregnancy. If you believe you dont get enough protein (the building block for babys cells), be sure to talk to your doc. Otherwise, dont stress about it too much. As long as you maintain a balanced diet and keep track of what you eat, your baby should be just as healthy as one born from a mommy who ate meat during her pregnancy.Where to start? Many foods besides meat are rich in protein, including; eggs, soy burgers, tofu, legumes (beans, chickpeas, lentils, peas), whole grains (eat with legumes for a complete protein), nuts and seeds, milk, soy milk, cheese, fruits and vegetables, fermented soy foods, tofu, and peanut butter (try a spoonful straight from the jar).Now that weve got protein covered, its also important to eat certain foods or take prenatal vitamins to get other nutrients found in meats:[] Vitamin B12 is found in eggs, fortified yeast extract, and dairy products.[] Zinc is found in wheat, oats, rice, barley, and rye.[] Iron is found in whole grains, legumes, green veggies, and dried fruits.[] Omega-3 fatty acid is found in flax seed (yum) and walnuts.[] Vitamin D and calcium is found in green vegetables, almonds, milk, tofu, cheese, yogurt, whole-grain cereals, and legumes.Even if you cant stand the taste of soy milk or whole grains, keep in mind that eating healthy is essential for babys growth. You can always end your not-so-tasty balanced meal with a delicious desert because, well, you deserve it.Related Video"
What Is The Six-Meal Solution?,https://www.thebump.com/a/six-meal-solution,"Three square meals might have been the lesson of the day when you were in grade school, but now that youre all grown up  and eating for two  you may find that number just doesnt work. Some experts think eating smaller, more frequent meals (specifically, five or six mini meals instead of the old breakfast, lunch and dinner) can help alleviate some of the discomforts of pregnancy, including nausea, gas, bloating, constipation, headaches and fatigue. These mini meals can help keep your blood sugar levels stable, so youre not facing big peaks and valleys (of energy and mood!) that can come with bigger meals. And since youre already adding an extra 300 calories a day to help support your babys growth (about twice that if youre carrying twins), you can take advantage of these extra eating opportunities. Remember that your baby gets the nutrients he needs first, so make sure those mini meals are healthy ones, with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, low-fat dairy and lean protein to support his growth.Plus More From The Bump:Your Pregnancy DietGuidelines To Eating Right While PregnantIs Exercise Safe During Pregnancy?Related Video"
"Can Baby Be A Vegetarian? Jennifer Mellick, MD Pediatrician",https://www.thebump.com/a/baby-vegetarian,"There are three main types of vegetarians (and a few sub-types)  all of them eat no meat.Lacto-ovo vegetarians: They dont eat animal flesh but do eat eggs and dairy products.Lacto vegetarians: They eat dairy products but no other animal products.Vegans:They eat no animal products  including honey and gelatin. Find out if a vegan diet is safe for baby here All vegetarians should plan their diets carefully so that theyre not deficient in certain vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D and iron.Its relatively easy for baby to be vegetarian when he starts eating solid foods, usually between four and six months old. Some signs that can help you know that babys ready to eat solids are: shes sitting up, she opens her mouth for a spoon and closes her lips over a spoon, shes able to let you know if shes full or hungry, she keeps her tongue low and flat when you put the spoon in her mouth, and shes showing an interest in food while others around her are eating. All vegetables and fruits can be pureed and given to a vegetarian. A vegetarian baby can get protein-rich foods from pureed tofu, cottage cheese, cheese, yogurt and egg products, and strained legumes (like beans, peas, chickpeas and lentils). He should get a variety of fruits and veggies  and stay away from unhealthy foods that could be considered vegetarian, like potato chips that are fried in canola oil, or soda. Feed baby iron-fortified cereal to prevent iron-deficiency anemia.  AdvertisementThe bottom line  a baby on breast milk or formula can get a good balance of nutrients on a vegetarian diet. Ensure baby is growing at a healthy rate with regular checkups with her pediatrician. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening all babies for iron deficiency between 6 and 12 months  whether theyre vegetarian or not. It is also recommended that all breastfed babies and formula-fed babies who receive less than 32 ounces of formula daily, receive a vitamin D supplement.When baby grows to toddler age, its important to monitor her nutrient intake because toddlers tend to be picky eaters. Recently, the AAP began recommending a 30-month well-child visit to keep tabs on picky eaters health. Most toddlers, especially vegetarians and vegans should be on a multivitamin that contains iron.Plus, more from The Bump:Can baby be vegan?Safe solids for babyBest foods for baby?Related Video"
Q&A: What is hydramnios?,https://www.thebump.com/a/what-is-hydramnios,"There are two types of hydramnios: oligohydramnios, which means there's not enough amniotic fluid around baby, and polyhydramnios, which means there's too much.If there's not enough fluid, it could mean several things. It could mean your water has broken and some of the fluid has leaked out. Or it could be that baby's not peeing enough (yup, amniotic fluid is made of baby's pee), which could be a sign baby's not getting enough blood and nutrients from the placenta. The problem with not having enough fluid is that there may not be enough cushion for the umbilical cord, so it could compress, and baby might not get adequate blood flow from it. How oligohydramnios is treated will depend on what's causing it. If you're close to your due date and your doctor is concerned about baby's well-being, she may choose to deliver.In the case of too much fluid, there's no treatment necessary, but your doctor will watch you closely since the excess fluid could make your uterus contract and cause preterm labor.Related Video"
Eating Fish During Pregnancy Could Keep Moms-to-Be From ...,https://www.thebump.com/a/eating-fish-during-pregnancy-could-keep-moms-to-be-from-feeling-anxious,"Eating fish during pregnancy : is it a do or a major don't?According to the latest research, feasting on fish while you're expecting could lower a mom-to-be's risk of anxiety.The study, published in the journal PLOS ONE, involved more than 9,500 women that the researchers grouped based on their dietary patterns. One group of women was labeled as ""health-conscious"" and included women who ate mainly fruits, salads, fish and cereals. Another grouping, the ""traditional"" dietary eaters ate mostly vegetables, red meat and chicken. There was also a ""vegetarian"" grouping, a grouping of women who ate mostly processed food and a final grouping of women who ate a diet rich in sweets. The researchers followed women that rarely (or never) ate dark or oily fish (like tuna and salmon) and found that they were 53 percent more likely to have high levels of anxiety in their third trimester of pregnancy, when compared to women who ate fish at least once a week during their pregnancies. Also noted in the study is that vegetarian women that followed a strict vegetarian diet were also 25 percent more likely to have anxiety during their pregnancies when compared to women that followed a more flexible vegetarian diet that occasionally included fish and sometimes meat. Researcher attribute the link between higher fish consumption and a lower risk for anxiety to the omega-3 fatty acids found in fish.At 32 weeks, women involved in the study were asked to complete questionnaires. Those who scored in the top 15 percent were classified as having high levels of anixety.  AdvertisementStudy author Juliana Vaz, researcher at the Federal University of Pelotasin Brazil said that, ""In order to have a healthy pregnancy, women need to follow a healthy diet, and not something special for pregnancy."" Researchers defined a healthy diet as one that included whole grains, vegetables, poultry, meat and fish. At the conclusion of the study, researchers noted that, ""Because of the demands of a growing fetus, pregnant women need higher amounts of nutrients. The lack of fish and meat in a vegetarian diet may explain why vegetarian women in the study tended to experience more anxiety.""At the 32 weeks of pregnancy, the women completed questionnaires, and those who scored in the top 15 percent were classified as having high levels of anxiety.While researchers are still working out just how a low omega-3 diet may result in heightened anxiety, they think that it could be due to the fact that low omega-3s in the blood may disrupt communication between cells, which would affect how the body responds to psychological stress.But how do you know which fish are safe to eat during your pregnancy?Here's how to stay on the safe side:Fish and shellfish are good sources of high quality protein and other essential nutrients like omega-3 fatty acids. But, some types of fish do contain more mercury than others  eat these in limited amounts, or avoid them entirely. Keep in mind the following basic rules, and check out the FDA or EPA for more extensive info.Never eat shark, swordfish, king mackerel, or tilefish.Limit lower mercury fish such as canned light tuna, shrimp,salmon, catfish, and tilapia to 12 ounces (two average meals) a week.Albacore white tuna has more mercury than canned light tuna, so limit your intake to one serving (six ounces) per week.Fish sticks and fast-food sandwiches are usually made from low mercury fish. (And that's the only time we'll recommend the drive through!)  AdvertisementWhat about shrimp?Shrimp is safe to eat because it falls into the category of low-mercury seafood, which also includes salmon, pollack, sardines and catfish. But you should still limit your intake of these fish to no more than 12 ounces per week, says Laura Riley, MD, director of labor and delivery at Massachusetts General Hospital and author of You & Your Baby: Pregnancy.Did you eat fish when you were pregnant?

Weight-Control Tips for Plus-Sized Pregnancy?,https://www.thebump.com/a/plus-size-pregnancy-weight-gain,"Good job mama. Keeping an eye on your weight  while also getting enough nutrients for you and baby  is really important and boosts your odds of having a safe, healthy pregnancy, birth and baby.You may already know that women considered overweight should gain less weight than underweight and average weigh women should. Heres the breakdown of ideal weight gain total during pregnancy:Average BMI (18.5 to 24.9): 25 to 35 poundsHigh BMI (25 to 29.9): 15 to 25 poundsVery High BMI (30 or more): 11 to 20 poundsSo no, you shouldnt be trying to lose weight right now, but you should be aiming to gain it slowly and healthfully. Your doctor or midwife will weigh you at each prenatal visit and track the amount youre gaining at each visit.Of course, keeping your pregnancy weight gain within a specific range is easier said than done. The best thing you can do to keep your weight under control is to get moving. When women get pregnant, they tend to start eating more and exercising less. Its almost impossible not to gain too much weight if you do that,  says Debra Goldman, MD, ob/gyn at Women & Infants Hospital of Rhode Island.Create an exercise plan that include at least 30 minutes of exercise per day, five days per week  no matter what your fitness routine was before. If you werent doing anything before, start slow, says Golman. Just five minutes a day, starting off. Were not expecting somebody to go from zero to kickboxing or Pilates classes. Brisk walking, spinning or swimming are great workouts. Just be sure to incorporate some cardio to keep your metabolism working.  AdvertisementAlso, keep an eye on the calories. In the first trimester, youre not supposed to be eating any more calories than the usual 2,200 to 2,900 per day thats recommended for non-pregnant women. In the second trimester, youre supposed to add on only 340 calories per day, and in the third trimester, you should only add on 450 calories per day, which basically means one or two healthy snacks.Heres the deal on pregnancy weight gain  its not always neat and consistent. Some women lose weight during the first trimester because theyre so sick. Others gain a bunch in the beginning. And almost every woman has at least one month when she gains more than the recommended half-pound to pound per week. Your healthcare provider is more concerned with your overall health and weight gain than with what happens during any particular month.But if your weight changes drastically (either up or down) in a month, your healthcare provider might want to take a closer look at your eating and exercising habits, and make some adjustments that will benefit you and your baby. You may also be examined more closely to rule out any potential pregnancy complications.Learn how much weight is appropriate to gain for a healthy plus-size pregnancy.

3 Simple Homemade First Foods For Baby,https://www.thebump.com/a/danielle-walker-baby-food-recipes,"Danielle Walker is the author of New York Times best-selling cookbooks Against All Grain and Meals Made Simple.After being diagnosed with an autoimmune disease when she was 22 years old, Danielle realized that she needed to make dietary changes to end her suffering. She removed grains, lactose and legumes from her diet, and started her blog Against All Grain to help others suffering from similar ailments continue to enjoy food. I had so much fun introducing solids to my son. With my oldest, I relied on processed baby foods, but the second time around I really wanted to make my own food utilizing foods that we already had in the house and he would grow up eating. It may sound surprising, but his first food was egg yolks. While egg whites can be a high allergen food, egg yolks alone are rich in choline, cholesterol and other brain-benefitting nutrients. I started feeding egg yolks blended with breast milk to my little guy at 6 months. I also cooked a little chicken liver in bone broth for extra iron and blended it in from time to time for an added source of iron. Now that he is older, I soft boil or pan fry an egg yolk and break it up into small pieces for him to feed himself. After the yolks, we started introducing fruit and vegetable purees. Avocado, apple and carrot were his favorites off the bat. I prefer to steam the fruits and vegetables for purees to maintain as much of the nutrients as possible. Since babies' digestive systems are not fully developed until about 1 year, I add a little healthy fat such as ghee or coconut oil to my veggie purees to aid in digestion. Plus, he loves the taste!   AdvertisementApple PureeYou'll need:2 apples, peeled, cored, and cubed Place the prepared apples in a steamer basket in a pot filled with 2 inches of water making sure the water is not touching the basket. Cover, place pot over medium-low heat, and steam until tender approximately 12-15 minutes. Place the apples in a blender and puree until smooth. Carrot PureeYou'll need:3 medium carrots, peeled and cubed2 tablespoons water2 teaspoons ghee, melted Place the prepared carrots in a steamer basket in a pot filled with 2 inches of water making sure the water is not touching the basket. Cover, place pot over medium-low heat, and steam until tender approximately 12-15 minutes. Place the carrots, water, and ghee in a blender and puree until smooth. Add more water if necessary until you have reached your desired consistency. Egg Yolk PureeYou'll need:4 eggs, at room temperature1 to 1 1/2 ounces milk of choice (thinned to desired consistency) Place 6 cups of water in a pot over high heat. Once the water is boiling, gently place the eggs in the pot. Reduce the temperature to medium heat so the water is at a gentle boil. Cook the eggs for 8 minutes to achieve a soft-boiled egg. Remove the eggs and place them in a bowl filled with cold water for 5 minutes. Peel the shell off and discard the whites or save them for another use.

20 Ways to Eat Better,https://www.thebump.com/a/20-ways-to-eat-better,"1. Nix the processed foods. The combination of little sleep and caring for baby means you need high-energy foods, says Kimberly Altman, RD, of Pritikin Longevity Center + Spa in Miami. The foods that will energize you best are unprocessed, whole foods that are loaded with vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Try choosing vegetables, fruits, whole grains, soy or low-fat dairy products, and healthy amounts of lean protein to fill you up. So grab your wok and saute up a quick veggie stir-fry, or put together a leafy green salad topped with tofu or grilled chicken. Low-fat plain yogurt topped with fiber-rich strawberries is also a healthy snack.2. Stay away from salt and sugar. While its tempting to grab a candy bar or cookie when youre starved, sugar will give you a short burst of energy that will leave you wanting to crash in your bed immediately after. And salt? Well it can increase your blood pressure and make you dehydrated.3. Aim for nine cups of water a day. Not sleeping enough can make you as dehydrated as not drinking enough fluids, says Lisa Suriano, a certified nutritionist and founder of national nutrition education program Veggiecation. If youre bored with just plain water, Suriano suggests snacking on precut watermelon and drinking coconut water (its a natural sports drink!)  both hydrate and replace electrolytes. Fruits and veggies with a high percentage of water can also give you the hydration you need: Try oranges, berries, cucumbers and celery.4. Dont be afraid of fats. Healthy fats, that is. If youre breastfeeding, its very important to incorporate healthy fats into your diet to keep your calorie intake up, says Suriano. Stock your fridge with foods like natural nut butters, avocados, coconut milk and chia seeds.  Advertisement5. Prep foods over the weekend. If you have a little extra time (or help!) on the weekend, thats the perfect time to cook a big batch of certain foods to then have on hand during the week. At the beginning of the week, cook a whole box of whole wheat pasta and keep it in a freezer bag in the refrigerator so its ready whenever youre hungry, says Altman. Just reheat with veggies and low-sodium tomato sauce and youve got an instant meal. You can do this with brown rice and baked sweet potatoes or regular potatoes, too.6. Eat every two to three hours. Dont forget to eat and drink throughout the day, says Altman. Its important not to go too long between meals and snacks in order to keep your energy levels up. Advice to eat more often? Were in!7. Get ready for snacking. Its pretty much a sure thing that youre going to get hungry during the day. Instead of reaching for the potato chips or cookies, prepare healthy munchies and store them for when youre ready for snacking. Keep a lot of fresh veggie sticks on hand and pair them with a protein-based dip, like hummus or tzatziki made with Greek yogurt, says Suriano. Pick up precut vegetables at the grocery store, or if you have visitors who are eager to help, put them to work cleaning and cutting them for you. You can also keep small bowls of almonds and dried fruit around your house (especially at your breastfeeding station) so when hunger strikes, a wholesome snack is nearby.  Advertisement8. Have plenty of warm foods. Might sound weird, but youll want to eat a lot more warm foods when youre recovering from childbirth. When your baby was growing inside of you, he was generating a lot of heat, says Suriano. Postdelivery, your body temperature normalizes. Choose soups, stews and pasta dishes to evoke the cozy feeling of being pregnant.9. Drink your nutrients. A smoothie is a perfect way to take in a lot of nutrients very quickly, says Suriano. Oats, greens and chia seeds can mix well together with fruit and yogurt in a delicious smoothie. Make a big batch of these and freeze for later.10. Make shortcuts. Sure, fresh, homemade foods are way better for you than take-out, but that doesnt mean you have to cook everything. Check out your local health-food/grocery stores premade section. It just may have some healthy salads and sandwiches ready for the taking.11. Stock the freezer. When you have a teeny bit of free time, prep some casseroles, stews or soups to freeze and cook later. Soups freeze well  a homemade bean, lentil or vegetable soup can stand alone as a meal or can be used as a topping over pasta, potatoes or brown rice, says Suriano. Invest in some steamer bags of veggies. Theyre easy to just pop in the microwave and heat (no pan necessary!).12. Double the recipe. Cooking something particularly delicious and healthy? Make double or triple the portion and freeze the extra to reheat later. On one of those nights when you didnt have time to shop or havent planned a meal, you wont have an excuse for ordering pizza.  Advertisement13. Keep taking your prenatal vitamins. Many vitamins are more easily absorbed if you get them from food rather than in pill form, so its important to eat a variety of nutritious stuff. But you might need to give your diet a boost by taking some supplements. So talk to your doctor about what is best for you. Suriano suggests continuing to take your prenatal vitamins, especially if youre breastfeeding. A fish oil, like a cod-liver supplement, will provide you with the vitamin D and omega-3s that every new mom needs.14. Consume breastfeeding-friendly foods. To give you and baby the fuel you need, eat foods high in protein and plenty of fruits, veggies and whole grains. Your breastfeeding diet should be similar to your pregnancy diet since youll need more calcium and iron than the average woman. But pay attention to how baby reacts when youve eaten certain foods like beans or cabbage  they might make her gassy or fussy.15. Seaweed and algae are your friends. Seaweed helps rebuild your bodys iron levels, says Suriano. Sushi is an easy way to incorporate seaweed into your diet, but try to stick to vegetable rolls, since mercury intake can be a concern for nursing moms. You can also try sea algae supplements, which you can get at health-food stores.16. Speed up childbirth recovery. Still feeling crappy after the birth? Foods high in potassium  like dried apricots, bananas, leafy greens, potatoes (with the skin!) and lima beans  help regulate water retention, so you can feel like yourself more quickly.  Advertisement17. Beware of certain herbs. Limit your intake of parsley and mint if youre breastfeeding, because theyre known to decrease milk production.18. Go high-fiber. Your digestive system is probably a little off right now. So be sure to load up on fiber  oat bran, figs, apples (with skin), pears, brown rice, black beans, turnip greens, broccoli  to get things, um, moving again. The bonus: Fiber may also help you shed some pregnancy pounds and help fill you up. Keep in mind that higher-fiber diets need more water for absorption  so keep chugging the water.19. Keep it simple. You dont have to cook an elaborate dish to stay healthy. Just put together some simple and nutritious meals, like brown rice and beans with salsa; baked sweet or white potatoes with cottage cheese, veggies or salsa; and oatmeal topped with frozen berries and bananas.20. Order wisely. When you finally make the trek out for a real meal at a restaurant, dont go overboard. Choose dishes that have grilled chicken or fish, whole wheat pastas or salads. If youre bringing baby along (brave mama!), Suriano suggests choosing foods that you can easily eat with one hand so you can take care of baby with the other  like a veggie or turkey burger. Just get the side salad instead of the fries.Plus, more from The Bump:New Mama BootcampHow to Love Your Postbaby BodyFun Ways to Lose the Baby WeightRelated Video"
"Sinusitis During Pregnancy Laura Riley, MD OB-GYN",https://www.thebump.com/a/sinusitis-during-pregnancy,"What is sinusitis during pregnancy?Sinusitis is just a fancy name for a sinus infection. It happens when your sinuses become inflamed and swollen, and mucus cant drain properly. Its bad enough when youre not pregnant, but its even worse when you are pregnant because its hard to tell whether the symptoms are caused by an actual infection or just your hormones.What are the signs of sinusitis?You may see some yellow or greenish discharge (yuck!) from your nose. You also might have trouble breathing through your nose, feel pain and pressure around your face and have a bad cough, and your senses of smell and taste might not seem to be working so well  sounds like fun, huh? Other symptoms include earaches, headaches, sore throat and fatigue.Are there any tests for sinusitis?Your doctor may give you a nasal endoscopy to see whats going on inside your nose. If she suspects that allergies are the culprit, you may be tested for them.How common is sinusitis during pregnancy?It can be more common during pregnancy. The tricky thing about dealing with sinus issues is figuring out whether they're pregnancy-related. That's because pregnancy can cause the blood vessels and membranes in your nose to swell (yep, its not just your ankles), making it tough to breathe through your nose  even if you're not sick at all. But luckily, even if you are sick, most sinus infections do go away with time. The important thing to figure out is whether your symptoms are caused by pregnancy or an actual infection, so be sure to talk to your doctor.

When Does Breast Milk Form?,https://www.thebump.com/a/when-does-breast-milk-form,"During the second trimester, increased levels of hormones will stimulate the production of milk in the mammary glands as well as the growth of milk ducts in your breasts. (Milk ducts are lobes in your mammary gland at the tip of the nipple.) But its not until after you deliver that youll begin full-scale milk production.Right after you give birth (but sometimes as early as the second trimester), your breasts produce something called colostrum, which looks like a thick, yellowish fluid. Its full of antibodies and will help strengthen babys immune system. Since baby only needs a small amount of nutrients in these first few days (because of their small tummy size), your body will naturally hold off on allowing actual breast milk to flow until after babys three or four days old. By this point, your body will produce milk in a supply-and-demand-like manner, making as much it needs to based on your breastfeeding patterns.Related Video"

Cystic Fibrosis,https://www.thebump.com/a/cystic-fibrosis,"What is cystic fibrosis in babies?Cystic fibrosis (CF) is an inherited disease that affects the lungs and digestive system. It affects the epithelial cells, which line the lungs, liver, pancreas, digestive tract and reproductive system, and causes those cells to secrete thick, sticky mucus that interferes with the functioning of those organs.That thick mucus can clog up the airways and make patients prone to pneumonia and other respiratory infections. It also gums up the pancreas and interferes with the secretion of enzymes that are important for digestion. As a result, kids with CF have difficulty absorbing nutrients and gaining weight.In the past, people with CF typically died while they were still children. Today, most people with CF live into their 30s, 40s or even 50s.What are the symptoms of cystic fibrosis in babies?The most common symptom of CF in babies and toddlers is failure to gain weight, coupled with frequent large stools. Kids have those symptoms because theyre not absorbing nutrients, because their pancreas cant make the enzymes to absorb them, says Katherine OConnor, MD, a pediatric hospitalist at The Childrens Hospital at Montefiore in New York City.Sometimes, though, CF isnt diagnosed until later in childhood  usually its after a child has experienced years of breathing problems and frequent bouts with pneumonia.Are there any tests for cystic fibrosis in babies?Believe it or not, a sweat test is usually used to detect cystic fibrosis. Kids with CF have high levels of salt in their sweat, so the test checks to see if their sweat is saltier than average.  AdvertisementSome states now screen all newborns for CF. Its important to remember, though, that a positive result on a screening test does not mean that your child has CF; it means that additional testing is needed to figure out whats going on with your child.How common is cystic fibrosis?CF is more common in white kids of northern European ancestry. Approximately 1 out of every 3,000 Caucasian children born in the US has CF. About 1 out of every 17,000 African Americans and 1 out of every 90,000 Asian Americans has CF.How did my baby get cystic fibrosis?CF is an inherited disease caused by a genetic mutation. Both parents have to have the mutated gene for the child to have CF.Whats the best way to treat cystic fibrosis in babies?Children with cystic fibrosis get a lot of treatments to help clear the mucus from their lungs, including saline treatments to help thin the mucus and make it easier to clear, OConnor says. They might also be on chronic antibiotic therapy to keep infections away. Parents may also have to help perform certain maneuvers, such as clapping on the childs chest while the childs head is lowered, to help him clear his lungs.Kids with CF also need medication to replace their missing pancreatic enzymes so that they can effectively digest food. A nutritionist can work with you to help determine the best diet for your child.Other medications, such as antibiotics and meds to help improve breathing, are used as needed. Children with CF may occasionally need to be hospitalized. Some kids may eventually need a feeding tube, lung transplant or other procedure.  AdvertisementWhat can I do to prevent my baby from having cystic fibrosis?If CF runs in your family, you and your spouse might want to consider genetic testing. Genetic testing will tell you if you carry the mutated CF gene. If you both have the mutation, your future kids have a 25 percent chance of having CF.What do other moms do when their babies have cystic fibrosis?It seems like there are some mild cases. My son has some digestive issues and is congested, but hes not having trouble gaining weight. We just got his sweat test result and have been referred to a specialist. I feel like there isn't much info out there, and all there is to look at on the Internet are scary stats.My son has mild CF. Hes two and a half, and the only treatments hes needed so far are nebulizer treatments when he has a cold and occasionally an antibiotic if he has a cold that is sitting in his chest. I havent found a lot of info out there for mild cases like my son, who probably wouldn't have been diagnosed if he were born prior to the newborn screenings being done in my state. He hasn't had any issues with gaining weight or digestive problems.My son was diagnosed at 10 days with CF, and we live in the Chicago area. He's a great and active seven-month-old, and were giving him enzymes, nebulizer and therapy every day to help him out.Are there any other resources for cystic fibrosis?

Fatigue While Pregnant With Multiples?

If youre carrying twins, everything seems to be double  double the hormones, double the stress, double your hunger. And if youre carrying triplets, well, lets just say we completely understand the need for a midday (and morning, and early-evening) nap. Its not just the hormones: Because your body is facing greater demands than even a one-baby pregnancy, youre much more likely to suffer from anemia (iron deficiency), which can make you feel like youve been hit by an 18-wheeler.

These Fertility-Boosting Foods are In Season This Month,https://www.thebump.com/a/fertility-boosting-foods-perfect-for-may,"Getting your daily dose of vitamins and minerals is essential to any healthy diet  especially when youre trying to conceive. Youre probably already eating plenty of fruits, veggies, whole grains and lean proteins which are available throughout the year, but focusing your diet around seasonally-fresh ingredients has even better benefits. Not only is it good for the environment to buy locally (this generally means lower prices too), but when you buy in-season produce, it tastes fresher and is packed with more nutrients.You may think of summer as the ripe time for many fruits and vegetables, but according to James Parker, the associate coordinator for Whole Foods Markets global perishables buying office, thats not the case.In the produce business, we all kind of wish every month was like May. Its a time of intense change, and it marks the official start of the summer tree fruit season, Parker told Time. We also see a tremendous increase in local and regional production throughout the US. Because its domestic season, the product doesnt have to travel as far.May is generally the best time to add these fertility-boosting foods to your shopping cart:Avocados A great way to get your daily dose of folate is through avocados. Folate protects against birth defects in the brain and spine that can develop in the first few weeks of pregnancy. The green, skinned fruit contains vitamin K, which helps your body effectively absorb nutrients while maintaining hormonal balance. Its also high in potassium, a key to regulating blood pressure.  AdvertisementOkay, avocados arent exactly low-cal, but theyre mostly made up of monounsaturated fats (thats the good kind), so one a day is fine. Typically its best to buy organic fruits and vegetables, but you can save a few bucks here since the thick skin makes it hard for pesticides to seep in, says holistic fertility nutritionist Kim Ross.A great way to eat it: Spread one-third of an avocado on multigrain toast and drizzle with olive oil, another known fertility booster. It contains a high concentration of vitamin E, which is known to stabilize and protect cells from oxidative damage, a plus for women with PCOS or diabetes.Berries Blueberries and raspberries are loaded with natural antioxidants and anti-inflammatory phytonutrients, which help boost both female and male fertility. Like citrus, theyre high in folate and vitamin C, which can help with fetal development down the road. Berries are also a good source of fiber and can aid in weight loss (women at a healthier weight tend to have less trouble conceiving), so aim for at least one cup a day.Spinach Eating dark green veggies (like kale and Swiss chard too) is one of the best ways to take in essential prenatal nutrients like calcium, iron (especially important when youre menstruating) and folate, which also protects against birth defects in the brain and spine that can develop in the first few weeks of pregnancy. Since it can take a few weeks to even know youre pregnant, its important to load up on plenty of folate while youre TTC. Most women dont get enough from their diet though, so the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends taking a daily vitamin with folic acid (the synthetic version of folate) to reach the suggested 400 mcg dose.  AdvertisementCitrus Fruits Not only are oranges, grapefruits and other citrus fruits one of the best sources for vitamin C, theyre also packed with potassium, calcium and folate  a B vitamin that can help you get pregnant by regulating ovulation and creating a healthy environment for eggs. You should aim for at least one serving of citrus fruit each day (try a medium-size grapefruit, a large orange, three clementines or one kiwi) in addition to another serving of fruits.For more fertility-boosting foods, visit TheBump.com .PHOTO:ShutterstockRelated Video"
Oligohydramnios,https://www.thebump.com/a/oligohydramnios,"What is oligohydramnios?  Oligohydramnios is when there's not enoughamniotic fluid around baby, and it could mean several things. It could mean your water has broken and some of the fluid has leaked out. Or it could be that baby's not peeing enough (yup, amniotic fluid is made of baby's pee), which could be a sign baby's not getting enough blood and nutrients from the placenta.  What are the signs of oligohydramnios?  You may beleaking fluid (yup, out of your vagina), or your OB may notice that babys not growing or gaining weight as quickly as he should be.  Are there any tests for oligohydramnios?  Yep. An amniotic fluid index or a maximum vertical pocket test can measure your fluid levels.  How common is oligohydramnios?  It happens in about 4 percent of pregnancies  and in 12 percent of pregnancies that go about two weeks past babys due date.  How did I get oligohydramnios?  Certain health problems, such as high blood pressure and diabetes, are associated with oligohydramnios. So are pregnancies that go two or more weeks past the due date. If your membranes break early (premature rupture of membranes) or baby has a birth defect, that could also cause oligohydramnios.How will my oligohydramnios affect my baby? The problem with not having enough fluid is that there may not be enough cushion for the umbilical cord, so it could compress, and baby might not get adequate blood flow from it. Whats the best way to treat oligohydramnios?  How oligohydramnios is treated will depend on what's causing it. It could be as simple as drinking more water or doing less physical activity. You may be asked to stay on bed rest. If you're close to your due date and your doctor is concerned about baby's well-being, she may choose to deliver. If you have low levels of amniotic fluid during labor, your OB may give you an amnioinfusion.  Advertisement  What can I do to prevent oligohydramnios?  In some cases, it may be unavoidable, but see your OB regularly to prevent anyhealth problems that could cause oligohydramnios.  What do other pregnant moms do when they have oligohydramnios?Just had my 20-week ultrasound, and the radiologist said baby looks great, but I have low levels of amniotic fluid. I was referred to a perinatologist for another ultrasound, but in the meantime, Im really worried! My baby has low fluid and theyre watching it...theyre doing a fetal nonstress test Thursday, and my guess is, if he shows any kind of distress at all, theyll deliver. My fluid has gone down more. I know my doctor said once it got under eight centimeters wed have to start talking about what to do. And if it goes under five, my baby will have to be delivered. The suspicion is that my placenta is deteriorating as a result of one of the medications Im on.  Are there any other resources for oligohydramnios?

Staying hydrated during pregnancy?,https://www.thebump.com/a/staying-hydrated-during-pregnancy,"Hydration is always important, and during pregnancy those fluids are even more precious than usual. Your body needs water to formamniotic fluid, produce extra blood volume, build new tissue, carry nutrients, help indigestion, and flush out your wastes and toxins. (Babys, too!) Drinking lots of fluids during pregnancy can work wonders, easing constipation (and therefore hemorrhoids), softening skin, reducing edema and decreasing risk of both urinary tract infections and preterm labor. Its a good idea to get eight cups each day, and if its hot or if youve been exercising, you probably need even more.If the thought of all that water makes you grimace, don't worry  youre free to include other fluids. Milk, juice, soup, sparkling water,tea and coffee (decaf only!) all count, and fruits and veggies even add to the tally (five servings of produce = two servings of fluid).PHOTO:Russell Sadur / Getty ImagesRelated Video"
Exercising While Pregnant,https://www.thebump.com/a/exercising-while-pregnant,"Youve probably heard that pregnancy and labor and delivery will be easier if youre in good shape, but your first trimester isnt the time to start a whole new workout routine. If you already work out regularly, its usually okay to keep up with whatever you're doing through your first trimester, but be sure to check with your doctor to make sure. If you haven't been hitting the gym much lately you'll want to ease into it. The best exercise regimen for the first trimester? Walking and stretching on a daily basis. Heres why a low-impact routine is the way to go:1. During pregnancy, your blood volume increases by a whopping 50 percent. As a result of all this extra blood circulating in your body, your heart rate is highereven at restand exercise may feel more difficult, especially in the first trimester. This additional blood volume also causes you to take deeper, faster breaths and lowers your blood pressure.2. Cardiac output also increases. In fact, its 30 to 40 percent higher than it was before you got pregnant. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, you can safely engage in 30 minutes or more of moderate exercise on most, if not all, days. Walking, swimming, riding a stationary bike, using an elliptical and low-impact aerobics are perfect cardio options as your pregnancy progresses, since these activities don't put any pressure on your joints, loose ligaments or pelvic floor. Listen to your body and make sure your rate of perceived exertion (RPE) is around 7. Try the talk test: If you cannot hold a conversation while exercising, you're working out too hard and need to slow down or lower the intensity to bring your RPE down.  Advertisement3. Your heart rate will be much higher than before you were pregnant, so its important that you give yourself plenty of time to cool down. It can take up to 15 minutes. Stop exercising if and when you start feeling tired and never work yourself to exhaustion.Need more direction? Try this pregnancy DVD from Tracey Mallett. PHOTO:Getty ImagesRelated Video"
Top 10 Breastfeeding Tips For New Moms The Bump Editors,https://www.thebump.com/a/top-10-breastfeeding-tips-real-moms,"Planning on breastfeeding but not sure what to expect? We asked breastfeeding mamas who've been there to share their best tips, pointers, and words of wisdom for soon-to-be moms. Here's what they had to say:1. Don't be surprised if it hurts (at first)""Breastfeeding HURTS in the beginning. Your nipples are cracked and raw, your boobs are sore, and letdowns can be painful.""  carrotcake06""The first two weeks are the hardest. I remember standing in the shower wondering if it was going to hurt to shower for the next year until I weaned her. Now (after 10 months) it's not nearly as painful as it was those first weeks.""  MermaidNM2. Practice makes perfect""The answer to most nursing problems? More nursing! And get support  online, in person, professional, other nursing mamas  whatever it takes to get you through the tough spots.""  Nurselorie3. Invest in some comfy nursing tanks and bras (you'll be living in them soon)""Stock up on nursing tanks. They are so easy and you don't have to pull up your shirt. You can layer them under a zip-up, hoodie, or cardigan.""  jkfranklin4. Don't be afraid of nipple shields""I wish someone had told me that nipple shields are not the devil and will not kill your supply. When it is the only way that your newborn will latch, it is okay to use them  and you can wean off of them if you choose.""  Novem064. Moisturize those nips!""Lanolin cream: buy it now. It also works as an excellent lip gloss!""  Kelly M.""If you want to save on nipple cream, try using olive oil and your own breast milk for healing those chapped, painful nipples!""  LindsayQ  Advertisement5. Create a breastfeeding station""Set up a breastfeeding station and know that you could spend up to 10 hours a day there in the beginning. I have a radio, iPod, a large bottle of water, a notebook to track feedings, and wet/dirty diapers a remote control fan in front of us, breast pads, and pillows  I even placed my chair so I can see our TV.""  rohrs556. Don't over-pump right away""Don't pump a stash until your supply is established  you'll create an oversupply that way.""  carrotcake067. Don't be afraid to breastfeed in public""The best thing my baby did to me was force me to nurse in public. Once I had, it didn't feel like that big a deal and was very freeing to feel like I could go anywhere with him and not worry about it.""  Elfgirl""Breastfeed in public however you're most comfortable doing it (with a cover, blanket, etc.). If you're always having to change plans or sit alone, it will feel like much more of a chore.""  tralfmadorianRemember that breastfeeding  even in public  is a beautiful thing, so don't be embarrassed. And that BFing on a Walmart toilet is not as fun as doing it on the bench outside the bathroom!""  Rachel S.8. Look into lactation consultants  before baby comes""Get the number for a lactation consultatnt with a good reputation or the number for your local La Leche League before you have your baby. By the time you're having issues, you may be too upset/tired/frustrated to look up numbers.""  JoyousJulia""We paid $150 for a great LC to come to our house and I don't think we would have been successful breastfeeding without her. It sounds pricey, but compared to the cost of formula, it's so worth it!""  Mainer-in-Texas  Advertisement9. Don't forget to eat!""I got woozy after nursing sessions during the first few weeks and it was because I wasn't consuming enough calories. Baby will get all the nutrients he needs, but it will leave you with nothing. Make good choices about what you're eating  lots of veggies and healthy proteins. I keep snacks and water in my pump bag because I always get hungry or thirsty when I nurse or pump.""  BottomStar""It's so easy in the beginning to be consumed with everything baby and forget to take care of yourself. The problem is, if you forget to eat and drink, you aren't helping your supply to increase at all. You need those extra calories and fluids.""  Marc's Mrs.10. Hydrate, hydrate, hydrate...""It's super-imperative to drink plenty of water. I got lazy with this early on and almost lost all my milk.""  MWoodsideRelated Video"
