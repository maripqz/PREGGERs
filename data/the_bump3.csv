"Prenatal ', <b>Vitamins</b>, u': What You Need To Know",https://www.thebump.com/a/prenatal-vitamins-what-you-need-to-know,"For years, OBs have routinely given pregnant women prescriptions for specialized prenatal vitamins at their first prenatal visit. Now, more and more doctors are advising women to pump up their supplements even before they conceive. And with some prenatal vitamin formulas now available without a prescription, thats easier than ever to do. But what to take?Women of childbearing age should be sure to get enough folic acid, iron, and calciumthree essential nutrients for keeping a woman and her developing baby healthy, advises Siobhan Dolan, MD, MPH, Associate Professor of Clinical Obstetrics & Gynecology and Women's Health at Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Dont wait for your doctor to give you a prescription [for prenatal vitamins] at your first prenatal visit; start taking them at least one month before you get pregnant.The catch: Who knows when its one month before youll get pregnant?The nutrients you needTurns out you may be able to get whats most crucial for the development of a healthy baby from a regular one-a-day multivitamin. According to the March of Dimes, a non-profit group that works to prevent birth defects, taking 400 micrograms of folic acid every day in addition to what you get in a balanced diet, before and just after conception, can prevent up to 70 percent of neural tube defects (problems with the developing babys brain or spine that can be devastating). That amount is found in many one-a-day multivitamin/mineral formulas, especially in those designed for women.During pregnancy, you also may need more iron and calcium; and since you probably wont know youre pregnant for the earliest weeks, its a good idea to start boosting your intake of both these minerals as soon as you start trying. For iron, the recommended intake for adult women is 18 milligrams per day, and thats what youll find in most multivitamins. Pregnant women need more27 milligrams dailyand thats typically the threshold for prenatal formulas.  AdvertisementWhen it comes to calcium, even prescription supplements often dont match up to the levels of calcium that nutrition experts recommend for women approaching childbearing age, which is 1000 milligrams each day. That level of calcium makes a multivitamin pill too large. Taking a separate calcium supplement is one option, as is taking an over-the-counter prenatal formula, which sometimes has more calcium than the prescription versions. And women should be sure to get plenty of calcium in their diets, from dairy products and leafy greens.Experiment with formulasYou may have to try several formulas before you find one you like. Some may upset your stomach (particularly formulas high in iron). Others may be too large to swallow easily.Theres no standardization in prenatal formulas. Manufacturers can choose whether to make their product available with or without a prescription. They can include longer or shorter lists of vitamins and minerals, and even herbs. Theres no consistency in the list or amount of ingredients from brand to brand. Because the preparations can vary so much, its up to you to be informed: read the labels, talk to your doctor and pharmacist, and choose the best pill for you. The right one will depend on your diet, your tolerance for different pills, and whether or not your insurance covers prescription pills (if it does, they may be the least expensive option).If you choose an over-the-counter brand, the March of Dimes recommends looking for USP on the labelthat indicates that the vitamins have been given a stamp of approval from the U.S. Pharmacopeia, an organization that checks safety and quality. Read labels carefully. You may find that the once-a-day multivitamin youre already taking contains the vitamins and minerals you need right now.Related Video"
"The ', <b>Vitamins</b>, u"" You'll Need to Conceive",https://www.thebump.com/a/vitamins-you-need-to-conceive,"Ever wonder if theres something you should be getting more of now that youre trying to get pregnant? Well, there's actually a few things. According to Natalie Burger, MD, a fertility specialist at Texas Fertility Center, good nutrition can help you get pregnant and prep your body for baby. Here are the vitamins you should take:ZincNewsflash: You and your partner should be getting plenty of zinc. Zinc contributes to ovulation and fertility in women and also semen and testosterone production in men, according to the American Pregnancy Association. It has been noted that zinc deficiency can correlate with impaired sperm production, says Burger. The Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health recommends that men receive a daily intake of 11 mg of zinc and women take 8 mg. Oysters have more zinc per serving than any other food, but if the thought of those slimy shells don't appeal to you, you can also consume other zinc-rich foods like whole grains, crab and lobster, beans and dairy products.Folic acidThis one is a must-have. The American Pregnancy Association recommends that all women of childbearing age consume about 400 micrograms of folic acid a day. Folic acid is a B-complex vitamin that is used by the body to create red blood cells. This vitamin makes extra blood for your body during pregnancy and it decreases the possibility of aneural tube defect (a problem in babys spinal cord). Folic acid is the synthetic form of this vitamin, while folate is the naturally occurring form; both are okay to use. Since babys neural tube develops in the first few weeks of pregnancy, its important to be prepared. Both zinc and folate are important in the synthesis of DNA and RNA, says Burger. Zinc and folate supplementation may benefit some male infertility cases. You can get your daily intake of folic acid from citrus fruits, whole grains and leafy greens.  AdvertisementMultivitaminsIf youre already taking a multivitamin, youre in good shape. If youre not, start taking one now. In a large study following over 18,000 women who were trying to get pregnant, researchers found a correlation between taking a multivitamin supplement and having a lower chance of ovulation problems, says Burger.Coenzyme Q10Studies show that taking supplements of Coenzyme Q10 (CoQ10) may help with both female and male infertility. Preliminary animal data has suggested that the addition of CoQ10 may improve egg quality in old mice, says Burger. The correlating human study is ongoing. There is also evidence that CoQ10 can increase sperm count. According to the Mayo Clinic, CoQ10 is produced by the body and is necessary for the basic functioning of cells. For adults, the recommended daily dosage is 30 - 200 mg in divided doses throughout the day.Omega 3 Free Fatty AcidTake this essential fatty acid found in fish oil or certain plant or nut oils if youre undergoing IVF treatments. Your body cant make omega 3 fatty acid; you have to get it through food. Increased omega 3 free fatty acid intake has been associated with improved embryo quality in an IVF study done in the Netherlands, says Burger.IronStart increasing the amount of iron in your diet now if you are not getting enough. Womens recommended iron intake is 18 mg a day, but pregnant women need around 27 mg daily. Iron is used to make hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells. If your body doesnt have enough iron, your bodys tissues and organs wont get the oxygen they need to function properly. You can normally get this amount in your multivitamin, but you can also find iron in foods like red meat, tofu and dark leafy green vegetables.  AdvertisementCalciumNutrition experts recommend that women looking to get pregnant should consume around 1,000 mg a day, because when you do become pregnant your growing baby will need calcium. Actually, its also recommended that all adults between ages 19 and 50 consume that amount of calcium in order to form strong bones and prevent osteoporosis. Thats a crazy amount  even for a multivitamin! You can take a separate calcium supplement or take an over-the-counter prenatal formula. Working calcium into your diet isnt a bad idea either: Drink lots of milk and eat leafy greens.Vitamin B6Take this vitamin now to head offnasty pregnancy symptoms after you conceive. Research suggests that women who consumed at least 10 mg of vitamin B6 before they conceived reported less morning sickness than those who didnt.Pass these to your partnerIn addition to zinc and CoQ10, guys who are trying to conceive can also take the following vitamins to boost their fertility:AntioxidantsTaking these supplements like vitamin C and vitamin E may help with fertility. In a small Spanish study comparing fertile and infertile men, a low intake of antioxidant nutrients was associated with poor semen quality, says Burger. You can take these vitamins in pill form or consume foods like oranges and strawberries (for vitamin C) and almonds and sunflower seeds (for vitamin E).L-carnitineIts a substance that serves as an energy source for sperm and it plays an important role in sperm maturation and metabolism, says Burger. The addition of L-carnitine may enhance sperm motility in some male factor infertility cases. You can get L-carnitine in supplement form.

Theres no one time of day thats better for absorption or anything like that, so thats not something to be concerned about.But if your prenatal vitamin consistently makes you feel nauseous, you should try taking it during a meal.

"Q&A: Does my baby need ', <b>vitamins</b>, u'?",https://www.thebump.com/a/does-my-baby-need-vitamins,"Most vitamins a baby needs are provided by breastfeeding. The issue is with vitamin D. Breast milk never was meant to provide vitamin D. You get vitamin D when your skin is exposed to sunlight  that can provide an awful lot of vitamin D. So if your baby gets sunlight on his skin (even in winter, even if it's cloudy but not through a window pane), he will get vitamin D. But if you are vitamin D deficient (likely if you don't get sun exposure or if you always wear sunblock or are dark-skinned), you should, of course, correct this by taking your own supplements, but it might be wise to supplement the baby with vitamin D as he may not have received adequate amounts during the pregnancy.Related Video"
"How To Tell If Your Toddler Needs ', <b>Vitamin</b>, u' Supplements",https://www.thebump.com/a/vitamins-for-toddler,"Toddlers should eat a balanced diet: about three-fourths to one cup of fruits and veggies, one-fourth cup of grains and three tablespoons of meat (or another protein) per day. If your toddler isnt eating that much on an almost regular basis, or is skipping certain food groups all together, its a good idea to talk to your pediatrician about a multivitamin. Your pediatrician can also help you decide what vitamin, or form, is most appropriate for your child. (Kids vitamins come in all kinds of forms: from liquids to chewables to gummy vitamins.)Many toddlerseven good eaterstake an iron supplement because iron intake tends to drop off during the toddler years. As babies, many toddlers ate iron-fortified cereals or drank iron-fortified formula. It can be hard for young kids to meet their daily iron intake when they switch over to cows milk and table food. Talk to your doctor about iron supplementation; he or she will let you know if they think its necessary for your child.Some parents choose fiber supplements but theyre actually rarely needed. Toddlers can (and should) get their fiber intake from eating raw fruits and veggies, so serve some at every meal. If your child becomes constipated, increase his or her fruit intake by serving fruit as a dessert after dinner and as a bedtime snack.Plus, more from The Bump:Healthy Recipes for One-Year-OldsHow to Grocery Shop for Your ToddlerAdvice for Healthy Toddler EatingRelated Video"

"Is My Prenatal ', <b>Vitamin</b>, u' Causing My Constipation?",https://www.thebump.com/a/prenatal-vitamin-causing-constipation,"Constipation is a common problem for pregnant women. During pregnancy, high levels of progesterone slow the movement of food through your digestive track, and as your bump grows, the pressure from your uterus onto your rectum only makes things worse. And yes, it can be made worse by the iron in your prenatals.If you suspect the iron levels in your vitamin are to blame, check the label  you probably don't need more than 30 milligrams of iron a day, unless you're anemic. (If your prenatal has more, ask your doctor if you can switch.) To help the problem, make sure you're getting at least eight cups (64 ounces) of water each day (juice and decaf tea are good options too). Also, add more fiber-rich foods to your diet, such as whole grains, beans, veggies and fruit. But as you increase your fiber, be sure to increase your fluids  otherwise, your tummy will just feel worse! Make an effort to stay active  the more you move, the more your bowels will too.

Pregnancy Prep For Moms-to-Be Erin van Vuuren,https://www.thebump.com/a/pregnancy-prep-for-moms-to-be,"Thinking about making a baby? The most popular months to deliver are July, August, and September, so if you want to join the throngs of summertime mommies next year, fall's the time to get busy. Many woman can get pregnant without a word of advice, but if you're eager to speed things along, here are a few tips.Re-learn the female anatomyIf you paid attention in biology class, you can skip this one. If not, here's a basic refresher: You have ovaries. Your ovaries contain eggs. Sometime in the midst of your menstrual cycle (on average, around 14 days after your period starts), your ovaries release an egg, which starts a several-day journey toward your uterus (aka womb). If a sperm is hanging around and manages to hook up with the egg, you get pregnant. If not, your body flushes out the egg with a menstrual period. End of lesson.Know your oddsDon't stress if you don't get pregnant right away. After all, you've only got about a 20 percent chance each time you ovulate. Seriously, you only have about a three-day window of fertility each cycle. You have to have sex at just the right time, and the sperm has to swim a long, long way to seal the deal. There's no need to call the doc unless you've been trying to conceive for a year or more (or six months, if you're over 35).Take your vitaminsIt's best to start popping prenatal vitamins at least two months before you start trying, and you should start getting at least 400 mcg of folic acid each day as far as a year or two in advance.

Occasionally, some moms maytemporarily need to take iron due to a large amount of blood loss during delivery.However, most moms leave the hospital with normal hemagloblin levels and willnot require iron supplementation.

10 Pregnancy Foods To Eat For Baby Kristin Koch,https://www.thebump.com/a/10-pregnancy-foods-to-eat-for-baby,"EggsWhat it's got: Whether you like them fried, scrambled, hard-boiled or served as an omelet, eggs are the gold standard for prenatal protein. They also happen to be a great source of folate, iron and choline.Why it's good for both of you: Not only are eggs a relatively cheap, versatile and convenient source of protein, but they contain choline too. Never heard of that last one? Choline is critical to fetal brain development and reduces the risk of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida. But to reap the benefits, you'll have to eat the whole thing (so forget the egg-whites-only order); choline is contained in the yolk. If your cravings are more for a burger than eggs Benedict, youre in luck  there's also choline in beef. Bonus: Give baby a brain boost by buying eggs fortified with omega-3s.Sweet PotatoesWhat it's got: Don't just save these guys for Thanksgiving  sweet potatoes are full of nutritious fiber, vitamin B6, potassium (even more than bananas have!), vitamin C and iron, as well as copper and beta-carotene.Why it's good for both of you: Sure, other foods on our list offer many of the same nutrients, but we're singling out sweet potatoes for their beta-carotene  an antioxidant that your body converts to vitamin A. And as you may recall, vitamin A plays an important role in the development of baby's eyes, bones and skin. Sweet potatoes are also a great way to meet your iron quota. Not only do these orange spuds contain iron, but they also have copper  a mineral that helps your body absorb iron. So swap in sweet potatoes for your usual sides; they're great mashed, baked or French-fried (um, yum!)  AdvertisementNutsWhat they've got: This crunchy (and convenient) snack is full of healthy fats (including those brain-boosting omega-3s we mentioned earlier), protein, fiber and a variety of vitamins and minerals. Plus, noshing on nuts will help make a dent in the 800 milligrams of magnesium you're supposed to get now that you're preggers.Why they're good for both of you: Munching on magnesium-rich foods helps reduce the risk of premature labor and aids in the development of your baby's nervous system. A quarter cup of almonds contains 98 milligrams of magnesium, so keep a stash in your purse for a convenient prenatal power snack on the go. Cravings control: If you feel like a bottomless pit these days, try noshing on shelled pistachios. They take longer to eat, giving your body more time to register that it's full.Beans and LentilsWhat they've got: If you're not a big meat eater (or one at all), beans and lentils are great sources of protein and iron, as well as folate, fiber and calcium. And beans (especially baked ones) are also bursting with zinc.Why they're good for both of you: Beans boast a bunch of the baby- and mom-friendly minerals found in animal products, so they're a great option for vegetarian and vegan moms-to-be. Beans are also rich in zinc  an essential mineral that's linked to a lower risk for preterm delivery, low birth weight and prolonged labor. Beans bother your stomach? Other great sources of zinc include meat, chicken, milk, fortified cereals, cashews, peas, crab and oysters (just don't eat them raw!).  AdvertisementLean MeatWhat it's got: Sure, you know it's a great source of protein, but lean beef and pork are also packed with iron and B vitamins.Why it's good for both of you: Your body needs a lot more protein now (about 25 extra grams a day) to help the fetus grow and to ensure his or her muscles develop properly. Same goes for iron: Not getting enough of this mineral can impair baby's growth and increase the risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight. Iron is important for mom, too  it's necessary for red blood cell formation (to prevent anemia). During pregnancy, your blood volume increases, so you'll need to up your iron intake (to around 27 milligrams a day). Bonus: Meat supplies a hefty dose of vitamins B6 (helps baby's tissue and brain growth, while easing mom's morning sickness) and B12 (helps to maintain healthy nerves and red blood cells).Orange JuiceWhat it's got: Down a glass in the morning to fill up on folate, potassium and, of course, vitamin C.Why it's good for both of you: You've probably heard a lot of buzz about folate and folic acid (the synthetic form that you get in supplements and fortified foods), and with good reason: It's a necessary nutrient for preventing certain birth defects early on in pregnancy and for ensuring a healthy pregnancy after that, so try to get about 600 micrograms a day. The potassium in OJ is important for keeping your muscle function, metabolism and overall health in check. Like iron, pregnant women need to consume more potassium, because of their expanding blood volume. And as you already know, orange juice is an excellent source of vitamin C, which, in addition to fighting colds, helps your body better absorb iron and keeps both your and baby's teeth and bones healthy.  AdvertisementYou can also get your vitamin C from broccoli, tomatoes, strawberries, red peppers and a variety of citrus fruits, including another prenatal power food  mangoes, which are packed with more than 20 different vitamins and minerals. Bonus: Opt for OJ that's fortified with vitamin D, which increases blood circulation in the placenta and aids in calcium absorption so that your baby will have stronger bones.YogurtWhat it's got: Surprise! Plain yogurt actually contains even more calcium than milk. Plus, it's got essential bone-building nutrients, including protein, B vitamins and zinc.Why it's good for both of you: Calcium is essential for keeping your bones and teeth healthy and helping baby to develop his or hers, and skimping on this key nutrient could put you both at risk. Expectant moms should get at least three servings of calcium a day to reduce the risk of low birth weight and preterm delivery. If your calcium count comes up short, your body will take the calcium baby needs from your bones, putting you at greater risk for osteoporosis later on. Bonus: Snack on Greek yogurt topped with fruit for double the protein (and fiber) punch.OatmealWhat it's got: Those oats are filled with fiber, protein and vitamin B6.Why it's good for both of you: Start your morning off right with a nice big bowl of oatmeal. Whole grains are great for keeping your energy levels up, especially if morning sickness has you feeling a bit drained. Plus, all that fiber will help with another pregnancy pleasantry: constipation. But the benefits don't just stop with mom. This convenient breakfast dish (yep, the instant kind is great too!) also contains protein and vitamin B6, both of which are important for baby's development. Bonus: Look for a variety that's fortified with iron, B vitamins and folic acid.  AdvertisementLeafy GreensWhat it's got: You had to know these guys were gonna make the list. Chock-full of antioxidants and nutrients, dark-green veggies  including spinach, asparagus, broccoli and kale  should really be on everyone's plates.Why it's good for both of you: These super foods are especially important for moms-to-be and developing babies. That's because, in addition to all those antioxidants, leafy greens supply calcium, potassium, fiber and folate, plus another important nutrient we haven't told you about yet: vitamin A. Because of its role in helping baby's eyesight develop and aiding in bone and skin growth, it's important for moms to nosh on vitamin A-filled foods too. No midnight cravings for asparagus or spinach? Oranges are also a great source.SalmonWhat it's got: This oily fish is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids and protein.Why it's good for both of you: Forget about preordering Baby Einstein DVDs  just incorporate salmon into your diet over the next nine months. The omega-3 fatty acids (aka DHA and EPA) in fish help baby's brain to develop, and higher levels of DHA in newborns have even been associated with higher IQs, advanced motor skills and fewer neurological problems later on. Omega-3s are good for the development of baby's eyes, too, and salmon is also a great source of lean protein for moms-to-be. Worried about seafood? Salmon's low in mercury and considered safe for expectant moms, but limit your intake to two servings of six ounces or less each week to be safe. Just not feeling fish right now? Snack on walnuts and almonds.

Unsafe Foods For Nursing Moms,https://www.thebump.com/a/unsafe-food-for-nursing-moms,"Fortunately, you don't need to change your diet too much while breastfeedingall the vitamins you take in will naturally go to your breast milk first. This means it's nearly impossible to deprive baby of what they need. However, there are a few things that you should cut down on while baby's nursing.FishYou don't need to completely cut out fish, but the FDA recommends that nursing women (as well as those trying to conceive or pregnant) should limit fish intake because of its mercury content. Can't do without a good tuna sandwich now and then? Just remember that the FDA advises no more than six ounces of canned albacore (""white"" tuna) a week.AlcoholOpinions on this one are mixed, but the American Academy of Pediatrics says alcohol in moderation (one or two drinks a week) is fine, while the March of Dimes recommends against drinking any alcohol while breastfeeding. Either way, you definitely need to keep an eye on your intake. Alcohol may make it harder for your body to product breast milk, and trace amounts can show up in your milk and may harm or bother baby. If you do have the occasional drink, wait at least two hours afterwards before nursing baby.CaffeineYour morning cup of coffee is fine, but don't go overboard. Too much caffeine can lead to a fussy baby who doesn't want to sleep. (Meaning you'll need more caffeine to stay up with her... meaning she'll be even less into sleep... meaning you'll need more... you see where this is going, no?) Remember, caffeine can be found in soda and tea as well as some of those over-the-counter medications you may be taking for common ailments. Just to be safe, always read the label.  AdvertisementSpiceThough your diet doesn't need to be completely bland, you might need to forfeit some flavor... especially if you're a lover of foods with a kick. Too much spice can make baby gassy and uncomfortable, so play it safe and avoid foods strongly seasons with spices like garlic or chili powder. Of course, every baby is different, so if yours doesn't seem bothered by spice, it's fine to indulge now and then.Vitamin CWe wouldn't normally knock a vitamin, but this one has actually been linked to mild diaper rash in babies. Watch vitamin C rich foods, especially fruits like oranges and grapefruits. You don't need to completely avoid the vitamin, but be especially careful if you notice that baby seems to react after you eat citrus.Looking for foods you can eat?

Top 10 Things They Should Warn You About Before You Get Pregnant,https://www.thebump.com/a/things-no-one-warned-you-about-pregnancy,"You hear about the morning sickness, the wacky cravings, and even the swollen ankles before you get pregnant. But lets be real, thosesymptoms are childs play when it comes to what youll really have to deal with. We asked Bumpies to spill even the most TMI symptoms they wish theyd known were coming. (FYI: You may want to put down anything you may be munching on rightaboutnow.) 1. You might grow a beard.I didnt know my prenatal vitamins would make my facial hair grow out of control! megi616Okay, so maybe were exaggerating a tad. You probably wont be sporting a full-on beard (hopefully!), but facialhair growth in general is a very real pregnancy symptomso be on guard. Your raging hormones can be blamed for this one, since theyre whats causing your hair to grow at super-fast speeds and maybe even in some new (and embarrassing) places. But at the end of the day, its a small price to pay for baby; so buy a home waxing kit and remember: it will all end soon. 2. Taking a good poop could feel like a distant memory.I never thought Id have constipation so severe that it makes me feel like I had a major ab workout the day after pushing HRMJPCSadly,constipation plagues many moms-to-be throughout their pregnancies, since the flow of hormones can make your belly muscles relax, and turn pooping into a rough process. Your uterus is also growing and putting added pressure on your bowels, which may be yet another factor why things arent quite in working order. Try to fight back by adding in more fiber to your diet, drinking more water, keeping active, staying on top of your prenatals, and living by the motto When you gotta go, you gotta go   Advertisement3. Youll have insane gas you cant even blame on the dog.My gas would make a trucker blush. 2becomes3Let us just start with: It happens to the best of us. With that said, crazypregnancy gas is unfortunately not always something you can avoid. With your body working double-time making hormones like progesterone and relaxin, muscle tissue around your bod will start to relax  especially around your GI tract. This causes the food you eat to move through your system more slowly, thereby causing you to bloat. Altogether, these factors can prove to be a pretty nasty combo. Our advice: Lay off the gassy foods for awhile, since theyll just add to your troubles. Other than that, all you can do is grin and bear itand hope that your partners a good sport.4: Two words: Uncontrollable drooling.No one told me about all the extra saliva that would wind up all over my pillow after waking up! B3BrideNighttime drooling certainly isnt sexy, but hey, sometimes you just cant avoid it. Nobody knows why for sure, but its pretty common for your hormones to cause your body to produce waymore saliva than normal when youre pregnant. This can definitely lead to some pretty gross situations on your pillow, but also be embarrassing during the daytime, too  because yes, the drooling isnt just a problem at night. So what can you do? Brush your teeth more often, swish around some minty mouthwash, and pop in some sugar-free gum to try and get dry in the mouth. 5. Youll burp like a frat boy.I dont just have little burps I have full-on if-I-dont-release-the-valve-Im-gonna-hurl kind of belching."" AndriaKay  AdvertisementIf youre burping like crazy these days, chances are its for the same reasons that youre so gassy. Everythings getting a bit crowded in there, making it hard to avoid some of the nasty side-effects and discomfort. But at least baby doesnt feel your pain. Yep, thats right, even though you may be letting out teenaged-boy-style burps, baby remains blissfully unaware of all your gas problems from inside your belly. Though you may not be able to get rid of the burping altogether, all you can do is steer clear of drinks with a lot of fizz (aka soda) and hope for the best.6. Grooming your lady bits could become the bane of your existence.No one told me that one day, you wont be able to see your vagina, therefore you wont be able to give yourself a trim and will become a hairy beast. shanmoyerSad but true: With your belly growing by the minute, its inevitable that there will come a time when you wont be able to see whats going on down thereor tend to it. And this definitely presents problems when it comes to personal grooming, since (as weve already established), your body kicks things up a notch in the hair growth department when youre pregnant. If youre going into panic mode about what someone might encounter down there if you dont get things taken care of, stat, youre not alone. But that doesnt mean there isnt hopeits time to start shopping around town for a good waxer. Trust us, youll thank us later.7: There will be discharge. And lots of it.Oh, the huge amounts of discharge  I was so not prepared to feel wet the entire third trimester. Cullum13Gross, we know. But its the truth.Your bod is making way more estrogen now and causing more blood to flow down to your lady bits, which means excessdischarge is bound to happen. And while its totally normal, it sure aint pretty. So if you havent already been introduced, its time to meet your new best friend: the pantiliner. Youre welcome.   Advertisement8.The term lightening crotch will become a painful reality.I refer to it as the Cooter Basher. It feels like someone came up to you and used your vag for batting practice. aliciamarieNext to labor, you really havent felt true pain until youve been kicked in the vagina by your unborn baby. Of course, there are lots of different possibilities for why this might be happening to you, depending on what stage ofpregnancy youre at. It could be due to babys repositioning in your uterus, or maybe what youre feeling is some early Braxton Hicks contractions. Whatever the case, lightning crotch pretty much happens to all of us and isnt necessarily a sign of anything bad. Consider it a rite of passage and try working on looking less shocked when it happens in public (because it will). 9. Kindergarten wasnt the last time youll pee your pants in public.""I pee my pants every time I gag, cough, or sneeze."" mrosekepple Its true, snissing as its affectionately known on TheBump.com message boards, is an annoying and sometimes embarrassing side-effect in the later stages of pregnancy. Babys resting on a lot of internal organs in there, including your bladder, which is why your body cant help but leak a little. But dont worry, you wont need to throw on a pair of Depends any time soon. A mini-pad or even a pantiliner should do the trick for now, along with a good sense of humor. 10. Your vagina will actually grow. (Yes, grow.)""At the end of my pregnancy, my girl parts swelled up so big I could barely move my legs around to walk. DoDoDIts a scary thought, but yes, your vagina lips could likely get biggereven swell a bitas you near that nine-month mark. No, its not pretty (whoever said pregnancy was?), but it doesnt happen to everyone and it shouldnt last too long. In short: Your bodys producing more blood now that youre pregnant, and trying to re-route most of it to your uterus, so baby can get enough nourishment. Unfortunately, your vagina may bear the brunt of the increased bloodflow youre getting down there, which is whats leaving you feeling tender or sore.

Breastfeeding Diet: Tips For New Moms,https://www.thebump.com/a/breastfeeding-diet-1,"Sure, youve heard breast is best. But have you ever thought about how the food you eat while breastfeeding affects baby? And what about getting rid of the baby weight? Can you diet while still safely nourishing your newborn? Well, were here to help you get to the bottom of all your post-pregnancy diet concerns. To start, theres good news for your evolving body: Making all that milk means youre burning about 500 calories a day if youre exclusively breastfeeding. Thats the equivalent of running about five miles at a good clipexcept you can do it from the comfort of your chair while snuggling up with baby! And even better, it doesnt have to be all or nothing. If youre supplementing with formula, youll still burn through about 300 extra calories a day, says Jessica Cording, a registered dietitian who works with new moms in her New York City practice.And though it may not feel like it right now, thanks to breastfeeding, you can (and likely will) lose weight. You do naturally when youre breastfeeding, Cording says. Its helping the uterus shrink down, your metabolism is firing, and it happens without even having to obsess over calories. If youre anxious to slip back into those pre-pregnancy jeans, its fine to start watching what you eat. Just beware of overly restrictive diets that sap your energy and, worse, might even mess with your ability to produce the milk baby needs. In one study, women were able to eat as few as 1,500 calories a day without impacting their milk output, but once they dipped below that number their production shrank by 15 percent. I generally encourage moms to take it slow and steady, Cording says. Sometimes if were being overly restrictive with our calorie intake, youre missing out on important nutrients that mom and baby really need.  AdvertisementBreastfeeding super nutrients you need nowGenerally youll need about 500 calories more per day to make up for what you burn while breastfeeding, but the best diet for breastfeeding doesnt just require more calories. Since you now have to share all the vitamins and minerals you eat with baby, maximizing nutrition is the name of the game. Here are the key nutrients youll want to incorporate into your daily meals.ProteinYou need about 15 more grams of protein than you did before you were pregnant, Cording says. Try this breastfeeding diet tip so you know youre getting enough: Take your weight, cut it in half and add 15. Thats about how many grams of protein you should aim for each day. Or a simpler strategy is just to include some protein in every meal or snack.CarbohydratesNows not the time to go low-carb, Cording says, especially if youre short on sleep. Your energy levels and hormones are in a state of flux, and making sure you have some carbohydrates for your body to work with will help you stay more energized. Youll need about 210 grams a day, or about 60 percent more than before you were pregnant. So make sure your breastfeeding diet includes some type of healthy carbit could be a fruit, whole grain, veggies, pasta or dairy productat each meal or snack. And as you probably already know, skip the white carbs and do your best to reach for healthy, higher-fiber carbs thatll keep you full longer and pack an extra-nutritious punch.Folic acidYou already know how important folic acid is during pregnancy, but its just as important for your postpartum diet too. Your baby is still developing, so those same things are still very important, Cording says. Breastfeeding moms should aim for .5 mgs per day. A great source: greens like spinach and kale. Its kind of a clich, but these leafy greens are good for just about everything, Cording says. Youll also find it in fortified breads and pastas as well as oranges and sesame seeds.  AdvertisementOmega-3 fatty acidsWe often immediately think of fish for omega-3s, which are important for babys brain developmentbut theyre hardly your only source. You can also find these healthy fats in grass-fed beef and dairy, chia seeds, walnuts and free-range eggs. Shoot for 200 to 300 mg of omega-3s per day, or the amount in one to two servings of fish a week. (Just steer clear of high-mercury seafoodsee below for more details).CalciumWhile you dont actually need more calcium while youre breastfeeding, its important that you fill your quota of about 1,000 mg. Its normal to lose about 3 to 5 percent of your bone mass during breastfeeding (dont worry, it comes back after you wean), but you want to make sure your bones dont take a bigger hit than they need to. Luckily, unlike baby, youve got plenty more options to pick from than milk. Add salmon, sardines (or any fish with little bones in it), broccoli, bok choy and tofu to your breastfeeding diet meal plan.IronMost women dont need extra iron while breastfeeding, but if you lost blood during your delivery or after, you might. Check with your doctor to see how much daily iron he or she recommends. Red meat is the easiest way to get your fill, but vegans and vegetarians have options too. Dried beans, peas and (again) dark leafy greens will all help you get the iron you need with or without meat on the menu.Breastfeeding foods to put on your watch listNow that youve safely ushered baby into the world, there are fewer no-nos when it comes to what you can eat. So, can you eat sushi while youre breastfeeding? Yep! If youve been craving your weekly fix these past nine months, go ahead and put it back on your breastfeeding diet menu. But dont forget that what you eat and drink still gets filtered through to baby, so there are some foods to avoid or limit while breastfeeding.   AdvertisementAlcoholOkay, so after nine months of just saying no, you're probably wondering what the word is on your postpartum drink order. Like so many things about raising babies, the amount of alcohol thats safe for baby is up for debate. A small percentage of the alcohol you drink does go into your breast milk. And just as your body naturally metabolizes alcohol from your bloodstream, it will also clear from your breast milk after about two to three hours per serving. While some women believe they can just pump and dump to help remove alcohol from their breast milk after having a drink, this is actually a myth. Only time gets rid of the tainted milk. As expected, there are lots of opinions on the topic. While some experts recommend being a teetotalerwhen it comes to baby you never can be too safeothers find that approach to be overly strict. After all, the amount of alcohol that makes it into your breast milk is equivalent to about 5 to 6 percent of the strength, relative to baby's size, and drinking small amounts hasnt been shown to be harmful. If you do decide to drink up, the experts agree on one thing: Make it two drinks or less, and always wait those allotted number of hours before you nurse or pump. The bigger risk with drinking is likely caring for baby safely, so make sure if you do indulge in a little happy hour fun, someone else is available to help. And never share a bed with baby after drinking.  AdvertisementCaffeineIf, say, caffeine is your must-have to function like a human, the rules are much more liberal. Thats right, it is safe to drink coffee while breastfeeding. Woot! Less than one percent of the caffeine in your venti latte makes it into your breast milk, so as much as three eight-ounce cups (about 750 mg of caffeine), spread throughout the day, is considered safe for you and baby. Keep in mind some babies are sensitive to caffeine, though, so if you find babys especially fussy, jittery or prone to waking up more than usual, try decreasing your intake of caffeinated drinks and foods (yep, that means chocolate too) and see if that makes a difference.High-mercury seafoodFish is a great food to include in your dietin fact the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfeeding moms eat it once or twice a week. But both pregnant and breastfeeding moms should steer clear of seafood thats high in mercury, like shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish. Your best bet with all fish, Cording says, is to mix it up: Have your tuna salad (canned albacore is higher in mercury) once or twice a week, but go for salmon (which tends to be lower in mercury) another day.Making milk: How to pump up your outputStruggling with supply? Nursing (or pumping) frequently is the best way to make sure you keep up your milk. But if youre looking for alternative ways to try and boost supply, certain breastfeeding foods are rumored to help with milk production. Even though theres little hard evidence that they really work, it cant hurt to tryespecially if lactation cookies are on the menu, right?  AdvertisementOatmealDoesnt matter how you eat this breakfast of championsslow cooked, quick or even baked into cookiesoatmeal is a smart go-to for milk-making moms. I recommend finding ways to add it to non-breakfast things too, Cording says. Put it into meatballs instead of breadcrumbs. Or stir it into yogurt. It helps with supply and keeps your energy levels consistent. No research has proven it works, but oats pack protein, fiber and iron, which are all part of a healthy breastfeeding diet, so eat up.Lactation cookiesDid someone mention cookies? Thats rightthere are plenty of recipes for cookies that may help to promote milk supply. The magic ingredients vary, but tend to include things like oatmeal, wheat germ (a source of zinc, which may help heal cracked nipples) and flaxseed (good for omega-3s). Just remember, cookies are still cookies.GarlicIt doesnt just linger on your breathgarlic also changes the flavor of your breast milk. And that could be the reason why women have claimed for centuries that garlic is a milk booster. New research suggests that when baby gets a taste of that unexpected and new flavor, it may cause her to suckle more, which in turn helps boost your supply. Herbal teaCertain herbs are commonly said to help with milk supply, including fenugreek, blessed thistle and fennel seed (you can also eat fennel for a similar effect). Packaged teas designed for nursing mothers are likely to contain these herbs and others. If you want to try one of them, youll get an added bonus: Drinking herbal tea will help you stay hydrated, since getting enough water is also key for milk production. Just keep in mind that most herbs havent been extensively studied, especially when it comes to breastfeeding, so sip with caution and moderation, and check with your doctor if you have concerns.  AdvertisementCarrotsThese beta-carotene powerhouses are rumored to help with milk production, whether you crunch the sticks or drink them juiced. Plus, you could be setting baby up to be a lifelong veggie eater: One study found that when breastfeeding moms ate carrots regularly, their babies were more receptive to the taste later on.WaterJust like during pregnancy, youll want to keep a water bottle within reach and drink up. Two to three liters a day (8 to 12 cups) is helpful for breastfeeding moms to offset the fluid going into the milk you make, Cording says. But chances are you may feel thirsty all the time anyway, so it probably wont be too hard to get your daily requirements.Do I need to take supplements when breastfeeding?A healthy, well-balanced diet is all you really need to cover your nutritional bases when youre breastfeeding, especially if you include meat and fish in your diet. Still, many experts do recommend sticking with your prenatal vitamin while breastfeeding anyway. These are some of the reasons why you might want or even need to supplement your post-pregnancy diet as long as youre feeding baby.For your bonesCalcium, as well as the vitamin D that helps you to absorb it, is a must-have for nursing moms since both pregnancy and nursing temporarily decrease your bone mass (even though extra calcium cant actually prevent the bone loss).For your bloodThe whole no-periods perk of pregnancy and (early) breastfeeding means youre probably at less risk of anemia (low iron) now. But if you lost a lot of blood during or after your delivery, your doctor or midwife might recommend an iron supplement to help replenish that loss.  AdvertisementFor babys brainThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends getting 200 to 300 mg a day of omega-3 fatty acids. If you dont serve up seafood at least once a week, a supplement can help your daily numbers stay on track. Allergic to fish? You can opt for a plant-derived vegetarian supplement. For vegans and vegetariansIf meat, chicken, fish and/or dairy products are off the table, youll need a supplement with vitamin B12 in it. Moms who are vegan may be short on this vitamin, which can lead to low milk supply. Luckily, most over-the-counter multivitamins have it, and its also in fortified foods like breakfast cereal, some nutritional yeasts, meat substitutes and milk substitutes.Do certain foods make baby gassy or colicky?When babys fussy or has colic, its natural to (desperately!) look for a fix. The truth is, every baby is different. If hes otherwise healthy, well fed and gaining weight, some research suggests proteins in your milk (typically from the cows milk you drink) could be the culprit. If youre breastfeeding a gassy or colicky baby, try giving up dairy for a week to 10 days to see if it helps. But if you cant imagine your morning without a bowl of cereal and milk, take note: Cows milk sensitivity is estimated to only happen with about .5 to 1 percent of babies.Other research has taken a bigger picture look at moms menus. Along with cows milk, foods including cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, onion and chocolate were more common in the diets of breastfeeding moms whose babies had belly pain, were irritable and cried a lot. And it makes sense. Many of these trigger foods can lead to gas and bloated bellies in adults, so think what they might do to babys tiny developing GI track.   AdvertisementIn one other study, moms went on a low-allergen (that means no dairy, soy, wheat, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts or fish) breastfeeding diet and it turned out after a week, their colicky babies cried 90 minutes less per day compared with babies of breastfeeding moms who ate their normal dietsincluding peanuts, chocolate, soy and milk every day.How to tell if your breastfeeding baby has an allergyFirst off: If youre worried baby has an allergy, the odds are she probably doesnt. In fact, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, only 2 to 3 percent of exclusively breastfed babies have an allergic reaction. Cows milk protein is usually the culprit, but egg, corn, and soy were other common offenders in one large study. If you (and baby) happen to be the unlucky ones, youre most likely going to see that allergy in the form of a skin rash like eczema or a gastrointestinal symptom like blood in her diapers.One of the simplest ways to figure out if one (or more) of the foods on your breastfeeding diet is bothering baby is to systematically eliminate suspected offenders from your plate. Experts recommend cutting one food at a time, starting with the most likely: cows milk. Then wait at least two weeks (though often youll see a change in as little as a few days) before moving on to another food. Dont see a difference? You can add that food back and try cutting out the next one on your list (like soy, citrus fruits, eggs, nuts, peanuts, wheat, corn, strawberries or chocolate) until youve found the offender.   AdvertisementHow to prevent baby from getting food allergiesYou may be tempted to try and ward off allergies by avoiding foods like milk or nuts, but sorry to say theres little to no evidence that worksand it could even backfire, according to some research. Unless youre dealing with an existing food sensitivity, go nuts: Theres no evidence that restricting your own diet will have any effect on babys chances of eating peanut butter without issue.When it comes time to move beyond milk, the rules are also pretty liberal. Between 4 and 6 months, when you and your doctor decide its time for solids, the skys the limit as far as what single-ingredient foods you can introduce to baby. While its a good idea to start with things like fruits, vegetables and grains, as soon as youre past these less-allergenic menu items, its fine to try adding egg, dairy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish and shellfish. And new research suggests that starting these foods sooner rather than later might even help decrease the risk of allergies. Yes, you read that right. There has been very real and substantial evidence and recommendations about introducing allergenic foods earlier are changing worldwide. The most major original trial was published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, and as of summer 2015, the AAP accepted and endorsed the recommendations. Plus, a whole host of other organizations, including the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, the World Allergy Organization, the Society for Pediatric Dermatology, and the American College of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology, all now support early introduction of allergenic foods.   AdvertisementFeeling overwhelmed? Dont. Yes, breastfeeding nutrition is important, but try not to drive yourself crazy. As long as youre breastfeeding, you feel good, your baby is growing well and everybody is getting along, thats the important thing, Cording says. PHOTO:iStockRelated Video"

Research has shown that the risk for MS appears to be the highest for babies born in May, and lowest for those born in November. And last year a study published in the journal Neurology indicated that higher levels of vitamin D during pregnancy could later prevent MS in mothers.The recent study, however, took blood samples from the umbilical cords of 50 babies born in November (the lowest risk month) and 50 babies born in May (the highest risk month). Researchers studied the vitamin D levels and levels of autoreactive T-cells (white blood cells that help the immune system fight off infections) found in babies blood.For the JAMA study, blood samples were taken from the umbilical cords of 50 babies born in November and 50 babies born in May. Researchers looked at levels of vitamin D and levels of autoreactive T-cells in the babies blood. The researchers noted that babies born in May had significantly lower levels of vitamin D and higher levels of autoreactive T-cells compared to those babies born in November.  AdvertisementCo-author of the study, Dr. Sreeram Ramagopalan, said, ""By showing that month of birth has a measurable impact on in utero immune system development, this study provides a potential biological explanation for the widely observed ""month of birth"" effect in MS. Higher levels of autoreactive T-cells, which have the ability to turn on the body, could explain why babies born in May are at a higher risk of developing MS.""Ramagopalan also went on to reiterate the need for further studies to determine the effect of vitamin D on pregnant women, and how it impacts baby's immune system development. He said, ""The correlation with vitamin D suggests this could be the driver of this effect. There is a need for long-term studies to assess the effect of vitamin D supplementation in pregnant women and the subsequent impact on immune system development and risk of MS and other autoimmune diseases.""Did you have a baby born in May?

10 Pregnancy Foods To Eat For Baby Kristin Koch,https://www.thebump.com/a/10-pregnancy-foods-to-eat-for-baby,"EggsWhat it's got: Whether you like them fried, scrambled, hard-boiled or served as an omelet, eggs are the gold standard for prenatal protein. They also happen to be a great source of folate, iron and choline.Why it's good for both of you: Not only are eggs a relatively cheap, versatile and convenient source of protein, but they contain choline too. Never heard of that last one? Choline is critical to fetal brain development and reduces the risk of neural tube defects, such as spina bifida. But to reap the benefits, you'll have to eat the whole thing (so forget the egg-whites-only order); choline is contained in the yolk. If your cravings are more for a burger than eggs Benedict, youre in luck  there's also choline in beef. Bonus: Give baby a brain boost by buying eggs fortified with omega-3s.Sweet PotatoesWhat it's got: Don't just save these guys for Thanksgiving  sweet potatoes are full of nutritious fiber, vitamin B6, potassium (even more than bananas have!), vitamin C and iron, as well as copper and beta-carotene.Why it's good for both of you: Sure, other foods on our list offer many of the same nutrients, but we're singling out sweet potatoes for their beta-carotene  an antioxidant that your body converts to vitamin A. And as you may recall, vitamin A plays an important role in the development of baby's eyes, bones and skin. Sweet potatoes are also a great way to meet your iron quota. Not only do these orange spuds contain iron, but they also have copper  a mineral that helps your body absorb iron. So swap in sweet potatoes for your usual sides; they're great mashed, baked or French-fried (um, yum!)  AdvertisementNutsWhat they've got: This crunchy (and convenient) snack is full of healthy fats (including those brain-boosting omega-3s we mentioned earlier), protein, fiber and a variety of vitamins and minerals. Plus, noshing on nuts will help make a dent in the 800 milligrams of magnesium you're supposed to get now that you're preggers.Why they're good for both of you: Munching on magnesium-rich foods helps reduce the risk of premature labor and aids in the development of your baby's nervous system. A quarter cup of almonds contains 98 milligrams of magnesium, so keep a stash in your purse for a convenient prenatal power snack on the go. Cravings control: If you feel like a bottomless pit these days, try noshing on shelled pistachios. They take longer to eat, giving your body more time to register that it's full.Beans and LentilsWhat they've got: If you're not a big meat eater (or one at all), beans and lentils are great sources of protein and iron, as well as folate, fiber and calcium. And beans (especially baked ones) are also bursting with zinc.Why they're good for both of you: Beans boast a bunch of the baby- and mom-friendly minerals found in animal products, so they're a great option for vegetarian and vegan moms-to-be. Beans are also rich in zinc  an essential mineral that's linked to a lower risk for preterm delivery, low birth weight and prolonged labor. Beans bother your stomach? Other great sources of zinc include meat, chicken, milk, fortified cereals, cashews, peas, crab and oysters (just don't eat them raw!).  AdvertisementLean MeatWhat it's got: Sure, you know it's a great source of protein, but lean beef and pork are also packed with iron and B vitamins.Why it's good for both of you: Your body needs a lot more protein now (about 25 extra grams a day) to help the fetus grow and to ensure his or her muscles develop properly. Same goes for iron: Not getting enough of this mineral can impair baby's growth and increase the risk for preterm delivery and low birth weight. Iron is important for mom, too  it's necessary for red blood cell formation (to prevent anemia). During pregnancy, your blood volume increases, so you'll need to up your iron intake (to around 27 milligrams a day). Bonus: Meat supplies a hefty dose of vitamins B6 (helps baby's tissue and brain growth, while easing mom's morning sickness) and B12 (helps to maintain healthy nerves and red blood cells).Orange JuiceWhat it's got: Down a glass in the morning to fill up on folate, potassium and, of course, vitamin C.Why it's good for both of you: You've probably heard a lot of buzz about folate and folic acid (the synthetic form that you get in supplements and fortified foods), and with good reason: It's a necessary nutrient for preventing certain birth defects early on in pregnancy and for ensuring a healthy pregnancy after that, so try to get about 600 micrograms a day. The potassium in OJ is important for keeping your muscle function, metabolism and overall health in check. Like iron, pregnant women need to consume more potassium, because of their expanding blood volume. And as you already know, orange juice is an excellent source of vitamin C, which, in addition to fighting colds, helps your body better absorb iron and keeps both your and baby's teeth and bones healthy.  AdvertisementYou can also get your vitamin C from broccoli, tomatoes, strawberries, red peppers and a variety of citrus fruits, including another prenatal power food  mangoes, which are packed with more than 20 different vitamins and minerals. Bonus: Opt for OJ that's fortified with vitamin D, which increases blood circulation in the placenta and aids in calcium absorption so that your baby will have stronger bones.YogurtWhat it's got: Surprise! Plain yogurt actually contains even more calcium than milk. Plus, it's got essential bone-building nutrients, including protein, B vitamins and zinc.Why it's good for both of you: Calcium is essential for keeping your bones and teeth healthy and helping baby to develop his or hers, and skimping on this key nutrient could put you both at risk. Expectant moms should get at least three servings of calcium a day to reduce the risk of low birth weight and preterm delivery. If your calcium count comes up short, your body will take the calcium baby needs from your bones, putting you at greater risk for osteoporosis later on. Bonus: Snack on Greek yogurt topped with fruit for double the protein (and fiber) punch.OatmealWhat it's got: Those oats are filled with fiber, protein and vitamin B6.Why it's good for both of you: Start your morning off right with a nice big bowl of oatmeal. Whole grains are great for keeping your energy levels up, especially if morning sickness has you feeling a bit drained. Plus, all that fiber will help with another pregnancy pleasantry: constipation. But the benefits don't just stop with mom. This convenient breakfast dish (yep, the instant kind is great too!) also contains protein and vitamin B6, both of which are important for baby's development. Bonus: Look for a variety that's fortified with iron, B vitamins and folic acid.  AdvertisementLeafy GreensWhat it's got: You had to know these guys were gonna make the list. Chock-full of antioxidants and nutrients, dark-green veggies  including spinach, asparagus, broccoli and kale  should really be on everyone's plates.Why it's good for both of you: These super foods are especially important for moms-to-be and developing babies. That's because, in addition to all those antioxidants, leafy greens supply calcium, potassium, fiber and folate, plus another important nutrient we haven't told you about yet: vitamin A. Because of its role in helping baby's eyesight develop and aiding in bone and skin growth, it's important for moms to nosh on vitamin A-filled foods too. No midnight cravings for asparagus or spinach? Oranges are also a great source.SalmonWhat it's got: This oily fish is an excellent source of omega-3 fatty acids and protein.Why it's good for both of you: Forget about preordering Baby Einstein DVDs  just incorporate salmon into your diet over the next nine months. The omega-3 fatty acids (aka DHA and EPA) in fish help baby's brain to develop, and higher levels of DHA in newborns have even been associated with higher IQs, advanced motor skills and fewer neurological problems later on. Omega-3s are good for the development of baby's eyes, too, and salmon is also a great source of lean protein for moms-to-be. Worried about seafood? Salmon's low in mercury and considered safe for expectant moms, but limit your intake to two servings of six ounces or less each week to be safe. Just not feeling fish right now? Snack on walnuts and almonds.

Why Folic Acid Is Important For Pregnancy Paula Kashtan,https://www.thebump.com/a/getting-folic-acid-during-pregnancy,"When taken before you conceive and throughout your pregnancy, folic acid (also known as vitamin B9) has been shown to drastically decrease the risk of neural tube defects like spina bifida and anencephaly. In fact, doctors and the CDC think so highly of this vitamin that they recommend every woman of child-bearing age (even if you're not currently in baby-making mode) takes 400 micrograms of folic acid every day, just in case. Since baby's neural tube closes around days 49 to 56and that's often the time women first realize they're pregnantyou'll be covered if you've already been taking folic acid on a daily basis. Once you get pregnant, the suggested daily intake jumps to 600 to 800 micrograms. If you have a family history of neural tube defects, you should get even more (usually about 10 times as much), so let your doctor know and she can help determine the correct amount you'll need. Find this wonder-acid in whole grains, leafy greens, citrus fruits and some legumes. Since the US government has hopped on the folic acid bandwagon, the vitamin is now added to nearly all breads, cereal, pasta, rice and flour. (Finally, a good reason to eat carbs!) But even if you're eating many of these folic-acid-rich foods you can (and should) up your folic acid intake even more with a supplement. Most women dont get nearly enough of this vitamin, and since its water-soluble, youll just pee out whatever you dont need. Related Video"
8 Ways to Boost Male Fertility,https://www.thebump.com/a/8-ways-to-boost-male-fertility,"Have you been trying to conceive, but still no luck? Turns out, about a third of infertility cases are the result of less-than-stellar sperm quality. Dont get discouraged just yet though! These simple lifestyle changes can make a huge difference in turning a mans sperm into champion swimmers.1. Pop a few vitaminsWhile theres no equivalent of a prenatal vitamin for guys, he should make a habit of taking a daily multi. A recent New Zealand study showed that men taking oral supplements with antioxidants helped boost their partners odds of getting pregnant. Folic acid (1 mg/day), vitamin C (500 mg/day), vitamin D (1000 IU/day) and vitamin E (400 IU/day) are especially great since they can reduce free radical production and aid in sperm-cell membrane stability and function. 2. Start cross-trainingNot only is hitting the gym a few times a week great for overall health, it can also improve his sperm count. According to a Harvard School of Public Health study, men who participated in moderate-to-vigorous activity at least 15 hours a week had 73 percent higher sperm concentration than men who moved less than five hours a week. Plus, couch potatoes who watched more than 20 hours of TV per week had 44 percent lower sperm concentration than men who didnt watch anything at all. While any exercise that breaks a sweat is great, adding resistance training is even better. Lifting weights can increase testosterone levels and, big bonus here, aid in higher sperm concentration. 3. Do a 90-day detoxBet you didnt know it takes somewhere between 75 and 90 days for sperm to form and mature before shooting out into the world. That means your guy needs to start taking care of his body at least three months before he starts thinking about making babies. Have him look at his lifestyle habits, says reproductive endocrinologist Carmelo Sgarlata, MD. You want him to be free of anything that could hinder sperm production. The goal is to have a healthy environment from the start. Translation: If he only cuts back on drinking, smoking or junk food when youre ovulating it wont make much difference, but having him embrace an anti-inflammatory diet and an exercise routine on a daily basis leading up to when you plan to get pregnant will.  Advertisement4. Go nutsseriouslyIt turns out consuming healthy nuts leads to, well, healthy nuts! UCLA researchers studied more than 100 men to investigate the effect of eating walnuts. Three months later, the mens semen quality was analyzed and showed that those who consumed 2.5 ounces each day had significantly increased levels of omega-3 fatty acids. That translated into better sperm vitality, mobility and fewer chromosomal abnormalities. Eating any type of nut could reduce oxidative stress in your body, adds Sgarlata. And, in turn, potentially improve sperm production. 5. Be picky with your plasticsMake a point to cut down the use of products containing BPA or phthalates. Its been well proven that these chemicals are hormone disruptors and can negatively impact a guys sperm quality. In fact, a study even showed that men with high BPA exposure had lower sperm motility. And those men who had a higher concentration of phthalate traces in their urine took longer to impregnate their partners. While it can be next to impossible to avoid plastic entirely these days, definitely nix the most toxic numbers (plastics 3, 6 and 7) completely from your life. For a smart breakdown check out this helpful guide. 6. Green your sunscreenSince skin is ultra-absorbent, it matters what you put on it. And last year a study showed that high exposure to two UV filter chemicals often found in sunscreen actually diminished reproductive ability in men (but not women) by 30 percent. Keep in mind, this doesnt give him the red light to shun sunscreen altogether. Instead, opt for natural formulas that rely on minerals like zinc and titanium instead of the lab-made oxybenzone. Two to try: JASON Natural Mineral Sunscreen or Solbar Zinc Sun Protection Cream  Advertisement7. Make like a MediterraneanMaintaining a healthy weight ups his chances to fertilize your egg. And while there are many ways to go about dropping pounds, his best bet is to follow the Mediterranean diet, which emphasizes plant-based foods including whole grains, greens and nuts as well as fish and poultry. Consume five to six servings of fruits and veggies every day, adds Sgarlata. Make sure you eat across the color spectrumfrom eggplants to strawberriesto get the most antioxidants. Just check that the produce is low in pesticide residue, which can negatively affect sperm quality. Hell also want to cut back on processed meats, like bacon. One study showed that men who ate one to three servings per day had worse sperm quality. On the other hand, those who ate fish, especially fatty fish such as salmon, had 34 percent higher sperm count.8. Beware of mobile hot spotsDoes he carry his phone all day long in his pocket? Work in bed at night with his laptop propped on his lap? The electromagnetic energy (think: Wi-Fi signal) could potentially damage a guys tadpoles in some very scary ways, including creating abnormal shapes and altering DNA in sperm. At least 10 human studies have confirmed such findings, so do yourself a favor and ask him to relocate that smartphone and keep that tablet off his lap.

Morning Sickness,https://www.thebump.com/a/morning-sickness,"What is morning sickness?Before your pregnancy, you probably imagined that when you woke up in the morning, youd be nauseous, throw up and then go on with your day. Well...not so much. Whoever decided to call it morning sickness was probably sleeping through the day, because this nausea doesnt discriminate between the morning, afternoon or evening.What are the signs of morning sickness?Nauseaand vomiting  of course  early in pregnancy.Are there any tests for morning sickness?If youre losing significant weight or cant keep anything down, those may be signs of a more serious problem, so talk to your doctor.How common is morning sickness?Common! Experts think anywhere from 50 to 90 percent of pregnant women get morning sickness.How did I get morning sickness?Theres no clear answer as to why nausea occurs during pregnancy, although its believed that its due to hormonal changes (that seems to be the answer to everything these days). Generally, the nausea isnt too overwhelming, and by midpregnancy, you should be mostly relieved of it. But if your nausea and vomiting are excessive, talk to your doctor, because it may be hyperemesis gravidarum, a rare severe form of morning sickness that results in a poor intake of fluids and food (and a hungry baby).How will my morning sickness affect baby?Morning sickness can be dangerous for both you and baby if youre losing more than 10 percent of your baseline weight or if youre unable to keep down even sips of water.

(Theyre available at most drugstores).Vitamin B6 has been shown in scientific studies to reduce early pregnancy nausea. Taking a 10 milligram or 25 milligram tablet up to four times a day can help soothe your tummy. A 250 milligram ginger capsule taken up to four times daily has also been shown in scientific studies to reduce nausea and vomiting associated with pregnancy.Finally, if youre spending a good part of the day over the toilet or simply cant stomach the thought of waiting until your second trimester to feel better, ask your doctor about over-the-counter or prescription medications that might help.What can I do to prevent morning sickness?Although you cant really prevent morning sickness, studies show that women who take multivitamins before conception are less likely to get nauseous  so if youre TTC, start sucking those vitamins down now.

"Can Baby Be A Vegetarian? Jennifer Mellick, MD Pediatrician",https://www.thebump.com/a/baby-vegetarian,"There are three main types of vegetarians (and a few sub-types)  all of them eat no meat.Lacto-ovo vegetarians: They dont eat animal flesh but do eat eggs and dairy products.Lacto vegetarians: They eat dairy products but no other animal products.Vegans:They eat no animal products  including honey and gelatin. Find out if a vegan diet is safe for baby here All vegetarians should plan their diets carefully so that theyre not deficient in certain vitamins and minerals such as vitamin B12, calcium, vitamin D and iron.Its relatively easy for baby to be vegetarian when he starts eating solid foods, usually between four and six months old. Some signs that can help you know that babys ready to eat solids are: shes sitting up, she opens her mouth for a spoon and closes her lips over a spoon, shes able to let you know if shes full or hungry, she keeps her tongue low and flat when you put the spoon in her mouth, and shes showing an interest in food while others around her are eating. All vegetables and fruits can be pureed and given to a vegetarian. A vegetarian baby can get protein-rich foods from pureed tofu, cottage cheese, cheese, yogurt and egg products, and strained legumes (like beans, peas, chickpeas and lentils). He should get a variety of fruits and veggies  and stay away from unhealthy foods that could be considered vegetarian, like potato chips that are fried in canola oil, or soda. Feed baby iron-fortified cereal to prevent iron-deficiency anemia.  AdvertisementThe bottom line  a baby on breast milk or formula can get a good balance of nutrients on a vegetarian diet. Ensure baby is growing at a healthy rate with regular checkups with her pediatrician. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends screening all babies for iron deficiency between 6 and 12 months  whether theyre vegetarian or not. It is also recommended that all breastfed babies and formula-fed babies who receive less than 32 ounces of formula daily, receive a vitamin D supplement.When baby grows to toddler age, its important to monitor her nutrient intake because toddlers tend to be picky eaters. Recently, the AAP began recommending a 30-month well-child visit to keep tabs on picky eaters health. Most toddlers, especially vegetarians and vegans should be on a multivitamin that contains iron.Plus, more from The Bump:Can baby be vegan?Safe solids for babyBest foods for baby?Related Video"
How Much Milk Should My One-Year-Old Drink?,http://www.thebump.com/a/how-much-milk-should-one-year-old-child-drink,"Not as much as you may think. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends two to three 8 oz. cups of milk per day, per toddler.Milk can be a nutritious beverage, and young, growing kids benefit from milks protein, calcium and vitamin D. The problem is that milk also contains calories, and, in some cases, fat  and some kids drink so much milk that they fail to eat other foods and nutrients. Kids can overdo it with milk and get anemic, says Michael Lee, MD, a pediatrician at Childrens Medical Center in Dallas. In our population, we have a lot of kids with iron deficiency, and a lot of them are power milk drinkers.So keep a close eye on the milk carton. Try serving water with meals and offering milk with snacks, or vice versa. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends toddlers between the ages of one and two drink breast milk, whole milk or 2 percent milk. (2 percent milk is recommended for toddlers who are at risk of becoming overweight.) After age two, transition your child to skim or 1 percent milk, which offers similar nutrition in fewer calories.Plus, more from The Bump:How Can I Get My Toddler to Drink More Water?

Leg Cramps During Pregnancy - TheBump.com,https://www.thebump.com/a/leg-cramps-during-pregnancy,"What are leg cramps during pregnancy?Youch! Leg cramps happen when your muscles suddenly tighten  and they hurt!What are the signs of leg cramps?Pain or a jumpy sensation in your legs.Are there any tests for leg cramps during pregnancy?No, but they could be a sign of another condition  especially if you get them often, theyre severe or if you also have redness, swelling, warmth or tenderness in your leg  so your doc might test you for other things.How common are leg cramps during pregnancy?You're not alone  leg cramps (otherwise known as charley horses) are actually quite common during pregnancy. Leg cramps tend to be even more common (and painful!) in the third trimester, because your legs have all that extra weight to carry around late in pregnancy.How did I get leg cramps?Leg cramps may signal one of two things: a lack of nutrients or dehydration. When your body doesn't have enough water or sodium, your muscles can contract; this is what you feel as a cramp.How will my leg cramps affect my baby?They shouldnt, but if youre not getting enough fluids or nutrients, that could negatively affect baby. Dehydration in particular can cause contractions, which can lead to preterm labor.Whats the best way to treat leg cramps during pregnancy?Taking acetaminophen might help ease the pain temporarily, but your best bet is to prevent them from happening in the first place.What can I do to prevent leg cramps during pregnancy?  AdvertisementTo prevent cramps caused by dehydration, be sure you're drinking between 8 and 12 glasses of water a day. If water's not quite your thing, you can include milk, juice (avoid juice packed with sugar), sparkling water and decaf tea and coffee in the mix too.The other problem may be your diet. Drops in potassium, calcium or magnesium can all lead to muscle spasms. Now that you're pregnant, you should have 4,700 mg of potassium, 1,000 to 1,300 mg of calcium and 350 to 360 mg of magnesium per day.In addition to eating and drinking right, there are some things you can do to limit those sharp pains in your calves. Stretching will keep your muscles more elastic and less likely to contract. Walking around and getting that blood flowing might help too.What do other pregnant moms do when they have leg cramps?The leg cramps have been the worst part of my second trimester so far! Almost every night, they wake me up, and Ive definitely had a few knots, usually in my thighs. I started drinking more water and milk, and theyve gotten a lot better. I stretch every night and morning now too.I used to get leg cramps once in a while pre-pregnancy, but now Im in my early third trimester and just a few weeks ago started getting them once or twice a week. Sometimes its so bad it feels like the tightest knot ever and lasts a few days. I read that increasing calcium in your diet helps.

Natural Remedies To Help You Sleep Better,https://www.thebump.com/a/natural-sleep-aids,"Between fluctuating hormones and at least one nightly trip to the bathroom, its hard to log a good eight hours or so of sleep  especially late in pregnancy. So what are some good drug-free ways to help ensure quality pillow time? Start by shoring up what sleep experts call your sleep hygiene. Begin by establishing good habits, getting yourself to bed at a reasonable hour (ideally before 11 p.m.) as often as possible. Keep the lights dim in your room (turn off lamps, clocks and other electronics), because light can also interfere with your sleep cycle. Avoid getting on the computer or watching the news before bed, since youll want to enter dreamland thinking of pleasant things, not stressful ones. And finally, make sure youre getting enough natural light during the day (at least 20 minutes) to help regulate melatonin levels; the hormone can influence your sleep/wake cycles.Still not snoozing? Start with a cup of herbal tea an hour or so before bed (favorites for inducing sleep include chamomile, catnip and oatstraw). You can find these herbs already made into teas at many health-food stores. Try having it with a light, high-protein snack like a slice of turkey or a handful of nuts, which takes a while to digest and can help keep glycemic levels steady (so you dont wake up starving at 5 a.m.). Magnesium supplements may also be helpful, since the mineral is known to alleviate muscle pain (something that may be interfering with your sleep as you cope with your ever-growing tummy). Just ask your doctor about the right dosage for you, since too much magnesium can cause diarrhea. You can also consider the amino acid L-theanine, which is known for helping to safely moderate nighttime cortisol levels. Finally, check with your doctor if you are considering taking a melatonin supplement  its highly touted for its role in regulating sleep cycles, but there are conflicting opinions (and not a lot of good clinical evidence) about how safe it is when youre sleeping for two.

Weird Pregnancy Cravings,https://www.thebump.com/a/weird-pregnancy-cravings,"Pickles and ice cream? Sauerkraut with a side of Easy Mac? Pregnancy cravings may seem clich, but there's no doubt that they happen. (Note from the author: For me, it's all about string cheese and strawberries. That's rightat six months pregnant, I crave the diet of a two-year-old.) To find out what other weirdness is being craved these days and why, we chatted with a few experts and a bunch of real-life pregnant ladies.What do we crave?Everyone's different, of course, but according to a study from The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the top contenders were sweets (like fruit, candy or chocolate) and dairy (like ice cream and milk). Lots of moms-to-be had an urge for fish, meat or poultry too. Check out a few of our faves from the message boards:Rice with brown sugar, barbecue sauce, and butter. I thought it was soooo good and my husband looked at me like I was crazy. Now I would get sick if I ate that  gross! ahartzleBrownies with mustard or mac and cheese mixed with lo mein. Scooter 359McDonalds sweet tea, garlic-stuffed olives, and salt  my husband walked in on me drinking the pickle juice straight from the jar. t.bird Jarred spaghetti sauce laced with about four tablespoons of sugar. I think it's got something to do with the sugar cutting the acid in the tomatoes, but it's been delectable to me on my pasta! Flowr4246 Sometimes, I put pickles on Oreo cookies. You know those little round pickles for sandwiches? They're the perfect size for an Oreo. blissfully_caffeinatedI had a craving for chalky things like TUMS and chewable vitamins. scubaspot Onions and mustard. I don't even like onions, but I would crave chopped onion drenched in mustard. Morrison4319I've been dipping cheese in ketchup! So gross but so good. aerobabySalt! I have been eating it by the spoonful. I even went as far as having the hubby hide everything from garlic salt to table salt. kasslynne  AdvertisementI have craved sour items throughout my pregnancy. For a few days, all I would eat was sour cream right out of the container. It was the only thing that appealed to me. mbear511Goldfish crackers dipped in strawberry ice cream. My husband had to hide the crackers because it was grossing him out! Celtic EmberPickles in cream cheese wrapped with pepperoni. katieriedelWhy are we craving?Why ice cream? Why pickles? Well, no one is 100 percent sure, but it turns out your overwhelming urge for Swiss steak might not be so weird after all. Pregnancy cravings are basically evolutionary, suggests Dr. Brian Wansink, author of Mindless Eating: Why We Eat More Than We Think. The reason for a bizarre craving for anchovies or charcoal is because there's something deficient in a woman's system that she needs. Craving sweet potato fries? Maybe it's your body's cry for potassium or vitamin A. But why do you NEED it to be sweet potato fries? People tend to crave something that has the highest amount of that stuff [they're lacking]...with something that they can tolerate eating. In other words, your body's sending signals of what it needs, and your brain/taste buds might spin that into something that you naturally find yummy. And if you're getting a totally balanced diet? According to Dr. Wansink, you probably aren't craving much.Can this explain your need for chocolate milkshakes? Surethat's a big helping of calcium. But the midnight run for Fritos is a little tougher to chalk up to nutrients. Julia Hormes, a doctoral candidate at the University of Pennsylvania, studies premenstrual cravings and thinks her findings apply to some pregnancy cravings as well. Her explanation: Some cravings are (dare we say it?) big fat excuses. For example, you want Twinkies because, well, you WANT Twinkies. When you wanted Twinkies before, you might have grabbed a banana and ignored the unhealthy desire for goo and sugar, or even totally denied the fact that you desired them. But now you're pregnant. Your body's going through a lot and  darn it  you're going to have a Twinkie if you want one. I think pregnancy may well be a situation where our culture acknowledges a woman's right to indulge herself. Our culture sort of gives you permission. Women give themselves permission, she explains. A few Bumpies agree that cravings can go both ways (nutritional and absolutely not):   AdvertisementI haven't craved anything weird. I've mostly allowed myself to indulge in things that I normally don't allow myself to eat and write it off as a craving. browneyes_24b[I craved] Hardy's Thickburgers and cheeseburgers in general. I think it was my body's way of demanding that I feed it more iron. Oh yes, and any form of cake. I think that was my body's way of telling me that cake is delicious. 7miles(Note: If you start craving nonfood stuff like dirt, charcoal, clay or laundry starch, don't eat it! This is a disorder called pica, which some scientists think may be related to iron deficiency or other dietary needs. Resist the urge and call your doctor ASAPthey should be able to help you stick to eating real food.)PHOTO:VeerRelated Video"
Fatigue While Pregnant With Multiples? Excerpted from The Baby ...,https://www.thebump.com/a/fatigue-while-pregnant-with-multiples,"Unfortunately, this is likely a case of bigger not always being better, at least when it comes to the side effects of pregnancy. If youre carrying twins, everything seems to be double  double the hormones, double the stress, double your hunger. And if youre carrying triplets, well, lets just say we completely understand the need for a midday (and morning, and early-evening) nap. Its not just the hormones: Because your body is facing greater demands than even a one-baby pregnancy, youre much more likely to suffer from anemia (iron deficiency), which can make you feel like youve been hit by an 18-wheeler. As tough as it may be in the early stages to stomach the idea of eating anything, let alone eating more of something, try to make sure youre getting enough of those key vitamins and minerals, like iron and calcium. And take your prenatal vitamins  theyre like a big old safety net to make sure youre getting at least the minimum amount of the necessary nutrients.

How Much Your Pregnancy Will Really Cost You Kelly Alfieri,https://www.thebump.com/a/how-much-pregnancy-costs,"We wish we could give you a firm number, butprenatal health care and delivery costs vary radically. How much youll pay will depend on factors like where you live, whether you have any complications and whether you have a vaginal birth or a c-section. But here are some ballpark figures: Prenatal care and delivery costs can range from about $9,000 to over $250,000 (quite a range, huh?). But before you freak out, know that were talking without insurance. With health insurance, the bulk of these expenses could be covered  but thats not always true.I have health insurance. What should I expect to pay for prenatal care and delivery?Policies that cover maternity costsGood news: If you have insurance provided by your employer and the company employs at least 15 people full-time, your insurance must provide maternity services.The percentage of prenatal and maternity costs that will be covered depends on your insurance carrier and which plan you have, but typically, employee plans cover between 25 percent and 90 percent of costs. Keep in mind that this is after the deductible has been met and that there may be a separate deductible for each family member, so youll likely be paying a bit more than that out of pocket. In other words, if each family member (including your newborn baby) has a $2,000 deductible, youd have to pay the first $4,000 of expenses for both your and babys medical care, plus whatever else your plan doesnt pay for.If you have a plan through the Affordable Care Act, it will cover pregnancy and childbirth  yes, even if you were pregnant before you got the coverage.  AdvertisementPolicies that don'tIf you have an individual insurance policy, which isnt provided through your employer, odds are it wont cover maternity costs. Several states mandate that plans cover prenatal and delivery costs, but most states dont require that they do. In 2010, just 12 percent of individual policies offered maternity coverage. Often, its possible to buy a rider to cover maternity expenses, but the cost for that can be high (up to $1,100 a month), and sometimes theres a waiting period of one or two years before the benefit can be used.How can I make sure my health insurance provider pays for as much as possible?To avoid paying extra or for something you shouldnt have to, its important that you thoroughly understand your insurance carriers maternity coverage policy. If you have insurance through your employer, your human resources department should be able to help you understand your coverage. Most carriers also have a pregnancy hotline you can call to find out all the details. Follow these tips to ensure maximum coverage and minimum sticker shock:Go in-network.Choose an OB and hospital or birthing center thats in-network to avoid out-of-pocket costs.Understand your insurance plan.Find out the deductible, copay and out-of-pocket maximums to estimate what your costs will be.Don't stay too long at the hospital.Check the length of hospital stay that is covered and only stay that long, if possible.Notify your carrier of baby's birth asap.Many plans require that a new baby be added to a familys insurance policy within 30 days of birth. If not, your babys expenses may not be covered. Some even expect you to call them when you get to the hospital to deliver, and if you dont, they may refuse to cover the cost of your delivery and your babys hospital care.  AdvertisementHow can I get health insurance if my (or my partners) employer doesnt provide it?Individual health insurance may be an option, but look closely at your choices, since the plans usually dont cover maternity costs and sometimes legally treat pregnancy as a preexisting condition (which means it might not be well-covered). You may qualify for a federal or state health insurance program. A few that are available:MedicaidThis federally funded program provides medical assistance to low-income families and individuals. Kathleen Stoll, deputy executive director of Families USA, recommends that women explore this option even if they dont think that theyll qualify. Income eligibility levels are higher for pregnant women, so dont assume that youre not eligible, she says.State health insurance programsThese are offered in several states. Qualifications vary from state to state.Healthcare.govIt facilitates federally funded health centers that provide basic medical care, including prenatal care on a sliding scale fee basis. And, as we mentioned above, it covers pregnancy costs.COBRAThis program offers continuation of health coverage to individuals and families who lose their health benefits because of job loss or other qualifying circumstances.For help finding out more about private insurance options, check out the Plan Finder.What are some ways to reduce my prenatal and delivery costs?Shop around.Unlike in an emergency medical situation, you can be a smart shopper. You can do some shopping ahead of time because you have lead time, says Stoll. Look for a hospital that offers good rates for delivery and postnatal care (yes, you can ask), and see if it's considered in-network for your plan.Consider other settings.If you anticipate an uncomplicated birth, consider using a birthing center instead of a hospital. The costs will range from about $3,000 to $4,000, which is about half of what a hospital birth would cost. Just know that the birthing center may not be considered in-network, so you could end up paying more out of pocket than you would at an in-network hospital. For a home birth, usually all costs are 100 percent out of pocket, but they're usually much less costly.  AdvertisementNegotiate with your hospital.Find out if the financing department of the hospital where youll deliver offers discounts for uninsured patients or if it will work with you to set up a payment plan.Take generic medications.Work with your OB to explore if there are generic alternatives to drugs prescribed during prenatal or postnatal care. You may also be able to take over-the-counter prenatal vitamins instead of prescription ones, says Stoll.Plus, more from The Bump:How Much Having a Baby Is Going to Cost51 Ways to Save Up for BabyTop 5 Things Moms-to-Be Hate About Going to the OBBest Things Moms Brought to the HospitalRelated Video"
Q&A: Safe Natural Supplements To Take During Pregnancy?

Best Foods For Baby (and What To Avoid) Erika Rasmusson Janes,https://www.thebump.com/a/best-foods-for-baby,"When it comes to feeding baby, theres no ""Top 10"" list of super foods for moms to print out, stick on the fridge and stick to. (Sorry!) But experts agree that limiting your little one to a few best foods in her first year (or any year, for that matter) would actually do her a disservice. ""The first year of life is when the palate is trained,"" says Tina Ruggiero, MS, RD, LD, coauthor of The Best Homemade Baby Food on the Planet. ""The three rules I tell my clients to follow are: Go for color, think fresh and introduce new flavors and different textures at age-appropriate stages. Following these guidelines, parents will find more than 10 fruits, more than 10 vegetables and more than 10 proteins to try."" And while you'll also want to talk with baby's pediatrician for guidance, adding the following great options to babys dietand avoiding a few first-year no-no foodswill get him or her off to a healthy start.Breast MilkWeve all heard (and heard, and heard) that breast is best. But just because baby is ready to move beyond the boob doesnt mean you should stop nursing. After all, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends exclusive breastfeeding for about six months. But the organization also recommends that breastfeeding continue along with solid fooods until baby is 12 months oldor longer, if it works for both mom and baby. The very best food for the first year is breast milk, says Loraine Stern, MD, FAAP, coauthor of the book Nutrition: What Every Parent Needs to Know.Best Age for Breast Milk: Birth and older  AdvertisementIron-Fortified CerealBaby is born with a natural supply of iron, but itll be depleted by the time shes around 6 months old, Stern says, so introducing iron-rich foods is essential. One that fits the bill: iron-fortified cereal. It doesnt have to be the traditional first food of rice cerealoatmeal and barley are good options toojust make sure you start with a single-grain formula.Best Age for Iron-Fortified Cereal: Four to six monthsAvocadosAvocados are a great first fruit to offer baby, because theyre loaded with monounsaturated fats (thats the good kind!) and have a mild taste and smooth consistency. Theyre super-easy to prepare too: Simply mash a very ripe avocado with a little breast milk or formula until it reaches a pureed consistency.Best Age for Avocados: Six months and olderSweet PotatoesOkay, so theres no baby super foodbut sweet potatoes come pretty close. According to The Best Homemade Baby Food on the Planet, theyre one of the most nutritious foods for baby. Why? Theyre rich in beta-carotene, which the body converts to vitamin Aand thats important for good vision, healthy skin, normal growth and protection from infections. Plus, many babies like the soft, pudding-like texture of pureed sweet potatoes, says Susan Casey, RD, CD, pediatric clinical dietitian at Seattle Children's Hospital.Best Age for Sweet Potatoes: Six months and olderMeatMeatlike chicken, lamb or beefis an excellent source of protein, as well as iron, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin B6 and zinc. Just make sure its pureed to a smooth texture. (According to Nutrition, for infants, even finely chopped meat may be hard to handle and cause choking.) Try mixing the pureed meat with breast milk and a favorite veggie puree if youre preparing it yourself, or buy plain pureed jarred meats.Best Age for Meat: 7 to 10 months and older  AdvertisementBeetsBeets are an extraordinary nutrient source, says Ruggiero. Theyre a good source of folic acid, high in potassium and beta-carotene, and theyre a sweet veggiewhich babies take a liking to quickly. Roast or steam them until theyre super-soft; then mash them.Best Age for Beets: 11 months and olderYogurtPlain (not vanilla) whole-milk yogurt is another protein-rich option for babyplus, it contains calcium and beneficial live active cultures. (Confused as to why yogurt made with cows milk is okay for babies, but actual cows milk isnt? Very simply, lactose is already broken down with the culturing of the yogurt, and milk proteins are either removed or limited, so its easy for baby to digest, says Ruggiero.)Best Age for Yogurt: Nine months and olderCheeriosBelieve it or not, many experts love good old-fashioned Cheerios. The little Os in the yellow box are an excellent finger food and a good source of fiber. I dont think childhood would exist without Cheerios, says Stern.Best Age for Cheerios: Nine months and olderA FEW FIRST YEAR NO-NOSHoneyTempted to sweeten up babys bland pear sauce with a touch of honey? Dont. According to Nutrition, Honey is linked to infant botulism, an illness that can be fatal. The tummies of babies under age one simply cant deactivate the botulism spores that might be in honey, Stern says. So avoid this food until baby has passed his or her first birthday.Nuts and PeanutsYou can introduce small amounts of creamynot chunkypeanut butter when your child is one year old (try spreading a thin layer on a cracker), but avoid nuts in whole form until he or she is 4 years old to prevent choking.  AdvertisementCows MilkBabies just cant easily digest cows milk, which is one reason why experts recommend waiting until the one-year mark before offering it.Plus, more from The Bump:Baby Food Taste Test: What the Littlest Critics LikedBaby Food Recipes for Every StageWhen to Start Solid FoodsPHOTO:ShutterstockRelated Video"
These Fertility-Boosting Foods are In Season This Month,https://www.thebump.com/a/fertility-boosting-foods-perfect-for-may,"Getting your daily dose of vitamins and minerals is essential to any healthy diet  especially when youre trying to conceive. Youre probably already eating plenty of fruits, veggies, whole grains and lean proteins which are available throughout the year, but focusing your diet around seasonally-fresh ingredients has even better benefits. Not only is it good for the environment to buy locally (this generally means lower prices too), but when you buy in-season produce, it tastes fresher and is packed with more nutrients.You may think of summer as the ripe time for many fruits and vegetables, but according to James Parker, the associate coordinator for Whole Foods Markets global perishables buying office, thats not the case.In the produce business, we all kind of wish every month was like May. Its a time of intense change, and it marks the official start of the summer tree fruit season, Parker told Time. We also see a tremendous increase in local and regional production throughout the US. Because its domestic season, the product doesnt have to travel as far.May is generally the best time to add these fertility-boosting foods to your shopping cart:Avocados A great way to get your daily dose of folate is through avocados. Folate protects against birth defects in the brain and spine that can develop in the first few weeks of pregnancy. The green, skinned fruit contains vitamin K, which helps your body effectively absorb nutrients while maintaining hormonal balance. Its also high in potassium, a key to regulating blood pressure.  AdvertisementOkay, avocados arent exactly low-cal, but theyre mostly made up of monounsaturated fats (thats the good kind), so one a day is fine. Typically its best to buy organic fruits and vegetables, but you can save a few bucks here since the thick skin makes it hard for pesticides to seep in, says holistic fertility nutritionist Kim Ross.A great way to eat it: Spread one-third of an avocado on multigrain toast and drizzle with olive oil, another known fertility booster. It contains a high concentration of vitamin E, which is known to stabilize and protect cells from oxidative damage, a plus for women with PCOS or diabetes.Berries Blueberries and raspberries are loaded with natural antioxidants and anti-inflammatory phytonutrients, which help boost both female and male fertility. Like citrus, theyre high in folate and vitamin C, which can help with fetal development down the road. Berries are also a good source of fiber and can aid in weight loss (women at a healthier weight tend to have less trouble conceiving), so aim for at least one cup a day.Spinach Eating dark green veggies (like kale and Swiss chard too) is one of the best ways to take in essential prenatal nutrients like calcium, iron (especially important when youre menstruating) and folate, which also protects against birth defects in the brain and spine that can develop in the first few weeks of pregnancy. Since it can take a few weeks to even know youre pregnant, its important to load up on plenty of folate while youre TTC. Most women dont get enough from their diet though, so the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends taking a daily vitamin with folic acid (the synthetic version of folate) to reach the suggested 400 mcg dose.  AdvertisementCitrus Fruits Not only are oranges, grapefruits and other citrus fruits one of the best sources for vitamin C, theyre also packed with potassium, calcium and folate  a B vitamin that can help you get pregnant by regulating ovulation and creating a healthy environment for eggs. You should aim for at least one serving of citrus fruit each day (try a medium-size grapefruit, a large orange, three clementines or one kiwi) in addition to another serving of fruits.For more fertility-boosting foods, visit TheBump.com .PHOTO:ShutterstockRelated Video"
Daphne Oz Dishes on Her Healthy Pregnancy (and Helping Other ...,http://www.thebump.com/a/daphne-oz-interview,"The Bump: Congratulations on your pregnancy! Can you tell us a little bit about White Ribbon Alliance and Star Showers, the causes youve partnered up with to help moms-to-be in need?Daphne Oz: Sure! White Ribbon Alliance's Star Showers works to bring everybody  from individual men and women, local organizations and also local and government authorities  together to create a really powerful voice that demands improvement to care before, during and after birth. Launched by a group of women-led organizations, White Ribbon Alliance, The MOMS, Kangu.org and Weinstein Carnegie Philanthropic Group, the goal here really is to make sure that every mother everywhere has an opportunity for a safe, healthy and happy birth. Here in America, its not even necessarily a given that you can have a healthy safe birth. I have been very fortunate to have great maternal care and I feel like so many people that I know have been able to experience the best of what maternal care can be and its our responsibility to be able to ensure that right for mothers across the world.TB: Wow, so amazing! Have any issues taken on a different meaning to you since you found out you were expecting?DO: Hugely so. I didnt realize how dangerous it was even in America to give birth. You watch the gift of life or whatever that movie is you see in sixth grade health class, so thats your exposure to what birthing is like. As an expectant mom, Ive made it my job to research every option out there for me, whether its birthing at home, water birthing, Hypnobirthing, birthing with midwife and birthing with anOB  and we are so fortunate to have access to that information to be able to choose what really makes sense for us and for our lifestyles.  AdvertisementBut certainly as a woman, Ive been aware of the problems that face women all over the world when it comes to giving birth and making sure that they are given sanitary and conscious conditions in which to do it. When youre on that journey yourself, you just become so much more in tune to how unifying this experience is. Its such a uniquely female and such a special time in a womans life if youre given the gift to be able to have a child and give birth. Its something thats so bonding in that way and as a mother, you cant help but want to know that all other mothers have the same, at the very least, healthy and safe experience you did.TB: Youre also a healthy living expert, so what are your top tips for other moms-to-be?DO: I am! And Im one of those nerds who just feels better if I read all the information; so when I first found out I was pregnant, I didnt plan to drink and I was planning to go off of caffeine and all that stuff, but then one of the first articles that I read was actually about caffeine, which was a much harder give up for me than my weekly glass of wine because we have to be at the studio at 6 AM! The article was written by a female economist who was also expecting (and an avid coffee drinker). She went through all the research that doctors were using to recommend that US women not drink a ton of caffeine while pregnant and she found that the data really showed that as long as youre drinking significantlyless than you were before yougot pregnant and as long as you don't have any increased risk of miscarriage or complications with your pregnancy,youre fine. It got me thinking: I cant imagine every French woman giving up her glass of red wine at dinner; every Japanese woman giving up her green tea.  AdvertisementAfter we told our parents that we were expecting, one of the first things my dad said to me was, You can read everything you want  but you definitely want to talk to your doctor. Listen to what your OB-GYN says. I took that advice to heart. Im very fortunate that I have a ton of doctors in my immediate family, as well as alternative medical practitioners and homeopathic experts. So I talked to all of them to see what made sense for me, which is advice Id recommend to every expectant woman. At the end of the day, the most dangerous thing for your baby is for you to be stressed out. So dont spend a lot of time or energy on stress, being anxious and worrying that youre not doing it right. In the end, there is no one right answer  your cravings are going to be different, your baby is going to be different, your body and your needs are going to be different. So, just really paying attention to what makes you feel good  thats the most important tip I could give.TB: Thats really wise advice! Have you made any changes to your routine?DO: Well, Ive always been pretty good about taking my vitamins and eating well, but I definitely got on the prenatal bandwagon right away. The most important addition to taking my prenatals was also taking a probiotic. You definitely want your gut in good health when youre pregnant because you absorb nutrition better when your gut is functioning properly and you have a good balance of bacteria. And so having a probiotic (in addition to extra dairy), gives you tons more calcium and vitamin D. I also started taking a DHA supplement. It helps keep baby brain at bay and makes sure that you and baby are getting enough DHA (since babies need it to develop their nervous system).  AdvertisementTB: Have you had any weird or embarrassing pregnancy moments so far? Especially because youre on TV for most of it?DO: Its a very interesting experience. I didnt really know what to expect and  I hope that Ive done somewhat of a good experience hiding it  but there have definitely been moments on TV where I feel like Ive just completely left my mind. Im talking to 3 million people and suddenly I just have to wing it! You know, you have this great idea cued up and it just evaporated! And this might be a little embarrassing, but everyone on the staff knows that if they cant find me its because Im peeing. Before I got pregnant, there were two things I prided myself on: The first was having an iron bladder, and the second was that I had the memory of an elephant. Now, both those things have just completely gone out the window!TB: Are you nervous about becoming a first-time mom?DO: Its the first grandchild for my parents and my husbands parents and its also the first great-grandchild on both sides of our families, so everyone is over the moon. This child is going to be so spoiled! Im also the first of my friends to have a baby, so I didnt really know much going into this about what to expect; you just know that youre having a baby so things are going to be really different. Im a little nervous because Im 27, so I still feel like Im in that post-college, not 100 percent adults stage; you know, not totally defined by Girls but in some ways, I still am. And Im so lucky to have a great group of girlfriends and we make it a priority to see each other and spend time together, but I know that once baby arrives, things are going to change dramatically. Its not so much that Im scared  just so interested to see how capable I am of balancing everything.  AdvertisementIts been so nice to go to prenatal classes and meet other moms-to-be in my area  theyre the best resources on the best parks to go to, where to buy baby supplies. Im sort of the guinea pig for all my friends!TB: Are you stressed about what your body after baby will look like?DO: I struggled with my weight a large majority of my youth. I even wrote a book about it. In college, I dropped the weight and adopted a healthier lifestyle. I refuse to go back to being totally neurotic about getting my body back or going on a diet or anything like that because I just remember how unpleasant it was and how it stole my love of food. I love to eat and thats how my family bonds. Thats not something Im willing to give up just to drop a size in my jeans. That said, my postbaby plan has been to try and stay as healthy as possible during my pregnancy. I think its better for baby to stay healthy and it also makes my life easier afterwards. Im looking forward to jumping back into real workouts because you do get a little nervous when youre pregnant thinking you could hurt the baby, so Im looking to get back to that without hurting anything (or anyone!). I try to follow an 80/20 rule: 80 percent healthy and 20 percent living for delicious food and great, worthwhile indulgences.TB: Thats a great rule to follow! One last question, do you have a favorite healthy, go-to snack?  AdvertisementDO: Yogurt is amazing and lately, Ive started carrying around baby carrots in addition to nuts. I also just discovered this Paleo granola. Its so delicious, all nuts and seeds, no grains, and it even has a little maple syrup to sweeten it  but not too much. When I went for my first sonogram, I was at the hospital and you know, you have to have a full bladder so they can look at the baby. I showed up in the waiting room with about 30 other pregnant women and all of us had to pee really badly! But I noticed that all the women had snacks  and I didnt!

Foods to Ease Pregnancy Symptoms,https://www.thebump.com/a/pregnancy-foods-ease-symptoms,"The symptom: Morning sicknessWhat to eat: GingerWhen youre feeling queasy, gingers your best friend. Brew ginger tea, chew candied ginger, snack on ginger snaps or sip ginger ale. Hint: stirring the soda to get the bubbles out makes it easier on the stomach, says Suzanne Merrill-Nach, MD, fellow at the American Congress Of Obstetricians And Gynecologists. Dont like the taste of ginger? Its also available in capsule form (if you can stomach the idea of swallowing something whole).What else you can doLet your aversions be your guide. You might naturally want to avoid strong smells and spicy foods. You can also experiment with the temperature of your food, suggests Melinda Johnson, RD, Director of the Didactic Program In Dietetics at Arizona State University and spokeswoman for the Academy Of Nutrition And Dietetics. You may get relief from eating cold foods, such as gelatin or a smoothie (yum). Other options that can be stomach settlers include raw veggies, cold sandwiches, lemon slices and, of course, crackers.Know that nausea is more likely to happen on an empty stomach  hence the name morning sickness, as thats when youre likely the hungriest. If you tend to feel nauseous when you wake up, keep crackers by your bed to nibble on right away.Also, eat sparingly but often. Consuming frequent, small meals is easier on your stomach than having three large ones a day. And dont worry too much: whatever you can tolerate is the right thing to eat, says Merrill-Nach. If youre throwing up, it doesnt matter if its not the perfectly well-balanced diet.  AdvertisementThe symptom: ConstipationWhat to eat: BeansBeans, berries and broccoli will boost your fiber intake, to keep things running smoothly. High-fiber breakfast cereals and oatmeal are also easy ways to ease this common pregnancy symptom. (sorry about this one.)What else you can doKeep a glass or bottle of water with you and drink from it as much as you can. Hydration is important to keep your digestive system moving. Also, Merrill-Nach says, the calcium in prenatal vitamins can, um, stop you up. Ask your OB to recommend a vitamin that contains a stool softener, which could get things going again.The symptom: HeartburnWhat to eat: BananasIn general, acidic foods bring on the burn, making low-acidic fruit, such as bananas and melons, a good choice to lessen heartburn symptoms. Avoiding acidic foods can help, but in pregnancy, its not so much about trigger foods. In other words, you might sometimes be able to say that the chili you ate at lunch caused your heartburn, but in general, you can just chalk it up to being pregnant.What else you can doPay attention to what you eat and when you eat it. You might want to skip spicy foods and not nosh too close to bedtime, which can cause heartburn. Also, dont lie down for at least an hour or so after eating a meal. If you do, Johnson recommends using lots of pillows to prop yourself up in a comfortable position and keep an antacid on your nightstand, Merrill-Nach suggests.The symptom: Fatigue  AdvertisementWhat to eat: SpinachIts common to become iron-deficient or anemic in pregnancy, making you even more tired (if thats possible). If youve had pregnancies close together or if you follow a vegetarian diet, you can probably count yourself among that group, says Merrill-Nach. Vegetarians tend to have lower levels of vitamin B-12 and iron. Adding more iron-rich foods may help boost energy. That includes red meats, beans, leafy green vegetables like spinach and fortified breakfast cereals. Ask your doctor if you should also be taking an iron supplement.What else you can doYou might not realize it, but staying hydrated is key to keeping your energy level up. When youre dehydrated, your blood becomes a bit sluggish moving through your body  making you sluggish too, explains Johnson. Besides sipping water, you can eat soup, fruits and veggies to increase your fluid intake. But remember, youre pregnant: feeling tired is a given in the first trimester  no matter what you do. Rest as much as you can for now. And know that in the second trimester, youll get back some of your energy.The symptom: SleeplessnessWhat to drink: Warm milkA cup of decaffeinated tea or warm milk (plain or flavored) before bed helps some moms-to-be drift off to dreamland, says Johnson. But skip the hot cocoa if youre sensitive to caffeine  it has a small amount of it, so youre better off sipping just plain milk.Caffeine, in general, should be limited in pregnancy to less than 200 milligrams (about the amount in a 12-ounce cup of coffee) per day. And avoiding it may help you get the zs you need.  AdvertisementIf you cant kick your caffeinated-coffee or -tea habit completely, try not to drink it late in the day, when its more likely to interfere with sleep.What else you can doSupporting yourself with extra pillows at night can make you more comfortable and help you snooze better. You can use a big pregnancy body pillow or place a cushion between your knees to alleviate any back pain that may be keeping you up.Experts: Suzanne Merrill-Nach, MD, fellow at the American Congress Of Obstetricians And Gynecologists and private practice ob-gyn in San Diego; Melinda Johnson, RD, Director of the Didactic Program In Dietetics at Arizona State University and spokeswoman for the Academy Of Nutrition And Dietetics Plus, more from The Bump:Pregnancy Symptoms10 Pregnancy Foods to Eat for BabyPregnancy Diet: What to Eat When You're PregnantRelated Video"

Its not at all uncommon for a toddler to suddenly become fixated on one food  and ignore all others. Or for a toddler to only eat things that are one color, or to restrict his food intake to four or five favorite foods. Remember: Toddlers are beginning to realize that theyre independent human beings, and they love exercising their ability to make choices.Stop focusing on what your child isnt eating, and take a good look at what he is eating over the course of a week. If, during the week, your toddler is eating a variety of foods from each food group, hes probably fine. If hes completely missing (or barely touching) certain food groups, he might need a nutritional boost. Toddlers who refuse to eat meat (or are vegetarian) may be short on iron or vitamin B12. And almost all toddlers (and adults) will benefit from some vitamin D supplementation, as it can be hard to get the recommended amount of 400 IUs (International Units) from dairy products alone.So while most kids dont need a multivitamin, many end up taking a multivitamin because its easier to find a kid-friendly multivitamin than individual vitamin supplements. The most convenient way to do vitamin supplementation, Ive found, is with a multivitamin, says Michael Lee, MD, a pediatrician at Childrens Medical Center in Dallas. The advice I give parents is to let your child pick the multivitamin so we know its one theyll take. I also advise parents to make sure the vitamin contains 400 IUs of vitamin D and tell them that if they have a choice of iron vs. no iron, to get one with iron. A lot of kids have iron-deficient diets, and iron deficiency can cause developmental delays.

Lactose Intolerance During Pregnancy,https://www.thebump.com/a/lactose-intolerance-during-pregnancy,"What is lactose intolerance during pregnancy?People who are lactose intolerant lack lactase, the enzyme that normally digests a sugar called lactose. Since lactose is found in dairy products, eating them makes you feel sick. If youre lactose intolerant, youre probably wondering how to get the calcium you need during pregnancy without getting sick.What are the signs of lactose intolerance during pregnancy?The most common signs of lactose intolerance are abdominal pain, bloating, cramping and gas after ingesting dairy products. Sounds a lot like general pregnancy symptoms, right?Are there any tests for lactose intolerance during pregnancy?Yes. Sometimes a doctor diagnoses lactose intolerance based on symptoms. If you consistently experience abdominal pain, bloating and gas after eating or drinking dairy  but you feel fine after cutting dairy out of your diet  youre probably lactose intolerant. A simple breath test or blood test, performed in a doctors office, can confirm the diagnosis.How common is lactose intolerance?Pretty common. Its more common in adults (who dont have the same biological need to drink milk that young kids do), and its more common among people of African, Asian, South American or Native American descent.How did I get lactose intolerance?It might be genetic. Other times, lactose intolerance is caused by an injury to the small intestine, which normally produces lactase.How will lactose intolerance affect my baby?You dont have to drink milk to have a healthy baby, but you do need to make sure to get enough calcium. Know that baby will be fine no matter what  even if you skimp on calcium  but thats because your body will draw calcium from your bones and teeth to make sure your baby has what she needs to grow healthy and strong. And that can have devastating long-term effects on your own health, causing osteoporosis (see next page for tips on getting enough calcium without dairy).  AdvertisementWhats the best way to treat lactose intolerance?You can avoid dairy altogether. If you cant tolerate cows milk, try almond, soy or rice milk. Calcium is also in kale, broccoli and salmon. Some women with lactose intolerance can handle yogurt, so you might want to try it to see how it goes.It can be hard to reach the recommended pregnancy intake of 1,200 mg of calcium per day without eating or drinking dairy, so many pregnant women who are lactose intolerant take calcium supplements. If youre choosing between a calcium carbonate and a calcium citrate supplement, Michelle Collins, CNM, an assistant professor of nurse-midwifery at Vanderbilt University, recommends going with the citrate. Calcium citrate is much more absorbable and doesnt cause constipation, so it tends to work better for pregnant women.You can also try Lactaid, which is an over-the-counter form of lactase that allows you to digest lactose (and eat dairy!).What can I do to prevent lactose intolerance?You cant prevent lactose intolerance, but you can manage the symptoms.What do other pregnant moms do when they have lactose intolerance?I think I may have developed an intolerance to lactose over the last three months... I have been keeping track of my reaction to dairy and it is becoming increasingly unpleasant... I mainly have problems with just straight milk. Most cheese and yogurts don't cause me nearly as much discomfort! I have been taking calcium supplements throughout the pregnancyAround the beginning of my second trimester I realized that milk was making me suffer. Anything containing real cream is even worse. [So Im avoiding those.]  AdvertisementAre there any other resources for lactose intolerance?

"Sinusitis During Pregnancy Laura Riley, MD OB-GYN",https://www.thebump.com/a/sinusitis-during-pregnancy,"What is sinusitis during pregnancy?Sinusitis is just a fancy name for a sinus infection. It happens when your sinuses become inflamed and swollen, and mucus cant drain properly. Its bad enough when youre not pregnant, but its even worse when you are pregnant because its hard to tell whether the symptoms are caused by an actual infection or just your hormones.What are the signs of sinusitis?You may see some yellow or greenish discharge (yuck!) from your nose. You also might have trouble breathing through your nose, feel pain and pressure around your face and have a bad cough, and your senses of smell and taste might not seem to be working so well  sounds like fun, huh? Other symptoms include earaches, headaches, sore throat and fatigue.Are there any tests for sinusitis?Your doctor may give you a nasal endoscopy to see whats going on inside your nose. If she suspects that allergies are the culprit, you may be tested for them.How common is sinusitis during pregnancy?It can be more common during pregnancy. The tricky thing about dealing with sinus issues is figuring out whether they're pregnancy-related. That's because pregnancy can cause the blood vessels and membranes in your nose to swell (yep, its not just your ankles), making it tough to breathe through your nose  even if you're not sick at all. But luckily, even if you are sick, most sinus infections do go away with time. The important thing to figure out is whether your symptoms are caused by pregnancy or an actual infection, so be sure to talk to your doctor.  AdvertisementHow did I get sinusitis?Along with all the crazy things pregnancy does to the blood vessels and membranes in your nose, you can get sinusitis from viral, bacterial and fungal infections. If you have allergies (like hay fever), you may have an increased risk of getting sinusitis.How will sinusitis affect my baby?Luckily, it wont affect baby. But make sure youre still getting enough vitamins and nutrients and resting so you can recover ASAP.Whats the best way to treat sinusitis during pregnancy?If your symptoms are just pregnancy-related, saline nose drops and running a humidifier at home can help you feel more comfortable. Those treatments also can help if you're sick with a sinus infection, but you'll probably have to wait it out. The exception is a bacterial infection, which will likely be accompanied by fever and possibly yellow or green mucus; for that, your doctor may prescribe a pregnancy-safe antibiotic.Before you take any medicine, check with your doctor. Things like Sudafed and Actifed are usually fine for most pregnant women to take for a short period of time (though not all doctors recommend them), but if you have certain medical conditions, like hypertension, you should avoid them.What can I do to prevent sinusitis during pregnancy?Stay as healthy as you can during pregnancy by avoiding contact with people who have colds. Try to avoid environments with bad air quality (like being around smokers or polluted air). If you have allergies, make sure youre taking care of them. You can also use a humidifier to ward against any infections.

Weight Loss During Pregnancy,https://www.thebump.com/a/weight-loss-during-pregnancy,"What is weight loss during pregnancy?  It certainly seems strange to lose weight when youre creating a whole-new person, but its probably nothing to fret about if youre in your first trimester.  What could be causing my weight loss during pregnancy?  Morning sickness and the accompanying loss of appetite can cause you to shed a few pounds in the first trimester. Don't worry  you'll more than make up for this loss in the upcoming months. And remember, most women only gain between three and five pounds in the first trimester.  When should I go to the doctor with my weight loss during pregnancy?  If you continue to lose weight or simply cant keep anything down, talk with your doctor.  What should I do to treat my weight loss during pregnancy?  Still, you can (and should) take action to ensure you and baby get the nutrients you need.Prenatal vitamins are the way to go, though you might want to try one with a low dose of iron (the mineral can actually make nausea worse). And try to eat whenever you can stand it. An empty stomach can actually trigger nausea, as can low blood sugar, so eat before youre hungry and always keep snacks nearby. Getting extra sleep and cutting down on stress will also work wonders for your appetite. For an alternative remedy, try ginger (ginger ale, ginger candies, ginger beef with snow peas). It has a long history of making tummies feel better. Or slip on an acupressure wristband, found at most drugstores. The bands  meant to ward off motion sickness  have helped many an expectant mom fight the queasies.  Advertisement  Plus, more from The Bump:   Weight Gain During Pregnancy Related Video"

Hair Issues During Pregnancy?,http://www.thebump.com/a/hair-issues-during-pregnancy,"Sorry for some women, thick and lustrous is no more than a myth. Hormones (yep, blame them for this one, too) hit every head differently. The lucky ones wind up thick and full; others, limp and thin. And sometimes, hair just starts to seem a little different. Dry hair might turn oily, curls might straighten, and a perm or a dye might produce totally unexpected results. One bonus for the limp and thin: Hormones can also cause hair to sprout in less exciting places (think face, belly, back and legs) making that thick hair a little less attractive.Though you cant change your hormones, there are a few ways to promote luscious, healthy locks. Start with a nutritious diet. Yogurt, fresh fruits and veggies, seeds, whole grains and cold pressed oils are especially good for hair. Dry, brittle hair that falls out easily or lightens in color might be a sign of iron, iodine or protein deficiencies. If your hair is undernourished, take five minutes every day to massage your scalp, which stimulates circulation. Home oil treatments are another great way to fight frizz. Massage half a cup of warm vegetable or olive oil into your scalp and hair, and let it soak under a shower cap for half an hour or so. Add a few drops of lavender or rose essential oils to the treatment for some aromatherapy.Related Video"
11 Things to Avoid When Trying to Conceive,https://www.thebump.com/a/what-to-avoid-when-trying-to-conceive,"SmokingYoure probably already planning onquitting smoking once you get pregnant (and you definitely should), but avoiding cigarettes now will be a huge benefit too. According to the American Society for Reproductive Medicine, it takes longer for smokers to conceive, and smokingmakes a woman's eggs more prone to genetic abnormalities. Smoking increases the risk ofmiscarriage and ectopic pregnancy. In fact, the habit wreaks so much havoc on fertility that female smokers who have in vitro fertilization have to attempt it almost twice as many times as nonsmoking women doin order toconceive. Oh, and your partner should quit smoking too. Men who smoke cigarettes havelower sperm count and motility (swimming speed), and more sperm abnormalities.Too much caffeineRelax: You don't have to cut out your morning cup of joe. But if you consume more than 200 milligrams of caffeine  that's aboutone to two eight-ounce cups  per day, you should ease up. Heavy caffeine consumption has been associated with fertility problems. Plus, you won't want to overdo it during pregnancy (caffeineinterferes with your ability to absorb iron, can dehydrate you and, in highdoses,can increasemiscarriage andpreterm birth risk), so it's worth cutting back now.Binge drinkingSorry to break the news, but you should skip your friends' bar crawl while you're trying to conceive, or at least stick to sparkling water while you're there. That's because drinking to excess (more than two drinks each day) is linked to irregular periods,lack of ovulation, and abnormal estrogen and progesterone levels, which can make it harder to conceive. Plus, if you're charting, it can make it challenging totemp accurately.  AdvertisementThe other reason why you might want to nix the alcohol is because, well, you'll have to anyhow once you get pregnant, to eliminate the possibility of fetal alcohol syndrome, and it will take about two weeks (or more) after you conceive to know that you're actually pregnant. Tell your partner to limit his alcohol intake too. There's evidence that drinking can affecthis fertility as well.Extremes in weightDo you think you might be extremely overweight or underweight? Calculate your body mass index (BMI) using this tool now.Having a lowBMI (18.5 or less) or a very high BMI (over 30) could cause you to have irregular or missed periods. Andbeing extremely underweight couldmake you stop ovulating altogether.Obesity can increase the risk of pregnancy complications such as gestational diabetes, preeclampsia, birth defects and the need fora c-section. So it's important to be at a healthy weight when you're trying to conceive.If you fall into either of these categories, talk to your doctor about how to get to a healthy weight. You'll want to eat right, getting plenty of nutrients; exercise; and drink plenty of water. Often, even a small weight gain or loss is enough to get your body ready to make a baby, as long as it's done healthily.Passing on the veggiesThe jury's out on whether certain foods actually make you more fertile, but there's one thing the experts agree on: If your body's in a healthy state, you're more likely to conceive, so eating right is essential. The other important reason to say no to the fries and yes to the spinach salad is folic acid. This B vitamin is found in leafy greens and is important to have present in your body before and after conception to prevent birth defects. Doctors recommend you also take a vitamin with at least 400 micrograms of folic acid while you're trying to conceive.  AdvertisementNeglecting your teethIf you've been lax, now's the time to get back on track with your dentist appointments  and make sure you're flossing. You and your partner shouldbothget your pearly whites super-healthy before you get pregnant. Poor oral hygiene can affect a man's sperm, and if you have gum disease, it could increase your risk of having a premature delivery and low-birth-weight baby. Yikes!Being a couch potatoKeep making excuses not to exercise? Stop! One study found that doing regular, moderate physical activitybrisk walking, leisurely cycling, golfing and gardeningcut the amount of time it took women to get pregnant.Extreme exerciseYou want to stay fit, but you don't want to overdo it. In the same study we mentioned above, vigorous exercise increased the amount of time it took women to get pregnant. We're not saying to skip your morning run if that's what you've always done, but working out to the point of interfering with your menstrual cycle,as some marathonrunners and gymnasts experience,can mess with your fertility.BPATime to invest in a metal water bottleBPA, aka bisphenol A, is a chemical found in plastic items, such as water bottles, food containers and even in the lining of aluminum cans. Some studies have led scientists to believe that highBPA exposure could mess with men's and women's fertility, potentially lowering sperm count or reducing the number of viable eggs. There's virtually no way to prevent BPA exposure altogether, but you can limit yours by avoiding canned foods and avoiding consuming anything from a plastic container with the recycling number 3 or 7 on it (usually on the bottom of the container).  AdvertisementStressing out We've all got a little bit of stress in our lives, and experts disagree on whether stress can _cause _infertility. But there's evidence that chronic or intense stress can do a number on your reproductive system, and, well, having trouble getting pregnant can cause quite a bit of stress! So if you feel that your stress levels might be affecting your health and your ability to conceive, talk to your doctor about ways to cope. Several studies have found that alternative medicines, such as yoga and acupuncture, have actually shortened the time it took for infertility patients to get pregnant.High-mercury fishSome fish are higher in mercury than othersmost notably marlin, orange roughy, tilefish, swordfish, shark, king mackerel, and ahi and bigeye tuna. High levels of mercury in the blood have been linked to fertility issues in both men and women. Plus, mercury can stay in your system for a year or more, and can harm a fetus's developing brain and nervous system, so avoiding it will increase your chances of a healthy pregnancy. Love seafood?

How Your Hair And Skin Change After Giving Birth,https://www.thebump.com/a/postbaby-skin-and-hair,"Those first few months after having baby are usually filled with stress, sleepless nights, and lovely hormonal changes (yay!) that may or may not affect your skin and hair. Dont worry, this doesnt mean theyll never return to the way they were. But if youre starting to notice some major postbaby changes, be aware that youre not alone and prepare yourself for how to deal.Solving the skin problemsWhile some moms find themselves saddled with oily skin, others wind up with dry and flakey postbaby skin. Moms with oily skin should turn to oil-free makeup and toners (check out Shaklees Minerelles line of natural-based makeup), try out new cleansers (two of our personal faves: Origins frothy face wash and Neutrogenas Oil-Free Acne Wash pink grapefruit facial cleanser), and invest in tried-and-true blotters like Clean & Clears portable oil-absorbing sheets. Tip: If youre in a pinch and on the go, stop at any restroom with a toilet seat cover dispenser and rip off a piece of the wax paper to blot away oil. Works like a dreamtrust us.For moms who are suddenly battling dry skin, try an oil-free moisturizer that will restore your skin without clogging your pores. Some of our favorite oil-free moisturizers are actually designed for moms-to-be but work just fine postpregnancy. Check out Basqs Rebalancing Facial Cleanser, filled with micro exfoliants and made from exotic flower blossoms, or try the Complete E Cranberry Creme by Derma-E, which will restore your skin with natural vitamins.Noticed any dark splotches on your face lately? Dont freak out  these are caused by your bodys increase in melanin production (a skin pigment) and are totally normal. Eventually your melanin levels will return to what they once were, but it might be after baby is weaned from breastfeeding. You can help prevent this by staying out of the sun as much as possible and protecting yourself with a moisturizer or foundation that has sunblock in it. (Our pick: bareMinerals Complexion Rescue Tinted Hydrating Gel Creama moisturizer with SPF 30 that comes in 10 shades)  AdvertisementIf youre suddenly dealing with sporadic breakouts, try Beaute de Mamans all-natural Face and Body Cream. Not only is it specially designed for combating blemishes, its also perfectly safe for both pregnant and nursing women.Battling those stretch marksWhile a whopping 90 percent of us will get stretch marks sooner or later, some are hit a little harder than others (and we can blame this one on genetics). Try to preserve your skins firmness and elasticity during and after pregnancy. We highly recommend Bella Bs Tummy Honey Stick, made with all-natural products.Sprucing up that new-mommy hairAnother little-known postbaby fact is that most new moms actually lose their hair after giving birth. Before you freak out, remember that almost everyone goes through it and that its a natural result of your hormones trying to sort themselves out. While most nonpregnant women lose about 100 to 125 hairs a day, new moms often lose up to 500 hairs a day after delivery. True, its a hard thing to watch your hair fall out, but calm yourself with the thought that it will go back to normal in six months or so.In the meantime, you can mask your thinning hair with some tried-and-true volumizing products like Bumble and Bumbles Thickening Hairsprayor Frederic Fekkais Full Volume Mousse. Another trick is to blow-dry with a larger, round brush to add volume and give the illusion of a fuller head of hair (we love the Cricket Technique Thermal Ionic Brush #450).Of course, if your postbaby skin or hair problems persist well beyond six months after delivery, its best to talk to your doctor and see if there may be any underlying medical issues causing your problems.Related Video"
What Happens At Baby's Two-Month Checkup? Anisa Arsenault ...,https://www.thebump.com/a/babys-two-month-checkup,"Brace yourself for a whole lot of shots. Preeti Parikh, MD, explains what else usually happens at this checkup.Questions the doctor will ask How are things going? Do you have any concerns? Is there anything new going on? Is baby holding his head up, cooing and smiling? Are there signs he recognizes mom and dad? Are you breastfeeding or using formula? How frequently? (At two months, baby is probably still feeding every two to three hours.) If its formula, how many ounces is baby drinking per day? How many times does baby poop per day, and how many times does he pee? Are there any signs of dairy intolerance, like diarrhea or blood in stools? What is babys sleep schedule like? (Sleep is especially important for brain development, and baby should still be sleeping for the majority of the day.)Procedures the doctor will doWeight check. Just like last month, the doctor or nurse will measure and weigh baby, and plot weight, height, and head circumference on a growth chart that indicates the average height and weight for boys and girls. Dont freak out about the numbers. What really matters isnt babys percentile  its that baby stays within the same percentile range from checkup to checkup.Physical. The doctor will check babys heart, joints, eyes, ears, mouth, lungs, genitals and reflexes. Shell also check the shape of babys head and check his soft spots (fontanels) to make sure theyre developing properly.Vaccinesbaby may get  AdvertisementThese come at the end. Depending on the practice, some are given in combo vaccines. Pneumococcal (PCV) DTaP Hib Polio vaccines Rotavirus vaccine (given orally) Hepatitis BRecommendations the doctor will make If your baby is breastfeeding, youll need to supplement with vitamin D droplets. Parikh recommends sticking to liquid in a syringe, because its hard to tell if baby actually consumed all of the vitamins when you mix it with formula or breast milk. To lower the risk of SIDS, make sure that baby is still sleeping on his back.Expert: Preeti Parikh, MD, is a pediatrician in New York City and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics.Related Video"
Q&A: Which formula should I use?,https://www.thebump.com/a/which-formula-is-most-like-breastmilk,"None of them. Baby formulas have come a long way and are now infused with all sorts of vitamins, minerals, and whatnotbut its just not possible for them to contain the same properties as a mother's milk. Breast milk contains live cells and antibodies, varies in taste with the foods that you eat and changes its nutritional content constantly to meet your baby's needs as he grows. Also, the vitamins and minerals in breast milk have a much higher bioavailability than those in formula  meaning more of them are absorbed by baby's body. Formula companies are constantly advertising a new ingredient that makes their formula more like breast milk, but this same rat race has been in progress for more than a century.If you need to supplement for a medical reason, rest assured that most major brands of infant formula are very similar to each other in composition.Related Video"
Q&A: Tearing during delivery?,https://www.thebump.com/a/tearing-during-delivery,"Sorry, but theres no surefire way to prevent tears in the skin surrounding your vagina during delivery. (Yes, ouch.) But, some studies do show that regular perineal massage during the final six weeks can reduce your risk. This technique gently stretches the vaginal opening, making it more elastic and better able to fit around baby's noggin.To perform the massage yourself, wash your hands and lube up your fingers with KY jelly, vegetable oil or vitamin E. Sit on your bed or on the floor with your knees bent and your legs slightly spread. Place your thumbs three to four centimeters inside your vagina, with the pads of your thumbs pressing on the bottom. Use your thumbs to stretch the vaginal opening downward and to the sides, and hold until it stings slightly. Then gently but firmly massage the bottom half of the vagina, and place a thumb inside and pull outward on the lower rim. Repeat twice a day, and feel free to ask your partner for help! Remember, though: Despite some studies that show that women who massage have fewer tears, many OBs believe it helps very little (or not at all).Related Video"
How Breastfeeding Changes As Baby Gets Older Elena Donovan ...,https://www.thebump.com/a/how-breastfeeding-changes-as-baby-gets-older,"Youll spend less time doing itGood news if you feel like all you did during the newborn period was feed your son or daughter: Once baby gets the hang of nursing, he or she will probably get better at it, which usually translates to faster. A newborn feeding can take 20 to 40 minutes, but by the time they get to be three months old, they often cut way back on feeding duration, says Nancy Mohrbacher, IBCLC, FILCA and author of Breastfeeding Answers Made Simple: A Guide for Helping Mothers. It could become 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the baby. Chances are baby will still be nursing every two to three hours, but doing it more efficiently, so you two will likely quickly move on to the next activity.Youll worry less about how much baby is drinkingIn the beginning, you probably were always freaked out that baby might not be getting enough milk and secretly wishing you had ounce markings to gauge babys intake, the way bottle-feeding moms do. But the awesome thing about breastfeeding is that baby knows when he or she's hungry, will let you know and will stop when he or she is full. Your baby is signaling to your body to make the right amount of milk with the right amount of nutrients, vitamins and antibodies according to babys age, says Gina Ciagne, CLC for Lansinoh Laboratories. As long as babys healthy and gaining the right amount of weight, hes getting plenty of milk. Unless youre pumping, you dont really have to count anything!If you are pumping during the day while youre at work, dont freak out if you see the amount you pump drop, especially after baby starts on solids. Thats normal. As they start solids, they need less, says Mohrbacher.  AdvertisementIts not just about the milkBabies dont just nurse for nourishment; they also get comfort and closeness from it. And that can become more and more obvious as baby becomes older and is exposed to a whole bunch of new emotions and experiences. Breastfeeding can stop a tantrum, soothe a toddler whos just fallen or give you two bonding time before you leave for work in the morning. Breastfeeding is an all-purpose mothering tool, says Mohrbacher. Of course, if you schedule babys feedings, you might just be providing food, but our experts say feeding on demand can offer great emotional benefits.Baby may get more easily distractedAround 6 to 10 months, baby will be nursing along and then suddenly pull off to point and squeal at a plane going by overhead. Youll get him or her latched on again, and then two minutes later, he or shell whip off again to watch big brother or sister run by with a ball. Baby will be moving around a lot more (usually rolling, crawling and cruising), and you may find that he or she is more interested in exploring the world around him or her than focusing on feeding when you want him or her to. To limit distractions and the stop-and-go feeding time, Ciagne recommends finding a quiet setting for feedings, like babys nursery or another not-so-chaotic place.You may get bittenWhen you see babys first tooth break through the gums, youll probably be really excited, but a little bit nervous about getting the old bite-down. (Luckily, your baby isnt the one from Twilight.) Not every baby bites, says Mohrbacher. For the ones who do, its usually because their gums get sore from teething, and baring down on something makes them feel better. She recommends giving your baby a cool washcloth or teething toy before a feeding, so baby gets any gnawing out of his or her system. If baby does manage to give you a nibble, stop the feeding right away so baby knows that behavior isnt going to fly. Eventually, he or shell get the message.  AdvertisementSolids will gradually take overAround six months, babys pediatrician will likely give you the go-ahead to start solid foods. The process will be gradualyou'll introduce one new food at a time, and baby will take some time getting used to eating and trying different flavors. Over time, breast milk will take a backseat to solid foods, but in the beginning, its still the most important part of babys diet. Its good practice to nurse first and then offer baby solids, so they get enough milk and uses the solids as practice, says Ciagne.Other milks get transitioned inAround age one is when many parents start incorporating other milks, like cows milk and soy milk, into their babys diet. You might have to get baby used to drinking from a cup or to the flavor of the other milk, so just like with solids, this will probably be a gradual process. And it doesnt mean thats the end of your breastfeeding relationship (see below).Theres no such thing as extended breastfeedingThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding until six months and then continuing at least until the age of one, and many parents misinterpret that into meaning that theyve got to stop by babys first birthday. The benefits of breastfeeding dont magically stop at 12 months, says Ciagne. Only you are the correct judge of the amount of time is right to continue breastfeeding. If you and baby are still enjoying it, keep going. If you truly believe its time to stopno matter the agethen thats the right choice for you.People may think youre crazyyou're notOther than the cover of Time magazine, you dont see moms of older babies and toddlers nursing them in public very often. And its not because no ones doing it or that the moms are trying to hide something. Its just that its easy to tell a toddler to wait until you get home, and because he or she isn't nursing as often anyway, it might happen to only be going on in the morning or night, when no one else is around. So when you tell people youre still nursing your childwhether hes nine months or four yearssome might be shocked. But believe us, there are plenty of moms like you still doing it.

10 Breastfeeding Superfoods,https://www.thebump.com/a/what-to-eat-breastfeeding,"OatmealOats are a completely natural whole grain, high-fiber food. A bowl of oatmeal will keep you full for a long time after breakfastand may help increase your milk supply. Plus, oats are high in iron; and iron-deficiency anemia, which is common in new moms, can mess with your milk supply.Good news: Quick oatsthe kind that cook up in about a minuteare just as healthy as steel-cut oats, which can take much longer to prepare. But avoid pre-packaged instant oatmeal, which usually contains extra salt and sugar.AlmondsAlmonds arent just packed with protein; theyre a good non-dairy source of calcium. And the every little bit helps. Breastfeeding moms should take in 1000 mg of calcium per day. Thats because the milk you make is high in calcium, and if you dont get enough in your diet, your bones and teeth could be robbed of calcium they need. (Yikes!)There are some exceptions though. If youre allergic to almonds, theyre obviously a no-no. And if your family history includes a history of nut allergies, you might want to hold off on them until your baby is at least 3 months old, since food proteins more easily pass from a mom to her babys bloodstream (via the babys gut) in the first three months of babys life.ApricotsApricots contain dietary fiber, vitamin A, vitamin C and potassium, all essential nutrients. Eating apricots can also increase prolactinthat's the hormone that tells your body to produce milk. Fresh, whole apricots are a better source of fiber than canned apricots; if you go canned, look for ones packed in water or natural juices, instead of sugary syrup. Dried apricots are also easy to toss in the diaper bag for an on-the-go snack.  AdvertisementSalmonThis tasty, fatty fish might be the perfect meat for breastfeeding moms. Its high in protein, and also contains large amounts of DHA, a type of fat thats important to the development of babys nervous system. Wild-caught or farm-raised salmon are both good for you. If you dont eat dairy, you can eat canned salmon, which contains tiny salmon bones, to get some extra calcium.YogurtStocking your fridge with yogurt is smart because the creamy stuff has got both protein and calcium (and with all those flavors available, youre bound to find a few you love). Just beware that some breastfeeding moms are told to give up dairy if baby is diagnosed with milk protein intolerance. Signs your baby could be one of them include frequent spitting up, diarrhea, bloody stools, rashes, coughing and wheezing.BeansFiber-rich kidney, black, pinto and other beans can be good for your digestive system, and theyre fantastic sources of iron and protein. Its true that you might get a little, um, gassy, after eating beans, but when passed through breast milk, they wont give your baby gas. Promise.SpinachActually, pretty much any dark green, leafy veggie is a breastfeeding super food. That includes broccoli and Swiss chard. Theyre all-around nutrient-dense and even high in calcium. (This ones for you vegan moms!) So you can get a veggie serving and a calcium-rich serving in one, delicious, leafy food. Plus, we love how versatile spinach can be. Eat it fresh in a salad, sautee it as a side, or add it to lasagna or another favorite entre.  AdvertisementDatesDates are another calcium-rich foodand theyre thought to help increase milk supply, since they increase prolactin like apricots do. Theyre also a high-fiber, naturally sweet treat. Chop some and add them to your morning oatmeal.Sesame seedsWho knew? Sesame seeds are packed with calcium, and are a good source of fiber, iron, magnesium, phosphorus, copper and manganese. Toast them and sprinkle them over a salad of dark leafy greens. Or add some to your veggies; green beans and sesame seeds are a tasty combo.Brown riceSkip the white stuff. Brown rice is better for you because its got more fiber and other nutrients. Complex carbs like brown rice (and oatmeal) help keep you full and keep your blood sugar at consistent levels (no drastic energy dips!). Dont have time to boil a pot of brown rice? Instant and boil-in-bag brown rice have the same nutrition content as the regular kind, but require less effort.Plus, more from The Bump:10 Ways to Eat Healthy While Breastfeeding6 Smart Ways to Lose the Baby Weight While Breastfeeding9 Things Every New Mom Should Have In Her KitchenRelated Video    All medical information reviewed by    Dr. Paula Prezioso    of Pediatric Associates in New York City."

It might feel as if your skin is crawling! Usually, it gets worse when youre not moving your legs or in the evening and night. You might also constantly move in your sleep or have trouble sleeping.Are there any tests for RLS during pregnancy?No. RLS is diagnosed based on symptoms and a physical exam. Your doctor may test your iron levels, though, since RLS is sometimes a sign of low iron or anemia.How common is RLS during pregnancy?Pretty common  about one in four pregnant women get it.How did I get RLS during pregnancy?There are a few potential causes of RLS. You could have low levels of iron or folate, or your changing hormones could be to blame. Your legs might feel more sensitive because anyswelling you might have is compressing your nerves.How will my RLS affect baby?It shouldnt. But some drugs used to treat RLS could harm baby, so talk with your doctor before taking any RLS medications.Whats the best way to treat RLS during pregnancy?Do everything you can to prep your body for a good nights sleep: Avoid caffeine, dont smoke or drink alcohol, and get regular exercise during the day. Take short warm baths, stretch often and try massage  and when youre sitting still, keep yourself busy and alert (knit, play a game, have a good conversation).  AdvertisementIf youre having trouble sleeping, dont fight the urge to move.

I only have a couple of suggestions: Try running hot water at the end of your shower if you shower just before going to bed. Or try rubbing your legs (like when you put lotion on). I find that if I counter the overstimulation with slower stimulation, it will calm down.I'm pretty sure I have undiagnosed restless legs syndrome! I get like this almost every night before bed. I have my husband tickle (like a slow tickle) or rub my legs for me. It really helps a lot. I also get it when I sit for longer periods of time, but the only thing that helps is to walk around.What's helped the most for me is soaking my legs and feet in hot water just before bed. And actually, for the past two days I was out of town and had to do a lot of walking  I wound up soaking my legs and feet two to three times a day, and guess what? No restless legs for the past two nights! I'm back at home now and am going to try to keep up the same routine and see if it works.

Lactose Intolerance in Babies,https://www.thebump.com/a/lactose-intolerance-baby,"What is lactose intolerance in babies?Babies and toddlers with lactose intolerance lack the enzyme lactase, which is what helps break down lactose, the sugar found in milk. Since people with lactose intolerance cant break down this milk sugar, the lactose travels through the stomach into the gut undigested and causes fluid to move from the gut tissue into the gut itself, which causes cramping, nausea, abdominal pain and diarrhea, says Mark Moss, MD, a pediatric allergist at the University of Wisconsin Hospitals and Clinics.What are the symptoms of lactose intolerance in babies?A baby or toddler with lactose intolerance may be fussy after feedings. He or she may also have belly pain and diarrhea within an hour of having food or drink containing cows milk.Are there any tests for lactose intolerance in babies?Yes, but lab tests usually arent necessary. Babys pediatrician can check the levels of acid in baby's stool or order a breath hydrogen test, which measures the hydrogen in your childs breath after consuming lactose. To do the breath test you'll need to visit the pulmonary function lab of a hospital. But instead of testing, its usually much easier to cut lactose out of babys diet for a period of time to see if symptoms improve. If they do, your doctor will probably have you reintroduce dairy to baby to see if the symptoms return. If they do, it's likely baby has lactose intolerance. How common is lactose intolerance in babies?Very rare. Because milk is the natural first food of all humans, babies are typically born ready, willing and able to drink (and digest) milk. The exception is premature infants, since lactase levels usually increase during the third trimester. If baby was born early, he or she may not have enough lactase to adequately break down lactose. Interestingly, lactose intolerance becomes more common in kids after age 2, since lactase levels begin to taper off after that age.  AdvertisementHow did my baby get lactose intolerance?People of some ethnic backgrounds (Asian, African or Native American) are more prone to lactose intolerance than people from a Northern European background. In babies, though, the most likely cause of lactose intolerance is prematurity.Whats the best way to treat lactose intolerance in babies?Its best to avoid dairy altogether. Soy milk and/or soy-based formula can be used in lieu of cows milk or cows milk formula. As baby gets older, he or she may be able to tolerate small amounts of dairy. If not, you can always put lactase dropsbasically, artificial lactasein baby's meals to help him or her digest dairy. Ask your doctor which are the best ones to use.What can I do to prevent my baby from getting lactose intolerance?You really cant do anything to keep baby from getting lactose intolerance. But you can learn how to manage it to prevent its symptoms.What do other moms do when their babies have lactose intolerance? My daughter is lactose-intolerant. She gets horrible diaper rash with even a few tablespoons of regular milk. I give her lactose-free milk, which is vitamin-D-fortified, and she also eats yogurt and cheese. I just cook with the lactose-free milk rather than regular milk. Keira is severely allergic to milk; we actually had to take her to the ER after her drinking four ounces of it. We did the blood work for allergies, and it came back with her being allergic to eggs, peanuts, wheat, soy and milk. The soy allergy must be light, because we have her on soy milk.  AdvertisementWe suspected lactose intolerance or milk allergy with my son at about 2 months old. He was fussy with breastfeeding and also fussy with regular formula. We used soy formula, and he was better. At age one, we tried whole cow's milk, but it resulted in extreme fussiness and vomiting. So we went to soy milk, rather than back to soy formula. He does well with the soy milk. At 18 months, we had allergy testing done, and he tested negative to all items tested. So we tried cow's milk again, which resulted in the same thing: fussiness and vomiting. So were still on soy milk and have an appointment scheduled with a pedi GI. Were going to try Lactaid to see if we can determine if it ismilk protein intolerance or lactose intolerance.Are there any other resources for lactose intolerance in babies?American Academy of Pediatrics HealthyChildren.orgNational Digestive Diseases Information ClearinghouseRelated Video"
"Taking Cough Syrup To Get Pregnant? Laurence A. Jacobs, MD ...",http://www.thebump.com/a/cough-syrup-to-get-pregnant,"Back in the mid-80s, reports started to spread that a certain brand of cough syrup (yes, its Robitussin) could help improve fertility. The thought was that this expectorant  originally engineered to help loosen and thin mucus in the lungs  could also have an effect on mucus a little lower down, in the cervix. One of the active ingredients in the cough medicine, called guaifenesin, helps liquefy mucus in your lungs, so you can cough it up and out of your body. But it also theoretically works on other mucous membranes, including your cervix, which in turn would make it easier for sperm to travel through to fertilize an egg. Unfortunately, though, theres been no clinical evidence that the drug can help you conceive any more quickly. It probably cant hurt (though too much unnecessary medication is never a good thing), but its likely that any success you have will be more due to coincidence than the medication itself.Plus More From The Bump:Foods That Increase FertilityAvoid These Foods While PregnantVitamins You'll Need to ConceiveRelated Video"
What medications are safe during pregnancy?,https://www.thebump.com/a/what-medications-are-safe-during-pregnancy,"Many over-the-counter medications are safe during pregnancy, but there are a few surprising drugs that can lead to problems for baby. In general, always speak with your doctor prior to taking any medication (prescription, over-the-counter, or herbal/homeopathic) and always follow the dosage instructions on the package. Also, keep in mind that certain vague symptoms you wouldnt think twice about in normal times (a headache, for example) can actually be a sign of a more serious pregnancy-related complication. And before taking any over-the-counter medication, think about what other medications you are taking. Even medications that are considered safe in pregnancy can become dangerous when they interact with others. If you're not sure, again, always check in with your ob-gyn.Here are some common pregnancy problems, along with a quick summary of related meds that are probably safe... and ones that probably aren't.Aches and pains: Acetaminophen (Tylenol) is okay to take for treating general aches, pains and headaches. But you want to steer clear of NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs), which includes ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin) and naproxen (Aleve). These OTC drugs may be associated with congenital heart defects when taken during the first trimester, and they've also been linked to other heart abnormalities and low amniotic fluid levels when used in the third trimester.Congestion and allergy symptoms: Antihistamines such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) and loratidine (Claritin) appear to be safe during pregnancy. Avoid pseudoephedrine (Sudafed) since it may be associated with birth defects involving baby's abdominal wall. Also, decongestants (such as phenylephrine) may affect blood flow to the placenta, and should generally be avoided throughout your pregnancy.  AdvertisementCough: Two major cough medication ingredients  dextromethorphan (a cough suppressant) and guaifenesin (an expectorant, which means it loosens up thick mucus)  both appear to be safe during pregnancy, although both have been tested in relatively few studies.Constipation: Both Metamucil and stool softeners like Colace appear to be safe in pregnancy. Laxatives, mineral oils and rectal suppositories may stimulate labor, so these should only be used after speaking with your doctor.Heartburn: Antacids such as Tums and Mylanta appear to be safe in pregnancy, and for most women, they significantly improve heartburn symptoms. If antacids aren't enough though, famotidine (Pepcid) and andranitidine (Zantac) do not appear to be associated with any pregnancy complications.All this said, there are situations where the potential benefit of taking a medication outweighs any potential risk to baby. The most important piece of advice regarding medication  talk with your doctor! Be honest about your questions, concerns and medical history and you should be just fine.

Can I take an SSRI while trying to conceive?,https://www.thebump.com/a/antidepressants-getting-pregnant,"Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors, or SSRIs, are a class of drugs that make up a large percentage of antidepressants. You probably know them better by their brand names, like Prozac and Paxil. They work by blocking the reabsorption of the neurotransmitter serotonin in the brain, which in turn helps boost your mood. The majority of SSRIs are considered relatively safe during pregnancy. That said, its safest for your baby for you to go off the medication or minimize its use before getting pregnant. However, given the complex hormonal soup and the accompanying flood of emotions that pregnancy can bring  including depression  thats not always the most practical or ideal scenario. Youll have to talk with your own doctor about whats right for you. Keep in mind that certain types of SSRIs are considered less safe than others. Paxil, for example, has been associated with an increased risk of heart defects among newborns when taken in the first three months of pregnancy.Plus, more from The Bump:The Vitamins You Need to ConceiveWill allergy shots affect my changes of getting pregnant?Can I take Paxil if I'm trying to get pregnant?Related Video"
