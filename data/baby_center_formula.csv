Choosing to formula-feed,https://www.babycenter.com/0_choosing-to-formula-feed_471.bc,"I want to formula-feed my baby, but everybody says it's better to breastfeed. Is this true?Both formula feeding and breastfeeding are valid, healthy choices for your baby. The decision to do one or the other  or a combination of both  is purely personal and depends on what's right for your family and circumstances.Breast milk gives your baby the best possible nutrition, protects against infection, and even adjusts to meet your infant's nutritional needs (something formula can't do). You benefit too: Breastfeeding helps you bond with your baby, and research suggests it may even lower your risk of ovarian and breast cancers.If possible, you may want to try nursing, at least for the first month, so your natural immunities can be passed to your child.Or, consider a combination of breastfeeding and formula feeding. If you're nursing, it's okay to give your baby formula once a day as long as your breast milk supply is well established, which usually happens within a month of giving birth. Some women supplement this way because formula feeding gives them a break (especially in the middle of the night) and lets their partner help feed the baby.That said, exclusive formula feeding  either right from the start or after a period of nursing  is also a healthy way to feed your baby. Formula even has some vitamins and other nutrients that breastfed babies have to get from supplements, like vitamin D.If you're concerned about your choice, try to separate the medical facts from the political and cultural rhetoric. Your child's doctor will work with you to make sure your baby is getting all the nutrients she needs and chart her growth to make sure she's growing well. In the end, the most important thing you can do for your baby is love and nurture her  and that includes feeding her whichever way you choose.There are plenty of reasons women choose to formula-feed. Among them are having a baby with a poor sucking reflex (common in premature babies), prolonged mother-infant separation, painful nursing, the fear that your baby isn't getting enough milk, the need to return to work, a health problem that requires medication that's not safe for a nursing infant, and a desire to let other family members help feed the baby.Which type of formula should I use?Most formulas are made from cow's milk or soybeans. There are also specialized formulas for babies who are allergic to milk or soy proteins, and for babies who are premature or have a low birth weight. Any formula you choose should be iron-fortified to prevent anemia. To find out more about choosing the right formula for your baby, see our article and talk to your baby's doctor.Why can't I just feed my baby cow's milk?Never feed your infant cow's milk. It's just not recommended until after your baby's first birthday because it doesn't have the proper nutrients in the right proportions for a growing infant. It can also cause digestive trouble.Find out more about when to transition your child to regular cow's milk and how to make the switch.What are follow-up formulas, and should I switch to one?Follow-up formulas are specifically designed for babies 4 to 12 months old who are already eating some solids. Follow-up formulas contain more calcium, iron, protein, and calories than infant formulas.Most babies don't need follow-up formula. Doctors encourage parents to introduce solid food (baby cereal, pureed meats, fruits, and vegetables) to their babies at 4 to 6 months, rather than fill them up with formula.Still, it depends on the individual child. Babies with food allergies, those who are very sensitive to different foods, and those with a history of poor growth may benefit from follow-up formula. Talk to your doctor about what's best for your baby.I'd like to supplement breast milk with formula. How should I do it?Lactation consultants suggest waiting to introduce a bottle until the baby is 4 weeks old. By then, breastfeeding is usually well established, but your baby's not yet likely to resist a new kind of nipple. (Nursing and taking a bottle require different types of sucking.)It's best to have someone else give the first bottle because your baby can smell you and your milk and may refuse to take a bottle if you're nearby.If you plan to use formula for occasional feedings, don't offer more than one bottle every 24 hours. Otherwise, your milk production could slow down. If you're returning to work soon and plan to have your caregiver give your baby formula while you're away and nurse when you're home, ease into it by replacing one feeding with a bottle every three to four days.Get more tips on supplementing with formula.Show sources Hide sources AAP.

Breastfeeding and supplementing with formula,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-and-supplementing-with-formula_8484.bc,"Is it okay to supplement my breastfed baby's diet with formula?Yes, it's perfectly safe to supplement a breastfed baby's diet withformula. Some moms decide to supplement with formula when they go back to work. They may have trouble pumping regularly, but they don't want to give up nursing entirely.Others supplement because their baby isn't getting enough breast milk to grow properly. And many moms just want the freedom to let a family member or babysitter give an occasional bottle.Whatever your reasons for supplementing, keep in mind that any amount of breast milk is always better than none, so the longer you can nurse your baby, the better  even if it's just once or twice a day. Although formula provides all the nutrients your baby needs, it lacks the unique immune factors that can protect your baby from some illnesses.Will supplementing with formula affect my milk supply?Your supply of breast milk depends on your baby's demand for it, so the less often you nurse, the less milk your breasts will produce.If you supplement with one or two bottles a week, the effect on your milk supply should be minimal. But if you start supplementing with formula regularly, even for just one feeding a day, your milk supply will diminish (at least until you reinstate the missed feeding).You can alsopump breast milkwhen you're giving your baby supplemental formula to build up a bank of expressed milk to freeze and use later. This will help to keep your milk supply up, even as you're bottle-feeding with formula or breast milk more frequently.Nursing bra buying guide (Before You Buy series) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 3:28Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -3:28Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosHow do I know whether my baby's getting enough breast milk?Many mothers worry that they're not producing enough milk for their babies, but most women make plenty of milk. Here are three ways you can tell whether your baby's getting enough:Plenty of dirty diapers. A baby younger than 1 month old who's nursing well will have frequent mustard-yellow stools. Some babies have one after every feeding. Your baby will also have six to eight wet diapers a day if he's getting enough breast milk.Weigh your baby several times a week. He should be gaining an average of half an ounce to an ounce a day during the first three months, and half an ounce a day between 3 and 6 months.Frequent, round-the-clock nursing. You're breastfeeding at least seven times every 24 hours. (During your baby's first month, you should nurse even more, at least eight to 12 times per day.) Even if your baby wants to nurse all the time, that doesn't necessarily mean he's hungry. Some babies nurse for comfort, have a strong urge to suck, or simply crave contact with their mother.What are some signs that my baby needs supplemental formula for growth?Talk to your baby's doctor if you have any concerns about your baby's weight gain, growth, or eating habits. Here are some symptoms that warrant a call:More than normal weight loss in a newborn. Babies lose up to 10 percent of their birth weight during the first five days of life. By day five, they start to gain about an ounce a day, and by 2 weeks they should be back up to their birth weight.Your breasts don't feel soft or empty after nursing, which could be a sign that your baby isn't taking in enough milk.Fewer than six wet diapers in a 24-hour period once your baby is 5 days old.Fussiness or lethargy most of the time.Baby bottles and nipples buying guide (Before You Buy series) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 3:08Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -3:08Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosWhen can I start supplementing with formula?If your baby is a newborn, you might want to wait until he's at least a month old before you introduce formula. Lactation consultants recommend waiting this long to allow your breastfeeding routine and your milk supply to become well established so an occasional bottle won't disrupt the routine too much. At this age most babies aren't completely reluctant to try a bottle or a new food source.If your baby is over a month old, you can offer formula at any time.What's the best way to introduce a bottle?Unfortunately there's no perfect way to start supplementing, and it's common for babies to refuse formula in a bottle initially. Don't give up too easily  it may take more than a few tries to get your baby to drink formula from a bottle.Some babies will just go with the flow and, if they're hungry, take whatever you give them. Others may refuse a bottle the first few times it's offered, especially if you're the one offering it. That's because your baby can smell you and would probably prefer the real thing, which is sweeter.If your baby is used to taking a bottle of breast milk, the transition may be a bit easier, though she may turn up her nose at what'sinthe bottle.To make this transition smoother, let your partner or a friend offer the first few bottles. You might also try giving the bottle when your baby is hungry rather than at a feeding when she might be nursing as much for comfort as for nourishment.Can I mix breast milk and formula in one bottle?Lactation consultants say it's better not to mix breast milk with formula because you may end up wasting that hard-earned breast milk if your baby doesn't finish the bottle. Instead, feed your baby the pumped breast milk first, and if he still seems hungry, offer a new bottle with formula.How will supplementing with formula affect my baby?If you start supplementing regularly, your baby might start refusing the breast. A bottle delivers milk faster than a breast, so if your baby's an enthusiastic eater, she might prefer the bottle's quick delivery system.If your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.You might also notice that your baby's willing to go a little bit longer after a meal of formula. That's because babies don't digest formula as quickly as they digest breast milk, so they're likely to feel full longer.Your baby's bowel movements will be markedly different once she's drinking some formula. They'll be firmer than they were when she was drinking only breast milk, about the consistency of peanut butter. They'll be tan or brown in color, have a stronger odor, and probably be less frequent than when she was drinking only breast milk.If your baby's vomit or stool contains spots of blood after you introduce formula, call your baby's doctor. This is a sign of milk intolerance.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011a. Bottle feeding.

Formula feeding and the flu,https://www.babycenter.com/0_formula-feeding-and-the-flu_10324643.bc,"This article is adapted from information published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Johns Hopkins Children's Center.Can I bottle-feed formula to my baby if I have the flu?Yes, but with caution. While you're sick with the flu, you'll need to take precautions to protect your baby from your germs. Babies younger than 6 months old are at most risk because they're too young to get a flu shot, and babies with the flu can suffer serious complications. The safest option is to have someone else prepare your baby's bottle and feed him.If that's not possible, try to limit your baby's exposure to your germs in other ways. For example:Wash your hands with soap and warm water before touching or holding your baby, or preparing his bottle. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner.Frequently clean household surfaces, such as the kitchen counter, sinks, light switches, and doorknobs.Wear a face mask.If you can't wear a face mask, sneeze or cough into your elbow or a tissue. (Watch this kid-friendly Elmo video by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services for a lesson on the best way to sneeze.) If you sneeze into a tissue, throw it away and then wash your hands.Put a clean, dry cloth blanket between you and your baby every time you hold or feed him.Don't share eating utensils, drinking glasses, washcloths, towels, beds, pillows, or blankets with your baby until you've been symptom-free for at least five days.Check with your healthcare provider to see if antiviral drugs are an option for you. They can ease your symptoms and shorten the length of your illness, which means less chance of exposure for your baby.Can I formula-feed my baby if he has the flu?Yes  and be extra sure he's getting enough. Babies need more fluids when they're sick, especially if they have dehydrating symptoms, like a high fever, vomiting, or diarrhea.While he's sick, keep up your baby's fluid intake, and watch him for signs of dehydration. If you also breastfeed your baby, read our article on flu and breastfeeding.What if I'm having trouble feeding my baby while he's sick?If your baby's too sick to drink, try offering smaller amounts of formula from a cup, syringe, or eyedropper.How can I protect myself and my baby from the flu?Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and your baby from the flu. The CDC and AAP recommend that nearly everyone  including pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers get an annual flu shot as soon as they become available each fall.Your baby can't be vaccinated until he's at least 6 months old. But if you and the other adults who are often in close contact with your baby get a flu shot, he'll have a better chance of staying healthy.Note: The CDC and AAP do not recommend the nasal spray flu vaccine (FluMist) for the 2016-2017 season because it isn't effective.For the most up-to-date information on the current flu season, check the CDC's flu site or call the CDC at (800) CDC-INFO or (800) 232-4636.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2016a.

How much formula your baby needs,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-much-formula-your-baby-needs_9136.bc,"It can be tricky to figure out how much formula to give your baby. Is he getting too much or too little? How much is enough? The answers depend mostly on how much your baby weighs and how he's growing.How much formula to feed your baby: Where to startIn general, babies eat when they're hungry and stop when they're full. But formula-fed babies tend to be heavier than breastfed babies, appetites vary among babies, and each baby's nutritional needs change from day to day and month to month.That may sound complicated, but if you follow the basic guidelines below and check in regularly withyour baby's doctor, your baby will likely be on track.Watch the video: See real parents at a doctor's appointment with their newborn, getting advice about how to tell whether their baby is getting the right amount of formula. Signs your formula-fed baby is eating the right amountSometimes babies eat too much formula, and sometimes not enough. Learn what to watch for.Our guidelines are for babies who are exclusively formula fed for the first four to six months, and then fed a combination of formula and solids up to age 1.Don't give your baby more than 32 ounces of formula in a day, and once he starts eating solids, you'll probably need to cut back on the amount of formula you feed him. Your baby's doctor can tell you where your baby falls on thegrowth chartsand help make sure he's growing steadily and getting a healthy amount of formula.Note: If your baby is getting a combination ofbreast milkand formula, talk to his doctor for more detailed advice.How much formula by babys weightIn the first four to six months when your baby isn'teating any solids, here's a simple rule of thumb: Offer 2.5 ounces of formula per pound of body weight each day.For example, if your baby weighs 6 pounds, you'll give her about 15 ounces of formula in a 24-hour period. If she weighs 10 pounds, you'll give her about 25 ounces in a 24-hour period.These numbers are not rigid rules. They give you an overall average for what your baby is likely to require. His daily feedings will vary according to his individual needs  in other words, he may want a bit more on some days and a bit less on others.Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.How much formula by signs of hungerLearning to read your baby's hunger cues will help you know when and how much formula to feed your baby.Your new baby:If your newborn is hungry, she'll eventually cry. But crying is a late sign of hunger. Earlier signs to watch for include smacking her lips or sucking, rooting (turning her head toward your hand when you stroke her cheek), and putting her hands to her mouth.Changing appetites:Your baby may be hungrier than usual during growth spurts. These typically occur ten to 14 days after birth and at age 3 weeks, 6 weeks, 3 months, and 6 months. And your baby may be less hungry than usual if she's not feeling well.Wanting more:You'll know that your baby wants more when she finishes the feeding quickly and looks around for more. If she seems hungry after her first bottle, try preparing just an ounce or two more at a time. If you make a larger amount, she may not finish it andyou'll have to throw it out.Getting too much in a feeding:Vomiting after a feeding may be a sign that your baby had too much. (Spitting up is normal, vomiting isn't. Find outhow to tell the difference.) Tummy pain after a feeding can also be a sign of overfeeding. If your baby draws up his legs or his tummy seems tense, he may be in pain.(See six other possible reasons forstomach pain in babies.)It's not always hunger:Resist the urge to respond to your baby's every whimper with a bottle. Consider the possibility  especially if you've recently fed her  that she's crying because her diaper is wet, she's cold or hot, she needs to be burped, or she simply wants to be close to you. For more help, see12 reasons babies cry and how to soothe them.How much formula by babys ageIn the first week, formula-feed your newborn on demand. After that, it's important not to overfeed your baby so he'll stay at a healthy weight.Most new babies want to eat every few hours. Start with 1.5 to 2 ounces at each feeding for the first week, and work up to 2 to 3 ounces every three to four hours.As your baby gets older  and his tummy gets bigger  he'll drink fewer bottles a day with more formula in each. By about 1 month, for example, he may be down to five or six bottles of 4 ounces every 24 hours. And by 6 months, he'll typically be down to four or five bottles of 6 to 8 ounces per day.He's likely to maintain that four-to-five-bottle pace until his first birthday, when he can transition to whole cow's milkin a bottle orsippy cup, along withthree solid meals and two snacks between mealsper day.Signs that your baby's getting the right amount of formulaThese are signs that your baby's getting all the formula she needs:Steady weight gain. She continues to gain weight after her first two weeks and maintains the same pattern of growth during her first year. (Most babies lose up to 10 percent of their birth weight and then regain it by the time they're about 2 weeks old.)Happy baby. She seems relaxed and satisfied after a feeding.Wet diapers. She wets five to six diapers a day if you're using disposable diapers, or six to eight if you're using cloth diapers. (Disposables hold more liquid.)Worries that your baby's getting too much or too little formulaIf you're worried that your baby is getting too little or too much formula, talk with his doctor. The doctor can check your baby's weight and growth, tell you whether his intake is appropriate for his size and age, and advise you about any adjustments you may need to make.Solutions to formula feeding problemsFor answers to other formula feeding questions, visit ourFormula Feeding Problem Solver.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012.

Formula Feeding,https://www.babycenter.com/baby-formula-feeding,
How to buy baby formula,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-buy-baby-formula_1334669.bc,"I'm bottle-feeding my baby. Which formula is best?It's easy to feel overwhelmed in the formula aisle. Choosing the right nourishment for your baby is a pretty weighty decision, and there are lots of options.When choosing formula, consider the form it comes in, the type of protein and carbohydrate it provides, and what other ingredients are included. In the end, you'll be able to choose the formula that is best for your baby and your family's lifestyle.What are the different forms of formula?Formulas come in three forms: Ready-to-use, liquid concentrate, and powdered.Ready-to-use formula is undoubtedly the most convenient  no mixing or measuring required, just open and serve. It's the kind of formula that hospitals often give to newborns. It's hygienic and especially helpful when you don't know whether you'll have access to safe water.The convenience of ready-to-use formula comes at a price  this kind costs about 20 percent more per ounce than powdered formula. The containers also take up more storage space in your cupboard and more space in the landfill (unless you can recycle the containers).Once opened, ready-to-use formula has a short lifespan  it must be used within 48 hours. Also, because liquid formula is often darker than powdered formula, many moms complain that it's more likely to stain clothes.Liquid concentrate formula requires mixing equal parts of water and formula. Compared to ready-to-use formula, concentrate is less expensive and takes up less storage space. Compared to powdered formula, it's a little easier to prepare but more expensive.Powdered formula is the most economical and the most environmentally friendly formula option. It takes up the least amount of space in transport, in your pantry, and in your trash can.Powdered formula takes more time to prepare than other types of formula, and you must follow the directions exactly, but it has a one-month shelf life after the container has been opened. As with liquid concentrate formula, you can mix up just the right amount  as much or as little as you want  whenever you need it. This is especially helpful if you're a breastfeeding mom who may only need a supplemental bottle occasionally. What are the different types of formula?There's a formula to suit every baby's needs. But it's best to stick with one type and resist the urge to switch, even if your baby seems like he's not digesting the formula well at first.Common problems  like spitting up, gas, and colic  are usually unrelated to your baby's diet. Most of the time, these problems have to do with your baby's immature gastrointestinal tract, not what he's eating.So try out a particular type of formula for at least a couple weeks. After that, if your baby's still having trouble, talk to his doctor about switching.Cow's-milk-based formula: Most formula available today has cow's milk as the main ingredient. The overwhelming majority of formula-fed and formula-supplemented babies do best with this type of formula because it has just the right balance of protein, carbohydrate, and fat. The milk protein in formula is significantly altered to make it easier to digest. Your baby won't be able to digest regular cow's milk until after his first birthday.Partially and extensively hydrolyzed formulas: In these formulas, the protein is broken down into small parts (partially hydrolyzed) or even smaller parts (extensively hydrolyzed) that are easier for your baby to digest than larger protein molecules. Your baby may need a hydrolyzed formula if he has a milk protein allergy or trouble absorbing nutrients (a common problem for preemies). The doctor may also suggest trying a hydrolyzed formula if your baby has a skin condition such as eczema.Soy-based formula: These formulas are made with a plant protein that, like the protein in cow's milk, is modified for easy digestion. Although soy-based formulas are a good option for vegan families, there are only a few medical reasons for using them. These include:Transient lactose deficiency: a temporary lactose intolerance caused by a gastrointestional infectionImmunoglobulin E (IgE)-associated allergy to cow's milk: an allergy to cow's milk protein that causes immediate symptoms, including wheezing, runny nose, hives, and rashes. Many babies with IgE-associated milk allergy are also allergic to soy protein, so don't give soy formulas to your child unless your doctor recommends it.Galactosemia: a rare inherited disorder in which the body is unable to break down a milk sugar (galactose) to produce energyCongenital lactase deficiency: an extremely rare inherited disorder in which a baby is born with very little or none of the enzyme that breaks down the sugar lactose found in milk, causing life-threatening lactose intolerance symptomsLactose-free formula: A case of lactose intolerance or an inability to digest lactose  the sugar naturally found in milk  is rare. If your baby is lactose intolerant, his doctor may recommend a soy formula or another formula in which the lactose is replaced with a different sugar, such as corn syrup.Formula for premature and low-birth-weight babies: These formulas often contain more calories and protein, as well as a more easily absorbed type of fat called medium-chain triglycerides (MCT). How much MCT is in these formulas varies by brand. Your baby's doctor will help you select the one that will help your baby gain just the right amount of weight.Human milk fortifier: This product is used to enrich the nutrition of breastfed babies who have special needs. Some are designed to be mixed with breast milk, and some are meant to be fed alternately with breast milk.Metabolic formula: If your baby has a disease that requires very specific nutrition, he may need one of these specially developed formulas.Organic formula: According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), no research to date has proven organic milk to be healthier for children than regular milk. Since standard formula is based on milk, parents may want to consider whether organic formula is worth the higher price.Other specialty formula: New formulas come out all the time and are marketed to moms to help babies with digestion to relieve problems such as colic or acid reflux. These formulas have a protein ratio similar to breast milk and vary slightly in composition from regular formula  but some experts say they may not be any better.""More often than not, specialty formulas are substantially more expensive and not significantly different in key nutritional value, says KT Park, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Stanford's Lucile Packard Children's Hospital. ""Babies undergo tremendous adaptation of their gastrointestinal tract during the first six months of life, which is normal. There are very few scenarios in which infants would require the more expensive formulas.""If you think your child might benefit from a specialty formula, ask your child's doctor about it before you stock up. How do formulas differ?There are five main components to formula: Carbohydrate, protein, fat, vitamins, and minerals, plus other nutrients in smaller quantities. What makes one brand of formula different from the next are the specific carbohydrates and proteins as well as any additional ingredients. For example, casein and whey are two kinds of cow's milk proteins found in various proportions in different brands of cow's-milk-based formula.It's very easy to get confused by all of the items listed on the ingredient label. Below is a guide through the maze of ingredients and a comparison to the ones found in breast milk.Carbohydrate: Lactose is the main carbohydrate in both breast milk and formulas made from cow's-milk. Corn maltodextrin is sometimes used as a secondary source of carbohydrate in formula. Lactose-free, soy, and special formulas contain one or more of the following carbohydrates: Sucrose, corn maltodextrin, modified cornstarch, or corn syrup solids.Protein: Breast milk contains about 60 percent whey and 40 percent casein. Most formulas have similar protein content. Others contain 100 percent whey.Partially hydrolyzed formulas are not hypoallergenic  don't use one if your baby has a protein allergy, or even if you suspect she may have one. However, compared to standard cow's-milk formula, partially hydrolyzed whey formulas have been shown in studies to reduce eczema.Extensively hydrolyzed formulas contain proteins that are completely broken down into their building blocks (amino acids), which allow them to be easily absorbed. These formulas are considered hypoallergenic and are used for babies who have a protein allergy.Soy formulas contain soy protein isolate  a processed soybean ingredient that is almost pure protein (at least 90 percent). Some brands use partially hydrolyzed soy protein (protein is partially broken down) to allow easier digestion.Fat: Breast milk contains a blend of monounsaturated, polyunsaturated, and saturated fat. Formulas use a variety of oils to match the fat makeup of breast milk. They include soy oil, coconut oil, palm or palm olein oil, and high oleic sunflower oil.Although palm and palm olein oil is widely used, research has shown that these fats can reduce absorption of fat and calcium. This would mean that your baby would not absorb as much fat and calcium as she would from a formula that doesn't contain this oil.Medium-chain triglycerides require less effort to digest and are more easily absorbed. They're used in special formulas for premature infants and for infants who have trouble digesting or absorbing nutrients.The federal Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the addition of two long-chain fatty acids to formula: DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and ARA (arachidonic acid), which are now standard ingredients in formula. Both of these substances are found in breast milk when the mother's diet is adequate, and both are important for brain and vision development. Babies get DHA and ARA from their mother during the third trimester, but the transfer is cut short when a baby is born prematurely. All babies need a steady supply of both substances throughout their first year.Numerous studies support the supplementation of formula with DHA and ARA. One, a report published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, showed that full-term infants fed DHA- and ARA-supplemented formula had significantly clearer vision than infants who did not receive the supplements. And a study published in The Journal of Pediatrics states that DHA and ARA enhanced both cognitive and physical growth in preterm infants.There aren't any long-term studies confirming the safety of these substances, although there's no evidence suggesting that these additives are harmful to babies, either. The AAP hasn't taken a position on whether these fatty acids should be added to formula, but the organization does point out that they're believed to be important in brain and eye development.Vitamins and minerals: Most words on the ingredient label describe vitamins and minerals. These words can be hard to figure out  ferrous sulfate is iron, for example. Sodium ascorbate is vitamin C, and calcium pantothenate is vitamin B5.The AAP recommends that all healthy babies who aren't breastfed exclusively be given iron-fortified formula until their first birthday. It's important that babies receive the minimum recommended amount of iron (0.27 milligrams [mg] daily for infants 0 to 6 months; 11 mg daily for babies 7 to 12 months) to prevent iron-deficiency anemia.Iron is vital to the blood's ability to circulate oxygen, which all of the body's cells need to function properly. Studies have shown that getting enough iron in the first year of life is important for brain development. A baby's iron stores are established in the third trimester, so premature babies need extra help in getting plenty of iron.Most formulas contain at least 4 mg of iron per liter, although ""low-iron"" formulas are still on the shelves. These were developed years ago in response to the misconception that iron causes constipation. The AAP would like these low-iron formulas to be discontinued or labeled as nutritionally inadequate.Nucleotides: These are the building blocks of DNA and RNA, naturally present in breast milk. They have several functions and may aid in immune system development. Different brands of formula have different amounts of nucleotides added.Rice starch: Rice starch is added to ""anti-regurgitation"" formulas. Your doctor may recommend this type of formula to alleviate your baby's acid reflux.Dietary fiber: Soy fiber is added to soy formula for the temporary treatment of diarrhea. The only formula containing fiber is Similac Expert Care for Diarrhea, which is clinically shown to reduce the duration of diarrhea.Amino acids: Amino acids such as taurine, methionine, and carnitine are added to soy formulas, and sometimes to cow's-milk formulas, to match the amino acids in breast milk.Probiotics and prebiotics: Probiotics are a type of live bacteria that may help prevent intestinal infections and inflammation. Prebiotics boost the numbers of probiotic bacteria in the gut.The AAP says some studies show probiotics and prebiotics can play a role in keeping your child's digestive system healthy but they can also be unsafe for babies with compromised immune systems and certain other medical conditions, so it's best to check with your baby's doctor before using these formulas. Any benefit from probiotics and prebiotics goes away once your baby stops using them. Are generic brands nutritionally adequate?Generic brands of formula must meet the FDA's requirements for nutrients in formula, so in many instances, the only difference between generic and brand name is the price.Whether you're buying generic or name brand, take a minute to look at the label before you purchase the formula. Specific ingredients do vary from brand to brand, and this can make a difference to your baby.Can I make my own formula?Doctors strongly advise against it. If you made your own formula, it would be impossible to include all the ingredients in the right amounts for your baby. Homemade formula could lead to failure to gain weight, malnourishment, or even death.What about adding cereal or milk to my baby's formula?Never add any ingredients  including vitamins, cereal, fatty acids, olive oil, regular cow's milk, or anything else  to your baby's formula unless your doctor recommends it. Formula is a carefully developed substance with precise amounts of dozens of nutrients. Adding anything to formula could jeopardize your baby's health.Olive oil, for example, can lead to permanent lung damage and even death, because of the danger of inhaling the oil into the lungs when spitting up. Because cow's milk is so hard for babies to digest, never mix cow's milk with formula or give it to your baby straight until he's at least 1 year old. And adding breast milk to formula is a waste of breast milk if your baby doesn't drink the entire bottle.What if I'm still not sure which formula is right for my baby?If you've decided to feed your baby formula and you're still baffled by the many options available, or you're considering switching formulas, talk with your baby's doctor. He'll consider your baby's health, age, and nutritional needs and make an appropriate recommendation.He can also monitor your baby's reactions and investigate any symptoms. Don't try to diagnose an allergy or sensitivity on your own. You could miss a serious underlying condition or prevent your baby from getting adequate nutrition.If you'd like to learn more, visit the FDA pages on infant formula.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Formula feeding: Helping your baby get used to the bottle,https://www.babycenter.com/0_formula-feeding-helping-your-baby-get-used-to-the-bottle_6421.bc,"Whether your child is a newborn just starting to formula-feed, a breastfed baby getting supplemental formula, or a baby transitioning from breast milk to formula, she'll need a little time to adjust. The first few feedings may be a little awkward, but don't worry  she'll soon get the hang of it. Read on for some ways you can make bottle feeding go smoothly.What's the best way to bottle-feed my baby?As with breastfeeding, most experts agree that you shouldn't follow a rigid schedule in the early weeks when formula feeding, though you may be able to work out an approximate pattern for feeding within a month or two. Offer the bottle every two to three hours at first, or as your baby seems hungry.Also, keep in mind that the way a baby sucks from a bottle is very different from the way she sucks from a breast because getting milk from a bottle is easier. (Some babies prefer the bottle for this reason.)Don't force more than she seems ready to eat. Until your baby weighs about 10 pounds, she'll probably take 1.5 to 3 ounces per feeding. Your baby's doctor can advise you about suitable amounts for your baby as she grows.Bottle feeding can be just as nurturing as breastfeeding, so cuddle your baby close. Some babies like to be held in a nursing position while drinking from a bottle, but others find it disconcerting. Whatever position you choose, try to maintain eye contact with your baby. (And don't feed her while she's lying on her back because she may choke.)Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.What can I do if my baby resists taking a bottle?Whatever technique you decide to use, be consistent and try it a few times, especially in the beginning. Here are a few tips:Offer your baby a bottle before he gets too hungry. You want him to be interested in food, but not so hungry that a cold nipple frustrates him. (Cold rubber or latex isn't that appealing.)Let your baby play with the nipple. If he just chews on it, let him for now. He's becoming familiar with it and may actually start sucking on it soon.Hold him in a different position. Put him in an infant car seat so he is semi-upright, and then feed him the bottle while facing him. Or try feeding him on your lap with his back to your chest. Once he's used to taking a bottle, you can hold him as you usually would for feedings.Try different temperatures. It could be that your baby prefers his milk slightly warmer or colder than you've been giving him. Experiment with different temperatures to see what he prefers.(Never use a microwave to heat a bottle of formula. A microwave heats unevenly and can create hot pockets, leading to burns. It can also cause the nutrients in formula to break down.)Let someone else introduce the bottle. If you're supplementing breastfeeding, it may help to let your partner or another caregiver give your baby the first bottle. Your baby knows your scent and associates it with breastfeeding.Offer the bottle at other times. For example, if your baby has been refusing the bottle during the day, offer it in the evening.Whichever technique you use, remember that your baby needs time to get used to new sensations, so stick with the same nipple, bottle, and feeding technique for a while before trying something different.I feel guilty for not breastfeeding. What should I do?Whatever your reason for not breastfeeding, give yourself a break. Formula feeding is a valid, healthy choice for babies. Formula even has some nutrients that breastfed babies have to get from supplements, like vitamin D.Find out more about formula feeding."
How to use baby formula safely,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-use-baby-formula-safely_1334673.bc,"Preparing baby formula isn't hard, but it's important to mix it with water in the correct ratio so your baby gets the right amount of nutrients. It's also important to take precautions to protect him from foodborne illnesses because he doesn't have much immunity to germs just yet, especially as a newborn. Here's what you need to know.Check the expiration dateThe U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requires manufacturers of infant formula to analyze each batch to verify nutrient levels and stamp every container with a ""use by"" date  just like the ones found on milk, eggs, and other perishables.When you're shopping with a fussy baby, it may be tempting to grab a can and run, but taking a few seconds to check the expiration date ensures safety and quality. If you buy in bulk, check the date every time you open a new can.If you have a newborn, you might want to wait a couple months to establish a feeding routine before stocking up. That way, you can figure out how much formula you'll be able to use before it expires.Also make sure the can isn't dented because this could mean the tin layer inside is cracked. This allows the liquid to come in contact with the steel, potentially causing rust and even a hole that could cause the contents to spoil.If you accidentally purchase expired formula, return the unopened container to the store and exchange it for a fresh one.Baby bottles and nipples buying guide (Before You Buy series) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 3:08Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -3:08Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosKeep formula cool but not frozenHeat and cold can degrade the nutrients in formula, so keep unopened liquid and powdered formula in a cool place. The optimum storage temperature is between 55 and 75 degrees Fahrenheit, but make certain that it stays below 95 degrees and above freezing, or 32 degrees.Choose a cabinet or a shelf located away from a stove, oven, heating ducts, or hot water pipes. Don't leave cans in direct sunlight, and don't put them in the freezer.After you open a can of liquid formula, follow the storage directions on the can. Most manufacturers recommend storing formula in the can, covered, for 24 to 48 hours.It's best not to put powdered formula in the refrigerator or another damp place because humidity can cause the powder to clump, which may overconcentrate the formula.Finish up a can of powdered formula within a month after opening it.Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.Use this five-step checklist for preparing formula1. Wash your equipment well.Scrubbing with a bottle or nipple brush and warm, soapy water then rinsing well kills most germs. Some experts suggest sanitizing all bottles, nipples, measuring cups, spoons, and rings. Others say there's no need unless water safety in your area is questionable. Still others advise sterilizing feeding supplies if your baby is younger than 3 months old.Ask your baby's doctor if you should sterilize new bottles and supplies before using them for the first time, and ask for her advice on the best way to clean your supplies going forward. Keep in mind that heat can release the harmful chemical bisphenol A (BPA) from certain types of plastic. If you use polycarbonate bottles or bottles marked with the recycling number 7 or ""PC,"" don't boil them or put them in the dishwasher or microwave. Better yet, if you can, replace your polycarbonate bottles with ones made of a different material, such as BPA-free plastic, glass, or stainless steel.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) considers bottles labeled ""BPA-free"" and bottles made of the plastics polyethylene and polypropylene to be safe for babies, but some studies suggest chemicals leach regardless of the type of plastic.If you're concerned, don't put plastic bottles of any type in boiling water, the dishwasher, microwave, or any device that uses heat because high temperatures can release more chemicals from the plastic. Hand-wash plastic bottles with warm, soapy water, and rinse well. Or use bottles made of glass or stainless steel, which are safe to put in the dishwasher.It's a good idea to wash bottle supplies right after each feeding so the formula doesn't have a chance to dry out and stick to the inside. Disassemble all bottle parts so the surface areas get cleaned well.If you choose to sanitize, simply place the supplies in boiling water for about five minutes. You can also use a commercial sterilizer. Alternatively, rinsing nipples with a mixture of half water, half vinegar can help prevent fungal growth.Let the bottles and supplies air dry on a drying rack, or use a paper towel if you need them dry right away. (Don't use dishtowels because they can harbor bacteria.)If you're using sample nipples that you were given at the hospital or doctor's office, they come in sterilized packages and can be used directly out of the package. But they're meant for single use, so throw them away after using them once.2. Wash and dry the top of the formula can before opening it.This removes dust and liquid that may have spilled on it. Use a clean can opener, and wash it well before every use.3. Wash your hands.Before preparing formula, wash your hands with soap and warm water for at least 20 seconds. Dry your hands with a paper towel.4. Follow the preparation directions on the container exactly.Mixing instructions vary by manufacturer, and the ratio of water to formula depends on whether the formula is powder or liquid, so read the label carefully.Adding too little water can tax your baby's kidneys and cause dehydration. Adding too much water dilutes the calories and nutrients in the formula and can cause stunted growth and failure to thrive if it happens regularly.For better accuracy, use a standard measuring cup instead of the lines on your baby's bottle.5. Use clean, safe water.If you're using powdered or liquid concentrate formula, be sure to mix it with water that's clean and safe. The AAP says it's fine to use tap water as long as your local health department says it's safe to drink. Run tap water for a minute or two until it's cold to reduce lead or other contaminants. If you have a private well, get the water tested before using it for your baby's formula.To sterilize water, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services recommends bringing water to a rolling boil for just one minute then letting it cool for no longer than 30 minutes before mixing with the formula. (Boiling water for an extended time can concentrate minerals and impurities.)Note that bottled water isn't necessarily sterile, and neither is water that's been run through a filter. Filters (in pitchers or on faucets) that aren't changed often enough can harbor bacteria. You can buy sterilized bottled water, but make sure the label specifies that.Also talk with your healthcare provider about the water quality in your area. Ask her whether she thinks it's necessary to boil the water for your baby's formula.Health experts say it's okay to use fluoridated water to prepare formula. But keep in mind that babies who drink formula mixed with fluoridated water are at greater risk of developing fluorosis. This condition doesn't affect dental health, but it can cause small white spots on your baby's teeth that are purely cosmetic. If you're concerned, talk to your baby's doctor or dentist.Mix what you can use within 24 hours and toss leftoversBased on how much formula your baby needs, mix only what you think you'll use in the next 24 hours. Once you've mixed powdered or liquid concentrate formula, refrigerate it immediately. Don't let it cool outside the refrigerator first, and use it within 24 hours.If your baby doesn't finish a bottle of formula within one hour, toss out the remainder. Bacteria from his mouth can seep into the bottle, contaminate the formula, and make your baby sick if he drinks it later.Tip: To prevent waste and save time, mix a large batch of formula in the morning and divide it into 3- or 4-ounce bottles that you can refrigerate and use throughout the day.Keep it coolRoom temperature is the perfect climate for breeding germs in formula, so feed warmed formula to your baby right away. Don't heat it up ahead of time, and toss any formula that has been sitting at room temperature for an hour or more.If you're taking your baby's bottle ""to go,"" store it in an insulated lunch pack, ideally with an ice pack. If that's not possible, bring a brand that's ready to use.Learn the symptoms of foodborne illnessThe most common symptoms of a foodborne illness are vomiting and diarrhea. If your baby has these symptoms, call his doctor right away. Foodborne illnesses can be very serious in babies, leading to dehydration, kidney damage, and, sometimes, even death.Report problems immediatelyOccasionally infant formula is recalled because of potential contamination, so it's a good idea to keep up with product recalls.If you have a complaint or concern about infant formula, especially if you suspect formula has made your baby sick, you can report the problem online to the FDA's MedWatch adverse event reporting program. Have the formula container handy so you can report essential information such as the manufacturer's name and the product's expiration date.Also notify the formula manufacturer about any problems. Look for a toll-free customer service number on the label.Show sources Hide sources AAP. Undated. Children and foodborne illness.

Choosing nipples and bottles for formula feeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_choosing-nipples-and-bottles-for-formula-feeding_14285.bc,"Ultimately your baby will decide which bottle you use. The first test is to see which nipple he'll take most easily. Once you determine that, you can select the bottles and bottle accessories you need.While shopping, keep in mind that you don't need to spend a fortune to safely bottle-feed your baby. The cost of these supplies adds up quickly, so keep it simple and buy just a few basic items at first. Carefully cleaning bottles and nipples and using formula safely are the best things you can do to ensure hygienic formula feeding.Choosing the right nipplesMaterial: You can choose silicone or latex nipples. Silicone nipples are firmer and hold their shape longer. Latex nipples are softer and more flexible but don't last as long. In extremely rare cases, babies can be allergic to latex.Shape: You have a choice in nipple shape  traditional, orthodontic, flat-topped, or ones with grooves and a shape that mimics a natural nipple. Orthodontic nipples are designed to accommodate your child's palate and gums, and this type has a flat bulb on the side that touches your child's tongue. Flat-topped nipples have a more realistic shape.Age range, size, and flow: Nipples are available in a range of sizes and flow speeds for babies at all stages of infancy.Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.If you're bottle-feeding a newborn, buy the smallest size in a variety of types, and let your baby determine which nipple he prefers.Special nipples are available for premature infants or babies with oral or facial problems that affect their ability to suck. These specialty nipples can help control or measure the rate of flow.Watch to make sure your baby isn't having a hard time getting milk or isn't getting so much that he's choking or spitting up. Don't alter a small nipple to increase its flow and, of course, discuss any feeding concerns with your baby's doctor.If you're weaning and switching to bottles, be sure to buy the right nipple for your child's age.When to replace nipples: Formula or breast milk should drip steadily out of the nipple. If it pours out in a stream, the hole is too big and the nipple should be replaced. Quickly check nipples before each use for signs of wear, such as discoloration or thinning, and replace worn ones, which could break and become a choking hazard.Bottom line: It may be a better value to buy nipples along with bottles in starter sets, but buy a variety of nipples at first because you can't know beforehand which type or size your child will prefer. Once you know your child's favorite, you can buy more to keep on hand for replacing as needed. Nipples cost about $2 to $4 each, though specialty nipples can run closer to $20.Choosing the right bottlesTwenty years ago, there was only one type of bottle. Now there are right-angled bottles that let less air into the nipple, streamlined bottles your baby can hold, and a variety of disposable bottles.Material: You can choose between plastic, glass, stainless steel, or a hybrid style that features a glass bottle inside a plastic or silicone sleeve.Plastic bottles are unbreakable but do deteriorate, so you need to replace them regularly. Glass bottles never need to be replaced as long as they don't break, chip, or crack. But they're heavier and may be harder for your baby to hold (once she's ready to hold her own bottle). Also, glass bottles could be dangerous if dropped or broken.The outer plastic or silicone sleeve of hybrid glass bottles may offer some protection against broken glass, but they cost more. Stainless steel bottles don't contain any plastic and are lighter than glass bottles. Age range and size: For newborns, buy five or six 4-ounce bottles to start. Switch to 8- or 9-ounce bottles at about 4 months (but save the smaller ones to have on hand as backups).The concern with plastic baby bottles: For decades, baby bottles were made from polycarbonate plastic, and tests indicated that a harmful chemical called bisphenol A (BPA) leaches from this type of plastic into baby formula. Evidence that BPA may be harmful if consumed led consumer and environmental groups to pressure manufacturers and the U.S. government to take steps to protect consumers.Today, American manufacturers of baby bottles no longer use BPA in their products. States have passed laws against the use of BPA in plastic bottles and sippy cups, and in 2012 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned the chemical in the production of baby bottles and sippy cups. Still, consumer and environmental advocates warn that plastic bottles are made with dozens of other potentially harmful chemical compounds and recommend that parents take certain preventive measures to protect their baby.Consider these precautions:Use glass, hybrid glass, or stainless steel bottles.If you'd rather use plastic bottles, look for the ""BPA-free"" label, or use opaque plastic bottles made from polyethylene or polypropylene marked with the recycling numbers 2 or 5.Avoid hand-me-down plastic bottles or bottles marked with the recycling number 7 or PC (for polycarbonate) because they may contain BPA. If you do use polycarbonate bottles, don't boil, microwave, or wash them in the dishwasher because heat releases BPA from the plastic.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) considers BPA-free bottles and bottles made of the plastics polyethylene or polypropylene to be safe for babies, but some studies suggest that chemicals may leach regardless of the type of plastic, especially if the bottle is heated. If you're concerned, don't put plastic bottles of any type in boiling water, the dishwasher, microwave, or any other device that uses heat because high temperatures can release chemicals from the plastic. For safe cleaning, use a bottle brush or nonabrasive sponge, scrub with warm, soapy water, and rinse well.Don't store formula in plastic bottles. Pour formula into the bottle just before your child drinks it, and discard any left over.Don't overheat plastic bottles with formula in them. To warm formula, put the bottle in a bowl of warm water, or run it under warm water.Discard scratched or worn plastic bottles, which may release small amounts of chemicals.Bottom line: Bottles range from about $1 to $20 each, with stainless steel and hybrid versions at the higher end. More expensive bottles may be angled or include special vacuum valves so your baby swallows less air. Bottle systems that use disposable liners typically cost between $10 and $20, with replacement liners costing between $7 to $10 for a pack of 100.Choosing bottle accessoriesModern accessories make it easier to take care of your baby's bottle-feeding supplies. At a minimum, you'll probably want a bottle drying rack and a couple of good brushes for cleaning bottles and nipples.Although the AAP is no longer as concerned about sterilizing bottles as in the past, it really depends on your situation. Your child's doctor may recommend sterilization, for example, because of an unsafe water supply. Ask her if she suggests boiling bottles and nipples or using a sterilization system.Insulated carrying bags keep bottles at the right temperature whether you're on the road or just heading to the park. You can even go all out and find appliances that will mix and heat the formula and pour it neatly into a bottle with the touch of a button (though they're pricey).Bottom line: Most accessories cost less than $20 (though some of the fancier bottle warmers or sterilizers can cost up to three times that) and can make it more convenient to store, warm, sterilize, and tote bottles.Learn more:Guide to firsts: Giving your baby a bottleBottle-feeding basicsHow to buy bottles and nipplesShow sources Hide sources FDA. 2016.

Bottle-feeding basics for formula-fed babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_bottle-feeding-basics-for-formula-fed-babies_14286.bc,"How often should I feed my baby?As with breastfeeding, most experts agree that you shouldn't follow a rigid schedule in the early weeks, though you may be able to work out an approximate pattern for feeding within a month or so. Offer a bottle every two to three hours at first, or as your baby seems hungry.When your baby is about a month old, she'll be ready to eat on a schedule. Formula-fed infants tend to be heavier than breastfed babies, so following a feeding schedule can help prevent them from overeating.Feed your baby once every three to four hours. Until she reaches about 10 pounds, she'll probably take 1.5 to 3 ounces per feeding. Don't force her to take more than she seems ready to eat. Your baby's doctor can advise you about how much your baby should eat as she grows.Do I need to sterilize the bottles?Doctors used to advise sterilizing bottle-feeding supplies back when the safety of water supplies was less reliable. This isn't as much of a concern now, but it's best to play it safe and ask your child's doctor if she thinks sterilization is necessary.If your doctor recommends sterilizing your supplies before the first use, submerge new bottles, nipples, and rings in a pot of boiling water for at least five minutes. Then let them air dry on a clean towel. After that, a good hand-washing with soapy water or a cycle through the dishwasher is sufficient. (You can find handy bottle gear  such as drying racks and dishwasher baskets for nipples, rings, and bottle caps  online or at baby supply stores.)Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.If you have well water, or if your local health department says your tap water is unsafe for drinking, you'll probably need to sterilize bottles before every use.A note about plastics: Some studies have found that plastic baby bottles contain chemicals which may leach into the formula, especially when the bottle is heated. You can avoid this risk by using bottles made of stainless steel or glass. If you decide to use plastic bottles, don't boil them, heat them in the microwave, or wash them in the dishwasher. Instead, hand wash them with a bottle brush and warm, soapy water. Learn more about the safety of plastic baby bottles.Do I need to sterilize my drinking water for making formula?Many parents do sterilize the water used to mix formula, especially in the newborn months, but you don't need to unless your child's doctor recommends it. However, if you use well water or your tap water is unsafe for drinking, you'll need to sterilize it or use bottled water for mixing formula.If you do choose to boil the water you use to mix formula, save yourself time by preparing enough in the morning for the whole day. Bring cold water to a rolling boil and let it boil for just one minute. Let it cool to room temperature for no longer than 30 minutes, mix enough formula for the next 24 hours, and refrigerate it immediately. Discard any formula that isn't used within 24 hours.What's the best way to warm a bottle?There's no health reason to warm formula, though your baby may prefer it. When you're ready to feed your baby, you can warm a bottle in a bowl of hot  not boiling  water, or by running it under the tap. You can also buy a bottle warmer designed for this purpose. Always test the formula by shaking a few drops on the inside of your wrist to make sure it's not too hot for your baby.If your baby is accustomed to drinking bottles at room temperature or slightly cold, you save yourself the time and hassle of preheating bottles, especially when she's crying to be fed right now.Caution: Never use a microwave to heat a bottle of formula. A microwave heats unevenly, so it can create hot pockets and lead to burns. Microwave heating can also cause the nutrients in formula to break down. Also, if you use plastic bottles, warm formula by putting the bottle in a bowl of warm  not hot  water or run it under warm water.For more bottle-feeding basics, visit these articles:Choosing nipples and bottles for formula feedingHow much formula your baby needsBreastfeeding and supplementing with formulaHow to use baby formula safelyShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

5 things you didn't know about formula feeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_5-things-you-didnt-know-about-formula-feeding_10357994.bc,"There's more to formula feeding than picking your favorite brand. From how it can affect your baby's poop to how much your baby will eat, we reveal a few surprises you may encounter when feeding your child.Formula-fed babies have different poopThe contents of your baby's diaper are directly affected by what you feed her. And not only are ""formula poops"" different, but they can also be a bit shocking  particularly for parents who switch over from breastfeeding.""Our baby went to formula at 5 weeks, and there was a drastic change in her poop,"" says one mom. ""The smell, texture, consistency, amount, color, and frequency all changed!""Why the difference? As pediatrician Margaret Morris explains, it's simply a matter of the body adapting to what it eats. ""The flora of the gastrointestinal tract changes depending on what kind of food is running through it  and formula is a different food from breast milk,"" she says.Many parents report that formula poop smells somewhat stronger, is darker in color, and is thicker than breast milk poop. If you want the nitty-gritty details, check out our poop slideshow (because when it comes to poop, a picture really is worth a thousand words).Babies don't digest breast milk and formula at the same rateCan formula-fed babies really go longer between feedings than breastfed babies? In a word, yes.Here's why: Breast milk and most formulas contain the proteins whey and casein. Breast milk contains more whey, which is easier to digest (and therefore babies digest it faster) than casein. Formula contains more casein, which babies digest more slowly.Before you get your hopes up for a good night's sleep, however, remember that every baby is different. Jatinder Bhatia, chief of neonatology at Georgia Health Sciences University and spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, explains that each baby has his own unique caloric needs, personality, and sleep patterns. As a result, some formula-fed babies feed  and wake  just as often as breastfed babies.""My older son was exclusively formula-fed, and he woke up on the identical schedule that my exclusively breastfed baby did,"" says one BabyCenter mom.Still, there's no doubt that formula takes longer to digest than breast milk. So if you seem to be feeding your baby a little less often than your breastfeeding friend feeds hers, don't worry.Your baby can be allergic to formulaMost babies easily digest formula with sunny smiles and a few contented burps. But some have an allergic reaction to the cow's milk protein in the formula, making for a less sunny experience.(Note: A milk protein intolerance is different than lactose intolerance, which doesn't develop until late childhood or early adolescence.)Your baby's bowel movements can serve as a major clue to how digestion is going, so if you're wondering whether your baby has a formula allergy, check things out down below. ""Blood or mucus in the stool usually means the bowels are inflamed, which is a sign of a possible allergy,"" says Morris.Other red flags include diarrhea, vomiting, fussiness around feedings, or a skin rash.Constant discomfort can also be a symptom. Of course, as any parent of a colicky baby will tell you, continuous crying doesn't always mean a formula allergy. Still, as Morris puts it, ""If a baby is persistently unhappy, there's probably a reason, and an allergy may very well be it. So it's important to check it out.""If your baby is allergic to milk-based formula, your doctor may recommend switching to one made from soy instead. If your baby is also allergic to soy protein, your doctor may recommend an extra-hydrolyzed formula, in which the protein has been broken down into a more digestible form.""My baby started to develop a major rash on his face and neck,"" one mom says. ""I brought him into the doctor and was instructed to switch to soy-based formula. Within 24 hours, his rash disappeared.""Different babies eat different amountsWhile trading stories of sleep deprivation and spit-up explosions with your mommy group, you notice your friend's baby slowly sipping on 3 ounces of formula. Before he's halfway done, your baby has wolfed down 7 ounces! Have you birthed a glutton?Nope. It's nothing more than a classic case of individual difference, says Morris. ""Formula portions are not one size fits all,"" she explains. ""Some babies need more calories than others, and what is sufficient for one child's growth may not be sufficient for another's.""In addition, your child's formula intake will vary from meal to meal  just as you may want a light salad for lunch but crave a more substantial dinner. ""Don't be shocked if your baby takes 4 ounces at one feeding and 6 ounces at the next,"" says Morris. Let your baby's cues guide you.Despite the variability, however, it's still important to follow some basic guidelines. Generally speaking, babies who are not yet on solids should get about 2.5 ounces of formula per pound of body weight in every 24-hour period. So if your baby weighs 6 pounds, you'll give her about 15 ounces of formula. If she weighs 10 pounds, she should drink about 25 ounces a day.And don't forget to schedule regular visits with your baby's doctor to track her growth and ensure that everything is in order.Most formula is basically the sameIt's easy to feel overwhelmed by the sheer variety of formulas on the grocery store shelf. How do you choose the best one? Many parents are relieved to hear that when it comes to the most important nutrients, all formulas are created equal.This is because formula is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which requires manufacturers to include 29 specific nutrients in each serving. While different brands have different names, packaging, and prices, none of them will short-change you on the required ingredients.One ingredient that's not in all formulas is the fatty acid DHA, which some studies have shown can improve cognition and visual processing. It's included in many formulas these days, but not all, so you may want to look for a brand that includes it.There are, however, many specialized formulas for specific situations. Formulas designed for premature and low-birth-weight babies, for example, contain more calories than the standard types. Formulas for babies with reflux have rice or other thickeners added to it. There are also soy or hydrolyzed formulas for infants with potential allergies or milk protein intolerance.Parents who prefer to go the organic route can find formulas made with organic ingredients. Organic formulas are subject to the same FDA regulations as other formulas. In addition, they must be certified as organic by the U.S. Department of Agriculture.Still feeling undecided? Your child's doctor can help you choose the formula that best fits your baby's needs. You can also compare notes with other parents in our formula-feeding community group.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a. Choosing a formula.

"My breastfeeding story: Needed formula at first, then phased it out",https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-needed-formula-at-first-then-phased-i_10419222.bc,"Name: SheridanLives in: Swansea, MassachusettsBreastfeeding experience: Caught off-guard by difficulties, but persisted and felt proud of what she accomplishedMain challenges: Preemie baby; had to rely on formula for a whileBreastfed for: 14 monthsMy storyI work at a hospital that actively promotes breastfeeding. As part of my job as a licensed dietitian, I read a 300-page manual on breastfeeding practices. So I thought I had it all figured out well before I had my son. Then Cameron was born a month early and transferred to the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). Everything I thought I knew went out the window.The first sign things would go differently for us was after Cameron was handed over for skin-to-skin contact to initiate breastfeeding. He showed absolutely no interest. He didn't even search for the breast.I knew nursing doesn't always happen right away. What worried me was that he wasn't breathing all that well either. That's when the doctors took him to the NICU. They checked his breathing, tested his blood sugar, took his temperature, and put him under a heat lamp while I rested.About nine hours later I met with a lactation consultant and learned how to use the pump so I could feed Cameron my breast milk from a bottle, which they said might be easier for him. I reviewed the pumping process again with another expert when I visited him in the NICU. Both suggested I use a nipple shield, which can make it easier for preemies to latch on. We tried it and he latched on but had to work pretty hard to get anything. Apparently, this is often the case with babies who have respiratory issues. In hindsight I think the shield just made it harder for him.After three days in the NICU, we left the hospital. He still had trouble nursing so I was feeding him the colostrum I was able to pump and supplementing it with formula.It wasn't easy being home on my own. The word that comes to mind when I think of nursing him then? Combative. While trying to latch onto me, his arms flailed and he sometimes scratched me. After 10 to 15 minutes of this, my husband would take him and feed him formula while I pumped milk, which I'd then give him in a bottle. I basically just felt like, whatever it takes, let's make sure he's fed.When he was a month old I finally just quit the nipple shield to see what would happen  and he latched! It took a couple of days, but I couldn't believe I'd kept up pumping for an entire month and now there was an end in sight!Still it took time for me to feel confident that he didn't also need formula. I'd nurse him and, if he still cried, I'd top off a feeding with 2 or 3 ounces of formula. Eventually I learned to trust what my body was doing and, over time, decreased the amount of formula he was getting. By month three he was exclusively on breast milk.I went back to work after 15 weeks and pumped two to three times a day during work hours. In the hospital I have the luxury of a pump room with hospital-grade pumps, lounge chairs, and a window view.When Cameron was 12 months old, he was eating table food and I finally stopped pumping at work. I tried to continue breastfeeding at night but he didn't really show interest. He'd latch and then unlatch after a few minutes. By 14 months, he had weaned himself.My biggest lesson learnedBe confident that your body really can do the job. Breastfeeding was the hardest thing I've ever done but I feel like I rocked it. It was so rewarding when he finally latched on.Back to all breastfeeding essays"

That comes in handy when you can't be with your baby at feeding time or you're somewhere that you can't easily or comfortably breastfeed. You can store pumped breast milk at room temperature (no more than 77 degrees Fahrenheit, 25 degrees Celsius) for up to four hours, in a cooler with refreezable ice packs for up to 24 hours, and in a refrigerator for up to 72 hours (three days). To heat it, just put the bottle in a container of warm water for a few minutes or use a portable bottle warmer. It's also fine to give breast milk to your baby cold if he'll take it that way.A car adapter for a breast pump. The most effective breast pumps are electric. If you're traveling by car and won't have access to electricity, you can buy an adapter that allows you to plug your pump into the car. (You can also use a manual pump, but they're not as efficient as the electric ones.)Inflatable breastfeeding pillow. If you need pillow support, look for an inflatable breastfeeding pillow that tucks into your diaper bag. It will position your baby correctly and reduce strain on your back and arms so you can nurse comfortably wherever you go.Parent tip: ""I wear a tank top under my shirt. When I lift my shirt to breastfeed, the tank top keeps my belly covered and everything more modest. I love my battery-powered pump! Easier than a manual pump and more convenient than one you have to plug in. Traveling is when I'm most thankful that I decided to breastfeed, because it's so convenient!""Tip: For more discreet breastfeeding in public, wear a blouse that buttons down the front and unbutton it from the bottom so your breasts stay covered. Formula-feeding away from homeBottle-feeding is very convenient  until you're away from your own kitchen. Then scooping, mixing, and pouring may start to seem pretty complicated, especially if your baby is fussing.What helps:Canned, ready-to-feed formula. Canned, ready-to-feed formula is the easiest solution  and the most expensive one. It costs considerably more than powdered or concentrated liquid formula, so many people save it for emergencies. Consider buying a brand sold in cans that are free of the chemical bisphenol A (BPA).Powdered formula dispenser. Use a divided plastic container to carry premeasured amounts of formula. Then simply pour the powder into a bottle, add water, and serve.Individual packets of powdered formula. While a bit more expensive than cans of powder or liquid concentrate, these premeasured packets are very handy, especially if you're traveling by plane and don't want to lug a can of formula in your diaper bag.Knowing how to safely carry formula with you. If you choose the more economical route of mixing your own formula, be sure to safely prepare and store it: A prepared bottle keeps at room temperature without spoiling for about one hour. If you won't use it within an hour, keep it in an insulated cooler with ice packs until you're ready to serve. To be safe, many experts recommend boiling the water you use for formula until your baby is around 4 to 6 months old, when his immune system starts to provide more protection against infection  so you may need to bring water with you. Throw away any formula that's still in the bottle one hour after your baby started feeding. Once your child's mouth has touched the bottle, the contents can become contaminated with bacteria.A bottle cooler/warmer. With a portable cooler/warmer, you can keep a bottle cool and then warm it up when you need it. Some run on batteries. Others have car battery adapters (and can also be used at home).Hot and cool gel packs. Gel packs that can be frozen solid or heated in the microwave help keep your baby's bottles cold until ready to serve and can also be used to heat the bottle for serving.Tip: If your baby prefers formula warm, take a thermos of warm water with you. Just heat the water to the desired temperature at home, pour it into a thermos, and scoop the right amount of formula into individual bottles. Mix the bottles when you're ready to feed. Feeding solids on the goStarting at about age 4 to 6 months, your child will probably start eating solid food. Get ready to add soft spoons, dishes, bibs, and more to your already bulging diaper bag.What helps: Plastic-coated bibs. These bibs can be wiped clean with a wipe or napkin and machine-washed when you get home.Portable placemats. Portable placemats that you can lay down on restaurant tables or highchair trays give you the peace of mind of knowing that your baby's eating off of a clean surface. The reusable mats made of plastic are handy because they don't slip.Mini-food dicer. Tired of cutting your baby's food into bite-size pieces? A food dicer does the job quickly for you and is small enough to fit in your diaper bag. Just drop the fruits, vegetables, meat, or poultry that you want to feed your baby into the dicer, press a few times, and the meal is ready to serve, safely.Knowing the safety rules of baby food. If you're offering food from a jar or container, don't dip the spoon back into the food after it's touched your child's mouth unless you're sure he'll eat it all (or you don't want to save what's left). The spoon will contaminate the remaining food with bacteria. Instead, use a clean spoon to scoop a small amount of food into a bowl and serve from there. Once a jar of commercial baby food has been opened, it will keep  refrigerated  for 24 to 48 hours (read the jar's label for specifics: Fruits keep longer than meats). If you don't have access to a refrigerator, sandwich any leftovers in ice packs in an insulated cooler. When in doubt, throw it out. It's better not to risk serving contaminated food.Clip-on seat or self-inflating booster. Helpful whether you're dining in a restaurant or at a friend's house, these seats attach to virtually any table, or even a picnic bench. A self-inflating booster is compact enough to fit in most diaper bags or backpacks.Snack cups. Fill a couple of plastic cups with fitted tops with snacks appropriate for your child's age: baby cereal (add breast milk, formula, or water when you're ready to feed), toasted O's cereal, teething biscuits, mandarin oranges, peeled and sliced grapes. These containers keep food from spilling or getting crushed, and they make great serving bowls, too.Mini-insulated tote bag. A small cooler bag with ice packs keeps formula, juice, yogurt, cheese, and other perishable food fresh until you need it. If your baby is still eating just a few things, it will make your life easier if you keep them on hand and then ""supplement"" with appropriate foods available wherever you happen to be eating.Portable mini-fridge. For longer outings such as road trips, a portable refrigerator with a car adapter (which can also be plugged into a standard electric outlet) keeps food, snacks, breast milk, and prepared formula cool.Parent tip: ""I use the restaurant utensils, placemats, and chair provided by the restaurant. I mash the food with my fingers, a fork, or a baby food mill."""
Constipation in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_constipation-in-babies_79.bc,"How can I tell if my baby is constipated?First, consider what's normal for your baby. She may have a bowel movement after every feeding, or she may wait a day or more in between. Your baby's individual pattern depends on what she eats and drinks, how active she is, and how quickly she digests food.If your baby drinks formula or eats solid food, she'll probably have a regular bowel movement at least once a day. If your baby is breastfed, there's no ""normal"" number or schedule  only what's typical for your baby. It's not unheard of for breastfed babies to have one bowel movement a week.After a while, you'll be tuned in to your baby's unique habits. If you're concerned that your baby may be constipated, watch for these signs:Less frequent bowel movements than usual, especially if your baby hasn't had one for three or more days and is obviously uncomfortable when she doesHard, dry stools that are difficult for her to pass  no matter how frequentlyBaby massage: Helping digestion Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:35Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:35Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Get step-by-step instructions with our easy-to-follow baby-massage video. See all baby videosWhy is my baby getting constipated?There are several possible causes:Solid food. Don't be surprised if your baby becomes mildly constipated as he eats more solid food. That's often because rice cereal  a common first food  is low in fiber. Constipation can also happen when you wean your baby from breast milk because this sometimes leads to dehydration.Formula. Babies who breastfeed exclusively are rarely constipated. Breast milk has the perfect balance of fat and protein, so it produces stools that are almost always soft  even if your baby hasn't had one for several days.If your baby is on formula, it's possible that something in his formula is making him constipated. It's not uncommon for the protein component in different formulas to cause constipation. Ask your baby's doctor about switching brands.(Despite what you may have heard, the amount of iron in formula doesn't cause constipation.)Dehydration. If your baby becomes dehydrated, his system will respond by absorbing more fluid from whatever he eats or drinks  and also from the waste in his bowels. The result is hard, dry stools that are difficult to pass.Illness or a medical condition. Although it's uncommon, constipation can be caused by an underlying medical condition such as hypothyroidism, botulism, and certain food allergies and metabolic disorders. Rarely, constipation is caused by Hirschsprung's disease, a condition caused by a birth defect that prevents a baby's gut from functioning properly.If there doesn't seem to be a reason why your baby passes hard, painful stools, have his doctor rule out these conditions.How can I treat my baby's constipation?Here are some things to try:Help her get some exercise. If your baby's a crawler, encourage her to do a few laps. If she's not crawling yet, try pumping her legs instead. While she's lying on her back, gently move her legs in a forward, circular motion as if she were pedaling a bicycle.Massage your baby's belly. Measure three finger-widths below her navel on the lower left side and apply gentle but firm pressure there with your fingertips. Press until you feel a firmness or mass. Maintain gentle but constant pressure for about three minutes.If you feed your baby formula, ask her doctor about switching to a different brand. Sometimes adding dark corn syrup to the formula also does the trick: Start with 1/4 teaspoon per 4 ounces of formula. If that doesn't help, gradually increase the amount. Don't give her more than 1 teaspoon per 4 ounces.Add a little prune juice to formula or breast milk if your baby is at least 4 weeks old. Normally, it isn't necessary to give your baby juice, but a little is okay to help relieve constipation. (Try apple or pear juice if your baby doesn't like the taste of prunes.) Give her an ounce a day for each month of life, up to 4 ounces for a 4-month-old. After 8 months, your baby can have as much as 6 ounces of juice a day to treat constipation.If your baby is old enough to eat a variety of solid foods, cut down on constipating foods like rice, bananas, and cooked carrots. Try giving her a few tablespoons of pureed prunes, apricots, or pears to help loosen her bowel movements. For the best result, give your baby a belly massage first, then some high fiber food.Talk to your baby's doctor about other treatment options. Ask about using an over-the-counter stool softener to make it more comfortable for your baby to have a bowel movement, but never give her a laxative without her doctor's approval. The doctor may also suggest you try a glycerin suppository if your baby is severely constipated. The suppository stimulates your baby's rectum and helps her pass a stool. Using a suppository occasionally is fine, but don't do it on a regular basis because your baby could wind up relying on them to have a bowel movement.If your baby is passing such hard, dry stools that you see a little blood or even slight tears (fissures) in the delicate skin near the opening of her anus, you can apply some aloe vera lotion to the area to help it heal. Keep the area as clean and dry as possible, and mention the fissures to your baby's doctor.When should I call the doctor?Call the doctor if your baby isn't eating, loses weight, or has blood in his stool. Or if basic treatments, such as adjusting his diet, aren't helping his condition. And if he's younger than 4 months old, call his doctor if he has very hard stools or hasn't had a bowel movement within 24 hours of when he usually goes. Don't give your baby a laxative or suppository without consulting his doctor first.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2013a. Infant constipation.

Why babies spit up,https://www.babycenter.com/0_why-babies-spit-up_1765.bc,"Why does my baby spit up so much?He's probably just getting the hang of feeding. And he's not alone: Almost half of young babies spit up regularly. The peak age for spitting up  also known as reflux  is 4 months.When your baby swallows air along with his breast milk or formula, the air gets trapped in with the liquid. The air has to come up, and when it does, some of the liquid comes up too, through his mouth or nose.Babies take in a lot of nourishment in relation to their size, and some of them really like to eat, so sometimes they become overfilled and, well, overflow.A newborn's digestive system isn't fully developed, either. The muscles at the bottom of your baby's esophagus, which control whether food is coming or going, may still be getting up to speed. It's no wonder your baby creates so much laundry.Is there anything I can do about it?Try these tips to help your baby keep his food down:Hold your baby in a fairly upright position when you feed him. Feeding him while he's slouched (curled up in your arms or sitting in a car seat, for example) doesn't give the formula or breast milk a straight path to his tummy.Keep feedings calm. Minimize noise and other distractions, and try not to let your baby get too hungry before you start feeding him. If he's distracted or frantic, he's more likely to swallow air along with his breast milk or formula.If your baby's drinking formula or pumped breast milk from a bottle, make sure the hole in the nipple isn't too small, which will frustrate your baby and make him swallow air. On the other hand, if the hole's too large, he'll be gagging and gulping because the fluid will come at him too quickly. Read our advice on choosing nipples and bottles.Burp your baby after each feeding. In fact, if your baby takes a natural pause during a feeding, take the opportunity to burp him before giving him more food. That way, if there's any air, it'll come up before even more food is layered on top of it. (Don't forget to put a soft cloth on your shoulder first!)If you don't get a burp up within a few minutes, don't worry. Your baby probably doesn't need to burp just then.Keep the pressure off his tummy. Make sure your baby's clothing and diaper aren't too tight, and don't put his tummy over your shoulder when you burp him. Try to avoid car trips right after feedings, because reclining in a car seat can put pressure on your baby's stomach, too.Don't jostle your baby too much after he eats, and try to keep him in an upright position for half an hour or so. This way he'll have gravity on his side. You can carry him, put him in a pack, or prop him next to you against some pillows if he's big enough.Don't overfeed him. If your baby seems to spit up quite a bit after every feeding, he may be getting too much to eat. You might try to give him just a bit less formula or breastfeed him for a slightly shorter time, and see whether he's satisfied. (He may be willing to take less formula or breast milk at a feeding but want to eat more frequently.)If you're breastfeeding, ask your doctor if there's something in your diet that may be making your baby spit up more (sometimes cow's milk is the culprit).If your baby tends to spit up while sleeping, elevate his head. It's unsafe for your baby to sleep with a pillow, but you can place a foam wedge under one end of his mattress or put the head of his crib safely on blocks.Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.When will my baby stop spitting up?As your baby's muscles develop and get stronger, your baby will be able to keep food in his belly. Most babies stop spitting up by around 6 or 7 months of age, or once they learn to sit up on their own, but a few will continue until their first birthday.How can I tell if he's spitting up or vomiting?Vomiting is usually more forceful and of greater quantity than if your baby is just spitting up some of his latest meal. If your baby seems distressed, he's probably vomiting. Spitting up doesn't faze most babies at all.Is spitting up ever a sign of something serious?Spitting up is usually just par for the parenting course, but if your baby isn't gaining weight as he should be, schedule a visit with his doctor. Babies who spit up so much that they don't gain enough weight or have difficulty breathing may have gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD.Call your doctor immediately if your baby begins projectile vomiting. Projectile vomiting is when the vomit flies out of a baby's mouth forcefully  shooting across the room, for example. This could be a sign of a condition called pyloric stenosis, in which the muscles at the bottom of the stomach thicken and prevent the flow of food to the small intestine. This typically happens at about 1 month of age.Also phone your doctor right away if you see green bile in your baby's vomit. This could be a sign of a blockage in your baby's intestines, which would require a visit to the emergency room, a scan, and possibly emergency surgery.

Bottle-feeding basics,https://www.babycenter.com/0_bottle-feeding-basics_752.bc,"How often should I feed my baby?Most experts agree that you shouldn't follow a rigid feeding schedule in the early weeks, though you may be able to work out an approximate pattern within a month or two.Offer your breast or the bottle every two to three hours at first or as your baby seems hungry. Until your baby reaches about 10 pounds, she'll probably take one to three ounces per feeding.Don't force more than she seems ready to eat.

See all videosDo I need to sterilize the bottles?Before you first use new bottles, nipples, and rings, sterilize them by submerging them in a pot of boiling water for at least five minutes. Then let them air dry on a clean towel. After that, a good cleaning in hot, soapy water or a cycle through the dishwasher is sufficient.Two exceptions: One, if you have well water, it may be best to continue sterilizing the bottles. And two, to minimize exposure to harmful chemicals, don't boil plastic baby bottles, heat them in the microwave, or wash them in the dishwasher.Plastic bottles are made with bisphenol A and other chemicals that are released when heated. When these chemicals are released, they may end up in your baby's milk or formula.You can find handy bottle-feeding gear, such as bottle drying racks and dishwasher baskets for nipples, rings, and bottle caps, at most baby supply stores.Find out how to choose bottles and nipples and when to replace them.Guide to Firsts: Bottle feeding7 keys to feeding your baby with a bottle.Can I mix breast milk and formula?There's nothing wrong with mixing breast milk and formula in the same container, but it's not recommended simply because you don't want to waste a single drop of your precious breast milk if you're pumping and supplementing with formula. A good plan is to feed your baby whatever breast milk you've expressed, and then follow that up with an ounce or two of formula if you need it. Find out more.What's the best way to warm a bottle?There's no health reason to warm the milk first, but your baby may prefer it. When you're ready to feed your baby, you can heat up the bottle in a bowl of warm  not hot or boiling  water, or by running it under the tap. You can also buy a bottle warmer designed for this purpose.If your baby is accustomed to drinking bottles at room temperature or slightly cold, you save yourself the time and hassle of preheating bottles, especially when she's crying to be fed.Never use a microwave to heat a bottle of breast milk or formula. A microwave oven heats unevenly, so it can create hot pockets and lead to burns. It can also cause nutrients to break down.How can I make sure my baby is drinking comfortably?Like so much with babies, you'll need to listen and observe. If you hear a lot of noisy sucking sounds while she drinks, she may be taking in too much air. To help your baby swallow less air, hold her at a 45-degree angle. Also take care to tilt the bottle so that the nipple and neck are always filled with breast milk or formula.Never prop a bottle - it can cause your baby to choke. Besides, bottle-feeding, like breastfeeding, can be a wonderful time for nurturing your baby by holding her close. So take feeding time as an opportunity to snuggle and bond.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2011a. Amount and schedule of formula feedings.

Can you really protect your child from allergies?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_can-you-really-protect-your-child-from-allergies_1422161.bc,"The numbers are striking: 20 to 40 percent of children in the United States have at least one allergy, according a report from the World Allergy Organization. At a time when so many kids are suffering, parents and researchers alike are looking for answers. How do allergies and asthma get their start? Is there really any way to keep them from happening? How to allergy-proof your homeLearn easy steps for reducing dust, pet dander, and other allergens at home.Infancy: When sensitivities are bornMost allergies develop during the first year or two of life. And if you or your partner has allergies, your baby is more likely to develop allergies too. But if you can keep her away from the most highly allergenic substances while her immune system has a chance to mature, you just might help her avoid allergies entirely.Feeding your infant nothing but breast milk for the first six months of life is the most effective weapon against allergies. For one thing, breast milk promotes a healthy immune system. And unlike cow's milk or many types of formula, breast milk doesn't contain proteins that can easily trigger an allergic reaction.Nursing moms may worry that they'll pass along their own food allergies to their baby through breast milk, but this is highly unlikely. According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), it's very rare for a baby to have an allergic reaction to breast milk  it's usually a reaction to cow's milk in the mother's diet. In these rare cases, your baby's reactions would be obvious  severe colic, stomach pain, skin rash, vomiting or diarrhea, or difficulty breathing. If your baby has any of these signs, call her doctor right away.If anyone in your family has severe food allergies, the AAP says you might want to limit your intake of dairy products, fish, eggs, peanuts, and other nuts while you're breastfeeding, just to be on the safe side. But for the most part, there's no evidence that your diet affects your child's chances of developing allergies or asthma. If your baby seems fussy when you breastfeed after eating certain foods, simply try avoiding that food for a while. If your baby is at high risk for allergies and you can't breastfeed her, try hypoallergenic formulas. (The label should include the words ""extensively hydrolyzed."") A hydrolyzed formula is one in which the protein in milk has been broken down into tiny fragments. Proteins can trigger allergies, so breaking them down may prevent reactions.The AAP doesn't recommend using soy formulas as a way to prevent allergies in babies who are at a high risk for allergies. Soy formulas can cause allergic reactions in susceptible infants, and they haven't been shown to reduce allergies later in life.Instead, consider trying a formula that contains probiotics or prebiotics. Prebiotics promote the growth of probiotics in the digestive system. Some research suggests that prebiotics and probiotics may reduce allergies, but studies have shown mixed results. Check with your baby's doctor before giving this a try.It was once thought unwise to give your baby allergenic foods  such as eggs and fish  in the first year, but this is no longer the case. The AAP says it's fine to give your baby these foods at 4 to 6 months as long as you introduce them one at a time and wait at least two or three days before trying another one.However, if your baby has a history of food allergies or has eczema that isn't responding to treatment, check with her doctor before trying any allergenic foods.Toddling toward an allergyEven if your child makes it through his first year without signs of an allergy, you'll still want to keep an eye out. His immune system isn't completely mature, and it still has a chance to make a wrong turn.One way to protect your baby is to protect his air. Above all else, he shouldn't have to breathe cigarette smoke. Secondhand smoke irritates the lungs and makes babies vulnerable to serious health problems, from asthma to sudden infant death syndrome.If your toddler's at high risk for allergies or already has allergies, check out these ways to allergy-proof your home.Older kids: Not out of the woods yetBy the time your child reaches grade school, her immune system is almost completely mature. And even if she doesn't seem allergic to anything, that doesn't mean she'll never develop any.If allergies run in your family, it still makes sense to protect your child  even if she's made it this far without so much as a sniffle  by doing what you can to allergy-proof your house and be alert for reactions to new foods.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012.

My breastfeeding story: Forced to quit after a medical crisis,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-forced-to-quit-after-a-medical-crisis_10414439.bc,"Name: AmberLives in: Marion, IndianaBreastfeeding experience: Unexpectedly difficultMain challenges: Preemie delivery, low supply, and postpartum complicationsBreastfed for: 3 monthsMy storyI had twins at age 27 and was dead set on breastfeeding. I had to be induced at 35 weeks because I was preeclamptic, and they were born at 3 pounds, 3 ounces  tiny but perfectly healthy.I, on the other hand, wasn't doing so well. My placenta had grown through my uterus, and I needed three surgeries and 20 units of blood. The doctors told me I wouldn't be breastfeeding because my body was in a state of shock and couldn't produce milk. I prayed and prayed, and I did produce some.I had to pump since my babies were too young to nurse. At first I was only getting an ounce at the most, and it took several weeks to make more. My twins were fed my breast milk through a tube, and the nurses added fortifiers to give them more calories and nutrients. When that still wasn't enough, we had to supplement with formula.They ate every three hours, so I pumped every three hours. It was so much work. I wasn't producing as much milk as I wanted to, partly because they were too frail to nurse (the doctors didn't want them to expend energy nursing and lose weight) and without them nursing, my body wasn't properly stimulated to make more milk. I was heartbroken about having to supplement with formula, but I wanted them to survive and I wanted them to come home, so we did what we had to.Finally, 6 weeks later, I was able to nurse my babies. It was like winning a race! But even after nursing, I could tell they were still hungry. I felt very defeated. So the doctors said for me to supplement with formula after each feeding and to keep trying. They were so encouraging!But then they discovered that I still had remnants of my placenta in my uterus. That was hindering milk production since my body was getting signals that I was still pregnant. So they wanted to do another surgery, but they couldn't operate. I had lost 20 units of blood during my delivery, and my body was in such a fragile state  I wasn't medically stable yet. I was put on medication that would filter into my breast milk, and we didn't want the babies to get it, so I had to stop breastfeeding. We switched to formula.I was devastated. It sent me into a horrible postpartum depression. I felt like my body failed me and failed my babies. I wasn't ready to let go.I was put on antidepressants, and I joined a support group for moms. Many of the moms in the group had twins, and hearing other women talk about how it didn't go their way either made me feel more normal. It helped me let go of feeling like a failure, and the formula nourished them. They couldn't take regular formula; they had to get a specially formulated one, so I knew they were getting just what they needed.Because of the scar tissue that formed in my uterus, I was told I'd probably never get pregnant again. But when the twins were 2, I had another child! I breastfed my daughter for 20 months, and I thank God for that experience because it gave me closure on what happened with the twins. I realized that my body didn't fail me  it's just what happened.My biggest lesson learnedIf I could tell myself any advice from the beginning, it's to not have a picture in my mind of what breastfeeding should look like. And if it doesn't work out, there's always a plan B. Plan B is still beautiful. You can still bond with your baby with a bottle.Back to all breastfeeding essays"
How you'll feed your premature baby in the NICU,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-youll-feed-your-premature-baby-in-the-nicu_10300014.bc,"Before your baby was born, you probably dreamed aboutwhat it would be like to hold and feed him. Perhaps you had already decided to feed your baby breast milk or formula.But now that your baby is in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), you may need to adjust your plans. Because feeding is so central to nurturing your baby, these decisions are likely to be loaded with emotion for you.Use whatever combination of breast milk and formula, bottle feeding and nursing works best for you and your baby.BreastfeedingBreast milk providesmany wonderful and vital health benefitsfor all newborns, especially premature or sickbabies. But many NICU babies aren't ready to feed from the breast at first.Moms can learn topump breast milkso it can be delivered to your baby's stomach through a tube. If your baby can't suckle, tube feeding is the best way for him to get your breast milk.You may feel sad and disappointed to substitute an electric pump for a warm, hungry baby. This may not be what you planned. And yet providing breast milk for your baby may help soothe your sorrow over his hospitalization.Breast milk is something truly special and beneficial that you can give your baby. And when your baby is ready to suckle, you can start putting him to your breast. Here are some ideas for meeting the challenges of breastfeeding your baby in the NICU:Discuss your desire to breastfeed with your baby's medical team.Ask for referrals to the NICU's lactation consultant and to other NICU mothers who are successfully pumping milk or breastfeeding their babies.Start pumping as soon as you can.Usethe pump that best works for you. Try a hospital-quality electric pump in good working order.Establish a relaxing ritualso that you condition your breasts to ""let down"" (release milk) when it's time to pump or feed.If you're establishing your milk supply or want to build it up,pump every 2 to 2 1/2 hours around the clock for a couple of days and nights (or eight to 12 times during the day if sleeping at night is paramount). After your milk supply is established, go no more than about eight hours at night, and then pump at least eight times throughout the day.When you pump, be sure to empty your breaststo extract the hind milk, which is highest inthe fat calories your baby needs. Pump for a minute or two after the milk flow stops or comes out in slow drips.Persist through the ups and downsof your milk supply. Expect very small amounts at first. At any time, if your breasts seem unproductive in spite of pumping, you may be tempted to give up. But try to keep going so your breasts stay primed. Try getting more rest, drinking more water, and pumping more frequently (rather than for longer sessions). Your milk supply may build up naturally as you reduce the stress in your body.If your baby is able to suckle, he'll be more receptive to feeding when he's alert and quiet.Ask to feed him in a quiet, darkened room so he doesn't become distracted. Start by doingkangaroo care, or holding your diapered baby against your bare chest. Kangaroo care will relax both of you, and the skin-to-skin contact may inspire him to suck and start your milk flowing. When he starts rooting around on your skin, guide him to your nipple.Recognize that every mother has to figure out what works best.For instance, if your baby has trouble latching on to your nipple, try using your pump's suction to draw out your nipple before putting your baby to the breast. Or if your milk spurts out at the beginning of the feeding and overwhelms your baby, pump just enough beforehand to reduce the pressure or volume. That way, your baby can keep up without swallowing air or choking. Try to find solutions that work for both of you.View the entire feeding relationship as meaningful for you and your baby.If you choose to supply a small amount of milk, or if you want to put your baby to the breast even if you supplement with a bottle afterward, do so. Give yourself room to experiment and adjust.See BabyCenter's information onbreastfeeding your premature babyandpumping your breast milk.Formula feedingBabies thrive with formula feeding, too. There are a number of formula options, and the NICU team will recommend one for your baby. See BabyCenter's information onformula feeding.If you wanted to breastfeed but then decided not to or are forced to give it up,you may feel disappointed. Remember that you can have a close and rewarding relationship with your bottle-fed baby, too.You can experience the closeness of breastfeeding by cuddling your baby against your warm skin and letting your baby observe your face. You can also continue to dokangaroo carefor many months.You may need to wait a while before you feed your baby from a bottle. If he is very premature or ill, he may first need to get formula from a thin tube that's inserted into his stomach through his nose or mouth (gavage feeding). Your baby's nurse can show you how to feed your baby this way, so you can take on the important role of providing nourishment.

My breastfeeding story: Working around my baby's food allergies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-working-around-my-babys-food-allergie_10419223.bc,"Name: TorieLives in: Wallington, New JerseyBreastfeeding experience: Difficult but rewardingMain challenges: Her son's extreme sensitivity to her dietBreastfed for: 20 monthsMy storyWhen I started breastfeeding my son, Cameron, I was focused on how painful it was for me. My nipples were cracked and bleeding, which made me dread nursing. Eventually my nipples healed  and that's about the time I noticed Cameron becoming a little cranky.Everyone I spoke to about it told me that all babies go through this. But in the back of my mind I thought it might be food-related since my sister had had to cut out dairy and soy when she was nursing.Then, when Cameron was about 3 weeks old, I noticed a spot of blood in his stool. I went to the doctor that day, and Cameron had a poopy diaper right there. They tested it and found more blood, so my doctor suggested I cut out dairy and soy since they were the most likely irritants. But seeing that blood scared me and I decided to cut out other potential irritants as well, like chocolate, caffeine, citrus, fruit, and broccoli.It wasn't easy, but I was committed to nursing. Since I had already cut out so much food during pregnancy, it really wasn't a big deal for me. Plus I knew I could always add foods back.Cameron was okay, but I noticed he was still cranky, and when he ate he looked like he was in pain. He also occasionally still had blood in his stool.When he was about 6 or 7 weeks old, I celebrated my birthday and overindulged on things like meat and nuts. The next day Cameron was beside himself. He screamed and cried and was so upset I decided to cut out the other top allergens as well: gluten, peanuts, tree nuts, corn, fish, and shellfish.His personality did a 180. Within a day or two he became the happiest baby. He also started meeting and even exceeding all his milestones. Still, the blood in his stools continued.We went to a gastroenterologist who told us it was allergies. So I took him to a pediatric allergist who did a skin prick test for eggs and dairy. It came out negative. The doctor thought the problem was an immature digestive system and told me I could put Cameron on formula or keep doing what I was doing.I wanted to continue breastfeeding.So my husband and I did more research and decided to try a total elimination diet where you eat only five to seven things and use that as a baseline for identifying foods you're sensitive to. Dr. William Sears, who recommends an elimination diet in instances like mine, suggests sticking to turkey, lamb, pears, millet, potatoes, rice, and squash. I altered the lineup slightly and ended up with chicken, quinoa, millet, pears, squash, and olive oil.I was on that extreme diet longer than I'd anticipated. The experts say two weeks, but I stayed on it for two months because Cameron still bled when I'd add in a new food.That was the hardest time! Even my pediatrician urged me to go on formula because she thought this was too much. But I wanted to keep trying because even the hypoallergenic formulas include corn syrup, and when I'd tested Cameron on corn he'd bled a lot. Plus I don't really eat processed foods myself, and formulas are so processed.I know different people have different experiences with breastfeeding. You have to do what's right for you, and this approach was right for us. Plus it worked. By the time Cameron was 7 months old he had really turned a corner, and by the time he was 10 months old I pretty much had my own diet back.There was also an upside: Thanks to my extreme diet I was back to my pre-pregnancy weight within two-and-a-half months.My biggest lesson learnedBreastfeeding was hard, and my family's support made all the difference in the world. If you run into challenges, it helps to keep in mind the many practical benefits of breast milk, including the fact that it's free and you never need to make a midnight run to the store for formula or wait for water to heat up. In the end, I felt all the hard work I put into it truly paid off, for Cameron and for me.Back to all breastfeeding essays"
Sample baby schedules for 1- and 2-month-olds,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sample-baby-schedules-for-1-and-2-month-olds_3657227.bc,"Getting into a routine with your baby is a personal thing. You'll learn to read your baby's cues to develop a pattern of eating, sleeping, and playing that meets your little one's needs and works for your family.One way your baby will communicate with you at this age is by crying, which peaks between 6 to 8 weeks and often occurs in the late afternoon or early evening. Doctors recommend the ""5 Ss"" to help soothe your baby: Swaddling, side or stomach positioning (in your arms), shushing, swinging, and sucking. Take heart: Your baby's cries will soon taper off!That said, it can be a big help to see what other moms and dads are doing. We asked parents of 1- and 2-month-olds to share their baby's daily schedule, then picked the eight below as a representative sample.As you're creating a schedule for your baby, keep in mind that in a 24-hour period most 1- and 2-month-old babies need:12 to 24 ounces of breast milk or formula, though this amount may be as high as 32 ounces. (Get specific tips on how to tell whether your baby is getting enoughbreast milk or formula.)About 16 hours of sleep  including nighttime sleep and naps. Three naps during the day (morning, afternoon, and evening) is typical. Read more about sleep needs at this age.Time for playing, developing important muscles, working on new skills, and interacting with you.

See all videosSchedule 2: A breastfeeding mom of a 5-week-old and an older childEditor's note: This schedule is a baby-led routineMy daughter and I take our days as they come. She nurses whenever she seems hungry. I have no idea how much she eats at a time. I just let her nurse as long as she wants.She takes little catnaps throughout the day (mostly while being held, which I know is ""bad,"" but she wakes up whenever I put her down), and we put her down for the night whenever she looks tired, anytime between 8 and 11 p.m.She'll usually wake up for a feeding twice at night and then sleep till around 8 a.m., then after another feed, she'll go back to sleep for a couple more hours.I hate living on a routine. It bores me to tears. So during the day I often ask my 3-year-old what she wants to do or where she wants to go. Off we go with the baby in a front carrier (she cries in the stroller or car seat, but loves the carrier).I don't pay much attention to the clock, just feed my kids when they're hungry. The only thing I stick to is bedtime for my older daughter at 8 p.m. Then Daddy takes the baby so my older child can have one-on-one time with me for her bedtime routine of jammies, teeth brushing, story, and kisses.I'm sure life will be tough when school starts, but right now the unstructured approach works for us.Schedule 3: A formula-feeding mom of a 2-month-oldEditor's note: This schedule is a combination (parent-led and baby-led) routine7:30 to 8 a.m.: Wake up.8 a.m.: He gets 6 to 8 ounces of formula.9 a.m.: He falls asleep and naps until noon or 1 p.m.1 p.m.: He gets 6 to 8 ounces of formula.We play on his activity mat, I walk around the house and tell him about things, I sing, or we sit outside on the porch or go out shopping. He really enjoys lying on his changing table while we ""talk."" I try to read to him, but he gets squirmy, so it usually lasts for only a couple pages.4 p.m.: He gets 6 to 8 ounces of formula.After his really long morning nap, he'll take one or two 15-minute catnaps. We struggle around 5 p.m. This is when he starts to get fussy if he hasn't dozed back off in the afternoon.Bath time is at 7 p.m. or a little earlier if he's really fussy. He gets a bath every night because he really relaxes in the water. I only use soap every other night, though. On the days we don't use soap, I call it his ""bird bath."" After his bath, he gets a baby massage with lotion while we sing ""Hokey Pokey"" and ""Head, Shoulders, Knees, and Toes."" I like to teach him about body parts.7:30 or 8 p.m. He gets another 6 to 8 ounces of formula. After his bottle, I hold him up over my shoulder and pat his back and we sing ""You Are My Sunshine"" a few times. I lay him down in his crib still awake, tell him I love him, and turn on his womb-sounds bear. He ""talks"" himself to sleep.We are on the verge of sleeping through the night. Just recently I tried not feeding him and only giving him the pacifier  and it worked! For about a week now, he has just gotten the binky. All I do is give him his pacifier and turn his womb-sounds bear back on and he falls back to sleep. Schedule 4: A breastfeeding mom of 7-week-old twinsEditor's note: This schedule is a combination (parent-led and baby-led) routineWake-up time is between 5 and 7 a.m., depending on what time they've gone to bed the night before.They eat every one and a half to two hours, or on demand. They nurse for ten to 20 minutes and alternate breasts at each feeding. It's best if I feed them at the same time, because that's the only way to get any ""me"" time. If one isn't awake for a feeding, I wake them up.The twins were born prematurely, so they still like to sleep a lot. They nap about three or four times a day for one to two hours at a time. When they aren't sleeping, they have tummy time to strengthen their neck muscles, I sing to them, we go for a walk, or we go to the neighbors' and visit.There's no real bedtime routine. Whenever their last feeding is for the night  usually between 10 or 11 p.m.  we put pj's on after the diaper change and swaddle and cuddle until they fall asleep. I sleep beside the crib in the nursery. Sometimes they sleep straight through until 5 a.m., or they'll get up once at about 2:30 or 3 a.m.Schedule 5: An exclusively pumping mom of a 10-week-oldEditor's note: This schedule is a combination (parent-led and baby-led) routineI get up at 6 a.m. to pump. I try to go back to bed, but my baby usually wakes up for the day around 7 a.m. and has a feeding. We feed him on demand, so if he's hungry, we give him a bottle and let him eat till he starts to play with it or spit out the milk.He usually drinks about 6 ounces at a time. He refuses to drink formula and he won't nurse, so he gets breast milk from a bottle 100 percent of the time.Naptime is between 8 and 9 a.m. He'll sleep in his crib anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour.Following his morning nap, we play for a little while, usually with him in my lap (head at my knees, feet against my belly). I sing, wave his arms around, talk to him, and imitate the faces and noises he makes.He gets a bottle and I pump. Sometimes I give him a bath. Other days, I wait until he wakes up from his evening nap.Around 1 p.m. he gets another feeding, I pump, and I try to get him to take a nap. It doesn't always work.When it does, he'll sleep for 45 minutes to an hour and a half. This nap is usually in his swing, but sometimes he'll sleep in his crib. Other times he flat out refuses, even if he can barely keep his eyes open.If he's really cranky and won't sleep, I'll take him for a walk (which almost always puts him to sleep). Around 4, I feed him and then I pump again. If we didn't take the earlier walk, we'll go now. Otherwise, we just play or snuggle while I watch TV.He'll usually nap again in the late afternoon, almost always in his swing. He won't do this one in his crib, but occasionally he'll sleep in his car seat or in his stroller.When he wakes up, I give him a bath if he hasn't had one in the morning. After the bath, we play a little more, and I put him in his pj's so that when he's done eating, I can put him to bed.I feed him between 7:30 and 8 p.m. and put him to bed between 8 and 9 p.m. I take him to his room with the lights off, and I'll give him a pacifier while we rock in the glider for five minutes or until he starts nodding off. I put him in his crib groggy but awake, shut the door, and let him sleep.He sleeps for about six hours. I pump again at 9 p.m. and midnight, then I head to bed.He wakes up at 2 to 3 a.m. to get a diaper change and a bottle, then goes right back down for the rest of the night. My husband usually gets up with him so I can get some rest. Then we get up and do it all over again the next day! Schedule 6: A formula-feeding mom of a 7-week-oldEditor's note: This schedule is a parent-led routine6 a.m.: He has 6 ounces of formula and falls back to sleep.8:30 a.m.: We hang out and cuddle, watch TV, and play. I talk and sing to him while we watch my favorite morning talk show.10 a.m.: He has 5 ounces of formula.10:15 a.m. until 12:30 p.m.: We have playtime. He lies on the activity mat or tummy mat. He holds a toy now if I put one in his hand!12:30 to 1:30 p.m.: Naptime.2 p.m.: He has 5 ounces of formula. After eating, he swings in his swing, watches his mobile or sometimes TV, and then falls asleep for a short nap.4 p.m.: The fussiness begins. He's cranky for the next several hours.6 p.m.: He has 5 ounces of formula and sits in his bouncy seat. The vibration helps him to digest, but crankiness continues until he falls asleep for short nap.7:30 p.m.: Playtime with Daddy.8:45 p.m.: Bath time and bedtime routine. I massage him with lavender lotion and put him in pj's. He gets really happy and giggly while I'm doing all of this, so I sing and talk to him. Then we have Mommy and baby quiet time together. I dim the lights and speak very softly. I do all I can to make his surroundings soothing. We listen to lullabies. This time is really special to me.9:30 p.m.: He has 6 ounces of formula and then goes to bed. I stand by the crib holding him until I get one more burp before putting him into his crib. I turn on his nightlight, give him a kiss, leave the room, and he's asleep in minutes and sleeps until 6 a.m.Schedule 7: A breastfeeding and pumping mom of a 2-month-oldEditor's note: This schedule is a combination (parent-led and baby-led) routineOur little one wakes up around 6:30 a.m., but I give him his pacifier so he'll rest until 7. I really don't want his wake-up time to be before 7 a.m.He nurses seven times during the day and night: At 7 a.m., 10 a.m., 1 p.m., 4 p.m., 7 p.m., 10 p.m., and whenever in the middle of the night  usually between 3 and 4 a.m. He'll usually spend ten minutes on each breast, or drink 3 to 4 ounces if I pump.He always takes a good nap in the morning from about 8 until 11 a.m. I try to do the ""eat, then play, then sleep"" cycle. He usually gets really sleepy or fussy about an hour after he eats and falls back to sleep for half an hour to an hour until his next feeding.Between eating and napping times, we do things together. He just started to grab the toys hanging above his bouncy seat. I hold him and sing to him. He loves to ""talk,"" but he only speaks whale right now. He also loves to stand and he ""walks"" up my belly. He loves to go for rides in the car.After his 7 p.m. feeding, I give him a bath and a massage with lotion. We read a story, then I put him to bed. This usually begins his fussy time. He will eventually fall asleep around 8 or 8:30. I wake him up at 10 p.m. to change him and feed him. He always goes right back to sleep without crying and is out for five or six hours until his 3 or 4 a.m. feeding. I love that I can count on that. Schedule 8: A formula-feeding dad of a 7-week-oldEditor's note: This schedule is a combination (parent-led and baby-led) routineJust for the record, I'm the proud daddy. I've been able to take advantage of paternity leave and have stayed at home two days a week with our baby girl. She's our first, and we feel blessed.She wakes up between 8 and 9:30 a.m. and has a bottle. Unfortunately we're exclusively formula feeding now. Due to misinformation and our own lack of knowledge on the subject, my wife lost her milk after a few weeks. Our little girl eats about four to five times a day and has about 6 ounces at each feeding.Until a couple of weeks ago, she was asleep more than awake. She still naps a lot, but while she's awake she has Mom, me, Grandma, and Grandpa all vying for her attention. There's a lot of singing and story reading going on.She goes down for sleep at about 11 p.m. Prior to this we feed her, change her, and give her a bath. After the bath, we use lotion and give her a little massage. We have some CDs that are supposed to help with sleep. I don't know whether they work, but the classical music is very relaxing.She's like me  as soon as her head hits the pillow, she's out. She usually wakes up once at about 4 a.m., and we feed her and change her.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015. Amount and schedule of formula feedings.

Breastfeeding an adopted baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-an-adopted-baby_8482.bc,"What do I need to know?You may be surprised to learn that you don't have to give birth to nurse a baby  you can breastfeed an adopted baby. But only half of all adopting mothers who attempt to breastfeed will make any milk at all and few will produce enough to fully satisfy their babies.It's the suckling of a child that triggers milk production, not an automatic physiological reaction that begins during pregnancy. Hormones drive the production of breast milk. Prolactin, a hormone created by the pituitary gland, makes breast milk, and if you stimulate the breast enough to increase prolactin levels, you will get milk.An increase in the hormones estrogen and progesterone during pregnancy do help prepare a woman's body for breastfeeding by enlarging the ducts and alveoli  so it's more difficult to start the milk flowing in mothers who haven't delivered a child.Learn more about how your body makes breast milk.What challenges could I face?Inducing lactation isn't complicated, but it does take time: Buy or rent a hospital-grade breast pump, and use it often. But don't expect to lactate overnight. It can take a month or more of regular pumping to trigger milk production (start slow but build up to eight to ten times a day). Timing this with your baby's arrival can be tricky, since few adoptive parents get much advance notice.While adoptive moms can nurse, they usually can't produce as much milk as women who go through pregnancy (that's where the hormones come in).How can I solve these problems?Think of breastfeeding as an opportunity to teach your new baby who her mommy is, and where she can turn for comfort and love. But don't expect to be your baby's sole source of nutrition.""The goal for adoptive mothers who are nursing isn't producing a certain amount of milk  it's bonding with the child,"" says Susan Condon, an international board-certified lactation consultant. ""Most women say they aren't concerned with the volume of milk that they produce. They just want the opportunity to be close to their new baby.""You probably won't be able to coax a full supply of milk from your breasts, so you'll need to supplement. But that doesn't mean you have to use bottles.Condon recommends the Medela Supplemental Nursing System (SNS), which allows you to feed formula to your baby formula through a pair of thin tubes you attach to your areola with surgical tape. Your baby nurses normally and gets a mix of formula and whatever breast milk you're producing. If you use this method, plan on supplementing with premixed or concentrated formula, not the the powdered version, which might have trouble going through the tubing if it's not mixed thoroughly.Another popular system is the Lact-Aid Nursing Trainer. It works like the Medela system but has soft, collapsible plastic bags instead of plastic bottles to hold the formula, making it possible to nurse your baby more discreetly. These supplementers have two functions: They ensure that your baby is getting enough food and they encourage nipple sucking, which triggers more breast milk production.It might be possible to use donor breast milk instead of formula. Because the demand for donated breast milk is higher than the supply, your baby may have to meet certain criteria. Talk with your baby's doctor to see whether you qualify.Where can I get more help?La Leche League International is one of the best resources for any nursing mother. La Leche can provide more information on this subject, and possibly connect you with other adoptive mothers in your area who are nursing. The group also has a few pamphlets about inducing lactation.Condon recommends the book Breastfeeding the Adopted Baby, by Debra Peterson. ""I bet a lot of adoptive moms have no idea this is something they can do,"" she says. ""If women knew they had the choice, I think a lot of them would try nursing."""
Iron-deficiency anemia in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-deficiency-anemia-in-babies_10860.bc,"My baby seems pale and weak. Could it be anemia?Yes. In fact, the most typical signs of anemia are pale skin and tiredness. Other signs include rapid heartbeat, irritability, loss of appetite, brittle nails, and a sore or swollen tongue. But it's common for a baby with anemia not to have any symptoms at all.What is anemia, and what causes it?People become anemic when red blood cells don't carry enough oxygen to the tissues in their body. Various conditions can cause anemia, including an inherited illness called sickle cell anemia, but iron deficiency is the most common cause.The human body needs iron to make hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying red pigment in blood. If your baby doesn't get enough iron, he'll have fewer red blood cells  and the ones he has will be smaller, so his body tissues will receive less oxygen than they should.Children are especially susceptible to anemia during periods of rapid growth, when they need extra iron that they don't always get. But iron-deficiency anemia doesn't happen overnight  it's caused by a relatively severe deficiency that develops over time.Iron deficiencies can happen for several reasons, including not enough iron in the diet, ongoing blood loss (in the intestinal tract, for example), and poor absorption of iron.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.Is anemia dangerous?It can be.In addition to the symptoms mentioned above, a child who's anemic could suffer permanent mental and physical problems. (While an iron deficiency can be corrected, the mental and physical impairment is not always reversible.)Iron deficiency also makes kids more susceptible to lead poisoning and infection.Is my baby at risk for anemia?Between 9 and 24 months, all children are at high risk for anemia, but these babies are at highest risk:Premature and low-birth-weight babies age 2 months old and older. Full-term infants are born with iron stores accumulated during the last months in utero. These stores can last four to six months. The iron stores of babies born prematurely may last only about two months.Babies who drink cow's milk before their first birthday. Cow's milk is low in iron. It also interferes with the body's absorption of iron, and it may replace some iron-rich foods in the diet. Milk can also irritate the lining of a baby's intestine, causing bleeding. This slow loss of blood in the stool  along with low iron intake  can cause anemia.Breastfed babies who receive no iron-fortified foods after 4 months of age. The iron in breast milk is absorbed three times better than the iron in formula, but around the time a baby starts eating solids, he needs additional iron in the form of fortified cereals and other iron-rich foods.Full-term, formula-fed babies who aren't given iron-fortified formula. Most baby formula is fortified with iron, however.Should I call the doctor?The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that babies be screened for anemia at 12 months, or earlier if they were born prematurely. But if you notice any signs of anemia, do call your baby's doctor.To determine whether your baby is anemic, the doctor will do a blood test to measure levels of hemoglobin and hematocrit (percentage of red blood cells in the blood).Can I prevent my baby from becoming anemic?You can prevent your baby from developing iron deficiency anemia. Here's how:If your baby was born prematurely or at a low birth weight, talk with his doctor about iron supplements.Until he's a year old, give your baby breast milk or iron-fortified formula, not cow's milk.If your baby is 4 months old and breastfed and not yet eating solid foods, the AAP recommends giving him an iron supplement of 11 milligrams (mg) per day until he starts eating iron-rich foods.Once your baby starts eating solids, feed him iron-fortified cereal, and eventually iron-rich foods like lean meats, poultry, and fish; iron-fortified pasta, rice, and bread; leafy green vegetables; egg yolks; and legumes. (See our age-by-age guide for more details about when to feed your baby various foods.)Offer plenty of fruits and vegetables that are rich in vitamin C, such as kiwi, avocado, and cantaloupe). Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron.How is anemia treated in babies?It's important to boost your baby's iron intake once he's eating solids, but dietary changes aren't always enough to correct anemia. He may also need an iron supplement, usually given in the form of drops.Iron is absorbed best on an empty stomach. But because iron can cause tummy upset (and has an unpleasant taste, besides), your doctor may suggest giving the supplement to your baby with food, breast milk, or formula. Your doctor will probably recheck your child's hemoglobin/hematocrit levels after he has been on the supplement for a month or two.It usually takes a couple of months for the blood count to return to normal, and then another six to 12 months to replenish iron stores. After that, they can probably be maintained with an iron-rich diet.Should I give my baby an iron supplement, just in case?Iron supplements are helpful in many instances, but too much iron can be poisonous, so always consult your doctor before giving your baby iron supplements. Doctors often recommend extra iron for breastfed babies starting at age 4 months. Get all the details in our expert's answer to the question ""Does my baby need an iron supplement?""If you do have iron supplements in the house (or vitamins that contain iron), make sure you keep them locked up and well out of your young child's reach. Iron is a leading cause of accidental poisoning.Show sources Hide sources Baker RD, et al. 2010.

Reflux and GERD in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_reflux-and-gerd-in-babies_10900.bc,"Is it normal for my baby to spit up so much?That depends. It's perfectly normal for babies to spit up after feedings or even to vomit once in a while without apparent cause or warning. In fact, some babies spit up quite frequently and show no ill effects. This is called reflux, and most babies outgrow it by age 1.But when babies spit up a lot and it affects their growth or causes throat pain or breathing problems, it's called gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD. Other symptoms may include coughing or gagging during feedings or showing signs of abdominal pain, like arching their back, drawing up their legs, and waking up screaming.Should I call the doctor?If your baby spits up quite a bit but doesn't seem uncomfortable and is gaining weight just fine, you probably don't need to call his doctor. Just mention it at the next checkup.On the other hand, if you think the reflux is distressing your baby or affecting his weight gain, schedule an appointment as soon as you can. Your baby's doctor can tell you whether he has GERD and help you ease his suffering.Also let your doctor know if your baby vomits forcefully after feedings. This is called projectile vomiting, and it may be a sign of pyloric stenosis, a condition that can lead to serious problems like malnourishment and dehydration.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.What causes reflux?A baby may have reflux when her esophageal sphincter (the valve connecting the esophagus to the stomach) is weak or not working properly. This allows food and gastric juices to flow back up out of her stomach and into her mouth. Its also what causes heartburn in adults.How is GERD diagnosed and treated?The doctor will examine your baby and ask you to describe the symptoms. To reduce the reflux, she'll likely suggest a few things you can try at home. These may include keeping the baby upright after feedings; giving him smaller, more frequent meals; burping him more frequently; and thickening the milk or formula with infant cereal. (See more about these techniques below.)She may also suggest eliminating cow's milk from your diet if you're breastfeeding or switching to a hypoallergenic formula, because the reflux symptoms can be caused by an intolerance of certain milk proteins.If these measures don't work, she may prescribe medication. Some babies respond right away to antacids or acid blockers. (But never give these medications to your baby without consulting a doctor.) Your baby may be on the medication for a few months.If these medications don't help, the doctor might do further tests or refer you to a gastroenterologist to be sure that GERD is the problem.The tests may include X-rays of the upper gastrointestinal tract. (This is called an upper GI series.) Your baby will have to drink a chalky substance called barium beforehand. The X-rays will show whether there are any anatomic problems that could affect swallowing.The doctor might also do a scope of the digestive tract, including taking some biopsies (small tissue samples). This is an inpatient procedure in which the baby is sedated and a tiny camera is threaded down through the esophagus, stomach, and sometimes small intestines to see if there's any inflammation or damage to the tissues.Another test your baby may have is a 24-hour pH probe study. In this procedure, he's checked into the hospital overnight and a very thin tube is threaded through the nose down to the base of his esophagus and monitored for 24 hours. This test measures the frequency and severity of reflux episodes as well as the baby's breathing and heart rate.If your baby continues to spit up a lot, your doctor will also want to monitor his weight. Some babies with GERD don't gain weight properly because they aren't keeping enough food down. Others lose their appetite because all that stomach acid pushing up into the esophagus can hurt the throat and, in severe cases, make it hard to swallow.Also, if some of the stomach contents get into the nose or lungs, a baby with GERD might develop respiratory problems like pneumonia, a cough at night, or sinus or ear infections. The stomach acid can also damage tooth enamel. What can I do to ease my baby's symptoms?Try holding her in a more vertical position while feeding, and keep her upright for a bit right after feedings, too. (Don't put her down for tummy timeor a nap  or even a diaper change  right after she eats, for example.)Giving her less breast milk or formula at each feeding may help, too. You can make up for the smaller quantity with more frequent feedings. And make sure to burp her until you get a good burp after every feeding.Ask the doctor if you should thicken your baby's breast milk or formula with a little infant cereal or use a formula that comes with ""added rice starch."" (The doctor will explain how to mix the cereal into milk or formula. You'll also need to use a bottle nipple with a wider hole or variable flow to allow the thickened fluid through.)Keeping your child away from tobacco smoke can reduce reflux symptoms and is a good idea anyway.While other parents may suggest letting your baby sleep in a car seat, experts don't recommend this because it seems to put more pressure on her stomach and may increase reflux symptoms.In fact, experts generally don't recommend letting your baby sleep in a car seat, bouncy seat, or swing  even strapped in  because these products have not been studied for that purpose. They may have padding or inserts that pose a suffocation risk, and the baby could move enough to flip a car seat over when it's not installed in a car.Also, never use a pillow or a sleep positioner to prop up your baby. They could cause your baby to suffocate.Finally, while letting a baby sleep on her stomach may help with GERD symptoms, experts don't recommend it because it increases your baby's risk for SIDS.Show sources Hide sources GlaxoSmithKline. 2005.

Gassy tummy,https://www.babycenter.com/0_gassy-tummy_10393850.bc,"How can I tell if my baby has a gassy tummy?If your baby is fussy for no obvious reason, it may well be gas pain. Babies with gas pain also tend to pull up their legs and then stretch out, arching their back. (These symptoms could also be signs of colic or reflux.)What could be causing my baby's gas?Several factors could cause your child to have a gassy tummy.Gas pain is common in babies in the first three months of life while their intestines are maturing. It's also common between ages 6 and 12 months, when they're trying lots of different foods for the first time.Ingesting a particular protein in formula or breast milkGas pain in a breastfed baby may be caused by intolerance to a protein in your diet. Identifying and eliminating the offending food may help. (Dairy products are a common culprit.)If your baby is formula-fed and seems to have gas pain, it's possible he has an intolerance to the protein in his formula. If that's the case, his doctor can recommend a hypoallergenic option.Eating certain vegetablesLike adults, babies can be extra gassy after eating certain vegetables, such as broccoli and cauliflower. If your child eats these healthy foods, that's a good thing. Just make sure you don't overload her with too many gas-inducing veggies at consecutive meals.Drinking juiceBabies should not drink anything other than breast milk or formula (and water once they're 6 months old). They're likely to have a difficult time digesting the fructose and sucrose in juice, and as a result, it can bring on gas, or even diarrhea.Not drinking enough waterWater is not recommended for babies younger than 6 months.Once your baby is 6 months old, drinking water won't eliminate gas problems, but it will improve constipation or any difficulty he has passing stools. (Constipation often coincides with gas and abdominal discomfort.)Offer your 6-month-old 2 to 4 ounces of water a day in addition to breast milk or formula. As your baby gets closer to 12 months, increase that to 4 to 6 ounces of water a day.How can I ease my baby's gas pain?Check the bottleIf your baby's bottle-fed, it's important to find a bottle that won't make her gulp. The more air she swallows during feedings, the more likely she is to have tummy trouble.The hole in the nipple shouldn't be too small or too large. A too-small hole will tend to frustrate her and make her gulp for more food. And a too-large hole causes the liquid to flow too quickly.Some bottles are specially designed to reduce air intake and will say so on the packaging. Some are curved, while others have internal vents or liners to prevent air bubbles from forming in the liquid and keep the nipple from collapsing.Keep babies upright for feedingsYou might try holding your baby more upright during feedings to help the formula or breast milk travel more smoothly to his tummy. If he's curled up or hunched over, air is more likely to get trapped in there with his food.Avoid frantic feedingsFeed your baby before she's starving. If she's crying from hunger, she's more likely to gulp air along with her meal. Try to feed her in a calm environment: Turn down the lights, put on some soft music, and ask siblings to play quietly (you can always hope).Burp him oftenFrequent burping helps get air bubbles out of your baby's tummy. Don't wait until he's finished a feeding to burp him. Prop him up for a burping when you change sides while nursing or every few minutes when bottle-feeding.Do the baby bicyclePut your baby on her back, hold her feet, and gently move her legs in a bicycling motion several times a day. (Diaper changes are a good time to try this.) For some babies, this motion relieves gas and other tummy discomforts.Massage your baby's bellyIn addition to helping your baby relax, a gentle belly rub might help dispel gas or at least help his tummy feel better. You could also try placing your baby across your knees, tummy down, and rubbing his back. This sometimes helps release excess pressure.Gas drops and moreThe best thing you can do is to try to eliminate or manage the offending food or habit that's triggering your child's gas. When your child does have uncomfortable gas pain, you can give him infant gas relief drops to help upper and lower gastrointestinal discomfort. Gripe water or probiotics may also be helpful.When to call the doctorIf you find yourself treating your child several times a day for more than three consecutive days, or if her gas coincides with such other symptoms as vomiting, diarrhea, or fever, call your doctor right away. Your child might have a more serious condition, like a food allergy, stomach flu, or GERD. Show sources Hide sources AAFP. 2013. Colic.

My breastfeeding story: I couldn't breastfeed my baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-i-couldnt-breastfeed-my-baby_10405876.bc,"Name: CrystalLives in: Jersey City, New JerseyBreastfeeding experience: Stressful, disappointing, and upsettingMain challenges: Lactation failure; took time to diagnose the problem; felt shamed by lactation consultantsBreastfed for: Tried for 5 weeks before finally giving upMy storyWhen I gave birth to Nikka four years ago I couldn't breastfeed her  not that I didn't try. I followed the nurse's instructions and gave her my breast right after she was born. I didn't see any milk but she was very sleepy, and I hoped she was at least getting colostrum.After three days with no real improvement, I became concerned. I checked in with the hospital's lactation consultant who squeezed some colostrum from my breast and told me to stop worrying, my milk would come in soon.The next day when I still had no milk, I began giving Nikka formula because she was crying and clearly very hungry. I kept trying to nurse her as well but felt a growing panic as the days wore on and my breast milk failed to arrive.I also felt tremendous guilt. One consultant left me with reading materials that said, ""If you don't breastfeed your baby, she won't be as smart as she could have been.""None of the experts I spoke to could tell me why my milk hadn't come in. My husband and I scoured the Internet and read breastfeeding books. We could only surmise that I had some kind of low milk supply problem.On day seven I took my daughter to her first pediatric visit. Her wonderful doctor was the first person to take me seriously and try to help. She asked about other known causes of low supply, including whether I'd lost a lot of blood during childbirth.When these were ruled out, she recommended trying the herbal supplement fenugreek. After taking the capsules for three days, I was able to produce about an ounce of milk at each pumping. This was not nearly enough to feed my daughter, who was drinking several ounces of formula at each feeding. But at least I could bottle-feed this small amount of my breast milk to her.After that I saw two lactation consultants who recommended I rent a hospital-grade breast pump. I pumped every three hours for two weeks  something that was supposed to teach my body to start producing more milk  but never managed to increase my supply.In the meantime, the consultants showed me how to use slow-flow bottle nipples so my baby wouldn't get used to a fast flow from the bottle and then reject my breast. One also gave me a device called the Supplemental Nursing System, which allowed my baby to feed at my breast and practice nursing while a tiny tube inserted in the side of her mouth simultaneously supplied formula.Finally, after three agonizing weeks, I was referred to Mona Gabbay, a doctor who specializes in helping mothers and babies breastfeed. She suspected I had a low level of prolactin (the hormone that stimulates milk production), and a blood test confirmed her suspicions.I'm sorry I didn't find this out earlier. Knowing that I might not be able to produce milk  no matter how hard I tried  would have alleviated the panic and trauma I experienced. Instead I spent five weeks strapped to a breast pump rather than cuddling with my baby because everybody told me to just try harder.Too many of the experts I turned to seemed to believe that mothers who use formula are lazy and even cruel, which made my situation even more painful. My daughter not only survived because of formula, she thrived. She's now a healthy, active, and very bright 4-year-old.My biggest lesson learnedDo not feel guilty for being unable to breastfeed. The human body doesn't always work the way it's supposed to and there really is nothing wrong with giving your baby formula. If you're having problems, find a doctor who specializes in breastfeeding so that all the medical reasons for lactation failure can be investigated. Lactation consultants, who can be very helpful in many situations, often cannot diagnose medical reasons for lactation failure.Back to all breastfeeding essaysShow sources Hide sources Breastfeeding Medicine.

Sample baby schedules for 11- and 12-month-olds,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sample-baby-schedules-for-11-and-12-month-olds_3657182.bc,"What babies need when it comes to eat, play, and sleepGetting into a routine with your baby is a personal thing. Learn to read your baby's cues to develop a pattern of eating, playing, and sleeping that works for your family. As you create a schedule for your baby, keep in mind that at 11 and 12 months most babies need:Solid foods three times a day. By now your baby should be eating a variety of different foods and taking an active role at mealtimes by self-feedingand drinking from asippy cup.At 11 to 12 months: 22 to 32 ounces of breast milk or formula in a 24-hour period. (Get specific tips on how to tell whether your baby is getting enoughbreast milk or formula.) Beginning at 12 months, your baby cantransition to whole cow's milkand should drink less than 32 ounces a day (more than this can reduce your child's appetite for other healthy foods and can lead toiron deficiency anemia).A little less than 14 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period  this includes nighttime sleep andnaps. Two naps during the day (morning and afternoon) is typical, though some babies will move toward just one long nap each day.Read more about sleep needs at this age.Time for playing, working on new skills, and interacting with you.It can be a big help to see what other moms and dads do. We asked parents of 11- and 12-month-olds to share their baby's daily schedule, then picked the seven below as a helpful representation.Schedule 1: A formula-feeding stay-at-home mom of an 11-month-oldEditor's note: This schedule is a combination (parent-led and baby-led) routine7:30 to 8 a.m.: Noah wakes up, has an 8-ounce bottle.9:30 to 10 a.m.: Breakfast  oatmeal mixed with yogurt or pureed fruit, plus finger foods like small pieces of bagel and cheese or dry cereal.10:30 a.m.: Nap, usually for two hours.12:30 p.m.: Lunch  things like small pieces of ravioli, mac and cheese, chicken, veggies, toasted cheese sandwich, or sunflower butter and apple spread sandwich.

Age-by-age guide to feeding your baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_age-by-age-guide-to-feeding-your-baby_1400680.bc,"Use this guide to find out what and how much to feed your child in the first year. The amounts are general recommendations only, so don't worry if your little one eats a bit more or less than suggested. It's always a good idea to discuss your plan for starting solids with your childs doctor before getting started.Also, you don't have to introduce foods to your child in any special order. If you want to give your baby a taste of tofu at age 6 months, go ahead, even though it's not listed on our chart until age 8 months. And while cereal is a traditional first food in the United States, it's fine to start with mashed fruits or vegetables instead.In most cases, you don't even have to wait to introduce highly allergenic foods like eggs, fish, and peanuts. (Read more about food allergies and ask your doctor to be sure.)Also, see our new rules for feeding your baby and get ideas for adventurous first foods.Age: Birth to 4 monthsFeeding behaviorRooting reflex helps your baby turn toward a nipple to find nourishment.What to feedBreast milk or formula ONLYHow much per dayHow to tell if your baby's getting enough breast milkHow to tell how much formula your baby needsFeeding tipYour baby's digestive tract is still developing, so solid food is off-limits for now.Age: 4 to 6 monthsSigns of readiness for solid foodThe following are some guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics.

Are plastic baby bottles safe?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_are-plastic-baby-bottles-safe_14387.bc,"What's the concern about BPA in formula cans and plastic baby bottles?Bisphenol A (BPA) is a chemical that was used in polycarbonate plastic products and epoxy resin-based food can liners for decades to harden plastic, keep bacteria out of food, and prevent rust. Although there's little scientific data on the effects of BPA on humans, results from animal studies suggest that it's unsafe.Today, plastic baby bottles manufactured by American companies no longer contain BPA. That's because in 2009 the six major manufacturers of baby bottles and sippy cups  representing more than 90 percent of the U.S. market  stopped making their products with BPA. And in 2012, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned BPA in the manufacture of all baby bottles and sippy cups.BPA also used to be present in infant formula packaging, but not anymore: By the time the FDA banned the use of BPA in formula packaging in 2013, manufacturers had already stopped using it.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) says human exposure to BPA has dropped significantly in recent years, but some health and environmental groups believe more needs to be done to get BPA out of consumer products because a wide range of products  such as food storage containers, plastic tableware, and food packaging  are still manufactured with BPA.Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.How does BPA get into my baby's food?Problems arise when the chemical leaches out of the bottle or container into the liquid or food that's in contact with the plastic. If your baby drinks or eats from a polycarbonate container, it's possible that he's also getting a small dose of BPA.The amount that leaches depends mostly on whether the container is heated (in the dishwasher or microwave, for example) and the temperature of the liquid or food. High temperatures lead to the release of more BPA.Although the FDA has banned BPA from baby bottles, sippy cups, and formula packaging, the agency asserts that other polycarbonate products are safe and that the BPA levels found in humans are very low. However, some medical experts, scientists, and environmental experts disagree.According to the Environmental Working Group, studies that show the harmful health effects of BPA outnumber studies that don't by a margin of 9 to 1. Also, dozens of state and national environmental health organizations in the United States and Canada have called for a moratorium on the use of BPA in food and beverage containers. Many believe that the evidence is strong enough for parents to consider taking steps to reduce their infant's exposure to BPA when possible.How is BPA harmful?Your bodys endocrine system is made up of glands that release hormones to regulate growth, metabolism, and sexual development and function. When consumed, BPA mimics the hormone estrogen (becomes ""estrogenic"") and disrupts the natural balance of your endocrine system.Animal studies show that low levels of BPA affect the hormones that control the development of the brain, the reproductive system, and the immune system. In laboratory rats, exposure to BPA has been linked to an increased risk of some cancers, decreased sperm counts and reduced fertility, and hyperactivity. BPA exposure has also been linked to obesity, diabetes, and the early onset of puberty.The National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Environmental Protection Agency brought together experts who reviewed 700 published studies on BPA. They found that the BPA levels in humans are higher than the levels causing adverse effects in animal studies. Are BPA-free plastics safe?The NIH says parents can safely use baby bottles identified as ""BPA-free."" The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says that BPA-free bottles and bottles made of polyethylene or polypropylene are also safe for babies. However, some studies suggest that harmful chemicals leach regardless of the type of plastic  even those labeled ""BPA-free.""A 2011 study published in the journal Environmental Health Perspectives analyzed 500 plastic products used to contain food, including baby bottles, and found that almost all of them leached estrogen-like chemicals that disrupt hormone activity  in some cases, the BPA-free products released chemicals that were more disruptive than the products containing BPA. Environmental and health experts agree that BPA isn't the only chemical to be concerned about. A single piece of plastic may contain five to 30 chemicals, and a plastic item with multiple parts (like a baby bottle) may contain more than 100. Even a thin sheet of plastic wrap can leach chemicals into your food when heated in the microwave.""Plastic food containers and packaging contain dozens of ingredients  many having estrogenic effects,"" says Sonya Lunder, a senior research analyst with the Environmental Working Group. ""BPA is one of the most potent additives. It's a good idea for parents to avoid polycarbonate plastic, which leaches BPA, and take precautions with all plastic food containers.""Lunder says it's important to avoid putting plastic in the oven or microwave because heated plastic leaches estrogenic compounds. If you prepare baby formula with boiled water, she recommends cooling it before pouring it into your baby's bottle or sippy cup.Is there BPA in other products?Yes. BPA turns up in many other plastic items, such as toys, dental sealants, and water bottles. It's also found in the can liners of many canned goods.Among other items, BPA is also found in electronics, eyeglass lenses, medical equipment, and the coating of cash register receipts, but scientists believe oral exposure is the primary concern for infants right now.How can I protect my baby?""While all of us and our children are regularly exposed to low levels of myriad chemicals, including BPA, there are some measures we can take to avoid at least some of these exposures,"" says Shanna Swan, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Icahn School of Medicine in New York City. ""A good general principle is to avoid unnecessary exposures to chemicals in your food and water and to choose options that convey lower exposure whenever possible.""If you're concerned about your baby's exposure to BPA and other chemicals, baby bottles are an important source to address. Here are some concrete things you can do:Breastfeed your baby. This one step will help you avoid chemicals in bottles.If you bottle-feed your baby, avoid plastic bottles and choose bottles made of glass or stainless steel.If you prefer plastic bottles, the AAP recommends bottles labeled ""BPA-free"" or plastic bottles made of polypropylene or polyethylene. (They're usually opaque or colored rather than clear and are marked with the recycling numbers 2 or 5.)Note: Don't put any type of plastic in the microwave or dishwasher, and don't use boiling water with plastic items because high temperatures can accelerate the release of chemicals from the plastic. For safe cleaning, use a nonabrasive sponge or bottle brush, scrub with warm, soapy water, and rinse well.Avoid hand-me-down plastic bottles or bottles marked with the recycling number 7 or ""PC"" (for polycarbonate) because they may contain BPA. If you do use polycarbonate bottles, don't boil, microwave, or wash them in the dishwasher.To warm a plastic bottle with formula or breast milk, place it in a bowl of warm water or run it under warm water.Get rid of baby bottles and sippy cups that turn cloudy or are scratched or cracked. Worn bottles may leach chemicals more easily. How can I protect my family?Here are some steps you can take to reduce your family's exposure to BPA and other chemicals:Don't put plastic dishware or food storage containers in the microwave or dishwasher, and don't wash them with harsh detergents. High heat and abrasive cleansers can damage the plastic, which will make it leach more.Use a paper towel or a ceramic plate instead of plastic wrap to cover food you heat in the microwave.When buying plastic containers and food packaging such as plastic wrap, check the bottom of the containers and avoid items with the following recycling codes: 3 (may contain phthalates), 6 (may contain the neurotoxin styrene), and 7 or PC (may contain BPA).Eat food from a variety of sources so you don't rely on canned goods. (Most canned goods have a BPA liner.)For more guidelines, Swan suggests checking the Environmental Working Group website.Is anything being done about this?Congress is currently evaluating whether BPA should be regulated. Meanwhile, states aren't waiting for word from Congress: As of 2015, 13 states and the District of Columbia had enacted laws banning the sale of children's products containing BPA such as baby bottles, cups, food containers, and other items.""Let your representative know that you want to be informed about BPA and other additives in the products you and your family are exposed to,"" says Swan. ""Foods, food containers, and personal care products should be labeled as to their contents.""You can tell the government you want more testing and tighter regulation of potentially harmful chemicals as well as labels that enable you to identify hazardous ingredients and make informed purchasing decisions. And call for research on alternatives to BPA-lined cans.The League of Women Voter's website can put you in touch with your federal and state elected officials. And you can check the National Conference of State Legislatures to see where your state stands on BPA legislation.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015. Baby bottles and bisphenol A (BPA).

When you just can't breastfeed,https://www.babycenter.com/0_when-you-just-cant-breastfeed_8485.bc,"When Bay Area parent Charlene Hedge gave birth to her son, she took it for granted that she would breastfeed him. But it was not to be. Hedge couldn't produce enough breast milk, and even though she fed her baby every hour in hopes of increasing her milk supply, her son still wasn't getting what he needed.""They always say breast milk is best,"" she says. ""That I couldn't provide for him bothered me for a bit.""Her son fussed constantly, frustrated and unhappy. And Hedge was exhausted by the hourly feedings. Three weeks later, after consulting her doctor, the nurses at the hospital, and her baby's doctor, she called it quits.""Nature just didn't work for me,"" says Hedge, whose son grew into a healthy, happy toddler. ""I could cry and get really depressed, but it wasn't going to change anything."" So she let the whole thing go.Whatever your reasons for not breastfeeding  health, intense discomfort, or unrelenting frustration  give yourself a break. ""Good parenting is more than breastfeeding,"" says Jan Barger, an international board certified lactation consultant (IBCLC).Did you try your best to nurse your baby? Did you turn to others  a lactation consultant, your midwife or doctor, your baby's doctor, your partner  for help? If so, chances are you've already exhausted all available resources and are doing what's best for you and your baby.What should I do now that I'm not breastfeeding?Give yourself a breakIf you've been dead set on breastfeeding since pregnancy, you're probably feeling disappointed. Just like moms who opt for natural childbirth but end up needing a cesarean, women who want to breastfeed but can't often feel a sense of failure and sometimes blame themselves.Try not to beat yourself up, but do take the time you need to feel sad, mad, or any other emotion you may be experiencing. ""Mourn your inability to breastfeed,"" says Barger. ""For some moms, this is a loss."" Avoid telling yourself that you should've tried for another day or another feeding. ""Some of us have a lot of stick-to-it-iveness,"" says Barger. ""But some just don't. And that's okay.""And even though experts say that breastfeeding is the best nutritional option for babies, it's not right  or possible  for every mother. In 2016, the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists reinforced the advice to breastfeed if at all possible, but said a woman's doctors should respect her opinion about whether breastfeeding is right for her.Today's commercially prepared formulas are nutritious and even contain some vitamins and nutrients that breastfed babies need to get from supplements, so if you can't breastfeed you can still feel confident that your baby is getting what she needs.Formula Feeding Problem SolverIf your baby's having any problems with formula feeding, our tool can help.Talk about your feelingsIf you consulted a lactation expert through all your nursing troubles, talk to her. Be honest about your feelings. She'll likely offer soothing and consoling words that you should take to heart.Your spouse or partner, good friends, and family members can also be great sounding boards for your feelings. Take a chance and open up to them.Find out about donated breast milkIf your heart's set on feeding your baby breast milk and your child meets certain criteria  like being premature or ill  you may qualify for donated breast milk from a milk bank. Talk to your child's doctor about the possibilities.Can I still bond with my baby if I don't breastfeed?Absolutely. Breastfeeding is a wonderful way to strengthen your connection with your child, but it isn't the only way. At feeding time, hold your infant close to you and make eye contact.One client of Barger's who couldn't breastfeed ended up bottle-feeding her child as if she were nursing him. She held him in a breastfeeding position and had lots of skin-to-skin contact.Remember that your relationship with your child won't be based solely on your ability to nurse her. How you respond when she cries, how often you hold and play with her, and how you are as a parent matters more than how you feed her.Where can I turn for support?BabyCenter's Formula Feeding Mamas group is a great place to find other moms who are bottle-feeding, whether by choice or necessity. Get your questions answered or just meet other moms who know what you're going through.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a. Benefits of breastfeeding for mom.

"My breastfeeding story: Pain and low supply, then big improvement",https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-pain-and-low-supply-then-big-improvem_10414444.bc,"Name: PriyaLives in: Rutherford, New JerseyBreastfeeding experience: Tough at first, then got easierMain challenges: Pain, low supply, baby started to prefer bottleBreastfed for: 12 monthsMy storyMy mom breastfed me until I was 13 months so I always thought, ""Okay, my mom did it, so I should do it."" I took a breastfeeding class and I thought, ""I can do this.""But it was tough. I remember we went to the doctor in the first week because my daughter was crying a lot, and her pediatrician said, ""She's hungry,"" and suggested I formula-feed. My supply was low. I felt like a failure. Everyone has their ideas before they have the baby, and I thought breastfeeding wouldn't be hard, but it turned out to be hard for me.With the doctor's orders, I tried to let go of some of my feelings of inadequacy and started supplementing with formula anytime it seemed like my daughter wasn't getting enough milk. I'd give her maybe 2 ounces of formula at a time, at most.Another problem was that, in the beginning, breastfeeding was very painful for me. I had bleeding nipples. In fact, one of my nipples was so scarred within two weeks of leaving the hospital that I wasn't letting my daughter feed on that side. I was just pumping. In retrospect, I wasn't nursing my daughter as much as I would have otherwise because I was so fearful about the pain.6 things you'll need for breastfeeding Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:27Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:27Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

I had flu-like symptoms and a fever and I was like, ""What the heck?"" I texted my friends who'd had babies, and they were like, ""Oh, that's mastitis!"" I went to the doctor, and he gave me a prescription for antibiotics. When I took them, my supply went down, and I was freaking out.But once I hit the five-week mark, things got better. The breastfeeding wasn't painful anymore, and I started enjoying it. By two months in, I was able to completely stop using formula. It's been exclusively breast milk since then. I just kept working at it. One day it was like, ""Oh this doesn't hurt! We can both enjoy it now.""However, by the time my daughter was 3 or 4 months old, she'd been getting the bottle enough that she started preferring it to the breast. Every time I'd offer the breast, she'd cry and wouldn't eat as much. But she was hungry.So from then on, I ended up exclusively pumping and bottle-feeding her my milk. I kind of missed nursing, but it wasn't working for us. And I recognized that breast milk was important for her overall growth and health, so I made a commitment to pumping.One good thing about pumping from early on is that I was able to build up a stash that went into the freezer. And that was helpful to have because during the times that my supply has temporarily dropped  like each time I get my period  I've been able to use that milk for my daughter. Her appetite is huge.I have my own office, so pumping at work isn't an issue, and I have two pumps  one at work and one at home. I don't take lunches now; I just use that time to pump. I do it five to six times a day. It's so easy, how could I not continue? I told myself I was going to do it until my daughter's first birthday, and now that that's almost here, I'm about ready to stop. I plan on switching her to whole cow's milk.My biggest lesson learnedAt the end of the day, you have to do what's right for you. For me, it was pumping and bottle-feeding until the one-year mark, and I'm working my hardest to fulfill that. One thing that really helped me is that I had a couple of friends who nursed and pumped for a whole year. And I thought: If they can do it, I can do it.Back to all breastfeeding essays"

Dehydration in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_dehydration-in-babies_11527.bc,"What is dehydration?If your baby's dehydrated, it means that she doesn't have as much fluid in her body as she needs. Babies and children are more prone to dehydration than adults, and it can happen if your baby takes in less fluid than she loses through vomiting, diarrhea, fever, or sweating. Dehydration can be mild and easily corrected, moderate, or severe and life threatening.How can I tell if my baby is dehydrated?Any of these signs could indicate that your baby is dehydrated or is becoming dehydrated:More than six hours without a wet diaperUrine that looks darker and smells stronger than usualLethargyA dry, parched mouth and lipsNo tears while cryingThese signs indicate that your baby may be seriously dehydrated:Sunken eyesHands and feet that feel cold and look splotchyExcessive sleepiness or fussinessSunken fontanels (the soft spots on your baby's head)Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.What should I do if my baby shows signs of dehydration?Babies can quickly become dangerously dehydrated, so if you think your baby shows signs of serious dehydration, take him to the emergency room immediately. He may need to receive liquids through an intravenous (IV) tube until he's rehydrated.Otherwise, give your baby's doctor a call for advice. She may want to see him to make sure he's okay. If she decides that your baby is mildly dehydrated, she may instruct you to give him more fluids. If your baby is younger than 3 months, she will probably suggest sticking with breast milk or formula but offering them more frequently than usual.If your baby is 3 months or older, the doctor may recommend a special liquid  in addition to breast milk or formula  to replenish the water and salts (electrolytes) that his body has lost. Electrolyte liquids are available in most pharmacies. Pedialyte, Infalyte, and ReVital are some of the name-brand products. Ask your pharmacist about generic brands, too.Your baby's doctor can give you instructions for using electrolyte liquids, based on your baby's weight and age, but a general guideline for the amount of total solution he should ingest over the course of three or four hours is 5 teaspoons (25 mL or cc) per pound of your baby's weight. So, for example, if your baby weighs 15 pounds, this would equal 75 teaspoons (375 mL or cc), or about 1 1/2 cups.How can I prevent dehydration?Make sure your baby is drinking plenty of fluids, especially on very hot days and when she's ill. Continue to breastfeed or bottle-feed her and, if she's 6 months or older, you can supplement with a little water  about 4 ounces per day until she's eating solid foods, at which point you can increase the amount. If your baby is younger than 6 months and you're concerned about dehydration, talk with her doctor about giving her small amounts of water.Don't give your baby carbonated sodas, as they're terrible for her teeth and health. If your baby is drinking juice, don't increase the amount of juice she drinks in a day, but you might try diluting it with water. If she's drinking 3 or 4 ounces of juice a day, for example, you could dilute this to 6 or 8 ounces of liquid. (The American Academy of Pediatrics [AAP] recommends limiting your baby's daily juice intake to 4 to 6 ounces per day.)Be especially alert to symptoms of dehydration under these circumstances:Fever. Offer your baby plenty of liquids whenever she has a fever. If she seems to be having trouble swallowing, ask her doctor whether you can give her a pain medication such as children's acetaminophen or (if she's 6 months or older) ibuprofen, to help with the discomfort. (Never give a child aspirin, which is associated with a rare but serious condition called Reye's syndrome.)Overheating. Give your baby more fluids than usual during hot weather. Too much activity on a hot day or just sitting in a stuffy, sweltering room can lead to sweating and fluid loss.Diarrhea. If your baby has an intestinal illness, especially acute gastroenteritis, she'll lose fluid through diarrhea and vomiting. Don't give her fruit juice, which may just make the situation worse, and don't give her over-the-counter diarrhea medicine unless her doctor recommends it.Just encourage your baby to drink extra breast milk or formula, and supplement with a little water once she's 6 months or older. If your baby is 3 months or older and you think she may be becoming dehydrated, you can give her an electrolyte drink as well.By the way, if your baby has dehydration caused by diarrhea, her stools will be loose. If fluid loss from vomiting or another source causes dehydration, she'll have fewer and smaller bowel movements.Vomiting. Viruses and intestinal infections can lead to vomiting. If your baby is having trouble keeping liquids down, she can easily become dehydrated.Try giving her very small amounts of fluid (primarily breast milk or formula as well as a little water if she's 6 months or older) frequently. Electrolyte liquids are helpful for babies 3 months or older who have been vomiting. Start by giving her slow, frequent sips when her tummy settles down  about 1 teaspoon (5 mL or cc) every 10 minutes for a couple of hours. Then, if all goes well, you can increase the amount to 2 teaspoons (10 mL or cc) every five minutes.Refuses to drink. A sore throat or ailment such as hand, foot, and mouth disease can cause so much pain that a baby sometimes stops drinking. Ask your doctor about giving your baby children's acetaminophen or ibuprofen (if she's 6 months or older) to ease the discomfort, and then offer her breast milk or formula and water, frequently and in small quantities.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012.

"Top baby costs, and how to save",https://www.babycenter.com/top-baby-costs,"Raising a baby isn't cheap! (You can check our Baby Costs Calculator to see how it all adds up.) But there are plenty of ways to save money. Below you'll find the top baby expenses moms reported to us, and what you can do about them.1. FormulaCost: $60 to $100 per month""I would have tried harder to breastfeed if I had known just how expensive formula was going to be,"" says one mom. Another, whose son required a pricier brand because of a milk protein allergy, says, ""We spent about $150 a month on formula alone!""Ways to save: Breastfeed for as long as you can. If you're not breastfeeding, stick with powdered formula, which costs less than ready-to-use or liquid concentrate. Buy in bulk at warehouse stores, and sign up to receive coupons on formula manufacturers' websites.Saving vs. Spending (Mom Confidential) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:16Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:16Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

DiapersCost: $30 to $85 per month for disposable diapers""I was surprised by the range in price for diapers depending on where you purchase them  at a supermarket, pharmacy, or superstore,"" says one mom.Ways to save: Using cloth diapers and washing them yourself is making a comeback with many budget-minded parents. One mom, who says she saved $2,000 by going this route, says, ""You'll be surprised by how cute, easy, and convenient cloth diapers are."" If you favor disposable diapers, the best way to save is to buy in bulk at warehouse stores or online. Sign up at diaper manufacturers' websites to get coupons, and stock up when diapers are on sale.First-Year Baby Costs CalculatorCalculate the cost of your baby's first year, including gear, diapers, childcare, and more.3. ChildcareCost: Varies""Babysitting is $10 per hour where we live, and daycare averages $1,000 a month,"" says one mom. ""We constantly feel in a bind financially.""Ways to save: For full-time care, consider asking a relative or friend. Home daycare centers and nanny sharing can also save cash. For occasional babysitting, trade time with a trusted neighbor or friends or hire a responsible student. If possible, try to stagger work schedules with your partner so you can each cover some of your child's care. Finally, consider enrolling in a flexible spending account for childcare expenses if your employer offers one.4. GearCost: Varies""Everything costs about $100,"" says one mom. ""After a while, that seriously adds up!""Ways to save: Create a registry so friends and family members can help with the big purchases. Start with the basics  a good car seat, stroller, and bouncy seat, for example  and wait to buy other things. You may be able to try out a friend's activity center or swing to see if your baby likes it before buying. While it's a good idea to buy your car seat new, ask for other items as hand-me-downs and shop garage sales, community websites, and secondhand stores for other items. ""I wish I'd bought more used gear,"" says one mom. ""It wasn't until my baby was a few months old that I figured out how many moms would love to sell their barely used baby equipment.""5. ClothesCost: $20 to $50 per month""There were times I went out to expensive stores and spent $40 on just one outfit,"" says one mom. ""A couple of weeks later, it wouldn't fit anymore.""Way to save: Many first-time parents find they receive enough gifts to keep their baby clothed for the first few months. After that, ask for hand-me-downs from friends and relatives. Get gently used items from consignment stores, thrift shops, community websites, and garage sales. Look for store sales and online deals. Finally, treat your child's soiled clothes with stain remover or a laundry booster so they can be worn again!6. FoodCost: $50 to $100 per month (after your baby starts solid food)""At one point, my daughter was eating five jars of organic baby food a day at nearly $1 per jar,"" says one mom. ""Baby food is ridiculously expensive,"" says another.Ways to save: If possible, make your own baby food. ""A good quality hand blender will pay for itself in about a month,"" says one mom. You may find that your child likes homemade food better than jarred  and you can often make baby food out of what your family's already eating for dinner. If this doesn't work, clip coupons. ""I know I should make my own, but with three kids, the convenience of buying jars tempts me,"" says one mom. ""Portability and speed are worth something!""7. Toys, books, and DVDsCost: $20 to $40 per month""Some toys are priceless, but you can't know which ones your baby will love,"" says one mom. ""I found that my baby really only loves three toys out of the 20-something I bought,"" says another.Ways to save: Let your child play with safe household items. ""The whisk is a big hit with my little one,"" says one mom. Buy toys secondhand, borrow books from the library, ask friends for hand-me-downs, and consider setting up a toy exchange with friends or neighbors who have babies around the same age."
"How time changes, vacations, and temperament will affect your baby's schedule",https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-time-changes-vacations-and-temperament-will-affect-your_3657539.bc,"Do some babies take to a set schedule more easily than others do?Yes, says pediatrician Cheryl Hausman, medical director of the University City Primary Care Center at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia. Many babies will naturally fall into a predictable eating and sleeping schedule or adapt fairly easily to a parent-led routine. But babies vary in terms of how consistent they are.According to Hausman, this has a lot to do with your baby's individual temperament. ""Some babies like routines and some don't,"" says Hausman. ""All babies aren't going to be able to follow the exact same schedule, but all babies should be able to follow a schedule.""Keep in mind, however, that medical and developmental factors can affect your baby's ability to follow a set routine. For example, premature babies, low-birth-weight babies, and babies with severe reflux may stay asleep for shorter durations and feed more often. Always check with your baby's doctor if you have questions about your baby's schedule.Will a time change disrupt my baby's schedule?Probably. But if you're talking about losing or gaining an hour thanks to daylight-savings time, the adjustment period is typically short-lived. For example, if your baby usually wakes at 7 a.m., you may be dismayed to find her waking at 6 a.m. after the ""fall back"" time change. But wait anywhere from a few days to a week and your baby will likely be back to her later wake-up time. This isn't always true, of course  after the ""spring forward"" change, some babies make the later time their permanent bedtime  so you may have to go with the flow.Still, you can try to avoid the time-change adjustment period by putting your baby to bed 10 to 15 minutes earlier or later, depending on the time of year, for the week leading up to the change. The same advice applies to switching time zones. You can slowly move things back or up, depending on where you're traveling, during the week before your trip. On your return, just reverse the process, and be patient as your baby adjusts her internal clock.One way to help your baby through a bigger time change is to give her cues about when it's daytime and nighttime. So have lots of walks and playtime outdoors during the day, and then quiet things down and lower the lights in the late afternoon or early evening to ready her for sleep. See more expert advice and parent tips on handling time changes.Guide to Firsts: Plane travelPrepare for your baby's first flight with our handy checklist. Will a vacation  even one in the same time zone  mess with my baby's schedule?Not all vacations are schedule-busters. If you're spending the week kicking back in the same time zone, then chances are you'll be able to re-create a lot of the nap, feeding, and play routine you enjoy with your baby at home. The major adjustment for your baby will be getting used to unfamiliar surroundings and a different sleeping place.But if your vacation involves lots of sightseeing and activity, and your baby is napping in her car seat or stroller every day, staying out late, and eating on the go, then you might find it takes her longer to get used to the regular routine once you're back home. Expect her to take anywhere from three days to a week to re-acclimate. Until then, you may have to deal with extra periods of fussiness.Is it easier to get a formula-fed baby on a schedule than a breastfed baby?There's disagreement on whether formula-fed babies sleep for longer stretches than breastfed babies (and whether this means they're more consistent in their schedules). Some doctors say it's a myth: ""It's absolutely not true that formula helps babies sleep better or longer,"" says pediatrician Daniel Levy, president of the Maryland chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics and clinical assistant professor of pediatrics at the University of Maryland. ""When you're careful to empty the breast, the baby will get the hind milk that's heaviest in fat and helps satiate them,"" Levy adds.But author and pediatrician Tanya Remer Altmann points out that while formula and breast milk have the same calories per ounce, breast milk is naturally more digestible and so can travel through a baby's digestive system more quickly. Many parents do report that formula-fed babies go longer stretches between feedings than breastfed babies.Either way, this shouldn't affect your baby's ability to follow a general schedule or a more set, parent-led routine. Is it okay to alter my baby's schedule sometimes, say to take her to an activity that's smack in the middle of naptime?Not a good idea, say most experts. If your baby is missing one or two good hours of sleep that she normally gets each day, she likely won't be in the frame of mind to really enjoy the activity anyway.Plus, you're setting her and yourself up for a challenging afternoon and evening. If it's the morning nap you skip, then your baby may be so overtired that she's hard to settle for a nap when you do get home. If you push that afternoon nap to a later time, she may skip it completely, meaning she'll be completely exhausted and cranky by bedtime. Or, she may crash so hard or start her nap so late that she's not tired when you try to put her down for the night. Of course, you know your baby best, and have to take her patterns into account when weighing these decisions. Some babies will happily settle down for a nap at a different time than usual, while others will be thrown completely off track.And of course, sometimes your baby just has to miss her nap, whether it's because Grandma is in town visiting or it's the only appointment time the pediatrician had available. These once-in-a-while occurrences shouldn't throw her off too much.Read more:Baby schedule basics: Why, when, and how to start a routineHow to create a parent-led, baby-led, or combination scheduleSeven keys to creating a successful baby scheduleSample baby schedules for your child's first yearPoll: What kind of baby schedule works for you?"
My breastfeeding story: Latching trouble and bottle-feeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-latching-trouble-and-bottle-feeding_10414441.bc,"Name: JannaLives in: Puyallup, WABreastfeeding experience: Harder than expectedMain challenges: Trouble latching, slow eater, needed to bottle-feedBreastfed/pumped for: 14 monthsMy storyAmelia was breech at full-term so I had to deliver her via c-section. From day one, we had nursing problems. She had a tongue tie that prevented her from bringing the nipple into her mouth properly, and it probably didn't help that I had inverted nipples. Also her neck and jaw were very tight, so opening her mouth wide was a challenge.Trying to get her to latch on was just so, so hard. From the moment I tried breastfeeding, the hospital staff knew it wasn't going to be easy for me. I was frustrated. I had taken a breastfeeding class before giving birth, and I had read that it could be a challenging process, so I was prepared for that. But I didn't think it would be as bad as it was. I would cry and I felt so helpless. It was devastating as a new mom who just wanted to feed her baby.And I was really against giving my child formula. There's nothing wrong with formula, but I didn't personally want to use it. I supplemented with formula the first week for about 75 percent of feedings, but once we got going, she was exclusively on breast milk.For about six weeks, I worked on breastfeeding. I pumped too. We saw specialists to get Amelia's tongue tie clipped (and then re-clipped  it had to be redone). I saw so many lactation consultants  maybe two in the hospital, three or four in the clinic  because I really wanted to find a solution. And they said, ""Yes, you absolutely can get over these hurdles.""I nursed her for about three months, but I really struggled. She was a slow eater and sometimes she'd feed for 45 minutes. I basically felt like I couldn't go out because I didn't feel comfortable being out and nursing her  not out of modesty but because of logistics and comfort.So I decided to switch to the bottle. She could eat faster that way. I was okay with it  I was a little sad because I worked so hard to get her to breastfeed, but I felt like I had two choices: Wean and use formula, or wean her from the breast and feed her pumped breast milk by bottle. I'm just not a fan of formula  you always hear breast is best, and I didn't want her to be on processed food. So I chose to pump and bottle-feed.My body responded well to pumping; I made enough for her. I did that until she was 14 months old, then transitioned her to cow's milk.My biggest lesson learnedYou can prepare as much as possible and go to breastfeeding classes, but once you start breastfeeding, your child may not be a textbook case, and you might still be searching for answers.

Sample baby schedules for 7- and 8-month-olds,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sample-baby-schedules-for-7-and-8-month-olds_3657236.bc,"Getting into a routine with your baby is a personal thing. You'll learn to read your baby's cues to develop a pattern of eating, sleeping, and playing that meets your little one's needs and works for your family.That said, it can be a big help to see what other moms and dads are doing. We asked parents of 7- and 8-month-olds to share their baby's daily schedule, then picked the eight below as a helpful representation.As you're creating a schedule for your baby, keep in mind that at 7 and 8 months most babies need:Solid foods two to three times a day, plus about 24 to 32 ounces of breast milk or formula in a 24-hour period. (Get specific tips on how to tell whether your baby is getting enough breast milk or formula.) Now's the time to start increasing the amount and variety of your baby's foods and to introduce finger foods and perhaps a sippy cup.About 14 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period  this includes nighttime sleep and naps.

Sample baby schedules for 5- and 6-month-olds,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sample-baby-schedules-for-5-and-6-month-olds_3657233.bc,"Getting into a routine with your baby is a personal thing. You'll learn to read your baby's cues to develop a pattern of eating, sleeping, and playing that meets your little one's needs and works for your family.That said, it can be a big help to see what other moms and dads are doing. We asked parents of 5- and 6-month-olds to share their baby's daily schedule, then picked the eight below as a helpful representation.As you're creating a schedule for your baby, keep in mind that at 5 and 6 months most babies need:Up to 32 ounces of breast milk or formula in a 24-hour period. (Get specific tips on how to tell whether your baby is getting enough breast milk or formula.) Most babies start solid foods at this age, though they'll still get most of their nutrition from breast milk or formula.About 14 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period  this includes nighttime sleep and naps. Two naps during the day (morning and afternoon) is typical, though many babies will still take three naps. Read more about sleep needs at this age.Time for playing, developing important muscles, working on new skills, and interacting with you. Try reading to your little one, giving your baby a massage, or going for a stroller walk.Baby massage: Strengthening Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 3:17Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -3:17Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosSchedule 1: A breastfeeding attachment-parenting mom of a 6-month-oldEditor's note: This schedule is a baby-led routine6 to 8 a.m.: Piper (who sleeps with me) moves around without waking, and I nurse her or pat her and she continues to sleep.8 to 9 a.m.: I kiss Piper awake and we snuggle in the bed for a few minutes. I take off her diaper and pj's and give her a T-shirt or short dress. I sign ""potty"" and we go to the living room so she can pee in her little potty. (We're doing infant potty training.)9 to 10 a.m.: Piper plays on the floor wearing a cloth diaper or without a diaper (I put waterproof pads over the rug). She squeals at the cat and I show her the signs for ""cat"" and the things she's playing with. I've only been trying baby signing for a week.10 a.m.: Nurse and nap. She usually sleeps about 45 minutes in her bassinet in our bedroom. I prep things for our day and maybe grab a few minutes on the computer. When Piper wakes, I dress her and put her in a disposable diaper. She gets more time on the floor with toys and books and maybe a Mister Rogers record.11:15 a.m.: One more try on the potty, and I slide Piper into the sling, shoulder my bag, and head for the bus. Piper likes to look around as we walk, and she insists on coming out of the sling for at least part of the bus ride. She smiles at everyone and gets a lot of attention. It must take a lot of energy, because she usually wants to take another short nap toward the end of the bus ride and while we walk the four blocks from the bus to work. On the days we don't work, we hit the park or the library or run errands that we can do on foot.Baby sleep: Tips for napping Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:07Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:07Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all baby videosNoon: Greet the teenagers I'm babysitting and offer them lunch. I give Piper a chance to use the potty. I feed the kids, we play cards or video games, and Piper ""helps"" or plays on the floor with the toys we keep there. Every time someone wins or makes a good play, they tell Piper about it at high volume and she laughs and kicks.2 p.m.: Piper's laughter starts getting that hysterical edge, and we break off for nursing and a nap. She sleeps in a Moses basket in the laundry room for about 40 minutes, and then gets up for more play. We go outside to watch the turtle or the kids playing basketball. If she seems clingy, I'll carry her around in the sling so she can see everything but doesn't have to interact unless she wants to.5 to 6 p.m.: I make dinner for the kids, depending on when their parents are coming home, and Piper and I nurse again, then head home or to a friend's house on the bus. Piper often takes a little nap while we're walking, and she doesn't always need to get out of the sling when we're on the bus going back. On the days we don't work, she naps sometime between 4 and 5 p.m.6:30 to 7 p.m.: We get home, and I'm pretty tired. Piper gets to spend some time with Daddy or in a bouncer while I make dinner. Sometimes she's tired at 7 p.m., but I know if I put her to bed that early she won't sleep through the night. Sometimes Piper tries some mashed-up fruits or veggies, depending on what we're eating. I keep giving her tiny bites of food as long as she seems interested.9 p.m.: Dress for bed, nurse in the papasan chair or in bed, and I place Piper asleep in the bassinet (she's really outgrowing it, but I haven't figured out the physics of getting a crib into our postage-stamp-size bedroom yet). She fusses about every 40 minutes, and I pat or nurse her back to sleep. I'm careful to get lots of help from my husband at night or to go to bed early because I'm not my best self when I'm overtired. After I put Piper to bed is when I'm most likely to feel overwhelmed by household responsibilities, but in the morning they're easily managed.9:30 to 11 p.m.: I take Piper into bed with me when I go to bed. She nurses again and then usually sleeps soundly until 6 a.m. But sometimes she's fitful and needs comfort every hour. There really isn't an in-between. Schedule 2: A formula-feeding stay-at-home mom of 6-month-old twins and an older childEditor's note: This schedule is a parent-led routine7 a.m.: First baby wakes up and drinks 6 to 8 ounces of formula, then relaxes in the swing.7 to 7:30 a.m.: Big brother wakes up and entertains.8 a.m.: Second baby drinks 6 to 8 ounces of formula and relaxes in our other swing.

How to buy bottles and nipples,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-buy-bottles-and-nipples_751.bc,"The lowdown on bottles and nipplesWhen it comes to babies and bottles, theres no formula for success. Some babies will take any bottle with a smile. Some take to a particular type of nipple or bottle and outright refuse a different brand. And some babies have less colic, gas, and spit-up with certain bottles. (Many bottles are designed to prevent these feeding problems by venting air from the more effectively.)You may also find that your baby doesn't have a preference, but you probably will if, say, a particular brand of bottles and nipples leaks or has too many little parts to clean.To start, buy or register for a small selection of bottles and nipples  either a few different bottle and nipple combinations or 2 different brands of newborn starter sets. Ask friends which brands they recommend, and check reviews online.To make it easier to transition a breastfed baby to a bottle, manufacturers have designed various types of bottles and nipples to mimic the feel of nursing.

See all videosSee which bottles parents liked best in BabyCenters Moms Picks awards.What to look for when buyingBottlesBottle material: Glass, silicone, plastic, and stainless steel are the most common materials.Plastic is light, ubiquitous, shatterproof and inexpensive, but parents worry about chemicals even in BPA-free plastic (read more about BPA in Important Safety Notes, below). Plastic bottles also deteriorate, so they need to be replaced regularly.Glass is heavy and can shatter (you can buy silicone sleeves that go over glass bottles to prevent this), but its BPA-free. Glass bottles are sold widely and last longer than plastic ones but are more expensive.Silicone bottles are light, unbreakable, BPA-free, and often soft but more expensive than plastic and glass. Often silicone bottles arent sold in drugstores or grocery stores, which can be inconvenient if a nipple cracks or breaks and you need a quick replacement.Stainless steel is light, unbreakable, BPA-free, and lasts for a long time, but like silicone, these bottles can be expensive and hard to find.Bottle shape: Bottles come in a wide variety of shapes. Traditional ones are tall and slightly curved or angled. Many bottles on the market claim to be easier for babies to hold, have an ergonomic design, or angled necks to make them easier for you to hold. Wide-necked bottles may make measuring formula easier; they may also not fit into drink-holders on strollers or in cars.Disposables: Bottles with drop-in plastic inserts filled with formula or breast milk can be handy while on the go and are easy to clean: just toss the liner and wash the nipple. Each insert can be used only once.Venting systems: Many bottles are marketed as preventing colic; they may have straw-like components that fit into your bottle to prevent your baby from ingesting gas-causing air bubbles, or may have venting systems built into the nipple or bottom of the bottle. The jurys still out on whether these systems work, but many parents firmly believe they do.Size and number: The number of bottles you'll need to own can range from about 4 to 12, depending on whether you'll primarily be bottle-feeding or breastfeeding. Start with 4-ounce bottles. They're perfect for the small amounts of breast milk or formula newborns eat in one sitting. Shift to 8- or 9-ounce bottles at about 4 months, or whenever your baby's growing appetite makes bigger bottles more practical.NipplesNipple material: Nipples generally come in either latex or silicone varieties. Latex nipples are softer and more flexible, but they don't last as long and some babies are allergic to them. Silicone nipples are firmer and hold their shape longer.Nipple shape: Traditional nipples are shaped like a bell or dome. Orthodontic nipples, designed to accommodate your child's palate and gums, have a bulb that's flat on the side and rests on your child's tongue. Flat-topped nipples and wide nipples (used with wide bottles) are said to feel more like Mom's breast and may be a good bet if you plan to switch between breastfeeding and bottle-feeding.Size and flow: Nipples come in a range of sizes and flow speeds, from slow to fast. Preemies and newborns usually need the smallest size (often called ""stage 1""), which has the slowest flow. Babies graduate to larger sizes and a faster flow as they get older, can suck more effectively, and drink more breast milk or formula.Nipples are marked with the size and a suggested age range. Don't be concerned if your baby doesn't follow these guidelines exactly. You may have to try a few different nipple sizes to find one that works best for your baby. Watch to make sure your baby isn't having a hard time getting milk or getting so much that he's choking or spitting up. And, of course, discuss any feeding concerns with your baby's doctor.Disposables: Disposable nipples can come in handy when you're traveling or on the go. These are sold prepackaged and sterilized, so they're convenient to pop on a bottle. But they have to be tossed after one use.FYI! Breast milk or formula should drip steadily out of the nipple, not pour out in a stream. This can happen if the flow is too fast for your baby, or if you've been using a nipple for a while and the hole has cracked and gotten larger. Find out more signs it's time to replace nipples and bottles.AccessoriesMany parents find that bottle warmers, insulated tote bags, bottle-drying racks, and dishwasher baskets that hold bottle parts are helpful to have.Important safety notesConcerns about chemicals in plastic baby bottles  particularly the chemical bisphenol A (BPA)  have driven a renewed interest in glass bottles, as well as sales of alternative materials like silicone and stainless steel. In 2012 the U.S. Food and Drug Administration banned BPA in the manufacture of all baby bottles.Though research on BPA continues, the American Academy of Pediatricians recommends parents take precautionary methods to reduce BPA exposure:Avoid clear-plastic baby bottles or containers with the recycling number 7 and the letters PC imprinted on them. Many contain BPA.Consider using certified or identified BPA-free plastic bottles.Use bottles made of opaque plastic. These bottles (made of polyethylene or polypropylene) do not contain BPA. You can also look for the recycle symbols with the number 2 or 5 in them.Because heat may cause the release of BPA from plastic, do not boil polycarbonate bottles, heat them in the microwave, or wash them in the dishwasher.Inspect bottles regularly to make sure theyre free of cracks that can harbor bacteria. Sticky or discolored nipples can be a sign of deterioration, while cracked nipples can be bitten or chewed off to become a choking hazard.Baby-bottle recalls are infrequent but do occur. Use BabyCenters Product Recall Finder to see if your bottles have been the subject of a recall.What it's going to cost youTraditional glass and plastic bottles range from about $4 to more than $10 apiece. Stainless-steel baby bottles range from $13 to $30. Silicone and latex nipples range from $1 to $7 each (but are usually sold in packages of 2 or 3).Starter sets and gift sets, which include several bottles and nipples, as well as accessories like cleaning brushes and sterilizers, run from about $15 to $130.Guides and downloadsGuide to firsts: Giving your baby a bottleDownload: Illustrated guide to buying bottles and nipplesMoms' Picks: Best baby bottlesShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Traveling with a newborn to 8-month-old,https://www.babycenter.com/0_traveling-with-a-newborn-to-8-month-old_7157.bc,"You'll probably want to stick pretty close to home for the first few months after your baby's born. Between feedings and diaper changes, a new baby requires almost nonstop attention, and the risk of a newborn catching something while traveling is too great. Besides, you'll probably be exhausted.But infants aren't as fragile as parents sometimes fear. And by age 3 months or so, babies are pretty good candidates for travel, as long as the trip is low-key.Your baby's less likely to view travel as a disruption now than later on. He also can't run around yet and get into trouble. So enjoy this time because once he starts scampering about, travel becomes a far greater challenge. Here are some travel tips to get you started:Guide to Firsts: Plane travelPrepare for your baby's first flight with our handy checklist.Health and safetyAssemble a first-aid kit with the supplies you might need to deal with minor medical problems while on the road with your baby. Don't forget prescription medications, even if your baby only needs them on occasion. (It's always when you leave the asthma medicine at home that your child has an asthma attack at Grandma's.)Fill out an emergency sheet with your child's health information or save it on your phone. Include the contact names and numbers of healthcare providers and a list of any allergies your child has or medications he takes. That way, everything is in one place if you need it.Bring a hat to shade your baby from the sun in warm weather or keep him warm in cool weather.Sunscreen is a must if you'll be spending time outdoors  no matter what season. Use one with both UVA and UVB protection that's at least SPF 15. (Sunscreen with SPF 30 is even better, especially for babies who have fair skin.) If your baby is younger than 6 months, apply small amounts of sunscreen to his face and the backs of his hands. On older babies, you can use it more liberally wherever skin is exposed. If you're using an aerosol sunscreen, be sure not to spray it near your baby's face. Spray some on your own hands first, then gently rub it on.In the car, your baby should always ride in the back seat, in a rear-facing car seat  never in a front seat with (or without) a passenger air bag. If your car's equipped with top and bottom anchors for your child's safety seat, the middle of the car's back seat is the safest place to install it.Before you leave on your trip, make sure the car seat is properly installed and the car seat's belts are correctly threaded. Adjust the harness so it fits your baby snugly and securely.Get removable shade screens for the car's side windows  available at baby supply and discount stores  to shield your baby's eyes from the sun and keep him from getting too hot. Peel-and-stick shades are more secure, and therefore safer, than those that attach with suction cups.Bring a car seat when you take public transit (like a bus, train, or taxi) to keep your baby as safe as possible. The car seat will provide some protection even when there's no way to secure it in place.If you've purchased an airplane seat for your baby, bring an FAA-approved car seat for your child. This is the safest way for babies to fly. If you didn't buy a ticket for your baby, you might get lucky and be able to use the car seat if there are empty seats on board. (For more about flying with a young child, see our list of questions to ask your airline ahead of time.)If your baby's ears seem to hurt from air pressure changes during takeoff and landing, encourage him to breastfeed or suck on a bottle, pacifier, or sippy cup. If your baby's strapped into a car seat, give him something to suck on while in his seat rather than take him out to breastfeed him. It's safest for both of you to be securely buckled in.Keep in mind that not all babies experience ear pain, so use your judgment. If your baby's sleeping soundly, leave him be and he might get through the takeoff or landing without any trouble. He'll wake up from the discomfort if he's bothered.If you're crossing time zones and are worried about upsetting your baby's schedule, take steps to fight jet lag. Try shifting your baby's sleep schedule over a few days leading up to your departure and exposing him to sunlight once you reach your destination. You may also want to keep the same schedule in the new time zone if that works best for you.Whatever you choose to do, plan it out ahead of time and try not to overschedule the first few days of your trip  you can't predict how disrupted your baby's rhythms might be. If you're traveling by plane for the first time with your baby, it's a good idea to check out the travel tips from the Transportation Security Administration. Food and comfortPack an extra water bottle or thermos to stay well hydrated, especially if you're breastfeeding. If you're flying, fill an empty bottle at a water fountain or buy something to drink after you go through security.If you're not breastfeeding, bring ready-to-use formula or make a few bottles of formula at home to bring along. If you're traveling by plane, review the policies for bringing formula on board and hand the formula to security officers when you go through screening. You don't need to put bottles of formula into the standard quart-size zip-top bag, and you aren't limited to 3.4-ounce bottles. Security officers may ask to test or screen the formula, however.If your baby has started on solids, bring only as much baby food as you'll need for the trip. You can always buy more once you reach your destination. (Exception: If you're traveling internationally or to a place where it might be tough to find what you need, it may be less of a headache to pack a full supply of food.)Also helpful if your baby is eating solids: Bring a bib that's large enough to cover most of her outfit, has a plastic or waterproof coating (so it can be easily wiped off), and can be folded or rolled for easy packing.Bring enough diapers for the trip (or enough to last until you reach your destination and can buy more). It's a good idea to pack a few extra diapers in case of travel delays. Also pack trash bags for dirty diapers and diaper rash lotion. Diaper covers provide added insurance against leaks.Pack at least one extra change of clothes for yourself and your baby. Store them someplace that's easily accessible, like in your carry-on bag. You never know when a diaper leak, spit-up, or other mess might require a change of clothes.Travel with a blanket so that when you're in a park, a motel, or an airport, you can offer your baby a nice spot to lie down, crawl, roll, or otherwise stretch her little limbs.EntertainmentBring a goody bag containing a few of your baby's favorite toys, plus some surprises. Possibilities include nesting toys, babyproof mirrors, rattles, musical toys, soft animals, pop-up toys, plastic keys, and teething rings. Only take a handful to make packing easier.Travel gearTuck a travel-friendly changing pad in your diaper bag to use in public or airplane bathrooms.Stash some large, resealable plastic bags in your car trunk or diaper bag. They're a simple solution for temporarily storing messy items like dirty diapers, clothes, and bibs.Check the height and weight limits for your particular car seat: If you need both a car seat and stroller for your trip, and your baby is still small enough for an infant car seat, a stroller or frame that can carry the car seat cuts down on the gear you have to lug. It also saves you the hassle of getting in and out of cars and airplanes when you can move your sleeping babe from the car to the restaurant without disturbing him.A lightweight stroller (sometimes called an umbrella stroller) makes sense for babies who can sit up. It isn't as cushy as a larger stroller, but it's easy to travel with because it's lightweight and compact. You may be able to check your stroller at the gate and have it ready and waiting for you at your destination. Be sure to check your airline's policy before your trip.Front-carriers or slings are great for carting around younger, lighter babies, while keeping your hands free. Baby backpacks do the trick for heavier kids who can sit up on their own.If you'll be staying in a hotel or motel, request a crib when you make your room reservation or you may be out of luck when you arrive. Inspect it carefully to make sure it's safe and in good condition before using it. Another option: Rent equipment or bring along your own portacrib, play yard, or portable bed.A portable play yard makes an instant, child-safe area that you can plunk down in relatives' homes, hotels, or other places that may not be childproofed.Have an older baby or young toddler?

How breastfeeding benefits you and your baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-breastfeeding-benefits-you-and-your-baby_8910.bc,"Breast milk is best for your baby, and the benefits of breastfeeding extend well beyond basic nutrition. In addition to containing all the vitamins and nutrients your baby needs in the first six months of life, breast milk is packed with disease-fighting substances that protect your baby from illness.That's one reason the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months (although any amount of breastfeeding is beneficial). And scientific studies have shown that breastfeeding is good for your health, too.Here's a look at some of the most important benefits breastfeeding offers you and your baby.Breastfeeding protects your baby from a long list of illnessesNumerous studies from around the world have shown that stomach viruses, lower respiratory illnesses, ear infections, and meningitis occur less often in breastfed babies and are less severe when they do happen. Exclusive breastfeeding (meaning no solid food, formula, or water) for at least six months seems to offer the most protection.Breastfeeding lessons learned: 5 things I never knew Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 6:21Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -6:21Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

This modal can be closed by pressing the Escape key or activating the close button.Breastfeeding isn't always blissful, especially not at first. A filmmaker and mother of two shares what she wants new moms to know. See all baby videosOne large study by the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences showed that children who are breastfed have a 20 percent lower risk of dying between the ages of 28 days and 1 year than children who weren't breastfed, with longer breastfeeding associated with lower risk.The main immune factor at work here is a substance called secretory immunoglobulin A (IgA) that's present in large amounts in colostrum, the first milk your body produces for your baby. (Secretory IgA is present in lower concentrations in mature breast milk.) The substance guards against invading germs by forming a protective layer on the mucous membranes in your baby's intestines, nose, and throat.Your breast milk is specifically tailored to your baby. Your body responds to pathogens (virus and bacteria) that are in your body and makes secretory IgA that's specific to those pathogens, creating protection for your baby based on whatever you're exposed to.Breastfeeding's protection against illness lasts beyond your baby's breastfeeding stage, too. Studies have shown that breastfeeding can reduce a child's risk of developing certain childhood cancers. Scientists don't know exactly how breast milk reduces the risk, but they think antibodies in breast milk may give a baby's immune system a boost.Breastfeeding may also help children avoid a host of diseases that strike later in life, such as type 1 and type 2 diabetes, high cholesterol, and inflammatory bowel disease. In fact, preemies given breast milk as babies are less likely to have high blood pressure by the time they're teenagers.For babies who aren't breastfed, researchers have documented a link between lack of breastfeeding and later development of Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.Breastfeeding can protect your baby from developing allergiesBabies who are fed a formula based on cow's milk or soy tend to have more allergic reactions than breastfed babies.Scientists think that immune factors such as secretory IgA (only available in breast milk) help prevent allergic reactions to food by providing a layer of protection to a baby's intestinal tract. Without this protection, inflammation can develop and the wall of the intestine can become ""leaky."" This allows undigested proteins to cross the gut where they can cause an allergic reaction and other health problems.Babies who are fed formula rather than breast milk don't get this layer of protection, so they're more vulnerable to inflammation, allergies, and other eventual health issues. Breastfeeding may boost your child's intelligenceVarious researchers have found a connection between breastfeeding and cognitive development. In a study of more than 17,000 infants followed from birth to 6 1/2 years, researchers concluded from IQ scores and other intelligence tests that prolonged and exclusive breastfeeding significantly improves cognitive development.Another study of almost 4,000 children showed that babies who were breastfed had significantly higher scores on a vocabulary test at 5 years of age than children who were not breastfed. And the scores were higher the longer they had been nursed.Preterm infants with extremely low birth weight who received breast milk shortly after birth improved their mental development scores at 18 months when compared with preterm infants who weren't given breast milk. In a later study, researchers found that the higher scores held at 30 months, and that the babies who received breast milk were also less likely to be hospitalized again because of respiratory infections.Experts say that the emotional bonding that takes place during breastfeeding probably contributes to some of the brainpower benefits, but that the fatty acids in breast milk may play the biggest role.Breastfeeding may protect your child from obesityThe American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding as a way to help reduce your child's risk of becoming overweight or obese. An analysis of 17 studies published in the American Journal of Epidemiology shows that breastfeeding reduces a child's risk of becoming overweight as a teen or adult. The strongest effect is in children who were exclusively breastfed, and the longer the baby was breastfed the stronger the link.Experts think that breastfeeding may affect later weight gain for several reasons:Breastfed babies are better at eating until their hunger is satisfied, leading to healthier eating patterns as they grow.Breast milk contains less insulin than formula. (Insulin stimulates the creation of fat.)Breastfed babies have more leptin in their system, a hormone that researchers believe plays a role in regulating appetite and fat.Compared with breastfed babies, formula-fed infants gain weight more rapidly in the first weeks of life. This rapid weight gain is associated with later obesity.Breastfeeding may lower your baby's risk of SIDSA large German study published in 2009 found that breastfeeding  either exclusively or partially  is associated with a lower risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). The researchers concluded that exclusive breastfeeding at 1 month of age cut the risk of SIDS in half.The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends breastfeeding for as long as possible to reduce the risk of SIDS. Breastfeeding can reduce your stress level and your risk of postpartum depressionThe National Institutes of Health reviewed more than 9,000 study abstracts and concluded that women who didn't breastfeed or who stopped breastfeeding early on had a higher risk of postpartum depression.Many women report feeling relaxed while breastfeeding. That's because nursing triggers the release of the hormone oxytocin. Numerous studies in animals and humans have found that oxytocin promotes nurturing and relaxation. (Oxytocin released while nursing also helps your uterus contract after birth, resulting in less postpartum bleeding.)One study found that women who had high amounts of oxytocin in their system (50 percent of breastfeeding moms as opposed to 8 percent of bottle-feeding moms) had lower blood pressure after being asked to talk about a stressful personal problem.By the way, if you're being treated for depression, you can still breastfeed your baby. Your healthcare practitioner can help you identify safe ways to treat your depression while nursing.Breastfeeding may reduce your risk of some types of cancerNumerous studies have found that the longer women breastfeed, the more they're protected against breast and ovarian cancer. For breast cancer, nursing for at least a year appears to have the most protective effect.It's not entirely clear how breastfeeding helps, but it may have to do with the structural changes in breast tissue caused by breastfeeding and the fact that lactation suppresses the amount of estrogen your body produces. Researchers think the effect on ovarian cancer may be related to estrogen suppression as well.More informationStudies are finding new benefits of breastfeeding all the time. The May 2010 issue of Pediatrics, for example, published a study showing that babies who are breastfed are less likely to have fevers after their immunizations than babies who are formula fed.Breastfeeding is natural  but that doesn't necessarily mean it's easy. Don't hesitate to contact your healthcare provider or a certified lactation consultant if you need help or support.You can also get help from our Breastfeeding Problem Solver, ask questions in our Breastfeeding support and help group, and learn more about breastfeeding basics, including ways to hold your baby while breastfeeding.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a.

Cow's milk: When and how to introduce it,https://www.babycenter.com/0_cows-milk-when-and-how-to-introduce-it_1334703.bc,"Why should I wait until my baby is at least 12 months old to introduce cow's milk?Babies can't digest cow's milk as completely or easily as breast milk or formula. Cow's milk contains high concentrations of protein and minerals, which can tax your baby's immature kidneys.Cow's milk doesn't have the right amounts of iron, vitamin C, and other nutrients for infants. It may even cause iron-deficiency anemia in some babies, since cow's milk protein can irritate the lining of the digestive system, leading to blood in the stools. Finally, cow's milk doesn't provide the healthiest types of fat for growing babies.However, once your child's ready to digest it, dairy milk can supplement a balanced diet of solid foods that include cereals, vegetables, fruits and meats.Why should my child start drinking cow's milk?Milk is a rich source of calcium, which builds strong bones and teeth and helps regulate blood clotting and muscle control. It's also one of the few sources of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium and is crucial for bone growth. (Almost all milk in the United States is fortified with vitamin D.)Milk also provides protein for growth, and carbohydrates to give your child the energy he needs all day. And if your child gets enough calcium from the get-go, there's evidence that he'll have a lower risk of high blood pressure, stroke, colon cancer, and hip fractures later in life.Feeding timeline: Your child's development Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:14Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:14Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all baby videosDo I need to stop breastfeeding when my child starts drinking cow's milk?There's no need to wean your child after you introduce cow's milk. As long as you both enjoy breastfeeding, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) says it's fine to continue breastfeeding past your child's first birthday.How much milk should my toddler drink?According to the AAP, your 1-year-old can get enough calcium and vitamin D from 8 to 12 ounces (1 to 1 1/2 cups) of cow's milk  or the equivalent amount of other milk products, like yogurt or cheese. By age 2, your child should get 16 ounces, or 2 cups, of cow's milk or other milk products each day.However, don't give your child more than 32 ounces (4 cups) of milk a day or she may not have room for the other foods she needs to round out her diet. If your toddler's still thirsty, offer water. Can I give my toddler fat-free or reduced-fat milk?In most cases, not yet. The AAP recommends giving whole milk to 1-year-olds unless they're at high risk for obesity. Children this age need the higher fat content of whole milk to maintain normal weight gain and to help the body absorb vitamins A and D. The concentration of protein and minerals in nonfat milk is also too high for children this age. Once your child turns 2, you may decide to switch him to reduced-fat or nonfat milk as long as he's growing well.Possible exceptions: Your child's doctor may recommend giving your child reduced-fat milk (2 percent) after age 1 if you're overweight or obese, or have a family history of obesity, high cholesterol, or cardiovascular disease.My toddler doesn't seem to want cow's milk. How can I get her to try it?Some toddlers take to cow's milk right away, but others are hesitant to make the switch because it has a different texture, taste, and even temperature than breast milk.If that's the case for your toddler, try mixing cow's milk with some breast milk or formula at first. (Try one part milk to three parts of breast milk or formula.) Then slowly shift the ratio until she's drinking 100 percent milk. It may also help to serve cow's milk at room temperature.It can be a challenge to meet the nutritional recommendations for milk or milk products if your child doesn't care for them. But there are many ways to include these in your child's diet. For example:Add milk to her cereal.Serve yogurt, cottage cheese, pudding, custard, or shakes for snacks.Make soup with milk instead of water.Add a milk-based sauce or gravy to casseroles.What if my child can't tolerate milk or can't have it because we're vegans?Regardless of the reason your child doesn't get calcium and vitamin D from milk and other dairy products, your pediatrician will probably recommend either fortified soy milk or calcium and vitamin D supplements.Should I buy organic or hormone-free milk for my child?There's no conclusive evidence that these kinds of milk are better for children, but there's no harm in them. (Organic milk does tend to be more expensive.) Read up on growth hormones in milk and organic foods to help you make a decision.However, the AAP warns against giving your child ""raw"" or unpasteurized milk, though. Without pasteurization, milk may contain harmful bacteria or parasites that can cause serious health problems.Could my child have a milk allergy?If your child drank cow's-milk-based formula as a baby without any problems, you can rest assured that he'll have no problem tolerating regular cow's milk. Even babies who were exclusively breastfed for the first year can usually handle regular cow's milk because they've been exposed to cow's milk protein in breast milk (unless you avoided all dairy).If your child drank soy formula because your doctor recommended it, check with your doctor before introducing cow's milk. Your doctor may recommend that you start with a soy beverage that's been fortified with vitamin D and calcium. (See what our experts say about giving soy milk or rice milk to a child who won't drink cow's milk.)If your child drank soy formula because your doctor recommended it, though, check with your doctor before introducing cow's milk. Your doctor may recommend that you start with a soy beverage that's been fortified with vitamin D and calcium. (See what our experts say about giving soy milk or rice milk to a child who won't drink cow's milk.)But true allergies to cow's milk are relatively uncommon: Only 2 to 3 percent of infants are allergic to milk, according to the AAP, and almost all of them outgrow it. (Learn the difference between a milk allergy and lactose intolerance.) The main symptoms of milk allergy are:Rashes or hives, especially around the mouth or chinAbdominal discomfortDiarrheaVomitingSwellingItchinessAnd chronic nasal stuffiness, a runny nose, cough, wheezing, or breathing difficulties could all be signs that a milk allergy is affecting your child's respiratory system. If your toddler develops any of these symptoms, talk with his doctor.Take your child to his healthcare provider or to the nearest emergency room immediately if he:Is extremely pale or weakHas hives all over his bodyDevelops swelling in the head or neckHas bloody diarrheaHe may be having a life-threatening allergic reaction.If it turns out that your toddler is allergic to cow's milk, you'll want to be careful to avoid foods such as cottage cheese, condensed or evaporated milk, ice cream, yogurt, margarine that contains milk, butter, milk chocolate, and powdered milk. Thanks to a law passed in 2004, all allergens must be clearly marked on food products. In this case, the label will say ""milk.""Learn more:10 nutrients every child needsShould I monitor how much fat my child eats?Best and worst drinks for thirsty kidsShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Six reasons moms wean before they're really ready,https://www.babycenter.com/0_six-reasons-moms-wean-before-theyre-really-ready_8495.bc,"Everyone has an opinion about the ""right"" time to stop nursing, but weaning is an individual decision influenced by cultural norms, personal health issues, and family circumstances. Undoubtedly, some people in your life will say you've waited too long to make the transition from breast to bottle or cup, while others will question your decision to stop if you do so before the recommended one year. Here are six reasons that many nursing moms wean before they're ready and some ideas on how to stick with it.Breastfeeding hurts. I just don't think I can keep this up for a whole year.The first few weeks of breastfeeding can be difficult, especially if your newborn isn't latching on correctly. Figuring out the most comfortable holding position can take time too, adding to your overall discomfort. Have a lactation consultant come by to show you the ropes. While your baby will be nursing around the clock now, he'll start cutting back as he gets older. Many women find the first few weeks of breastfeeding tough, but those who persevere are glad they did.Learn more about surviving the first six weeks.I feel tied down by breastfeeding. I want my old life back.We hate to break it to you, but you'll never be the person you were before you had a child, whether you breastfeed or not. Yes, nursing your child is a commitment and it's common to feel trapped by your baby's constant demands. This can be particularly hard if you're used to being on the go all the time and in control of all aspects of your life. Try looking at breastfeeding as a rare opportunity to take a break from the fast track and bond with your child. Breastfeeding isn't forever, and you might be surprised at how fulfilling the experience can be.Learn more about adjusting to the breastfeeding life.My husband resents all the time I spend nursing.It's perfectly normal for your husband to feel left out of the breastfeeding equation, and to worry that your breasts are now off-limits. You can help him feel involved by letting him bottle-feed your child with pumped breast milk and encouraging him to spend lots time snuggling with the baby. Need more ideas? Read a dad's perspective on breastfeeding.Education and communication are also critical to winning your husband's support. Talk to him about the benefits of breastfeeding. These breastfeeding days will be gone before you know it, and you'll never be able to replace the vitamins and nutrients your child has missed out on. If your husband thinks formula is the way to go, remind him that formula is expensive and takes longer to prepare.Learn other ways to include your partner in breastfeeding.I'm at work all day and there's no place to pump privately.There's no question that working moms have their work cut out for them. The trend away from individual offices with doors to cubicles and common space in the workplace means no one has any privacy any more. But more women in the workplace means more employers are starting to accommodate nursing mothers. Talk to your boss or your human resources manager about your needs. It could be as easy as putting a chair or table in the company restroom, or getting permission to head out to your car a few times a day to pump.There's no easy solution if your workload leaves you crunched for time, or your work environment doesn't allow for pumping. You might also consider breastfeeding only in the morning and evening  your body can adjust to this schedule.See how other moms combined work and breastfeeding.No one else I know is still breastfeeding her baby.Are you a follower or a leader? Although it can be lonely being the only mother in a playgroup still nursing her baby, the scientific evidence is overwhelmingly in your favor. Good friends shouldn't give you a hard time. And those who do might need to be gently reminded of all the health benefits associated with breastfeeding, for you and your child.Find out how to make extended breastfeeding work for you.My mother thinks I'm coddling my child by continuing to breastfeed.The post-World War II formula-feeding generation frowned on breastfeeding. A lot has changed since then. Research has shown not only that breast milk boosts your baby's immune system, but that breastfeeding a child for a year or more doesn't lead to an overly dependent or clingy child; rather, it fosters independence and self-confidence. All toddlers are clingy to some degree. Breastfeeding can be a great source of comfort and reassurance as your child moves from one developmental phase to another, says Kathleen Huggins, BabyCenter's breastfeeding expert and author of The Nursing Mother's Companion."
How to care for your twin or multiple preemies in the NICU,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-care-for-your-twin-or-multiple-preemies-in-the-nicu_10300015.bc,"If you have more than one baby,you have the added challenge of getting to know each infant's needs and personality. Even in the NICU, your babies can show differences in their medical needs, preferences, how they respond to their surroundings, and what they need from you.For instance, one baby might prefer a light touch, while another prefers a firm hold. One baby might sleep calmly through sudden noises, while the other startles and cries. As you get to know your babies and their unique preferences, you can fit your responses to meet each child's needs.Getting to know each child as an individual can be especially challenging at first because you may feel there isn't enough of you to go around. You may feel torn between the babies, not knowing who needs you more.Trust yourself to give each infant what she needson any given day  or even hour by hour.If there's a day when you feel especially drawn to one of your babies, spend more time with her.Encourage your partner to focus on the other.Enlist the help of family membersto spend time with your babies.Let yourself appreciate and rely on the attention from your babies' nurses.They are there to help you take care of your little ones.Have confidence that your babies will do just fine, even if your attention is split sometimes.You can be flexible, and so can they. By doing your best, you are giving them enough to thrive.Feeding more than one babyWhen you have more than one baby, feeding decisions regarding the breast or bottle, breast milk or formula, can seem especially complicated. You may be able to breastfeed them all, or one baby may take a bottle more willingly. One baby may do better on breast milk and another on formula. Or you may try to pump milk for all your babies, and substitute formula when needed.If breastfeeding them all is your ultimate goal, flexibility is key. Whatever the situation, take your time to figure out what works best for you and your babies. And expect to adjust your plans as your babies grow.See BabyCenter's information onbreastfeeding twins or multiples, caring for newborn twins or multiples, andmore.ResourcesMarch of Dimes: Share Your StoryThis is an online community that serves NICU families.

Breastfeeding and the flu,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-and-the-flu_10324641.bc,"This article is adapted from information published by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and recommendations from the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and Johns Hopkins Children's Center.Should I stop breastfeeding if I think I've been exposed to the flu?As long as you're not ill, keep breastfeeding. Your milk provides disease-fighting antibodies that help build your baby's immune system. But if you start to develop flu symptoms, take extra precautions to protect your baby. The safest option is to pump your milk and have someone else bottle-feed it to your baby.Are there other ways I can protect my baby if I get the flu?While you're sick with the flu, you'll want to limit contact with your baby. In addition to having someone else bottle-feed your baby pumped breast milk or formula, if possible, try to limit your baby's exposure to your germs in other ways. For example:Wash your hands with soap and warm water before touching or holding your baby. If soap and water aren't available, use an alcohol-based hand cleaner.Frequently clean household surfaces, such as the kitchen counter, sinks, light switches, and doorknobs.Wear a face mask.If you can't wear a face mask, sneeze or cough into your elbow or a tissue. (Watch this kid-friendly Elmo video by the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services for a lesson on the best way to sneeze.) If you sneeze into a tissue, throw it away and then wash your hands.Put a clean, dry cloth blanket between you and your baby every time you hold or feed her.Wash your breasts thoroughly with mild soap and warm water before feedings.Don't share eating utensils, drinking glasses, washcloths, towels, beds, pillows, or blankets until you've been symptom-free for at least five days.Check with your healthcare provider to see if antiviral drugs are an option for you. They can ease your symptoms and shorten the length of your illness, which means less chance of exposure for your baby.Can I take medicine for the flu if I'm breastfeeding?Yes, it's okay to take antiviral drugs prescribed by your doctor, such as oseltamivir (Tamiflu) or zanamivir (Relenza), while breastfeeding. If you've been exposed to the flu and are taking prescribed antivirals as a preventive measure, you can safely continue breastfeeding as long as you don't have any symptoms.If you're tempted to take over-the-counter medicine to treat flu symptoms, check our Drugs and Milk Interactions Chart and ask your doctor what's safe.Can I breastfeed my baby if she has the flu?Definitely. Breastfeeding is one of the best things you can do to help your baby during an illness. Babies need more fluids when they're sick, and breast milk is best for them because it also helps build their immune system.What if I'm having trouble feeding my baby while she's sick?If your baby's too sick to breastfeed, try offering breast milk from a bottle, syringe, or eyedropper. If your baby also drinks formula, read our article on flu and formula feeding.How can I protect myself and my baby from the flu?Getting vaccinated is the best way to protect yourself and your baby from the flu. The CDC and AAP recommend that nearly everyone  including pregnant women and breastfeeding mothers  get an annual flu shot as soon as they become available each fall.Your baby can't be vaccinated until she's at least 6 months old. But if you and the other adults who are often in close contact with your baby get a flu shot, she'll have a better chance of staying healthy.Note: The CDC and AAP do not recommend the nasal spray flu vaccine (FluMist) for the 2016-2017 season because it isn't effective.For the most up-to-date information on the current flu season, check the CDC's flu site or call the CDC at (800) CDC-INFO or (800) 232-4636.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2016.

Your child's feeding timeline,https://www.babycenter.com/0_your-childs-feeding-timeline_10356968.bc,"When do children graduate from a liquid diet to eating solid food? When can they feed themselves? And when, oh when, will they stop making such a mess?Here's an approximate idea of when to expect your child to be able to handle everything from eating solids and finger foods to using a spoon and cup.BabyBirth to 4 monthsEats only breast milk, formula, or a combination of the two. Has a natural ability to root, suck, swallow, and gag. (Not to mention burp!)Red flag: If you notice your baby has signs of trouble with feeding (not gaining weight as expected, for example), or if she frequently arches her back, seems irritable, and coughs or chokes during feedings, contact your baby's doctor.4 to 6 monthsCan start trying solid food once he shows these signs of readiness:Has doubled his birth weight and weighs at least 13 poundsShows interest in your food and may even try to reach for itCan sit upright in a highchair with good head and neck controlOpens his mouth when you offer a spoonful of foodUses his tongue to move food to the back of his mouth and swallow it (instead of pushing it out of his mouth)Tip: Although breast milk or formula provides your baby with adequate nutrition, starting certain solid foods before he's 6 months old could reduce his risk of food allergies.6 to 8 monthsShe still needs breast milk or formula until her first birthday, but now eats small amounts of solid food as well and gradually wants more. Can start practicing drinking skills and hand-to-mouth coordination  without spills  by using a sippy cup.Baby-led weaning: Getting started Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:44Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:44Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Find out the basics of BLW and learn some safety tips before getting started. See all videos8 to 10 monthsTime for finger food! Can use his thumb and index finger to pick up small pieces of food. Gets better at eating food offered on a spoon.Drinking and chewing abilities improve. Begins rotary chewing (moving jaw diagonally to move food to the side or center of his mouth). Spontaneously starts consuming less liquid and more solid food.If your child can sit up on his own for an extended period of time, he may be able to join you at the table in a secure booster seat. (Though many parents prefer to keep their child in a highchair for now.)10 to 12 monthsHolds cup and spoon and starts self-feeding. Uses her lips to get food off spoon. Handles finger foods easily. Eats a wide variety of foods, including those with different textures.Points at or reaches for food when hungry.Toddler12 to 18 monthsCan use a spoon by himself (though not always very well). Can swallow from a cup. Closes mouth, shakes head, or uses other signs to let you know he's full.18 to 24 monthsMakes less of a mess when eating, but may play with or throw food when finished. Uses a spoon and fork increasingly well. She learns it's not always necessary to open her mouth wide to bite into food.Lets you know whether she's still hungry by using words like ""more"" and ""all done,"" and plays with plate or pushes it away when she's had enough.Preschooler24 to 36 monthsFeeds himself and continues to refine other mealtime skills. Ready to eat most things and enjoys choosing from what's offered. He's still too young for foods that can pose a choking risk.Feeding timeline: Your child's development Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:14Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:14Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

My breastfeeding story: Didn't put too much pressure on myself,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-didnt-put-too-much-pressure-on-myself_10419218.bc,"Name: KatieLives in: Sommerville, MassachusettsBreastfeeding experience: Did what she could, supplemented with formula, happy with how things wentMain challenges: Inverted nipples, lack of support from family, uneven milk supplyBreastfed for: 11 monthsMy storyI went to a breastfeeding class before giving birth so I could understand the process. It didn't seem all that hard but I wasn't 100 percent sold on its benefits. I basically went into it thinking: This is the cheapest thing to do, and it's a good thing to do. And if it doesn't work, it doesn't work.I found that breastfeeding was both easy and hard. Watching my newborn son, Jesse, move down to my breast to nurse was amazing. But I worried because I have inverted nipples. I'd already asked some lactation consultants about it and they told me I might need to do some extra work to breastfeed successfully.In the hospital, the first lactation consultant I saw gave me a nipple shield, which helped. I still remember the pain I felt in my shoulders because I was tense and stressed out about how to hold Jesse and get him to latch on. I felt like I needed to do it exactly right.I was producing more from the right breast than the left  three times as much. Given this and my inverted nipples, I continued to have questions for lactation consultants. I saw one at my son's pediatrician's office and another at my OB's office. It was helpful because each had different advice that I could try.My family was supportive of breastfeeding, until it got hard. Within the first week my mother said, ""Maybe you should try some formula."" And then by three weeks, my sister and my father started saying, ""Maybe there's something wrong with your milk.""I eventually did use formula  about two bottles a day. It gave me a bit of a break.I went back to work when Jesse was 3.5 months, and I pumped three times a day. I have an office to pump in, so I'm lucky that way.By then we started traveling a lot, too. My mother was seriously ill and we flew down to Kentucky every month. We'd stay with family and schedules were up in the air. I had been strict about Jesse's feeding schedule but couldn't keep it up. He didn't want to nurse as much when we were in Kentucky. I think he was just too distracted. So he began nursing for shorter periods of time and eventually he was nursing fewer times every day.One day when he was 11 months old we were lying in bed and I tried to feed him. He went to latch on and then reared back with a disgusted look on his face. I had this moment of feeling hurt and rejected but it was also funny, so I was like, ""Okay, I get it. We're done."" I bottle-fed for a few weeks after that but we were already well on our way to transitioning to a sippy cup.My biggest lesson learnedBreastfeeding had its challenges and I don't know how I got to the part where it was easy. Getting advice from lactation consultants helped. Just go with it and don't expect too much or have too many rules for yourself.Back to all breastfeeding essays"
Colic: What is it?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_colic-what-is-it_77.bc,"My baby cries all the time. Could it be colic?Colic is uncontrollable crying in an otherwise healthy baby. Your baby is considered colicky if hes younger than 5 months old and cries for more than three hours in a row on three or more days a week for at least three weeks (phew!). Colic isn't a disease and won't cause your baby any long-term harm, but it's a tough thing to go through for babies and their parents.If your baby is colicky, find more than 20 sanity-saving tips to help you deal with it in our article about coping with colic.What are the symptoms of colic?Colic most often shows up when a baby is 2 or 3 weeks old (or two or three weeks after his due date if he's a preemie).Babies normally cry when they're wet, hungry, frightened, or tired, but a baby with colic cries excessively, often at the same time of day (usually in the late afternoon or evening). If your baby is colicky, you may notice that his cries at this time are louder and higher pitched than his normal crying and that the episodes start and end suddenly.Your colicky baby may also show signs of a gassy tummy. Gas doesn't cause colic, but he might be extra gassy because a baby with colic often swallows air when he cries. You may notice that your colicky baby clenches his fingers, arches his back, becomes flushed, and alternately extends or pulls up his legs and passes gas as he cries. He may sometimes feel better after passing gas or having a bowel movement.How long does colic last?Thankfully, there's a light at the end of the tunnel. Colic tends to peak around 6 weeks, and then improves significantly between 3 and 4 months. By 4 months of age, 80 to 90 percent of infants are over colic. The remaining small percentage might take another month.Yes, that's a long tunnel. In the meantime, learn how to comfort your baby as best you can and ask for help when you need it. Caring for a colicky baby can be very stressful, and you need to take regular breaks to maintain your own well-being. Have your partner or a friend or relative take over while you go for a walk or let loose with a good cry yourself when you need to.Why are some babies colicky?Colic is one of the great mysteries of baby life. Experts estimate that between 8 and 40 percent of babies become colicky. The condition is equally common among firstborn and later-born babies, among boys and girls, and among breastfed and formula-fed infants. No one knows why some babies are more prone to it than others, but theories abound. And there may well be more than one cause.We do know that babies born to mothers who smoked during pregnancy or postpartum are at increased risk of colic (though this risk is reduced if the baby is breastfed).Some experts believe that long bouts of colicky crying are a physical release for sensitive babies. By the time evening rolls around, they say, these babies just can't handle any more sights, sounds, or sensations, and so they become distraught and cry.Another theory is that colic is sometimes caused by an imbalance of healthy bacteria in the intestines. Studies have shown that infants with colic have different intestinal microflora than infants who don't suffer from colic. Treatment with probiotics (specifically Lactobacillus reuteri) has been shown to help with colic symptoms in some babies. Ask your doctor for a specific probiotic recommendation.Should I take my baby to the doctor if I think he has colic?Yes, it's a good idea to talk with a doctor about your baby's crying. She can rule out other potential causes, like intestinal problems or urinary infections, and she'll want to check that your baby is feeding and growing normally. She'll also help you determine the best course of action for your baby if he does have colic.And if your baby has other symptoms  like fever, vomiting, or bloody stools  call his doctor immediately. These symptoms are not due to colic.Can a food allergy cause colic?One of the things the doctor might consider is whether your baby might have an intolerance for or an allergy to cow's milk protein. Although it doesn't cause colic, it is one of the culprits of tummy trouble that mimics colic. If this is the case for your formula-fed baby, his doctor may recommend switching to a hydrolysated formula (one in which the protein has been broken down). If cow's milk protein is a problem for your baby, his symptoms will probably improve a week or so after the change in formula.If your baby is breastfed, following a nondairy diet may be worth a try, even though there's no conclusive evidence that it helps. If you're breastfeeding, talk to your doctor about cutting back on milk, cheese, and yogurt for a couple of weeks to see whether it makes a difference. (Cow's milk protein can remain in breast milk that long, so this dietary experiment takes some patience.)If you're breastfeeding, it's also possible that your baby is sensitive to something in your diet other than dairy products. There's plenty of controversy about which foods are problematic (and the data is conflicting), but the prime suspects seem to be wheat, eggs, nuts, fruit, caffeine, and chocolate.To see whether one of these foods is making your baby uncomfortable, avoid them all for a few days. If your baby seems better, reintroduce one food at a time, allowing a few days between reintroductions. If your baby starts fussing again after you start eating a certain food, you may have discovered the offending substance. Talk with your doctor if you notice a certain food makes your baby fussy.Can gripe water help with colic?Many parents recommend gripe water or antigas (simethicone/mylicon) drops, which are sold over-the-counter, to soothe your babys discomfort  though neither has been proven effective.See our article on coping with colic for suggestions for calming your baby and managing your own stress.5 tips for soothing a colicky baby Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:43Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:43Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

How to care for your baby's gums and emerging teeth,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-care-for-your-babys-gums-and-emerging-teeth_126.bc,"Do I need to clean my baby's gums before his teeth come in?Yes. Even before your baby sports his first tooth, it's a good idea to get into the habit of wiping his gums with gauze or a soft wet washcloth during bath time. You don't need to use any toothpaste yet. Simply wrap the cloth or gauze around your index finger and rub it gently over his gums.Bacteria in the mouth usually can't harm the gums before the teeth emerge, but it can be hard to tell when the teeth are starting to push through, so you'll want to start early. Getting your baby used to having his mouth cleaned as part of his daily routine should make it easier to transition into toothbrushing later on, too.What's the best way to brush my baby's teeth after they start coming in?As your child's teeth start to appear (generally around 6 months), you'll need to start brushing them. (If your child is healthy and still hasn't gotten her first tooth by the end of her first year, don't worry  some children don't start getting teeth until 15 to 18 months.)Brush twice a day. Brush in the morning and right before bedtime. Use a baby toothbrush with a small head and grip suitable for your hand.Use a tiny amount of fluoride toothpaste. To avoid giving your child too much fluoride, use a thin smear of toothpaste or a dot the size of a grain of rice. (It's fine to use any fluoridated toothpaste. Note that many toothpastes marketed for babies don't contain fluoride.)Brush gently on the inside and outside of each of your baby's teeth, as well as her tongue (if she'll let you), to dislodge bacteria that can cause bad breath. Since you're using such a small amount of toothpaste, there's no need to rinse.Replace the toothbrush as soon as the bristles start to look worn or splayed.For now, your baby's teeth are probably far enough apart that you don't have to worry about flossing. In fact, there's no evidence that flossing baby teeth makes a difference. Most dentists recommend starting to floss when tooth surfaces touch and you can't clean them with a toothbrush.How can I tell if my baby is getting the right amount of fluoride?Your baby's developing teeth can benefit from a little fluoride. (The amount recommended for children under 3 is .25 milligrams per day.) This mineral helps prevent tooth decay by strengthening tooth enamel and making it more resistant to acids and harmful bacteria.Your baby can get fluoride from toothpaste, water, supplements (if necessary), and a fluoride varnish that his primary healthcare provider or dentist can apply to his teeth.Note: In general, it's not a good idea to give your baby water until he's about 6 months old. Until then, he'll get all the hydration he needs from breast milk or formula, even in hot weather. Read more about giving water to your baby.If the water you use to make your baby's formula contains fluoride, he'll get fluoride from his bottle feedings. Most municipal water supplies are fortified with adequate fluoride. (Call your local water authority to find out about yours). Read more about what kind of water to use to prepare baby formula.If your municipal water supply isn't fluoridated or you get your water from a well, you might consider buying a test kit from your local health department, a hardware store, or a pharmacy.If the fluoride content is less than .3 parts per million, ask your child's doctor or dentist whether you should give your child a fluoride supplement. The doctor can prescribe fluoride in the form of drops that you can add to your baby's bottle or cereal once a day. Experts don't recommend fluoride supplements for babies under 6 months old.Bottled water and fruit juices may contain fluoride, although the amount isn't always listed on the label.Keep in mind that while a little fluoride is a good thing for your baby's teeth, too much of it can lead to a condition called fluorosis, which causes white spots to show up on your child's adult teeth. This is why it's important to use only the tiniest amount of toothpaste until your child is old enough to rinse and spit it out.When should I start taking my baby to the dentist?The American Academy of Pediatrics and the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry recommend that you take your child to the dentist within six months after her first tooth erupts, or by her first birthday, whichever comes first.In the meantime, at everywell-baby visit, your baby's primary healthcare provider should take a look at your baby's teeth (if she has any) and apply fluoride varnish every three to six months, depending on your baby's risk of cavities. Risk factors include a family history of cavities and poor dental health in the mother during pregnancy.When you do take your child to the dentist, be sure to communicate what fluoride treatments your baby has already received at the doctor's office.If you can't afford dental care for your baby, consider getting in touch with your local health department to ask about resources.Do certain foods cause tooth decay in babies?Certain foods can contribute to cavities. Sweet foods like these are a common culprit:fruitdried fruitjuicepeanut butter and jellyStarches can also contribute to cavities:breadscrackerspastapretzelsServe these foods at mealtime rather than as snacks so they're more likely to get dislodged and won't sit on the teeth too long. Serving them with water is also helpful.Don't put your baby to bed with a bottle of milk, formula, juice, or sweetened liquid. These liquids feed bacteria in the mouth that cause tooth decay.Learn more:Video: How to care for your baby's teeth and gumsQuiz: Test your tooth care smartsSlideshow: Your baby's teeth, in order of appearanceAll about teething and tooth careShow sources Hide sources AAPD.

Breastfeeding as a working mom,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-as-a-working-mom_641.bc,"Can I continue to breastfeed once I return to work?Yes, you can. If you live near work or have on-site or nearby daycare, you may be able to take nursing breaks to feed your baby. If that's not possible, you have two choices:Option 1: You can keep up your milk supply by using a high-quality electric breast pump to express milk during the workday. Your child's caregiver can give your baby bottles of your expressed breast milk. (You can also supplement with formula if you can't produce enough milk.) You'll still be able to nurse your child whenever you're not at work.The U.S. Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA), signed into law in 2010, requires employers to provide moms of babies younger than 12 months a reasonable break time for pumping and a private place to pump, other than a bathroom. (Employers with fewer than 50 employees don't have to comply if compliance would create ""undue hardship."") For more details, read this U.S. government fact sheet.Option 2: If you can't or don't want to pump at work, you can gradually replace daytime feedings with formula while you're still at home but continue to nurse at night and in the morning. Remember, though, that if you don't nurse or pump during the day, your milk supply will diminish.Breastfeeding Problem SolverFind solutions to a variety of breastfeeding challenges, including nipple pain, low milk supply, and more.What are the advantages of pumping at work?Pumping at work stimulates your milk production, so you'll have plenty of milk available when you nurse. Your baby will have the health and nutritional advantages of breast milk even when you're not there. What's more, pumping can be a wonderful way to feel connected to your baby during the workday.You'll save money by not buying formula (or not as much of it). And you may avoid missed workdays, because breastfed babies are half as likely to get sick in their first year as those on formula.One of the best things about continuing to breastfeed is coming home to a baby who wants to nurse. You get to snuggle right away, re-establish your bond, and nurture your baby in a way no one else can.To make sure your baby will want to nurse when you get home, ask your caregiver not to feed him during the last hour of the workday, or to feed him just enough to take the edge off any hunger. Then you and your baby can look forward to a warm reunion every day.Show sources Hide sources DOL. Undated. Fact sheet 73: Break time for nursing mothers under the FSLA.

Your 1-year-old: Week 2,https://www.babycenter.com/6_your-1-year-old-week-2_10329286.bc,
Traveling with an 8- to 17-month-old,https://www.babycenter.com/0_traveling-with-an-8-to-17-month-old_7268.bc,"By the time your baby is 8 months old, she's become used to her surroundings and familiar faces. Travel can disrupt her sense of security and routine, especially when visiting an unfamiliar place or meeting lots of strangers.""If your baby has to eat, sleep, and play in a way she's not used to, she can get really cranky and difficult, and who can blame her?"" says Susanne Denham, a child development psychologist and professor of psychology at George Mason University.When you think your little one is ready for a change of scene, build up to it slowly and schedule plenty of downtime away from strangers to let her decompress. At this age, she realizes she's in a new place, but she hasn't grasped the concept of travel yet.To make your trip safe and successful, consider these tips:Health and safetyBefore you travel, find out whether your accommodations can be childproofed before you arrive. If not, bring your own childproofing kit that includes doorknob covers, plastic outlet covers, and pipe cleaners or twist ties to secure drapery and electrical cords. If you need to travel light, masking tape or duct tape provides a quick fix for most danger zones.Assemble a first-aid kit with the supplies you'll need to deal with minor medical problems while on the road. Don't forget prescription medications, even if your child needs them only on occasion. (It's always when you leave the inhaler at home that your little one has an asthma attack at Grandma's.)Fill out an emergency sheet with your child's health information. Include the contact names and numbers of healthcare providers and a list of the medications your child takes. That way, everything is handy if you need it.Take a hat to shade him from the sun in warm weather or keep him warm in cool weather.Sunscreen is a must if you'll be spending time outdoors  no matter what season. Use one with both UVA and UVB protection that's at least SPF 15 or up to SPF 50.In the car, your baby should always ride rear-facing in the back seat  in either a rear-facing car seat, infant car seat or a convertible infant-toddler car seat (which can face either the rear or the front). Before you leave, make sure the car seat is properly installed and that the car seat's belts are correctly threaded. Adjust the harness so it fits your baby snugly and securely.Get removable shade screens for the car's side windows  available at baby supply and discount stores  to shield your child's eyes from the sun and keep him from getting too hot. Peel-and-stick shades are more secure, and therefore safer, than those that attach with suction cups.Keep your baby or toddler as safe as possible when you take public transit (like a bus, train, or taxi) by bringing along a car seat. The car seat provides some protection even when there are no seat belts to strap it in. If you're traveling with your child and he's in a stroller, put on the stroller's brakes when you're riding public transportation.If you've purchased an airplane seat for your baby or toddler, bring an FAA-approved car seat for him to sit in. (This is the safest way for young children to fly.) If you haven't bought a ticket for your child, you still might be able to use the car seat if there are empty seats on board. For more about flying with a young child, see our list of questions to ask your airline ahead of time.)If your baby's or toddler's ears seem to hurt from air pressure changes during takeoff and landing, encourage him to breastfeed or suck on a bottle, pacifier, or sippy cup. If he's strapped into a car seat, give him something to suck on in the seat, rather than take him out to breastfeed. It's safest for both of you to be securely buckled in.Keep in mind that not all young children experience ear pain  there are no firm medical guidelines on the topic, so just use your judgment. If your child is sleeping soundly, leave him be and he might get through the takeoff or landing without any trouble. (He'll wake up and show his discomfort if he's bothered.)If you're crossing time zones and are worried about upsetting your little one's schedule, take steps to fight jet lag. Try shifting his sleep hours for the few days leading up to your departure and exposing him to sunlight once you reach your destination.You may also want to keep the same schedule in the new time zone if that works best for you. Whatever you choose to do, plan it out ahead of time and try not to overschedule the first few days of your trip  you can't predict how disrupted your child's rhythms might be.If you're traveling by plane for the first time with your child, it's a good idea to check out the travel tips from the Transportation Security Administration.Food and comfortIf you're breastfeeding, pack an extra water bottle or thermos to help you stay well hydrated. If you're flying, buy something to drink or fill an empty bottle at a water fountain after you clear security.If you're not breastfeeding, it's most convenient to bring ready-to-use formula for your baby. Or just make a few bottles of formula at home to bring along. If you're traveling by plane, review the policies for bringing liquids on board and hand the formula to security officers when you go through screening.Bring only as much baby food as you'll need for the journey. You can always buy more once you reach your destination.But if you're traveling internationally or to a place where it might be tough to find what you need, it may be less of a headache to pack a full supply of food. Also, you never know when a plane might be delayed, so it's always wise to pack an extra day's supply of formula if you're formula feeding.Also helpful during meals: Bring a bib that's large enough to cover most of your child's outfit, has a plastic or waterproof coating (so it can be easily wiped off), and can be folded or rolled for easy packing.Bring enough diapers for the trip (or enough to last until you reach your destination and can buy more), bags for dirty diapers, and diaper rash ointment. Diaper covers provide added insurance against leaks.Pack at least one extra change of clothes for yourself and your child. Store them someplace that's easily accessible, like in your carry-on bag. You never know when a diaper leak, spit-up, or other mess might render an outfit unwearable.EntertainmentTake along a goody bag containing a few of your child's favorite toys, plus some surprises. Possibilities include musical toys, board books, empty containers, nesting toys, and hand puppets. Playthings that hold your child's attention the longest are your best bets.Travel gearStick a travel-friendly changing pad in your diaper bag to use in public or airplane bathrooms.Stash some large, resealable plastic bags in your car trunk or diaper bag. They're a simple solution for temporarily storing messy items like dirty diapers, bibs, and wet bathing suits.If you need both a car seat and stroller for your trip, and your child is still small enough for an infant car seat (check the height and weight limits on the seat), a stroller or stroller frame that can carry the car seat cuts down on the gear you have to lug. It also saves you the hassle of getting in and out of cars and airplanes when you can move your sleeping babe from the car to the restaurant without disturbing his slumber.A lightweight stroller (sometimes called an umbrella stroller) isn't as cushy as a larger stroller, but is easy to travel with because it's lightweight and compact. You can even stow it in a plane's overhead bin, if permitted by your airline. You may be able to check your stroller at the gate and have it ready and waiting for you at your destination, but be sure to check your airline's policy before your trip.A baby backpack is a great way to keep your hands free while carrying your child  and it gives her a fascinating view from on high. (But make sure you can handle shouldering her weight for an extended period of time.)If you'll be staying in a hotel or motel, request a crib when you make your room reservation or you may be out of luck when you arrive. Inspect it carefully to make sure it's safe and in good condition before using it.Another option: Rent equipment or bring along your own portacrib, play yard, or portable bed. A portable play yard makes an instant, child-safe area that you can plunk down in relatives' homes, hotels, or other places that may not be childproofed.See our detailed packing checklists for traveling with a baby or toddler.Have a young baby?

(If it's hard and dry, your baby may be constipatedand need some help getting her pooping process back on track.)Breastfed newborns often poop after every feeding (roughly six to 10 times a day), but after three to six weeks or so, they can slow down and start having less frequent bowel movements.Other than that common slowdown, there's no need to worry if your baby's pooping pattern stays fairly consistent and she's acting like her usual self. But if there's a sudden change or you notice signs that she's uncomfortable or unhappy, give your doctor a ring.Newborn poop: MeconiumExpect to find a greenish-black, tarry, sticky poop that looks like motor oil in your newborn's diaper. Since meconium is made of amniotic fluid, mucus, skin cells, and other stuff ingested in utero, it doesn't really smell  so you may not realize it's time for a diaper change.Newborn poop: Transitional stoolWhen your baby is 2 to 4 days old, his poop will become lighter in color  sort of an army green  and less sticky. This transitional stool is a sign that he's started digesting early breast milk or formula and that his intestinal tract is A-okay.Healthy breastfed poopIf your baby is exclusively breastfed, her poop will be yellow or slightly green and have a mushy or creamy consistency. It may be runny enough to resemble diarrhea. Breastfed poop typically looks like Dijon mustard and cottage cheese mixed together and may be dotted with little seed-like flecks. Interestingly, its smell isn't half bad.There are many shades of normal when it comes to breastfed poop. One you might see is a greener hue, which could signify that you ate something different than you normally do. If your baby isn't experiencing any other symptoms, there's no need to worry.Low-calorie breastfed poopIf you see bright green and frothy poop in your baby's diaper, almost like algae, she's probably getting too much foremilk  the low-calorie milk that comes first in a feeding  and not enough hindmilk, the good higher-fat stuff. It could mean that you're not feeding her long enough on each breast. To remedy this, start each feeding on the breast you ended on last time.Healthy formula-fed poopFormula-fed babies have pasty, peanut butter-like poop on the brown color spectrum: tan-brown, yellow-brown, or green-brown. It's more pungent than poop from breastfed babies and a little less pungent than poop from babies who are eating solid food, but you'll recognize the smell.Iron-fortified poopIf you give your baby an iron supplement, his poop may turn dark green or almost black. This doesn't happen often, but it's a completely normal variation that would make Popeye proud.One thing: If your baby's poop looks blackish and he's not taking an iron supplement, it's a good idea to call the doctor to make sure it's not melena, or digested blood.Solid-food poopOnce you start changing your baby's input to solid foods  infant cereal, pureed bananas, and so on  you'll almost instantly notice a change in her output, especially if she's breastfed.Solid-food poop tends to be brown or dark brown and thicker than peanut butter, but still mushy. It's also smellier.Poop with partially digested foodOccasionally your baby's poop will have identifiable chunks of food in it or be tinged with a surprising hue of the rainbow, like red, orange, or dark blue. Red could mean beets, orange suggests carrots, and dark blue implies blueberries (you may see pieces of blueberry skin in there, too).Not to worry! You're probably seeing this because certain foods are only partially digestible or travel so quickly through the intestines that they don't have time to completely break down. It also happens when your baby eats a lot of one type of food or doesn't chew a mouthful completely before he swallows.The time to call the doctor is if your baby's poop consistently has undigested food in it. The doctor will check to make sure your baby's intestines are absorbing food and nutrients properly.DiarrheaIn babies, diarrhea is very runny and appears to be made up of water more than solids. It can be yellow, green, or brown and can seep or ""explode"" out of the diaper.Diarrhea can be a sign of an infection or allergy, and if it lasts for a while without being treated, can lead to dehydration. Call the doctor if your baby is 3 months old or younger, has more than two or three diarrhea-filled diapers, or continues having diarrhea for more than a day or two.It's also wise to call the doctor if your baby's diarrhea contains visible blood or mucus.ConstipationIf your baby's poop is hard and looks like little pebbles, she's probably constipated. Your baby may be visibly uncomfortable when she's pooping, and the poop may even be tinged with blood from irritating the anus on the way out.One or two pebbly diapers isn't a concern, but if your baby has three or more (or if you see blood), it's best to call the doctor. Constipation often happens in babies who are being introduced to solid foods, or it can be a sign of milk or soy protein sensitivity or a lack of tolerance to something in breast milk or formula. Your doctor may recommend giving your baby water, pear juice, or prune juice to help move things along.Poop with mucusDoes your baby's diaper look like it's been slimed? Greenish poop streaked with shiny, glistening strings means there's mucus in it. This sometimes happens when a baby is especially drooly, since mucus in saliva often goes undigested.But mucus in poop is also a telltale sign of an infection or allergy. If it's accompanied by any other symptoms or shows up in your baby's diaper for two days or more, call the doctor to rule out any problems.Bloody poop: Bright red bloodBright red blood can show up in baby poop for a few different reasons. Call your doctor if you notice:Normal poop tinged with red blood, which is often a sign of a milk protein allergyConstipated poop with a hint of red blood, likely a result of tears in the anus or tiny hemorrhoids.Diarrhea mixed with red blood, which can indicate a bacterial infection.Bloody poop: Blackish bloodSometimes the blood in a baby's poop looks black, which means it's been digested. When this digested blood appears in a baby's diaper  usually in little flecks that look like black poppy or sesame seeds  it's often because the baby is breastfed and swallowing blood from Mom's cracked and bleeding nipples.While this is a sign that you need some pain relief, it doesn't pose a threat to your baby. Still, you should call the doctor to make sure it's not something more serious, like bleeding from your baby's upper intestinal tract.Alarming poopAs a general rule, if you see anything completely out of the ordinary in your baby's diaper, call the doctor. There are several surprising (but, thankfully, rare!) variations on poop that suggest a serious problem:Thick black poop made up mostly of digested blood (called melena). It's dark and tarry like meconium but a bit firmer and less sticky.Poop consisting almost entirely of red blood, known as ""currant jelly poop,"" which indicates a severe intestinal problem.Pale, chalky, clay-colored poop (acholic poop) that signals liver or gallbladder failure. It looks and feels similar to tan or whitish clay or Play-Doh.These kinds of poop rarely show up, but if they do, get medical attention right away.Back to our poop pageShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a.

Sippy cup do's and don'ts,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sippy-cup-dos-and-donts_1439508.bc,"What is a sippy cup?A sippy cup is a training cup  usually plastic  with a screw- or snap-on lid and a spout that lets your child drink without spilling. You can get models with or without handles and choose ones with different types of spouts.Sippy cups can be a great way for your baby to transition from nursing or bottle-feeding to a regular cup. They can also improve hand-to-mouth coordination. When your baby has the motor skills to handle a cup but not the skills to keep the drink from spilling, a sippy cup can give him some independence while keeping cleanup to a minimum.When should I introduce a sippy cup?Encourage your child to use a training cup whenever you think she's ready. Some babies enjoy using a sippy cup as early as 6 months, and others aren't interested until after their first birthday.To prevent tooth decay, the American Dental Association recommends transitioning from a bottle to a training cup by your child's first birthday.Feeding timeline: Your child's development Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:14Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:14Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all baby videosWhat's the best way to transition to a sippy cup?Some babies take to a sippy cup immediately, and some take a while to get used to the idea. (Some may never use one.) Here are some tips for introducing the sippy cup:Start off with one that has a soft, pliable spout because this feels more familiar to your baby than a hard plastic spout.Show your baby how to raise the cup to his mouth and tip it up to drink. Show him that the spout is like a nipple by touching the tip of the spout to the roof of his mouth to stimulate the sucking reflex.Give it some time. Until your baby masters the technique, you may want to put only water in the cup to avoid too many messes. And don't worry if your baby doesn't take to the sippy cup right away. Just wait a few weeks and try again.Shop around. There are all kinds of sippy cups, with all kinds of spouts. Sippy cups aren't too expensive, so it's worth letting your baby test-drive several if one isn't working. Try different models until you find one that suits your baby.What should I do if my child refuses the sippy cup?Babies have all kinds of reasons for rejecting sippy cups. And of course, there's no law saying she ever has to use one. Some babies go straight to a regular cup from the breast or bottle. But if you want your baby to use a sippy cup, try these tactics that other parents have used successfully:Dip the spout into breast milk or formula before giving it to your baby. Another approach is to put a bottle nipple (without the bottle) in her mouth and after she starts sucking, replace it with the sippy spout. Some parents have even had success simply substituting the sippy cup for the bottle.Switch halfway through a feeding. If she drinks from a bottle, give her half of her formula or breast milk in the bottle. When it's empty, switch to the sippy cup for the second half of the feeding. (Continue to hold her as you do when she's bottle-feeding.)Modify the sippy spout. Some cups have valves that are so effective at keeping the liquid from spilling that it's a lot of work to drink from it. If your baby sucks on the sippy spout but doesn't get anything, try taking out the valve that controls the flow (if the sippy cup has one of these and it's removable).Work in reverse order. Teach your baby to drink from the sippy without the lid on it first. Put just a teaspoon or two of liquid in at a time and help her raise the cup to her mouth. After she gets the hang of that and understands that there's liquid inside the cup, put the lid on (without the valve, if there is one). Finally, put the valve in and let her take over.Offer your baby a straw. Some cups come with a built-in straw, and some babies find these easier to use than a spout. If your baby does get the hang of sucking from a straw, she may then be better able to handle sucking from the spout.Try other beverages. Some babies will drink water or juice  but not breast milk or formula  from a sippy cup. (But don't give juice to a baby 6 months or younger, and limit juice for older babies and toddlers to no more than 4 ounces a day.)Show your baby how it's done. Get a clean sippy and let your baby see you drink from it. Or have a sibling drink from a sippy in front of the baby. Sometimes making a little sucking noise is all it takes to inspire a baby to start sucking. Just be sure to give your baby a clean sippy cup. Sharing a cup with your baby can increase the amount of tooth-decaying bacteria in her saliva. What not to doUsing a sippy cup may seem like a piece of cake, but there are some pitfalls you'll want to avoid:Never let your child take a sippy cup of juice or milk to bed. The sugars can pool in his mouth and cause tooth decay. The same goes for walking around with one in hand for hours on end. One idea is to limit juice and milk to meals and snack time, and refill his sippy cup with water when he's thirsty.Clean the cup thoroughly (especially the lid and plastic stopper) between uses. Liquid can easily become trapped in the nooks and crannies of a sippy cup and valve, leading to the growth of bacteria and mold.If you can't wash a sippy cup right away, at least give it a good rinse. If that's not possible, drain any remaining liquid and take it apart. Periodically check your lids and valves for damage or mold.Don't expect the sippy cup to be the magic answer to weaning. For some babies, it simply replaces the bottle and presents another weaning challenge.Still, many parents find it more acceptable to see their growing child with a sippy than a bottle in hand. And if used properly, a sippy cup can be less damaging to your baby's teeth than a bottle.Don't use the sippy cup for too long. As soon as your child can handle it, switch to a regular cup. Most toddlers can manage a two-handled open cup by the time they're 2 years old.What and how much should I give my baby each day in her sippy cup?If your baby is younger than 6 months old, simply give her a portion of her breast milk or formula in the sippy cup each day.Generally, water and juice are unnecessary for breastfed and bottle-fed infants in the first six months of life. (And don't give your baby cow's milk until she's at least a year old.)After six months, if your baby's thirsty between feedings, refill her sippy with water.Babies 6 months and older can be given up to 4 ounces of 100 percent fruit juice a day in addition to formula or breast milk. (But don't give it at bedtime to prevent tooth decay.)Once your child starts drinking whole milk (at age 1), experts recommend giving her no more than 32 ounces of milk and a half cup of juice per day. Otherwise your toddler may be more likely to get cavities and be too full to eat at mealtime.Are there safety concerns I should be aware of?Plastics in baby bottles used to be made with the chemical bisphenol A (BPA), but this has been banned since 2012. (And many manufacturers had already stopped using BPA before that because of public concerns over exposing children to this chemical.)Just to be safe, don't let your child drink from a plastic cup or bottle that is scratched or damaged. A worn cup with scratches is more likely to harbor bacteria and may leach chemicals.But any plastic can leach chemicals. Two recent studies even found that some BPA-free cups leach even higher amounts of synthetic hormones than those made with BPA. If you're worried about plastic, consider using steel or glass cups.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015. Discontinuing the bottle.

Sample baby schedules for 9- and 10-month-olds,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sample-baby-schedules-for-9-and-10-month-olds_3657239.bc,"Getting into a routine with your baby is a personal thing. You'll learn to read your baby's cues to develop a pattern of eating, sleeping, and playing that meets your little one's needs and works for your family.That said, it can be a big help to see what other moms and dads are doing. We asked parents of 9- and 10-month-olds to share their baby's daily schedule, then picked the eight below as a helpful representation.As you're creating a schedule for your baby, keep in mind that at 9 and 10 months most babies need:Solid foods three times a day, plus about 24 to 32 ounces of breast milk or formula in a 24-hour period. (Get specific tips on how to tell whether your baby is getting enough breast milk or formula.) By now, your baby will likely be eating a variety of different foods and taking an active role at mealtimes by self-feeding and drinking from a sippy cup.About 14 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period  this includes nighttime sleep and naps. Two naps during the day (morning and afternoon) is typical.

Sometimes she'll get in her jumper for a change of pace, but she doesn't want to be in there much now that she's more mobile.2 p.m.: ""Afternoon Milk Snack"" for 15 to 20 minutes. More playtime.3 p.m.: Afternoon nap. We follow the exact same routine as with the morning nap.4:30 p.m.: She wakes up. I'm usually done with work by this time. Kamryn and I play with her toys in the living room or go outside. I think she gets bored with being in the office all the time  even though it's more like a den and has two other rooms that she can explore.5:15 p.m.: Kamryn nurses for 15 minutes.5:30 p.m.: I put her in her highchair and give her some finger foods while I prep for dinner.5:45 p.m.: Dinnertime for Kamryn. I feed her a stage 3 dinner. Daddy comes home and finishes making the meal I started for us.6 p.m.: My husband and I eat dinner. Kamryn either plays while we eat, or she'll want to eat what we're having so I'll give her little bits of our food.6:30 p.m.: Clean up the kitchen.6:45 p.m.: Family playtime. It's the only time we all get to be together to play during the week. Sometimes we go on a walk.8 p.m.: Bath time! Kamryn loves her baths. She has a lot of hair and likes to grab it while eating, so baths are a nightly necessity. She plays with her bath toys and splashes around in the tub for a good 15 to 20 minutes every night.8:20 p.m.: Dry her, apply lotion and butt paste, and put her in a fresh diaper, pj's, and her sleeper sack. I comb her hair and then Daddy holds her while I get ready for her last milk snack. I nurse her for 10 to 15 minutes and lay her down for the night. Sometimes she's awake, but most of the time she falls asleep while nursing.8:40 p.m.: My husband and I relax, watch TV, and talk about our day.9:30 p.m.: We go to bed. Schedule 6: A formula-feeding part-time working mom of a 10-month-old and an older childEditor's note: This schedule is a combination (parent-led and baby-led) routineJulian's schedule at daycare is very similar to the one below, except that we leave the house around 7:30 a.m. and his naps are shorter and usually start later. On daycare days, he's usually in bed earlier at night and has a mid-morning snack (typically finger foods like pieces of fruit or cereal Os).6 to 6:30 a.m. (sometimes 5:45ish): Wakes and gets a 6-ounce bottle of formula right away. Then I change his diaper and his clothes.7 a.m.: Breakfast  usually one jar of baby food or the homemade equivalent, some cereal Os, and small pieces of banana.7:30 to 8:30 a.m.: Playtime on the floor with big brother Ethan and Mommy.8:30 or 9 a.m.: Goes down for a nap in his crib, usually one and a half to two hours.10:30 or 11 a.m.: He wakes up and has a 6-ounce bottle. After this we have playtime at home or leave for a playdate.Noon: Lunch  a jar of baby food or homemade puree, finger foods, and water in a sippy cup.1 p.m.: Nap, usually for two hours.3 p.m.: A 6-ounce bottle. After this we have playtime at home or leave for a playdate.5 to 6 p.m.: Dinner  finger foods, a teething biscuit, and either jarred baby food or homemade.6 to 6:30 p.m.: He has a bath.6:30 to 7:15 p.m.: Julian has another 6-ounce bottle, then I brush his teeth, read him a book or two, and get him ready for bed. He sleeps through the night nearly all the time.Schedule 7: A breastfeeding stay-at-home mom of a 9-month-oldEditor's note: This schedule is a baby-led routineMatthew has a little bit of a schedule, at least during the daytime. Sundays are off-schedule because we have church and then spend the day at my parents' house. But on most weekdays it goes like this:Between 6 and 7 a.m.: He wakes up and snuggles in bed with Mommy and Daddy. I nurse him, and then we get up and get dressed. He has playtime  he usually starts off in his activity saucer and has a snack of cereal Os while he plays. Daddy plays with Matthew as much as possible before he leaves for work. Depending on what time my husband has to be to work and how much I need to get done that day (housework, etc.) I may sleep in until he leaves.Around 8 or so: Breakfast  stage 2 fruit (although he isn't eating much baby food anymore  he would rather feed himself  so most of the time he doesn't finish a whole jar), yogurt, small chunks of fruit, and more cereal Os. More playtime. He likes to play with all sorts of toys on the floor, walk around the house holding Mommy's fingers, jump in the doorway jumper, and have me read him books.Around 9:30 or 10 a.m.: Nurse and nap. He usually sleeps for about an hour, but it can be anywhere from 45 minutes to two hours. If we have time after he wakes up, we'll run errands or go to the library. Once a week, we have playgroup. When we're out, he has a sippy cup with water. I try to keep a sippy cup around his play area at home, too.Around noon: Lunch  a jar of stage 2 fruit or veggies (once again, he doesn't usually eat it all) and some peas, corn, or small pieces of carrots or other veggies to feed himself. I give him pieces of whatever I'm eating  maybe some cheese cubes, part of a sandwich, or macaroni and cheese. We're getting into more finger foods, since that's all he wants!Around 1:30 p.m.: Nurse and nap. This is usually his longer nap of the day  from one to two hours. If I'm really tired, I'll sleep with him, and if he wakes before I'm ready to get up (say, after one hour instead of two), then I'll nurse him back to sleep for a little longer.Around 3 p.m.: More playtime inside, or we go for a walk. Later, if I'm desperate to get dinner cooked and he's clingy, I'll put one of his DVDs in. But I try to reserve those for true desperation. He used to watch them every day, but I started feeling bad about that, so now it's a few times a week.Around 3:30 or 4 p.m.: He nurses again.Around 6 p.m.: Dinner  he gets a stage 2 or 3 meat dinner (he's more likely to finish these, but not always), along with small pieces of veggies, rice, beans, cheese cubes, cereal Os, chicken...whatever we're having that he can have.Three nights a week  usually Tuesday, Thursday, and Saturday  he gets a bath. Depending on when my husband will be home from work, I may try to keep Matthew awake to see Daddy before bed.I sing songs to Matthew and rub him down with eczema cream before I put his pj's on.7 to 8 p.m.: Bedtime. His crib is set up like a sidecar  attached to our bed, with one side open  so we lie next to each other and snuggle, watch his mobile (he has one that projects stars and other stuff onto the ceiling), and nurse until he falls asleep.Matthew still wakes up at least three times a night to nurse  sometimes more like four to six times.Schedule 8: A breastfeeding and pumping working mom of a 9-month-oldEditor's note: This schedule is a parent-led routine6:45 a.m.: Our baby wakes up, nurses, and plays on the floor of our room while we get ready for work.7:30 a.m.: We all have breakfast. The baby has homemade baby food and finger foods.7:45 a.m. Our nanny arrives and we leave for work. I only have a 15-minute drive. After we leave, our son has playtime with the nanny.8:30 a.m.: He naps for about an hour and a half.10 a.m.: He has a 4-ounce bottle of breast milk, then playtime. I pump at work.12:30 p.m.: I zip home from work and nurse. If I can't make it he gets a bottle of breast milk and I pump. After nursing or a bottle, he has lunch  generally finger foods, like small pieces of veggies, cheese, meats, crackers, and so on. Then he has playtime.1:30 p.m.: He naps for almost 2 hours.4 p.m.: He has a 4-ounce bottle of breast milk. I pump at work.6 p.m.: I get home from work.6:30 p.m.: We all have dinner. The baby has homemade baby food and small pieces of whatever we're having. Then it's playtime until bed.8 p.m.: He has a bath and playtime with Dad, then I nurse him (but not to sleep  he falls asleep on his own). He sleeps all night.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Introducing solids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_introducing-solids_113.bc,"When should I introduce solid food to my baby?As long as your baby shows signs of readiness, your child's doctor may say you can start solids any time around 4 to 6 months. Until then, breast milk or formula provides all the calories and nourishment your baby needs  and can handle. Infants don't yet have the physical skills to swallow solid foods safely, and their digestive system simply isn't ready for solids until they're about 4 months old.(Note that there's some controversy on this topic.While the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) section on breastfeeding recommends that babies be exclusively breastfed for the first six months, the AAP's nutrition section and guidelines for pediatricians recommend starting solids at 4 to 6 months.)How can I tell when my baby's ready for solid food?Your baby will give you clear signs when he's ready to move beyond a liquid diet. Cues to look for include:Head control. Your baby needs to be able to keep his head in a steady, upright position.Sitting well when supported. Your baby needs to be able to sit upright in an infant feeding seat or highchair to swallow well.Losing the ""extrusion reflex."" Your baby's mouth and tongue develop in sync with his digestive system. To start solids, he should be able to move food to the back of his mouth and swallow it, instead of using his tongue to push food out of his mouth.Significant weight gain. He may be ready to eat solids if he's doubled his birth weight, weighs at least 13 pounds, and is at least 4 months old.Curiosity about food. Your baby may begin eyeing or reaching for your food or may open his mouth if you offer him a spoonful.7 signs your baby is ready for solid foods Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:57Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:57Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Watch for these signs that usually indicate when babies are ready to try their first food. See all videosWhich solid foods should I feed my baby first?Each baby is different, so talk to your child's doctor about which solids to introduce and when. Most infants can start with any pureed single-ingredient food with no added salt or sugar. Although it's customary in many American families to start babies on infant cereal, there's no medical evidence showing that this offers any advantages or health benefits.If your baby is breastfed, the AAP suggests meat as a first food because the iron in beef, chicken, and turkey helps to replace her iron stores, which start to diminish at about 6 months of age. Other good first foods include pureed sweet potatoes, squash, applesauce, bananas, peaches, and pears.What can I do to minimize the risk of food allergies?Traditional first foods, such as iron-fortified infant cereal, pureed veggies, fruits, and meats, don't typically cause allergic reactions, but observe your baby for signs of allergy, just in case.Once you've tried a few of these foods and your baby seems to be tolerating them well, you can introduce more allergenic foods, such as soy, eggs, wheat, fish, and peanut butter. According to the American Academy of Allergy Asthma and Immunology (AAAAI), introducing allergenic foods around 4 to 6 months may actually help prevent the development of food allergies later on.Special precautions need to be taken with certain babies. If your child falls into any of the following categories, consult with your baby's doctor or an allergist to create a customized feeding plan before adding solids to your baby's diet:Your baby has a sibling with a peanut allergy.Your baby has moderate to severe eczema despite following a doctor's treatment plan.Your baby previously had an immediate allergic reaction to a new food or has been diagnosed with a food allergy.Your baby's blood test was positive for an allergy to a specific food.Guide to Firsts: Solid foodOur checklist helps you get ready to feed your baby.How should I introduce solid food to my baby?For your first few feedings, give him just 1 or 2 teaspoons of pureed solid food or infant cereal after nursing or bottle-feeding.Use a soft-tipped plastic spoon to feed your baby to avoid injuring his gums. Put a small amount of food on the tip of the spoon and offer it to him. If your baby doesn't seem very interested, just let him smell the food for now and try again another time.If you're feeding your baby ready-to-eat jars or pouches of baby food, put some into a small dish and feed him from that. (If you dip his feeding spoon into the jar, it's not a good idea to save the leftovers because bacteria from his mouth will now be in the jar.) Throw away any open baby food jars within a day or two of opening them.If you decide to start with cereal, give him 1 to 2 teaspoons of diluted infant cereal. Add breast milk or formula to a tiny pinch of cereal. It will be very runny at first, but as your baby starts to eat more solid foods, you can gradually thicken the consistency by using less liquid.How to introduce new foods to your baby Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 0:51Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -0:51Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosBegin with one daily feeding whenever your baby is not too tired, hungry, or cranky). Your baby may not eat much at first, but give him time to get used to the experience. Some babies need practice keeping food in their mouths and swallowing.Eventually you can start giving him more solid food until he's up to a few tablespoons a day, over two feedings.(Note that most parents start solids by spoon-feeding their baby infant cereal or purees. But some parents use an alternative technique known as baby-led weaning, in which you put large chunks of soft food directly on the highchair tray or table, and let your baby grasp the food and feed himself. See our article on baby-led weaning for guidelines on how this technique works.)See our age-by-age baby feeding guide to find out what you can expect next.How do I introduce each new food to my baby?Introduce solids gradually, one at a time. Offer your baby a new food a few times over the course of three to five days before trying another new food. This way you'll be able to tell if your baby has an allergic reaction to something.Although you want your baby to eat a wide variety of foods, it takes time for her to get used to each new taste and texture. And each baby will have individual food preferences, but in general, your baby could start the transition with pureed or semi-liquid food, then move on to strained or mashed food, and finally graduate to small pieces of finger foods.If your baby is moving on from cereal, offer a few tablespoons of vegetables or fruit in the same meal as a cereal feeding (or mix them together). All food should be very mushy  at this stage your baby will press the food against the top of her mouth before swallowing it.What are the signs of a food allergy?If your baby is allergic to a new food, you'll see signs of a reaction within a few minutes or hours. Most children with food allergies have mild reactions. If you notice hives, vomiting, or diarrhea, call your baby's doctor for advice.If you notice wheezing, difficulty breathing, or facial swelling (including the tongue and lips), your baby may be having a life-threatening reaction called anaphylaxis. Call 911 or your local emergency number immediately.How can I tell when my baby is full?Your baby's appetite will vary from one feeding to the next, so a strict accounting of how much he's eaten isn't a reliable way to tell when he's had enough. Look for these signs that he's probably done:Leans back in his chairTurns his head away from foodStarts playing with the spoonRefuses to open up for the next bite (Sometimes a baby will keep his mouth closed because he hasn't yet finished with the first mouthful, so give him time to swallow.)Do I still need to give my baby breast milk or formula?Yes, breast milk or formula will still provide the majority of your baby's calories and nutrition until she's a year old. Both provide important vitamins, iron, and protein in a form that's easy to digest. Solid food can't replace the nutrients that breast milk or formula provides during that first year.See how much breast milk or formula babies need after starting solids.Solid food feeding tipsOffer sweets or savories in any order. Some parents may tell you to start with vegetables instead of fruits so your infant won't develop a taste for sweets. But babies are born with a preference for sweets, so you don't have to worry about introducing sweet or savory foods in any particular order.Feed cereal with a spoon only. Unless your baby's doctor asks you to, don't add cereal to his bottle  he could choke or end up gaining too much weight.Encourage adventurous eating. Don't leave any food off his menu simply because you don't like it.Give new foods time. If your baby turns away from a particular food, don't push. Try again in a week or so. He may never like sweet potatoes, or he may change his mind and end up loving them.Know the choking hazards. Don't give your baby foods that might make him choke.Watch for constipation. A baby's stool sometimes changes when his diet does. Although it's usually temporary, your baby may have constipation after introducing solids. If you notice that your baby is having less frequent bowel movements, or that his stools have become hard or dry and seem difficult to pass, let his doctor know. Some doctors recommend adding high-fiber fruits such as pears, prunes, and peaches to a baby's diet, or giving him a few ounces of prune, apple, or pear juice each day until his bowel movements are back to normal.Also, don't be surprised if your baby's stools change color and odor when you add solids to his diet. If your baby has been exclusively breastfed up to this point, you'll probably notice a strong odor to his formerly mild-smelling stools as soon as he starts eating even tiny amounts of solids. This is normal.How many times a day should my baby eat solid food?At first she'll eat solid food just once a day. By around 6 to 7 months, two meals a day is the norm. Starting around 8 to 9 months, she may be eating solid food three times a day. A typical day's diet at 8 months might include a combination of:Breast milk or iron-fortified formulaIron-fortified cerealVegetablesFruitSmall amounts of protein, such as eggs, cheese, yogurt, poultry, lentils, tofu, and meatThere are certain foods that you shouldn't give your baby yet. Honey, for example, can cause botulism in babies less than a year old. And babies should wait until after their first birthday to try cow's milk or soy milk.What equipment do I need to feed solids to my baby?It's helpful to have:A highchairPlastic dishes and bowlsPlastic spoons to protect your baby's sensitive gumsBibsA splat mat on the floorYou may also want to introduce your baby to a sippy cup soon after you start solids.What do I need to make homemade baby food?If you're making your own baby food, you'll need:A tool to puree the food, like a blender, food processor, or baby food grinderStorage containers for refrigerating and freezing extra portions (Some parents use ice cube trays  or similar devices made just for baby food  to store and freeze individual portions.)Where should I feed solids to my baby?You'll want a sturdy, stable, comfy place for him to sit, at a convenient height for you. To start out, that might be a bouncy seat or even a car seat. (Just make sure that he's upright enough to swallow well.)However, once he can sit up by himself, a highchair at the table is your best bet. That way, your baby can be a part of family meals, and you'll be able to eat and feed him at the same time. It's also easier to clean up after he chows down.How can I help my child develop healthy eating habits?Don't feel like you have to stick to bland, boring baby foods  get ideas for more adventurous options to give your child, or learn how to make your own baby food.See our new rules for feeding your baby and the old guidelines that still apply.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012.

Top 7 mommy guilt trips - and how to handle them,https://www.babycenter.com/0_top-7-mommy-guilt-trips-and-how-to-handle-them_3654967.bc,"Mommy guilt is like PMS  we all get it from time to time. In fact, a whopping 94 percent of moms in a recent BabyCenter survey fessed up to feeling shame over issues ranging from the amount of time they spend with their kids to the kind of diapers they use.Mommy guilt is an equal-opportunity affliction, the experts say  it strikes whether you're 20 or 40, CEO of your home or a Fortune 500 company, living in the big city or on Main Street USA.""We found that moms from all walks of life have mommy guilt, which blows the 'grass is greener' thing right out of the water,"" say Devra Renner and Aviva Pflock, coauthors of Mommy Guilt: Learn to Worry Less, Focus on What Matters Most, and Raise Happier Kids.But guilt can actually serve as a helpful tool  as long as you don't take it too far. ""It can provide a check and balance,"" says Pflock. ""The trick is that you want to be in control of the guilt, rather than letting the guilt control you.""To help you take charge of your own mommy guilt, we've given a rundown of the most common mom cringe-inducers and what to do about them.1. Feeding your baby formulaYou pull out a bottle to feed your crying baby and notice raised eyebrows all around. It turns out that the other moms you're with all breastfeed exclusively.Soothe it! You may feel like you're the only formula-feeding mom in the universe, but this is far from the truth. Whether it's due to supply issues, latch-on problems, going back to work, or something else entirely, many mothers find themselves relying on formula to supplement or replace breastfeeding.According to the Centers for Disease Control, 42 percent of U.S. moms are breastfeeding at 6 months and 22 percent at a year. And in a BabyCenter poll, 67 percent of moms said their babies had formula in the first six months. In other words, there's a lot of the stuff floating around.And still, we feel bad: In that same poll, 79 percent of moms who'd stopped nursing said they felt guilty about it. ""After a few weeks of crying more than my infant, I finally switched to formula. But now I'm consumed with guilt,"" says one mom. ""Everywhere I look, even on formula packages, breastfeeding is touted as best.""If you're grieving the loss of nursing, allow yourself your sadness. But then accept that you did your best, and move on. Breast milk is best for your baby, but formula-fed babies are also thriving, nourished, and nurtured. As one BabyCenter mom says, ""The best thing you can do for your baby is to be a happy mom  and if that means no breastfeeding, then that's the best choice for your family.""2. Using TV as a babysitterTime to cook dinner, so you plop the kids down in front of the tube so they won't be underfoot. They're happy, but you feel a pang of guilt as you see their jaws go slack and their eyes get that faraway look.Soothe it! In 2003, the American Academy of Pediatrics announced that children under 2 shouldn't watch any television. No more popping in a DVD while you grab a shower, no more cuddling on the couch and watching kids' programs.This recommendation became instant fodder for mommy guilt. ""I started letting my son watch educational programs when he was 1 and he still watches DVDs. But after reading about not allowing any TV for kids under 2, I'm panicking!"" says one BabyCenter mom.But if you break this rule, you're not alone: A poll of BabyCenter moms reveals that only 10 percent of moms with toddlers forbid TV completely. Sixty-seven percent think it's okay to let babies watch some TV, and 69 percent let their child watch the TV shows and DVDs they're watching. But the shame is still in play: 26 percent of moms lie about how much TV their children watch!Is television really so evil? No, say Renner and Pflock: ""Using television entertainment as a form of quiet time is perfectly appropriate."" The key is moderation. If your child is under 2, keep viewing time to a minimum, and break it into 15-minute chunks. Watch with your child, and pick programs that are appropriate. If your child is older, see our TV guidelines for preschoolers and big kids. Then relax and send your guilt on its way. What are your ""bad mommy"" moments?Real moms confess their darkest secrets and guilty pleasures. 3. Being environmentally unfriendlyAs you throw out a trash bag bursting with disposable diapers and Styrofoam cups, you spot your neighbor hanging cloth diapers on her clothesline. Her new hybrid is parked on the street, not far from your gas-guzzler.Soothe it! It can seem like Kermit the Frog was singing directly to us parents when he warbled: ""It's not that easy bein' green."" Conveniences like disposable diapers and wipes, bottles of water, and paper towels can feel essential when we're stretching to keep our family's life humming along smoothly. And having kids usually leads to consuming more resources like water, electricity, and gasoline.But raising children can also make us more conscious of our impact on the earth  47 percent of parents in a BabyCenter poll are more concerned about the environment since having kids. And 55 percent are ""extremely"" or ""very"" concerned about environmental issues. After all, we want the world to be in the best shape possible for our kids.This push and pull can lead to a nasty case of green guilt. Let this be a wake-up call  but know that letting guilt devour you won't do you or the earth any good. You may not be able to take public transportation to work, switch to cloth diapers, hang your laundry on the line, or toss out all your environmentally unfriendly cleaners right now.Instead, focus on the dozens of achievable changes you can make. Try unplugging appliances when they're not in use, doing your laundry in cold water when possible, lighting your home with fluorescent bulbs, and other easy, earth-friendly tricks. Don't worry too much about the Greens next door  maybe someday soon you'll be giving them tips.4. Feeding your kids junk foodAt the end of a long, stressful day, the drive-through calls. But as you hand the crinkly bags back to your now-ecstatic children, you think about your own mother, who never did this.Soothe it! Sure, there are kids out there who don't know a French fry from a French twist. Maybe you even used to be one of them. If your own kids can sniff out a fry from a mile away, though, rest assured that you're not alone  76 percent of BabyCenter parents say they rely on fast food a few times a month or more.Sometimes we forget that fast food  while not usually the best nutritional option  isn't poisonous. As with television, the key is moderation and smart choices.Eating fast food as often as twice a week is fine as long as you choose relatively low-fat options, says Mary Savoye-Desanti, a bionutritionist at Yale University and director of the Bright Bodies Program.That could mean ordering a regular single-patty hamburger instead of a double-patty burger loaded with sauce and cheese, a sandwich with chicken that's grilled rather than fried, a pizza with extra vegetables and less cheese instead of pepperoni, or a baked potato or side salad in place of fries. Get more tips and nutritional information from major fast-food chains.If your family is turning to fast food more often than meals prepared at home, however, make some changes. You can serve healthy foods without spending hours in the kitchen  try prepared foods from the grocery store like roasted chicken, sliced roast beef, and bagged salads.When you do take your kids to the drive-through, let them know that fast food is a ""once in a while"" thing. Then shoo your guilt out the car window. 5. Leaving your child with another caregiverIt's the first day of daycare and your baby seems fine  but you're a wreck. Tears drip down your face as you stop for one last kiss, and you drive to work fighting the urge to turn around.Soothe it! Working moms often struggle with intense guilt  especially when they first go back. ""Since I was returning to a job I loved, I thought I'd feel happy and worthwhile. I didn't expect those feelings to be so tempered by guilt,"" says mom Johanna Villanueva.Working moms can also feel guilty for wanting to work. Tela Durbin of Working Moms Against Guilt was tearful and upset when she left her son at daycare  but she also felt relieved to have some time away from his colic. ""I had two kinds of guilt  guilt for leaving him and guilt for wanting the break,"" she says.If you're in this position, know that studies have shown time and time again that good childcare can promote cognitive, language, and social skills. Relieve your guilt by choosing the best daycare center, home daycare, babysitter, or nanny that you can.To ease the transition, become familiar with your care provider before you go back to work, says Durbin. ""Do practice runs. Maybe even leave your child there for a few hours while you run an errand.""Stay away from the online ""mommy wars"" between working and at-home moms, and tune out any judgmental comments you may receive. This vulnerable period is no time to jump into the fray. There are many online groups for working moms where you can find support  turn to one of these instead.And finally, remember that your work serves a crucial purpose. As Durbin says, ""You know you're doing what's best for your family, whether you're working for financial reasons or because it makes you happy."" 6. Yelling at your kidsYour toddler starts shrieking moments after your baby finally goes down for her nap. ""Don't wake the baby!"" you snap, much louder than you meant to. Your toddler looks at you with wide, frightened eyes.Soothe it! No one feels good about yelling at their kids. In fact, Pflock and Renner's survey of mothers found that yelling is the number one cause of mommy guilt.When this happens, take a careful look at your own behavior. Was the yelling out of the ordinary? Are you usually calm with your child? If yes, then let yourself off the hook and take this as a learning opportunity for both of you. As Elizabeth Pantley says in The No-Cry Discipline Solution, ""Even the most peaceful easy-going parent loses patience and yells from time to time.""Reassure your child that everything is okay, and explain what happened: ""Sometimes people yell when they're upset. But that can hurt people's feelings. I'm sorry. It would have been better if I had said 'Please be quiet. The baby is sleeping.'""But if screaming is becoming a habit, you may need to take action to manage your anger and reduce your stress levels. Join a support group, see a counselor, read relevant books and articles, or get help from moms in our Community. You can also check out tips on avoiding yelling from BabyCenter moms.""I ended up talking to a therapist, and he showed me that it was all about stress,"" says one BabyCenter mom of her yelling habit. ""I committed to finding ways of reducing stress  I gave up some work, exercised more, got a little more relaxed about the housework. It was very hard, because I'm a control freak, but it paid off.""7. Not being able to afford all the extrasYour mommy friends have all signed up for a popular  and expensive  kids' music class. You'd love to join, but you can't afford it. You gloomily envision their children playing in the symphony, while your own child mops up their sweat.Soothe it! It's easy to feel bad when you can't afford an activity for your child, or when you're the only mom in the playground with a plain stroller rather than a deluxe model loaded with bells and whistles.But many of the things that we think of as ""necessary"" aren't. What kids really need is love  not the next expensive activity or ""It toy."" In fact, too much stuff can be a problem. ""If you're constantly overindulging your children, they'll never learn the value of money,"" explains psychotherapist Kate Levinson, who leads workshops for women to explore their emotional relationship to money. ""You also want to teach them how to enjoy life and solve problems in ways that don't have to do with buying things or using money.""Instead of focusing on what you can't give your child, focus on what he can have. For example, instead of the high-end music class, try a free class or library story time. If he loves to ""cook"" but you can't afford a play kitchen, help him make one out of a cardboard box. You'll probably feel your guilt drain away as you watch him happily banging on his new stove.More:""Bad mommy"" moments: See the photosAvoiding new-mom comparison traps"
Weaning: When and how to stop breastfeeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_weaning-when-and-how-to-stop-breastfeeding_3272.bc,"What does it mean to have weaned a child?Your baby is considered weaned when he stops nursing and gets all his nutrition from sources other than the breast. Although babies are also weaned from the bottle, the term usually refers to when a baby stops breastfeeding.Weaning doesn't necessarily signal the end of the intimate bond you and your child created through nursing. It just means you're nourishing and nurturing him in different ways.For example, if you often nursed your child for comfort, you'll have to find other ways to make him feel better. Read a book, sing a song together, or play outside instead. If your child protests, try to stay calm and be firm. If you need to, hand him to your partner for a cuddle.When should I start weaning?You're the best judge of when it's time to wean, and you don't have to set a deadline until you and your child are ready. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that mothers breastfeed for at least a year  and encourages women to breastfeed even longer if both you and your baby want to.Despite what friends, relatives, or even strangers may say, there's no right or wrong way to wean. You can choose a time that feels right to you, or let your child wean naturally when she's older.Baby-led weaning: Weaning is easiest when your child begins to lose interest in nursing, and that can happen any time after she starts eating solids (around 4 to 6 months). Some babies are more interested in solid food than breast milk by 12 months, after they've tried a variety of foods and can drink from a cup.Toddlers may become less interested in nursing when they grow more active and aren't inclined to sit still long enough to nurse. If your child is fussy and impatient while nursing or is easily distracted, she may be giving you signs that she's ready.Mother-led weaning: You may decide to start weaning because you're returning to work. Or maybe it just feels like the right time. If you're ready but your child isn't showing signs she wants to stop nursing, you can wean her off the breast gradually.When it's the mother's idea, weaning can take a lot of time and patience. It also depends on your child's age and how she adjusts to change.It's a good idea to avoid the 'cold turkey' approach to weaning. For example, a weekend away from your baby or toddler is not a good way to end the breastfeeding relationship. Experts say that abruptly withholding your breast can be traumatic for your baby and could cause plugged ducts or a breast infection for you.How do I wean?Go slowly, and expect to see signs of frustration from your baby at first. Ease the transition by using these methods:Skip a feeding. See what happens if you offer a bottle or cup of milk instead of nursing. You can substitute pumped breast milk, formula, or whole cow's milk (if your child is at least a year old).Reducing feedings one at a time over a period of weeks gives your child time to adjust. Your milk supply also diminishes gradually this way, without leaving your breasts engorged or causing mastitis.Shorten nursing time. Start by limiting how long your child is on the breast. If he usually nurses for ten minutes, try five.Depending on his age, follow the feeding with a healthy snack, such as unsweetened applesauce or a cup of milk or formula. (Some babies younger than 6 months may not be ready for solids.) Solid food is complementary to breast milk until your baby is a year old.Bedtime feedings may be harder to shorten because they're usually the last to go.Postpone and distract. Try postponing feedings if you're only nursing a couple of times a day.This method works well if you have an older child you can reason with. If your child asks to nurse, reassure him that you will soon and distract him with a different activity. If he wants to nurse in the early evening, explain that he has to wait until bedtime.To ease your baby's transition to a bottle, try putting a few drops of breast milk on his lips or tongue before slipping the bottle's nipple into his mouth. You can also try giving him a small amount of breast milk in a bottle a couple of hours after breastfeeding but before he's so hungry that he's impatient and frustrated.Will my child get enough nutrients?Even exclusively breastfed infants need extra nutrients that breast milk can't provide, like vitamin D. If you wean your baby before she reaches her first birthday, she'll need to continue to drink breast milk or iron-fortified formula until she's a year old. Then once your child reaches toddlerhood, it'll be necessary to give her a wider variety of foods that offer the range of nutrients she needs to help her grow.What to do when weaning becomes a struggleIf you've tried everything to wean your child and nothing is working, maybe the time isn't right.Have you recently gone back to work? Your child may still be adjusting to the new routine.Is your child sick? Babies often want to nurse more frequently when they don't feel well. And breastfeeding a sick child is not only comforting, but also a good source of nutrition.Is your household going through a major life change? Events such as a move or divorce can also make weaning more difficult. Even going through a new developmental stage can make it hard to wean.Try again in another month. Sooner or later, it'll happen.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015. Weaning your baby.

Doctor visit: The 1-month checkup,https://www.babycenter.com/0_doctor-visit-the-1-month-checkup_6599.bc,"Find out what to expect at this well-baby checkup. Download a printable version of our 1-month checkup worksheet to take with you. You may want to read through the questions and jot down answers beforehand.What the doctor will doWeigh and measure your babyYou'll need to undress your baby completely for weighing. The doctor weighs your baby, measures length and head circumference, and plots the numbers on a growth chart.The chart enables you to see how your baby compares with other children the same age. But it doesn't matter whether he's in the 5th or the 95th percentile, as long as his rate of growth is steady from one visit to the next.Do a complete physicalHeart and lungs: Uses a stethoscope to listen for any abnormal heart rhythms or breathing problems.Eyes: Checks for signs of congenital eye conditions and other problems. May also check for blocked tear ducts and discharge.Ears: Looks for signs of infection and observes how your baby responds to sound.Mouth: Looks for signs of thrush (an oral yeast infection) among other things.Head: Checks the soft spots (fontanels) and the shape of your baby's head.Body: Checks your baby's reflexes and muscle tone, and examines his skin for jaundice, rashes, and birthmarks.Belly: Makes sure the umbilical cord stump has fallen off and the belly button is healing well. Presses gently on the abdomen to check for a hernia or any enlarged organs.Genitals: Opens your baby's diaper and checks for signs of infection. If your baby is a boy, the doctor looks to see if his testes have descended into the scrotum. If your son was circumcised, the doctor examines his penis to make sure it's healing well.Hips and legs: Moves your baby's legs around to look for problems in the hip joints.Give your baby his shotsYour baby will probably get a hepatitis B shot. Most babies receive their first hep B shot a birth, the second at their 1 or 2 month checkup, and their third sometime between 6 and 18 months.An assistant may administer the shot. It's usually done at the end of the appointment so you can have some privacy afterward to comfort your baby.Address any other concernsYour doctor will recommend giving vitamin D drops to breastfed babies. (Babies who drink 17 to 32 ounces of formula a day are getting enough vitamin D.)The doctor will also address any noticeable health concerns (diaper rash and cradle cap are common at this stage), ask you some questions (see below), and help you understand what's normal at this age.Questions the doctor may ask:How is your baby sleeping? Normal sleeping patterns are still erratic this month, but most babies will sleep in two- to three-hour chunks during the day and night for a total of about 15 hours. By now one period of sleep may be a little longer than the others  that's the first step toward a full night's rest for the baby and you.What position does your baby sleep in? To reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), put your baby to sleep on her back.When, how, and how often is your baby eating? Most 1-month-olds eat every two to three hours. The doctor asks these questions to determine whether your baby is getting enough breast milk or formula to thrive, and to see if you have any concerns about feeding.What are your baby's bowel movements like? Soft feces are best, but color can vary. Dry or pellet-like stools are a sign of dehydration, or a sign of constipation in a formula-fed infant. Tell your doctor if you notice this.Does your baby quiet down, at least briefly, at the sound of your voice? This behavior tells you and the doctor two things: Your baby is beginning to recognize you, and she sees you as a source of comfort and nurturing.Is your baby awake for longer periods of time? There's no right amount of alert time, but a general trend toward longer periods of alertness is a sign that your baby's developing normally.Does she make soft cooing noises when she's content and alert? It's still several months before she'll utter her first real words, but these happy baby sounds are the first step.Have you noticed anything unusual about your baby's eyes or the way she looks at things? At every well-baby visit, the doctor should check the structure and alignment of the eyes and your baby's ability to move them correctly.Is she a little fussier at the end of the day? It's normal for 1-month-olds to fuss in the evening, especially between 6 p.m. and midnight. As your baby starts staying awake for longer periods during the day, she'll begin feeling more tired and irritable at night.Are you giving your baby tummy time when she's awake? Start tummy time from day one  when your child is awake and you're watching her, of course. Time on the tummy helps babies learn to push up, roll over, and eventually crawl. It also helps them avoid getting a flat spot on the back of the head. If you start it right away, your baby is less likely to resist it.Does your baby hold her head up when placed on her tummy? Head control is an important developmental milestone. If your baby can't hold her head up at least briefly by now, tell the doctor.How are you doing? Your child's doctor will screen you for signs of postpartum depression and ask questions about stressors on your family and how much of a support network you have.What's next?Find out what's in store for you at the 2-month doctor visit.View and print a clean copy of the 1-month doctor visit worksheet."
Foods that can be unsafe for your baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_foods-that-can-be-unsafe-for-your-baby_9195.bc,"As your baby grows, he'll be eager to sample food from your plate  and you'll be eager to introduce some variety to his diet. But not all foods are safe for your child. Some pose a choking hazard, and a few aren't good for your baby's still-developing digestive system.Foods to avoid: Birth to 4 to 6 monthsAll food and beverages except breast milk or formula: The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends feeding your baby only breast milk or formula for the first four to six months.Foods to avoid: 4 to 12 monthsHoney: Honey can harbor spores of Clostridium botulinum, which causes botulism. An adult's intestinal tract can prevent the growth of these spores, but in a baby the spores can grow and produce life-threatening toxins.Cow's milk and soy milk: Stick with breast milk or formula until your child's first birthday. Why? Your baby can't digest the proteins in cow's milk and soy milk during her first year, and these beverages contain minerals in amounts that can damage her kidneys.Baby-led weaning: 9 great finger foods Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:49Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:49Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

The AAP recommends that you cut food into pieces no larger than 1/2 inch. For example, cut up fruits such as grapes, cherry tomatoes, and strawberries, and shred or finely chop meats, vegetables, and cheeses.Raw vegetables: Soft-cook vegetables such as carrots, celery, and broccoli, and dice, shred, or cut them into pieces no larger than 1/2 inch before serving.Nuts and seeds: Remove seeds and pits from fresh fruit such as watermelon, peaches, plums, and cherries before serving. And don't feed your baby nuts or seeds, such as sunflower or pumpkin seeds. Seeds may be too small to choke on but can get stuck in a child's airway and cause an infection.Hard or crunchy foods: Nuts, popcorn, and pretzels are all choking hazards, as are all hard candies and cough drops.Sticky foods: Chewing gum and sticky foods  such as jelly or gummy candies, dried fruit, and marshmallows  can get lodged in your baby's throat. Stringy, melted cheese can also be a choking hazard.Nut butter: The sticky consistency of peanut butter and other nut butters can make it hard for your baby to swallow it. Spread nut butter thinly on bread or crackers. Or thin it with water or applesauce.Learn more about preventing choking in young children.Find out about choosing safe finger foods and which foods can be unsafe for toddlers and children up to age 5.The latest on children and food allergiesDoctors used to recommend waiting until age 1 or even later to introduce solid foods that are common allergens, especially with children at risk for allergies. But the AAP has changed its tune, because studies show that these delays don't help prevent allergies and may even increase the risk of them.It's still a wise idea, though, to introduce new foods gradually, waiting several days after each new menu item to make sure your baby doesn't react badly to it. And if you believe that your baby is likely to have food allergies  for example, if allergies run in your family or your baby has eczema  check with his doctor to determine the best strategy for introducing allergenic foods, which include eggs, milk, peanuts, wheat, soy, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish.Read more about food allergies in children.Show sources Hide sources Academy of Nutrition and Dietrics. 2014.

Gas pain in toddlers,https://www.babycenter.com/0_gas-pain-in-toddlers_1201487.bc,"Is it normal for children to have intestinal gas?Intestinal gas is a perfectly normal occurrence in children and in adults. (We grown-ups pass, on average, 2 liters of gas a day, and it can be as high as 8 liters a day.) In most cases, it isn't a cause for concern, unless your child is experiencing more than minor discomfort and complaining a lot.How can my child get relief from gas pain?Typically, a child with gas has bloating, pain, or burning in his belly, and frequent burping or flatulence. He may also feel a bit of nausea. It most likely only happens once in a while  for example, after he's overindulged at a birthday party.But it's also possible that particular foods or eating habits are to blame. The best thing you can do in that case is to try to eliminate or manage the offending food or habit that's triggering your child's gas.When your child does have uncomfortable gas pain, you can give him an over-the-counter ant-gas medicine (such as a simethicone product). These are safe for children of all ages.Heartburn and indigestion often accompany gas and cause abdominal pain. If your child is dealing with these, and your child is at least 6 months old, you can try an antacid (which neutralizes stomach acid). Look for an antacid that doesn't contain aluminum, as antacids with aluminum aren't recommended for children.Ask your pharmacist to help you find an anti-gas medication or antacid that's appropriate for your child.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.What could be causing my child's gas?Several factors could cause your child to have more gas or indigestion than usual:Roaming around during mealsMany time-crunched parents find themselves doing anything they can think of to get their kids to eat right  including letting them meander around house, watch television, or even roughhouse during meals.""When kids roam and play while they eat, they can get excited and trap air in their intestinal tracts during mealtime,"" says Michael Hart, director of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition at Carilion Clinic Children's Hospital in Roanoke, Virginia, and a professor of pediatrics at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine.If your child is a roamer, she probably eats fast or gulps so that chewing won't impede her playing. That also increases air consumption and isn't good for digestion. And if she has meals while watching television, she might ignore her body's signals that she's full and overeat.Encourage your child to sit at the table with you during meals, chew her food well, and take her time when eating. Reassure her that she'll have time to play after the meal.Eating a lot of high-fiber foods, like cereal, or fatty foods, like French friesSome children's guts are sensitive to fiber or fat. Take note of which types of foods bring on your child's bouts of gastrointestinal distress and try limiting them. You might also discuss his diet with his doctor, who may have other suggestions.Ingesting a particular protein in formula or breast milkIf your baby is breastfeeding and having gas pains, she may have an intolerance to a protein in Mom's diet  meaning she has trouble digesting it, resulting in gas and bloating. Elimination of the offending food (such as dairy products) may help.If your baby is formula-fed and seems to be having gas pains, it's possible that she has an intolerance to the cow's milk protein in the formula. If that's the case, her doctor can recommend a hypoallergenic option.Eating certain vegetablesLike adults, children can develop additional gas when they eat foods like beans, broccoli, and cauliflower. If your child eats these healthy foods, that's a good thing. Just make sure you don't overload him with too many gas-inducing veggies at consecutive meals.Drinking a lot of juiceIn general, parents misunderstand the benefits of giving kids juice. If your child is drinking more than a glass a day, it might be causing him to have a little extra gas.Some children have a hard time digesting the fructose and sucrose in juice. As a result, it can bring on gas, even diarrhea. Drinking too much juice can also make a child feel too full to eat nutritious foods at mealtime. Plus, it bathes the teeth in sugar.Ideally, a child under the age of 3 won't drink any juice or soda, says Hart. At most, he should drink no more than one 4-ounce glass of juice a day. Once he's 3 years and older, limit him to one 6- to 8-ounce glass a day.To avoid cavities and obesity, Hart explains, it's preferable to for children to drink only water and milk.For more help choosing healthy beverages for your child, see our slideshow on the best and worst drinks for thirsty kids.Drinking a lot of sodaCarbonated drinks like soda contain phosphoric acid, which can cause excessive gas and indigestion. Soda also tends to make children feel full, so they don't drink the necessary milk and water they should or get all the nutrients they need throughout the day. Try to eliminate soda from your child's diet or at least limit it to special occasions.Not drinking enough waterDrinking water won't eliminate your child's gas problem, but it will help improve any constipation or difficulty she might have passing stools. (Constipation often coincides with gas and abdominal discomfort.)Make sure your child has several glasses of water each day in addition to the milk or juice you give her.Could it be something more serious?If you find yourself treating your child several times a day for more than three consecutive days, or his gas is severe or coincides with other symptoms such as vomiting, diarrhea, loss of appetite, or fever, call your doctor.Your child might have a more serious condition such as inflammatory bowel disease, appendicitis, a food allergy, or lactose intolerance. An illness such as gastroenteritis, strep throat, or a urinary tract infection can also cause abdominal pain, as can constipation.Source: Michael Hart, M.D., director of Pediatric Gastroenterology and Nutrition at Carilion Clinic Children's Hospital and professor of pediatrics at the Virginia Tech Carilion School of Medicine in Roanoke, VirginiaShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2016.

Chronic high blood pressure and breastfeeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_chronic-high-blood-pressure-and-breastfeeding_10415179.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI have high blood pressure. Can I still breastfeed?Yes, breastfeeding has many health benefits for you and your baby, even when you have high blood pressure. Breastfeeding won't make your condition worse, and might even improve it over the long term. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding exclusively for the first six months of your baby's life.If you had high blood pressure before or during your pregnancy, you'll probably need medication to treat it after you have your baby. And what's best for your health may not be good for an infant. Discuss the benefits and risks of breastfeeding and formula feeding with your healthcare provider to find the option that works best for you.Does high blood pressure medication pass into breast milk?Most high blood pressure drugs pass into breast milk in very small amounts. Many drugs used to treat high blood pressure during pregnancy are considered safe to take when nursing, but they're not all the same. For example, some beta-blockers are found in breast milk in higher amounts and may not be ideal to take when breastfeeding.I'm worried about taking high blood pressure medication while I'm breastfeeding. Should I switch to formula?You're not alone  many women with a high-risk pregnancy worry that their baby may be exposed to medication through their breast milk. There are pros and cons to both breastfeeding and formula feeding, so talk to your provider to make the best choice for you and your baby.It's helpful to know some of the benefits of breastfeeding  experts weigh these against any risks when making a recommendation.It might also be reassuring to know that certain blood pressure medications have been prescribed to breastfeeding moms long enough to have a proven safety record. Ask your provider about the medication you're taking, including how much of the drug could pass into your breast milk.Also, diuretic medications used to treat high blood pressure are considered safe for a baby when breastfeeding, but they could affect your milk supply.Could my high blood pressure make it harder to breastfeed?The condition itself won't make it harder to breastfeed, but the consequences of having high blood pressure might. For example, when you have high blood pressure, you're more likely to have a preterm birth, and a premature baby may not be able to latch on to your breast right away. In this case, you may have to pump, which can make breastfeeding difficult for other reasons.Also, when a baby is born early, it can take longer for your milk to come in. But don't give up  the colostrum your breasts produce at first has important antibodies for your baby. Continue feeding or pumping so your baby gets the nutrition he needs, and your milk supply will gradually increase.If you've had a cesarean section, the pain can make breastfeeding more of a challenge. Ask your provider for support, and try different positions until you find one that's comfortable.

Jaundice,https://www.babycenter.com/0_jaundice_89.bc,"I think my baby's skin looks a little yellow. Is this normal?Yes, about 60 percent of full-term babies have a yellowish cast to their skin  called jaundice  during their first week or two of life. In fact, virtually all newborn babies have some jaundice, but it's not always noticeable.For most babies, this is a temporary, harmless condition that goes away on its own or with mild treatment. But in rare cases, it's very serious, so it's important to keep an eye on it.What causes jaundice?High levels of a pigment in the blood called bilirubin cause the skin to look yellow.Everyone's blood contains bilirubin. Bilirubin is one of the byproducts created when old red blood cells break down. Normally, the liver removes bilirubin from the blood and the body then gets rid of it in bowel movements.During pregnancy, the mother's liver eliminates bilirubin for her baby. After birth, it takes a while for the baby's liver to start doing the job. The result: Pigment builds up in the baby's blood and his skin takes on the yellowish cast of jaundice.This type of jaundice, called physiologic jaundice, usually appears on a baby's second or third day of life and disappears on its own within two weeks. (In premature babies, it peaks at 5 to 7 days and may take up to two months to go away.) The yellow color tends to appear first in a baby's face, then move downward to his neck and chest and on down until, in extreme cases, it reaches his toes.  Dr. P. Marazzi / Science SourceCan breastfeeding cause jaundice?Breastfeeding doesn't cause jaundice, but jaundice is more likely to occur in breastfeeding babies.Insufficient liquid causes the concentration of bilirubin in the blood to rise. So if your baby is breastfeeding and not yet getting plenty of breast milk, it's more likely that he'll become jaundiced. (It's possible for a formula-fed baby to get jaundice, too, if he's not getting enough formula.)If you think your baby isn't getting enough breast milk, discuss the feeding problem with your doctor. You may want to work with a lactation consultant on breastfeeding.Once your baby is getting enough breast milk  through improved breastfeeding technique, more frequent feedings, or supplementation with expressed breast milk or formula  the jaundice will likely go away. The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that you breastfeed your baby at least eight to 12 times a day for the first several days.Some babies develop something called ""breast-milk jaundice"" during their first few weeks. It's usually diagnosed at around 7 to 11 days of age.Your baby may be nursing well and gaining weight normally, but something in the breast milk interferes with his liver's ability to process bilirubin. This often happens along with physiologic jaundice, and it can go on for several weeks or even months.Breast-milk jaundice is pretty common in exclusively breastfed babies, and is generally considered harmless. If your baby's bilirubin levels get too high, your baby's doctor may recommend that you stop nursing for a day or two to bring them down. You can use a breast pump to maintain your milk supply during this time, and once the bilirubin level goes down, you can begin breastfeeding again. Can jaundice be dangerous?In the vast majority of cases, jaundice isn't anything to worry about. But if a baby's bilirubin levels get too high, jaundice can cause permanent damage to the nervous system. A very small percentage of jaundiced newborns develop a condition called kernicterus, which can result in deafness, delayed development, or a form of cerebral palsy.Are some babies more prone to jaundice than others?Yes, babies is more likely to have noticeable jaundice if they:has a sibling who had jaundicehad bruises at birth (the red blood cells that are part of the bruises are broken down and produce bilirubin as a byproduct)were born prematurely, because their immature liver may not be able to handle the bilirubin levelsare of East Asian descenthave a certain genetic disorder (such as Gilbert's syndrome; inherited red blood cell membrane defects; or galactosemia, an inherited metabolic disorder)have a certain disease, such as cystic fibrosis or hypothyroidismJaundice during a baby's first 24 hours can also be caused by serious conditions such as liver, gallbladder, and intestinal disorders, an infection, excessive birth trauma, certain diseases, or extreme prematurity (birth before 28 weeks gestation). Rh-incompatibility and blood-type incompatibility can also cause jaundice in the first day.Are there tests for jaundice?Your medical team will examine your baby for jaundice at birth. Ideally, they should also look at him three to five days after birth, when his bilirubin levels are likely to be highest.If there's any concern that your baby is jaundiced, his doctor may do a skin test or blood test to check his bilirubin levels. (The test will definitely be done if your baby appears jaundiced in the first 24 hours, because jaundice that appears then is more likely to be a problem.)If you leave the hospital soon after your baby's birth, though, you and your baby may be home by the time jaundice shows up, and you may be the first to notice it.Here's how to check for jaundice: Take your baby into a room with plenty of natural or fluorescent light. If your child is fair-skinned, gently press your finger to his forehead, nose, or chest, and look for a yellow tinge to the skin as the pressure is released. If your child has dark skin, check for yellowness in his gums or the whites of his eyes.When should I call the doctor?Talk with the doctor if your baby's skin is yellowish, especially if the whites of his eyes, his tummy, or his arms or legs are yellow. Also call the doctor if your baby is jaundiced and becomes hard to wake or fussy, or doesn't want to eat, and if he has even a mild case of jaundice for more than three weeks. When is jaundice considered serious?If a baby develops jaundice in the first 24 hours after birth, it's always considered serious and he'll need close monitoring and treatment. This type of jaundice is uncommon, though, and is usually due to a blood-type incompatibility between mom and the baby.If your blood type is O or Rh-negative, it may be incompatible with your baby's blood type. During your first prenatal appointment, your practitioner probably checked your blood type to see if you were at risk for this, but there's no way to know for sure until your baby is born and you find out what his blood type is.If your healthcare provider is concerned about incompatible blood types, a blood sample will be taken from your baby at birth to find out his blood type. (Some providers wait to do a blood test until a baby shows signs of developing jaundice, since he may be fine even if your blood types aren't compatible.)A ""Coombs test"" will also be done, to see if an incompatibility has affected your baby's blood cells. If your baby does have a blood-type incompatibility or a positive Coombs test, he'll be watched closely for jaundice.How is jaundice treated?Most jaundice needs no treatment, but when it does, phototherapy (light therapy) is considered very safe and effective: Placing a baby naked in a bassinet, with his eyes covered, under blue ""bililights"" often does the trick, because ultraviolet light changes the bilirubin to a form that the baby can more easily dispose of in his urine.Another option involves wrapping the baby in a fiber-optic blanket called a bili-blanket or bili-pad. With a prescription from your doctor, you may be able to rent one of these blankets to treat your baby at home.Phototherapy is usually effective, but if a baby develops a severe case of jaundice, or his bilirubin levels continue to rise despite phototherapy treatment, he may need to be admitted to the intensive care unit for a blood transfusion called an ""exchange transfusion."" This transfusion replaces some of the baby's blood that contains high bilirubin levels with donor blood containing normal levels.Something else you can do on your own to help reduce jaundice is make sure that your baby is getting plenty of breast milk or formula, so he'll have frequent bowel movements. If you have any concerns about jaundice, check with his doctor to make sure you're taking the right steps to get your baby back in the pink.Show sources Hide sources AAP. Undated. Jaundice.

Failure to gain weight in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_failure-to-gain-weight-in-babies_1621.bc,"My baby isn't gaining weight as fast as he was. Should I be worried?Probably not, but it's a good idea to keep an eye on your baby's growth chart. Remember that while your baby should gain weight steadily  with the exception of her first few days, when she may even lose a bit before quickly catching up  it won't always be a perfectly smooth climb.Your baby's growth rate will speed up and slow down. It may even stop temporarily  when she's ill, for example. But overall you should see the ounces and pounds piling on.If you're at all concerned that your baby isn't gaining enough weight, talk with her doctor right away.What will the doctor do?The doctor will give your baby a physical exam and ask you a number of questions to help determine whether there's a problem, and, if so, what the underlying cause might be. She'll look at many factors in addition to your baby's growth rate to assess how he's doing.If your baby is hitting his developmental milestones pretty much on time, relating well to you, and looking otherwise happy and healthy, he's most likely doing fine.If the doctor finds that your baby isn't growing at a healthy rate, however, she may diagnose him with ""failure to gain weight"" or ""failure to thrive."" The criteria she'll use to make this diagnosis may include:falling below the third percentile for weight on his growth chartweighing 20 percent below the ideal weight for his heighta decrease of two or more major percentile lines on his growth chart since his last checkupBy the way, while failure to gain weight can happen to any baby, premature babies are at a higher risk than full-term babies.If your baby has failure to gain weight, it's very important to find out why. Proper nutrition  especially during the first three years  is crucial for a child's mental and physical development.Your baby's doctor may order blood, urine, or other tests and monitor your baby's caloric intake for a period of time. She may also watch you nurse or bottle-feed to see whether your baby's jaw is working correctly or whether he's having trouble sucking. Sometimes the answer is very simple, and sometimes it's quite complicated.The doctor may refer your baby to a pediatric gastroenterologist, a dietitian, or a feeding specialist for evaluation and treatment.This can be a worrisome and frustrating time. It can be difficult to hear that your baby isn't thriving, but it's important that you don't blame yourself or feel like you're not a good or nurturing parent. What could be causing my baby's failure to gain weight?There are so many potential causes that a doctor could spend months performing tests and studying a baby's diet, health history, activity level, and possible causes of stress before discovering the source of the problem.In general, if your baby isn't growing steadily, it means that she's either not eating well or not absorbing or using nutrients properly. Here are some reasons this might happen:Feeding problems:Your baby may be repeatedly getting tired and falling asleep before he gets enough milk.She may have a weak sucking reflex that leaves her unable to get enough milk from your breasts if you're nursing  or even from a bottle, although this occurs more commonly with breastfeeding.A cleft lip or palate would interfere with breastfeeding. These conditions are addressed with special bottles and nipples and the help of feeding specialists. (A cleft lip and palate are usually repaired over the course of a baby's first year.)Being tongue-tied could make it difficult for your baby to nurse well and get all the nourishment she needs. It can also affect bottle feeding, though that's less common.If you're feeding your baby formula, preparing the formula incorrectly can lead to failure to gain weight.If you're nursing and you've had trouble getting a breastfeeding routine going, your baby may not be getting enough to eat. It's possible that your breasts are not producing enough milk to sustain your baby or that your hindmilk isn't letting down.A third of your breast milk is known as foremilk, which is readily available for your baby. When you start to nurse, your body instinctively releases the hormone oxytocin, which stimulates the flow of the rest of your milk, the hindmilk. This is known as the letdown reflex, and you'll know it's happened if your nipples feel tingly or your breast milk spurts. Hindmilk has more calories than foremilk.If you're stressed out or in pain, the letdown reflex can fail to kick in, preventing your baby from getting hindmilk. When this is a chronic problem, it can result in failure to gain weight. To encourage the letdown reflex, try to find a relaxing place to nurse.Some babies who are fed on a strict schedule rather than on demand (whenever they indicate that they're hungry) can get less nutrition than they need. Most experts believe that it's best to let your baby nurse or bottle-feed for as long as he wants when he wants.Growth CalculatorSee how your baby compares to others in height, weight, and head size.Other common causes:If your baby has been ill, his body may need more calories and nutrients. An illness may also hurt your baby's appetite.He may have chronic gastrointestinal problems such as diarrhea, reflux, celiac disease, or a milk intolerance.If you have postpartum depression or several other young children vying for your attention, you may be unable to give your baby the attention he needs to be sure he's getting enough calories.In rare cases, failure to gain weight can turn out to be a result of a lung problem, such as cystic fibrosis; a nervous system problem, such as cerebral palsy; a chromosome problem, such as Down syndrome; heart disease; anemia; or a metabolic or an endocrine disorder, such as growth hormone deficiency. If any of these is the cause, it's important to catch it early. How does a doctor treat failure to gain weight?Once you and your doctor figure out what's causing the problem, you can both set about correcting it by treating any medical issues and increasing your baby's caloric intake, if necessary.Getting your baby back up to a healthy weight may mean supplementing breastfeeding with formula or, for a baby who has started on solids, offering more high-calorie foods. Once she's old enough for them, good choices include whole milk products such as cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, and pudding (but hold off on offering cows' milk until age 1), eggs, avocados, whole-wheat breads and pastas, pancakes, mashed potatoes, and hot cereals.In severe cases, a baby with failure to gain weight may need to be hospitalized so that she can receive intravenous feedings and be monitored closely.I'm new to nursing. How can I tell whether my baby is getting enough to eat?If your baby's younger than 3 months old and you're breastfeeding him exclusively, you'll know he's getting enough milk if:He wets six to eight cloth diapers, or five to six disposable diapers a day.He has several mustard-colored bowel movements a day for the first month. After the first month, he may have bowel movements less frequently or even skip a day or two in between.When he's nursing, you can see him moving his jaw and hear him sucking. You may even hear him swallowing, if the room is quiet.Your breasts feel softer after a feeding than they did before.He's gaining about an ounce each day for his first three months. (After that, doctors look for a gain of about 0.5 to 0.6 ounces a day until 6 months, 0.4 ounces a day for babies between 6 and 9 months, and 0.3 to 0.4 ounces a day for babies from 9 to 12 months.For other suggestions, read more about how to tell if your baby's getting enough milk.If your baby tends to get sleepy during feedings, keep him alert during feedings. You can try:gently tickling his feetundressing himchanging his diaper before or in the midst of a feedingengaging him in some quiet playsitting him upright to burp him when you're switching from one breast to the otherIf he doesn't finish nursing on both sides, empty your breasts by pumping so you can keep your milk production up.If you're concerned about your baby's weight or food consumption between regularly scheduled checkups, ask to bring your baby to the office to be weighed once a week. For accuracy, make sure you always use the same scale. You can also get a scale to use at home. Medela rents accurate baby scales for home use. Call (800) 435-8316 (option 3) for information.While breastfeeding doesn't always turn out to be the best option for all moms and babies, don't assume that you should switch to formula because you're having some problems. Ask your doctor for advice and perhaps a referral to a lactation consultant.There are things you can do to increase your milk supply, for example, and tips that may help you help your baby nurse more efficiently. You may well be able to resolve the issues without giving up breastfeeding before you intend to.Does failure to gain weight mean that my child will always be smaller than he should be?That depends on the underlying cause of her poor weight gain. If your baby has a long-term medical condition, for example, it's possible that she may always be smaller than average. On the other hand, if the problem is easily reversed, she may catch up by growing faster than usual for a period of time.Show sources Hide sources AHRQ. 2003.

Gagging in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_gagging-in-babies_9197.bc,"Why does my baby gag?There are lots of possible explanations. We all have a gag reflex  it's a lifelong automatic response that helps prevent choking.Until your baby's about 4 to 6 months old, he also has a reflex that causes him to thrust his tongue forward whenever the back of his throat is stimulated. This tongue-thrust reflex can make early feedings a bit of a challenge. Gagging on or pushing out those first spoonfuls of cereal isn't uncommon.Prodding your baby to eat more than he wants can cause him to gag, as can having too much food (or food he doesn't like) in his mouth, even after the tongue-thrust reflex is gone.Some babies will even gag on their own fingers until they figure out how far they can put things in their mouths. And until they get the rhythm of sucking down, some infants will gag on breast milk or formula, especially if it's flowing too quickly for them.Gagging is a normal reflex babies have as they learn to eat solids, whether they are spoon-fed or you're doing baby-led weaning. Gagging brings food forward into your baby's mouth so he can chew it some more first or try to swallow a smaller amount. Your baby should gag less often as he develops and learns to regulate the amount of food he swallows.Baby-led weaning: Is gagging normal?

See what normal gagging looks like and find tips to prevent choking. See all videosHow can I tell if my baby is gagging or choking?Gagging is different from choking.Choking means your child's airway is partially or completely blocked, which prevents breathing. Here's how to recognize the difference between gagging and choking:A child who is gagging may push his tongue forward or out of his mouth and do a retching movement to try to bring food forward. His eyes may water. He may cough or even vomit. Let your child continue to gag and cough because that's the most effective way to resolve the problem.A child who is choking is unable to cry, cough, or gasp. He may make odd noises or no sound at all while opening his mouth. You may need to do back blows or chest thrusts to dislodge the blockage.What can I do to minimize gagging?Try to get your baby to relax during feedings and don't push him to eat more than he's inclined to. If he's bottle-fed, make sure the hole in the nipple is the right size. If it's too large, too much milk or formula may come at him at once.Also make sure he's ready for solids before you introduce them. He should be at least 4 to 6 months old and able to sit upright with support.When you think your baby's ready, start by putting a small amount of food on a spoon. Tip the spoon and place a bit of the food on the front of his tongue, rather than putting the whole spoonful in his mouth. This way, your baby can suck the rest of the food off the spoon without feeling it at the back of his throat right away.If your baby pushes the food out with his tongue, it doesn't necessarily mean that he doesn't like it  he's probably just trying to figure out this new way of eating. Feed him slowly while he gets the hang of it.After a few tries, he should start using his tongue to move the food to the back of his mouth. If your baby is still having trouble swallowing the food after a week, he's probably just not ready for solids yet.Once your baby's ready for table food, keep an eye on him so that he doesn't choke while feeding himself. Cut his food up into bite-size pieces no larger than 1/2 inch and avoid foods that are choking hazards, such as whole grapes, nuts, and popcorn.Most likely your baby will gag less as he gets more meals under his belt. If he continues to gag on pureed foods, mention it to his doctor. She can check for physical problems, just to be sure.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015. Choking prevention.

Worry watch: Phthalates,https://www.babycenter.com/0_worry-watch-phthalates_10353854.bc,"What are phthalates?Phthalates (pronounced ""thah-lates"") are among the most commonly used chemicals in the world. They're a type of plasticizer, used to soften plastics in products like toys, household items, cars, bottles, and food containers. They're also used in personal care products, including baby products, to help lotions penetrate and soften the skin and make fragrances last longer.How do phthalates get into the body?Plasticizers are all around us. Children are particularly vulnerable to them because they tend to put things in their mouth and play on the floor and because their nervous and reproductive systems are still developing.Here's how we're exposed:When a baby sucks on an object that contains plasticizers (like a teether, squeeze toy, or bath book) or a young child handles it and then sucks his fingers, the chemicals can end up in the child's body.We also ingest plasticizers by eating food or drinking beverages that come in plastic packaging that leaches the chemical into the food or liquid.The phthalates in deodorants, nail polish, hair spray, perfumes, lotions, creams, and powders (including baby products) can be absorbed through the skin and into the bloodstream.We can breathe in phthalates from dust or fumes from any products that contain vinyl, such as flooring, window blinds, seating (in cars, for example), and some diaper-changing pads.In addition, phthalates can cross the placenta, so they can be passed to a baby during pregnancy. And they can be transmitted through breast milk.Are phthalates dangerous?The question is being debated. The evidence available so far is based on animal studies, and no extensive, conclusive human study has been conducted.The animal studies suggest that exposure to phthalates may lead to low birth weight, low sperm production, and abnormal male genitalia.Human studies are looking at the relationship between phthalates and asthma. There are also studies examining whether phthalates influence the timing of puberty and the risk for childhood obesity, disruptive behavior, and autism.How are phthalates regulated?In 2008, the U.S. government banned toys and childcare items (such as teethers, pacifiers, and rattles) that contain more than 0.1 percent of certain phthalates.The Food and Drug Administration requires cosmetic products to list ingredients on the label. But individual fragrance ingredients don't have to be listed. So if a product contains ""fragrance"" as an ingredient, it may contain phthalates without specifying them. Also, cosmetic products sold to professionals don't have to declare ingredients on their label.European governments have restricted the use of phthalates in some baby products, cosmetics, and plastics designed to come into contact with food.What can I do to protect my family?Here are some steps you can take to limit your family's exposure to phthalates:Limit the amount of baby care products you use on your baby, especially if he's 8 months or younger.When you do use baby care products, choose products that are labeled phthalate-free or fragrance-free.Use glass and stainless steel instead of plastic when you can for water bottles and storage containers.When you buy plastic containers or bottles, look for products that are labeled phthalate-free.Check the bottom of plastic bottles for the recycling number and choose those labeled 1, 2, 4, or 5, which are generally considered safer. Avoid those labeled 3, 6, or 7.Discard plastic items like bottles and cups when theyre worn or scratched.Don't microwave food or drink in plastic containers or under plastic wrap. (High temperatures cause the chemicals to leach out of the plastic.)Choose alternatives to canned foods, like fresh fruits and vegetables and those in glass containers. Bisphenol A (BPA), another plasticizer, may be leached from the lining of canned goods. It has been found in liquid infant formulas, so if you can, breastfeed or use powdered formula instead.When you buy food such as cheese or meat wrapped in plastic, slice or scrape off a thin layer before serving.Don't give your child polymer clays to play with. There are plenty of recipes for making your own modeling clay.When painting or using other solvents, be sure the space is well ventilated  and that your child is elsewhere. Look for natural paints without DBP (dibutyl phthalate).Don't buy products made from vinyl or PVC (polyvinyl chloride), especially when those products will wind up in your baby's mouth in the form of teethers, pacifiers, or toys. Instead, choose items made from natural products when possible. When you do buy plastics, look for those made of polyethylene or polypropylene plastics rather than vinyl or PVC.Choose non-vinyl shower curtains, raincoats, lawn furniture, and building materials whenever possible.Wet mop your floors and wipe down surfaces frequently.Avoid air fresheners. Most air fresheners (even if labeled ""fragrance free"") contain phthalates. Open the windows or use a natural air refresher instead."
Cow's milk: A powerful ally,https://www.babycenter.com/0_cows-milk-a-powerful-ally_10372093.bc,"Why do experts recommend that children drink cow's milk?Milk is a rich source of calcium, which builds strong bones and teeth and helps regulate blood clotting and muscle control. And it's one of the few sources of vitamin D, which helps the body absorb calcium and is crucial for bone growth. Almost all milk in the U.S. is fortified with vitamin D. (Ultraviolet rays are another source, but they're blocked by sunscreen.)Milk also provides protein for growth, as well as carbohydrates, which will give your child the energy he needs. And if your child gets enough calcium from the get-go, there's evidence that he'll have a lower risk of high blood pressure, stroke, colon cancer, and hip fractures later in life.How much milk should my child drink?According to the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP), most kids will get enough calcium and vitamin D if they drink 16 to 20 ounces (2 to 2 1/2 cups) of cow's milk a day. (Most 1-year-olds should have whole milk. Low-fat or fat-free milk is fine for children 2 and older.)Don't offer more than 3 cups of milk a day or your child may not have room for the other foods she needs to round out his diet. If your child's still thirsty, offer water.My child doesn't like cow's milk. Any tricks I can try?Meeting the minimum requirement of 2 cups can be a challenge if your child doesn't care for milk. But there are many ways to get milk into your child's diet: Add it to his cereal. Serve yogurt, cottage cheese, pudding, custard, or shakes for snacks. Make soup with milk rather than water. Add a milk-based sauce or gravy to casseroles.What if my child doesn't like any dairy products? Or if she's allergic or we're vegans?If your child isn't getting enough calcium and vitamin D from milk and other dairy products, perhaps because she can't tolerate them or your family is vegan, your pediatrician will probably recommend calcium and vitamin D supplements.Should I buy organic or hormone-free milk for my child?There's no conclusive evidence that these kinds of milk are better for children, but there's no harm in them. (Organic milk does tend to be more expensive.) Read up on growth hormones in milk and organic foods to help you make a decision.The AAP warns against giving your child ""raw"" or unpasteurized milk, though. Without pasteurization, milk may contain harmful bacteria or parasites that can cause serious illness or even death.Could my child have a milk allergy?True allergies to cow's milk are relatively uncommon. Only 2 to 3 percent of children are allergic to milk, according to the AAP, and almost all of them outgrow it by age 3. (Learn the difference between a milk allergy and lactose intolerance.)If your child drank cow's-milk-based formula as a baby without any problems, you can rest assured that she'll have no problems tolerating regular cow's milk. Even babies who were exclusively breastfed for the first year can usually handle regular cow's milk because they've been exposed to cow's milk protein in their mother's milk (unless their mother avoided all dairy).If your child drank soy formula because your doctor recommended it, though, check with your doctor before starting her on cow's milk. Your doctor may recommend that you start with a soy beverage that's been fortified with vitamin D and calcium. (See what our experts say about giving soy milk or rice milk to a child who won't drink cow's milk.)The main symptoms of milk allergy are blood in the stool, diarrhea, and vomiting. If your child also develops eczema, hives, a rash around the mouth and chin, chronic nasal stuffiness, a runny nose, cough, wheezing, or breathing difficulties, it could be a sign that the respiratory system is being affected by a milk allergy. If your toddler develops any of these symptoms, talk with her doctor.If your child appears to have sudden and severe problems with breathing or swallowing, take her to the nearest emergency room. She may be having a life-threatening allergic reaction.If it turns out that your toddler is allergic to cow's milk, you'll want to be careful to avoid foods such as cottage cheese, condensed or evaporated milk, ice cream, yogurt, margarine that contains milk, butter, milk chocolate, and powdered milk. Thanks to a law passed in 2004, all allergens must be clearly marked on food products  in this case, the label will say ""milk."""

But I told myself that if for some reason it didn't work out, I wouldn't get too stressed about it. I'm adopted so I wasn't breastfed. I mainly decided to breastfeed because of the cost of formula. It's way too expensive!My son was in the NICU for over a week because he had a blood infection at birth (which was very scary!), so I started pumping right away on a two-hour cycle. It wasn't till day four or five that I actually nursed him.We had a little trouble at first because Logan had some nipple confusionhe didn't know how to treat the breast differently from a pacifier, which he'd been given in the NICU. I had to use a nipple shield to help him latch on, which was kind of annoying, but it wasn't a lot of trouble. And because I'd been pumping and producing milk already, I didn't have any worries about making enough milk.6 things you'll need for breastfeeding Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:27Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:27Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Learn which items can bring relief to cracked nipples, leaking breasts, and other nursing challenges. See all videosStill, I didn't really find breastfeeding a bonding experience  it was just something that I did. I nursed Logan until he was about 6 months old, when one day he pretty much just stopped wanting the breast. But he'd still take the bottle, so I just pumped and fed him breast milk in bottles.I continued to pump until he was 13 months old. I had a good breast pump, a hospital-grade one. I never had any problems with pumping  it was easy and second nature to me. Sometimes I used the time to relax, almost sleeping while I was pumping. I watched a lot of TV while pumping  it was definitely a time to chill out.It did become a bit of a pain in the butt toward the end, especially when I started working. But my work was really good about it. No one had a problem with it. We just started referring to it as ""doing my thing."" Everyone knew what it meant. When the corporate apartment we lease out was empty, I used that space. When it wasn't, I used a chair in the bathroom.I never had any issues with letdown  to this day, I couldn't tell you what the milk letting down feels like. I didn't have any physical sensation of it, like other moms do. It was just really easy.But by 13 months, I was so ready to be done with it. I increased the hours between my pumping sessions, starting with eliminating the middle-of-the-night pump. I just extended the times in between throughout the day. And then I was done. No pain, no infections.My biggest lesson learnedIf you're planning to go back to work, you should pump from the beginning. Learning to do it early helps you get used to it and gives you time to build up a supply of frozen breast milk. I don't think the majority of moms-to-be really think about pumping  it's usually about whether to breastfeed or go with formula. But many women work and need to pump, so it's worth thinking about.Back to all breastfeeding essays"

My breastfeeding story: Exhausting but worth it,https://www.babycenter.com/0_my-breastfeeding-story-exhausting-but-worth-it_10419214.bc,"Name: AshleyLives in: Tucker, GeorgiaBreastfeeding experience: Unprepared for how exhausting and complicated breastfeeding can beMain challenges: Finding a good nursing rhythm, keeping up a reliable milk supply, fitting many pumping sessions into a single workdayBreastfed for: 14 months and countingMy storyBefore my daughter was born, I decided to breastfeed to save money. It was as simple as that. Then I took a lactation course and watched latching videos on YouTube and learned about the skin-to-skin bonding that comes from breastfeeding. The more research I did, the more into it I got.By the time Harper was born, I felt ready  but she wasn't. She had trouble latching onto my breast at first. She fussed. Our skin-to-skin bonding didn't last as long as I wanted it to. But we hung in there and she found a way to nurse.For the first month Harper nursed every one to three hours. I found it exhausting, partly because I had a hard time establishing a rhythm. She'd nurse for maybe five minutes and then cry, breaking her hold on my breast, and I'd have to put her back on the same breast to finish.Also, her poop was green when it should have been mustard colored and I got stressed out thinking she wasn't getting the nutrients she needed.I did more research and decided to try block feeding so she'd get the fattier milk she seemed to need. This meant limiting her to only one breast for three hour blocks of time, which seemed to work for her.(Editor's note: Block feeding is typically recommended only if a mother has an oversupply of milk and a baby is gaining weight too quickly, fussy and gassy, or has reflux symptoms. Mothers who block feed require monitoring because milk production slows when a baby is limited to only one breast for three hour blocks of time.)When I returned to my job as a health scientist, I organized my work schedule so I could pump three times a day, which is pretty demanding. Still, when Harper was seven or eight months old my milk supply started falling off. So I increased my pumping to four or five times a day, including getting up an hour before she woke.At 10 months I saw another dip and almost moved to formula. But I decided to give it one last try instead. I added yet another pumping session to my day, and my milk came back.Before having Harper, my biggest worry about breastfeeding had been developing thrush, which makes nipples sore. Everyone said it was so painful! I didn't get thrush, but I developed a bacterial infection when Harper was about 13 months old, which made nursing very uncomfortable. I took antibiotics and after a month it cleared up.Now, I'm sort of done breastfeeding. I'm tired of going out with Harper and having her reach for my shirt. I'm also just tired. I'm weaning her slowly and don't offer her the breast anymore. But she's still reaching for it, even if sometimes she just nurses for two minutes. I'm trying to go with the flow but it's exhausting.Breastfeeding has certainly been harder than I expected. But I'm so into the whole idea of it that I'm going back to school to get certified as a lactation consultant! I just got accepted into a program and will take my courses online. I know I'll be tired because I'm working and I'm a mom, but I'm also very excited. Whatever a woman's goal is with breastfeeding, I want to be there to help her be successful.My biggest lesson learnedKeep your eyes on the prize, which in my case meant giving my daughter the full benefit of breastfeeding. While I never had any major problems, I went through some tough times trying to keep Harper fed. What kept me going was my commitment to feeding her without using formula.Back to all breastfeeding essays"
Parents Say: Making the medicine go down,https://www.babycenter.com/0_parents-say-making-the-medicine-go-down_11961.bc,"Short of a spoonful of sugar, how can you get your little one to take her medicine? Try these tips from BabyCenter parents.Keep in mind that there are some medicines that should not be taken with certain foods  or with any food at all. It's very important that you ask your baby's doctor or your pharmacist before combining  or following up  your baby's medication with a favorite treat. (And of course the tips on mixing medicines with food and juice only apply once your baby is eating solids.)Try a new toolWe bought this wonderful pacifier that has a little measuring cup attached to hold the medicine. You put the medicine in, give the pacifier to the baby, and as he sucks, down goes the medicine! No mess, no fuss. He doesn't taste the medicine because most of it slips past his taste buds. I don't know what we would have done without it! LindaI've found that an oral syringe is best. It accurately measures and completely administers even the thickest medicines with ease. Just distract your baby a little, aim for the inside of the cheek, and he's dosed before he knows what hit him. AnonymousAn alternative to yet another gadget is the bottle nipple. It works best when timed right before feedings for a hungry baby. Pour the measured medication into the nipple and let baby begin to feed. When the medicine is gone, screw the nipple onto the bottle and continue feeding. R.N. and mother of threeAdd a little somethingThe nurses recommended mixing the medicine with a couple of ounces of formula or juice in a medicine pacifier. This worked for us. You don't want to mix medicine with a full bottle in case the baby doesn't finish it. Ask the doctor first to make sure the medicine doesn't need to be taken on an empty stomach and that there are no possible interactions with the juice. Lois, OhioI tried asking for the flavors that a pharmacist can add to liquid medicine, and they worked great with my youngest daughter. I get everything in her favorite flavor, watermelon, and everything goes down just the way it's supposed to. AnonymousWhen I need to give concentrated drops to an infant, I try to thin the medicine by mixing it with a teaspoon or two of water. It helps with my baby, since it's not too thick or too strong tasting. D3I have finally found the only way for my 2-year-old to take a liquid antibiotic, but it only works for the refrigerated chalky kinds. I have tried hiding it in every product known to man, and he could always tell and refused to eat or drink for a week for fear I was poisoning him. Finally, I discovered the V8 Splash smoothies in the juice aisle. They are very strong (yet delicious) and naturally thick like the medicine, so he has no idea it's in there. WendyMy son wouldn't take his medicine because it was very chalky and yucky tasting (even to me), so I mixed it with a teaspoon of yogurt. I called the pharmacist first, and he said it was okay to do with that specific prescription. Goes down easy now! Anonymous Adjust your techniqueBelieve it or not, I follow what the veterinarian told me to do with my cats and dogs. I put the syringe to the inside of the mouth, squirt in a small amount at a time, and rub the underside of the cheek right below the ear, at the jawbone. It works every time! Debbie, mother of StaceyWe found that if we used the dropper and dispensed the medicine in the cheek as recommended, our daughter would spit it out. If we let her taste it, though, she would pretty much suck it out of the dropper, with no waste, like it was a pacifier. JenWhenever possible we give our son his medicine when he's in the tub. That way, if he does happen to spit it out or throw it up, he's a lot easier to clean up. KimberlyThe best way to get my daughter to swallow the medicine is to use a syringe to give her a small amount of it and then immediately put the pacifier in her mouth. Her reflex is to suck the pacifier and she'lll swallow the medicine. I repeat this a few times for larger amounts. AnonymousI always nurse right after administering any medication. Infant suspensions are often bitter, despite the flavoring. Nursing right afterward helps to wash the taste out of his mouth, plus it's comforting to him. JeanAlternating between giving my baby small amounts of the medicine with an oral syringe and formula from a bottle works great. The bottle gives my baby comfort and distraction and before she knows it, she's had a squirt of medicine and is sucking on the bottle again. It usually takes only a couple of switches back and forth to get all the medicine down. I think you could use this method if you're breastfeeding, too. TrinaTry another formIf your child won't take a particular medicine, ask her doctor for an alternative preparation, such as a suppository or a more or less concentrated dose. Mollie, California"
Diarrhea in babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_diarrhea-in-babies_82.bc,"How can I tell if my baby has diarrhea?First, you'll need to consider what's normal for your particular baby. Newborn babies poop frequently  as often as after every feeding  and their poop is typically pretty soft, especially if the baby is breastfed.On top of that, your baby's stool may change depending on what you've eaten, if he's nursing. Once he starts eating solid foods, you'll find that his stool has firmed up a bit  though it may change from time to time, depending on his diet.All of which makes it hard to describe how to tell if your baby has diarrhea. Here's one way to think about it: An occasional stool that's looser than normal for your baby is nothing to worry about, but if your baby' bowel movements suddenlychange  that is, he poops more than usual and passes looser, more watery stools than usual  then it's probably diarrhea.While a severe case of diarrhea can alarm even the most unflappable parents, most cases of diarrhea in the United States are relatively mild and don't pose a major health threat as long as your baby doesn't getdehydrated. But dehydration can be very serious, even fatal, in a baby, so it's crucial that you make sure your baby is getting plenty of liquids. My worst diaper-changing momentA circus of bodily fluids, a nighttime explosion, and more diaper-changing disasters. Hear parents' tales of their worst encounter with a dirty diaper.What causes diarrhea?The list of possibilities is long. Your baby's diarrhea could be caused by a viral or bacterial infection. It might also be the result of a parasite, a course of antibiotics, or something he ate.Viral infectionAny number of viruses  like the rotovirus, adenovirus, calicivirus, astrovirus, and influenza  can cause diarrhea, as well as vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, chills, and achiness.Bacterial infectionBacteria  such as salmonella, shigella, staphylococcus, campylobacter, or E. coli  can also be responsible for diarrhea. If your baby has a bacterial infection, he may have severe diarrhea, accompanied by cramps, blood in his stool, and a fever. (He may or may not be vomiting.)Some bacterial infections clear up on their own, but some, like that from the E. coli that can be found in undercooked meat and other food sources, can be very serious. So if your baby has these symptoms, take him to the doctor. She'll examine him and probably evaluate a stool culture for signs of a bacterial infection.Ear infectionIn some cases, an ear infection (which may be viral or bacterial) can be the culprit in a bout of diarrhea. If this is the case, you may also notice that your baby is fussy and pulling on his ears. He may also be vomiting and have a poor appetite, and he may have recently had a cold.ParasitesParasitic infections can also cause diarrhea. Giardiasis, for example, is caused by a microscopic parasite that lives in the bowel. Symptoms may include gas, bloating, diarrhea, and greasy stools.These kinds of infections are easily spread in group-care situations, and treatment involves special medicine, so your baby will need to see the doctor.AntibioticsIf your baby has diarrhea during or after a course of antibiotics, it may be related to the medicine, which kills off good bacteria in the intestines along with the problem-causing bacteria. Talk to his doctor about alternatives and remedies, but don't stop giving any prescribed medication to your baby until his doctor gives you the go-ahead.Too much juiceToo much juice (especiallyfruit juicecontaining sorbitol and high levels of fructose) or too many sweetened drinks can upset a baby's tummy and cause him to have loose stools. Cutting back the amount should solve the problem in a week or so.The American Academy of Pediatrics(AAP) recommends that you not give your baby fruit juice before the age of 6 months. After that, give him no more than 4 ounces a day.Improperly mixed formula can also cause diarrhea, so make sure you're adding the right amount of water when you mix your baby's formula.Food allergyCall 911 if your baby is having trouble breathing or has swelling of his face or lips.Afood allergy(in which the body's immune system responds to normally harmless food proteins) can cause mild or severe reactions  immediately or within a couple of hours. Symptoms might include diarrhea, gas, abdominal pain, and blood in the stool. In more severe cases, an allergy can also cause hives, a rash, swelling, and breathing difficulty.Milk protein is the most common food allergen. (Your baby shouldn't drink cow's milk until after his first birthday, but formula made with cow's milk or food made with a dairy product  once he's eating solids  can cause a reaction, if your baby's allergic. In some cases, so can breast milk, if the mother has been eating dairy products.)Other common food allergens (most of which your baby won't yet have on his menu) include eggs, peanuts, soy, wheat, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish. If you think your baby might have a food allergy, talk with his doctor.Food intoleranceUnlike a food allergy, a food intolerance (sometimes called a food sensitivity) is an abnormal reaction that does not involve the immune system. One example of a food sensitivity islactose intolerance.Lactose intolerance is very unusual in babies, but if your baby is lactose intolerant, it means his body isn't producing enough lactase, the enzyme necessary to digest lactose, the sugar in cow's milk and other dairy products. When the undigested lactose stays in the intestine, it can cause symptoms such as diarrhea, abdominal cramping, bloating, and gas. Symptoms usually start half an hour to two hours after consuming milk products.By the way, if your baby has a severe case of diarrhea, he may temporarily have trouble producing lactase, and as a result he might have symptoms of lactose intolerance for a week or two.PoisoningIf your baby has diarrhea and is vomiting and you think he may have swallowed some kind of nonfood item like a medication, chemical, or plant, call the Poison Control Center right away (800-222-1222). Call 911 if he becomes unconscious or is having trouble breathing. Other symptoms may include fatigue and convulsions. How should I treat my baby's diarrhea?Keep your baby hydrated. Although rarely serious when treated properly, diarrhea can send your baby to the hospital if he becomes dehydrated, so your first concern should be giving him enough liquids. If your baby isn't also vomiting, continue to give him breast milk or formula.If your baby can't keep breast milk or formula down, call his doctor, who may suggest that you start giving him a pediatric electrolyte solution. These solutions are available in drugstores and come in flavors that most babies will readily drink if they're dehydrated. They're generally easier to keep down than breast milk or formula, too.Stay away from sugar. Avoid sweetened fluids like sodas (including ginger ale), athletic drinks (like Gatorade), sugar water, and undiluted fruit juices. Also avoid Jell-O. All of these contain sugar that draws water into the intestine and makes the diarrhea worse.Give an older baby well-balanced meals. Doctors now advise continuing to feedsolidsto a baby with diarrhea who's already made the transition to finger or table food. While there's nothing wrong with feeding your baby the classic BRAT diet of bananas, rice, applesauce, and dry toast, the AAP says a normal diet that includes such staples as complex carbohydrates (like breads, cereals, and rice), lean meats, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables is safe to eat. A standard, healthy diet may shorten your baby's bout of diarrhea because it restores essential nutrients needed to fight infection.If your baby temporarily refuses to eat, don't worry. As long as he stays hydrated his appetite should return in a day or two.Feed your baby yogurt. Studies have shown that live bacterial cultures, found in yogurt, are a safe and effective way to cut down on the amount and duration of diarrhea. If your baby's already eating solids, plain, unsweetened, whole-milk yogurt is an easy way to treat the problem, especially if your baby loves the taste of it. Just be sure to buy yogurt that contains lactobacillus, or live cultures.Change diapers regularly. Keep your baby dry. Use care and tenderness  and diaper cream  at changing time, since it's easy for a baby's bottom to become red and irritated from the loose stools.Cuddle. If your baby's uncomfortable during a bout of diarrhea, comfort him as much as possible.Is it okay to give my baby an adult anti-diarrheal medication?No, don't give your baby any anti-diarrhea medicine unless his doctor prescribes it. These medicines can be dangerous for babies and children.When should I call the doctor about my baby's diarrhea?Call the doctor immediately if your baby is 3 months old or younger and he has diarrhea. If he's over 3 months, call the doctor if your baby has diarrhea and doesn't seem to be improving after 24 hours. Also call if your baby has diarrhea and any of the following symptoms:Vomiting multiple timesSigns ofdehydration such as dry mouth, not having had a wet diaper for six hours or more, and crying without tearsBlood in his stool or black stoolA high fever  101 degrees Fahrenheit (38.3 degrees Celsius) or higher if he's 3 to 6 months old; 103 degrees F (39.4 degrees C) or higher if he's 6 months or older. (If your baby is less than 3 months old and his temperature reaches 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit  38 degrees Celsius  or higher, call the doctor immediately; a baby this young needs to be checked for serious infection or disease.)How can I keep my baby from getting infectious diarrhea?Frequent hand washing is your best defense, because the microorganisms that cause diarrhea are easily passed from hand to mouth. Handling a soiled diaper, for instance, can transfer these microorganisms to your hands before you wipe your baby's mouth. Your baby can also catch a diarrhea-causing infection from putting his fingers in his mouth after touching toys or other objects that have been contaminated with the stool of an infected child.Wash your hands thoroughly for at least 15 seconds with soap and warm water after handling soiled diapers or using the bathroom and before preparing food. Wash your baby's hands often, too. Also, be sure to follow safe food preparation and cooking practices.Learn more:Dehydration in babiesVomiting and stomach problems in babiesBaby poop 101A visual guide to baby poopShow sources Hide sources AAP.

Food allergies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_food-allergies_12409.bc,"Could my child have a food allergy?It's possible, although a suspected food allergy often turns out to be something else.A child who has a tummy ache or diarrhea after eating something, for example, probably is not allergic to it but is just having trouble digesting the food.By understanding how allergies work, you may be able to recognize the early signs, just in case. It's also important to know what to do if your child ever has an allergic reaction.Experts estimate that food allergies affect 4 to 8 percent of children. And the numbers have been climbing  by as much as 50 percent in the last decade, according to some estimates. According to a 2013 study by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the prevalence of food allergies in children under 18 years old rose from 3.4 percent in 1997-1999 to 5.1 percent in 2009-2011.What happens if my child has an allergic reaction to a food?When kids are allergic to a food, their body treats the food like an invader and launches an immune-system attack.Sometimes the body makes an antibody called IgE, a protein that can detect the food. If your child eats the food again, the antibody tells your child's immune system to release substances such as histamine to fight the ""invader."" These substances cause allergy symptoms, which can be mild or severe.Symptoms usually show up within minutes to two hours after eating a specific food. Your child may complain that her tongue or mouth is tingling, itching or burning, or just say that her mouth feels funny. Her ears may itch, or she may develop hives or have trouble breathing.If your child has a severe allergic reaction, it can be life threatening.In some cases, though, food allergy symptoms  such as eczema or gastrointestinal problems like vomiting or diarrhea  are chronic, or ongoing. (Eczema is dry, scaly patches of skin that show up on a child's face, arms, trunk, or legs.)Children can have a reaction to a food even if they've eaten it before without any problem. So a child who inherits the tendency to be allergic to eggs might not have a reaction the first few times he eats them  but eventually the symptoms will show up.Keep in mind that your child's early exposures to the ingredient may have been when it was combined with something else  for instance, the eggs, milk, or ground nuts in a cookie.Then there's a specific type of food allergy that mostly affects babies. It's called food protein-induced enterocolitis syndrome (FPIES), and it results in gastrointestinal reactions, such as profuse vomiting and diarrhea, and dehydration. It's uncommon, but it can be very serious.The severe symptoms of FPIES generally show up about two to three hours after the baby eats the food, though sometimes infants who are ingesting the food regularly (in breast milk or formula, for example) develop increasingly severe symptoms.Cow's milk or soy (in formula), and proteins in breast milk are the most common triggers of FPIES in the first months of life. Once a baby starts eating solid food, rice and oats are the most common culprits, though any food protein can be responsible.FPIES can be difficult to diagnose (there's no standard allergy test for it). Most babies with FPIES recover from it in early childhood.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.What foods might my child be allergic to?It's possible to be allergic to any food, but these eight food groups are responsible for 90 percent of food allergies: eggs, milk, peanuts, wheat, soy, tree nuts (like walnuts, Brazil nuts, and cashews), fish (such as tuna, salmon, and cod), and shellfish (like lobster, shrimp, and crab).What should I do if I think my child's having an allergic reaction to food?If your child ever seems to be having trouble breathing, has swelling of the face or lips, or develops severe vomiting or diarrhea after eating, call 911 or your local emergency number right away.Severe allergic reactions are nothing to fool around with. Your child's airway can close up within minutes, so don't call the doctor to get advice or drive your child to the emergency room. You need paramedics on the scene as soon as possible.If your child consistently has symptoms within two hours of eating a certain food, talk with his doctor. You may be referred to a pediatric allergist for testing. An allergist should be able to tell you which food or foods are causing the problem and whether the symptoms are part of an immune reaction (indicating an allergy) or are a sign that your child's unable to digest the food (indicating a food intolerance).Once your child has had an allergic reaction to a food, you'll want to be prepared in case it happens again. Even if the first reaction was mild, the next one might be severe. Your child's doctor can provide you with an action plan, including instructions on how to manage an allergic reaction.The doctor may recommend that you carry an epinephrine auto-injector, which delivers an emergency shot of epinephrine. The doctor can prescribe one and show you how to use in case of a reaction. These devices automatically administer the right dose of epinephrine to stop an allergic reaction.In some cases  if she's very responsible and local laws allow it  an older child can carry the epinephrine injector herself. Talk with your child's doctor about whether this is recommended for your child.It's a good idea to have your child wear medical identification jewelry, to identify the allergy. Make sure anyone who takes care of your child  babysitters, relatives, daycare workers, teachers  knows about the allergy and which foods are off-limits.Point out the kinds of foods that could hide the substance and ask caregivers to double-check ingredients. Also make sure caregivers know exactly what to do if your child does have an allergic reaction.Are allergies inherited?Your child may inherit the tendency to have allergies but not necessarily a specific allergy.For example, if you have hay fever, pet allergies, or a food allergy, your child has a 50 percent chance of having some sort of allergy, too, although maybe not the same one you have. That probability jumps to 75 percent when both parents have allergies.A food allergy can start at any age. A child with a food allergy is two to four times more likely to have other allergies and related conditions, such as dermatitis and asthma, than kids who don't have allergies.Do kids outgrow food allergies?Many outgrow allergies to milk, egg, soy and wheat during childhood.Allergies to peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish are more likely to be lifelong than other food allergies.What's a food intolerance and how is it different from a food allergy?Adverse reactions to food are reported by about 20 percent of the U.S. population, but most of those reactions aren't allergic in nature. The most common type of adverse food reaction is a food intolerance.A food intolerance doesn't involve the immune system. If your child has a food intolerance, it may mean he has trouble digesting a particular food. You may notice that every time he eats or drinks that food, he's plagued with digestive symptoms such as gas, bloating, or diarrhea.The most common one is lactose intolerance. People who are lactose intolerant lack the enzyme necessary to digest the sugar in cow's milk and other dairy products.What should I do if I think my child might have a food allergy?Talk with her doctor. The doctor might suggest a food diary to help identify the cause or, if your child is still an infant and bottle-fed, a change in infant formula  and might refer you to an allergist or pediatric gastroenterologist.An allergist will ask detailed questions about your child's symptoms. An allergy skin test or a blood test might be done to determine whether the symptoms are caused by an immune reaction.If the skin test produces a hive or the blood test shows that your child has IgE antibodies to the food, there's a chance she's allergic to that specific food. If the tests are negative, your child's symptoms are less likely to be due to a food allergy, although they may be caused by a food intolerance.At that point, you may be referred to a gastroenterologist to pinpoint the cause of the intolerance or to investigate other explanations for your child's symptoms.Is there anything I can do to prevent or delay a food allergy?This is the million-dollar question. In the past, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) suggested delaying the introduction of certain foods in children who seemed likely to have allergies because their parents had allergies. But practices in other cultures  and recent research  suggest that might not be the best course of action.The AAP now says there's no solid evidence that waiting to introduce allergenic foods protects children from developing an allergy. In fact, delaying the introduction of allergenic foods may actually raise the risk of food allergies. If you think your child is likely to have a food allergy, talk with his doctor about the best strategy.Experts are now suggesting you introduce new foods, including potential allergens, starting at 4 to 6 months of age, after some other typical foods have been started (such as fruits and vegetables and cereals). Introduce the new foods, including the potential allergens, one at a time, so if your child has a reaction you'll know what he's reacting to.Don't give your child cow's milk until he's 12 months old, but other dairy products are fine.Breastfeeding may offer some protection against allergies. Consider breastfeeding your baby as long as you can, especially if you have a family history of allergies.Can food allergies be treated?There are a number of promising approaches under study, and better treatments are likely to be available in the next few years, says Scott Sicherer, professor of pediatrics, allergy and immunology at Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York City.At this time, however, there are no medications that cure or prevent allergic reactions to foods, and the allergy shots used for hay fever don't work for food allergies. The key to preventing an allergic reaction is strict avoidance of the food.Avoiding a particular food is trickier than it sounds. Foods show up in unlikely places, and even a little bit may be enough to trigger a severe reaction. Most people who have a severe reaction have eaten a food they thought was safe.You'll have to become vigilant about reading food labels, knowing which ingredients to avoid, and asking about ingredients in restaurant dishes or food at friends' homes.Food manufacturers are required by law to list these top food allergens on product labels: eggs, milk, wheat, soy, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and crustacean shellfish (crab, shrimp, and lobster but not mollusks like clams, oysters, or squid). Nuts, fish, and shellfish must be named specifically.All the allergens must be listed in plain language. For example, the label has to say ""egg"" instead of ""albumin"" or ""egg"" in parentheses after ""albumin."" If you're unsure about a product's ingredients, call the manufacturer.If your child is avoiding many foods, talk with his doctor about seeing a dietitian, to make sure the nutrients in his diet are adequate.The proteins that cause the allergy can be passed on in your breast milk. So you may need to give up the offending food yourself if you're nursing a baby with a food allergy.And if you're formula-feeding a baby who seems to be allergic to cow's milk, you may need to change formulas. Some babies who are allergic to cow's milk are also allergic to soy, though, so it's important to discuss the situation with your child's doctor before making any kind of change.If your child has been diagnosed with a food allergy, you'll want to learn all you can about it  including exactly which foods to avoid, how to read labels, and how to recognize the early signs of an allergic reaction.Show sources Hide sources AAAAI.

Engorged breasts,https://www.babycenter.com/0_engorged-breasts_231.bc,"How can I tell if my breasts are engorged?Between the second and fifth day after giving birth, it's normal for your breasts to become larger, heavier, and a little sore as they begin producing greater quantities of milk. Some of the fullness is due to extra blood and lymph fluids in the breast tissue. This fullness usually eases within the first two to three weeks after delivery and your breasts should feel softer, even when your milk supply is plentiful.But if your breasts feel hard, swollen, throbbing, lumpy, uncomfortably full, or painful, you are likely engorged. The swelling may extend all the way to your armpit and you may even run a low fever.Engorgement can make it difficult for your baby to breastfeed effectively. A hard areola makes it challenging for your baby to latch ondeeply, which can lead to painful nipples and a low milk supply. Engorgement can also lead to serious health concerns, so call your doctor or lactation consultant if your breasts are hard and painful, if you have a fever higher than 100.4 Fahrenheit, or if your baby has problems breastfeeding.What causes engorgement?You may become engorged if you're not able to nurse your baby frequently or thoroughly enough to empty your breasts in the first few days after birth. This is important even though you may only be producing a small volume of milk right after delivery. (Learn more about how to start breastfeeding.) But some women become engorged no matter how well and often their baby breastfeeds.Breastfeeding Problem SolverFind solutions to a variety of breastfeeding challenges, including nipple pain, low milk supply, and more.You may also become engorged if your milk ducts are obstructed. This can happen if you've had breast augmentation and the implants take up so much room that there's not enough space left inside the breast for the increased blood, lymph, and milk. Ducts can also become obstructed if you regularly wear a bra that's too tight. (If you suspect your bra is too tight, read our tips to find the right bra size.)How can I prevent engorgement?Not every postpartum mom experiences engorgement. Some women's breasts become only slightly full, but others find their breasts grow astonishingly big and hard. Here are some things you can do to reduce your chances of becoming engorged:Breastfeed within two hours after birth if possible. (Your labor and delivery team should be able to help you with this.)Nurse frequently  between eight and 12 times a day after the first 24 hours. (You should offer the breast frequently during the first day as well, but the baby may not nurse eight times.) Look for your baby's hunger cues. Keeping your baby snuggled with her skin against your skin helps encourage her to breastfeed. Wake your baby if more than three hours go by from the start of one feeding session to the start of the next.Let your baby finish nursing on one breast before switching to other. This will typically take between ten and 20 minutes. (If your baby won't nurse for at least ten minutes, ask a lactation consultant whether you should pump until your baby nurses longer.) Your baby may not nurse on the other side. If she doesn't, just start on that breast next time.Avoid introducing a bottle or pacifier in the first month unless there is a medical reason to do so. The muscles used to suck on a bottle or pacifier are different than those used to breastfeed and your baby may have a hard time nursing after she's learned how to get milk from a bottle. Read our article on ""nipple confusion"" (or ""nipple preference"") to learn how it can affect your baby and how you can avoid it.If your doctor or lactation consultant has advised you to supplement with a bottle, use pumped milk instead of formula. If you do supplement with formula, make sure you hand express or pump each time the formula is given.If a feeding is skipped or your baby doesn't nurse well, hand express or use a breast pump to get the milk out.How can I treat engorgement?The good news is that taking steps to ease the pressure will help relieve engorgement more quickly. Here's how you can make breastfeeding more comfortable and ease engorgement:Just before nursing, place a warm compress on your breasts for a few minutes to get the milk flowing. You could also take a quick warm shower. Don't apply heat for more than three minutes, since too much warmth can increase swelling and make it harder for the milk to come out. If you're engorged to the point that milk isn't coming out, don't use warm compresses.Nursefrequently, with no more than two to three hours between feedings. If your breasts are uncomfortably full and your baby is sleeping, try hand expressing a little milk for relief. (It may be easier to manually express milk in the shower.) Many women find that it is uncomfortable or painful to express milk. This is an unfortunate side effect of the milk ducts being overly full, but your breasts are likely to be less tender once some of the milk is out.While your baby is nursing, gently massage the breast he's on. This encourages the milk to flow and will help relieve some of the tightness and discomfort.While your baby is having a hard time latching on, hand express some milk. Orpumpfirst, then hand express until your areola is compressible. (Unlike pumping, hand expression softens the areola, which makes it pliable enough for your baby to latch on.)If you're breastfeeding at least every two to three hours and it's going well, avoid pumping milk except when you need to soften the breast. And only pump on a low setting for a few minutes  so you're not putting in an extra ""order"" to make more milk. Excessive or habitual pumping can lead tooverproduction of milkand prolonged engorgement.To soothe the pain and help relieve swelling, apply cold packs to your breasts for about ten minutes before or after nursing. You can use crushed ice in a plastic bag or a bag of frozen peas or corn, covered with a thin cloth.Many women find a supportive nursing bra to be helpful. You may even want to wear one at night. Be sure it fits well and has no underwire. Underwire can cause constriction and clogged ducts.Consider taking ibuprofen or acetaminophen to relieve discomfort or pain. These are usually safe drugs to take while nursing.Look ahead: You'll get past this engorgement and soon be able to enjoy your breastfeeding relationship with your baby.If you have flu-like symptoms or a fever that climbs to 101 degrees F or higher, call your doctor. You may have a breast infection.How long does engorgement last?Fortunately, engorgement passes pretty quickly for most women. You can expect it to ease up in 24 to 48 hours if you're nursing well or pumping at least every two to three hours. If not treated, engorgement can take up to ten days to start to go away.Once the engorgement passes, your breasts will be softer, although still full of milk. If you'renot nursing, it will probably get worse before it gets better. Even if you're not breastfeeding, you may need to pump to relieve the pressure on your breasts and minimize your risk for breast infections. Discuss techniques to reduce this risk with your doctor or midwife.Can I still nurse?Yes, you can and should nurse. Unrelieved engorgement can cause a low milk supply, plugged ducts, mastitis, or a serious breast abscess, so it's important to nurse frequently from the very beginning.If possible, breastfeed your baby in the first hour or two after he's born, and nurse often from that point on. Watch your baby for signs of hunger, such as sucking his fist and becoming restless. Don't put a newborn on a feeding schedule or wait until he's crying in hunger.Will engorgement affect my baby?Engorgement can make it harder for a baby to latch on. Talk to your baby's doctor if you're concerned she's not getting enough milk.Learn moreFind out how and when to use a breast pumpLearn how to express milk by handReview the basics with our visual guide to breastfeedingGet tips from breastfeeding veteransLearn about lactation consultants and how to find oneFind answers fast with our Breastfeeding Problem SolverShow sources Hide sources Arora S, et al. 2008.

Sample baby schedules for 3- and 4-month-olds,https://www.babycenter.com/0_sample-baby-schedules-for-3-and-4-month-olds_3657230.bc,"Getting into a routine with your baby is a personal thing. You'll learn to read your baby's cues to develop a pattern of eating, sleeping, and playing that meets your little one's needs and works for your family.That said, it can be a big help to see what other moms and dads are doing. We asked parents of 3- and 4-month-olds to share their baby's daily schedule, then picked the eight below as a helpful representation.As you're creating a schedule for your baby, keep in mind that at 3 and 4 months most babies need:6 or 7 ounces of breast milk or formula per feeding, though limit this amount to 32 ounces in a 24-hour period. (Get specific tips on how to tell whether your baby is getting enough breast milk or formula.)Some parents start solid foods like infant cereal when their baby is 4 months old. (The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breastfeeding exclusively for at least the first 6 months, though that doesn't always work for parents.)About 15 hours of sleep in a 24-hour period  this includes nighttime sleep and naps. Three naps during the day (morning, afternoon, and evening) is typical. Read more about sleep needs at this age.Time for playing, developing important muscles, working on new skills, and interacting with you. Try reading to your little one, giving your baby a massage or bath, or going for a stroller walk.Baby sleep: Tips for 3 to 9 months Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:05Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:05Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

I hold him for a while and try to feed him a bottle. He usually has about an ounce. He won't eat for the first two hours that he's up. (I guess he won't be a breakfast kid!)I get ready for work and play with him at the same time. We look in the mirror and laugh. He does some tummy time. I usually have CNN on so he looks at that on occasion  I turn him away from the TV, though, or he stares at it.6:30 a.m.: We leave for daycare. He smiles all the way there (this baby does not cry). We have a mirror in the backseat near his car seat so he laughs at himself. Once there, I hand him over. (Sad.) Throughout the day he eats, does tummy time, takes naps, plays with other babies, and so on. They have no TV there, so he doesn't watch television. He just plays and naps all day.4:30 p.m.: I typically pick him up by 4:30. (I get to work early so I can get home early.) He is usually smiling. We go home.4:30 to 5:30 p.m.: He wants to eat, then we play  he likes singing and patty-cake. He sits in his activity saucer, does tummy time  whatever he seems to be in the mood for.5:30 to 6:30 p.m.: Bath time! His favorite part of the day! My husband usually gets home around this time. After his bath, we play some more. I just try to spend a lot of time with him.6:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.: We usually read to him, talk to him. Usually he gets hungry again. He eats a lot between 4:30 and 7:30 at night.7:30 p.m. to 8 p.m.: He usually falls asleep by 8 p.m. He likes to chew on his toys until he drifts off.11 p.m.: He wakes up to eat.

Break his routine by too much and watch out  all hell can break loose!6:30 a.m.: Mommy gets home from her night shift at the police department and quietly gets into bed next to her dear husband. (Our son just started sleeping in his own room this week, so I don't have to be as quiet.)8 to 8:30 a.m.: Baby wakes with big grins for a very tired Mommy, making it very worthwhile for her to get up after only sleeping one and a half hours!9 a.m: Diaper change, 8-ounce bottle.9:30 to 10:30 a.m.: Playtime either in Mommy's lap or the bouncy seat.10:30 a.m.: Swing goes into Mommy's bedroom, baby goes into it, and Mommy and baby sleep until 12:30 or 1 p.m.1 p.m.: Baby wakes up a happy little man, gets a diaper change and an 8-ounce bottle.1:30 to 3 p.m.: Playtime in his activity saucer and tummy time and back time on his play mat.3 p.m.: Nap time for Mommy and baby.4 p.m.: Mommy gets up to get ready for work.

My husband is really good about watching our son so I can get a little extra sleep on my nights off. Our son is such a pleasure, though, that it's hard for me to sleep knowing he's awake and having fun with Daddy in the next room! I want to play, too.Schedule 4: A breastfeeding stay-at-home mom of a 4-month-old and a toddlerEditor's note: This schedule is a combination (parent-led and baby-led) routine7 a.m.: Wake up, nurse, get dressed.

We're in bed by 10 p.m.12 a.m.: Wake, nurse, right back to bed.4 a.m.: Wake, nurse, right back to bed.6:30 a.m.: Start all over again.Schedule 6: A breastfeeding stay-at-home mom of a 3-month-oldEditor's note: This schedule is a combination (parent-led and baby-led) routineAddie and I have fallen into a natural routine. She nurses every two and a half hours or so during the day and will sleep through the night without waking up to be fed.5 a.m.: Addie wakes up. I lift her into bed with me where I nurse her in a side-lying position. She usually falls back asleep beside me, but if I get up then she will too.8:30 a.m.: Nurse Addie again in the nursery and wash her face with a warm washrag, put on lotion, take off pj's, sing some songs, and have tummy time. I lay her in the crib in the nursery while I get dressed and beautified. This is Addie's most talkative part of the day  she babbles a lot.10 a.m.: I carry Addie around with me while I pick up the house. She's usually ready to eat again by 10:30, so we take some time out to breastfeed and listen to the radio.11:30 a.m.: Addie is getting sleepy  time for a mid-day nap in her swing. I eat lunch and do a load of laundry. Or I take her out and she sleeps in her car seat while we run errands in town. It's much easier to grocery shop while she sleeps.Between 12:30 and 1 p.m.: She wakes up hungry and nurses again. We usually read a book or two after this feeding, then have playtime if she's up for it.2:30 p.m.: She eats again, then goes into the front carrier for a while.4:30 p.m.: She eats again. Addie takes a nap, but no sleeping past 6 p.m. or she won't sleep at night! Usually I vacuum the house because the hum of the vacuum always puts her to sleep. Then I lay out clothes for bedtime and get things ready for the bath (towels, tub, lotion, and hairbrush).6 p.m.: My husband and I eat dinner. It's a team effort  one cooks and the other cleans. Usually I cook while he holds Addie, then he washes dishes while I give Addie a bath.Between 6:30 and 7 p.m.: She has half a feeding (on only one breast) then bath time for 30 minutes. We give her a quick massage with lotion, put her pj's on, and brush her hair. She nurses on the other breast at about 8 p.m. My husband dims the lights and turns the television down.8:30 p.m.: The whole family begins to wind down and relax. We read a book with Addie.9 p.m.: My husband rocks Addie in the rocking chair and sings along to mellow music.10 p.m.: She nurses again for the last time. After she nurses on one breast, we change her diaper and swaddle her. Then, while I'm nursing her on the other breast, my husband turns on the vacuum in the other room. I lay her in the bassinet beside our bed, and she falls asleep by about 10:30. I crawl into bed shortly thereafter, and we begin the whole routine again at 5 a.m. the next day. Schedule 7: A formula-feeding working mom of a 3-month-oldEditor's note: This schedule is a combination (parent-led and baby-led) routineLandon usually gets up between 5:30 and 7 a.m. and has a 5-ounce bottle. He plays in his bouncy seat while I get ready for work.I run a day care, so Landon is in the nursery there, just down the hall from my office  a perfect setup. He generally drinks 5 ounces every three to four hours. He takes two naps while we're at work. The afternoon nap is anywhere from two to three hours long.We get home between 5 and 6 p.m., and I feed him a bottle. Then he has playtime and tummy time on the floor. He'll usually take a cat nap around 7, then will get up for some time with Mommy and Daddy. Around 9 p.m., Landon gets a bath and then his bedtime bottle of 5 ounces. We rock and cuddle until he goes to sleep. He generally sleeps through the night but occasionally gets hungry in the middle of the night and will wake for a bottle and then go right back to sleep. He's an excellent baby, and my husband and I both know how blessed we are.Schedule 8: A formula-feeding stay-at-home mom of a 3-month-oldEditor's note: This schedule is a baby-led routineOur 3-month-old is in a great routine (I prefer that word to ""schedule""). He wakes each morning at 6:30 a.m. and has a 6-ounce bottle. He's awake for about an hour and a half and then takes a 45-minute nap. He has another 6 ounces at 9:15 a.m., then we play for about an hour. He goes down for a nap in his crib around 10:30 a.m. and sleeps until noon or so.He has another 6-ounce bottle at noon or 12:15 p.m. Then we get out of the house for a little while to do errands, visit friends or family, and so on. He will usually sleep for about 30 to 45 minutes in his car seat. At 3 p.m. he has another 6-ounce bottle. Then it's playtime for an hour or so and down for a nap in his crib at around 4:30 p.m.He usually sleeps until 6 p.m. I've been concerned that this is a late long nap compared to other babies, but it's when he's tired and it works for us. After waking up, he plays with us until about 7:45 p.m., then gets a bath, has a 4- or 5-ounce bottle, and sleeps until morning!Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

First 24 hours at home with your baby,https://www.babycenter.com/newborn-baby,"You've probably heard that all a newborn baby does is eat, poop, cry, and sleep. Sounds simple, right? It may become simple, but chances are it won't seem that way at first. Knowing what to expect from your newborn will make your first days home together a little less overwhelmingvide.To help map out what's in store after the big homecoming, we turned to pediatricians and mothers Laura Jana and Jennifer Shu, who literally wrote the book on the topic. The third edition of their bookHeading Home With Your Newborn: From Birth to Realitywas released in May 2015 by theAmerican Academy of Pediatrics.What to expect: Newborn feedingBecause their stomachs are so tiny, newborns need to eat small amounts  about 1 to 3 ounces  frequently. Some want to nurse or have a bottle every two to three hours, while others will be hungry even more often.While some babies announce their hunger with strong cries, others will give more subtle cues such as sucking on their hands, smacking their lips, or rooting, which is when a baby purses her lips and turns her head toward the breast or bottle.How to swaddle a baby Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:54Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:54Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all baby videosIn their first few days, newborns typically lose about 7 percent of their body weight. While this is normal, you'll want to feed your baby every two hours or so until she's back at her birth weight.Newborns are sleepy, so you may need to wake your baby up to feed and give her gentle encouragement to stay awake while eating. Try undressing your baby down to the diaper, rubbing her head or back, or talking to her. The goal is for your baby to be back to her birth weight at her 2-week checkup.What to expect: Newborn burps, hiccups, and spit-upsSome newborns need to be burped frequently, while others burp on their own and need very little assistance from you. If your baby is fussy or uncomfortable during or after a feeding, that's a cue to burp her.You can also try burping your baby when you switch breasts, after every 2 or 3 ounces, every 10 to 15 minutes of feeding, or when your baby's finished eating. After a day or two of feedings, you'll find a pattern that works for your little one.No need to bang your baby's back like a bongo  a gentle circular motion or soft pats will bring up the bubbles. There are several burping positions to try, including holding your baby with her head resting on your shoulder, sitting her upright on your lap with the fingers of one hand supporting her chest and chin, or laying your baby tummy-down across your lap.Don't be alarmed by hiccups or spit-up. Hiccups are normal for new babies and don't cause them discomfort. Likewise, spitting up during and after feedings  in small amounts or what may seem like the entire feeding  is pretty normal.If your baby's spitting-up seems excessive or is accompanied by her arching her back or crying, read more about the difference between reflux, which is normal and improves with your baby's head control, and gastroesophageal reflux disease, or GERD, which requires treatment. Whatever's causing it, if your baby's a spitter-upper, you'll want to keep a burp cloth handy.What to expect: Newborn pee and poopA breastfed newborn will have at least five wet diapers a day. A formula-fed baby may have even more than that  up to ten per day.There's a large range for what's a ""normal"" number of bowel movements, too. Breastfed babies tend to poop more than formula-fed ones, since formula takes a bit longer to digest. But breastfed babies vary widely, going as seldom as once every four or more days to as often as once per feeding. Formula-fed babies typically poop a few times a day, but it can range from one poop every other day to several poops per day.You'll want to keep track of your baby's pee and poop schedule, as the doctor may ask about her urine and bowel movements at the first checkup.The very first bowel movements  usually occurring during the first day or two, often when you're still at the hospital  are called meconium. These first poops have a black, almost tar-like consistency. The ones that follow won't look much like grown-up poop, either. Be prepared for greenish, light brown, or seedy, mustard-yellow poops from a breastfed baby. A formula-fed baby's poop tends to be pastier and vary in color. Call the doc if your baby's stool contains whitish mucus or streaks or flecks of red, which can indicate a problem. (Red is a sign of blood in the stool.)Normal poop consistency also ranges from very soft to watery, with breastfed babies having looser poop. This can easily be confused with diarrhea. Basically you want to keep an eye out for a change from your baby's usual pattern or consistency  which is admittedly hard when your baby is first creating a pattern. When in doubt, check with your doctor.""If you're confused, just remember this,"" says Jennifer Shu. ""Whether we're talking about pooping, eating, sleeping, or crying, every baby is different. Normal is actually a big range. What matters most are sudden changes  and that's when you should contact your doctor.""See our complete baby poop slideshow for a visual guide to what you might find in your baby's diaper. What to expect: Newborn cryingThere's no getting around this one: Your newborn will cry. How often, how hard, and how long is entirely variable and will change over time, says Laura Jana.For the first few days, many newborns are remarkably quiet and sleepy. But by two weeks old, a typical newborn will cry about two hours a day. (Crying usually increases until about six to eight weeks of age, then starts to taper off.)Over time, it'll get easier to figure out why your baby's crying. At this point, run through the most likely culprits  soiled diaper, hungry, overtired, uncomfortable  and you'll probably find the source. If not, another reason for early fussiness can be overstimulation. Some infants get fussy when they're amidst too much commotion or activity.There will be times, however, when your baby cries with no clear cause, and you'll need to figure out what soothes your baby. Remember: There's no such thing as spoiling a newborn, so respond to her cries with attention and affection.If being unable to always quickly or accurately figure out why your baby is crying makes you feel helpless, frustrated, or incompetent, try to be less critical of yourself. ""Every new mother has been there, even the 'experts',"" says Shu. ""There will be times when your baby's needs are obvious, but there will also be times when you're just not sure about anything!""What to expect: Newborn sleepYour newborn's tiny tummy will likely keep her from dozing more than a few hours at a time before she wakes up to eat. All the short naps will add up, though  your newborn will sleep about 16 to 18 hours total each day. You may want to track when and where your baby sleeps, to identify patterns and answer any questions from your baby's doctor.Luckily, newborns have the amazing ability to fall asleep pretty much anywhere  in the car seat, baby carrier, bassinet, or in your arms. Many newborns prefer the snug fit of a car seat or baby carrier to their crib for sleeping, because the close confines remind them of your womb.That's why so many new babies love being swaddled, too. Being snugly wrapped up mimics the environment your baby is used to and keeps a reflexive jerk of an arm or leg from waking her up.No matter when or where your baby sleeps, always put her on her back and remove all loose blankets, as well as bumpers, pillows, quilts, and toys to reduce the risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS). Also, never leave a snoozing baby unattended on a couch or bed as the risk of rolling or falling is always present, even if your baby can't roll on her own yet.Once your baby is asleep, don't be surprised if you hear her making strange noises. If it sounds like your baby has a cold, it's probably because babies are natural nose breathers. Since she can't clear her nasal passages by herself yet, you can use a bulb syringe to clear them for her, which may make it easier for her to breathe and sleep  and even eat.What to expect: Newborn breathingAnother newborn habit is periodic breathing. Your baby may breathe quickly, pause for a few seconds, then start breathing again. Although normal, it can be unnerving.However, the following signs aren't normal and warrant an immediate call to your baby's doctor:GruntingFlaring of the nostrilsChest retractions (sucking in the skin above the collarbone, between the ribs, or below the ribs)Breathing that's consistently fastWheezing from her chest (rather than her nose or throat, which is a sign of garden-variety congestion and stuffiness)Heavy, noisy breathing (audible wheezes, whistling sounds, or crackly sounds during inhalation and exhalation)Pausing more than 10 to 15 seconds between breathsSee more signs you should call the doctor for your newborn. What to expect: Newborn bathingKeeping your baby clean in the first couple of days is pretty basic. For now, you won't need the baby bathtub. While your baby's umbilical cord stump is still hanging on, it should not be immersed in water. Sponge baths are enough to keep a newborn clean for the first week or two. In fact, too much bathing could dry out your baby's skin.Use a warm, damp washcloth or unscented wipes to gently wipe around neck folds and other areas where breast milk, formula, or moisture might accumulate, finishing with the genitals. If you notice any redness or irritation in the diaper area, a swipe of diaper cream or petroleum jelly should squelch it.Don't be surprised if your newborn's skin doesn't look like the perfect baby skin in the commercials  that will come later. Many newborns have a range of minor skin irritations, such as newborn rash, cradle cap, peeling, or general dryness after emerging from their nine-month bath in amniotic fluid. You may even spot some shoulder and back hair  it usually falls out within a week or two.Read more about baby body care.What you really need: Newborn clothesCute outfits will probably take a back seat to ease and comfort at first  after all, you want clothes that are easy to change, and that work well for your baby's many naps. Many parents use some combination of T-shirts, one-piece bodysuits, and footed pajamas, plus a swaddling blanket or a sleep sack in cold weather or at night.If your newborn dislikes having clothes pulled over her head or her umbilical cord stump is sensitive, kimono-style one-piece outfits that snap at the sides can come in handy. For warmth, most hospitals send newborns home with a hat, but unless it's quite chilly, a cap is optional.Use your common sense as well as your own internal thermostat to gauge how many layers to put on your baby. Many people adhere to the age-old ""what you're wearing plus one layer"" rule. When in doubt, add a light blanket or hat  you can always remove it if your baby feels warm.Read more about dressing your infant in the first six weeks.What you really need: Newborn gearDuring your pregnancy, you may have amassed a small mountain of baby gear. For now, you won't use much of it. You need a safe place for your baby to sleep and of course you'll need a properly installed car seat for the ride home. Extras such as bouncy seats, activity mats, toys, and other baby gear will come in handy eventually, but don't worry about them this week. Your newborn's needs right now are both all-consuming and surprisingly simple.Check out our handy list of mom and baby gear for the first six weeks to see what's most useful when you bring your baby home. What to expect: Your transition homeBringing home a baby is a life-altering change, and you shouldn't expect to adapt to it the moment you walk through the door. In fact, it may take anywhere from a few days to a few months to get your bearings. While you're navigating this huge adjustment, remember to cut yourself some slack and let go of your ideas about how things ""should"" be.Your body is dealing with fluctuating hormone levels, healing from giving birth, and is seriously sleep-deprived. Your mind is adjusting to this new stage of life. You may laugh, cry, be frustrated, get excited, and feel a myriad of emotions within mere hours  or minutes. And you'll probably find that caring for a newborn  simple as those needs are  takes up an astonishing amount of time, making it hard to fit in even the basics for yourself.About 70 to 80 percent of new mothers experience the ""baby blues"" during the hormonal roller coaster that is the first few weeks after delivery. Luckily, the baby blues are short-lived, generally fading within two weeks. All moms should be aware of them, though, and of the signs of postpartum depression (PPD).Compared to the baby blues, PPD lasts longer and is more severe. PPD affects 1 in 10 women. Getting treatment is important for both you and your baby, so if you have symptoms of PPD, talk to your partner or someone close to you for support and discuss your symptoms with your doctor.One way to combat the baby blues is to carve out tiny bits of time to tend to yourself, and enlist family, friends, or hired help to handle chores and errands. Don't be shy about asking your friends and family to help stock the fridge, bring meals, or run a load of laundry.While your baby sleeps, use the time to take a nap, grab a shower, or just spend a few minutes looking at a magazine or zoning out. Anything you can do to recharge your batteries between feeding, burping, changing, and cuddling will help.What to expect: Your bodyYour body is also going through major physical changes. About 72 hours after giving birth, your milk will come in. Often, this coincides with your first day at home. Until now you've been producing the coveted, antibody-rich colostrum, which is usually yellower than breast milk.You'll know when the real deal comes in because your breasts become noticeably fuller, firmer, and heavier. This is when engorgement can happen.While many people assume breastfeeding comes naturally, it's not uncommon to hit some bumps in the road  especially early on. ""Even if you were coached by a lactation consultant or nurse at the hospital, you may need more help after you head home,"" says board-certified lactation consultant and childbirth educator Sabrina Easterling.A lactation consultant or support group can be invaluable for troubleshooting problems and getting adequate assistance in these first few days. With help, you'll start to learn the finer points  from getting the perfect latch to finding your favorite hold.Breastfeeding can make your nipples really sore. Try different positions to prevent aching and cracking. Washing your breasts with water, applying pure lanolin cream after breastfeeding (the cream does not need to be removed before feeding), using drops of expressed breast milk as a nipple moisturizer, or even icing your breasts can help.6 things you'll need for breastfeeding Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:27Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:27Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Learn which items can bring relief to cracked nipples, leaking breasts, and other nursing challenges. See all videosIf you're not sure whether your baby's hungry, pay attention to whether she actually swallows when you offer her your breast. If she's self-soothing rather than nursing, try offering her own thumb for comfort to give your nipples a rest.If you've decided not to breastfeed, get advice from your doctor or a lactation consultant about the best way to suppress lactation. ""Once you ramp up production, many women are surprised to find that it can be tough to shut it down without discomfort,"" Easterling says.While you stop lactating, you'll experience engorgement pain. The discomfort should peak about three to five days after giving birth and then taper off. To deal with the temporary pain, try over-the-counter pain relievers, ice packs, and a supportive bra. A decongestant can also help speed up the process, as it dries out body tissues.If you had a vaginal delivery, you'll probably be quite sore. If you had a tear or an episiotomy, it may be extra painful. Apply a cloth-covered ice pack to the area to reduce swelling. Some women swear by witch hazel pads for reducing inflammation, too.When you go to the bathroom, use a squirt water bottle instead of wiping, which can be painful. Many women experience severe constipation after delivery, and stool softeners can help. Also, for about six weeks after delivery you'll probably need to wear a full-size sanitary napkin to absorb the flow of blood called lochia, which ranges in color from red to yellow to white.A c-section is major abdominal surgery, and if you had one, you'll need someone to help you with almost everything for at least a week  from basic household tasks to picking up your baby for feeding and diaper changes. In fact, many doctors advise their patients not to pick up anything heavier than the baby until they get the doctor's all-clear at the first postpartum check-up.You'll probably leave the hospital with some form of pain medication, and it's a good idea to track what medicine you take and when. Been-there-done-that moms concur: Take what you need, and don't feel the need to be brave and go without.Call your doctor if you notice blood or pus seeping from the incision, as that could indicate infection or a blood clot. As with those who've had a vaginal delivery, you'll want to avoid straining on the toilet, and you may need to take a stool softener for at least the first bowel movement or two.One of the most shocking things about your post-baby body might be the one thing that didn't change: You may still look pregnant. If so, don't fret, it typically takes weeks  or months  for your body (especially your belly) to fully recover. In the meantime, it's perfectly normal to keep wearing maternity clothes after giving birth.Read more about recovering from childbirth.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Baby-led weaning: An alternative approach to starting your baby on solids,https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-led-weaning-an-alternative-approach-to-starting-your-ba_10419206.bc,"What is baby-led weaning?Baby-led weaning (BLW) is an alternative method for starting your baby on solids. Instead of spoon-feeding him mushy cereals and purees, you put large chunks of soft food directly on the highchair tray or table, and let your baby grasp the food and feed himself. It's called ""baby-led"" because you let your baby pick up the food and eat at his own pace, instead of controlling how much and how quickly he eats.This technique first gained popularity when public health nurse Gill Rapley coined the term ""baby-led weaning"" in the United Kingdom about a decade ago. (There, weaning means starting your baby on solid food. It has nothing to do with stopping breastfeeding, as it does in the United States.)Just as with traditional spoon-feeding, your baby will continue to get most of his nutrition from breast milk or formula until he gets used to eating solid food (usually around his first birthday).Check out our videos to see how it's done:Baby-led weaning: Signs your baby is readyBaby-led weaning: Getting startedBaby-led weaning: 9 great finger foodsBaby-led weaning: Is gagging normal?What are the advantages of baby-led weaning?Proponents say BLW has numerous benefits, including:Healthy eating: BLW may produce healthier eaters than spoon-feeding because babies get to choose how much to eat. Learning to regulate their food intake may help prevent obesity. And allowing babies to explore different food flavors and textures may make them more adventurous eaters, meaning they're more likely to try new foods and eat a broad range of foods as they grow up.Skill development: By trying to grasp and eat chunks of food, infants practice eye-hand coordination. BLW allows older babies to practice picking up small pieces of food using their index finger and thumb, using a fine motor skill known as the ""pincer grip."" They also may learn how to feed themselves and chew and swallow more quickly than spoon-fed babies.Less stress for parents: BLW can be less time-consuming if you're making your own baby food because you don't have the extra step of pureeing the food, and you don't have to sit and spoon-feed your baby. It also makes it easier for babies to participate in family mealtimes because they can eat many of the same foods as the rest of the family.More enjoyable for babies: When babies get to select which piece of food they want to eat from a variety in front of them, and eat it at their own pace, they may enjoy eating more than if they are spoon-fed by an adult.Is there evidence to support these claims?Very few scientific studies have been done on BLW so far, but existing research suggests BLW may help prevent obesity and encourage babies' participation in family mealtimes.For example, one small study in the United Kingdom found that children who started solids using BLW tended to have a lower body mass index (BMI) than spoon-fed kids. Spoon-fed children had a greater chance of being overweight and were more likely to favor sweet food.Another small study done in New Zealand found babies introduced to solid foods using BLW were more likely than spoon-fed babies to share mealtimes with their families, which may help kids develop healthy eating habits. The BLW babies also tended to eat food the rest of the family ate, while spoon-fed babies were more likely to eat commercially prepared baby food. Eating the same food as other family members may encourage healthier long-term eating patterns, the authors said.Are there downsides to baby-led weaning?Potentially, yes. Researchers note BLW could result in nutritional deficiencies for some babies. For example, the BLW babies in the United Kingdom study mentioned above were more likely than spoon-fed babies to be significantly underweight.This could be because BLW babies may not ingest much food in the first weeks or months. (And it may be more of a problem for babies whose manual dexterity is developing more slowly than average.) Parents also tend to offer mostly fruits and vegetables, which are easy to grasp but don't contain many calories.BLW babies may also end up deficient in iron, especially if they don't drink formula, because they don't get the iron-fortified cereal that most spoon-fed babies are given.One small study suggested that parents using BLW who offer at least one iron-rich food (such as beef, chicken, or hummus) at each meal could increase their baby's iron intake.Another small study raised other nutritional questions. It found BLW infants ate more fat and saturated fat, and less iron, zinc, and vitamin b12 than spoon-fed babies. The authors concluded that if families decide to follow BLW, they should make sure they give infants healthy, nutrient-rich foods.Can baby-led weaning increase my baby's risk of choking?One big concern about giving babies whole food to eat is whether 6-month-old babies are developmentally ready to chew and swallow chunks of food and whether these chunks  even when they're soft  are choking hazards.The American Academy of Pediatricians (AAP) doesn't have an official opinion on BLW. But the organization warns that choking is a leading cause of death among young children and recommends serving babies only mashed, pureed, or ground-up food when they're first starting solids.According to the AAP, your baby is ready for finger foods once she can sit up and bring her hands or other objects to her mouth. To avoid choking, the AAP says you should make sure any food you give your baby is soft, easy to swallow, and cut into small pieces. This is unlike BLW, in which babies are given large chunks of food.A recent study compared a modified version of BLW (designed to reduce choking risk) to traditional spoon-feeding, and the results showed BLW is no more likely to cause choking than traditional spoon-feeding. In this study, 206 moms were randomly assigned to either the modified baby-led weaning technique or spoon-feeding group.Although neither feeding approach demonstrated a greater choking risk, 35 percent of infants in both groups choked on food at least once during the study. The authors believe this shows that all parents need to watch their children carefully at mealtimes and know what to do if they start to choke.What about gagging?Whether they're being spoon-fed or trying BLW, many babies gag when they first start solids, and this can be disconcerting or even frightening.Experts say gagging is a normal reflex babies have as they learn to eat solids. Gagging brings food forward into your baby's mouth so he can chew it some more first or try to swallow a smaller amount. Your baby should gag less often as he develops and learns to regulate the amount of food he swallows.If your baby gags a lot, try to remember it's a temporary stage that your baby will get through.How can you tell if your baby is choking? Choking means your child's airway is partially or completely blocked, which prevents breathing. Here's how to recognize the difference between gagging and choking:A child who is gagging may push his tongue forward or out of his mouth and do a retching movement to try to bring food forward. His eyes may water. He may cough or even vomit. Let your child continue to cough because that's the most effective way to resolve the problem.

See what normal gagging looks like and find tips to prevent choking. See all videosA child who is choking is unable to cry, cough, or gasp. He may make odd noises or no sound at all while opening his mouth. You may need to do back blows or chest thrusts to dislodge the blockage.When can I start baby-led weaning?Most babies are ready to start BLW when they're about 6 months old, though some may need more time.It's likely that your baby is ready to start BLW if she can sit up without support and shows signs of readiness, such as being interested in your food (or even reaching for it), grabbing and putting objects in her mouth, and making chewing motions while watching you eat.Keep in mind that BLW may not be right for babies with special needs or who are unable to pick up and chew food on their own. Talk with your baby's doctor before trying BLW, especially if:Your baby has special needs and can't chew very well.Your baby has difficulty picking up food and moving it to her mouth.Your baby was born prematurely.How do I start baby-led weaning?If your baby shows signs of readiness, and his doctor says it's okay for your baby to try BLW, start by taking an infant first aid class to make sure you know what to do in case your baby starts choking. (This is important no matter what method you use to feed your baby. A baby can choke on any small item.)Here are some tips for getting started with BLW:For the first couple of months, schedule BLW sessions when your baby isn't hungry. In the beginning, the focus should be on play and exploration. It will take your baby time to learn to eat solids, and in the meantime, he'll still be getting his nutrition primarily from breast milk or formula.BLW is messy. Protect your baby's clothes with a large bib or smock. You may also want to protect your own clothes by putting a mat or newspaper under your baby's highchair for easy cleanup.Make sure you or another adult is watching your baby carefully during meals and knows what to do if your baby starts choking.Make sure your baby is sitting upright in his highchair, not leaning back.Offer your baby soft or well-cooked food cut into sticks or strips that are at least as long as his fist, not bite-size pieces. He will likely try to clasp the food in his fists and smash it into his mouth at first. Over time, he'll learn to grip the food between his thumb and forefinger.Don't offer your baby foods that can pose choking hazards, such as nuts, grapes, popcorn, and foods cut into coins, including sausages and hot dogs.Make sure your baby's food passes the ""squish test"" by checking whether you can squish it on the roof of your mouth with your tongue. That means no raw vegetables and no hard raw fruit (such as apples) or citrus fruit (unless each segment is peeled). The exception is pieces of food that are large and fibrous enough that small pieces don't break off when sucked or chewed. So for example, soft-cooked meat is okay, but cheese sticks are not.Put food directly on the highchair tray or table in front of your baby. (Bowls and plates will just end up on the floor.)Introduce new foods one at a time. Just as with spoon-feeding, it's a good idea to wait two or three days after introducing a new food before trying the next one. That way, if your baby has an allergic reaction, you'll know which food probably caused it.Eat as a family whenever possible. Babies learn to eat by observing and imitating other family members. Family mealtimes also make your baby to feel like part of the group.As with many other parenting approaches, what works for some families won't necessarily work for yours. Some families strictly follow the BLW approach, while others do a combination of BLW and spoon-feeding. For example, you could spoon-feed your baby purees and mashed food sometimes, but allow him to eat finger foods (like the ones listed below) by himself at other times.What are some good foods for BLW?Some foods that are good to use with BLW include:Well-cooked vegetable sticks, including steamed carrots, zucchini, sweet potatoes, and beetsFood with interesting shapes and textures, such as steamed broccoli and cauliflower florets, and chunks of soft avocadoSoft, ripe fruits, including banana, papaya, pear, kiwi, melon, and soft-cooked appleSoft meatballs or large strips of poached chickenPasta in a shape that's easy to grab, like fusilli or penne. Try whole grain or vegetable varieties.Rice rolled into ballsLentil pattiesSalt-free rice cakesAs your baby progresses, she can start learning to dip her food chunks into hummus, yogurt, and guacamole.How can I be sure my baby is getting enough food?It takes babies a while to get used to solid food, so to make sure he gets adequate nutrition, it's important to continue breastfeeding or bottle-feeding your baby during his first year, even after he starts eating solid food. (Your baby's main source of nutrients should be breast milk or formula until about 1 year of age, no matter what else he eats.) As he learns to eat solid food, he'll need less breast milk or formula.Your child's doctor will keep track of your baby's growth at well-child visits, so talk with her if you're concerned about how much your baby eats or weighs.What experts say about baby-led weaningTamara Melton, MS, RDN, LD, Spokesperson for the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, Atlanta, GAI generally feel positive about BLW. I think it's fine for parents to try it as long as the baby continues to receive breast milk or formula until at least 1 year of age.My older daughter did very well with BLW. She loved eating all kinds of foods and had no problem feeding herself soft-cooked fruits, veggies, and yogurt. My younger daughter refused to consume anything but breast milk. She had (and continues to have, at 3 years old) strong preferences about textures and a huge aversion to getting her hands dirty or wet. So BLW didn't work so well for her.BLW saved me time with one daughter, since I didn't have to take the extra step to pure the food. But for the other one, it was stressful and confusing. It was hard for me to figure out what was causing my younger daughter's aversions. So I would say parents should be flexible and be willing to go with whatever works best for each child.Jatinder Bhatia, MD, FAAP, Past chair of the AAP Committee on Nutrition, Chiefof the division of neonatology, Georgia Health Sciences University, Augusta, GAWe have lots of cultural myths about the best way to feed babies, and we're starting to discover that they're myths. There's no scientific rationale for a particular method of feeding.There's no problem with BLW, although there are some cautions. Make sure the food is developmentally appropriate for your child. Stay nearby and watch your child eat. Food for 6-month-olds doesn't need to be pureed, but it should be the texture, consistency, and size that the child can handle.For example, don't give a baby sticky foods like peanut butter or hard foods like raw carrot. (A very soft cooked carrot would be fine.) Soft finger foods are good. Even if a baby doesn't have many teeth, she can still gum foods.Also, it's still a good idea to introduce only one new food at a time for five to seven days to make sure child isn't allergic. And offer a food multiple times before determining that the baby doesn't like that food.What parents say about baby-led weaningIt worked for us""[Baby-led weaning was] one of the best decisions we made with our daughter. She is a fantastic eater and eats a great variety of food. I also believe it made her a great restaurant eater. We always got compliments on how well-behaved she was, and people were always shocked to see a 7-month-old feeding herself in a restaurant."" Michele""BLW worked great for us. I have never felt that because of BLW my son wasn't eating healthy foods. In fact, I thought the opposite because he wasn't getting anything processed. As far as controlled amounts, my son definitely got less food by feeding himself than if I were feeding him, and he didn't know how to say 'no more.'"" Heather""We started baby-led weaning with my little guy when he was 6 months old, and we have never looked back. We were really nervous at first about him choking, but in the four months we've been doing this, he hasn't choked once! I'm a huge advocate for BLW. My son will eat anything that I put in front of him and is so excited to try new foods."" Mandy""I love baby-led weaning, but I agree that it's probably not a magic bullet. I like it because it has freed up a lot of time for me. (I don't have to sit and spoon-feed at every meal.) And it allowed my son to be independent in choosing and eating food. It worked for us because my son was developmentally normal, at a normal weight, and had good manual dexterity, and also because I was able to nurse him quite a lot well past one year."" LauraIt didn't work for us""I couldn't do BLW with my son because he has special needs, and at 13 months only started feeding himself Cheerios with pincer grasp. He also doesn't register being hungry, so if I waited for him to feed himself something he would wither away."" Aly""My oldest had an aversion to getting her hands messy, and never, ever put things in her mouth. If we had chosen to do baby-led weaning, she wouldn't have eaten anything solid until she was almost 3.""

Top 10 baby shower gifts,https://www.babycenter.com/0_top-10-baby-shower-gifts_5387.bc,"A baby shower is a great time for soon-to-be parents to receive the gifts they need to help them get ready for parenthood. Here's our list of top ten baby gifts worth giving new parents.Baby libraryA shelf full of classic children's books is a gift sure to win any parent's heart. Some favorites are Goodnight Moon, Runaway Bunny, and Guess How Much I Love You?.If you love the idea of giving books, consider making it the theme of the shower: Have everyone bring their favorite with a note to the baby tucked inside. Be sure to mix some baby-friendly board books in with the traditional hardcover variety  that way newborns will be able to truly appreciate the sound and the taste of your gift.Baby sling or carrierOne of the easiest ways for a new parent to tote a baby around is in a sling or front carrier. Babies love the warmth and feeling of being snuggled up close to Mom or Dad, and the ingeniously simple design leaves a parent's hands free to do housework or errands while their little one sits safely in a makeshift pouch.Baby ""on-the-go"" essentialsIf you're a parent  or even if you aren't  you know it's virtually impossible to get out of the house without leaving something behind. Help the happy new parents avoid mishaps with a bag full of baby essentials.Start with a diaper bag; add a couple of diapers, some wipes, an extra outfit (or two) for the baby, a bottle of ready-to-feed formula (if she's formula feeding), a couple of small toys (rattles and chew toys are perfect), and a pacifier. If you want, toss in a movie or other gift just for the new parents.Baby bath gearFor a gift that's fun and practical, grab a baby tub and fill it with all the things a new parent needs to keep a baby squeaky clean. Include baby shampoo, a mild soap that won't irritate a newborn's sensitive skin, a soft washcloth (or sponge), a hooded towel, and a bright yellow rubber ducky for good measure.A baby comb and brush are nice additions, as are a couple of simple bath toys, even though an infant won't be able to really play with them for several months. Toss in a bottle of bubble bath for Mom or Dad to use when the baby's asleep, and you're done.Baby beddingSoft, fitted bottom sheets are a perfect addition to any nursery. You'll find colors and patterns to suit every family, from traditional pastels dotted with baby animals to bold black-and-whites and geometric patterns. You can be sure that any new parent will be grateful to have extra linens come laundry day.(Fuzzy blankets pair nicely with sheets, but save them for out-of-the-crib cuddling, as soft bedding is a potential SIDS risk.)Baby sleep kitA basket full of things that make the nursery more soothing after dark can help a new parent survive those first few sleep-deprived months. Fill your sleep kit with a comforting nightlight, a soft blanket, and some soothing music made just for babies (For Crying Out Loud and Lullaby: A Collection are great examples). If you want to splurge, include a white noise sound machine or a special mobile that plays music and projects dancing light pictures on nursery walls.Baby monitorNervous first-time moms and dads will appreciate the reassuring presence of a portable baby monitor receiver on their bedside table. These gadgets have become more and more sophisticated  some models can pick up a baby's faintest breaths within a range of 600 feet or more. Other options include motion sensors that sound an alarm if the baby hasn't moved in a certain period time, and video monitors, which let parents see and hear their baby.Baby bouncy seatKeep a newborn (and parents) happy with a bouncy seat  the baby can wiggle and jiggle to his heart's content, and parents can squeeze in a chore or two knowing he's safe and entertained. This versatile, portable piece of baby gear features cheerful fabric stretched across a metal or plastic frame, with straps to ensure safety. Some models are battery powered for a rhythmic and more soothing bounce.Baby activity gymBabies are enthralled by their environment in general, but you can make it even more fascinating with an activity gym  a contraption that typically includes a cloth mat and toys suspended from soft bars or arches. Colorful mirrors, noisemakers, and other objects of different shapes, sizes, and colors dangle within the baby's grasp, encouraging his developing eyesight and growing physical skills. Portable and lightweight, activity gyms are travel-friendly, whether you're shuttling between rooms or across the country.Comfort foodNothing soothes the nerves of exhausted parents more than a warm and delicious homemade meal. But when the beds are still unmade at 5 in the afternoon and the baby's having a good end-of-the-day cry, the last thing a new mom or dad wants to do is cook. So give new parents what they really want  dinner on someone else.Before you go to the shower, organize a group of the parent-to-be's friends to volunteer to make dinner for the new family after the baby's born. Depending on the number of people involved, you can plan to have hot meals dropped off either nightly or every few days for the first couple of weeks postpartum."
Doctor visit: The 2-month checkup,https://www.babycenter.com/0_doctor-visit-the-2-month-checkup_6586.bc,"To help you prepare for your 2-monthwell-baby checkup, you may want to read through the questions the doctor is likely to ask and jot down answers beforehand.What the doctor will doWeigh and measure your babyYou'll need to undress your baby completely for weighing. The doctor weighs your baby, measures length and head circumference, and plots the numbers on agrowth chart.The chart enables you to see how your baby compares with other children the same age. But it doesn't matter whether she's in the 5th or the 95th percentile, as long as her rate of growth is steady from one visit to the next.Do a complete physicalHeart and lungs: Uses a stethoscope to listen for any abnormal heart rhythms or breathing problems.Eyes: Checks for signs of congenital eye conditions and other problems. May also check for blocked tear ducts and discharge.Ears: Looks for signs ofinfectionand observes how your baby responds to sound.Mouth: Looks for signs ofthrush(an oral yeast infection) among other things.Head: Checks the soft spots (fontanels) and the shape of your baby's head. Also checks to see if your baby's head isdeveloping a flat spot (now's the time to catch it).Body: Checks your baby's reflexes and muscle tone, and examines the skin for rashes.Belly: Presses gently on the abdomen to check for a hernia or any enlarged organs.Genitals: Opens your baby's diaper and checks for signs of infection.Hips and legs: Moves your baby's legs around to look for problems in the hip joints.Give your baby her shotsYour baby will receive thepneumococcal,DTaP,Hib, andpoliovaccines (combined in two shots) and therotavirusvaccine (given orally). She'll also get the secondhepatitis Bnow if she didn't get it at the 1-month checkup.An assistant may administer the vaccines. This is usually done at the end of the appointment so you can have some privacy afterward to comfort your baby.Address any other concernsYour doctor will recommend givingvitamin Ddrops to breastfed babies. (Babies who drink 17 to 32 ounces of formula a day are getting enough vitamin D.)The doctor will also address any health concerns (such asreflux,baby acne, anddiaper rash), ask you some questions (see below), and help you understand what's normal at this age.Questions the doctor may ask:How is your baby sleeping?At this age, many babies are starting to sleep a little longer at night  maybe even staying asleep for a 4- or 5-hour stretch  and less during the day. They're still snoozing 14 to 16 hours a day on average.When, how, and how often is your baby eating?Most 2-month-olds still eat every two to three hours, though they may begin to eat slightly less often later this month. The doctor asksfeedingquestions to determine whether your baby is getting enoughbreast milkorformulato thrive.What are your baby's bowel movements like?Soft feces are best, but color can vary. Dry or pellet-like stools are a sign ofdehydration, or a sign ofconstipation. Tell your doctor if you notice this.What is your baby's crying pattern?If your baby is particularly fussy orcolicky, the doctor may suggestways to soothe him. Have you noticed a change? Many babies begin to ""settle"" at about 8 weeks.How's your baby's head control?Head controlis an important developmental milestone. By now your baby should be able to hold his head up when he's on his stomach.Can your baby push up on his forearms?This development in your baby's strength and coordination, which could happen this month or next, is the precursor to themini-pushuphe'll master at about 4 months.How does your baby respond when you talk to him?At this age, your baby should be cooing on his own and at you  it's one of the first steps in hislanguage development.Does your baby smile?Most babies are smiling voluntarily by this age  it's one of their earliest social behaviors.Have you noticed anything unusual about your baby's eyes or the way he looks at things?At every well-baby visit, the doctor shouldcheck the structure and alignment of the eyesand your baby's ability to move them correctly.How's your baby's hearing?Hearingis mature from birth, so if your baby's not turning toward voices, especially familiar ones, tell the doctor.What's your baby's posture like?By now your baby should have relaxed a bit from the scrunched-up fetal position. His legs should come down when he's lying on his back. But if he's overly limp  he feels like he'll slip out of your arms  or has uneven movements, tell your doctor.Are you giving your baby tummy time when he's awake?Supervisedtummy time when your child is awake and active  helps babies learn to push up,roll over, and eventuallycrawl. It also helps them avoid getting aflat spot on the back of the head.What's next?Find out what's in store at the4-month doctor visit.Show sources Hide sources Mayo Clinic. Undated.

Breastfeeding after breast reduction surgery,https://www.babycenter.com/0_breastfeeding-after-breast-reduction-surgery_8691.bc,"ConditionBreast reduction surgeryThe potential problemSurgical reduction of the breasts can damage nerves and milk-producing ducts and glands, making breastfeeding difficult.Can I breastfeed?Probably. If your nipple and areola are still attached to the breast tissue beneath them, there's a good chance you'll be able to nurse. However, if the nipple was removed and then placed on a reconstructed breast, damage to the nerves, milk ducts, and breast tissue may limit your milk flow and diminish sensation in your nipples. Nerves are vital to breastfeeding because they trigger the release of prolactin and oxytocin, two hormones that affect milk production and letdown.In general, the longer it's been since the surgery, the more sensation you're likely to have in your nipple and areola and the more milk you're likely to produce.SolutionYou won't know exactly how your milk supply is affected until you start trying to nurse. If you still have feeling in the nipple, you have a much better chance of having a full supply. Ask a lactation expert for guidance and support.Also let your baby's doctor know about your surgery. She'll need to keep a close eye on your baby's weight gain to make sure he's getting enough to eat. (Learn how to tell if your baby's getting enough milk.)On the third day postpartum, you can try pumping for five minutes on each breast after every nursing session to help build your milk supply. It's likely that you'll need to use a fully automated pump that pumps both breasts at once to stimulate your letdown reflex.If you're able to produce only part of the milk your baby needs, you'll need to supplement with banked breast milk or formula.In the first few weeks postpartum, you might consider using a supplemental nursing system (SNS). The device consists of a plastic pouch to hold breast milk or formula attached to thin, flexible tubes that run down the breasts to each nipple. Since your baby takes both nipple and tube into his mouth when he suckles, he benefits from all the breast milk that's available while stimulating your breasts to produce more.If you're thinking about having your breasts reduced but want to be able to nurse your babies, postpone surgery until after you've weaned your last child. This is a good idea anyway because your breasts can change so much when you're pregnant and nursing."
Medical equipment your preemie may need and how to use it,https://www.babycenter.com/0_medical-equipment-your-preemie-may-need-and-how-to-use-it_10300034.bc,"Most babies who graduate from the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) don't need special medical equipment when they leave the hospital. But some NICU babies are strong enough to go home but still need help from special equipment.If your baby is discharged with medical equipment, learn how to use it and practice using it before she leaves the hospital. Usually the company that provides the equipment will send someone to the NICU or to your home to show you how to use it properly.The three most common types of equipment that babies go home with are an apnea monitor, a feeding tube, and oxygen.Apnea monitorMany babies have episodes of apnea (a periodic interruption of breathing). If a baby hasn't outgrown the problem in the hospital, she may temporarily need an apnea monitor at home.The monitor is attached to the baby with soft, sticky patches or a soft belt that goes around her chest. If the baby stops breathing, or if her heartbeat is too fast or too slow, the monitor sounds an alarm.You may use the monitor when your baby is sleeping or when you aren't in the same room. Before your baby leaves the hospital, you'll learn:What to do when the alarm goes offWhen to call your baby's healthcare providerSometimes the alarm goes off when there's nothing wrong with your baby. This can happen when the belt is placed incorrectly or becomes loose when the baby moves around. You'll learn how to recognize these false alarms and what to do to help avoid them.Feeding tubes and syringeSome babies can't suck or swallow well enough to take in the nutrients they need for healthy growth. This is more likely in babies with problems involving the heart, lungs, mouth, esophagus, airways, or central nervous system.When these babies go home, they may need to continue to be fed breast milk or formula through a tube (gavage feeding). The tube is inserted into the baby's nose or mouth, down the back of the throat, through the esophagus, and into the stomach. (The esophagus connects the mouth and the stomach.) This tube usually stays in place between feedings and doesn't bother the baby.You feed your baby by pouring breast milk or formula into a syringe and adding it to your baby's feeding tube.If your baby isn't able to take in enough food by mouth for an extended period, she may need to be fed through an opening in her stomach (gastrostomy). This opening has a small plastic feeding tube attached to it. OxygenMost babies can breathe on their own before they leave the NICU, but a few need extra oxygen for a while. Their lungs often heal over the first two years of life.Babies often need oxygen at home if they have a lung disorder called bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD). Babies at risk for BPD include those who:Had severe respiratory distress syndrome (RDS)Needed long-term treatment with mechanical ventilation and oxygenIf your baby needs oxygen, you'll need:Stationary oxygen tanks (the kind that stay in one place and don't move)Portable oxygen tanks (the kind you can move or take with you)Nasal cannula (soft plastic tubing that goes around a baby's head)The hospital may arrange for a home health nurse to visit your home to check on your baby. She may also be on call to answer your questions or concerns. If this isn't arranged, speak to the NICU social worker or your baby's healthcare provider to see if you can get this service.Over time, your baby's lungs heal and breathing becomes easier. The amount of oxygen is gradually cut back, then stopped altogether. Most babies need oxygen for less than six months.If your baby goes home on oxygen, you must observe several safety measures. Oxygen can catch fire easily. Even a small spark can start a big fire. Don't allow smoking, a burning fire, sparks, or gas stove in the same room as the oxygen tank."
How to buy feeding supplies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_how-to-buy-feeding-supplies_10310518.bc,"The lowdown on feeding suppliesWhether your child is sampling mashed bananas for the first time or digging into a spaghetti dinner as only a toddler can, you'll need dinnerware and utensils designed for his needs. Eating and self-feeding skills develop over time, and your child's ability to drink from a cup and hold a fork or spoon will gradually improve. With this in mind, you can choose utensils that help with every phase.Browse dozens of bowls, cups and other feeding supplies.Cups You may need to try a few different styles of sippy cup before your child gets the hang of drinking from one, or finds one he really likes.Two factors to consider: ease of sipping and whether the cup leaks. No-spill cups with vacuum valves (a flexible diaphragm below the spout) may seem ideal because they dont leak, but kids have to work harder to get a drink from them, so they may frustrate beginners without good oral control.Traditional cups with perforated sipper spouts are easy for a child to drink from but tend to dribble. More modern designs have various no-spill methods, including rubber gaskets that fit over the top of the cup (and enable kids to drink from anywhere on it) and silicone tops that slip over a regular plastic cup to turn it into a sippy.Age range: Some brands have spouts for babies as young as 3 months, although it's more common to introduce a cup when a child is 6 months or older. Kids typically use sippy cups up until around age 3 or 4.Tip: When cups are part of a childs routine from an early age, theyll make weaning from the breast or bottle that much easier.Dinnerware Once your baby starts eating solids, you'll want dishes that she can call her own  and safely pitch across the kitchen. Dining sets for babies and young kids are durable, bright, and dishwasher-safe, and typically include a plate and bowl. Baby and toddler dinnerware is usually made of plastic but also comes in stainless steel, glass, bamboo, and silicone. (If you choose plastic, see below for safety notes on BPA).Some parents swear by bowls with suction cups that attach to the highchair tray, although babies can quickly outgrow the need for them or get strong enough to pull off the suction cups.Age range: Youll typically need kiddie dishes once your child begins eating solids at around 4 to 6 months old. Utensils Soft-tipped spoons designed for babies are gentle on tender gums. Some have heat-sensitive coatings, so they'll change color to show you when food is too hot. Ones for self-feeding should have wide or looped handles that are easy for a baby to grasp. Some spoon and fork sets have fun designs to make feeding more fun.Age range: You'll start using spoons when you introduce your baby to solids at 4 to 6 months old. Shortly after age 6 months, he'll probably want to try holding her own spoon. It'll be a few more months before his coordination has developed enough to get food from bowl to mouth with a utensil. At about 18 months old, children may be ready to hold and use a fork with soft edges and tips that wont poke little mouths.Tip: A child's spoon and fork set is a great reward for good table manners. You'll make an impression on your toddler when you offer one up and say, ""you're a big kid now!""Feeding accessories There are plenty of accessories that make feeding your child easier. Popular ones include reusable squeeze pouches parents can fill with pured or soft foods, snack traps that allow babies to reach in and get food without spilling, and net bags that hold a piece of fruit for a baby to safely suck on. There are also great options for when youre on the go, including portable miniature food grinders and special insulated totes and carrying bags for snacks and meals at the park or on a plane. There are even systems that dispense formula similar to the way K-cup machines deliver coffee.If you're making your own baby food, youll find systems that do it all including cooking, blending, and packaging. You can also buy racks that organize baby-food jars in your cupboard.Age range: You'll need these accessories from around the time your child starts solids (at 4 to 6 months old) to when he's about 3 years old. You might keep using items like insulated bags to carry snacks in for years to come.Ready to introduce solid foods? Find out how.Important safety notesBPA, an ingredient used in plastic to make it hard and clear, was banned by the FDA from use in baby bottles and cups in 2012 after concerns were raised about its role as an endocrine disrupter. Most plastic infant and toddler feeding products on the market are labeled BPA-free. Some experts are still concerned with chemicals in plastic, and advise parents to avoid plastic tableware and storage ware (the American Academy of Pediatrics hasnt yet weighed in).Experts generally agree that plasticware should not go in the microwave or the dishwasher; to learn more about the risks, read our article, ""Are plastic baby bottles and formula cans safe?"" Parents may want to consider alternatives to plastic such as glass, stainless steel, bamboo, and silicone.In recent years, cups have been recalled for parts that break off and become choking hazards, lids that shatter and become a laceration hazard, and spoon and fork handles that break off. Check BabyCenters Product Recall Finder to make sure the products you use havent been recalled.What its going to cost youSippy or straw cups cost about $3 to $20 each, with plastic ones on the lower end of the range and silicone and stainless-steel cups on the higher end. Toddler and baby plates and bowls cost from $2 to $25, with dinnerware sets running $10 to $40 and fancy china keepsake sets selling for $40 or more. For about $6, you can get a bowl that folds up for travel.Spoon and fork sets cost $3 to $6, although designer stainless-steel sets can run you $30 or more. Feeding accessories range widely, from $2 to $10 or more for containers to $200 for top-of-the-line baby-food makers.Download our illustrated guide to feeding suppliesShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

The worst foods for babies,https://www.babycenter.com/0_the-worst-foods-for-babies_10320507.bc,"Babies don't need many calories, but they do need lots of nutrients. Yet some foods commonly offered to babies are essentially junk food  high in calories, sugar, or salt, and low in nutrients.Because babies are so small, it's easy for them to fill up quickly on the empty calories in junk food, leaving no room for nutrient-rich healthy foods. This nutritional deficit can even hinder development, says doctor and Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics spokesperson Christine Gerbstadt.That's why it's important to know which foods are best for babies and which ones to avoid, including junk food and potential choking hazards. Here's our list of the worst food choices for babies.Hot dogs and other dangerous foodsHard, sticky, slippery, chunky, and round foods are unsafe for young children because they can easily choke on them. So don't give your baby hot dogs, sausages, large pieces of meat or cheese, whole grapes, popcorn, chunky raw vegetables, and whole nuts and seeds.And once you start serving your baby finger foods, be sure to cut food into pieces no larger than half an inch.SodaSome babies are served soft drinks daily as early as 9 months of age, according to a 2008 survey of infant and toddler feeding habits. The same survey found that by 24 months, more than 10 percent of toddlers were drinking soda every day.Whether regular or diet, soda provides absolutely no nutrients, and filling up on either type means babies eat and drink less of the nutritious food their bodies really need. Regular soda also contains loads of sugar, which can cause tooth decay.How to care for your baby's teeth and gums Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 5:07Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -5:07Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosFrench friesAnother major 2008 study found that about 14 percent of 9-month-olds eat fries at least once a week. That figure goes up to more than 40 percent by 12 months of age, making french fries among the top vegetables consumed by toddlers  and marking the start of an unhealthy habit.It's a good idea to minimize all fast food because it's loaded with fat, sugar, salt, and calories but low in healthy nutrients. If you do need to grab a bite on the go, look for baby-friendly options. Many chains now offer healthier choices, including yogurt and applesauce.Processed foodsPeople define 'processed' in different ways, but in general, the more the food is modified from what was originally caught, raised, or grown  and the longer the list of ingredients  the more processed it is.""The more processed the food, the more nutritional value tends to go down, and the more the sugar, salt, and fat content goes up,"" says Kate Geagan, dietitian and author ofGo Green, Get Lean.Meals made specifically for babies can be healthy and appropriate. The best prepared baby foods have few ingredients and no added salt, sugar, or modified food starch.But ready-to-eat foods meant for older children and adults are definitely not good for babies. ""They often contain way too much sodium,"" says dietitian Eileen Behan, author ofThe Baby Food Bible.For example, instead of serving canned pasta entrees, it's better to boil some noodles and sprinkle some cheese on top. And instead of serving deli meats, which are often high in sodium and carry a risk of food poisoning, cut up small bits of roast chicken or hamburger.Gelatin dessertsMost varieties are nearly all sugar, artificial color, and artificial flavor with a small amount of gelatin to make it wiggly. Homemade gelatin made with fruit juice and sugar eliminates the artificial additives, but it's still essentially just fruit juice and sweetener.True, gelatin is easy to swallow, but so is Gerbstadt's suggestion for a healthy, baby-friendly dessert: a baked, mashed apple with a sprinkle of cinnamon. ""It's naturally sweet and has good fiber, vitamins, and a yummy, smooth texture,"" she says.Juice and fruit drinksSure, these beverages contain fruit, but that doesn't mean they're healthy. The fiber in fresh fruit is largely lost in the juicing process, and what's left is a whole lot of sugar. Juice can also cause diarrhea in some babies.""Juice is basically a waste of calories,"" says pediatrician Ari Brown, coauthor of Baby 411: Clear Answers and Smart Advice for Your Baby's First Year. Using juice to sweeten your baby's food isn't a good idea either: The sugars in juice can make food pass through the digestive tract more quickly, interfering with the body's ability to absorb nutrients.And don't be fooled by advertisers' claims that juice provides babies with necessary vitamin C. ""Babies can easily get their vitamin C from one small serving of fruit,"" says Brown.5 tips to develop healthy eating habits Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:05Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:05Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

The AAP recommends offering your baby no more than 4 to 6 ounces of 100 percent fruit juice a day. (Don't serve anything labeled fruit ""drink,"" ""cocktail,"" or ""beverage"" because these often contain only a tiny amount of juice and a lot of water, sweetener, and food coloring.)Babies 6 to 12 months old can have small amounts of water, but breast milk or formula should still be their main beverage. After your baby's first birthday,cow's milkis recommended (though your toddler can continue breastfeeding as long as you both enjoy it).Learn more:Age-by-age guide to feeding your babyBaby food revolution: New rules for feeding your babyHow to make your own baby foodShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a.

They can become dehydrated if they drink less fluid than they lose through sweating on a hot summer day, for example.Preventing dehydration in young babiesNewborns can't regulate their body temperature, so they get overheated easily, says Tanya Remer Altmann, a pediatrician in Westlake Village, California, and author of Mommy Calls: Dr. Tanya Answers Parents' Top 101 Questions About Babies and Toddlers. Offer breast milk or formula to keep them hydrated.In general, it's not a good idea to give water to babies under age 6 months. They get all the hydration they need from breast milk or formula, even in hot weather. Not only do they not need water, but drinking water places them at risk of water intoxication (over-dilution of the bloodstream), which can cause seizures.See how our expert answers this question: When can my baby drink water?Preventing dehydration in children 12 months and olderMake sure kids have access to water, says Altmann, and encourage them to take a water break after an hour of playing outside.Pediatrician Jeffrey W. Britton adds that if the water must be flavored, that's okay. He says other snacks with water in them are fine, including ice pops and snow cones, as long as you watch the total daily sugar and calorie intake.""Most children drink water eagerly if offered. In fact, not encouraging water as the primary drink can backfire. When offered the choice between water and something sweet, many kids will choose sweet,"" he adds. ""By using water as the primary hydration source and offering sugary drinks as an occasional treat only, parents can foster the habit of water drinking.""Watermelon makes a great snack on hot days, says Altmann: ""It's chock-full of fiber, nutrients, and water.""Learn moreHow to spot dehydration and what to do about itSlide show: The best and worst drinks for thirsty kidsShow sources Hide sources AAP. 2011.

Helping a child who's underweight (ages 5 to 8),https://www.babycenter.com/0_helping-a-child-whos-underweight-ages-5-to-8_66923.bc,"How can I tell if my child is too skinny?There are several factors to take into consideration when evaluating your child's weight. Has he always been thin? Are both of his parents very thin? A child who has a genetic tendency to be thin is in a different boat than a child who has always been normal to hefty and who has recently stopped gaining  or started losing  weight. Even if your child has just recently thinned out, though, there may be nothing to worry about.""Keep in mind that a child's weight is dynamic and changes with growth,"" says Stephen R. Daniels, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition.When an increase in height precedes a gain in weight, Daniels explains, your child may appear underweight for a while, until his weight gain catches up. It's also possible, though, for your child's weight gain to eventually outstrip his gain in height, resulting in his becoming overweight. Doctors are very concerned that many children are becoming overweight as they grow older, Daniels says, and some of those children started out as underweight.The best way to determine whether your child is underweight  and to find out what to do about it  is to make an appointment with his doctor so she can help you evaluate his weight and his diet.How will the doctor determine whether my child is underweight?Your child's doctor will take into consideration the factors mentioned above  how much his parents weigh and how long he's been thin. She'll also evaluate your child's eating habits and his overall health. She'll probably ask if your child has had any medical problems that may have contributed to weight loss, like chronic diarrhea or vomiting.The doctor will measure your child's height and weight and plot these numbers on a growth chart. Doctors today are using a new series of growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that take into consideration a child's body mass index, or BMI, which considers weight together with height to help determine whether they are proportional. The BMI is a better indicator of body composition than a weight measurement alone. While an adult's BMI is calculated with a straight formula of height and weight, the formula to determine a child's BMI takes into consideration gender and age as well, to allow for the fact that body composition changes as a child gets older.If your child's BMI falls below the 5th percentile, he's considered underweight. The doctor will ask you questions about your child's diet, so she can pinpoint any major deficiencies. She may have you refer to the Food Guide Pyramid, so you can determine which food groups your child may not be getting enough of. She'll do a physical examination and may run laboratory tests to determine if there's an underlying medical cause, especially if your child seems to be eating well but not gaining weight. How can I help my child gain weight?Assuming your child has no underlying medical concerns, the idea will be to get him to take in more calories. For some children, simply adding foods that are ""heart-healthy"" sources of fat such as avocados, nuts, and vegetable oils  provides enough additional calories to meet the demands of growth. Try to plan healthy, calorie-dense meals and snacks for your child so he gets enough to eat.Whatever you do, don't feed your child ""junk food"" in an effort to promote weight gain, warns Daniels. Eating habits are ingrained early in life, and they may be difficult to change once they become established.Make mealtimes pleasant and unrushed. Sit down together whenever you can and enjoy your food and time together. Involve your child in meal planning, shopping (enlist his help picking out fruit at the market and bread at the bakery, for example), and food preparation, to encourage his interest in food and eating. Also, don't let your child get so wrapped up doing something that he skips meals. He needs to be eating frequently if you want him to gain weight.Here is a list of healthy high-calorie foods that you might offer your child:Dairy: Whole milk, cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, creamed soups, puddingProtein: Eggs, peanut butter, bean soups, nutsCarbohydrates: Bread, macaroni and cheese, pasta, French toast, pancakes, mashed potatoes, hot cerealIf your child is a picky eater and refuses to add new foods to his diet, his doctor may recommend a high-calorie supplement drink. These supplements taste like milkshakes and provide additional vitamins and minerals that your child may be missing out on.Make sure, though, that your child isn't filling up on beverages  like juices or even milk  so that he's not hungry for meals. Try to limit juice to no more than one cup a day and milk to no more than two cups a day.While you'll be eager to check on his progress, don't start subjecting your child to regular weigh-ins at home, because they may make him anxious and self-conscious about his weight. However, your doctor may want to see your child once a month to monitor his progress. Treat these visits like any other to the doctor, and don't make a big deal about the weigh-in process.What if my child doesn't start gaining weight?If your child is getting enough calories but still does not seem to be gaining weight appropriately, continue to work with his doctor to discover any underlying conditions. On the other hand, if your child is refusing to eat, there may be a psychological reason that you'll want to discuss with a child therapist. Your child's doctor can provide a referral.Chances are good, though, that with some patience and some conscientious meal and snack plans, your child will strike a good height/weight balance."
Lactose intolerance,https://www.babycenter.com/0_lactose-intolerance_1201464.bc,"What is lactose intolerance?When you're lactose intolerant, it means your body can't produce enough lactase, the enzyme needed to digest lactose, the primary sugar in cow's milk and other dairy products. As a result, the undigested lactose stays in the intestine and causes gastrointestinal problems. These problems tend to be uncomfortable but not dangerous.Babies who are born prematurely sometimes can't produce adequate amounts of lactase for a while. A baby's level normally increases during the end of the last trimester of pregnancy.True lactose intolerance usually shows up in the grade-school or teen years. While it's possible for symptoms to appear earlier, it's very unlikely that your baby is lactose intolerant.What causes lactose intolerance?We don't know why some people are lactose intolerant and others aren't, but it's not rare. Between 30 and 50 million people in the United States are lactose intolerant.Genetics play a role: About 90 percent of Asian Americans  and as many as 75 percent of African American, Hispanic American, Jewish, and Native American adults  are lactose intolerant. About 15 percent of people of northern European descent have the condition.Very rarely, a baby is born with lactose intolerance. (Both parents would have to pass the gene for this type of lactose intolerance to the baby.) From birth, the baby would have severe diarrhea and be unable to tolerate the lactose in his mother's breast milk or in formula made from cow's milk. He'd need a special, lactose-free infant formula.If your baby has had a severe case of diarrhea, his body may temporarily have trouble producing lactase, and he may have symptoms of lactose intolerance for a week or two.Some medications can also cause the body to produce lower levels of lactase, causing temporary lactose intolerance. People with long-term conditions that affect the intestines (like celiac disease or Crohn's disease) sometimes suffer from lactose intolerance as well.What are the symptoms of lactose intolerance?If your baby is lactose intolerant, he may have diarrhea, abdominal cramping, bloating, or gas about 30 minutes to two hours after drinking breast milk or eating dairy products, like cheese or yogurt, once he starts eating solids. (Babies should not drink cow's milk until their first birthday.)Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.Some lactose-intolerant people can consume a small amount of dairy without symptoms. Others will be uncomfortable every time they have food containing even a small amount of lactose.Is lactose intolerance the same as a milk allergy?No. An allergy is an immune response, while lactose intolerance is a digestive condition. The symptoms can be similar, however. Abdominal pain or diarrhea after consuming milk products could be caused by a milk allergy or by lactose intolerance, for example.If your baby develops a dry, itchy rash or itching and swelling of the face, lips, or mouth whenever he has dairy products  or symptoms such as hives, watery eyes, or a runny nose  he may be allergic to one of the proteins in cow's milk.How will I know for sure if my baby is lactose intolerant?Again, it's very unlikely that your baby is showing signs of lactose intolerance at this age, but talk with his doctor. She'll ask about your baby's symptoms to help determine whether it's a possibility. She may suggest that you eliminate all sources of lactose from your baby's diet for a couple of weeks to see whether his symptoms subside.Can lactose intolerance be treated or prevented?No, but there are things you can do to help your baby if he's lactose intolerant.Read labels. You'll want to avoid dairy products and all other foods that contain lactose. Some seemingly innocuous foods contain milk products: pancake and cookie mixes, breakfast cereals, instant potatoes and soups, margarine, salad dressings, breads, and lunch meats. Check food labels for ingredients such as whey, curds, milk byproducts, dry milk solids, and nonfat dry milk powder.Thanks to recent legislation, products containing milk ingredients (or other common allergens) must be clearly labeled as such. This should make your task much easier.Watch how your baby reacts. Some people who are lactose intolerant can digest small amounts of lactose, while others are very sensitive to the tiniest quantities. You'll probably learn through trial and error how much of which dairy foods your baby can handle.Some cheeses have less lactose than others, for example, so they may be easier to digest. And live-culture yogurt is generally easier to digest than milk and other dairy products because the healthy bacteria in it helps produce lactase.If your baby is very sensitive, you'll want to avoid all sources of lactose. If not, you may be able to give him small amounts of selected dairy foods. He may find it easier to tolerate dairy products if he eats them along with other foods.Make sure all of your baby's nutritional needs are being met. If you find that you need to eliminate dairy products from your baby's diet as he grows, you'll want to be sure that he has other sources of calcium, which helps bones and teeth grow strong. Nondairy sources of calcium include leafy greens, fortified juices and soy milk, tofu, broccoli, canned salmon, oranges, and fortified breads.Other nutrients to be concerned about are vitamins A and D, riboflavin, and phosphorus. See our article on food sources of various nutrients for suggestions on how your child can get the nutrients he needs from nondairy sources. You might also find it helpful to consult a dietitian.Lactose-free dairy products are now available in many grocery stores. They have all the nutrients of regular dairy products without the lactose.And finally, if you find that it's difficult to get your baby all the nutrition he needs without dairy products, talk with his doctor about whether your baby might benefit from taking supplements.Show sources Hide sources AAP.

Your 1-week-old's development,https://www.babycenter.com/0_your-1-week-olds-development_1477163.bc,"She only has eyes for youYour baby's eyesight is still pretty fuzzy. Babies are born nearsighted and can see things best when they're about 8 to 10 inches away, so she can see your face clearly only when you're holding her close.Don't worry if your baby doesn't look you right in the eye from the start: Newborns tend to look at your eyebrows, your hairline, or your moving mouth. As she gets to know you in the first month, she'll be more interested in having eye-to-eye exchanges. Studies show that newborns prefer human faces to all other patterns or colors. (High-contrast items, like a checkerboard, are next in line.)Give your baby plenty of opportunities to study your features by looking at her up close. As you or your partner feeds her, move your head slowly from side to side and see whether her eyes follow you. This exercise can help strengthen the eye muscles. (Don't be alarmed if your baby looks at you with crossed eyes: It's normal for a newborn's eyes to wander or cross now and then during the first month or so of life.)Babies are sensitive to light and can see in three dimensions. Notice how your baby blinks when you bring an object close to her.Weighty issueIf you're breastfeeding, you may be wondering whether your baby's getting enough to eat because she may seem to be hungry all the time. She probably is, since she's digesting breast milk within a couple of hours of consuming it.Some signs that your breastfed baby's getting enough milk: Your breasts are being emptied and feel softer after nursing, your baby has good color and firm skin that bounces right back if pinched (if you pinch a dehydrated baby, the skin will stay puckered briefly), your baby is growing in both length and weight, you can hear her swallowing while nursing (if the room is quiet), she's passing mustard-yellow stools or frequent dark stools, and she has at least five to six wet disposable diapers a day (or seven to eight cloth diapers).Whether you're nursing or formula-feeding your newborn, keep in mind that all babies grow at different rates and that their rate of growth tends to slow down at certain times. In addition, if your baby was big at birth, she won't grow as quickly to move closer to her predestined size.If your little one is hitting her developmental milestones pretty much on time, relating well to you, and looking otherwise happy and healthy, she's most likely doing fine. But if regular weight checks at the doctor's office indicate that your baby isn't developing at a healthy rate, she might not be eating well or might not be absorbing or using nutrients properly.Number twoIn the early days, your newborn's bowel movements are thick and dark green because of meconium  a substance that was building up in her intestines while she was in the womb. As your baby starts to feed and the meconium is cleared out, her stools will start to turn yellowish, but they may vary in color daily depending on your diet if you're breastfeeding or the quantity and type of formula you're feeding her, as well as how hydrated your baby is.A newborn can have as many as eight to 12 bowel movements a day, but as long as she's having at least one, she's probably all right. (If you're breastfeeding, your baby's stools may look softer, like diarrhea.)Simon saysEven this early, babies can recognize faces and gestures intuitively  and sometimes even imitate them. Try putting your face close to hers and sticking out your tongue or raising your eyebrows a few times. Then give your baby some time to mimic your gesture.Even if your baby doesn't copy your expression now, she's keeping close tabs  and learning. If you interact with her and she doesn't seem receptive at all, don't worry. She may have gotten sleepy or a bit overwhelmed and need to take a break.Tummy timeYoung babies spend a lot of time sleeping, and to reduce the risk of SIDS, the safest sleep position is on their back. But when your baby's awake  and in the coming weeks she'll have more and more ""awake"" time  be sure to put her on her tummy. Babies need to spend time on their belly every day to strengthen their neck muscles. So start getting her used to that position now, or she may resist when she gets older.Remember, your baby's an individualAll babies are unique and meet milestones at their own pace. Developmental guidelines simply show what your baby has the potential to accomplish  if not right now, then soon. If your baby was premature, keep in mind that kids born early usually need a bit more time to meet their milestones.

Your 4-month-old's development: Week 1,https://www.babycenter.com/0_your-4-month-olds-development-week-1_1477216.bc,"Beginning to understand the role of languageResearchers believe that your baby can now understand all the basic sounds that make up his native language. Between this time and 6 months of age, your baby will develop the ability to make some vocal sounds, which means you may hear the words you've been dreaming about, namely ""ma-ma"" or ""da-da."" While child development experts say it's too early for your baby to connect those sounds with you and your partner, that won't make hearing them any less exciting.You can encourage your baby's attempts at communication by mirroring or imitating his expressions and sounds. He may try to imitate you now, too. Say ""baa"" and he may try to say it back.Reacting when your baby makes noises or tries to say something will help your baby learn the importance of language. It'll also help him better understand cause and effect. It's great for his self-esteem, too. He'll begin to realize that what he says makes a difference.Expand on what your baby says and try to give it meaning. For example, you can say, ""Yes, that is a ball!"" Soon, his ""ba"" will become ""ball.""Time for solid food?For the first four to six months of life, your baby gets all the nutrients he needs from breast milk or formula. Still, parents are often eager to start their babies on solid food.It's true that your baby's digestive tract is more developed now and his tongue-thrust reflex is starting to fade, so it seems a logical time to start feeding him some solids, such as pureed baby food or cereal. But there are good reasons to wait, too.Starting solids later may cut down on possible allergic reactions, and ensures that breast milk or formula won't get crowded out of your baby's diet. And if you're hoping that eating solids will help your baby sleep through the night, studies have shown that you can't count on that happening.The debate over when to start solids continues. If you're unsure about when to introduce them to your baby, talk to his doctor.Remember, your baby is an individualAll babies are unique and meet milestones at their own pace.

Weaning your toddler,https://www.babycenter.com/0_weaning-your-toddler_1736063.bc,"What does it mean to have weaned a child?When your child stops nursing and gets all his nutrition from sources other than the breast, he's considered weaned. Although children are also weaned from the bottle, the term most often refers to when a child stops breastfeeding.Weaning, when it's the mother's idea, usually requires a lot of patience and can take time, depending on your child's age and how well and how quickly he adjusts. The experience is different for everyone.Weaning is a long goodbye  emotional, sometimes painful, and freeing at the same time. But weaning needn't signal an end to the intimacy you and your child have established through breastfeeding. It just means you have to replace breastfeeding with other nourishment and nurturing activities. If you've often nursed your child for comfort, find other ways to make him feel better. Read a book or sing a song together, or play outside instead.When should I start weaning?You're the best judge of when it's time to wean, and you don't have to set a deadline unless you and your child are ready to do so. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that mothers breastfeed their children for at least a year. Despite what friends, relatives, or even strangers may say, there's no right or wrong time to wean. If you feel it's the right time, then it is.How do I wean?Proceed slowly, regardless of the age of your child. Experts advise that you not abruptly withhold your breast, which can be traumatic. A weekend away from your toddler with your partner, for example, is not a good way to end the breastfeeding relationship. Try these methods instead:Skip a feeding. Skip a feeding and see what happens. Offer a cup or bottle of milk instead. As a substitute you can use your own pumped milk, formula, or cow's milk. If you reduce feedings one at a time over a period of weeks your child will have time to adjust to the changes. Your milk supply will also diminish, without leaving your breasts engorged or giving you mastitis, a breast infection.Shorten nursing time. Start by cutting the length of time your child is actually on the breast. If he usually nurses for five minutes, try three. Follow the feeding with a healthy snack like unsweetened applesauce or a cup of milk or formula. Bedtime feedings may be harder to curb  they're usually the last to go.Postpone and distract. Try postponing feedings if you're only nursing a couple of times a day. This method works well if you have an older child you can reason with. If your child asks for the breast, say you'll feed him later and distract him. Instead of nursing in the early evening, you could tell him to wait until bedtime.What to do when weaning becomes a struggleIf you've tried everything to wean your child and nothing is working, maybe the time isn't right. Have you recently gone back to work? Your child may still be adjusting to this new development. Has your child been sick? Often children who aren't feeling well will want to nurse more often  in fact, breastfeeding may be in a sick child's best interest.Has your household gone through a major life change, such as a move or a divorce? Events such as these will also make weaning more difficult. Even going through a new developmental stage can make it hard to wean. Try again in another month. Sooner or later, it'll happen."
Iron-deficiency anemia and breastfeeding,https://www.babycenter.com/0_iron-deficiency-anemia-and-breastfeeding_10414725.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineI have iron-deficiency anemia. Can I breastfeed?Yes. Breastfeeding is good for you and your baby, even if when you have iron-deficiency anemia. If you want to breastfeed your baby, you can do so safely.It's true that you lose iron through breast milk, but if you breastfeed exclusively, it's unlikely that you'll get your period for four to six months. And not losing iron through your menstrual blood helps your iron stores stay balanced.Are iron supplements necessary if I'm breastfeeding?If you had anemia during pregnancy, check with your healthcare provider to see if you need to continue taking iron supplements when breastfeeding.Iron supplements are perfectly safe to take when you're breastfeeding. For breastfeeding women, the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) for iron is 9 milligrams (mg) per day.If you lost a lot of blood during birth from a postpartum hemorrhage, you may have your hemoglobin level tested after birth. The test assesses the severity of your anemia and whether you still need to take an iron supplement. It's possible you may need a transfusion.If you're worried about your iron level (if you feel extremely tired, for example), ask your provider to give you a blood test. If you're anemic, she's likely to recommend more iron supplements.What are alternatives to breastfeeding?If you're not able to breastfeed (or choose not to), it's still important to ensure that your baby gets enough iron. Choose iron-fortified formula so your baby gets the right amount of iron from day one.Don't give your baby cow's milk before the age of 1 because it's very low in iron. After age 1, limit the amount of cow's milk you give your child to no more than 24 ounces daily.Will my baby need an iron supplement?If your baby was born prematurely or had a low birth weight, then she probably won't have as much iron stored in her body as a larger or full-term infant. If this is the case, she may need iron drops. Follow your healthcare provider's advice about how much iron to give your baby, and keep iron drops out of your baby's reach.If you've had anemia, it's understandable to worry that your baby will be low in iron too, but that's not necessarily the case. Feeding her breast milk, which is naturally rich in iron, or iron-fortified formula, will give her the best start in life.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources CDC. 1998.

I'm HIV positive. How will it affect my baby?,https://www.babycenter.com/0_im-hiv-positive-how-will-it-affect-my-baby_10415059.bc,"Approved by the Society for Maternal-Fetal MedicineIf I'm HIV positive, does that mean my baby will be too?Not necessarily. With the right treatment, the risk of a baby being HIV positive is less than 1 percent.Can I prevent my unborn baby from contracting HIV?Yes. There's a lot you can do to protect your baby from exposure to HIV. The key is to continue taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) and attend all your prenatal appointments.The goal of ART is to reduce the amount of HIV in your blood to an undetectable level. This protects your baby from the virus during pregnancy and delivery. ART requires careful monitoring by a healthcare provider.If you're HIV positive, your baby will also receive medication at birth as additional protection in case she comes in contact with HIV during delivery. After your baby is born, she'll most likely be given an antiretroviral medicine called zidovudine (ZDV) for four to six weeks.Some babies receive additional HIV medication. This usually happens if you don't get the recommended treatment during pregnancy.How does HIV spread to a baby?HIV is transmitted through blood or bodily fluids including semen, vaginal fluids, and breast milk. There are four ways mother-to-baby transmission of HIV may happen:HIV crosses the placenta and infects a baby during pregnancy.A baby is exposed to the virus in the blood or other fluids during delivery. Most babies who get HIV this way are infected around the time of delivery.A baby can get HIV from breast milk. That's why a provider may recommend formula feeding if you're HIV positive.A baby can get HIV if he has cuts or sores in the mouth. When a baby is older, don't share food that's already chewed. Although the risk is small, blood from cuts or sores in the mouth could mix with food when it's chewed. The blood in the food could then infect him.You can't give your baby HIV by cuddling him, kissing him, bathing him, or generally taking care of him.When will I know if my baby is HIV positive or not?Your healthcare provider will test your baby for HIV several times in the first six months. The tests look for the virus in your baby's blood, but it can take a while for HIV to be detectable, especially if your baby is already on an antiretroviral drug.The first test is likely to happen when your baby is between 2 and 3 weeks old, with follow-up tests at 1 to 2 months and again at 4 to 6 months.Some babies at high risk of HIV transmission are tested at birth. If your baby tests positive for HIV in two tests, then he's considered HIV positive.Because HIV can be passed on through breast milk, formula feeding is the only surefire way for a baby to remain HIV negative after birth.Even if a baby is born HIV negative, he'll have HIV antibodies from when he was in the womb. Antibodies are made by the immune system in response to an infection. Having HIV antibodies is not the same as having the virus.It can take up to 24 months for the antibodies to clear from your child's blood, so he may have one final test to confirm that his status is HIV negative.What other care does my baby need?Your baby will have a comprehensive physical exam soon after birth. Being HIV positive puts you at risk of other infections, and some of these could also spread to your baby. Depending on your health, your provider may test your baby for conditions including herpes, hepatitis B and hepatitis C, syphilis, toxoplasmosis, or tuberculosis.What happens if my baby is HIV positive?If your baby is HIV positive, a pediatric HIV specialist will start her on antiretroviral therapy (ART) immediately.The doctor will explain your baby's ART regimen to you and advise you how to give it daily. The medications need to be given exactly as directed to suppress the virus and prevent it from developing resistance to the drugs.If your baby has HIV (or even when her diagnosis is uncertain), she'll receive another medication when she's about 6 weeks old to protect her from a serious illness called pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP). This condition is an opportunistic infection. These sorts of infections mainly affect people with weakened immune systems, especially those with HIV, who are more at risk of being harmed by germs that are normally harmless.Following a medication schedule can be difficult with a new baby. It's a busy and chaotic time to learn to care for a newborn. You'll have frequent follow-up visits with your healthcare provider, which give you the chance to talk about any problems or questions you have.Your baby will be carefully monitored to check that her condition improves and her immune system is responding well to treatment. Your provider will adjust your baby's drug regimen in response to his test results as she grows.If my baby is HIV positive, what does it mean for his future?It's devastating to find out that your baby is infected with a condition as serious as HIV. But treatments for HIV are so effective at eliminating most of the virus from the blood that the immune system can work normally, giving most people with HIV a long life.Getting treatment early, before the disease has progressed, can mean it's possible to have a long and healthy life.Visit the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine's website for more information and to find an MFM specialist near you.Show sources Hide sources ACOG. 2012.

It's also a great opportunity for cuddling, eye contact, and just being together.Moving and growing strongerWhat to expect: At birth, your baby is almost completely helpless and has little control over his own movements. Over time, he'll stop flailing and actually be able to grab something (a rattle, for instance), his neck will get stronger and he'll have more head control, and he'll start developing other physical skills.How you can help: Daily tummy time from the very beginning is hugely important for helping new babies develop their muscles so they can move in various ways, such as pushing up with their arms, raising their head, rolling in both directions, sitting up, crawling, and so on.Tummy time should happen only when your baby is awake.

Helping a child who's underweight,https://www.babycenter.com/0_helping-a-child-whos-underweight_64368.bc,"How can I tell if my preschooler is too skinny?There are several factors to take into consideration when evaluating your child's weight. Has he always been thin? Are both of his parents very thin? A child who has a genetic tendency to be thin is in a different boat than a child who has always been normal to hefty and who has recently stopped gaining  or started losing  weight. Even if your child has just recently thinned out, though, there may be nothing to worry about.""Keep in mind that a child's weight is dynamic and changes with growth,"" says Stephen R. Daniels, M.D., Ph.D., a professor of pediatrics at Children's Hospital Medical Center in Cincinnati and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition.When an increase in height precedes a gain in weight, Daniels explains, your child may appear underweight for a while, until his weight gain catches up. It's also possible, though, for your child's weight gain to eventually outstrip his gain in height, resulting in his becoming overweight. Doctors are very concerned that many children are becoming overweight as they grow older, Daniels says, and some of those children started out as underweight.The best way to determine whether your child is underweight  and to find out what to do about it  is to make an appointment with his doctor so she can help you evaluate his weight and his diet. How will the doctor determine whether my child is underweight?Your child's doctor will take into consideration the factors mentioned above  how much his parents weigh and how long he's been thin. She'll also evaluate your child's eating habits and his overall health. She'll probably ask if your child has had any medical problems that may have contributed to weight loss, like chronic diarrhea or vomiting.The doctor will measure your child's height and weight and plot these numbers on a growth chart. Doctors today are using a new series of growth charts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that take into consideration a child's body mass index, or BMI, which considers weight together with height to help determine whether they are proportional. The BMI is a better indicator of body composition than a weight measurement alone. While an adult's BMI is calculated with a straight formula of height and weight, the formula to determine a child's BMI takes into consideration gender and age as well, to allow for the fact that body composition changes as a child gets older.If your child's BMI falls below the 5th percentile, he's considered underweight. The doctor will ask you questions about your child's diet, so she can pinpoint any major deficiencies. She may have you refer to the Food Guide Pyramid, so you can determine which food groups your child may not be getting enough of. She'll do a physical examination and may run laboratory tests to determine if there's an underlying medical cause, especially if your child seems to be eating well but not gaining weight. How can I help my child gain weight?Assuming your child has no underlying medical concerns, the idea will be to get him to take in more calories. For some children, simply adding foods that are ""heart-healthy"" sources of fat such as avocados, nuts, and vegetable oils  provides enough additional calories to meet the demands of growth. Try to plan healthy, calorie-dense meals and snacks for your child so he gets enough to eat.Whatever you do, don't feed your child ""junk food"" in an effort to promote weight gain, warns Daniels. Eating habits are ingrained early in life, and they may be difficult to change once they become established.Make mealtimes pleasant and unrushed. Sit down together whenever you can and enjoy your food and time together. Involve your child in meal planning, shopping (enlist his help picking out fruit at the market and bread at the bakery, for example), and food preparation, to encourage his interest in food and eating. Also, don't let your child get so wrapped up doing something that he skips meals. He needs to be eating frequently if you want him to gain weight.Here is a list of healthy high-calorie foods that you might offer your child:Dairy: Whole milk, cheese, cottage cheese, yogurt, ice cream, creamed soups, puddingProtein: Eggs, peanut butter, bean soups, nutsCarbohydrates: Bread, macaroni and cheese, pasta, French toast, pancakes, mashed potatoes, hot cerealIf your child is a picky eater and refuses to add new foods to his diet, his doctor may recommend a high-calorie supplement drink. These supplements taste like milkshakes and provide additional vitamins and minerals that your child may be missing out on.Make sure, though, that your child isn't filling up on beverages  like juices or even milk  so that he's not hungry for meals. Try to limit juice to no more than one cup a day and milk to no more than two cups a day.While you'll be eager to check on his progress, don't start subjecting your child to regular weigh-ins at home, because they may make him anxious and self-conscious about his weight. However, your doctor may want to see your child once a month to monitor his progress. Treat these visits like any other to the doctor, and don't make a big deal about the weigh-in process.What if my child doesn't start gaining weight?If your child is getting enough calories but still does not seem to be gaining weight appropriately, continue to work with his doctor to discover any underlying conditions. On the other hand, if your child is refusing to eat, there may be a psychological reason that you'll want to discuss with a child therapist. Your child's doctor can provide a referral.Chances are good, though, that with some patience and some conscientious meal and snack plans, your child will strike a good height/weight balance."
Colic: How to cope,https://www.babycenter.com/0_colic-how-to-cope_1369745.bc,"I think my baby has colic. What can I do?If your otherwise healthy baby cries for more than three hours in a row, on three or more days a week, for at least three weeks, then it's probably colic. (Yes, that's a lot of crying.) Colic peaks around six weeks, and then tapers off to an hour or two of crying by the time your baby is 3 or 4 months old.Babies with colic can have lengthy bouts of crying at any time during the day, and sometimes their crying gets worse in the evening. It can be rough on parents, who are desperate to soothe their baby but have a hard time finding anything that works.It's a good idea to check with your baby's healthcare provider first to rule out any medical condition that could be causing your baby's crying. If your baby is healthy, and colic is indeed the problem, try the tips below for soothing your baby. Your baby's doctor might have some suggestions too.Try a gentle massageYour baby might enjoy a gentle massage, but be sensitive to how she responds. She may feel overstimulated. (Chiropractic care has not been proven helpful with colic.)Make some noiseBabies like sounds that remind them of the rhythmic heartbeat and gentle whooshing noises they heard in the womb. Your baby might find it comforting to sit in his infant seat near the clothes dryer as it's running or snuggle in a front carrier while you vacuum. Or he might calm down when the exhaust fan is on in the kitchen.You can also search online for soothing sounds like rainfall or other constant, natural noise.HushSome babies are comforted by motion, noise, and activity, but others need less stimulation and respond better to quiet, stillness, and darkness.Move itGentle motion can be soothing, so try rocking your baby. You can put her in a baby swing, but if your baby falls asleep in the swing, it's safest to move her to a crib.It might be easier for your baby to settle if you walk around the house carrying her in a front carrier or sling. She may prefer being held higher in the pack, close to your chest and your heartbeat. Or try gently bouncing up and down in this position while hugging your baby close.Hit the roadIf you've been indoors, it may help to take your baby for a walk in a stroller, sling, or front carrier. The new sights, sounds, and smells may distract her, and the fresh air and rhythmic movement of walking may calm her enough to fall asleep.On the other hand, if you've been out and about with your baby all morning, some quiet time at home might be just what she needs.Try a different positionYour baby might be most comfortable cradled in your arms, or he might prefer a more upright position, or even lying tummy-down across your lap. Try different positions when he's upset to see if he seems to prefer one position over another.SwaddleThink about how snug your baby was before her birth, and you'll have a good idea how wide the world seems to her right now. Swaddling  wrapping your infant snugly in a blanket or cloth  can help a baby feel less out of control. You can try swaddling your baby during feedings if she has trouble settling down enough to eat, or wrap her up before her usual colicky period or before you put her down to sleep.Not only might swaddling help your colicky baby get to sleep, there's a good chance it will help her stay asleep, too.Researchers have found that babies who are swaddled sleep more soundly than those who aren't. That's because when a baby twitches during sleep, her own movements can wake her up. Swaddling keeps that little twitch from becoming a full-fledged flail she's unlikely to sleep through.It's best to keep your swaddled baby where you can keep an eye on her to make sure she doesn't roll onto her stomach and wind up face down on the mattress. To reduce this risk, stop swaddling your baby when she's about 2 months old (or is able to roll over).Bathe your babyA warm bath in the middle of your baby's colic time might distract and relax him. Some babies are soothed by the spray of a handheld nozzle on their back. Your baby may enjoy the rhythmic pulsing of the warm water as well as the sound.Offer a pacifierAnything that helps your baby calm down is a lifesaver right now. For some babies, sucking is the ultimate soother. Consider offering her a pacifier, or encourage your baby to suck on her finger by gently putting it in her mouth.Ease a gassy tummyGas doesn't cause colic, but some colicky babies also suffer from gassiness because they tend to swallow air while crying. Keep your baby upright during feedings, and burp him often to try to ease gas pain.Use a (warm) hot water bottleSome babies enjoy the feeling of warm water against their belly. Fill a hot water bottle with lukewarm water and wrap it in a towel. (Don't make the water too hot  what feels warm to you might be too hot for your baby.) Place it on your belly and let your baby lie on top of you.Try probioticsStudies have shown that babies with colic have different gut bacteria than babies who don't have colic. Probiotics helped reduce colic symptoms in some of these babies, though the American Academy of Pediatrics says it's too early to know whether probiotics work well enough to use for all colicky babies. If you'd like to give probiotics a try, ask your provider to recommend a probiotic for your baby.Is it possible my baby can't tolerate certain foods?Another cause of tummy trouble that mimics (but doesn't cause) colic is an intolerance or an allergy to cow's milk protein or other food. If you think that might be causing your baby problems, here are some things to try:Adjust your diet if you're breastfeedingIf you think your baby may be sensitive to something in your breast milk, talk to your healthcare provider. It may help to eliminate all dairy products for a couple weeks. (That's how long it takes for the cow's milk protein to be cleared from your milk.)If that doesn't do the trick, consider taking a look at foods other than dairy products. There's plenty of controversy about which ones are problematic (and the data is conflicting), but potential suspects include caffeine, wheat, eggs, nuts, onions, and cabbage.Take a break from eating likely offenders for a few days to see if you can identify any troublesome foods that might be making your baby uncomfortable. Reintroduce them one at a time, waiting to see if your baby reacts to one item before adding another. The process takes a while, but it might save your baby some crying time.Ask about a formula changeAgain, formula doesn't cause colic, but switching kinds may be worth a try if your baby is crying excessively. Ask your baby's doctor about switching to a formula that has partially or extensively hydrolyzed cow's milk protein. Are there any medicines or supplements that ease colic?Other than probiotics (mentioned above), you can try gripe water or antigas (simethicone/mylicon) drops sold over-the-counter. Neither one has been proven effective, but they are commonly used for gas pain in babies and are generally considered safe.Don't give your baby any of these in an effort to calm her down:Infant cereal or other solid foods. Your baby isn't ready to digest solid food, and giving them to her won't help her feel better.Medications such as antispasmodics or antihistamines. These can be unsafe for your baby.Herbal teas or supplements. Some studies show that certain herbs can relieve colic, but they can also be unsafe because the strength, dosage, and quality of the herbs can't be guaranteed. That's why many experts advise against giving herbs to your baby, while others recommend that you only do so under the guidance of your baby's doctor.Talk with your doctor before giving your baby anything other than breast milk or formula.How to keep your sanityAn inconsolable baby is a tough trial for a new parent. It's enough to make you cry. Go ahead. Also keep in mind:It's not personalWhen your baby rejects your attempts to console her or seems angry with you, remind yourself that she's too young to comprehend the concept of blame. And while there are ways to try to console her, colic has nothing to do with your parenting skills.You can't do it aloneShare baby care with your partner. Have a friend or relative take over for you once in a while so you can take a peaceful walk or a refreshing shower.If you find yourself becoming angry or frustrated with your baby, take a deep breath and gently lay her in her crib. Then call a friend or a relative to come and stay with your baby while you calm down.If there's nobody you can call to come and support you in person, contact a local crisis hotline or a child abuse hotline. The people who staff these phones know how to help.You're helping your baby, even if she's still cryingYou may not be able to keep your baby from crying. In fact, it's possible that crying is exactly what she needs to do, and you can best help her by respecting and accepting that. Continue to hold her, rock her, whisper to her  and let her cry, all the while assured of your love.Learn more:Best tricks for soothing a crying babyWhat I wish I'd known about soothing a fussy baby12 reasons babies cry and how to soothe them5 tips for soothing a colicky baby Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:43Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:43Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Parents Say: Ways to save time and make life with a baby easier,https://www.babycenter.com/0_parents-say-ways-to-save-time-and-make-life-with-a-baby-easi_1397713.bc,"After your new baby arrives, feelings of joy go head-to-head with heavy eyelids, drained energy, and fragile emotions. Fortunately, there are plenty of crafty ways to save time and make daily life run more smoothly when you're caring for a baby.These tips gathered from BabyCenter moms and dads are designed to reduce stress, save time and money, and help you stay in touch with the joy of raising your child.Feeding your babyBreastfeeding""A breastfeeding station is a must. Mine has a glider, a snap-on light, water, burp cloths, the TV remote, and my tablet fully loaded with movies, shows, and stuff to read."" Jennifer""I take so many, many pictures of my baby  it's overwhelming if I don't keep it under control. Breastfeeding is one time I can really look through the photos on my phone, delete the ones I don't need to keep, enjoy the great ones, share them with family, etc.""Caroline""One of our best investments was a bedside sleeper. I don't have to get out of bed for night feedings  I just reach over and pull my baby to me. When she's done, I edge her back to her bed. Neither of us has to fully wake up, which makes getting back to sleep much easier."" SallyPumping""I bought microwaveable bags to sterilize breast pump parts, bottles, and nipples. I rinse items as I use them, put them in the bag, and microwave the bag when it's full."" Suzanne""Pump milk from one side while nursing on the other."" Melissa""One of my best discoveries is a hands-free pumping bra. I can pump while reading the newspaper and eating breakfast."" EdyFormula and bottles""Buy a 30- to 60-ounce plastic pitcher and mix up 30 or more ounces of formula at once. It's good for 24 hours once mixed (refrigerated), and it saves you from having to mix the powdered formula with water for each feeding."" Julie""I have a small [dorm] refrigerator in the twins' room where I store the evening and morning bottles. I have a bottle warmer too, so we can easily feed them in their room without having to run downstairs."" Brian and KatieOnce your baby's started solids""I prepare a week's worth of baby cereal at a time, measuring out the right amount of dry cereal in individual bowls or cups with lids. Then all I need to do is add [breast] milk or formula."" Paula""Make batches of baby food, like steamed and mashed veggies and fruits, at one time and freeze them in meal-size quantities in small zippered bags. Defrost the bags in the fridge."" Virginia""I keep finger foods in snack-size zippered bags so I can grab a few whenever we leave the house."" MaggieTips to use at homeBath time""I've been taking showers with my daughter ever since she could hold her head up! We didn't have the bathtub option so this was a great way to save time. I don't get any alone time in showers anymore, but it's a time for us to have no distractions and just be silly."" A BabyCenter member""When my daughter was an infant, she hated bath time. I read somewhere that a mom took her kids in the shower, and I figured I'd give it a shot. But since babies are slippery I wore thin snow gloves to keep hold of her. They doubled as a rag to lather her up with soap. I was also breastfeeding then and had letdown issues. The warm water helped relax me enough for her to eat, and an added bonus is I got to take a shower too!"" A BabyCenter memberTidying up""I love to use the laundry basket to clean things up. I also use plastic bags to sort stuff right when I pick them up. For instance, I have four bags in my laundry basket: I put trash in one, kitchen stuff in another, clothes in one, and toys in another. Then I just put the bags in the respective rooms and tackle them when I get around to cleaning that room!"" A BabyCenter member""To get cleaning done while my 7-month-old son is awake, I try to make all my chores a game to involve him more, even if it just means singing my way through washing dishes. I keep a few toys in every room and bring him with me while I clean. Bringing him from room to room with me means I can keep an eye on him, and the change of scenery keeps him from getting bored. He has new places to explore, and he naps better because he wears himself out playing and not crying. Cleaning while he's awake means that while he's napping I can give myself a break too. Otherwise I'd be going nonstop and I would be exhausted by the end of the day!"" A BabyCenter member""Babyproof! And build a baby 'jail.' Mine started crawling at 6 1/2 months and walking at 9 1/2 months. I had a totally padded, babyproofed section of my living room gated off so I could go to the bathroom sometimes."" A BabyCenter member""With my first, I was told to sleep when baby sleeps.But then how do you get stuff done? You set an alarm for 20 minutes, pick one thing each time the baby is sleeping and do that for 20 minutes, then rest. It might take you all day to get just a couple of things done, but they get done and you get the rest you need."" A BabyCenter member""Use puppy pads as makeshift changing tables or use them to line not-so-clean changing tables at gas stations, public restrooms etc. I use them all the time, and they're awesome!"" A BabyCenter member""Puppy training pads! From 'airing out' to midnight diaper changes, these are amazing to protect carpets, sheets, and anything else. I used them with every diaper change while they were very young because little bums are full of surprises!"" A BabyCenter memberLaundry""Keep separate laundry bins or baskets for sorting laundry. It is easier to have a 'baby bin' for washing [clothes] with baby soap, a 'whites bin' for clothes to be washed with bleach, etc. That saves a ton of time when you do laundry."" A BabyCenter member""I never bothered with special baby detergents when washing baby clothes. We bought [regular detergent without] perfumes or dyes. I figured that would work best with my baby's sensitive skin, plus we could do our own laundry in it, so no need for separate detergents. Sure made laundry simpler!"" A BabyCenter member""Use a lingerie bag for socks, mittens, headbands, and other tiny items so they don't get lost in the wash."" A BabyCenter memberTips for heading out with your baby""I always leave a seasonally appropriate change of clothes in the trunk, with a diaper (now underwear) and socks, inside a plastic baggie, so I always have something in case of emergency. And the baggie is also so I have a place to store clothes that get puked on/pooped on/peed on/bird crapped on."" A BabyCenter member""Put a couple of diapers in your purse that you can have on you at all times. I also stash small packs of wipes in different places, so I will have them ready for dirty hands and diaper changes."" A BabyCenter member""Customer service [desks] often have wipes and diapers on hand for 'mishaps'! I didn't know this until one day at Costco I was stuck pondering [whether I should] wash my sons bottom in the bathroom sink after running out of wipes when a helpful lady ran to the customer service counter for some more. Turns out it's a service that most stores provide  super comforting to know!"" A BabyCenter memberGoing back to work""I outsource a lot. We have a cleaning person two times per month, and I order groceries for delivery. I also have simplified everything. Dinners are very basic and usually only require one pot or baking dish. I rotate through the same 10 meals. I also do all laundry on the weekend and prep all lunches and outfits. This really maximizes my time during the week and gives me more time with my little one at night."" A BabyCenter member""I take the 'do more during the week to maximize the weekend' approach. I make dinners [in the slow cooker] Tuesday through Thursday, and every meal is prepared so that we have enough leftovers for lunch the next day. I label and pack lunch the night before, and I do two loads of laundry per day. As soon as I walk through the door, I start a load. I put that in the dryer while eating dinner. I then put another load in the machine. Right before bed, I put the second load in the dryer. If it's really crazy, I can get another load done before I leave the house in the morning. Folding clothes and [cleaning] bathrooms are the only chores I do on weekends."" A BabyCenter member""I bake a crustless quiche for breakfast on Monday that lasts four mornings for me and my husband. My son eats cereal or yogurt. I pack everyone's lunch while my husband is cleaning the kitchen after dinner. I put oatmeal in the slow cooker for breakfast as well."" A BabyCenter member""I grocery shop on Fridays after work, so it doesn't bleed into the weekend. It's tough, but scheduling and staying focused helps a lot."" A BabyCenter member""If you are pumping, get the pumping schedule as close as possible to your planned pumping time at work. If you're planning to pump during your morning commute, lunch, and drive home, start to adjust to these times now. You might see some drops in production if you make a sudden change, but if you empty out every time, your body will start to respond and rebuild production for these times quickly.""  A BabyCenter member""It's so hard to go backto work at the beginning. As crazy as it sounds,I would do a couple of trial runs as if you were getting yourself and your babyout the door. It can be overwhelming at first juggling it all, and it usually takes longer than you think, especially the first few days. So get up and get yourself and your baby ready as if it was a work day. (And then you'll be all ready to start the day and do something fun!)"" A BabyCenter memberKeep it in perspectiveMy tip: Hold your baby. Take that time. Smile at this little beautiful creation that has made you fall so deeply in love. In your last breath you will never say, 'I shouldn't have held my kids that much!' It goes by fast...hold on."" A BabyCenter member""Keep a journal of the little moments or you'll forget them."" A BabyCenter member""On the sanity front, you can't do it all, and you can't do it perfectly! Learn to be okay with that."" A BabyCenter member"

Research confirms what we've known all along: Love, attention, and basic care are what your baby needs and wants. To help your baby reach his full potential, follow these simple steps.1. Shower your baby with love and attentionScientific evidence shows that love, attention, and affection in the first years of life have a direct and measurable impact on a child's physical, mental, and emotional growth. Experts say love and touch also help your baby's brain develop.How do you show your love? Hug, touch, smile, encourage, listen to, and play with your little one often.It's also important to answer his cries, especially in the first six months or so, when experts say it'simpossible to spoil a child. Tend to your baby's physical needs right away, and be sensitive to things like whether he's too warm or could be uncomfortable from a wet diaper.Responding to your baby when he's upset (as well as when he's happy) builds trust and a strong emotional bond, according toZero to Three, a nonprofit organization dedicated to improving the lives of infants, toddlers, and families.How to hold a crying baby Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:51Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:51Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Take care of the basicsA baby needs to be healthy so she can learn and grow. Take your baby to regular checkups, and keep herimmunizationsup to date.Sleepis important for your baby too, so help her get plenty of shut-eye. Your baby's brain cells make important connections during sleep, which help with learning, movement, and thought. These connections help your baby understand what she sees, hears, tastes, touches, and smells as she explores the world.Breast milk and formula provide all the nutrients your baby needs for the first six months and make up a large part of her diet until at least her first birthday. Studies show that breastfed babies have lower rates of allergies, diarrhea, respiratory problems, obesity, and ear infections. But if you're unable to breastfeed (or choose not to), your baby can thrive onformulaas well.3.Talk to your babyResearch shows that children whose parents speak to them extensively as babies develop more advanced language skills than children who don't receive much verbal stimulation. (You can even begin during your pregnancy  it's a great way to start bonding.)Talk to your baby as you diaper, feed, and bathe him. He'll respond better if he knows the words are directed at him, so try to look at him while you're speaking. Don't worry about saying anything profound. Just describe what you're doing: ""Daddy is putting warm water in the tub so he can clean you up.""Parents naturally use baby talk, speaking in simplified sentences and phrases with a high-pitched voice. Experts say this helps young babies learn language, but use a regular voice as your child gets older so he develops goodlanguage skills.4. Read to your babyMake a point ofreading to your childfrom day one. Reading aloud is one of the most important things you can do to build your child's vocabulary, stimulate her imagination, and improve her language and social skills. It's also just a good reason to cuddle your baby!Choose print books for babies because they may find the animations and audio effects in digital books and story apps very distracting.5. Stimulate your baby's sensesYour child needs to be exposed to different people, places, and things to learn about them. Every new interaction gives him information about the world and his place in it. Even the simplest daily activities can stimulate your baby's development.Play interactive games (such as peekaboo and patty-cake), go on walks and shopping trips together, and let your baby meet new people.Choose toys and objects with different shapes, textures, colors, sounds, and weights.Put on your favorite music during playtime, or sing treasured lullabies when you put your baby to sleep.Provide safe spaces where your baby can crawl, cruise, and eventually walk without constantly hearing ""no"" or ""don't touch."" For example, put childproof locks on all the cabinets in the kitchen except one. Fill that cabinet with plastic bowls, measuring cups, wooden spoons, and pots and pans that your baby can play with safely.If your baby lights up when he sees Grandma's face on Skype, let him practice his conversation skills over a video chat.Children can be overstimulated easily, so don't feel like you have to interact with your child 24 hours a day or try to engage all his senses at once. Also, doctors discourage TV or screen timefor babies and toddlers younger than 18 months  and that includes having the TV on in the background.Let's Play: Weekly Baby ActivitiesFind two perfect, development-boosting activities for every week of your baby's first year.6. Challenge your babyWhen an activity doesn't come easily to your baby, she has to figure out a new way to accomplish the task. Don't frustrate your child with toys or activities that are beyond her abilities, but give her opportunities to stretch a little so she masters new skills.If she's attempting to open a box, for example, resist the urge to do it for her. Let her try first. If she continues to struggle, show her how it's done, then give her back a closed box so she can try again on her own.7. Take care of yourselfThere's truth in the saying that a happy parent makes for a happy baby, so be sure to take care of yourself. Get someexercise every day (even if it's just going for a walk with your baby in his stroller), eathealthy foods, and squeeze in naps so you're getting enough rest.Find ways to share the household and parenting responsibilities with your partner, and if you're a single parent, surround yourself with people who can help and support you.And don't forget to take some time for yourself. Being a parent  especially an involved and active one  is tiring, and you need time to recharge.If you're overwhelmed caring for your baby or you're feeling down, find someone you trust to talk to. Most women experience the baby blues after childbirth, but you could be depressed if: You feel intense sadness or anxiety.You're not able to care for yourself or your baby.You no longer enjoy the things you usually do.Any of these situations warrant a talk with your healthcare provider and an evaluation to determine whether you have postpartum depression.8. Find good childcareIf you work outside the home or need a babysitter regularly,a quality childcare provideris essential to your baby's healthy development. Whether your childcare provider is a nanny, a relative, or a daycare worker, she should be experienced, caring, and reputable, with a genuine love for children and the energy to help your baby thrive.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015.

Hiking with your child,https://www.babycenter.com/0_hiking-with-your-child_8256.bc,"As much as you love your little one, being cooped up in the house all the time can lead to a pretty severe case of cabin fever. Consider exploring the great outdoors with your child  and we don't mean your backyard. Many parents discover that hitting the hiking trail is the perfect tonic for parenting stress.How to find tot-friendly trailsThe best way to research good places for family hikes is to ask other parents where they like to go. You can also check online or call your county's or state's parks department to get information on open space and marked trails that are suitable for children.The Sierra Club has a database to help find trails near you. Day-hiking guides from the bookstore or library can also steer you in the right direction. Online message boards or email trees for parents and hiking enthusiasts are other ways to find family-friendly trails.But to some extent, you really won't know whether a hike is child-friendly or interesting for you until you get there. Be prepared to hit and miss  and realize that sometimes the misses will be as fun (at least in retrospect) as the hits.Hiking tipsTry a dry run without your child. Familiarize yourself with the trail, find out what the terrain is really like, and get an idea of how long the hike will actually take. If your favorite places have lots of water, you might discover you have to go inland to seek out little creeks and swimming holes. Others might choose a particular trail based on the proximity of restrooms and air-conditioned restaurants.Choose a trail that's the right distance and terrain for your youngest hiker. Nothing spoils an outdoor trek more quickly than an unhappy hiker. Whether you're taking a group of children or going with just one, be sure the youngest will enjoy the hike as much as the oldest.Go early. You want your child to have his batteries fully charged when you hit the trail. If you're at the trailhead at 9 a.m., you can work your muscles, soak up all the good eco-vibes, and be home by noon  perfect timing for lunch and a nap. With an older child who can hike longer distances, starting early will still get you back to your car before the sun starts to set.Plan rest stops. Children tire easily, so plan to stop and explore more often than not. Choose a spot about halfway through to rest and refuel with snacks and water. Set goals. Sometimes a waterfall, lake, or beautiful vista at the top of a trail is an exciting goal to hike toward. Just remember your child will likely be more energized by the journey than the destination, so be flexible and prepared to let go of goals if your child gets sidetracked.Make it fun for everyone. Think of educational and fun activities to do along the way that will keep your child entertained. Learn to identify some of the local trees and flowers so you can point them out to your child as you wander. Singing, playing games, and telling stories will also keep children interested and make the experience enjoyable for everyone.How far your child can hikeThat depends on how old your child is and whether you carry her, push her, or let her walk by herself  and how energetic you both feel that day.Here's a closer look at appropriate hiking distances for different ages:Newborns: Don't even think about going on a hike if your baby is less than 1 month old. (You may even want to wait a couple of extra weeks to give yourself time to fully recover from the birth of your baby.) Babies this age are just too young to be exposed to the sun, the possibility of bad weather, and the jostling that comes from walking on rough terrain.1- to 5-month-olds: How long a hike you can take depends on your stamina and your baby's. A front carrier is a good idea for babies this age for head and neck support. An infant, especially one not used to the confinement of a front carrier, may get fussy after just a short while. Older babies may be content for more than an hour before the cranky, hungry, and wet diaper factors set in.6- to 14-month-olds: The key here is a good back carrier. It's safe to start using one when your child is able to sit up on her own  usually when she weighs at least 15 pounds and is 6 months old. If you're well rested, your baby is comfortable, the weather is temperate, and you pack enough supplies (snacks, drinks, and diapers), you may last several hours if you take a few breaks.14 months to 4 years: Once your child starts walking with some confidence, adjust your expectations. You can still put her in a back carrier if you've invested in a good one with a wide age and weight range (up to 60 pounds). But toddlers like to get out periodically to walk by themselves. That will slow you to a snail's pace as they look at this leaf over here, and that puddle over there. Given ample water and snacks, 2- to 4-year-olds can usually hike a mile or so in good weather if the terrain is safe and predictable and you take breaks. But be aware, you'll probably end up carrying your child at times, especially on the way home. What to bring with youMost wooded areas have a few hazards: Poison ivy or oak, tricky topography, ticks, mosquitoes and snakes, and of course, the sun. You can avoid most of them with good preparation. What to bring:Snacks and drinks: For kids 1 to 24 months old, bring breast milk or formula (or cow's milk if they're at least a year old). Bring a bottle of water for each hiker, too. (Kids can get dehydrated even if they're only passengers.) Keep milk and formula cool in a collapsible insulated tote bag or small cooler.For 2- to 4-year-olds, bring a variety of snacks (peanut butter and whole grain cracker squares, low-sugar granola bars, O-shaped toasted oat cereal, dried or fresh fruit), water in squirt bottles, and 100 percent juice packs.Gear: Pack a blanket or sheet to sprawl on, a lightweight first-aid kit, a fully-charged cell phone in case of an emergency, a GPS, and, if you have a curious toddler, a shovel and small coffee can or plastic bowl with a lid to gather treasures.The right clothes: Dress your child in long cotton pants, a long-sleeved T-shirt, and a wide-brimmed hat. This outfit will keep him cool, comfortable, and protected from the sun and ticks. Sturdy hiking shoes or sneakers and socks are better than open-toed sandals or rubber shoes. Bring a spare T-shirt and extra layers in case it gets chilly. And don't forget a diaper or two.Sunscreen and bug repellent: Keep babies younger than 6 months out of direct sunlight as much as possible. If the sun is unavoidable, sunscreen is safe  in small amounts  for babies under 6 months. Bug repellent isn't recommended for children younger than 2 months, so it's best to keep your infant covered with clothes and a hat.If your baby is older than 2 months, sunscreen and bug repellent can be useful as long as you don't get them in his eyes (and avoid putting repellent on your child's hands). But don't rely on them too heavily  clothing is still the best protection against bites and burns.When choosing a bug repellant, look for products designed for children. Avoid anything that contains both sunscreen and insect repellent, or has more than 30 percent of the chemical DEET. (Check the label to be sure.) Products containing DEET are linked to certain health problems. The right attitudeMellow is the name of the game. Hiking only a few hundred yards while investigating the flora and fauna can make for a great trip. Overachieving can lead to overtiredness, probably your greatest adversary on a day hike.Infants in carriers are self-regulating; they sleep when they're tired. But toddlers are another story: If they get tired, bored, or grumpy, time to head for home.Your time on the trail can be a fine adventure if you bring digging and collecting equipment for the many treasures that you'll find along the way  roly-poly bugs, sticks, and rare pebbles. Prime your child the night before with bedtime stories of hiking and being in the woods.When you're out on the trail, encourage your little hiker with abundant praise, and remember to enjoy the fresh air and the unforgettable bonding experience you're having."
Feeding problems: Anemia,https://www.babycenter.com/0_feeding-problems-anemia_9205.bc,"What is anemia?When young children develop anemia, the usual cause is a lack of dietary iron. This mineral nourishes the body's red blood cells so they can create hemoglobin, which helps carry oxygen throughout the body.Babies are born with a store of iron that usually lasts up to six months. It's not unusual for children between 4 and 6 months of age to develop mild anemia as their body's supply of iron becomes depleted. Feeding your baby breast milk or iron-fortified formula helps replenish this supply.Also, anemia can develop around 6 months of age when babies start solids and drink less formula or breast milk. Babies born prematurely and exclusively breastfed infants may deplete their stores of iron earlier even earlier.Signs of anemiaSigns of anemia are often subtle. More often than not, your child won't have any symptoms at all. When they do occur, symptoms may include:Looking paleHaving fingernails lacking in colorHaving low energyWhat you can doYour pediatrician checks for anemia during regular checkups and may test hemoglobin levels with a blood sample between 9 and 12 months.If anemia is confirmed, you may need to start giving your child iron-rich foods, such as red meats, fortified cereals, and beans. It's also important to serve foods rich in vitamin C, such as orange juice, because they enhance iron absorption. (Don't give juice to babies younger than 6 months and limit the amount of juice your baby drinks to no more than 1/2 a cup daily.)Iron supplements also help. The American Academy of Pediatrics even recommends giving strictly breastfed babies iron supplements after 4 months as a preventive measure until they start eating iron-rich solid foods. But check with your child's doctor first because regular use of iron supplements can cause stomach upset.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2012. Anemia and your child.

Giving kids an allowance: What you need to know,https://www.babycenter.com/0_giving-kids-an-allowance-what-you-need-to-know_10304079.bc,"Why an allowance?To learn to ride a bike, you need a bike. And to learn to manage money, you need  a little money. By practicing with their own money, children get to try out concepts  saving for a rainy day, prioritizing goals, and delayed gratification  that might otherwise seem abstract or irrelevant.Allowances give kids room to make mistakes in a low-risk environment  sort of like learning to drive in an empty parking lot. If your 8-year-old can't go to the movies with a friend's family because he burned through all his allowance buying action figures, he may be more likely to plan ahead when he gets next week's allowance.Think of it this way: Teach your child the pitfalls of impulse buying early on, and he's less likely to arrive on your doorstep years from now with a duffel bag full of dirty laundry and a mountain of credit card debt.What's a good age to start?Around age 5 or 6 is typical. But some parents start in the preschool years, while others wait until age 10 or older. There's no magic starting time, says Kristan Leatherman, coauthor of Millionaire Babies or Bankrupt Brats? Love and Logic Solutions to Teaching Kids about Money. ""The best time is when your child begins to understand that money can buy him things he wants.""So if your child tends to shrug at money, losing it before it can find its way to his dusty piggy bank, hold off until you see signs that he enjoys saving it or thinking about how he might use it.How much is reasonable?Consider your family's financial resources, the cost of daily living in your area, and your own comfort level. ""I've seen it all over the place,"" says credit union market manager Mark Hodowanic. ""While there might be some general rules of thumb, its up to your family to decide what's best.""Many families like to use a formula corresponding to age, such as 50 cents or a dollar per week for each year of a child's life ($3.50 or $7 for a 7-year-old, $4 or $8 for an 8-year-old). A formula has certain advantages over a flat amount, says Leatherman. ""The kids get an automatic raise on their birthdays, so it takes away the question of when to increase the allowance,"" she explains. ""And it cuts out sibling arguments, because the younger kid can understand why the older kid gets more.""While many families give allowance weekly, others do it biweekly or monthly. The important thing is consistency. Set up a system to help you remember, so you have the right change and to avoid nagging reminders from your child. On the other hand, don't feel stuck  if your current arrangement simply isn't working, you can always sit down with your child and come up with a different plan.Do I get some say in what the allowance is spent on?""What if my kid wants to spend his allowance on fireworks or a pellet gun?"" you may be thinking. Don't worry  allowances can come with some oversight. But instead of making a list of banned items, Leatherman suggests setting up general guidelines like, ""You can spend your allowance however you like, as long as it doesn't cause a problem."" This gives you plenty of wiggle room. If your 6-year-old wants to buy a week's supply of cavity-causing sugar bunnies, simply cite the ""cause a problem"" clause.How can I teach my child to save and to share?You may want to let your child take charge of how much of his allowance to spend, how much to share, and how much to save. That's fine  he's sure to learn from his own successes and mistakes.Alternately, you can build in guidelines that reflect your values. You can require your child to save 10 percent of his allowance and donate another 10 percent to a charity he chooses. And you may want to divide the savings into ""fixed"" and ""revolving."" The fixed savings go directly into the bank, to be reserved for a long-term expense such as college or a car. The revolving savings remain at home with your child, for him to dip into at his discretion. Even if he depletes his stash on a regular basis, he'll still learn firsthand how helpful savings can be in a pinch.To encourage your child to make thoughtful decisions about money, consider forgoing the standard one-slotted piggy bank in favor of one with separate compartments. Examples are the Moonjar Moneybox and the Money Savvy Pig.Is it okay to let my child borrow against his allowance?""Mom, will you get me this toy?"" your child begs with puppy dog eyes. ""I'll promise I'll pay you back as soon as we get home."" What should you do? As long as you're comfortable with the toy and the price, making the short-term loan can be a good lesson for your child. But have some safeguards in place.""First, have your child sign the receipt,"" says Leatherman, in case he develops sudden amnesia about the agreement. ""And don't give him the toy until he gives you the money."" If upon arriving home, he discovers he doesn't have enough to pay for it, keep the toy until he earns or saves up the money. If the money never comes your way, feel free to get creative: The next time you hand over his allowance, include a ""bill"" for the toy.What about giving advances?Your child's best friend invites him to go to the movies, but he's already blown through his allowance. Should you give him next week's allowance early? ""If your child is generally responsible with money and you feel confident that he'll pay you back, it's fine to give him an advance,"" says Leatherman, though it's a good idea to have him sign an IOU.If you're not so sure, consider requesting collateral. ""Have your child give you a possession that's equal in value to the amount he's borrowing,"" Leatherman suggests. And make sure it's not some broken or long-forgotten toy  the collateral needs to be something he'll want back. Return the collateral when the next allowance time rolls around and he makes good on the loan.Of course, you can always just say no, especially if these advances are becoming an everyday occurrence. Your child may be disappointed about missing the movie, but he'll learn about the importance of building a ""rainy day"" fund.Is it smart to tie my child's allowance to chores?While many parents tie allowance to chores, Leatherman recommends against it. ""Depending on your child's mood, allowance may not be enough to motivate him,"" she says. In which case, you're stuck with undone chores.Also, when children get paid for chores, they don't fully experience what being a family member, a team member, is all about. It's important to teach them that all family members have responsibilities to the group. And that's nonnegotiable. Though they may gripe about doing the dishes, the need to contribute in a meaningful way is fundamental."
Stomach flu (gastroenteritis),https://www.babycenter.com/0_stomach-flu-gastroenteritis_1190017.bc,"What is stomach flu?Stomach flu, or gastroenteritis, is an inflammation of the lining of the digestive tract. Despite the name, it's not caused by the influenza virus. The most common culprit is one of a number of other viruses, including rotavirus, adenovirus, calicivirus, and astrovirus.But gastroenteritis can also be caused by a potentially more serious bacterial infection, such as Salmonella, Shigella, Staphylococcus, Campylobacter, or E. coli. Still other cases are caused by parasites such as giardia.If your baby has gastroenteritis, she may have diarrhea, vomiting, abdominal pain, fever, chills, and achiness. Her symptoms may be mild or severe, and they may last for just a few hours or for days, depending on the culprit.How did my baby get stomach flu?Viral gastroenteritis is very contagious. Your baby may have eaten something contaminated with the virus or shared a cup or utensils with someone who has the virus. (It's possible to have the virus without showing symptoms.)If bacteria or a parasite is to blame, your child may have ingested contaminated food or drinking water.Another way your baby may have picked up the illness is by coming in contact with infected fecal matter and then putting her hands in her mouth. This sounds gross, but it happens a lot, especially in daycare situations. Remember that germs are microscopic, so even when a child's hands don't look dirty, they may be covered with bacteria.Symptom CheckerUse our tool to find out what might be causing your child's symptoms.How common is stomach flu?Viral gastroenteritis is the second most common illness in the United States after upper respiratory infections such as colds. Most babies will come down with the stomach flu at least twice a year, more often if they're in daycare. Kids often enjoy a boost in their immunity after they turn 3 years old and may not contract it as often.When should I call my child's doctor?Give the doctor a call as soon as you suspect that your baby has gastroenteritis. Also call if your baby has been vomiting for more than two days or has blood in her stool, or you think she's excessively fussy.Use your doctor's guidelines for phoning in the event of a fever. (Common suggestions are fever of 100.4 degrees Fahrenheit if your baby's less than 3 months old; a fever of 101 degrees F if she's between 3 and 6 months old; and a fever of 103 degrees F or higher if she's 6 months or older.)Also call your doctor if your baby shows any of the classic signs of dehydration:decreased urination (more than six hours without a wet diaper)excessive sleepiness or fussinessa sunken soft spotwrinkled skinsunken eyesextreme thirstdry lipscrying without tearscool, discolored hands and feetIf your baby appears dehydrated and no doctor is available, take her to the emergency room.If your baby is in danger of dehydration, the doctor might recommend IV rehydration. He may want to admit her to the hospital or just keep her there for a few hours.If a blood or stool test reveals that your child has a parasitic or bacterial infection, she may also be given a course of antibiotics. Don't be alarmed. Odds are, she'll be released and back to her healthy self within a few days. How should I treat stomach flu?First, you'll want to call your baby's doctor and tell her what's going on, especially if your child is under 6 months.If your baby has a bacterial infection, the doctor may prescribe antibiotics. Medication won't be helpful for a case of viral gastroenteritis, though, which like all viral infections just has to run its course. Don't give your child anti-diarrhea medication  it'll just prolong her illness and can have potentially serious side effects.If your child has a fever and seems uncomfortable, ask your doctor about giving her the appropriate dose of infant acetaminophen or ibuprofen. Never give your child aspirin, which is associated with Reye's syndrome, a rare but potentially fatal illness.Dehydration is a concern whenever a child is losing fluid, whether it's through vomiting, diarrhea, or a fever.Depending on how much she's vomiting and whether she's able to keep down any liquids, the doctor may recommend giving her an over-the-counter oral electrolyte solution, such as Pedialyte, Rehydralyte, or Enfalyte. These solutions help replace lost fluids, minerals, and salts. The doctor can let you know how much your baby should be drinking based on her age and weight.If your child isn't able to keep down formula or breast milk, the doctor may advise you to give her small sips of the electrolyte solution throughout the day, until she's able to keep that down, and then slowly go back to her normal diet.While you're trying to keep your baby hydrated, stay away from high-sugar foods like juices, sodas, and Jell-O, which can make stomach flu symptoms worse. (Gastroenteritis can temporarily damage the lining of the small intestine, making it difficult to digest these sweet foods.)If your baby is eating solids and has a relatively mild case of gastroenteritis  say, mild diarrhea but no vomiting  she can continue to eat modest amounts throughout the course of her illness and probably won't require oral electrolyte solution. Breastfeeding or formula feeding should be enough to keep her hydrated. When can my baby go back to eating solids?Talk with the doctor and follow your baby's cues. She may be able to continue eating almost normally, or it may be better to keep her off solid foods for a couple of days.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children with gastroenteritis resume a normal diet (staying away from fatty foods) as soon as possible. That includes such staples as complex carbohydrates (whole-grain breads and cereals), lean meats, yogurt, fruits, and vegetables.Take note that this menu is different from the diet doctors used to prescribe. ""The BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, and toast) was once very commonly advocated, but we no longer recommend it because it lacks protein and other vital nutrients,"" says William John Cochran, associate professor of pediatrics at the Geisinger Clinic in Danville, Pennsylvania.Studies show that reintroducing a standard diet soon after acute symptoms ease can actually shorten a child's bout of gastroenteritis by half a day because it restores nutrients to the system that are necessary to fight infection. On the other hand, if the bug kills your baby's appetite and she misses a few days of good nutrition, don't worry. As long as she stays hydrated, she'll be fine.How can I help protect my baby against gastroenteritis?Wash your hands thoroughly with soap and warm water after every diaper change and bathroom visit and before preparing or eating food. The same goes for other family members and daycare staff. It's also a good idea to wash your baby's hands often throughout the day.What's more, be sure to follow safe food preparation and cooking practices.To prevent your child from getting rotavirus (which can cause diarrhea, vomiting, and fever, especially in babies and young children), your baby should receive three doses of the rotavirus vaccine: one at 2 months, another at 4 months, and the last at 6 months.Show sources Hide sources AAP.

Baby sleep training: Night weaning,https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-sleep-training-night-weaning_1505721.bc,"At what age will my baby be ready for night weaning?It's different for each baby. But somewhere between the ages of 4 and 6 months, most babies get enough calories during the day to sustain them for five or six hours at night.Even so, it's not at all unusual for younger babies to sleep for much longer stretches without needing to eat  or for older ones to continue waking up to eat.At the same time, your baby has other important needs. Few things are more satisfying and reassuring to a baby than being held and fed in a parent's arms.If you've recently gone back to work and are less available during the day, your baby may want to nurse or take a bottle at night as a way of reconnecting with you. And you may notice that your baby wakes up more often when he's teething, catches a cold, or is going through a developmental change.For all these reasons, it's important to approach the weaning process gradually and gently. Keep in mind that your baby is still young and has a tremendous need for comfort, closeness, and reassurance  particularly from you.How to hold a crying baby Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 1:51Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -1:51Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all baby videosHow do I know if my baby's ready?If your baby's at least 4 to 6 months old, you can probably begin to wean her from nighttime feedings. Of course, even if your baby doesn't need to eat in the middle of the night, she may still wake up wanting to. Babies who are used to eating several times a night tend to wake up out of habit, and it can take time to change this routine.It's hard to maintain your own health and well-being if you're chronically sleep deprived. So the decision to end to your baby's night feeding depends in part on how it's affecting you.If you enjoy nursing or giving a bottle to your baby at night, there's no reason to stop  she'll eventually quit on her own. On the other hand, if you find yourself feeling grumpy and exhausted  and your baby's physically ready for the change  maybe it's time.If you're not sure whether your baby's ready, talk to your child's doctor. The doctor can help you sort through all the issues and help you make your decision based on how your baby's growing.What the experts sayIn his book Solve Your Child's Sleep Problems, pediatrician Richard Ferber says unnecessary night feedings may actually cause sleep problems. According to Ferber, if a baby wakes up to eat several times during the night, a very wet diaper or digestive problems may cause him to wake up and then want to feed more, creating a vicious cycle.Pediatrician William Sears, on the other hand, emphasizes the benefits of night feedings for strengthening the bond between parent and child. Sears urges parents not to rush to night wean as long as the feedings aren't too disruptive to the family. In The Baby Sleep Book, Sears offers strategies like sleep-sharing and nursing while lying down to make night feedings easier for parents.In the end, as with all parenting decisions, you should do what's best for you and your family.Practical tips for night-weaning your babyStart the weaning process slowly and gradually. Nurse your baby for a shorter period of time on each breast or give her a smaller amount of milk in her bottle at night. Try to prolong the intervals between feedings by patting and comforting your baby back to sleep.Make sure your baby gets plenty to eat throughout the day. As your baby grows and becomes more active, she may not want to stop to nurse or take a bottle during the day, and she may try to make up for it at night. To make sure she gets enough to eat, take scheduled breaks during the day for a quiet bottle or nursing session in a place with no distractions. (If you're not sure that your child is eating enough, check her growth by having her weighed at the doctor's office.)Offer extra feedings in the evening. If she goes to bed with a full tummy, she's less likely to wake up hungry in the middle of the night. You may even want to wake her for a final feeding or ""dream feed"" before you go to bed yourself.Avoid night-weaning during times of transition. For example, if you're just about to return to work or take a family vacation. If you've recently become less available during the day, make sure to give your baby extra cuddle time when you're together, so she'll feel more connected and be less likely to seek comfort in the middle of the night.Have your partner comfort your baby when she cries at night. If you're the one caring for her at night, the smell of you or your breast milk is likely to make your baby want to feed. If you're sleep sharing, consider placing a bassinet on your partner's side of the bed instead.Gradually eliminate feedings, one at a time. Gently soothe and comfort your baby when she wakes to feed, and explain that it's time to sleep, not eat.Tell her she can nurse or have her bottle in the morning, but now it's time to sleep. Speak firmly and gently while patting her back or tummy  but don't pick her up. Even though she's too young to understand your words, she'll gradually understand the meaning, and your presence will be soothing.In many cases, babies cry only a little for a night or two before adapting to the new system.If you try to eliminate feedings and your baby cries inconsolably for several nights in a row, go back to your normal routine and try again in a week or two.Parents' voicesMy breastfed baby sleeps longer at night if I feed him more often in the evening. By bedtime he has a full tummy. His last feeding is at midnight, and he'll sleep up to six hours. I also noticed that once I cut out all caffeine from my diet and stopped eating sweets after 3 p.m., he started to sleep longer at night. LindaAt 6 months old, my son all of a sudden started his night waking again. I tried to resist feeding him, but as soon as I got him back to sleep and put him down he would start crying again. Then one night, when I could no longer take it, my husband went in and rocked him back to sleep and he didn't wake up again until morning. The next night I sent my husband in again and the same thing happened. I think my son associates me with his feedings so he expects me to feed him when I come to him in the middle of the night. JackieI've been breastfeeding my son since birth, but to get him to sleep longer at night, I give him a little formula at his last feeding. Instead of nursing, I pump. I have quite a supply built up in the freezer! The small amount of formula he's getting doesn't seem to affect our breastfeeding relationship, and the extra sleep is good for us both. DaniFollow your instincts when it comes to feeding in the middle of the night: If it feels right to you, continue. In America, we're so quick to make babies sleep alone. In other countries, babies stay with their mothers a lot longer. This time will go by so quickly, and eventually he won't be nursing at all, so enjoy it, day or night. OlivetI've had night-waking issues with all three of my breastfed babies but for different reasons. My oldest woke because of developmental milestones, my middle one woke purely to eat, and my youngest is 9 months and still not sleeping through the night because of separation anxiety. Every baby is unique and has different needs. There's no easy answer  just tune in to your child. Becky"

Baby products: Must-haves for the first year,https://www.babycenter.com/0_baby-products-must-haves-for-the-first-year_59.bc,"Products you need for your babyWhich baby products are essential for the first year? Look over our checklist of the most important things you'll need to clothe, transport, bathe, and feed your baby as well as give him a safe place to sleep and explore. You'll also find specific information about the supplies you need in the first six weeks and what to put on your baby registry too.If you want to go beyond the basics, we also have a list of product ""extras"" that can make the first year even easier.Baby clothesBaby clothes are usually sized by age, but this can vary among brands. For example, a 3- to 6-month bodysuit from one brand may be snug on your 4-month old, while the same size from another brand could be too big. Look for clothes that also list weight or height guidelines to help you find the ones that will fit your baby best.Some babies go straight to 3 months and never need newborn sizes, but that's hard to predict in advance, so it doesn't hurt to have some on hand. Also make sure you have a couple outfits in the next size up before your child actually needs it  babies grow quickly! Buying secondhand clothes and accepting hand-me-downs are a good way to make sure you'll always have the right size.Baby registry: Top 10 must-haves Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 2:46Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -2:46Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

Watch our countdown of the top 10 items. See all pregnancy videosFor everyday wear, think comfort and ease. Look for soft, roomy, durable clothing that enables your child to move and explore. Choose well-made items that will hold up through frequent washings. (Spit-up and grime take their toll.)Organic baby clothing is made without harsh dyes or potentially harmful chemicals, but it's usually more expensive. Whatever you choose, use a gentle, baby-friendly laundry detergent to prevent skin irritation.Here are the basics your baby will need for the first three months:One-piece outfits (5 to 7):Some of these are basically just jammies that are appropriate for both sleeping and playing. These are super convenient, especially at first, because babies nap so frequently. Look for ones that zip or snap down the front and all the way down the leg, so you can change your baby's clothes and diapers easily without pulling things over her head.Shirts and bodysuits (5 to 7): Choose ones with snaps at the neck (or a neckline that stretches) so they slip easily over your child's head.Leggings or stretchy pants (5 to 7): These make it easy to change one piece of dirty clothing without having to switch the whole outfit. An elastic waistband fits easily over your baby's diaper and belly  and expands as she gains weight.Outer layers (5): Zip-up sweaters, fleece jackets, and sweatshirts are easy to put on and take off. Many babies don't like pushing their head through a small neck opening.Buy larger sizes and look for items with loose armholes that won't require tugging and fussing. Hoods are helpful at this age because you can just slip one over your baby's head when the temperature is chilly.Avoid clothing that has dangling strings, tassels, and ribbons  these are choking hazards.Hats and mittens: A broad-brimmed sun hat for the summer and a warm hat that covers the ears in the winter should do the trick. Mittens for babies are shaped like bags with elastic at the wrist, making them easy to get on and off little hands.Socks or booties: You'll need lots of socks for indoors and booties or leather slippers to wear outside.Shoes: You may not need to buy real, hard-soled shoes during your baby's first year. Some experts recommend waiting until your child is a strong walker because shoes can interfere with development. Until then, cover her feet with socks or booties that have nonskid bottoms.When it comes time to buy sturdier footwear, go to a store that specializes in children's shoes. A salesperson can measure your child's feet, recommend an appropriate style or brand, and suggest the size that fits well and allows for growth.Pajamas or sleepers (5 to 7): When dressing your baby for bed, keep in mind three things: your baby's safety, her comfort, and how easily you'll be able to change the inevitable middle-of-the-night dirty diaper. No matter how cute it looks, avoid sleepwear that has a lot of snaps or is otherwise difficult to get on and off.Soft, breathable natural fabrics like cotton are comfy, and if they fit snugly they're a good alternative to synthetic, flame-resistant clothing (usually made of polyester). Avoid ribbons, strings, ties, and other decorative items that could get wrapped around your baby and pose a choking hazard.DiapersDiapers: Whether you use cloth, disposable, or something in between (like a diaper with a disposable lining and reusable cover), your baby probably will go through 10 to 12 diapers a day at first, so plan accordingly. If you use disposables, you might want to start with small packs of a few different kinds in case certain types irritate your baby's skin or don't fit well.Wipes: Whether you plan to buy wipes, make your own wipes, or use a washcloth and warm water, have plenty on hand so you're prepared.Changing pad or table: You don't have to buy an actual changing table, but you'll probably want to designate a place for diaper changes. Some parents use a changing pad or just put a towel on the floor or bed. (Keep your hand on your baby at all times when changing on an elevated surface.)Baby gearBaby carrier: Wearing your baby means your little one gets to snuggle close to you, and you'll have two free hands to do everything else.When choosing a baby carrier, make sure all straps and harnesses support your baby securely. It's also a good idea to find one that can be laundered or cleaned easily.Note: Although many parents swear by slings, this type of baby carrier has been linked to injuries and suffocation in babies. The U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission has safety tips for parents using slings.Stroller: You'll need an efficient way to take your baby around town. Think about your specific needs: Do you want storage space to make shopping with your baby easier? Do you want a seat that reclines for easy napping? Will you be climbing up and down a lot of stairs? Choosing the right stroller can make your life a lot easier.Car seat: A safe car seat is mandatory. Tempting as it may be, resist buying a used car seat. Safety regulations have changed over the years, and you need one that meets all current guidelines. Also, you may not know if a secondhand seat has been in an accident and should no longer be used.Most car seats produced today have a label with an expiration date printed on it, and they're usually considered safe for five to eight years. Manufacturers won't honor warranties on an expired seat, and there's a good chance the seat will no longer meet current safety features by the time it expires. Always check the expiration date when shopping for a new car seat.Breastfeeding and bottle-feedingNursing or feeding pillow: These are specially designed to support your baby while you're nursing or bottle-feeding, and they can help you avoid straining your shoulders or neck. They're more convenient  and better at keeping your baby in position  than regular pillows.Breastfeeding accessories: Lanolin ointment (available in many drugstores) can relieve sore nipples. And warm or cold gel packs, which fit inside your bra, can soothe swollen or sore breasts. It's normal for your breasts to leak while you're nursing, and breast pads  disposable or reusable, washable ones  will keep you and your shirts nice and dry.Burp cloths (6 to 12): Lightweight cloths (or cloth diapers) catch spit-up and wipe up other baby fluids.Bottles (6 to 12): Newborns usually start with the 4-ounce size, but you'll need some 8-ounce bottles as your child begins to drink more. You'll also need at least as many nipples as bottles.When it comes to which kind of baby bottle to use, some parents prefer glass or stainless steel bottles to avoid possible chemical leaching in plastic bottles. In recent years, there's been concern about bisphenol A (BPA) in plastic bottles. Plastic bottles made today no longer contain any BPA (and usually say so on the bottle), but if you buy used plastic bottles, don't get clear bottles imprinted with the recycling number 7 or the letters ""PC.""Baby bottles and nipples buying guide (Before You Buy series) Play VideoPlayMuteCurrent Time 0:00/Duration Time 3:08Loaded: 0%0:00Progress: 0%0:00Progress: 0%Stream TypeLIVERemaining Time -3:08Playback Rate1ChaptersChaptersdescriptions off, selectedDescriptionssubtitles off, selectedSubtitlescaptions settings, opens captions settings dialogcaptions off, selectedCaptionsdefault, selectedAudio TrackFullscreenThis is a modal window.Caption Settings DialogBeginning of dialog window.

See all videosFormula: If you aren't breastfeeding, you have lots of infant formula options to choose from  check out our formula primer and talk to your healthcare provider.Bottle brushes (2): These are handy for thoroughly scrubbing small parts and crevices in bottles, bottle parts, and nipples.Breast pump: You may want to pump breast milk to feed your baby. Breast pumps can be as simple as a basic hand pump or as efficient as an electric model that allows you to pump from both breasts simultaneously. One popular style comes in a backpack with a small cooler to store milk.Our breast pump guide can help you decide which type to go with and whether to rent or buy.Breast milk bags: You can pump milk straight into a bottle, but many women use specially made plastic storage bags, which don't take up much space in the freezer and can be defrosted easily. The number of bags you'll need depends on how often you plan to pump. Start with one box and buy more when you need them.SleepingCrib and mattress: Many new parents don't need a crib right away, choosing to use a bassinet or play yard with a bassinet feature or bring their newborn into their bed instead. But you'll likely want to move your baby into a crib sometime in the first year, so it's helpful to buy one ahead of time and have it set up.New cribs meet the latest safety standards, but secondhand cribs may be dangerously out of date. If you buy a used crib, look for a sturdy crib with slats that aren't too far apart  no more than 2 3/8 inches (about the size of a soda can). Avoid drop-side cribs, which have caused dozens of baby deaths and have been banned in the United States since 2011. Make sure your baby's mattress fits snugly in the crib.Bedding: You'll see plenty of fancy bedding sets in baby stores, but all you really need are three to five fitted crib sheets and a waterproof crib mattress pad. The bumpers, pillows, quilts, and soft blankets that often come with baby bedding sets shouldn't even go in your baby's crib because they increase the risk of SIDS.Wearable blankets (2 or 3): These fleece or cotton sacks zip over your baby's sleepwear and keep him warm at night. They replace traditional blankets, which aren't safe for sleeping babies because of the risk of SIDS. You may or may not need these, depending on the climate where you live and what season your baby's born in.Swaddling blankets (3): Many newborns love to be swaddled, and having a few blankets made just for this purpose can make your life much easier. Note: Some wearable blankets are also designed for swaddling, with flaps that fold over your baby's arms and secure with Velcro.FeedingWhen your baby is ready for solid food, somewhere between 4 and 6 months of age, these feeding supplies can make the transition easier.Highchair: You can buy a freestanding highchair, a seat that hooks onto a counter or table, or a portable highchair that attaches to a regular chair. But a full-size highchair with a tray is easy to clean, and wheels make it easy to move the chair around. Look for a model with a seat cover you can remove and throw in the washing machine because you can count on food getting mushed into every crack.Bowls (2 to 3): Some parents like baby bowls with suction cups on the bottom that stick to the highchair tray (so they can't be flung to the floor easily).Baby spoons (3 to 5): A rubber-tipped or plastic spoon is easier on your baby's gums and small enough to fit comfortably into a little mouth.Sippy cups (3 to 5):These cups come with a lid and a spout for easy drinking  and they don't spill when knocked over.Cups with handles will probably be easiest for your child to manage at first. Don't buy cups with an attached straw  they leak and are hard to clean.If you're concerned about BPA, phthalates, and other chemicals in plastics, there are plenty of alternatives, including reusable metal water bottles small enough for a baby's hands.Bibs (3 to 5): Waterproof or quick-drying bibs are useful, as are bibs with a pocket at the bottom to catch falling food.BathingBath tub: The kitchen sink works fine at first for bathing your baby, but you might want to move your baby to a tub before too long. Choose one that's sturdy and well made.Soap and shampoo: Look for no-tears formulas that are easier on your baby's skin and eyes. Choose brands that don't list ""fragrance"" as an ingredient if you want to avoid phthalates in your baby's shampoo or soap. (Manufacturers aren't required to list phthalates separately, so they're often included with the fragrance ingredients.)Towels (2 to 3): Regular bath towels are often too big to use on a baby. A soft, hooded towel works well for wrapping up your baby and drying him after his bath.Washcloths (4 to 6): You can always find uses for baby washcloths  put one on the bottom of the tub to keep your baby from sliding around in the tub, or use one to wipe her off after eating.Baby soothers, toys, and entertainmentPacifiers (3 to 5): Some babies love them, some don't. Pacifiers aren't a necessity by any means, but for some parents and babies, these soothers are essential.Bouncy seat: These baby seats bounce up and down when your little one kicks or moves. It's a handy, safe place to put your baby down (thanks to the attached straps), and many babies love the motion.Play mat and gym: These are soft mats with baby toys that dangle from overhead. Babies who aren't mobile yet can have a ball batting at the toys. Fancy versions feature lights and sounds.Toys: Your baby doesn't need a lot of fancy playthings, but it's nice to have a few rattles, musical toys, and soft toys.Books: Chunky board books are a great way to introduce reading to your baby.SafetyAs soon as your child is rolling, crawling, or creeping around, you'll need to be aware of the biggest household dangers so you can childproof your home.A few pieces of safety equipment can help protect your baby from many common hazards.Safety gates: If you have stairs, invest in safety gates for the top and bottom. You can also use a gate to block off areas of the house that might be perilous, such as the bathroom or kitchen.Outlet covers: Exposed outlets are an almost irresistible attraction to curious explorers. Bottom line: Keep them covered.Cupboard and drawer latches: Choose from several types, including ones that latch or twist open and closed. Tug at them to make sure they can withstand numerous tries by a determined toddler.Toilet seat locks: Babies can drown in as little as 2 inches of water, so keep your baby and his toys out of the toilet with a lock. The lock fastens on top of a closed seat and requires you to press a button or undo a latch to open it.Baby monitor: These gadgets come with a transmitter and at least one receiver and allow you to keep tabs on your baby while you're in another room. The transmitter needs to be close enough to your baby's crib to pick up sounds (within 10 feet) but far enough away to ensure that the cord's out of reach if there is one. You can choose a basic audio model or a more expensive video monitor that lets you see your baby.HealthFirst-aid kit: See what to keep in your first-aid kit.Bulb syringe: Use with saline drops to clear your baby's stuffy nose.Teething toys: Chewing on these can ease your baby's discomfort during teething.Digital thermometer: This is an important item to have in your medicine chest.Baby nail scissors or clippers: These help you trim your baby's nails safely.Baby-friendly laundry detergent: Some brands are specially formulated to be gentle on baby skin, although brands for sensitive skin are fine too.Soft-bristled baby brush: This is especially helpful for handling cradle cap.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a.

Top tips for dads on bonding with your baby,https://www.babycenter.com/0_top-tips-for-dads-on-bonding-with-your-baby_3692.bc,"What is bonding?When experts talk about bonding, they're referring to the intense attachment you develop with your baby. It's the feeling that makes you want to shower him with love and affection, or throw yourself in front of a speeding truck to protect him.What if I don't bond right away?Don't worry. Bonding often takes time. As long as you take care of your baby's basic needs and cuddle her regularly, she won't suffer if you don't feel a strong bond at first sight.Some dads feel bonded to their baby within the first few minutes or days of birth, but it may take a little longer  that's perfectly normal. After all, a brand-new little human has just landed in your lap! You also may be helping your partner recover from birth, and you probably haven't slept for more than a couple hours at a time. Take it easy on yourself, and know that the bond will develop before long.In the past, researchers thought it was crucial to spend a lot of time with your newborn during her first few days to establish a bond right away. But now we know that bonding can take place over time. Parents who are separated from their baby soon after delivery for medical reasons or who adopt their kids later in childhood also develop close, loving relationships.""There's so much discussion about bonding with a new baby that parents often feel guilty if they don't feel some incredible attachment to their new baby immediately,"" says Edward Christophersen, a pediatric psychologist in Kansas City, Missouri. ""But bonding is truly an individual experience, and it's just as reasonable to expect the bond to develop over a period of time as it is for it to develop instantaneously.""What are the best ways to bond?The parent-child bond strengthens over time through everyday caregiving. There's no magic formula, but a few things can help the process along.Have skin-to-skin cuddle time. Human touch is soothing for both you and your baby, so hold him often and stroke him gently.Talk and sing to him regularly, with your eyes looking into his and your face up close.Play with him every day. Newborns can enjoy playtime as much as older babies. Your style of play may be different than your partner's, and that's okay. Your baby will love playing with both of you.Carry your baby in a sling or front carrier on walks or as you go about your daily routine.Read to your baby regularly. Hold him close as you read.Mirror his movements and echo his coos and other vocalizations. These are the first steps to communicating with him.Talk to your baby throughout the day. At first it may seem like you're talking to yourself, but it will start to feel more natural if you keep it up.How can I bond when my partner's breastfeeding?Just because your partner is breastfeeding doesn't mean you're out of the parenting loop  caring for your baby is a team effort. Once the baby is fed, you can take over by burping her, singing to her, playing with her, or just holding her. One BabyCenter mom says, ""One of the things we do is have her daddy wear the baby after [she] is fed. She needs to stay upright after feeding, so this lets her settle and get that close time.""If your partner is pumping her breast milk, you can also take over some of your baby's feedings. That way you and your baby have some extra bonding time, and your partner can get some rest. Those quiet middle of the night feedings when just you and your baby are awake can be truly special.What if I continue to struggle to bond with my baby?Let your healthcare provider know if you continue to feel distant from your baby, and if efforts to encourage your feelings of attachment don't seem to be working. It's possible that a mood disorder could be interfering with your ability to bond. Experts have recently begun to recognize that postpartum depression  a condition usually associated with new moms  can affect dads, too.Up to 10 percent of new fathers develop paternal postpartum depression (paternal PPD), according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. Other studies suggest that anywhere from 4 to 25 percent of new dads experience this condition, which usually occurs during the first three to six months after the baby is born. Ask your provider for a referral to a mental health professional right away if any of the following symptoms last longer than two weeks:Loss of interest in activitiesSignificant weight gain or lossFatigue or loss of energyIrritabilityIndecisivenessImpulsive or violent behaviorTrouble sleeping or sleeping too muchFeeling severe anxiety, worthlessness, guiltInability to focusThoughts of harming yourself or othersSubstance abuseThere's no need to feel embarrassed or ashamed about seeking help and treatment  it's the best move you can make for both you and your family.Show sources Hide sources AAP. 2015a.

Gifts for 1-year-olds,https://www.babycenter.com/0_gifts-for-1-year-olds_5384.bc,"Your child's first birthday calls for a celebration. And while 1-year-olds are likely to be as thrilled by the ribbons and wrapping paper on their gift as they are with the present itself, it's fun to pick something out  whether it's a silver keepsake (such as a cup or spoon) or the perfect toy for this age.BooksKids can never have too many books, and birthdays are a great time to add to a toddler's library. The 1-year-old on your list is likely to get a kick out of titles such as Mr. Brown Can Moo, Can You?, by Dr. Seuss, and Noah's Ark, by Lucy Cousins. Consider board books with big bright pictures, which stimulate the child's eyes and hold up under vigorous ""reading.""BlocksNothing encourages a child's innate creativity (not to mention his fine and gross motor skills) like classic building blocks. Pick up a plastic bin and fill it with blocks of all shapes, sizes, and colors. (Remember to keep an eye out for sharp corners and small shapes that can be dangerous for young children.) As your child discovers the joy of building towers as tall as he is  and then knocking them down  your gift will be an instant favorite.Nesting toysFor many 1-year-olds, nothing's more fascinating than taking a bunch of empty containers and stacking them so they nestle one inside the other. Nesting toys help teach kids spatial relations, and many today combine sturdy construction with stimulating colors and patterns. Of course, most children will be equally fascinated by a spare set of measuring cups, but for a birthday it's nice to splurge.Shape sortersMastering the challenge of matching a round peg with the circular hole is a big accomplishment for toddlers. Toys that encourage them to match and sort shapes help them develop essential problem-solving skills. Even better, they're tons of fun. Choose from classic wooden ""peg in the hole"" toys or soft, squishy models with bold black-and-white patterns. Either way, the 1-year-old recipient will be happy!Push toysAnother great choice for the momentous first birthday is a push toy, which your child can use when she starts to walk. Choose from perennial favorites such as a child-sized grocery cart or the vacuum-like toy that ""pops"" as it rolls it around. Some push toys come equipped with an extra activity tray, but when it comes down to it, anything she can propel with her own two feet is a winner in this category.Toy phoneMost 1-year-olds delight in having their own toy phone, especially since Mom or Dad's phone is probably off-limits. When your child picks up his phone, grab yours as well and have a conversation. He may not be saying more than a few words just yet, but he'll love it anyway.Bath toysBy the time a baby is a year old, it's high time to turn bath time into fun time (or even zoo time!). Transform any toddler's tub into a pool of delights with a basket full of water-friendly bath toys. Stock up on everything from hippo bath mitts and soap fish to cheerful terrycloth animals and the requisite rubber ducky. As she gets older, her bath time friends will be an outlet for pretend play and other imagination-driven adventures.Feeding suppliesNow that their diets include solids and finger food as well as breast milk and formula, 1-year-olds are ready for plates, bowls, cups, spoons, and other feeding paraphernalia. Choose a set that features a favorite character like Winnie-the-Pooh or Peter Rabbit. Look for child-safe silverware and crash-friendly plastic plates, cups, and bowls  they'll all be making several trips between the highchair tray and the floor. For a nice touch, bundle several items together in a gift basket.Noisemaker toysToddlers love making noise: It gets attention and makes a less-than-subtle impact on the world around them. So if you want to delight a 1-year-old, give him a toy that rattles, clangs, beeps, or plays music. High-tech options are available, but you can always go the low-tech route instead. Give a child a tambourine or a couple of metal pots and a wooden spoon, and he'll be on cloud nine.Savings bond/stockYou can't go wrong with money. Investing in a savings bond or buying a few shares of stock for a child now can mean she'll have a tidy little nest egg when she's older. Consider making it an annual (or semi-annual) birthday gift  she and her parents will appreciate the gift even more when it comes time to pay for college."
