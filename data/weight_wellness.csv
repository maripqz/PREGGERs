Ideally, its best to work with a nutritionist to get a true picture of whats best for you. But generally speaking, there are some supplements that most people benefit from. These are our top six recommendations.1. BifidobacteriaWhy is it important? Bifidobacteria is one of the most important probiotics for good digestion. In fact, it should make up 70 percent of the beneficial bacteria in your small intestinal tract. Bifidobacteria helps to prevent constipation, diarrhea, food cravings, heartburn and irritable bowel syndrome.People can become deficient in good bacteria from taking antibiotics and steroid medications, drinking chlorinated water, eating fruits and vegetables with pesticides and herbicides on them, or meat and dairy products from animals given antibiotics and steroids.Do I need it?You may ask yourself, do I need to supplement with bifidobacteria? Well, if you have the following symptoms, taking bifidobacteria could help you:Sugar cravingsIBSHeartburnDiarrhea or constipationFrequent colds and virusesLow energyWhat does research say?Bifidobacteria reduces constipation, gas and bloating. (Walker, Gopal, Leyer, Ouwehand, Reifer, Stewart & Miller, 2011)Your overall health and well-being begins in your intestinal tract, which is why bifidobacteria is our top recommendation for intestinal health.Learn moreBifido Balance (capsules)Bifido Powder 2. L-GlutamineWhy is it important?L-glutamine is very important for digestive health. This abundant amino acid heals all tissue in the body, especially irritated tissue in the digestive tract. It is known as the calming amino acid and isvery effective at reducing anxiety as well as sugar and alcohol cravings.If you are not eating sufficient amounts of animal protein, the primary source of glutamine, you may become deficient in it.Do I need it?You may ask yourself, do I need to supplement with L-glutamine? If you have the following symptoms, taking L-glutamine could be beneficial:AnxietySugar or alcohol cravingsConstipation or diarrheaPoor immune systemLow muscle massSlow wound healingWhat does research say?Glutamine supports the immune system and is especially beneficial for patients in the hospital and those fighting viruses or overwhelming infections. (Kim, 2011)For good digestion and fewer cravings, try supplementing with L-glutamine. Clinically, we have found it works wonders for people.Learn moreL-glutamine (vegicaps)L-glutamine powder 3. Omega-3 Fish OilWhy is it important?Omega-3 is an essential fatty acid that is critical for brain health and for reducing inflammation. You may have heard of DHA and EPA, the two main components of omega-3. DHA makes up 60 percent of the fat in your brain, which is why omega-3 isbeneficial for people who have depression, memory problems, difficulty focusing, or are hyperactive.DHA is also important for women who are pregnant, to support the brain and retina development of the baby. EPA reduces inflammation throughout the body, and studies have shown it could be helpful for people with hypertension, heart disease, asthma, arthritis, diabetes, Crohns disease and Alzheimers.Many people do not eat enough omega-3 fish (such as salmon, mackerel and sardines) to maintain a healthy level of omega-3.Do I need it?You may ask yourself, do I need to supplement with omega-3 fish oil? If you have the following symptoms, omega-3 may be beneficial for you:Depression or low moodsMemory problemsHyperactivityADHDHeart diseaseJoint painAsthmaCrohns diseaseDiabetesHypertensionWhat does research say?Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and are beneficial for people with heart disease, depression, cancer, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis and other autoimmune diseases. (Simopoulos, 2002)Because most Americans dont eat enough fish, they are deficient in omega-3 fatty acids. That is why nearly all health care professionals recommend supplementing with at least 1,000 mg omega-3 daily.Learn moreOmega-3 1000 (softgels)DHA 200 (softgels) 4. MagnesiumWhy is it important?Magnesium is the master mineral because it affects over 300 cell interactions in our brain, bones and muscles. Itsimportant for good sleep, normal blood pressure, balanced moods, relieving muscle cramps and charley horses, preventing constipation and reducing those powerful chocolate cravings.Roughly 60 percent of the population is estimated to be deficient in magnesium for a variety of reasons. Our soils are depleted and no longer rich in magnesium, and many of us dont eat enough foods that are good sources of magnesium (such as nuts, beef and leafy green vegetables).Do I need it?You may ask yourself, do I need to supplement with magnesium? If you have the following symptoms, taking magnesium could help:Muscle cramps or charley horsesMenstrual crampsAnxiety or panic attacksConstipationDepressionHigh blood pressureInsomnia and other sleep problemsChocolate cravingsWhat does research say?Sufficient magnesium levels reduce the risk of depression, central obesity and a higher body fat percentage. (Huang, Lu, Cheng, Lee & Tsai, 2012)Clinically, we have found that most people need to supplement with magnesium, and for many, it is the answer for a good nights sleep.Learn moreMagnesium Glycinate 100 (tablets)Mixed MagnesiumCitrate and Glycinate (capsule)Magnesium Citrate (tablets) 5. Vitamin DWhy is it important?The sunshine vitamin is important because almost every cell in your body has a vitamin D receptor. Vitamin Dhelps to prevent osteoporosisby carrying calcium to your bones. It also helps to prevent muscle spasms and chronic bone pain. Vitamin D is alsoessential for a strong immune system.Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to a higher risk of developing infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Other conditions connected to low vitamin D are depression, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension.Most people are deficient in vitamin D because to have adequate levels, you need direct high-noon sun exposure (without sunscreen) on 70 percent of your skin for at least 20 minutes daily. And in the northern latitudes, the suns rays are only strong enough to provide adequate vitamin D during the summer.Do I need it?You may ask yourself, do I need to supplement with vitamin D? Here are signs of vitamin D deficiency:Low moodCarbohydrate cravingsLow energyMuscle painBone painAlways tired and needing more sleepFrequent colds and virusesOsteoporosisHeart diseaseAutoimmune diseasesWhat does research say?Vitamin D plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of healthy bones throughout life. (Wacker & Holick, 2013)At Nutritional Weight & Wellness, we recommend having your vitamin D level checked by your physician. The ideal range is between 50-70 ng/mL. Once you know your level, you can supplement with the appropriate amount of vitamin D3 year round.Learn moreVitamin D3 1000 (softgel)Vitamin D3 with K2 (liquid) 6. MultivitaminWhy is it important?Taking a multivitamin daily is an easy way to ensure that you get an adequate supply of most vitamins and minerals. Multivitamins canprovide energy, help reduce stress, improve mental clarity and reduce risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer.Do I need it?You may ask yourself, do I need to supplement with a multivitamin? It depends on your diet, your lifestyle, and how many individual supplements you are taking. The quality of the ingredients in the multivitamin is extremely important.PickTwice-A-Dayif you are already taking other vitamin and mineral supplements, but you need more B vitamins and prefer taking capsules. We frequently recommend this multivitamin for women.PickElan Vital MultipleorLife Forcefor a broad spectrum of individual vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. We often recommend these multivitamins for men who are not taking other vitamins and minerals.PickAlpha Baseif you need a higher concentration of minerals. Men or women who are not taking minerals separately could benefit from this multivitamin.What does research say?The American Medical Association recommends that all adults take a multivitamin daily because a large proportion of the general population is deficient in vitamins and minerals, which increases the risk of disease.

I wasn't sleeping well, and definitely lacked energy. My pregnancy ended in an induction at 37 weeks due to preeclampsia and high blood pressure. Ultimately, I delivered via C-section and needed a dilation and curettage (D&C) to remove tissue from my uterus and a blood transfusion. I avoided the scale, but I gained at least 50 pounds during this pregnancy, and recovery was a long road.I am now pregnant again, and after taking Nutrition 4 Weight Loss last year and continuing to meet with my nutritionist, JoAnn, I have learned so much about how to take better care of myself. At 31 weeks, I am much smaller overall and less puffy. But, more importantly, I feel so much better this time around. I have energy to play with my almost three-year-old and I am able to sleep at night.Controlling My Blood Sugar with DietAfter getting back on track with the Nutritional Weight and & Wellness way of eating after my early diagnosis of gestational diabetes, I am easily controlling my blood sugar with diet and exercise. At this point, I am still within 6 pounds of my pre-pregnancy weight.

Top Ten Reasons to Fewer Carbohydrates

					 all of which increase risk of disease.  Pregnant women who eat diets high in carbohydrates 					Eating too many carbohydrates can cause many health concerns.					https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/top-ten-reasons-fewer-carbohydrates/

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/top-ten-reasons-fewer-carbohydrates/,"Top Ten Reasons to Fewer Carbohydrates										September 20, 2016				High-carbohydrate diets lower HDL cholesterol and raise triglycerides, which greatly increases your risk of heart disease.Carbohydrates raise insulin, which makes you fat and increases your risk of developing type 2 diabetes.A high intake of carbohydrates and sweetened beverages is associated with an increased risk of developing breast cancer.Carbohydrates eaten in excess raise levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1, which increases risk of heart attacks and strokes.Eating too many carbohydrates makes LDL cholesterol smaller and denser, which in turn raises risk of heart and artery disease.Eating a lot of starches and sugars raises levels of blood fats following a meala condition called postprandial lipemiawhich is another risk factor for heart disease.Eating a lot of starches and sugars can increase the likelihood of a yeast overgrowth, a toxic bowel, and impaired ability of the liver to remove toxic materials from the body, all of which increase risk of disease.Pregnant women who eat diets high in carbohydrates form smaller placentas. This has ominous implications. The formation of the placenta dictates how well the mother will be able to transfer nutrients to the fetus. Further studies are needed to uncover exactly what the long-term effects of diets high in carbohydrates are on the health of newborns.A diet high in grains like wheat will contain phytates that reduce the absorption of valuable nutrients like calcium and zinc. Such a diet will also increase exposure to highly allergenic compounds such as gluten, found in wheat, rye, and barley.Excessive intake of carbohydrates, especially sugar, will weaken immune function. Too many carbohydrates will also increase the damage that stress can do to the body, a fact widely appreciated in critical care medicine.

September 1, 2016				By Anna Derhak, MS, LNToday, one in three Americans is considered to be pre-diabetic or diabetic and in nine years, half are projected to be. The complications of diabetes include kidney damage, neuropathy, blindness, heart disease, obesity, amputations and hearing loss. Diabetes is a serious disease with serious complications.Understanding DiabetesThere are two types of diabetes:Type 1 diabetes: the body doesnt produce enough insulin on its own because of damage that has occurred to the pancreas.Type 2 diabetes: over time, eating excess sugar and/or processed carbohydrates causes the pancreas to produce too much insulin which coats the cells and limits the delivery of glucose into the cells. Doctors refer to this condition as insulin resistance or pre-diabetes, which if not corrected by diet will lead to type 2 diabetes.The hormone insulins job is to carry sugar into cells for energy. Insulin resistance blocks the delivery of sugar into the cells resulting in less energy. Long term, when cells are deprived of glucose/sugar, cell damage occurs. Hearing loss can be one of the first indications of cell damage.Practical Ways to Prevent or Stop Insulin ResistanceSo, what causes this insulin-resistance, and how can we prevent it? The answer is actually pretty simpleit is all about what you choose to eat. Insulin-resistance happens over time and occurs if you eat too many processed carbohydrates such as bread, pasta, crackers, cereal, chips, cookies, candy, ice cream, and/or French fries. Anything that is high in sugar or high in carbohydrates has the potential to eventually make you insulin resistant. This does not mean that all carbohydrates are bad or that you should just avoid them all together. What is does mean is that you need to be careful with the type of carbohydrates you consume.Simple choices you can make daily for diabetes preventionYour Family History Doesnt Determine Your FutureIt is important to understand that you are not doomed to develop diabetes even if you have a family history of this chronic disease. It is preventable with the right knowledge and food choices, even if you are genetically prone to developing diabetes. I have a family history of diabetes (Type 2). My grandfather has it and has had many complications from it, including coronary heart disease, neuropathy, glaucoma and high blood pressure. My uncle is pre-diabetic, and another uncle of mine was pre-diabetic until he radically changed his diet (now he is doing well and is no longer considered pre-diabetic). Even with my genetics, I am proud to say that my food choices have kept me from becoming diabetic. Because of my body type, I realize that I am very sensitive to processed carbohydrates and could easily gain weight and become insulin resistant.Diabetes and PregnancyAnother form of diabetes to be aware of, especially if you plan on having children, is gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes only affects pregnant women, usually after the 20th week of pregnancy. Gestational diabetes occurs when women consume excess amounts of high carbohydrate foods such as soda, cereal, pasta and chips. According to the American Diabetes Association, gestational diabetes occurs in 18% of pregnanciesand it doesnt just affect women who are overweight. I often see clients who were normal weight before pregnancy that developed gestational diabetes. Having gestational diabetes puts women at higher risk of developing it again in future pregnancies and for Type 2 diabetes later in life.When a mother has gestational diabetes, there are several risk factors to the baby including:Increased risk of miscarriageBirth defects in the brain and heartHigher birth weight, which makes for a more difficult labor and deliveryLow-blood sugars in the baby; this can be very dangerous, especially to the babys brainTendency for the baby to develop more fat cells and store more energy (calories) as fatHigher risk of breathing problems for the babyIncreased risk of Type 2 diabetes and obesity later in the life of the child and the motherWhen mothers-to-be become aware of these risks, they are more motivated to avoid processed, high-sugar convenience foods.Diabetes Is Preventable!Be assured, Type 2 diabetes is preventable! The key to prevention or reversal of diabetes is to eat a variety of real foods in balance: real protein, vegetable carbohydrates and healthy fats.For more information on this topic, listen to our October 1, 2011 Dishing Up Nutrition episode Diabetes Prevention.""

Maybe you're eating more veggies or you cut out the sugar. These are all great things, but if you're still drinking and bathing in unfiltered tap water there is another component to your health that you need to know about.How safe is tap water? Read on to find out.""Legally safe"" doesn't mean healthyThere are many sources of water contamination including manufacturing processes, use of fertilizers and pesticides, or sewer overflows. The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) regulates drinking water quality and has set maximum allowable levels of about 90 contaminants as part of the Safe Drinking Water Act (SDWA) to try and prevent contamination leading to illness. All public water systems in the U.S. are required to follow the standards set by the EPA, however, there are violations in all states. In addition, many prescription medications are flushed down the toilet and end up in the water supply. The federal government currently has no testing requirement for prescription drug contaminants.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), contaminants in water can lead to gastrointestinal problems, fertility issues and neurological disorders. Children, pregnant women, people who are elderly, and those with compromised immune systems, are more vulnerable to illness from some of the contaminants.It's not just what you drinkAnother disturbing fact about unfiltered tap water is that the contaminants in it can affect you even when you're not drinking it. A morning shower or bath puts you in contact with chlorine compounds that are toxic when consumed, inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Research has shown that cancer risks associated with chlorinated water may be due more to the bathing in it rather than drinking it.Take steps to protect yourselfAlthough there are standards and protections in place to try and keep the drinking water safe, there is much evidence to show that bottled water and water straight out of the tap is still not 100 percent safe.The first step you can take is to have your water tested by an expert to see what's in your water. Then take steps to remove some of the harmful contaminants in your water:Whole-house water filter and RODI systemBy far the best thing you can do to protect you and your family is to buy a whole house water filter and multi-barrier RODI (reverse osmosis with deionization) pure water system. Not only will this provide you with safe drinking water, it will also give you contaminant-free showers and baths. This will remove all known contaminants, including viral and bacterial microorganisms, lead, asbestos, nitrates, heavy metals, prescription medications and volatile organic chemicals.Reverse osmosis under-sink or countertop systemA whole-house water filter and RODI system is your best bet for quality drinking (and bathing) water. But if this type of system is out of your budget, you may want to consider using an under-sink water filter or countertop system for safer drinking water. Reverse osmosis systems like these are effective in removing some, but not all impurities. They do not remove viral and bacterial microorganisms. Reverse osmosis systems don't provide the same level of protection as a RODI, but it's typically safer than drinking water directly from the tap.Bathroom shower filterIf a home filtration system is out of your budget, another step you can take is to purchase a vitamin C shower filter. Vitamin C is a de-chlorinating agent, able to remove 99 percent of it from the water. Each shower would need to be outfitted with the filter.Change your shower routineAnother option would be to make it a point to take shorter showers and avoid super-hot showers. The shorter time frame cuts your exposure, and the cooler temperature will cut down on the steam that can transport harmful, chlorinated vapor into your system. To cut contaminant exposure even more, try turning off the shower while you soap up.If you choose to use a filtration system of any sort, it's important to ensure you give it regular maintenance. A filter that's built-up with contaminants will become less effective and can actually make your water worse by releasing the build-up back into your water. Always follow the manufacturer's maintenance instructions.It may seem overwhelming to think about how your water sources may affect your health, but there are plenty of things you can do to start protecting yourself and your family.For more information on the topic of water quality, listen to The Quality of Water episode of Dishing Up Nutrition.SOURCES:1 Kresser, Chris.

Eating well while planning to have a baby will not only increase the likelihood of becoming pregnant, but also will lower the risk of pregnancy complications and improve the health of your future child. The standard American diet, high in processed foods and low in nutrients, is a setup for sub-optimal nutrition at the time of conception.Eat balanced and ditch the trans-fatsA smart eating plan contains high quality proteins such as beef, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy; carbohydrates coming from lots of fresh vegetables and fruit; and healthy fats like olive oil, coconut oil, butter, nuts, avocados and olives. Organic foods are a better choice because they do not contain pesticides, hormones or antibiotics, and are not genetically modified. Remember, the baby eats whatever mom eats. Also, managing blood sugar before pregnancy will reduce the risk of gestational diabetes which occurs in eighteen percent of pregnancies (American Diabetes Association). To balance blood sugar, moms-to-be should eat balanced meals with protein, carbohydrates, and fat every few hours.Now is a great time to do a kitchen inventory and go through your refrigerator, freezer and cupboards. If you see ingredient labels that contain hydrogenated oils, stop consuming these products. Otherwise known as trans-fatshydrogenated oils are detrimental to your health and to your baby. You'll find trans-fats in chips, crackers, cookies, coffee creamer, peanut butter, fast food, and several other foods. According to Dr. Chavarro at the Harvard Public School of Health, trans-fats lower fertility rates, and interfere with the production of Omega-3 fatty acids.Key supplements will help prepare your bodyMost people are extremely deficient in Omega-3 fats and planning a pregnancy makes it that much more important to obtain an adequate supply. DHA is an Omega-3 fat that supports fetal brain and eye development. It is found naturally in fatty fish like salmon or sardines, free range eggs, and grass-fed meat. A wonderful way to supplement with extra DHA is in a vegetarian algae form. This is helpful before pregnancy and even more so during pregnancy and breastfeeding.Many women who are thinking about getting pregnant take a prenatal vitamin. Prenatal vitamins make up for any nutritional deficiencies in your diet. Folic acid is one B vitamin that is especially important during this time. It's critical in the prevention of neural tube defects of the brain such as spina bifida and anencephaly. These commonly occur within the first month of pregnancy, when many women don't even know they are pregnant, so it's a good idea to take a prenatal even if you're just thinking about having a baby. Not all prenatal vitamins are the same, and a good quality prenatal will have more vitamins and minerals in absorbable forms that do not cause nausea and constipation. One that we often recommend to our clients is Fem Prenatal.Use caution with beveragesFood and supplements are not the only things to be aware ofwhat you drink has an effect on your body as well. It's easy to unintentionally consume excess sugar from beverages. One sweetened 12-ounce soda contains 11 teaspoons of sugar, and energy drinks typically have 10-20 teaspoons of sugar. Diet sodas are not a better option because the artificial sweeteners, like aspartame, are neurotoxins (toxic to the brain). In addition, you should abstain from alcohol because it decreases fertility and can have negative consequences on the fetus. Studies are mixed with regard to caffeine, but it has been linked to miscarriage and low birth weight in babies, so use caution. The best thing for you to drink is lots of water. Try adding lemon or cucumber slices for extra flavor.Start preparing nowIt's never too early to prepare yourself for pregnancy and childbirth. The nutritional choices you make now will impact the health of you and your baby. These recommendations may seem overwhelming, and you may be concerned about how to put them into practice. At Nutritional Weight & Wellness, we believe that preparing for pregnancy is one of the best times in your life to meet with one of our nutritionists. Not only will you correct some of your eating habits, but you'll also give your baby the best nutrition possible.

As a nutritionist, Ive seen many people struggling to have a baby and it breaks my heart. Too often, people are told they cannot get pregnant on their own and that their only option is treatment, but that is not true! What really frustrates me is that people dont realize that there are many things they can do before turning to reproductive medicine. One piece of advice I have for couples with fertility problems is to explore all of the options carefully before making the huge investment in medications and treatments. One of the options most commonly overlooked is nutrition.I am not guaranteeing that everyone who addresses the nutritional links to fertility is going to have success, but it does work for many people. At Nutritional Weight & Wellness, we have helped dozens of couples become parents. Our greatest reward is meeting the babies when the happy parents return to show them off!With fertility, like many other health epidemics facing our nation, there is a disconnect between what a person puts in his/her mouth and how it affects the body. If your body is deficient in certain nutrients, you are going to experience biochemical imbalances. Various bodily processes will begin to slow down and will not function normally until the imbalances are addressed.Start With The BasicsSo, what can you do nutritionally? It really does start with the basics. Are you living off processed, convenience foods or are you filling your diet with plenty of real foods that are rich in the nutrients necessary to keep your body balanced? Do you have a history of low-fat eating? Are you consuming excess sugar on a regular basis? Have you ever been told that fatty acid deficiencies greatly affect your hormones and your ability to become pregnant? Did you know that hormones can be rebalanced without taking synthetic hormone medications? These are some of things that need to be considered when addressing fertility naturally.What are you eating? Making sure that the foods you are putting in your mouth are nourishing your body is one of the most important things you can do. If you are consuming foods that are full of sugar, chemicals, preservatives, artificial ingredients, and unhealthy fats, you are undermining your efforts to become pregnant. You may not realize the negative impact this has. Even drinking one can of soda per day can reduce a couples fertility! You cannot expect your body to do the things it should if you do not give it the tools it needs. In order to start repairing imbalances, you need to be sure you are getting real proteins, real carbohydrates and real fats four to five times per day.Get the Right Kind and Right Amount of ProteinProteins are essential for hormone balance and healthy pregnancies. People are most successful with fertility when they get the majority of their protein from animal sources (I have seen a number of women struggle to get pregnant when they rely on vegetarian proteins). You also need to be sure that you avoid preservatives and flavorings in proteins, such as nitrates and MSG. If you can find grass-fed meats and wild caught fish, you will not only be getting good protein, but also essential fatty acids to reduce inflammation and balance hormones. Healthy protein choices include chicken, beef, turkey, organic free-range eggs, cheese, and fish. If you have only been eating protein once or twice per day, increase your intake of animal proteins as a starting point.Choose Healthy CarbohydratesCarbohydrates are a necessary part of a balanced eating plan, but it is important to choose the right types. Vegetables and fruits are healthy carbohydrate choices. Choose these and you wont have to fill up on grains. Eating a lot of cereal, bagels, and pasta raises your blood sugar and insulin levels, resulting in excess estrogen in the body. When estrogen levels get too high, your progesterone and testosterone levels drop (in men, too) and it is difficult to get pregnant or maintain a pregnancy. Also, sugar produces a lot of inflammation and insulin resistance in the body, which plays a role in every health problem, including PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) and infertility. Fill your meals and snacks with lots of fresh vegetables and smaller amounts of fruit. Organic fruits and vegetables are ideal, if possible. Besides keeping your blood sugar stable, vegetables provide you with a wealth of vitamins and minerals that are essential to your health.Opt for Plenty of Beneficial FatsWhen it comes to fats, there has been a lot of misinformation. I believe the misinformation and avoidance of beneficial fats have been major factors in creating the significant hormonal imbalances present today in both women and men. Estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are all made from healthy fat and cholesterolthe two things that you have been told for years to keep at a minimum in your diet. If avoiding fats is something you have been doing, begin adding fats back into your diet. To ensure you are getting adequate amounts of fat, make sure you eat some at every meal and snack. I have seen some women become pregnant after adding healthy fats back into their diets along with a couple of key nutrients. Fats to include would be olive oil, avocados, nuts, butter, cream, coconut oil, and olives. Adding fat into your diet may be hard to wrap your mind around because it goes against some of the nutrition advice that you may have heard in the past, but when you look at the bodys biochemistry, it makes sense.Supplements That Can HelpIn addition to balanced eating, when I work with people struggling with fertility, I recommend a few supplements to help them rebalance their biochemistry sooner.GLA (gamma-linolenic acid): This activated Omega-6 fatty acid is at the top of my list. This fatty acid is essential to hormone balance in the body and really works.Omega-3 fish oil: I also frequently recommend adding Omega-3 fish oil to address inflammation in the body, especially if the person is dealing with PCOS.Natural progesterone cream: Progesterone cream is often helpful as well, especially for those women who struggle with maintaining pregnancy. Many women who struggle with fertility have a high estrogen level and low progesterone, which is a big part of the problem. (That is why synthetic hormones are used as a treatment. However, synthetic hormones have side effects that natural methods do not have.)Make Nutrition Your First Step Toward FertilitySo, how important is nutrition to fertility? Its critical. If you are having fertility problems, nutrition is a great place to start for both women and men. Support your body by eating real foods that balance your biochemistry and provide your body with the nutrients essential for fertility. I understand that this may sound overwhelming at first. If you would like help, a nutritionist can start you on the road to pregnancy with a personal fertility plan. I wish you the best and hope that you make nutrition part of your strategy for fertility.

4 Tricks to Curb Morning Sickness

					 recommended to pregnant 					While the exact cause of morning sickness is unknown, here are four tricks that I’ve recommended to pregnant women to help alleviate this uncomfortable part of pregnancy.					https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/4-tricks-curb-morning-sickness/

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/4-tricks-curb-morning-sickness/,"4 Tricks to Curb Morning SicknessBy Brenna Thompson, MS, RD, LD										April 21, 2016				Forget that idea of eating for two that your best friend enjoyed, some expectant mothers can barely eat for themselves due to morning (or afternoon/evening/all day long) sickness.Are you one of them? If so youre not alone, approximately 50 percent of women experience nausea, vomiting, and food aversions associated with morning sickness. Luckily, most of these symptoms pass after the first trimesterusually. While the exact cause of morning sickness is unknown, here are some tricks that Ive recommended to pregnant clients/friends/sisters, to help alleviate this uncomfortable part of pregnancy.1. If mammas blood sugar aint happy, aint nobody happy Well keep this simple, when your blood sugar crashes, you do too. Keep it balanced by eating small snacks or meals every 1-3 hours. This even means having a snack even before you roll out of bed in the morning. Keep some nuts on your night stand, or some rice crackers and a jar of natural peanut butter. During the day try eating a few bites of yogurt or half an avocado sprinkled with sea salt between meals. Foods with protein and/or fat will help keep your blood sugar better balanced than just eating carbohydrates such as fruit, pretzels or toast.2. Cool downTry to eat cold or room temperature foods. When foods are hot, their flavors and scents (this explains your aversion to the smell of your partners coffee) are enhanced, which can be overwhelming. Instead, focus on having foods that taste best when eaten chilled or at room temperature. Try a crunchy broccoli salad mixed with bacon, grapes and high quality mayonnaise or cottage cheese topped with berries and sunflower seeds. You get the idea. One more easy idea is a balanced protein shake made with whey protein powder, coconut milk, and a small bananaanother great way to have a meal without much fuss.3. Cook when youre wellIf you consistently feel terrible at night, dont wait until then to think about cooking. Prep your meals and snacks in the morning or on the weekend when you are hungry. Store leftovers in the freezer so you can easily thaw something out without too much effort. Or, scratch all of that and enlist the help of others. Maybe your partner prepares a small breakfast of sausage and a baked sweet potato topped with butter or coconut oil to eat in bed or later in the morning when you are feeling hungrier.4. Ice, ice babyAbove all, try to stay hydrated. Dehydration will only make nausea worse and is dangerous for both mom and baby. A big glass of water may not sound very appetizing when your stomach is in knots; instead, suck on ice chips. For a little extra nutrition, combine pomegranate or blueberry juice with canned coconut milk then freeze for a refreshing treat on a hot afternoon. This has nothing to do with ice, but ginger is also known to help calm a queasy stomach, so try sipping on ginger tea when feeling nauseous.For more pregnancy and nutrition information, listen to our podcast: Nutrition for Pregnancy with Laurel Riedel.

Spread these throughout the day with one softgel at each meal. Likewise, if you need to support your eyes or have a family history of eye degeneration our nutritionists would also recommend three DHA-200 softgels.However, if you feel like you need extra support for your brain or eyes, consider meeting with a nutritionist to meet your unique needs.With 15% off, April is a great time to try DHA-200, or if youre already taking it to stock up!

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/february-product-special-15-omega-3/,"February Product Special | 15% off Omega-3By Jackie Cartier										January 29, 2016				Throughout the month of February, Nutritional Weight & Wellness is offering 15% off one of our bestsellers, our omega-3 supplement.About omega-3Omega-3 is an essential fatty acid that is critical for brain health and for reducing inflammation. You may have heard of DHA and EPA, the two main components of omega-3. DHA makes up 60 percent of the fat in your brain, which is why omega-3 is beneficial for people who have depression, memory problems, difficulty focusing, or are hyperactive. DHA is also important for women who are pregnant, to support the brain and retina development of the baby. EPA reduces inflammation throughout the body, and studies have shown it could be helpful for people with hypertension, heart disease, asthma, arthritis, diabetes, Crohns disease and Alzheimers.Many people do not eat enough omega-3 fish (such as salmon, mackerel and sardines) to maintain a healthy level of omega-3, which is where the supplement comes in.How to Take ItOur nutritionists and nearly all health care professionals recommend supplementing with 1,000 mg of omega-3 and up to 3,000 mg daily. Its recommended to take it with meals throughout the day; for instance if youre taking 3,000 mg daily, you could take one softgel with breakfast, lunch and dinner.Please note that those with conditions like arthritis or Crohns may benefit from taking up to 9,000 milligrams a day. Additionally, omega-3 has a slight blood thinning effect, so if you are on a blood thinner, consult your doctor before taking this supplement.With 15% off, February is a great time to try omega-3, or if youre already taking it, its the time to stock up!

Six Reasons You Need a Vitamin D Supplement

					 70 percent of pregnant mothers in Boston and 80 percent of their  https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/six-reasons-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement/

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/six-reasons-you-need-vitamin-d-supplement/,"Six Reasons You Need a Vitamin D SupplementBy Kate Crosby, BS, CNP										November 9, 2015				Most people are aware that we get vitamin D from the sun which in turn creates a direct impact on moods, but what else could it impact? In one word, everything. If it sounds like were being dramatic, were not. Literally every tissue and every cell in your body has vitamin D receptors. So while our main source is the suns rays, its not as easy as just stepping outside. Sure, in the summer months theres plenty of sunshine, but theres also plenty of sunscreen preventing us from creating an adequate amount of vitamin D. Then comes winter and if you live north of the latitude of Atlanta, Georgia, youre not getting enough vitamin D from the sun. Either the sun isnt out enough or when it is shining, temps may be cold enough you may not want to be out soaking in the (freezing) sun.As always we try to suggest real food for your nutrients, but the problem with vitamin D is that there are very few foods that contain adequate levels. While wild-caught fatty fish like salmon have some vitamin D, egg yolks, another source, only contain 30 IUs of vitamin D, a drop in the bucket if you are trying to get 4,000 IUs per day. Since were not about to start skimping on the sunscreen, pack up and move to the desert, or eat dozens of eggs a day, we suggest taking vitamin D supplements and heres why...1. Vitamin D and the cancer connectionDr. Cedric Garland, a vitamin D researcher, estimates that 75 percent of cancers could be prevented by getting vitamin D levels in blood to optimal range. This makes sense since additional research also states that the rate of certain cancers (mainly breast, prostate and colorectal cancers) are higher the farther away from the equator you live; indicating a relationship between living in sun-rich areas and reduced rates of cancer.Dr. Holick, a leading vitamin D authority and author of the book The Vitamin D Solution, agrees, stating that you can reduce your cancer risk by 30 to 50 percent by increasing your vitamin D levels. Interestingly, adequate levels are also associated with a better chemotherapy response, less tumor growth and decreased chance of metastasis.2. Vitamin D and the pregnancy connectionIn one northern hemisphere study, 70 percent of pregnant mothers in Boston and 80 percent of their babies are vitamin D deficient. During pregnancy a deficiency can cause preeclampsiahigh blood pressure, headaches, kidney issues and moreand even a higher risk of having a C-section delivery. The good news is that women can stock up on vitamin D levels before, during and after each pregnancy.Furthermore, children deficient in vitamin D are 2.4 times more likely to develop Type I diabetes, the autoimmune form of diabetes.3. Vitamin D and the autoimmune disease connectionAutoimmune diseases that attack healthy cellslike multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis and type I diabetesare all more prevalent in those with a vitamin D deficiency. Similar to the cancer findings listed above, most autoimmune diseases are less common in people living near the equator, again pointing to the importance of adequate levels of vitamin D.The strongest study indicating this connection occurred in Finland, a country with little sunlight and the worlds highest reported incidences of type I diabetes. The findings revealed that Finnish newborns who were given 2000 IUs of vitamin D daily had a nearly 80 percent reduced risk of developing type I diabetes than babies who did not receive the vitamin.4. Vitamin D and the heart disease connectionResearchers have found that low levels of vitamin D allow calcium to accumulate in artery walls, forming a dangerous plaque. When plaque breaks up, which it does, it often causes clots that lead to heart attacks and strokes. Beyond this plaque buildup, high blood pressure is another main cause of heart attacks and strokes. Vitamin D plays a role by relaxing the blood vessels, making them more flexible and therefore lowering blood pressure.5. Vitamin D and the mood connectionYou know how great you feel when you have been in the sun? Thats the vitamin D youre soaking up. Vitamin D, which is made in the skin, can also create those happiness-inducing brain chemicals like serotonin, dopamine, and endorphins. Too little vitamin D and we feel depressed, lazy and have little energy.6. Vitamin D and the obesity connectionResearch tells us there is a relationship between metabolism in fat cells, insulin sensitivity and vitamin D deficiency. Body fat sequesters vitamin D, preventing it from being available to other parts of the body, which is why obese individuals must supplement with extra vitamin D to raise their levels. Often they will need two to three times the amount of vitamin D as a non-obese person.How to get enough vitamin DIf you suspect youre low in vitamin D, and more often than not people are, we recommend having your levels tested by a doctor. At Nutritional Weight & Wellness we like to see the results of a vitamin D 25 (OH) test somewhere between 50 and 70 ng/ml. If youre living in a cold northern climate, use a supplement of 5,000 IUs per day in the winter. Easy to remember because it comes in one 5,000 level small softgel that is so small its a cinch to swallow. For more southern climates (or summer for us northern folks), use a supplement of 3,000 IUs per day year round. For this level use three of the 1,000 level softgels. For children, or anyone who doesnt want to swallow anything, there is also a liquid vitamin D form.For children we recommend a smaller amount (400 IU) dropped straight into their mouth; just a drop of this liquid form contains that amount.Once youve been taking vitamin D for a while we recommend having your levels tested again to make sure youre getting enough. The levels needed can vary quite a bit between people. In closing, these are just a few of the places that vitamin D can impact your health, and we cant stress enough this is one of the most important (and inexpensive) nutrients for your overall health.To learn more about vitamin D, listen to our podcast: Vitamin D Deficiency & Health ProblemsREFERENCES:Michael F.

I had gotten to the point where I didnt feel pretty, I had back pain, my pants were tight and I even had people ask me if I was pregnant. I felt sad and embarrassed about the weight gain and was ready to make a change.I'm A Sugar AddictWeight loss was my goal when I first met with Lea, but I also wanted to prevent chronic illness. My mom has diabetes, my grandpa had it too, and I didnt want to end up with it myself. After talking with Lea, I realized that Im a sugar addict. She helped me understand why the new eating plan would be beneficial for losing weight and also getting over my sugar addiction. Im an info-driven person and love reading up on things so that I truly understand the reasons for making a change before I take action. All the information and tools that Lea provided were so helpful to me being successful.Eating Well Changed How I Felt MentallyIm happy to report that I lost 25 pounds! I dropped from a size 10 to a size 6. The weight loss has been wonderful, but Ive also been surprised by how much happier and less anxious I feel. I was diagnosed with obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD) and depression long ago, and I never would have believed that eating well could change how I felt mentally, but it did. Thats been an amazing benefit of my new eating plan! I was able to test this over the holidays and when I traveledwhen I wasnt eating as well as I normally do. I noticed that I felt more irritable, anxious and depressed. Those experiences have motivated me to stay on my Weight and Wellness Way eating plan.I'm Sleeping Better Than EverIn the past I felt so tired all the time, but since seeing Lea I have much more energy. I no longer feel the need to nap. Plus, Im sleeping deeper and notice that I fall asleep much quicker. I have had trouble sleeping for years and took a prescription sleep medication for 8 years, but I no longer need it!I Kicked My Soda HabitOne thing I never thought Id be able to do is kick my pop habit. Before, I would drink four Pepsis or Cokes per day; I just loved the taste. I slowly tapered down and supplemented with bifido and L-glutamine. One day I noticed that I hadnt had any soda at all and I realized that I didnt even miss it. I havent had any pop for months!One of the best things that has come out of this experience is that I know what I want to do with my life. I feel so passionate about the power of eating real food that Im currently looking into getting my masters degree in nutrition.

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/client-success-stories/nicole-s-story/,"Nicole's Story - 17 Pounds Lost, No Longer Prediabetic*Because everyone is unique, individual results vary.I started the Nutrition 4 Weight Loss Program a bit of a skeptic and I ended as a believer! Ive known about Nutritional Weight & Wellness for many years, hearing their Dishing Up Nutrition program on the radio. I wondered if the Nutrition 4 Weight Loss Program could be any different from other weight loss plans and fully expected that it would just try to sell me something like so many others. After reaching a breaking point with my health, I decided to just try it, and I am so grateful I did. I wasnt being sold just another weight loss program; instead, I got a new lease on life.Like so many other people, Ive struggled some with my weight, healthy eating and moods for most of my life. While it was a struggle, I managed until after my now 3-year-old son was born. When I became pregnant, I was at a good weight. Because I was older (40) and had elevated blood pressure when I conceived, my doctors recommended no exercise and during my third trimester my health took a nose dive. My blood pressure skyrocketed, I couldnt sleep, I had terrible joint pain and major mood swings. I thought this would all subside after giving birth, but it got worse. About a year ago, my doctor said I had prediabetes. After two years of following a doctor-advised eating plan (whole grains, some veggies, lots of fruit and milk), I knew I had to do something else.I finally decided to give Nutritional Weight & Wellness a try. It was the best decision! I love the real food approach; I felt incredible after the 12-week program and continue to feel that way. Giving up grains and sugar were critical for me and eating the Weight & Wellness Way, and I dont even crave grains or sugar. The 12-week result: The redness, puffiness and dryness in my skin is gone. My joint pain disappeared. My allergies are much more under control. Halfway into the class, I had a blood test to check my numbers and my results show I am no longer prediabetic. Additionally, my blood pressure is much more stable. Ive lost more than 11 inches, 17 pounds* and dropped several clothing sizes. And my moods, let me tell you, I am a much more even-tempered person!I also appreciate the benefits this program has had on my family. Since I am the family cook, my son and husband eat mostly like I do. My husband has lost 10 pounds and dropped clothing sizes. My son is eating much less pasta and bread which results in better behavior. I love it!This program has been a life-changer for me. My confidence is back. The old me is back, but an even better version because I have better moods and feel fantastic. Im no longer afraid of food. I know I can maintain my weight and continue to feel good as long as I eat real food. Im on a good path, and I plan to continue.*Most people following the Nutrition 4 Weight Loss Program can expect to lose one pound or more per week, but because everyone is unique, individual results vary.

Ideally, its best to work with a nutritionist to get a true picture of whats best for you. But generally speaking, there are some supplements that most people benefit from. These are our top six recommendations.1. BifidobacteriaWhy is it important? Bifidobacteria is one of the most important probiotics for good digestion. In fact, it should make up 70 percent of the beneficial bacteria in your small intestinal tract. Bifidobacteria helps to prevent constipation, diarrhea, food cravings, heartburn and irritable bowel syndrome.People can become deficient in good bacteria from taking antibiotics and steroid medications, drinking chlorinated water, eating fruits and vegetables with pesticides and herbicides on them, or meat and dairy products from animals given antibiotics and steroids.Do I need it?You may ask yourself, do I need to supplement with bifidobacteria? Well, if you have the following symptoms, taking bifidobacteria could help you:Sugar cravingsIBSHeartburnDiarrhea or constipationFrequent colds and virusesLow energyWhat does research say?Bifidobacteria reduces constipation, gas and bloating. (Walker, Gopal, Leyer, Ouwehand, Reifer, Stewart & Miller, 2011)Your overall health and well-being begins in your intestinal tract, which is why bifidobacteria is our top recommendation for intestinal health.Learn moreBifido Balance (capsules)Bifido Powder 2. L-GlutamineWhy is it important?L-glutamine is very important for digestive health. This abundant amino acid heals all tissue in the body, especially irritated tissue in the digestive tract. It is known as the calming amino acid and isvery effective at reducing anxiety as well as sugar and alcohol cravings.If you are not eating sufficient amounts of animal protein, the primary source of glutamine, you may become deficient in it.Do I need it?You may ask yourself, do I need to supplement with L-glutamine? If you have the following symptoms, taking L-glutamine could be beneficial:AnxietySugar or alcohol cravingsConstipation or diarrheaPoor immune systemLow muscle massSlow wound healingWhat does research say?Glutamine supports the immune system and is especially beneficial for patients in the hospital and those fighting viruses or overwhelming infections. (Kim, 2011)For good digestion and fewer cravings, try supplementing with L-glutamine. Clinically, we have found it works wonders for people.Learn moreL-glutamine (vegicaps)L-glutamine powder 3. Omega-3 Fish OilWhy is it important?Omega-3 is an essential fatty acid that is critical for brain health and for reducing inflammation. You may have heard of DHA and EPA, the two main components of omega-3. DHA makes up 60 percent of the fat in your brain, which is why omega-3 isbeneficial for people who have depression, memory problems, difficulty focusing, or are hyperactive.DHA is also important for women who are pregnant, to support the brain and retina development of the baby. EPA reduces inflammation throughout the body, and studies have shown it could be helpful for people with hypertension, heart disease, asthma, arthritis, diabetes, Crohns disease and Alzheimers.Many people do not eat enough omega-3 fish (such as salmon, mackerel and sardines) to maintain a healthy level of omega-3.Do I need it?You may ask yourself, do I need to supplement with omega-3 fish oil? If you have the following symptoms, omega-3 may be beneficial for you:Depression or low moodsMemory problemsHyperactivityADHDHeart diseaseJoint painAsthmaCrohns diseaseDiabetesHypertensionWhat does research say?Omega-3 fatty acids have anti-inflammatory properties and are beneficial for people with heart disease, depression, cancer, Crohns disease, ulcerative colitis and other autoimmune diseases. (Simopoulos, 2002)Because most Americans dont eat enough fish, they are deficient in omega-3 fatty acids. That is why nearly all health care professionals recommend supplementing with at least 1,000 mg omega-3 daily.Learn moreOmega-3 1000 (softgels)DHA 200 (softgels) 4. MagnesiumWhy is it important?Magnesium is the master mineral because it affects over 300 cell interactions in our brain, bones and muscles. Itsimportant for good sleep, normal blood pressure, balanced moods, relieving muscle cramps and charley horses, preventing constipation and reducing those powerful chocolate cravings.Roughly 60 percent of the population is estimated to be deficient in magnesium for a variety of reasons. Our soils are depleted and no longer rich in magnesium, and many of us dont eat enough foods that are good sources of magnesium (such as nuts, beef and leafy green vegetables).Do I need it?You may ask yourself, do I need to supplement with magnesium? If you have the following symptoms, taking magnesium could help:Muscle cramps or charley horsesMenstrual crampsAnxiety or panic attacksConstipationDepressionHigh blood pressureInsomnia and other sleep problemsChocolate cravingsWhat does research say?Sufficient magnesium levels reduce the risk of depression, central obesity and a higher body fat percentage. (Huang, Lu, Cheng, Lee & Tsai, 2012)Clinically, we have found that most people need to supplement with magnesium, and for many, it is the answer for a good nights sleep.Learn moreMagnesium Glycinate 100 (tablets)Mixed MagnesiumCitrate and Glycinate (capsule)Magnesium Citrate (tablets) 5. Vitamin DWhy is it important?The sunshine vitamin is important because almost every cell in your body has a vitamin D receptor. Vitamin Dhelps to prevent osteoporosisby carrying calcium to your bones. It also helps to prevent muscle spasms and chronic bone pain. Vitamin D is alsoessential for a strong immune system.Low levels of vitamin D have been linked to a higher risk of developing infectious diseases, autoimmune diseases and cancer. Other conditions connected to low vitamin D are depression, Type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and hypertension.Most people are deficient in vitamin D because to have adequate levels, you need direct high-noon sun exposure (without sunscreen) on 70 percent of your skin for at least 20 minutes daily. And in the northern latitudes, the suns rays are only strong enough to provide adequate vitamin D during the summer.Do I need it?You may ask yourself, do I need to supplement with vitamin D? Here are signs of vitamin D deficiency:Low moodCarbohydrate cravingsLow energyMuscle painBone painAlways tired and needing more sleepFrequent colds and virusesOsteoporosisHeart diseaseAutoimmune diseasesWhat does research say?Vitamin D plays a critical role in the development and maintenance of healthy bones throughout life. (Wacker & Holick, 2013)At Nutritional Weight & Wellness, we recommend having your vitamin D level checked by your physician. The ideal range is between 50-70 ng/mL. Once you know your level, you can supplement with the appropriate amount of vitamin D3 year round.Learn moreVitamin D3 1000 (softgel)Vitamin D3 with K2 (liquid) 6. MultivitaminWhy is it important?Taking a multivitamin daily is an easy way to ensure that you get an adequate supply of most vitamins and minerals. Multivitamins canprovide energy, help reduce stress, improve mental clarity and reduce risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer.Do I need it?You may ask yourself, do I need to supplement with a multivitamin? It depends on your diet, your lifestyle, and how many individual supplements you are taking. The quality of the ingredients in the multivitamin is extremely important.PickTwice-A-Dayif you are already taking other vitamin and mineral supplements, but you need more B vitamins and prefer taking capsules. We frequently recommend this multivitamin for women.PickElan Vital MultipleorLife Forcefor a broad spectrum of individual vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. We often recommend these multivitamins for men who are not taking other vitamins and minerals.PickAlpha Baseif you need a higher concentration of minerals. Men or women who are not taking minerals separately could benefit from this multivitamin.What does research say?The American Medical Association recommends that all adults take a multivitamin daily because a large proportion of the general population is deficient in vitamins and minerals, which increases the risk of disease.

The statistics tell the story:30% of children ages 6-11 are overweightAn estimated 32% of boys and 36% of girls born in 2000 will develop diabetesApproximately two million children in the United States have ADHDWhat is causing all of these health problems?Nutrition matters!Unfortunately, many people feel that kids are not really affected by food and that childhood is a time of life when kids can eat what they want. Some parents have the mindset that their kids will outgrow their baby fat. What parents need to know is that nutrition matterseven before conception. What toddlers eat affects their health and well-being in the present and the future. More and more, research is showing that what we eat influences us at the deepest levels of our body, even in how our DNA is expressed.Stick with it and your toddler will come aroundThe toddler years can be a challenging time for feeding your children because it can seem like their preferences change every day. I encourage parents to take advantage of this time when you have control over the foods your children consume and continue to offer them healthy choices.Admittedly, it can take diligence on the part of the parents to get toddlers to develop a taste for new foods. I have experienced some of this with my daughter. From the start, she was very sensitive to texture and never liked things mixed together. In her early toddler years, she did not have much variety, but she ate healthy and unprocessed foods. When she was three-years-old, we started telling her that she had to eat dinner the way it was preparedwhich meant more varietyand that we were not going to separate things anymore. This made for some emotional dinners! However, as we consistently had her try things, she slowly began to like foods she never would have eaten before. Now she eats almost anything I cook. Our daughter knows that even with the foods she still does not like, she always has to take a couple of bites of whatever I serve for meals.The bottom line is that most children will eat what they are given when they are really hungry. Research shows it can take trying a food 10-12 times before a child will like it, so stick with it!Uncover the truth behind clever product marketingAll the convenience foods that are marketed for children make feeding toddlers even more challenging. Next time you are at the grocery store, take a moment and really look at the labels on convenience foods. You will find corn syrup, food colorings, artificial flavors, and often times, hydrogenated oils (this means trans-fats, even when the nutrition facts say zero trans-fats). These ingredients are not really food and can lead to health problems.Some of the products that contain these harmful ingredients are Pop-Tarts, cold cereal, crackers (including teething biscuits, Teddy Grahams, graham crackers, saltines) and cookies, frozen items (dinners, chicken nuggets, etc.), breakfast and granola bars, and many yogurts. The ingredients in these foods are addicting and have a negative impact on your childs health. They will weaken your childs immune system, cause cravings, trigger behavior and focus problems, and result in weight gain. If your kitchen contains these types of products, its time get rid of them and start replenishing your kitchen with real, whole food.Real food makes for happy, healthy toddlersJust like adults, kids need to eat a balance of real proteins, real carbohydrates, and real fats to keep their blood sugar stable and nourish their bodies. A childs digestive system also handles real foods much better than processed foods. Eating balanced meals and snacks whenever possible is critical.Healthy meal and snack ideas to try for your toddler:Scrambled eggs and a piece of whole grain toast with real butter or nut butter.Organic plain, whole-milk yogurt topped with frozen berries and sunflower seeds (snack).Homemade soup or chili.A sandwich with one slice of whole grain bread, turkey, cheese, tomato slices and real mayo. Serve with a piece of fruit.A piece of string cheese or a hard-boiled egg with fruit and olives (snack).Meat with vegetables and rice or sweet potato. Put cold-pressed olive oil or butter on the vegetables.For the EXTREMELY picky eaterSome toddlers are very picky and will only eat bread and noodles. Often times, this is caused by an imbalanced digestive system. This occurs mostly in children who have been on multiple rounds of antibiotics, especially in their first year. While antibiotics do kill off harmful bacteria that cause health problems, they also kill off the good bacteria necessary for proper digestion. Without sufficient good bacteria, it can be harder for a child to digest meats and vegetables. If this is the case with your child, you need to replenish the good bacteria called bifidobacteria, most likely with a supplement. This bacteria is present in breast milk, so it is safe even for newborns.Start slow, but stick with it!If eating this way is new for you, pick just one thing to start with. Try removing all hydrogenated oils from your home and after that has become routine for your family, move on to the next thing. Start with what works best for you, your toddler and family overall. Making changes looks different for every family, but remember that every step makes a difference. It is never too late to start! TagsADHD, Children, Children's Health, Picky eater"

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/getting-smart-about-dairy-products/,"Getting Smart about Dairy ProductsBy Darlene Kvist, MS, CNS, LN										October 25, 2016				It is difficult to be a smart consumer when choosing dairy products because there are several things to consider. Most people focus on fat content, and often choose low-fat dairy options because thats what they have been told is healthy (To learn how to include good fats in your diet overall and avoid damaging fats, read Getting Smart about Fats). You may be surprised to learn that lower fat options are probably not the best choice. But there are other things to think about when making your dairy selections. Read on for some important considerations when choosing dairy products.Full Fat or Low-Fat?After analyzing the fat in breast milk, scientists have found it to be a saturated fat. This is the fat babies and young children need for good brain, retina and bone health. The saturated fat helps to assimilate omega-3 fatty acids into the brain and retina, along with calcium absorption for bones and teeth. Breast milk is considered to be a complete food with a perfect balance of nutrients.Low-fat dairy products, such as skim milk, are deficient in vitamins A and D. Since vitamins A and D are necessary for growth, energy, and learning, food manufactures fortify low-fat dairy products with synthetic vitamin A and D. Synthetic vitamins are never as beneficial as the real vitamins.Another thing to remember about the fat content in dairy products is that when fat is removed from a product, usually carbohydrates or artificial ingredients are added for better flavor and mouth feel.Overall, its better to choose full fat options.A Hidden Danger Often Present in Reduced-Fat DairyThere is another twist to the dairy story. Usually dried milk powder is added to low-fat skim milk products. Because of the spray drying process used to make milk powder, it contains oxidized or damaged cholesterol. Researcher Dr. Kilmer McCully found that oxidized cholesterol can lead to atherosclerosis. Milk powder containing oxidized cholesterol is a common ingredient added to skim milk, low-fat yogurt, low-fat cheese, cheese substitutes and baby formulas. This is another reason to stick with full fat dairy options.Hormones, Another Thing to Watch Out ForThere is still more to the dairy story. Unless labeled hormone free, most milk comes from cows treated with a bovine growth hormone called rBGH or rBST to boost milk production. Milk from cows treated with rBGH contains higher levers of IGF-1, which is a powerful insulin-like hormone that has been linked to cancers of the reproductive system. To avoid bovine growth hormone, it is important to purchase either organic milk or dairy products from hormone-free animals (labeled hormone free).Additional Factors to Consider About Dairy ProductsDairy products may not be a good choice for you. Did you know that more people are allergic to casein, the protein in dairy, than any other food? If this is the case for you, its best to avoid dairy products completely in order to feel your best.The Final Word on Dairy ChoicesAfter extensive research and years of clinical practice, I believe that eating moderate amounts of full fat, hormone-free dairy (organic if possible) is a smarter and safer choice for most people than low-fat dairy products.

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/what-feed-your-baby/,"What to Feed Your BabyBy Jennifer Barnes, MS, LN										October 21, 2016				An Age-By-Age Guide for the First 12 MonthsA question every parent asks at some point is, What should I feed my baby? To find the answer, you may talk with those around you, hit the library, and do a lengthy Google search, only to find that there is a lot of conflicting information out there.As parents, we want to do all we can to bring our children up to be healthy and happy. So lets take a closer look at what you can do in the first 12 months to support your babys health while providing him or her with tasty, easy-to-prepare food to nourish their quickly-growing bodies.Age 0-6 monthsBreast milk is the best food for your baby. It promotes the development of the intestinal tract, preparing it for solid food. It provides the perfect combination of protein, fat and carbohydrates for your baby and includes beneficial bacteria and critical immune-boosting properties that cant be reproduced with outside sources. Continuing with breast milk for at least a year may reduce the risk of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms when introducing solid foods to your baby. It may also shorten the duration of colds and provide immune protection when your baby ventures out of the house and begins to make friends.Of course breast milk is not always an option. If you and your baby arent able to breastfeed, I encourage you to make an appointment with one of our nutritionists. We can give you a plan to be sure your baby is getting the right nutrition early on.What about rice cereal?Lets step back and think, is rice cereal a good first food for babies? Parents often introduce rice cereal to babies around four months of age (sometimes sooner), and it has been recommended by cereal companies and pediatricians, but does that mean its a good first food for babies? Lets take a closer look.Rice cereal is a very processed, high-sugar food.It consists of rice, ground down into flour, and when babies eat it their blood sugar rises too high too fast. What is wrong with high blood sugar for babies? High blood sugar increases the risk of developing insulin resistance, diabetes or obesity later in life.Instead of introducing high-sugar foods, such as rice cereal,we recommend that you start your baby out with unprocessed foods like avocados and sweet potatoes.Foods like these ensure your baby receives nutrient-dense foods that are low in sugar. Supplements for ages 0-6 monthsThere are a few supplements you may want to consider giving your baby, and taking yourself, for your babys optimal health.Bifidobacteria:Whether your baby is breastfed or formula-fed, providing him or her with a probiotic calledbifidobacteriais a fantastic way to support your babys digestion. It can also help reduce skin rashes and allergic reactions to food. Supporting your babys intestinal tract with this good bacteria will also help develop his or her immune system. Supplementing with bifidobacteria is also recommended for moms while breastfeeding.For the baby, place the bifido powder on your fingertip and let your baby suck on your finger. If you are nursing, you can place the powder on your nipple right before a feeding. Give your baby bifidobacteria twice a day if you can.For mom, start with  teaspoon of bifido powderor onecapsule15-20 minutes before meals, three times per day (work your way up to  teaspoon of powder or two capsules). Since the bacteria in the breastfeeding moms intestinal tract influences the babys exposure to beneficial bacteria, its important to make sure moms intestinal tract is as healthy as possible.Vitamin Dis beneficial early on as well. Use aliquid or oil-based vitamin D3 in a dropperand give your baby 400IU up to 800IU (in winter months) per day.DHAis an essential fatty acid key for brain development and eye health. Higher DHA levels are correlated with increases in cognitive and motor skills.4Breastfeeding moms should considering supplementing with 400mg ofDHAto provide adequate amounts in their breast milk. For the baby, an additional 100mg is recommended and can be given in aliquid form.Cod liver oilprovides vitamin A to support immune function and eye health. Give your baby  teaspoon ofcod liver oilbeginning around four months of age (using a dropper).Age 6-7 monthsAs your baby grows, his or her digestive system grows too. But dont feel pressure to rush your baby into eating solid foods. Use breast milk as a main source of food as this allows you to slowly introduce foods such as banana, avocado, and even pureed grass-fed beef, free-range chicken, turkey or fish. You may try a few other soft fruits or vegetables such as butternut squash, steamed cauliflower (pureed), or pear (sauted or steamed, then pureed). Add coconut oil or olive oil and salt to the vegetables. Egg yolk, rich in choline and DHA, is a wonderful food to incorporate. (The egg white is a possible allergen at this age and should be avoided until baby is one year old.)To prepare an egg yolk for your baby, bring a pan of water to a boil and add an egg. Boil for 3-4 minutes and then run the egg under cool water. Now you can carefully peel away and discard the egg white and be left with the runny egg yolk. Top it with a dash of sea salt. Supplements for ages 6-7 monthsContinue supplementing with bifidobacteria, vitamin D, DHA and cod liver oil in same amounts recommended for ages 0-6 months.Age 8-12 monthsAt 8-12 months old, teeth are appearing and your baby probably likes that he or she can pick up food without your help! You wont need to worry about pureeing everything at this point, but cooking firmer fruits and vegetables makes them easy for your little one to digest. You can introduce small amounts of dairy such as cottage cheese or plain yogurt and continue to try other fruits and vegetables.Supplements for ages 8-12 monthsBifidobacteria:Increase the dose to 1/8 teaspoon on a spoon or mixed in water, twice a day.Cod liver oil:Increase the dose to teaspoon in a dropper or spoonContinue with the same amounts of Vitamin D and DHA recommended for ages 0-6 months.Age 12 monthsRice, oats, quinoa and other grains can be introduced at one year. Homemade nut butters, citrus fruit, tomatoes, and cooked leafy greens are fine as well. Whole eggs can be introduced after one year; however, if your baby has reacted to other foods you have introduced, you may consider waiting until 18 months to include the egg white. Be sure to introduce these items one at a time so you can catch any signs of a food sensitivity (rash, digestive discomfort or sleep troubles).Healthy homemade nut butter your baby will loveTo start, follow theCrispy Nuts recipe. Following this recipe involves soaking nuts overnight in water and salt and then dehydrating them in the oven. This will make the nuts easier to digest for your baby.Put the finished Crispy Nuts in a blender or food processor with melted coconut oil (to create a creamy consistency) and salt. Practical, time-saving ideas for making your own baby foodNo-fuss squash:For an easy way to cook a winter squash, simply poke a few holes in the skin and place it in a slow cooker. Cook on low for about four hoursits as simple as that! When you are ready to serve to your baby, add some butter or coconut oil and salt. Perfectly balanced and blended dinner:Your baby will love joining you at the table for a family dinner. When making your family dinner consisting of some type of meat, veggies and fat, simply throw a mix of these foods in the blender with a little water and/or breast milk. Now you have babys dinner for the night. If you have enough left, give it to your baby for lunch the next day or put some in a jar and freeze for another day.Here are some combinations to try:Chicken, sweet potatoes, broccoli, and coconut oil or butterGround grass-fed beef, cauliflower, butternut squash and coconut oil or butterSalmon, Brussels sprouts, carrots, and coconut oil or butterQuick and easy snack:In a pinch with nothing prepared? Try giving your baby some canned pumpkin topped with coconut milk (also from the can). This makes a tasty and smooth snack.On-the-go snack:Dont leave the house without an avocado and a spoon. You will always have an easy snack to keep your baby going when the errands get long or you are out at the park.Remember, breast milk is a fantastic food for your baby, and there is no need to switch to only solid foods the day your baby turns 6-months-old. Take your time introducing new foods and enjoy the process with your baby. Also, be aware of signs of an adverse reaction to a new food, such as a rash that appears a day or two later. The best foods for your baby are the foods found in nature. Lets face it, the less food from a box or a jar we eat, as babies or adults, the better. And shouldnt the goal be to give your baby foods that are as natural as they are?References:Guandalini S.

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/understanding-estrogen-dominance/,"Understanding Estrogen DominanceBy Brenna Thompson, MS, RD, LD										October 11, 2016				Hormone fluctuations that often lead to PMS, bloating, fluid retention, and breast tenderness are usually thought of as a normal part of being a woman. These symptoms, however, may be a sign of high estrogen levels or estrogen dominance. The hormone estrogen may have you thinking this is just a female issue, but men are also impacted by estrogen dominance.Although excess estrogen in the body can lead to health issues, there are things you can do to avoid it. Read on to learn more.Health Concerns Associated with Excess Estrogen LevelsToday, girls as young as 9 and 10 are starting to menstruate, much earlier than the typical age of 13. Other signs of excess estrogen in women include irregular menstrual cycles, endometriosis, infertility, and hormonal headaches. A body sign of high estrogen is excess weight around the hips, thighs and low abdomen, and difficulty losing weight. For some women, estrogen dominance takes a more serious and life-threatening form, such as breast, endometrial or uterine cancer. Autoimmune disorders including lupus and thyroiditis have also been linked to estrogen dominance and other hormone imbalances.Men may experience loss of sex drive, increased abdominal fat, enlarged prostate and prostate cancer. In fact, estrogen is a key contributor to 50% of all prostate cancer cases.Sources of EstrogenWhy are so many people becoming estrogen dominant these days? There are a few different causes:XenoestrogensToxic estrogens, called xenoestrogens, lead to estrogen dominance in both men and women. Xenoestrogens come from things you may come in contact with everyday including plastic water bottles, home-cleaning chemicals, pesticides and herbicides, as well as industrial chemicals that can be found in the air and water. Common names for these chemicals are DDT, PCB, and sulfates used as foaming agents. Although you are not likely to eat these products, simply having contact with them day after day can add up to a toxic load over time in your body.Xenoestrogens can also be found in food sources, mainly pork, beef, and dairy cows that have been given growth hormones orally or through injections. Although it is illegal to treat chickens with growth hormones, most chickens raised in confinement are given antibiotics. The antibiotics used to prevent illness in all livestock are stored in their fat, so when you eat these products antibiotic residues can lead to hormone imbalances and estrogen dominance.Prescription medication with hormonesBirth control pills and hormone replacement therapy can also cause estrogen dominance. Interestingly, the symptoms many women experience with estrogen dominance are masked by these medications. These medications keep estrogen levels consistently high so that hormone fluctuations are not felt and symptoms appear to subside. However, the cause of the symptomshigh estrogenhas not been addressed only masked.Being overweightJust being overweight or obese can lead to high estrogen levels in the body. Excess weight creates and stores excess estrogen in both men and women.Eliminating Excess Estrogen from Your BodyIt is important to eliminate excess estrogen daily. As a nutritionist, I recommend:Getting eight to nine hours of sleep each night.Drinking eight to twelve glasses (8oz. each) of water daily. Make sure it's filtered (not straight out of the tap).Exercising several times each week.Consuming a variety of vegetables, especially leafy green vegetables daily.Supplements That Can HelpWhen clients have symptoms of high estrogen, I often recommend specific supplements to help them eliminate the excess estrogens.Often I start with Estrofactors. This product contains non-soy isoflavones which help relieve premenstrual symptoms including cramping and breast tenderness, as well as hot flashes associated with menopause. Other nutrients including turmeric, rosemary, and resveratrol help the liver convert highly-active forms of estrogen into less active and less damaging forms. However, women taking birth control pills for birth control need to be aware that Estrofactors can make their medication less effective, increasing the risk of pregnancy.Women who are at risk for breast or cervical cancer and women taking hormone replacement therapy may benefit from the protective qualities of Meta I3C. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a compound naturally found in cruciferous vegetables, such as cabbage and Brussels sprouts. Similar to Estrofactors, this product helps the liver breakdown harmful estrogens.For clients who enjoy smoothies, I may have them use Estrium Whey protein in our protein shake recipe. This protein powder contains many vitamins and minerals vital to liver health and estrogen detox. To increase its estrogen detox potency, try blending in extra veggies such as beet greens or baby spinach.Start Ridding Your Body of Excess EstrogenIn the coming days and weeks, how are you going to reduce your exposure to excess estrogen?Here are some easy ways to start:Pack leftovers in glass containers instead of plastic.Eat a variety of green vegetables every day. I like to saut kale for a breakfast frittata, pack a large spinach salad for lunch at work, snack on cauliflower and broccoli in the afternoon, and serve braised purple cabbage at supper.Eat grass-fed meat and free range poultry whenever it is available.Drink eight to twelve glasses of filtered water daily. Reduce or eliminate sugar and processed carbs.Get eight to nine hours of sleep each night.Make sure you get some physical activity in each week.If you have symptoms of estrogen dominance listen ourDishing Up Nutrition episodeto learn more, or call our office to schedule a consultation for personalized solutions.

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/preventing-diabetes-you-have-power-choose-wisely/,"Preventing Diabetes: You Have the Power to Choose Wisely!										September 1, 2016				By Anna Derhak, MS, LNToday, one in three Americans is considered to be pre-diabetic or diabetic and in nine years, half are projected to be. The complications of diabetes include kidney damage, neuropathy, blindness, heart disease, obesity, amputations and hearing loss. Diabetes is a serious disease with serious complications.Understanding DiabetesThere are two types of diabetes:Type 1 diabetes: the body doesnt produce enough insulin on its own because of damage that has occurred to the pancreas.Type 2 diabetes: over time, eating excess sugar and/or processed carbohydrates causes the pancreas to produce too much insulin which coats the cells and limits the delivery of glucose into the cells. Doctors refer to this condition as insulin resistance or pre-diabetes, which if not corrected by diet will lead to type 2 diabetes.The hormone insulins job is to carry sugar into cells for energy. Insulin resistance blocks the delivery of sugar into the cells resulting in less energy. Long term, when cells are deprived of glucose/sugar, cell damage occurs. Hearing loss can be one of the first indications of cell damage.Practical Ways to Prevent or Stop Insulin ResistanceSo, what causes this insulin-resistance, and how can we prevent it? The answer is actually pretty simpleit is all about what you choose to eat. Insulin-resistance happens over time and occurs if you eat too many processed carbohydrates such as bread, pasta, crackers, cereal, chips, cookies, candy, ice cream, and/or French fries. Anything that is high in sugar or high in carbohydrates has the potential to eventually make you insulin resistant. This does not mean that all carbohydrates are bad or that you should just avoid them all together. What is does mean is that you need to be careful with the type of carbohydrates you consume.Simple choices you can make daily for diabetes preventionYour Family History Doesnt Determine Your FutureIt is important to understand that you are not doomed to develop diabetes even if you have a family history of this chronic disease. It is preventable with the right knowledge and food choices, even if you are genetically prone to developing diabetes. I have a family history of diabetes (Type 2). My grandfather has it and has had many complications from it, including coronary heart disease, neuropathy, glaucoma and high blood pressure. My uncle is pre-diabetic, and another uncle of mine was pre-diabetic until he radically changed his diet (now he is doing well and is no longer considered pre-diabetic). Even with my genetics, I am proud to say that my food choices have kept me from becoming diabetic. Because of my body type, I realize that I am very sensitive to processed carbohydrates and could easily gain weight and become insulin resistant.Diabetes and PregnancyAnother form of diabetes to be aware of, especially if you plan on having children, is gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes only affects pregnant women, usually after the 20th week of pregnancy. Gestational diabetes occurs when women consume excess amounts of high carbohydrate foods such as soda, cereal, pasta and chips. According to the American Diabetes Association, gestational diabetes occurs in 18% of pregnanciesand it doesnt just affect women who are overweight. I often see clients who were normal weight before pregnancy that developed gestational diabetes. Having gestational diabetes puts women at higher risk of developing it again in future pregnancies and for Type 2 diabetes later in life.When a mother has gestational diabetes, there are several risk factors to the baby including:Increased risk of miscarriageBirth defects in the brain and heartHigher birth weight, which makes for a more difficult labor and deliveryLow-blood sugars in the baby; this can be very dangerous, especially to the babys brainTendency for the baby to develop more fat cells and store more energy (calories) as fatHigher risk of breathing problems for the babyIncreased risk of Type 2 diabetes and obesity later in the life of the child and the motherWhen mothers-to-be become aware of these risks, they are more motivated to avoid processed, high-sugar convenience foods.Diabetes Is Preventable!Be assured, Type 2 diabetes is preventable! The key to prevention or reversal of diabetes is to eat a variety of real foods in balance: real protein, vegetable carbohydrates and healthy fats.For more information on this topic, listen to our October 1, 2011 Dishing Up Nutrition episode Diabetes Prevention.""

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/what-can-i-do-prepare-my-body-healthy-pregnancy/,"What can I do to prepare my body for a healthy pregnancy?By Kara Carper, MA, CNS, LN										August 17, 2016				There is no more important time to pay special attention to nutrition than pre-conception and pregnancy. Eating well while planning to have a baby will not only increase the likelihood of becoming pregnant, but also will lower the risk of pregnancy complications and improve the health of your future child. The standard American diet, high in processed foods and low in nutrients, is a setup for sub-optimal nutrition at the time of conception.Eat balanced and ditch the trans-fatsA smart eating plan contains high quality proteins such as beef, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy; carbohydrates coming from lots of fresh vegetables and fruit; and healthy fats like olive oil, coconut oil, butter, nuts, avocados and olives. Organic foods are a better choice because they do not contain pesticides, hormones or antibiotics, and are not genetically modified. Remember, the baby eats whatever mom eats. Also, managing blood sugar before pregnancy will reduce the risk of gestational diabetes which occurs in eighteen percent of pregnancies (American Diabetes Association). To balance blood sugar, moms-to-be should eat balanced meals with protein, carbohydrates, and fat every few hours.Now is a great time to do a kitchen inventory and go through your refrigerator, freezer and cupboards. If you see ingredient labels that contain hydrogenated oils, stop consuming these products. Otherwise known as trans-fatshydrogenated oils are detrimental to your health and to your baby. You'll find trans-fats in chips, crackers, cookies, coffee creamer, peanut butter, fast food, and several other foods. According to Dr. Chavarro at the Harvard Public School of Health, trans-fats lower fertility rates, and interfere with the production of Omega-3 fatty acids.Key supplements will help prepare your bodyMost people are extremely deficient in Omega-3 fats and planning a pregnancy makes it that much more important to obtain an adequate supply. DHA is an Omega-3 fat that supports fetal brain and eye development. It is found naturally in fatty fish like salmon or sardines, free range eggs, and grass-fed meat. A wonderful way to supplement with extra DHA is in a vegetarian algae form. This is helpful before pregnancy and even more so during pregnancy and breastfeeding.Many women who are thinking about getting pregnant take a prenatal vitamin. Prenatal vitamins make up for any nutritional deficiencies in your diet. Folic acid is one B vitamin that is especially important during this time. It's critical in the prevention of neural tube defects of the brain such as spina bifida and anencephaly. These commonly occur within the first month of pregnancy, when many women don't even know they are pregnant, so it's a good idea to take a prenatal even if you're just thinking about having a baby. Not all prenatal vitamins are the same, and a good quality prenatal will have more vitamins and minerals in absorbable forms that do not cause nausea and constipation. One that we often recommend to our clients is Fem Prenatal.Use caution with beveragesFood and supplements are not the only things to be aware ofwhat you drink has an effect on your body as well. It's easy to unintentionally consume excess sugar from beverages. One sweetened 12-ounce soda contains 11 teaspoons of sugar, and energy drinks typically have 10-20 teaspoons of sugar. Diet sodas are not a better option because the artificial sweeteners, like aspartame, are neurotoxins (toxic to the brain). In addition, you should abstain from alcohol because it decreases fertility and can have negative consequences on the fetus. Studies are mixed with regard to caffeine, but it has been linked to miscarriage and low birth weight in babies, so use caution. The best thing for you to drink is lots of water. Try adding lemon or cucumber slices for extra flavor.Start preparing nowIt's never too early to prepare yourself for pregnancy and childbirth. The nutritional choices you make now will impact the health of you and your baby. These recommendations may seem overwhelming, and you may be concerned about how to put them into practice. At Nutritional Weight & Wellness, we believe that preparing for pregnancy is one of the best times in your life to meet with one of our nutritionists. Not only will you correct some of your eating habits, but you'll also give your baby the best nutrition possible.

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/nutritions-role-your-fertility/,"Nutrition's Role in Your Fertility										July 28, 2016				By Christina Swigart, MS, LNInfertility is a growing problem for many people in our country; maybe you are one of them. As a nutritionist, Ive seen many people struggling to have a baby and it breaks my heart. Too often, people are told they cannot get pregnant on their own and that their only option is treatment, but that is not true! What really frustrates me is that people dont realize that there are many things they can do before turning to reproductive medicine. One piece of advice I have for couples with fertility problems is to explore all of the options carefully before making the huge investment in medications and treatments. One of the options most commonly overlooked is nutrition.I am not guaranteeing that everyone who addresses the nutritional links to fertility is going to have success, but it does work for many people. At Nutritional Weight & Wellness, we have helped dozens of couples become parents. Our greatest reward is meeting the babies when the happy parents return to show them off!With fertility, like many other health epidemics facing our nation, there is a disconnect between what a person puts in his/her mouth and how it affects the body. If your body is deficient in certain nutrients, you are going to experience biochemical imbalances. Various bodily processes will begin to slow down and will not function normally until the imbalances are addressed.Start With The BasicsSo, what can you do nutritionally? It really does start with the basics. Are you living off processed, convenience foods or are you filling your diet with plenty of real foods that are rich in the nutrients necessary to keep your body balanced? Do you have a history of low-fat eating? Are you consuming excess sugar on a regular basis? Have you ever been told that fatty acid deficiencies greatly affect your hormones and your ability to become pregnant? Did you know that hormones can be rebalanced without taking synthetic hormone medications? These are some of things that need to be considered when addressing fertility naturally.What are you eating? Making sure that the foods you are putting in your mouth are nourishing your body is one of the most important things you can do. If you are consuming foods that are full of sugar, chemicals, preservatives, artificial ingredients, and unhealthy fats, you are undermining your efforts to become pregnant. You may not realize the negative impact this has. Even drinking one can of soda per day can reduce a couples fertility! You cannot expect your body to do the things it should if you do not give it the tools it needs. In order to start repairing imbalances, you need to be sure you are getting real proteins, real carbohydrates and real fats four to five times per day.Get the Right Kind and Right Amount of ProteinProteins are essential for hormone balance and healthy pregnancies. People are most successful with fertility when they get the majority of their protein from animal sources (I have seen a number of women struggle to get pregnant when they rely on vegetarian proteins). You also need to be sure that you avoid preservatives and flavorings in proteins, such as nitrates and MSG. If you can find grass-fed meats and wild caught fish, you will not only be getting good protein, but also essential fatty acids to reduce inflammation and balance hormones. Healthy protein choices include chicken, beef, turkey, organic free-range eggs, cheese, and fish. If you have only been eating protein once or twice per day, increase your intake of animal proteins as a starting point.Choose Healthy CarbohydratesCarbohydrates are a necessary part of a balanced eating plan, but it is important to choose the right types. Vegetables and fruits are healthy carbohydrate choices. Choose these and you wont have to fill up on grains. Eating a lot of cereal, bagels, and pasta raises your blood sugar and insulin levels, resulting in excess estrogen in the body. When estrogen levels get too high, your progesterone and testosterone levels drop (in men, too) and it is difficult to get pregnant or maintain a pregnancy. Also, sugar produces a lot of inflammation and insulin resistance in the body, which plays a role in every health problem, including PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome) and infertility. Fill your meals and snacks with lots of fresh vegetables and smaller amounts of fruit. Organic fruits and vegetables are ideal, if possible. Besides keeping your blood sugar stable, vegetables provide you with a wealth of vitamins and minerals that are essential to your health.Opt for Plenty of Beneficial FatsWhen it comes to fats, there has been a lot of misinformation. I believe the misinformation and avoidance of beneficial fats have been major factors in creating the significant hormonal imbalances present today in both women and men. Estrogen, progesterone, and testosterone are all made from healthy fat and cholesterolthe two things that you have been told for years to keep at a minimum in your diet. If avoiding fats is something you have been doing, begin adding fats back into your diet. To ensure you are getting adequate amounts of fat, make sure you eat some at every meal and snack. I have seen some women become pregnant after adding healthy fats back into their diets along with a couple of key nutrients. Fats to include would be olive oil, avocados, nuts, butter, cream, coconut oil, and olives. Adding fat into your diet may be hard to wrap your mind around because it goes against some of the nutrition advice that you may have heard in the past, but when you look at the bodys biochemistry, it makes sense.Supplements That Can HelpIn addition to balanced eating, when I work with people struggling with fertility, I recommend a few supplements to help them rebalance their biochemistry sooner.GLA (gamma-linolenic acid): This activated Omega-6 fatty acid is at the top of my list. This fatty acid is essential to hormone balance in the body and really works.Omega-3 fish oil: I also frequently recommend adding Omega-3 fish oil to address inflammation in the body, especially if the person is dealing with PCOS.Natural progesterone cream: Progesterone cream is often helpful as well, especially for those women who struggle with maintaining pregnancy. Many women who struggle with fertility have a high estrogen level and low progesterone, which is a big part of the problem. (That is why synthetic hormones are used as a treatment. However, synthetic hormones have side effects that natural methods do not have.)Make Nutrition Your First Step Toward FertilitySo, how important is nutrition to fertility? Its critical. If you are having fertility problems, nutrition is a great place to start for both women and men. Support your body by eating real foods that balance your biochemistry and provide your body with the nutrients essential for fertility. I understand that this may sound overwhelming at first. If you would like help, a nutritionist can start you on the road to pregnancy with a personal fertility plan. I wish you the best and hope that you make nutrition part of your strategy for fertility.

7 Essential Summer Travel Tips

					     CARBS     Sliced bell pepper  Celery  Baby carrots  Grapes  Baby cucumbers  Cauliflower 					Healthy eating can easily get derailed while traveling if you don’t prepare ahead. Here are 7 tips to make your trip as easy, fun and healthy as possible!					https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/7-essential-summer-travel-tips/

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/7-essential-summer-travel-tips/,"7 Essential Summer Travel TipsBy Brenna Thompson, MS, RD, LD										July 26, 2016				We all know how easily a healthy eating plan can be derailed when traveling. If you are traveling this summer, follow these healthy travel tips to stay on track and help prevent weight gain. Bonus, you will keep your energy and mood up for the remaining hectic and fun month of summer!1. Start your trip with a healthy breakfast.Don't set yourself up for a low mood, anxiety, shakiness, brain fog and impatience by leaving home hungry. Before leaving on any trip, I always take time to scramble a couple eggs with any of the previous night's leftovers. To save time, reheat a couple pre-made Turkey Breakfast Sausages and serve them with one slice of rye toast topped with butter. Or if you need to eat and drive, whip up a Protein Shake.2. Plan aheadpack real foods to avoid the drive-thru.I know you're already busy packing for the trip and food is the last thing on your brain, but that's how good habits get broken. Keep up your hard work and pack sliced peppers and cauliflower, hummus, macadamia nuts, Thousand Hills hard salami for snacks. Before leaving home I slice the entire salami into rounds for easy eating while driving. Everything is stored in a small cooler that I can reach while my husband is driving.For people traveling by air, remember that you cannot take any liquids or gels over three ounces through security. This includes jars of nut butters, hummus and yogurt. But single-serve packets of nut butter or cream cheese are okay. Packing your own snacks will not only keep your blood sugar balanced, but it will be much friendlier on your wallet than the airport food.Travel-friendly foods to pack:PROTEINSThousand Hills beef productsWellness Whey Protein PacketsHard boiled eggsNitrate-free turkey jerkySingle-serve full fat yogurtString cheeseFresh sliced nitrate free deli meatFATSOlivesNutsSingle-serve Justin's nut buttersSingle-serve Wholly GuacamoleCream cheeseCARBSSliced bell pepperCeleryBaby carrotsGrapesBaby cucumbersCauliflowerCherry tomatoesHummus3. Stay hydrated with plenty of water.Water should be your number one choice, but other good beverage options include unsweetened tea, coconut water and coffee (limit to 16 ounces per day). Avoid soda, mochas, lattes, energy drinks, sweet tea and lemonade. All these options contain too much sugar and will leave you feeling drained instead of energized. Even those ""healthy"" fruit smoothies will turn into too much sugar. In fact, one ounce of any fruit juice contains just as much sugar as one ounce of soda. I used to love a good mocha while waiting at the airport, but these days I've traded it in for a decaf coffee and simply add a splash of real cream if available. Avoiding caffeine in the afternoon helps me sleep better once I've reached my destination. And not having a mocha eliminates the added sugar I'd be getting from the chocolate syrup. I also make sure I avoid the fake, flavored creamers (because they contain trans fats made from hydrogenated oils) that are sold at most gas stations.4. Bring some quality protein bars if you're in a pinch and need a quick pick-me-up.Although eating real food is ideal, eating a quality protein bar is better than going hungry and splurging on junk food when your blood sugar bottoms out. Most gas stations and airports now carry LARABAR which contain real carbohydrates from dried fruit, and real fats from nuts and/or coconut. But these bars are missing protein and are too high in carbohydrates for many people. Consider splitting the bar with a travel companion and see if the store sells hard boiled eggs or a cheese stick to balance out the bar with protein. You can also plan ahead by packing quality bars such as the U-Can snack bars, EPIC bars and more that we stock.5. If you eat out, choose balanced meals.It's usually best to prepare your own meals and snacks, but there are plenty of good real food choices you can make when eating out. Before leaving home, you can also look for restaurants along your route that serve local and organic produce. It's always fun to try the local cuisine!6. Boost your immunity with Advantage Liquid Concentrate.Take 8-10 drops of Advantage Liquid Concentrate two times per day to support your immune function. Place the drops in a small glass of water and drink up! If you dislike the bitter taste, try adding a squeeze of lemon juice. This supplement is especially important if you're spending time with friends and family that are fighting off a cold or the flu or travelling via airplane where germs are surrounding you.7. Once you arrive at your destination, shop for healthy foods.Look for co-ops, Whole Foods Market and farmers' markets so you can stock up on healthy foods and not rely on eating out your entire trip. These stores are also great places to restock your supply of snacks for the trip back. If most of your meals are eaten at a family member's house, offer to make a side of roasted vegetables instead of corn, baked Sweet Potato Wedges instead of French fries and our Baked Beans instead of beans from a can.For more information, listen to our Dishing Up Nutrition podcast on the topic of Nutrition for the Road: By Plane, Train or Car.SaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSaveSave About the authorBrenna loves nutrition and its life-changing effects.

Or maybe its the high fructose corn syrup in her fruit juice thats making her wheezing problem worse? Most people are unaware of the powerful role that diet and nutrition play in controlling and preventing asthma. As a nutritionist, I have seen children reduce or alleviate their asthma symptoms with food and key nutrients.Asthma cannot necessarily be cured, but most kids with asthma can control it so they have fewer symptoms and can stay active.How Does Asthma Work?First, its important to understand what happens in the body when someone has asthma. Asthma is a chronic disease that affects the airwaysthe tubes that carry air in and out of your lungs. If you have asthma, the inside walls of your airways are inflamed or swollen. This makes the airways sensitive, so they react strongly to things that you are allergic to or find irritating. When the airways react, they get narrower and less air flows to your lungs, causing symptoms like wheezing, coughing, chest tightness and difficulty breathing.Inflammation, a Culprit in Asthma Flare UpsHow does the food you feed your children affect inflammation? The answer: certain foods provoke inflammation and others help soothe it.Foods that provoke inflammation and should be avoided or limited:Sugar and processed carbohydrates including things like fruit snacks, cold cereals, flavored yogurts, candy, juice, breakfast bars, pop tarts, chips, white bread, and crackers.Trans fats and processed fats (bad fats) including things like store-bought bakery items, many pre-packaged foods, many crackers, some ice creams, fast food, anything with hydrogenated or partially hydrogenated oils in the ingredients.Sugar, processed carbohydrates and bad fats are often a huge part of the problem in kids with asthma because they cause inflammation that leads to asthma flare ups. The Journal of Asthma published a study of over 2,000 fifth-graders that found those regularly drinking sweetened beverages were at an increased risk of developing respiratory symptoms and asthma.Foods that soothe inflammation:Whats a parent to do? If you dont feed your kids macaroni and cheese or Pop-Tarts, what are you supposed to feed them? Fortunately, there are many healthy options that taste great:BreakfastScrambled eggs and whole grain toast with butter or real peanut butter (instead of cold cereal).Morning snackOrganic, plain, whole-milk yogurt topped with walnut pieces (if they are able to chew them).LunchHomemade soup or chili are great options. Or try tuna mixed with real mayonnaise on top of one slice of bread. Serve with fresh fruit.Afternoon snackA piece of string cheese and baby carrots.DinnerMeat, vegetables and baby red potatoes or sweet potatoes. Top potatoes with butter.Not only do these kid-friendly suggestions provide a balanced meal of real food, they also offer nutrients that protect against asthma triggers. And the healthy fats in these wholesome snacks actually helps soothe inflammation and irritation.Other Culprits of Asthma EpisodesSugar, processed foods and bad fats cause inflammation, making breathing difficult for kids with asthma. In addition, certain foods and/or environmental pollutants can also cause symptoms to flare. Food triggers vary from child to child, but common ones include:Gluten (the protein found in wheat, barley, rye and other related grains)Dairy productsEggsIf your child has other allergies, skin problems or other immune problems, you may want to consider whether these foods are triggers for your childs asthma. In the Journal of Asthma study on fifth-graders (referenced above), eggs showed a strong correlation with inducing asthma symptoms.If Digestion is a Problem, Asthma May Be TooOne final step to alleviating asthma symptoms is to ensure that your childs digestive system is healthy. The digestive system (especially the small intestine) makes up over two-thirds of the immune system. By maximizing your childs digestive health, you are giving his/her immune system a huge boost and helping calm the inflammation that causes asthma problems. To achieve great digestive health:Eliminate processed foods like crackers, cold cereals, Pop-Tarts, and breakfast barsInclude a good bacteria supplement daily. Bifidobacteria comes in a kid-friendly powder form. Start your child with 1/8 tsp. and work up to  tsp. once or twice per day.Take Baby StepsIf eating this way is new for you, start small. Pick one idea to incorporate, like removing crackers and white bread from your house. After that has become routine for you and your child, move on to the next thing. Its all about taking baby steps. Over time, you will see a huge difference in your childs health. Children are our most precious resource; they represent the future of our communities. Feed them well!

Cooking for a Busy Family

baby carrots and celery sticks and of 					Tips for making family meals a more regular occurrence.					https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/cooking-busy-family/

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/cooking-busy-family/,"Cooking for a Busy FamilyBy Jackie Cartier										June 16, 2016				When Two Pans and A Pot cookbook landed in our mailbox we were skeptical. We get a lot of cookbooks sent our way that ultimately don't really fit our balanced Weight & Wellness Way of eating. But Two Pans and A Pot cookbook author Barry Sayewitz got it and the dishes sound and look delicious. Pecan Crusted Salmon with Basil Cream and Asparagus and Zucchini Pea Pancakes with Yogurt Mint Sauce were two that we can't wait to try. The cookbook isn't just about recipes though, throughout Barry highlights the importance of family meals. We could not agree more. For busy families, getting everyone together for a meal seems as impossible as winning the lottery, but it doesn't have to be! Sure the schedules will need to be juggled but the benefits will last a lifetime.To learn more about how real families make family meals work we chatted with Barry and a busy mom right here at Nutritional Weight & Wellness, Cassie Weness, LD, RD.Q: Describe how important a consistent family meal is for your family and why?Barry: The more often you eat together as a family the better emotional, mental, and physical health your children will enjoy. We've found that family mealtime provides a sense of security, unity and identity.Cassie: Agreed! I have a two-fold answer to add to that. First, when you can get your family gathered to eat at the dinner table you can fuel the growing bodies of your children with real food. What your kids are putting in their mouth today is laying the foundation for their health, or lack of it, as adults. Second, when the family comes together at meal time and the TV is turned off, this is when happenings of the day, good and bad, get talked out. Family meal time can be a great de-stressor for everyone and is a wonderful time to build relationships.Q. What tips would you give a family trying to make meal time a priority?Barry: Kids thrive on structure. Set a time for family meals and know that activities can be planned around it. It helps to get the kids involved in the whole processhelping to set the table, doing some of the food preparation, helping to plan menus and grocery shop. Make meal time family time.Cassie: Something I do every week is ask my kids for one or two main entre items they'd like to see on the upcoming week's dinner menuthey know they have to offer a healthy suggestion! Giving them that option brings an excitement on the night their dish is served ... no persuading them to eat needed on those evenings! I also like to give them a chance to partake in menu planning because it helps them become savvy in putting together a balanced meal containing real protein, vegetable carbohydrates and healthy fat.Q: At meal time and snack time what can I do to make sure that my child is eating healthy food?Cassie: First and foremost, make sure ""the healthy choice is the easy choice"" when your child opens the fridge or the pantry door at home. For example, if you have grapes washed, removed from the stems and placed in a clear glass jar or container your child will be more likely to grab these as an afternoon snack versus unwashed grapes hidden in a produce drawer. Another great idea is to slice up grass-fed summer sausage and place three to four slices in a clear snack size bag so they are easy to grab. Again, making the healthy choice the easy, and visible, choice. As far as healthy eating at meal time is concerned, be sure that you and your partner are modeling healthy eating habits. Actions speak louder than words!And when life gets so crazy you think you don't have time to eat healthy, simply pull out your crockpot! You can put a beef roast (or any meat of your choosing) in the crockpot in the morning; pour  cup of beef broth over the top; sprinkle with salt, pepper, rosemary and thyme; cover and cook on low until it's time for that evening's meal. Not only will the house smell great, but you'll have delicious and tender meat ready to serve when you walk through the door in the evening. Simply pair the meat with steamed green beans (if you buy these frozen they cook in a matter of minutes) and fruit kabobs. I buy 8 inch wooden skewers and thread grapes and strawberry halves onto them for an easy and kid-friendly side dish. Preparing this meal will take you less time than sitting in the fast food drive through, and you can feel good knowing you are fueling your kids' bodies well.Q: When you're having a hectic day what's the easiest meal you'd put together for your family?Cassie: On the craziest days I'm not even going to attempt turning the stove or crockpot on. I simply pull out a stick of Thousand Hills Grass-Fed Beef Summer Sausage (I always keep this on hand for emergencies!) and slice it up. Then I serve the summer sausage with rice crackers, baby carrots and celery sticks and of course, some of the Nutritional Weight & Wellness Lil' Dipper dip (sometimes this is the only way my kiddos will eat raw veggies!). I also cut up whatever fruit I have in the fridge, usually just apples and strawberries and serve a fruit plate as well. It doesn't have to be fancyit just needs to offer protein, vegetable and fruit carbohydrates and some healthy fat!

4 Tricks to Curb Morning Sickness

A big glass of water may not sound very 					While the exact cause of morning sickness is unknown, here are four tricks that I’ve recommended to pregnant women to help alleviate this uncomfortable part of pregnancy.					https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/4-tricks-curb-morning-sickness/

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/4-tricks-curb-morning-sickness/,"4 Tricks to Curb Morning SicknessBy Brenna Thompson, MS, RD, LD										April 21, 2016				Forget that idea of eating for two that your best friend enjoyed, some expectant mothers can barely eat for themselves due to morning (or afternoon/evening/all day long) sickness.Are you one of them? If so youre not alone, approximately 50 percent of women experience nausea, vomiting, and food aversions associated with morning sickness. Luckily, most of these symptoms pass after the first trimesterusually. While the exact cause of morning sickness is unknown, here are some tricks that Ive recommended to pregnant clients/friends/sisters, to help alleviate this uncomfortable part of pregnancy.1. If mammas blood sugar aint happy, aint nobody happy Well keep this simple, when your blood sugar crashes, you do too. Keep it balanced by eating small snacks or meals every 1-3 hours. This even means having a snack even before you roll out of bed in the morning. Keep some nuts on your night stand, or some rice crackers and a jar of natural peanut butter. During the day try eating a few bites of yogurt or half an avocado sprinkled with sea salt between meals. Foods with protein and/or fat will help keep your blood sugar better balanced than just eating carbohydrates such as fruit, pretzels or toast.2. Cool downTry to eat cold or room temperature foods. When foods are hot, their flavors and scents (this explains your aversion to the smell of your partners coffee) are enhanced, which can be overwhelming. Instead, focus on having foods that taste best when eaten chilled or at room temperature. Try a crunchy broccoli salad mixed with bacon, grapes and high quality mayonnaise or cottage cheese topped with berries and sunflower seeds. You get the idea. One more easy idea is a balanced protein shake made with whey protein powder, coconut milk, and a small bananaanother great way to have a meal without much fuss.3. Cook when youre wellIf you consistently feel terrible at night, dont wait until then to think about cooking. Prep your meals and snacks in the morning or on the weekend when you are hungry. Store leftovers in the freezer so you can easily thaw something out without too much effort. Or, scratch all of that and enlist the help of others. Maybe your partner prepares a small breakfast of sausage and a baked sweet potato topped with butter or coconut oil to eat in bed or later in the morning when you are feeling hungrier.4. Ice, ice babyAbove all, try to stay hydrated. Dehydration will only make nausea worse and is dangerous for both mom and baby. A big glass of water may not sound very appetizing when your stomach is in knots; instead, suck on ice chips. For a little extra nutrition, combine pomegranate or blueberry juice with canned coconut milk then freeze for a refreshing treat on a hot afternoon. This has nothing to do with ice, but ginger is also known to help calm a queasy stomach, so try sipping on ginger tea when feeling nauseous.For more pregnancy and nutrition information, listen to our podcast: Nutrition for Pregnancy with Laurel Riedel.

You may have heard of DHA and EPA, the two main components of omega-3. DHA makes up 60 percent of the fat in your brain, which is why omega-3 is beneficial for people who have depression, memory problems, difficulty focusing, or are hyperactive. DHA is also important for women who are pregnant, to support the brain and retina development of the baby. EPA reduces inflammation throughout the body, and studies have shown it could be helpful for people with hypertension, heart disease, asthma, arthritis, diabetes, Crohns disease and Alzheimers.Many people do not eat enough omega-3 fish (such as salmon, mackerel and sardines) to maintain a healthy level of omega-3, which is where the supplement comes in.How to Take ItOur nutritionists and nearly all health care professionals recommend supplementing with 1,000 mg of omega-3 and up to 3,000 mg daily. Its recommended to take it with meals throughout the day; for instance if youre taking 3,000 mg daily, you could take one softgel with breakfast, lunch and dinner.Please note that those with conditions like arthritis or Crohns may benefit from taking up to 9,000 milligrams a day. Additionally, omega-3 has a slight blood thinning effect, so if you are on a blood thinner, consult your doctor before taking this supplement.With 15% off, February is a great time to try omega-3, or if youre already taking it, its the time to stock up!

Today I bring you along as I pack a couple days of my kiddos school lunch.Important workI know it can be a hassle, but truly, a nutritious lunch is so important and beneficial for children to learn and behave in school. From my experience, sugar usually causes more silliness or hyperactivity and gluten more naughtiness so youll see that Im aware of not giving them too much of either.These are ideas that work in our house and I hope they inspire lunches in yours!PrepFirst, I cant stand the idea of all the trash thats associated with school lunches (all those plastic baggies!) so I dont use much throwaway stuff. You can see two of our favorite containers in the following lunch ideas, one is Thermos brand and another is Fuel. One thing to consider about your choice of containers, beyond it keeping your food hot or cold, is that it has to be easy for little hands to open. My kids dont have much time for lunch and I dont want them fussing with the container, cutting into precious eating time.Lastly, Id say give your kids a little bit of choice. I just give them two optionsthis isnt a restaurant!Day 1 lunchesDaughterProtein: Turkey cubes for my daughter. I buy nitrate-free deli meat, the thickest slices you can get, and then I cut it up for her. Similar to other children, Ive learned that shell eat meat protein only if its bite-sized. She wouldnt touch a big hunk of turkey.Fat: I throw in some olives for her fat and, to be honest, shell maybe have only one or two. Getting my kiddos to eat good fats is a challenge for me. But I continue to pack fat, because she wont eat it if it isnt there. Im hoping that peer influence comes into play, you know putting the olives on their fingers and playing with it, then she might eat it...a mom can dream!Carbs: Some of her favorites are raspberries, baby cucumbers and carrots.SonProtein: Sausage is always a hit, I grab the sweet apple Bilinski chicken sausage for my kids (and the cilantro lime for the adults!).Fat: Again, a challenge, but he likes guacamole, so I put it in there.Carbs: Raspberries, baby cucumbers and carrots.Day 2 lunchProtein: Beef chili is a crowd-pleaser. I send it with both of them which is a time saver.Fat: This ones a bit sneaky, and wonderful, because I pureed olives and add that into the chili, a good fat for both of them! My son likes sour cream, another great fat, so I add that too.Carbs: Veggies in the chili and I add grapes for more good carbs.Real talkI dont want to be misleading and say we always have these picture perfect lunches. Sometimes its just not going to happen, maybe I havent been to the grocery store or we oversleep. You have to keep it realistic and allow for a school lunch once in a while if thats what they want; I think its important to have that experience too.Getting aheadI really think half the battle is having a meal plan, think about it in advance and make sure when you grocery shop you have your plan. Once Im home from the store I cut up all the veggies I can, which obviously saves time in the mornings.Beyond that, if you have time, do a big batch of something, try the Nutritional Weight & Wellness chili or maybe the Muffin Tin Meatloaf.What tricks have eased your lunch routine?

I thought it was normal to have intestinal pain and problems almost every time I ate, and my IBS symptoms lasted until my late 30s. At that time, I was eating a diet that was high in processed carbohydrates, low fat, and not much protein.In the late 1990s I started to develop an exercise addiction that led to an eating disorder. I was in and out of the hospital and residential facilities for many years. For me, exercising would temporarily ease my intestinal distress as well as create the endorphins I was lacking. It also helped ease my anxiety.I started listening to Dishing Up Nutrition around the time it first started to air. It wasnt until my third major intestinal surgery in 2012, that I decided I needed lifesaving help. I had stopped absorbing most of what I was eating and I was miserable. I was also diagnosed with osteoporosis in the fall of 2012.I made an appointment with a nutritionist at Nutritional Weight & Wellness to address my eating and lifestyle habits. My nutritionist helped me make the connection that my unhealthy digestion was causing my anxiety, exercise addiction and eating disorder. She explained that neurotransmitters, or good brain chemicals like serotonin, are made in the small intestine. I was deficient in those neurotransmitters most of my life.After one month of eating the Weight & Wellness Way and taking supplements to get my intestines to start to heal, I felt drastic improvements in my health (Read my original success story here). I started on a probiotic, which I like to refer to as my BBB defense system. Not the Better Business Bureau, but rather Beneficial Bifido Bacteria. I also started taking l-glutamine which is very healing to the digestive tract. Bone broth has also been healing to my gut. My favorite recipe for that is in the Weight & Wellness Cookbook and Nutrition Guide.I learned that gluten, soy, dairy, sugar, coffee and alcohol were harming my gut. Eventually I stopped eating all grains and legumes as well. I learned that I wasnt drinking enough water and that I need to drink half my body weight in ounces of water per day. I changed to Reverse Osmosis water versus using my Britta-filtered tap water, because elements such as chlorine and fluoride can be damaging to the gut lining. I notice if I am not drinking enough water because I experience intestinal distress, and water eases those symptoms quickly. I learned that due to my surgeries my intestines were not as efficient as they once were. This means that raw veggies, some raw fruits, and raw nuts are no longer an option for me, but I can still enjoy cooked vegetables. The fruits that are tougher to digest I can cook as well, for example stewed apples. Nut butters are also a great way for me to enjoy nuts.Its important for me to get at least 8 hours of sleep. If I get under 7 hours of sleep my digestion suffers. I have learned to avoid stress and the stress of too much exertion as well. My faith, as well as yoga, has been great at helping me with that.I never made the connection that my poor intestinal health could affect my brain health. I was also unaware the antibiotics taken during childhood killed most of my good gut bacteria. Once my gut started to heal, the most exciting changes were in my thoughts and behaviors. The desire to over-exercise, and my anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behaviors diminished. All my eating disorder thoughts and behaviors left. I was so relieved to be able to learn and trace the actual cause of what led to all of these behaviors! All I needed to do was get change my biochemistry by eating real food. The knowledge of the gut-brain connection was the missing puzzle piece for me.The incredible power of good nutritionShortly after meeting with my nutritionist at Nutritional Weight & Wellness, I was driving home from work and started to head to the gym. All of a sudden I thought to myself, I dont have to go to the gym today!!! I drove home crying knowing that I had reached complete freedom. Keep in mind that in the past, nothing would stop me from going to the gym. I used to drive through awful weather (even a blizzard) to get to there. This is when I realized how powerful nutrition is.Now I eat food that is compatible with my body and brain.Eating animal protein 5 times a day has made a tremendous difference in my brain health, which supports my moods. Eating balanced meals 5-6 times a day is key for me. I always think PFC: protein, fats, and carbohydrates in the form of mostly veggies at every meal and snack. I find the fats so important for me to heal all the damage done to my cells over the years.I feel more confident in my clothes, as I restored to a healthy weight and have had no problems maintaining that.In addition to healing my gut, anxiety, compulsive exercising and anorexia, nutrition has healed me in many other ways. I reversed my osteoporosis, my back pain went away, and I can sleep through the night. I feel free, healthier, and happier. I never dreamed that talking to someone about my nutrition would make such a difference in my life.For more information on intestinal health and eating disorders, listen to the September 12, 2015 podcast of Dishing Up Nutrition with special guest Jennifer Schmid. About the authorJennifer battled anorexia and compulsive exercising for more than 20 years. She was considered to be anorexic, but the bigger problem for her was addictive, excessive exercise. After addressing her intestinal health and nutrition, she is free of her eating disorder and compulsive exercising.

I can relate to you. I never tried to starve myself but I've become very skinny in my thirties due to health problems with a pinched nerve in my neck and a low Vitamin-D level. I've never been good with my eating; either too much or hardly at all. Thanks for sharing your story. I'm trying to get healthy again.

How Food Can Help the Defiant Child

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/how-food-can-help-defiant-child/,"How Food Can Help the Defiant ChildBy JoAnn Ridout, MPH, RD, LD										January 20, 2015				Does your child act out? Do you hear more negative feedback from your childs teacher than you would like? Have you ever wondered if healthier food choices would help to change your childs behavior?It always surprises me when working on meal plans with school-aged children or teens that many go 4-5 hours without a break at school. When your child goes for long periods of time without eating, increased anxiety, irritability, or even a panic attack can occur. You cant change the school schedule, but you can make sure you send the best foods possible to help your kids get through the day on their best behavior.Start at home with a good breakfastBe sure to start your kids off with a high-protein breakfast. Here are some healthy breakfast ideas:Start out the day with scrambled eggs (protein) cooked in butter (fat) and a serving of hash browns (carb) or you could make deviled eggs the night before to make the morning rush a little easier.Try a Protein Shake. Whey protein powder is a great way to increase happy, calm moods, before heading out the door or on the drive to school.Make an egg bake: Simply substitute hash brown potatoes for the bread that is usually in an egg bake recipe. That meal will include eggs and sausage (proteins), potato and veggies (carbs), and cream (healthy fat).Keep the good-behavior-momentum going with a balanced lunchAt Nutritional Weight & Wellness, we recommend eating PFC (protein, fats and carbs) in balance. That is exactly what is needed to de-escalate any defiant behavior your child is exhibiting. Some lunch ideas your child may enjoy are these:A turkey roll-up: 3-4 oz. nitrate-free deli turkey (protein) with cream cheese (fat) and a pickle (carb). Add pea pods, sliced carrots, cucumbers and a sliced apple (carbs) and peanut butter or almond butter (fat) on the side.Wild Rice Meatballs: 3-4 oz. of meatballs (protein) served with cherry tomatoes, bell peppers and celery (carbs), and a small banana (carb) with peanut or almond butter (fat).Homemade chicken nuggets (protein) served with raw broccoli, cauliflower, baby carrots (carbs) and Lil Dipper (fat).Healthy fats and carbohydrates help to stabilize blood sugar, and the protein will help the carbohydrates digest more slowly to have longer lasting positive moods. Whatever combination you send to school with your child, always be sure to include all three elements of a balanced lunch: protein, carbohydrates and fat. (Want more ideas? Check out these 3 Easy School Lunch Ideas).Snacks will help, tooSend your child to school with snacks that include protein, along with carbohydrates and healthy fats. Here are some healthy snack ideas:A nitrate-free beef stick (protein), a clementine (carb) and nuts (fat).A hard-boiled egg (protein) and a small apple (carb) with nut butter (fat).A cheese stick (protein), carrot sticks (carb) and olives (fat).A quality protein bar can be a good snack. Be sure to avoid bars with soy protein and artificial sweeteners.Any of the lunch suggestions in a small portion work for snacks, too.A lunch bag with a freezer pack may be required for some of these ideas.Other ways you can help improve your childs behavior:Stay away from candy, pastries, and high-sugar snacks with artificial flavors and food dyes.Avoid convenience foods made with nitrates, nitrites and MSG.Avoid juice and energy drinks which often contain sugar, caffeine, aspartame and sucralose.Often the convenience foods we grab contain sugar and gluten which are stressful for the brain. These simple carbohydrate foods raise the blood glucose quickly, followed by a quick blood sugar drop that can cause anxiety and depression and can exacerbate behavior. Energy drinks are also bad for the brain and can lead to anxiety, a lack of focus and acting out.Do your best to have your child avoid eating foods containing these ingredients, and youll be amazed at the changes youll see in behavior.Need more help?If you are struggling with your childs behavior, consider making an appointment with a nutrition counselor to help you with a customized plan for meals, snacks and supplements to help you and your child get the most out of the school day!For more information on this topic, listen to our January 17 podcast: How Food Can Help the Defiant Child.

Female Athletes: Hormonal Concerns and Bone Health

					 is the added physical stress of carrying a baby. So the body stops producing estrogen and  https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/female-athletes-hormonal-concerns-and-bone-health/

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/female-athletes-hormonal-concerns-and-bone-health/,"Female Athletes: Hormonal Concerns and Bone HealthBy Brenna Thompson, MS, RD, LD										November 4, 2014				Exercise is important for our health, but it can be a double-edged sword. While it has been shown to improve cardiovascular function, sleep, muscle strength, mood, and self-esteem, there is a tipping point. As a runner on the junior and senior high school track and cross-country team, I developed five stress fractures in my tibia bones. Over the course of four years, my doctors fitted me for several different orthotics to use in my running shoes. Their theory was that my flat feet caused the muscles and tendons on my lower legs to pull and stress the tibia bone, leading to the fractures. Around the age of 16, birth control pills were prescribed as a way to increase my estrogen levels, which would help deposit more calcium into my bones and prevent future fractures.What was never discussed was why my estrogen levels might be low in the first place. The phenomenon of young female athletes experiencing multiple stress fractures and hormone imbalances is more common than you might think. This is often true for adult women as well. Athletic women often look fit and healthy, but underneath their vibrant appearance is a serious condition that is just now beginning to be understood.Female athletes often eat too littleFemale athletes are often under pressure to maintain a thin physique, especially if they participate in gymnastics, tennis, volleyball, running, dance or swimming. Junior and senior high school are already stressful enough, having to strut around in a bathing suit or skin-tight shorts adds another self-esteem test. Athletics, staying in shape, and being competitive all seem on the surface to be very positive behaviors for young women, but they can be a double-edged sword. To stay lean and potentially gain an edge over the competition, some girls knowingly restrict their food and may develop an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia. Other athletes who are perfectly comfortable in their skin may unknowingly under eat based on their exercise demands. This pattern of under eating may start in adolescence, but it can also continue into adulthood, which often leads to hormone imbalances and altered bone density.Restricted eating and hormone imbalance and the effect on the female athleteRestricted eating leads the body to shut down non-essential processes. During times of stress and starvation, the last thing a woman needs is the added physical stress of carrying a baby. So the body stops producing estrogen and progesterone in order to prevent a pregnancy. Many young female athletes notice that during the in-season time of their sport they lose their menstrual cycle, known as amenorrhea. Many girls think of this as normal, or believe it means they are working harder than their teammates. What they do not realize is that the hormones that normally trigger their menstruation also help their bones absorb calcium, and without those hormones their bones become weak. For many athletes their periods begin again once their sport season has ended. But for teens or women who participate in athletics or workouts year round, or those who actively restrict their diet, their cycles may not return. No matter the scenario, activity levels and calorie intake need to be matched in order for proper hormone cycles to be maintained year round, otherwise they risk developing stress fractures and osteoporosis.Restoring balanceIt is estimated that 78 percent of high school female athletes have one or more components of what is called the Female Athlete Triad, which all starts with under eating for high levels of exercise.Not eating enough, restricted eating or eating disorderAmenorrhea (Loss of menstrual cycle)Low bone densityTo help restore menstruation and promote bone health, the underlying calorie deficit needs to be reversed. For some athletes, focusing on eating more through higher calorie meals and snacks is enough. Other athletes will need to decrease their activity level while also increasing their food consumption. If a woman is struggling with an eating disorder, this needs to be addressed before she continues to exercise. Most women find that their periods return within one to three months of increasing their food consumption, but it can depend upon how long the food deficits and hormone imbalance has been going on.Eating to support exercise, hormones and bonesTeens can be picky, and their hunger cues can be radically different from adults (although some adults are picky too). Some people are not hungry during the early morning and skip breakfast before school or work, leaving them starving by lunch. For athletes in school, unless they have packed some snacks, the current USDA school lunch menu will not provide enough calories, protein, or fat to support their activity levels.Athletes and recreational exercisers of all ages need to fuel their bodies properly with real foods. Whipping up a protein shake is a great way for teenagers and adults to bring breakfast to school or work. Studies show that whey protein increases muscle repair, which is just one reason its a great addition to an athletes smoothie. Finger foods such as deli meat or salami paired with a cut up apple and a small container of peanut butter or cream cheese is another great option that can be eaten on the bus, in the hallway before class, or while doing projects at work. Cereal, bagels, Pop-Tarts, and donuts are not healthy options since these processed carbs rob the body of important bone-building minerals and do not provide healthy fats and proteins to make hormones.In schools, class sizes are so large now that students may only have 10-15 minutes to eat once they get their food. The night before class or in the morning before work, parents can help their teen pack a balanced lunch. A high quality thermos will keep leftover chili, chicken wild rice soup, stir-fry, or meatballs warm for hours. Pita pockets stuffed with chicken salad are a delicious way to get young athletes to eat more protein and healthy fat. Serve it with fresh cut veggies and the Lil Dipper ranch dressing for a complete meal. Adult athletes can also use these convenient eating tips to make sure they get enough quality food during busy days.Some athletes will need or want a snack before practice or a workout, great options include:Nitrate-free beef sticks or beef jerkyFruitNutsKIND bars or a quality protein barWhey protein powder in a shaker (mix it with water before the workout).After sport practice or a workout, be sure to serve up a delicious balanced supper with adequate protein to build muscle, vegetable carbohydrates for vitamins and minerals, and healthy fats to make hormones.Hungry for more?For more ideas on how to feed your teen athlete or yourself if you are a regular exerciser, sign up for our Nutrition 4 Peak Performance class.To learn even more,listen to our podcast: Nutrition to Help Female Athletes Prevent Bone Fractures.

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/what-feed-your-baby/,"What to Feed Your BabyBy Jennifer Barnes, MS, LN										October 21, 2016				An Age-By-Age Guide for the First 12 MonthsA question every parent asks at some point is, What should I feed my baby? To find the answer, you may talk with those around you, hit the library, and do a lengthy Google search, only to find that there is a lot of conflicting information out there.As parents, we want to do all we can to bring our children up to be healthy and happy. So lets take a closer look at what you can do in the first 12 months to support your babys health while providing him or her with tasty, easy-to-prepare food to nourish their quickly-growing bodies.Age 0-6 monthsBreast milk is the best food for your baby. It promotes the development of the intestinal tract, preparing it for solid food. It provides the perfect combination of protein, fat and carbohydrates for your baby and includes beneficial bacteria and critical immune-boosting properties that cant be reproduced with outside sources. Continuing with breast milk for at least a year may reduce the risk of adverse gastrointestinal symptoms when introducing solid foods to your baby. It may also shorten the duration of colds and provide immune protection when your baby ventures out of the house and begins to make friends.Of course breast milk is not always an option. If you and your baby arent able to breastfeed, I encourage you to make an appointment with one of our nutritionists. We can give you a plan to be sure your baby is getting the right nutrition early on.What about rice cereal?Lets step back and think, is rice cereal a good first food for babies? Parents often introduce rice cereal to babies around four months of age (sometimes sooner), and it has been recommended by cereal companies and pediatricians, but does that mean its a good first food for babies? Lets take a closer look.Rice cereal is a very processed, high-sugar food.It consists of rice, ground down into flour, and when babies eat it their blood sugar rises too high too fast. What is wrong with high blood sugar for babies? High blood sugar increases the risk of developing insulin resistance, diabetes or obesity later in life.Instead of introducing high-sugar foods, such as rice cereal,we recommend that you start your baby out with unprocessed foods like avocados and sweet potatoes.Foods like these ensure your baby receives nutrient-dense foods that are low in sugar. Supplements for ages 0-6 monthsThere are a few supplements you may want to consider giving your baby, and taking yourself, for your babys optimal health.Bifidobacteria:Whether your baby is breastfed or formula-fed, providing him or her with a probiotic calledbifidobacteriais a fantastic way to support your babys digestion. It can also help reduce skin rashes and allergic reactions to food. Supporting your babys intestinal tract with this good bacteria will also help develop his or her immune system. Supplementing with bifidobacteria is also recommended for moms while breastfeeding.For the baby, place the bifido powder on your fingertip and let your baby suck on your finger. If you are nursing, you can place the powder on your nipple right before a feeding. Give your baby bifidobacteria twice a day if you can.For mom, start with  teaspoon of bifido powderor onecapsule15-20 minutes before meals, three times per day (work your way up to  teaspoon of powder or two capsules). Since the bacteria in the breastfeeding moms intestinal tract influences the babys exposure to beneficial bacteria, its important to make sure moms intestinal tract is as healthy as possible.Vitamin Dis beneficial early on as well. Use aliquid or oil-based vitamin D3 in a dropperand give your baby 400IU up to 800IU (in winter months) per day.DHAis an essential fatty acid key for brain development and eye health. Higher DHA levels are correlated with increases in cognitive and motor skills.4Breastfeeding moms should considering supplementing with 400mg ofDHAto provide adequate amounts in their breast milk. For the baby, an additional 100mg is recommended and can be given in aliquid form.Cod liver oilprovides vitamin A to support immune function and eye health. Give your baby  teaspoon ofcod liver oilbeginning around four months of age (using a dropper).Age 6-7 monthsAs your baby grows, his or her digestive system grows too. But dont feel pressure to rush your baby into eating solid foods. Use breast milk as a main source of food as this allows you to slowly introduce foods such as banana, avocado, and even pureed grass-fed beef, free-range chicken, turkey or fish. You may try a few other soft fruits or vegetables such as butternut squash, steamed cauliflower (pureed), or pear (sauted or steamed, then pureed). Add coconut oil or olive oil and salt to the vegetables. Egg yolk, rich in choline and DHA, is a wonderful food to incorporate. (The egg white is a possible allergen at this age and should be avoided until baby is one year old.)To prepare an egg yolk for your baby, bring a pan of water to a boil and add an egg. Boil for 3-4 minutes and then run the egg under cool water. Now you can carefully peel away and discard the egg white and be left with the runny egg yolk. Top it with a dash of sea salt. Supplements for ages 6-7 monthsContinue supplementing with bifidobacteria, vitamin D, DHA and cod liver oil in same amounts recommended for ages 0-6 months.Age 8-12 monthsAt 8-12 months old, teeth are appearing and your baby probably likes that he or she can pick up food without your help! You wont need to worry about pureeing everything at this point, but cooking firmer fruits and vegetables makes them easy for your little one to digest. You can introduce small amounts of dairy such as cottage cheese or plain yogurt and continue to try other fruits and vegetables.Supplements for ages 8-12 monthsBifidobacteria:Increase the dose to 1/8 teaspoon on a spoon or mixed in water, twice a day.Cod liver oil:Increase the dose to teaspoon in a dropper or spoonContinue with the same amounts of Vitamin D and DHA recommended for ages 0-6 months.Age 12 monthsRice, oats, quinoa and other grains can be introduced at one year. Homemade nut butters, citrus fruit, tomatoes, and cooked leafy greens are fine as well. Whole eggs can be introduced after one year; however, if your baby has reacted to other foods you have introduced, you may consider waiting until 18 months to include the egg white. Be sure to introduce these items one at a time so you can catch any signs of a food sensitivity (rash, digestive discomfort or sleep troubles).Healthy homemade nut butter your baby will loveTo start, follow theCrispy Nuts recipe. Following this recipe involves soaking nuts overnight in water and salt and then dehydrating them in the oven. This will make the nuts easier to digest for your baby.Put the finished Crispy Nuts in a blender or food processor with melted coconut oil (to create a creamy consistency) and salt. Practical, time-saving ideas for making your own baby foodNo-fuss squash:For an easy way to cook a winter squash, simply poke a few holes in the skin and place it in a slow cooker. Cook on low for about four hoursits as simple as that! When you are ready to serve to your baby, add some butter or coconut oil and salt. Perfectly balanced and blended dinner:Your baby will love joining you at the table for a family dinner. When making your family dinner consisting of some type of meat, veggies and fat, simply throw a mix of these foods in the blender with a little water and/or breast milk. Now you have babys dinner for the night. If you have enough left, give it to your baby for lunch the next day or put some in a jar and freeze for another day.Here are some combinations to try:Chicken, sweet potatoes, broccoli, and coconut oil or butterGround grass-fed beef, cauliflower, butternut squash and coconut oil or butterSalmon, Brussels sprouts, carrots, and coconut oil or butterQuick and easy snack:In a pinch with nothing prepared? Try giving your baby some canned pumpkin topped with coconut milk (also from the can). This makes a tasty and smooth snack.On-the-go snack:Dont leave the house without an avocado and a spoon. You will always have an easy snack to keep your baby going when the errands get long or you are out at the park.Remember, breast milk is a fantastic food for your baby, and there is no need to switch to only solid foods the day your baby turns 6-months-old. Take your time introducing new foods and enjoy the process with your baby. Also, be aware of signs of an adverse reaction to a new food, such as a rash that appears a day or two later. The best foods for your baby are the foods found in nature. Lets face it, the less food from a box or a jar we eat, as babies or adults, the better. And shouldnt the goal be to give your baby foods that are as natural as they are?References:Guandalini S.

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/what-can-i-do-prepare-my-body-healthy-pregnancy/,"What can I do to prepare my body for a healthy pregnancy?By Kara Carper, MA, CNS, LN										August 17, 2016				There is no more important time to pay special attention to nutrition than pre-conception and pregnancy. Eating well while planning to have a baby will not only increase the likelihood of becoming pregnant, but also will lower the risk of pregnancy complications and improve the health of your future child. The standard American diet, high in processed foods and low in nutrients, is a setup for sub-optimal nutrition at the time of conception.Eat balanced and ditch the trans-fatsA smart eating plan contains high quality proteins such as beef, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy; carbohydrates coming from lots of fresh vegetables and fruit; and healthy fats like olive oil, coconut oil, butter, nuts, avocados and olives. Organic foods are a better choice because they do not contain pesticides, hormones or antibiotics, and are not genetically modified. Remember, the baby eats whatever mom eats. Also, managing blood sugar before pregnancy will reduce the risk of gestational diabetes which occurs in eighteen percent of pregnancies (American Diabetes Association). To balance blood sugar, moms-to-be should eat balanced meals with protein, carbohydrates, and fat every few hours.Now is a great time to do a kitchen inventory and go through your refrigerator, freezer and cupboards. If you see ingredient labels that contain hydrogenated oils, stop consuming these products. Otherwise known as trans-fatshydrogenated oils are detrimental to your health and to your baby. You'll find trans-fats in chips, crackers, cookies, coffee creamer, peanut butter, fast food, and several other foods. According to Dr. Chavarro at the Harvard Public School of Health, trans-fats lower fertility rates, and interfere with the production of Omega-3 fatty acids.Key supplements will help prepare your bodyMost people are extremely deficient in Omega-3 fats and planning a pregnancy makes it that much more important to obtain an adequate supply. DHA is an Omega-3 fat that supports fetal brain and eye development. It is found naturally in fatty fish like salmon or sardines, free range eggs, and grass-fed meat. A wonderful way to supplement with extra DHA is in a vegetarian algae form. This is helpful before pregnancy and even more so during pregnancy and breastfeeding.Many women who are thinking about getting pregnant take a prenatal vitamin. Prenatal vitamins make up for any nutritional deficiencies in your diet. Folic acid is one B vitamin that is especially important during this time. It's critical in the prevention of neural tube defects of the brain such as spina bifida and anencephaly. These commonly occur within the first month of pregnancy, when many women don't even know they are pregnant, so it's a good idea to take a prenatal even if you're just thinking about having a baby. Not all prenatal vitamins are the same, and a good quality prenatal will have more vitamins and minerals in absorbable forms that do not cause nausea and constipation. One that we often recommend to our clients is Fem Prenatal.Use caution with beveragesFood and supplements are not the only things to be aware ofwhat you drink has an effect on your body as well. It's easy to unintentionally consume excess sugar from beverages. One sweetened 12-ounce soda contains 11 teaspoons of sugar, and energy drinks typically have 10-20 teaspoons of sugar. Diet sodas are not a better option because the artificial sweeteners, like aspartame, are neurotoxins (toxic to the brain). In addition, you should abstain from alcohol because it decreases fertility and can have negative consequences on the fetus. Studies are mixed with regard to caffeine, but it has been linked to miscarriage and low birth weight in babies, so use caution. The best thing for you to drink is lots of water. Try adding lemon or cucumber slices for extra flavor.Start preparing nowIt's never too early to prepare yourself for pregnancy and childbirth. The nutritional choices you make now will impact the health of you and your baby. These recommendations may seem overwhelming, and you may be concerned about how to put them into practice. At Nutritional Weight & Wellness, we believe that preparing for pregnancy is one of the best times in your life to meet with one of our nutritionists. Not only will you correct some of your eating habits, but you'll also give your baby the best nutrition possible.

What Cookware Is Best?

					 months or once a year. They also make great birthday and holiday gifts. Soon you will have a 					We’re sharing the pros and cons of six cookware options in order for you to find your best match.					https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/what-cookware-best/

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/what-cookware-best/,"What Cookware Is Best?By Brenna Thompson, MS, RD, LD										February 22, 2017				Are you looking to update your cookware this year and wondering what the best choices are? We're frequently asked this question by clients looking to get the most out of their food and avoid as many chemicals as possible.So let's dig right in! You may recall several years ago when a study came out showing that residents living near the West Virginia DuPont Teflon (a common non-stick cookware material) factory were at an increased risk for cancer, liver disease, impaired immune systems, and growth defects. It made headlines across the country and since then many people have thrown out and replaced their non-stick cookware believing that the same might be true when it is used in cooking. While studies have been inconclusive, we do know that the chemicals TFA and phosgene that are released when Teflon is heated too high (above 500F) cause headaches, chills, back pain, and fever in humans. Yikes! All signs point to us needing a better option. With this in mind we've created a guide to help you choose the best pots and pans for your cooking needs.Non-Stick CookwareTry anodized aluminum. This coating is extremely durable and some companies boast a lifetime warranty if cared for appropriately. Anodized aluminum can be nearly as hard as a diamond under the right anodizing process. I have been using an anodized aluminum pan for several years now and think it's the best cookware I've found for cooking eggs; they never stick! And cleaning the pan is as easy as using a damp cloth to wipe it off. Some options include,Le Creuset,Calphalon, and more listed here atAll Cookware Find.The Green Pansadvertised on TV are also non-stick; for a while. Several of our nutritionists and their extended families have tried them and found that after about 6 months the ceramic coating began to chip and food began to stick. Even with proper care and cleaning the coating is nowhere near as durable as anodized aluminum.Cast ironis a wonderful non-stick option when it's well seasoned, but this can take time. Something similar happens with the new ceramic/stone bakeware on the market. Both cast iron and stoneware are great non-toxic options. They can withstand very high heat, and distribute that heat evenly through your food. If you want to brown meat and vegetables, or grill indoors these are probably the best option. But be careful when cooking in a new cast iron skillet/pot, the iron will react with acids found in tomatoes, vinegar, wine, and lemon juice causing your food to have a metallic flavor and become discolored. This is not an issue withstonewareor enameled cast iron.Of course cast iron cleanup is different compared to other pots and pans; you never want to use soap since it will remove that beautiful layer of seasoning you are trying to develop. Use a scrubby pad and a little water to remove stuck on food, then wipe it down with a very thin layer of oil. The only downside is how much they weigh. Most 10-12"" cast iron skillets weigh anywhere from 5.5 to 8 pounds without food in them. Finally, another option is an enameled steel and cast iron combo. You've probably seen them in a variety of colors, and they make great Dutch ovens and casserole dishes. The enameled coating allows it to be used on a variety of heating surfaces and makes clean up super easy; and yes, you can use soap.Affordable CookwareAluminum is the least expensive of all the options. These strong pans conduct heat really well and will stand up to a beating. There have been concerns in the past that aluminum may be associated with Alzheimer's disease, but studies have shown that even acidic foods (tomato sauce) cooked in analuminum panfor two hours contained only 0.0024mg of aluminum per cup. This is much less than the 1-10mg that we ingest each day through other foods. However, beware that an aluminum skillet is not non-stick. The trick to using it correctly is making sure it is hot before adding your meat or veggies and of course, using enough butter or coconut oil, or lard helps too. A large aluminum pot works well for making bone broth and large batches of chili.If you're looking for a great all around option, something that's affordable, cooks well, and is almost indestructible,stainless steelis for you. These metal pots and pans are a combination of chromium, nickel, and of course steel. They are non-reactive, which means you can cook anything in them without worry of them leaching into your food or causing off flavors. Often times these products come with a copper bottom or insert to improve their heat conduction. These are the reasons many professional chefs use them. Just like aluminum and copper you need to heat them up before adding your food or you risk it all just sticking to the bottom.Investment CookwareIf you fell in love with Julia Child's kitchen you're probably wondering aboutcopper cookware. Just like aluminum, copper heats up quickly and evenly. Plus, when taken off the heat, it cools down quickly. All good things when it comes to stovetop cooking. However, copper reacts with acids and will leach into food, this is why you will frequently see copper pots that have been ""tinned"" or lined with a different metal, such as aluminum or stainless steel. Copper pots and pans are expensive and need a lot of polishing to keep them pretty.When thinking about upgrading your cookware, consider doing it over time. Instead of buying a less expensive 6 piece set of pots and pans, think about buying one very high quality pan or pot every couple of months or once a year. They also make great birthday and holiday gifts. Soon you will have a fantastic and practical set of cookware, without the pieces you never use.It's pretty amazing how much high quality cookware can make all the difference in the quality and enjoyment of your cooking and food!Once you're set on cookware try some of our favorite recipes, including ourWild Rice Meatballs,Spicy Coconut Stewandmore.SaveSaveSave About the authorBrenna loves nutrition and its life-changing effects.

I wasn't sleeping well, and definitely lacked energy. My pregnancy ended in an induction at 37 weeks due to preeclampsia and high blood pressure. Ultimately, I delivered via C-section and needed a dilation and curettage (D&C) to remove tissue from my uterus and a blood transfusion. I avoided the scale, but I gained at least 50 pounds during this pregnancy, and recovery was a long road.I am now pregnant again, and after taking Nutrition 4 Weight Loss last year and continuing to meet with my nutritionist, JoAnn, I have learned so much about how to take better care of myself. At 31 weeks, I am much smaller overall and less puffy. But, more importantly, I feel so much better this time around. I have energy to play with my almost three-year-old and I am able to sleep at night.Controlling My Blood Sugar with DietAfter getting back on track with the Nutritional Weight and & Wellness way of eating after my early diagnosis of gestational diabetes, I am easily controlling my blood sugar with diet and exercise.

Understanding Estrogen Dominance

Although excess estrogen in the body can lead to health issues, there are things you can do to avoid it.					https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/understanding-estrogen-dominance/

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/understanding-estrogen-dominance/,"Understanding Estrogen DominanceBy Brenna Thompson, MS, RD, LD										October 11, 2016				Hormone fluctuations that often lead to PMS, bloating, fluid retention, and breast tenderness are usually thought of as a normal part of being a woman. These symptoms, however, may be a sign of high estrogen levels or estrogen dominance. The hormone estrogen may have you thinking this is just a female issue, but men are also impacted by estrogen dominance.Although excess estrogen in the body can lead to health issues, there are things you can do to avoid it. Read on to learn more.Health Concerns Associated with Excess Estrogen LevelsToday, girls as young as 9 and 10 are starting to menstruate, much earlier than the typical age of 13. Other signs of excess estrogen in women include irregular menstrual cycles, endometriosis, infertility, and hormonal headaches. A body sign of high estrogen is excess weight around the hips, thighs and low abdomen, and difficulty losing weight. For some women, estrogen dominance takes a more serious and life-threatening form, such as breast, endometrial or uterine cancer. Autoimmune disorders including lupus and thyroiditis have also been linked to estrogen dominance and other hormone imbalances.Men may experience loss of sex drive, increased abdominal fat, enlarged prostate and prostate cancer. In fact, estrogen is a key contributor to 50% of all prostate cancer cases.Sources of EstrogenWhy are so many people becoming estrogen dominant these days? There are a few different causes:XenoestrogensToxic estrogens, called xenoestrogens, lead to estrogen dominance in both men and women. Xenoestrogens come from things you may come in contact with everyday including plastic water bottles, home-cleaning chemicals, pesticides and herbicides, as well as industrial chemicals that can be found in the air and water. Common names for these chemicals are DDT, PCB, and sulfates used as foaming agents. Although you are not likely to eat these products, simply having contact with them day after day can add up to a toxic load over time in your body.Xenoestrogens can also be found in food sources, mainly pork, beef, and dairy cows that have been given growth hormones orally or through injections. Although it is illegal to treat chickens with growth hormones, most chickens raised in confinement are given antibiotics. The antibiotics used to prevent illness in all livestock are stored in their fat, so when you eat these products antibiotic residues can lead to hormone imbalances and estrogen dominance.Prescription medication with hormonesBirth control pills and hormone replacement therapy can also cause estrogen dominance. Interestingly, the symptoms many women experience with estrogen dominance are masked by these medications. These medications keep estrogen levels consistently high so that hormone fluctuations are not felt and symptoms appear to subside. However, the cause of the symptomshigh estrogenhas not been addressed only masked.Being overweightJust being overweight or obese can lead to high estrogen levels in the body. Excess weight creates and stores excess estrogen in both men and women.Eliminating Excess Estrogen from Your BodyIt is important to eliminate excess estrogen daily. As a nutritionist, I recommend:Getting eight to nine hours of sleep each night.Drinking eight to twelve glasses (8oz. each) of water daily. Make sure it's filtered (not straight out of the tap).Exercising several times each week.Consuming a variety of vegetables, especially leafy green vegetables daily.Supplements That Can HelpWhen clients have symptoms of high estrogen, I often recommend specific supplements to help them eliminate the excess estrogens.Often I start with Estrofactors. This product contains non-soy isoflavones which help relieve premenstrual symptoms including cramping and breast tenderness, as well as hot flashes associated with menopause. Other nutrients including turmeric, rosemary, and resveratrol help the liver convert highly-active forms of estrogen into less active and less damaging forms. However, women taking birth control pills for birth control need to be aware that Estrofactors can make their medication less effective, increasing the risk of pregnancy.Women who are at risk for breast or cervical cancer and women taking hormone replacement therapy may benefit from the protective qualities of Meta I3C. Indole-3-carbinol (I3C) is a compound naturally found in cruciferous vegetables, such as cabbage and Brussels sprouts. Similar to Estrofactors, this product helps the liver breakdown harmful estrogens.For clients who enjoy smoothies, I may have them use Estrium Whey protein in our protein shake recipe. This protein powder contains many vitamins and minerals vital to liver health and estrogen detox. To increase its estrogen detox potency, try blending in extra veggies such as beet greens or baby spinach.Start Ridding Your Body of Excess EstrogenIn the coming days and weeks, how are you going to reduce your exposure to excess estrogen?Here are some easy ways to start:Pack leftovers in glass containers instead of plastic.Eat a variety of green vegetables every day. I like to saut kale for a breakfast frittata, pack a large spinach salad for lunch at work, snack on cauliflower and broccoli in the afternoon, and serve braised purple cabbage at supper.Eat grass-fed meat and free range poultry whenever it is available.Drink eight to twelve glasses of filtered water daily. Reduce or eliminate sugar and processed carbs.Get eight to nine hours of sleep each night.Make sure you get some physical activity in each week.If you have symptoms of estrogen dominance listen ourDishing Up Nutrition episodeto learn more, or call our office to schedule a consultation for personalized solutions.

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/preventing-diabetes-you-have-power-choose-wisely/,"Preventing Diabetes: You Have the Power to Choose Wisely!										September 1, 2016				By Anna Derhak, MS, LNToday, one in three Americans is considered to be pre-diabetic or diabetic and in nine years, half are projected to be. The complications of diabetes include kidney damage, neuropathy, blindness, heart disease, obesity, amputations and hearing loss. Diabetes is a serious disease with serious complications.Understanding DiabetesThere are two types of diabetes:Type 1 diabetes: the body doesnt produce enough insulin on its own because of damage that has occurred to the pancreas.Type 2 diabetes: over time, eating excess sugar and/or processed carbohydrates causes the pancreas to produce too much insulin which coats the cells and limits the delivery of glucose into the cells. Doctors refer to this condition as insulin resistance or pre-diabetes, which if not corrected by diet will lead to type 2 diabetes.The hormone insulins job is to carry sugar into cells for energy. Insulin resistance blocks the delivery of sugar into the cells resulting in less energy. Long term, when cells are deprived of glucose/sugar, cell damage occurs. Hearing loss can be one of the first indications of cell damage.Practical Ways to Prevent or Stop Insulin ResistanceSo, what causes this insulin-resistance, and how can we prevent it? The answer is actually pretty simpleit is all about what you choose to eat. Insulin-resistance happens over time and occurs if you eat too many processed carbohydrates such as bread, pasta, crackers, cereal, chips, cookies, candy, ice cream, and/or French fries. Anything that is high in sugar or high in carbohydrates has the potential to eventually make you insulin resistant. This does not mean that all carbohydrates are bad or that you should just avoid them all together. What is does mean is that you need to be careful with the type of carbohydrates you consume.Simple choices you can make daily for diabetes preventionYour Family History Doesnt Determine Your FutureIt is important to understand that you are not doomed to develop diabetes even if you have a family history of this chronic disease. It is preventable with the right knowledge and food choices, even if you are genetically prone to developing diabetes. I have a family history of diabetes (Type 2). My grandfather has it and has had many complications from it, including coronary heart disease, neuropathy, glaucoma and high blood pressure. My uncle is pre-diabetic, and another uncle of mine was pre-diabetic until he radically changed his diet (now he is doing well and is no longer considered pre-diabetic). Even with my genetics, I am proud to say that my food choices have kept me from becoming diabetic. Because of my body type, I realize that I am very sensitive to processed carbohydrates and could easily gain weight and become insulin resistant.Diabetes and PregnancyAnother form of diabetes to be aware of, especially if you plan on having children, is gestational diabetes. Gestational diabetes only affects pregnant women, usually after the 20th week of pregnancy. Gestational diabetes occurs when women consume excess amounts of high carbohydrate foods such as soda, cereal, pasta and chips. According to the American Diabetes Association, gestational diabetes occurs in 18% of pregnanciesand it doesnt just affect women who are overweight. I often see clients who were normal weight before pregnancy that developed gestational diabetes. Having gestational diabetes puts women at higher risk of developing it again in future pregnancies and for Type 2 diabetes later in life.When a mother has gestational diabetes, there are several risk factors to the baby including:Increased risk of miscarriageBirth defects in the brain and heartHigher birth weight, which makes for a more difficult labor and deliveryLow-blood sugars in the baby; this can be very dangerous, especially to the babys brainTendency for the baby to develop more fat cells and store more energy (calories) as fatHigher risk of breathing problems for the babyIncreased risk of Type 2 diabetes and obesity later in the life of the child and the motherWhen mothers-to-be become aware of these risks, they are more motivated to avoid processed, high-sugar convenience foods.Diabetes Is Preventable!Be assured, Type 2 diabetes is preventable! The key to prevention or reversal of diabetes is to eat a variety of real foods in balance: real protein, vegetable carbohydrates and healthy fats.For more information on this topic, listen to our October 1, 2011 Dishing Up Nutrition episode Diabetes Prevention.""

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/what-can-i-do-prepare-my-body-healthy-pregnancy/,"What can I do to prepare my body for a healthy pregnancy?By Kara Carper, MA, CNS, LN										August 17, 2016				There is no more important time to pay special attention to nutrition than pre-conception and pregnancy. Eating well while planning to have a baby will not only increase the likelihood of becoming pregnant, but also will lower the risk of pregnancy complications and improve the health of your future child. The standard American diet, high in processed foods and low in nutrients, is a setup for sub-optimal nutrition at the time of conception.Eat balanced and ditch the trans-fatsA smart eating plan contains high quality proteins such as beef, poultry, fish, eggs and dairy; carbohydrates coming from lots of fresh vegetables and fruit; and healthy fats like olive oil, coconut oil, butter, nuts, avocados and olives. Organic foods are a better choice because they do not contain pesticides, hormones or antibiotics, and are not genetically modified. Remember, the baby eats whatever mom eats. Also, managing blood sugar before pregnancy will reduce the risk of gestational diabetes which occurs in eighteen percent of pregnancies (American Diabetes Association). To balance blood sugar, moms-to-be should eat balanced meals with protein, carbohydrates, and fat every few hours.Now is a great time to do a kitchen inventory and go through your refrigerator, freezer and cupboards. If you see ingredient labels that contain hydrogenated oils, stop consuming these products. Otherwise known as trans-fatshydrogenated oils are detrimental to your health and to your baby. You'll find trans-fats in chips, crackers, cookies, coffee creamer, peanut butter, fast food, and several other foods. According to Dr. Chavarro at the Harvard Public School of Health, trans-fats lower fertility rates, and interfere with the production of Omega-3 fatty acids.Key supplements will help prepare your bodyMost people are extremely deficient in Omega-3 fats and planning a pregnancy makes it that much more important to obtain an adequate supply. DHA is an Omega-3 fat that supports fetal brain and eye development. It is found naturally in fatty fish like salmon or sardines, free range eggs, and grass-fed meat. A wonderful way to supplement with extra DHA is in a vegetarian algae form. This is helpful before pregnancy and even more so during pregnancy and breastfeeding.Many women who are thinking about getting pregnant take a prenatal vitamin. Prenatal vitamins make up for any nutritional deficiencies in your diet. Folic acid is one B vitamin that is especially important during this time. It's critical in the prevention of neural tube defects of the brain such as spina bifida and anencephaly. These commonly occur within the first month of pregnancy, when many women don't even know they are pregnant, so it's a good idea to take a prenatal even if you're just thinking about having a baby. Not all prenatal vitamins are the same, and a good quality prenatal will have more vitamins and minerals in absorbable forms that do not cause nausea and constipation. One that we often recommend to our clients is Fem Prenatal.Use caution with beveragesFood and supplements are not the only things to be aware ofwhat you drink has an effect on your body as well. It's easy to unintentionally consume excess sugar from beverages. One sweetened 12-ounce soda contains 11 teaspoons of sugar, and energy drinks typically have 10-20 teaspoons of sugar. Diet sodas are not a better option because the artificial sweeteners, like aspartame, are neurotoxins (toxic to the brain). In addition, you should abstain from alcohol because it decreases fertility and can have negative consequences on the fetus. Studies are mixed with regard to caffeine, but it has been linked to miscarriage and low birth weight in babies, so use caution. The best thing for you to drink is lots of water. Try adding lemon or cucumber slices for extra flavor.Start preparing nowIt's never too early to prepare yourself for pregnancy and childbirth. The nutritional choices you make now will impact the health of you and your baby. These recommendations may seem overwhelming, and you may be concerned about how to put them into practice. At Nutritional Weight & Wellness, we believe that preparing for pregnancy is one of the best times in your life to meet with one of our nutritionists. Not only will you correct some of your eating habits, but you'll also give your baby the best nutrition possible.

Anorexia and Compulsive Exercise: How I Made the Connection to My Unhealthy Gut

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/anorexia-and-compulsive-exercise-how-i-made-connection-my-unhealthy-gut/,"Anorexia and Compulsive Exercise: How I Made the Connection to My Unhealthy GutBy Jennifer Schmid										September 15, 2015				I suffered from poor digestive health since birth. I was a colicky baby and was on and off antibiotics with bladder and kidney infections until surgery at the age of 12. I thought it was normal to have intestinal pain and problems almost every time I ate, and my IBS symptoms lasted until my late 30s. At that time, I was eating a diet that was high in processed carbohydrates, low fat, and not much protein.In the late 1990s I started to develop an exercise addiction that led to an eating disorder. I was in and out of the hospital and residential facilities for many years. For me, exercising would temporarily ease my intestinal distress as well as create the endorphins I was lacking. It also helped ease my anxiety.I started listening to Dishing Up Nutrition around the time it first started to air. It wasnt until my third major intestinal surgery in 2012, that I decided I needed lifesaving help. I had stopped absorbing most of what I was eating and I was miserable. I was also diagnosed with osteoporosis in the fall of 2012.I made an appointment with a nutritionist at Nutritional Weight & Wellness to address my eating and lifestyle habits. My nutritionist helped me make the connection that my unhealthy digestion was causing my anxiety, exercise addiction and eating disorder. She explained that neurotransmitters, or good brain chemicals like serotonin, are made in the small intestine. I was deficient in those neurotransmitters most of my life.After one month of eating the Weight & Wellness Way and taking supplements to get my intestines to start to heal, I felt drastic improvements in my health (Read my original success story here). I started on a probiotic, which I like to refer to as my BBB defense system. Not the Better Business Bureau, but rather Beneficial Bifido Bacteria. I also started taking l-glutamine which is very healing to the digestive tract. Bone broth has also been healing to my gut. My favorite recipe for that is in the Weight & Wellness Cookbook and Nutrition Guide.I learned that gluten, soy, dairy, sugar, coffee and alcohol were harming my gut. Eventually I stopped eating all grains and legumes as well. I learned that I wasnt drinking enough water and that I need to drink half my body weight in ounces of water per day. I changed to Reverse Osmosis water versus using my Britta-filtered tap water, because elements such as chlorine and fluoride can be damaging to the gut lining. I notice if I am not drinking enough water because I experience intestinal distress, and water eases those symptoms quickly. I learned that due to my surgeries my intestines were not as efficient as they once were. This means that raw veggies, some raw fruits, and raw nuts are no longer an option for me, but I can still enjoy cooked vegetables. The fruits that are tougher to digest I can cook as well, for example stewed apples. Nut butters are also a great way for me to enjoy nuts.Its important for me to get at least 8 hours of sleep. If I get under 7 hours of sleep my digestion suffers. I have learned to avoid stress and the stress of too much exertion as well. My faith, as well as yoga, has been great at helping me with that.I never made the connection that my poor intestinal health could affect my brain health. I was also unaware the antibiotics taken during childhood killed most of my good gut bacteria. Once my gut started to heal, the most exciting changes were in my thoughts and behaviors. The desire to over-exercise, and my anxiety and obsessive-compulsive behaviors diminished. All my eating disorder thoughts and behaviors left. I was so relieved to be able to learn and trace the actual cause of what led to all of these behaviors! All I needed to do was get change my biochemistry by eating real food. The knowledge of the gut-brain connection was the missing puzzle piece for me.The incredible power of good nutritionShortly after meeting with my nutritionist at Nutritional Weight & Wellness, I was driving home from work and started to head to the gym. All of a sudden I thought to myself, I dont have to go to the gym today!!! I drove home crying knowing that I had reached complete freedom. Keep in mind that in the past, nothing would stop me from going to the gym. I used to drive through awful weather (even a blizzard) to get to there. This is when I realized how powerful nutrition is.Now I eat food that is compatible with my body and brain.Eating animal protein 5 times a day has made a tremendous difference in my brain health, which supports my moods. Eating balanced meals 5-6 times a day is key for me. I always think PFC: protein, fats, and carbohydrates in the form of mostly veggies at every meal and snack. I find the fats so important for me to heal all the damage done to my cells over the years.I feel more confident in my clothes, as I restored to a healthy weight and have had no problems maintaining that.In addition to healing my gut, anxiety, compulsive exercising and anorexia, nutrition has healed me in many other ways. I reversed my osteoporosis, my back pain went away, and I can sleep through the night. I feel free, healthier, and happier. I never dreamed that talking to someone about my nutrition would make such a difference in my life.For more information on intestinal health and eating disorders, listen to the September 12, 2015 podcast of Dishing Up Nutrition with special guest Jennifer Schmid. About the authorJennifer battled anorexia and compulsive exercising for more than 20 years. She was considered to be anorexic, but the bigger problem for her was addictive, excessive exercise.

I can relate to you. I never tried to starve myself but I've become very skinny in my thirties due to health problems with a pinched nerve in my neck and a low Vitamin-D level. I've never been good with my eating; either too much or hardly at all. Thanks for sharing your story. I'm trying to get healthy again.

First, I discussed having a specific action plan. Second, I reviewed the perfectionist mentality. Today, lets talk about cheating!Tip 3: Accept the idea that there is no such thing as cheating when it comes to eating, only choicesAnother mind set to grasp is the idea that cheating really is non-existent. There is only choosing. Is this a new thought for you? This is especially true after you are educated and know why certain types of foods are terrible for you.Referring to a behavior as cheating feeds a defeatist attitude, which leads to feeling like a failure, which enables you to give up, which is really the ultimate failure. Along the way, you also have not really owned up to the actual behavior. And you probably know better. We all do.Lets look at how choosing versus cheating can change the outcome for you.Choosing:For example, if you CHOOSE to have a piece of pie, knowing the sugar will cause you pain, the trans fats will decrease your metabolism, the gluten will make your stomach churn and the dairy will make you break out, you have made a conscious decision to live with the consequences of eating the pie. The pie really might be worth it to you (Lets say its your birthday and you really want to eat a slice of pie). The good news is that by making this a conscious decision (I am choosing to eat the pie now) you make it easier to choose to eat a healthy meal or snack AFTER having the pie.Cheating:If you eat the pie and label it as cheating, its much easier to let yourself off the hook and let that cheating mentality snowball to the next meal, the next day, and possibly all the way to next Monday, when you will be good again.The bottom line: Instead of viewing food choices like candy, cake, pastries, etc. as cheating, look at these decisions as choices. Take responsibility for the choice and move on. Make a conscious decision to make a better choice at your next meal or snack and set yourself up for success.Kristen Gunderson, Nutrition Educator, has a double BA in psychology and sociology, with an emphasis in behavior modification.

Female Athletes: Hormonal Concerns and Bone Health

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/female-athletes-hormonal-concerns-and-bone-health/,"Female Athletes: Hormonal Concerns and Bone HealthBy Brenna Thompson, MS, RD, LD										November 4, 2014				Exercise is important for our health, but it can be a double-edged sword. While it has been shown to improve cardiovascular function, sleep, muscle strength, mood, and self-esteem, there is a tipping point. As a runner on the junior and senior high school track and cross-country team, I developed five stress fractures in my tibia bones. Over the course of four years, my doctors fitted me for several different orthotics to use in my running shoes. Their theory was that my flat feet caused the muscles and tendons on my lower legs to pull and stress the tibia bone, leading to the fractures. Around the age of 16, birth control pills were prescribed as a way to increase my estrogen levels, which would help deposit more calcium into my bones and prevent future fractures.What was never discussed was why my estrogen levels might be low in the first place. The phenomenon of young female athletes experiencing multiple stress fractures and hormone imbalances is more common than you might think. This is often true for adult women as well. Athletic women often look fit and healthy, but underneath their vibrant appearance is a serious condition that is just now beginning to be understood.Female athletes often eat too littleFemale athletes are often under pressure to maintain a thin physique, especially if they participate in gymnastics, tennis, volleyball, running, dance or swimming. Junior and senior high school are already stressful enough, having to strut around in a bathing suit or skin-tight shorts adds another self-esteem test. Athletics, staying in shape, and being competitive all seem on the surface to be very positive behaviors for young women, but they can be a double-edged sword. To stay lean and potentially gain an edge over the competition, some girls knowingly restrict their food and may develop an eating disorder such as anorexia or bulimia. Other athletes who are perfectly comfortable in their skin may unknowingly under eat based on their exercise demands. This pattern of under eating may start in adolescence, but it can also continue into adulthood, which often leads to hormone imbalances and altered bone density.Restricted eating and hormone imbalance and the effect on the female athleteRestricted eating leads the body to shut down non-essential processes. During times of stress and starvation, the last thing a woman needs is the added physical stress of carrying a baby. So the body stops producing estrogen and progesterone in order to prevent a pregnancy. Many young female athletes notice that during the in-season time of their sport they lose their menstrual cycle, known as amenorrhea. Many girls think of this as normal, or believe it means they are working harder than their teammates. What they do not realize is that the hormones that normally trigger their menstruation also help their bones absorb calcium, and without those hormones their bones become weak. For many athletes their periods begin again once their sport season has ended. But for teens or women who participate in athletics or workouts year round, or those who actively restrict their diet, their cycles may not return. No matter the scenario, activity levels and calorie intake need to be matched in order for proper hormone cycles to be maintained year round, otherwise they risk developing stress fractures and osteoporosis.Restoring balanceIt is estimated that 78 percent of high school female athletes have one or more components of what is called the Female Athlete Triad, which all starts with under eating for high levels of exercise.Not eating enough, restricted eating or eating disorderAmenorrhea (Loss of menstrual cycle)Low bone densityTo help restore menstruation and promote bone health, the underlying calorie deficit needs to be reversed. For some athletes, focusing on eating more through higher calorie meals and snacks is enough. Other athletes will need to decrease their activity level while also increasing their food consumption. If a woman is struggling with an eating disorder, this needs to be addressed before she continues to exercise. Most women find that their periods return within one to three months of increasing their food consumption, but it can depend upon how long the food deficits and hormone imbalance has been going on.Eating to support exercise, hormones and bonesTeens can be picky, and their hunger cues can be radically different from adults (although some adults are picky too). Some people are not hungry during the early morning and skip breakfast before school or work, leaving them starving by lunch. For athletes in school, unless they have packed some snacks, the current USDA school lunch menu will not provide enough calories, protein, or fat to support their activity levels.Athletes and recreational exercisers of all ages need to fuel their bodies properly with real foods. Whipping up a protein shake is a great way for teenagers and adults to bring breakfast to school or work. Studies show that whey protein increases muscle repair, which is just one reason its a great addition to an athletes smoothie. Finger foods such as deli meat or salami paired with a cut up apple and a small container of peanut butter or cream cheese is another great option that can be eaten on the bus, in the hallway before class, or while doing projects at work. Cereal, bagels, Pop-Tarts, and donuts are not healthy options since these processed carbs rob the body of important bone-building minerals and do not provide healthy fats and proteins to make hormones.In schools, class sizes are so large now that students may only have 10-15 minutes to eat once they get their food. The night before class or in the morning before work, parents can help their teen pack a balanced lunch. A high quality thermos will keep leftover chili, chicken wild rice soup, stir-fry, or meatballs warm for hours.

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/client-success-stories/jennifer-s-s-story/,"Jennifer's Story - 45 Pounds Lost, Chronic Infections Gone*Because everyone is unique, individual results vary.Ill never forget when my mom first told me about Nutritional Weight & Wellness. I was at my grandmas birthday party chatting with family members when my fianc leaned over to my mom and said, Do you realize that Jennifer has ANOTHER ear infection? I would get ear, sinus, tooth, kidney, and bladder infections frequently, and my doctor had me on antibiotics constantly. I was always sick, but my doctor couldnt tell me why. The solution was always more antibioticssometimes two rounds of different types just to kill off one infection. My mom was concerned and told me about the Dishing Up Nutrition radio show. I started listening to the show and making small dietary changes. At this point, I was willing to try anything.Weekly Support to Stay on TrackAfter listening to Dishing Up Nutrition for a while, I decided to take the Weight & Wellness Class Series and get one-on-one nutrition counseling with Katie. The classes provided me with the weekly reminder I needed to stay on track, and Katie was so supportive. If I wasnt ready to make a change that Katie suggested, she would start slowly, but encourage me to make the changes because she knew how much better Id feel. And she always had new ideas for me to try if I felt stuck.My Chronic Infections and Inflammation Are GoneSince taking that class more than one year ago and meeting with Katie, Ive had several health improvements. I havent been sick with any infections or on any antibiotics! The inflammation in my body has gone down. My skin was always upset with hives and acne and was so sensitive to the touch. My face and fingers were puffy, too. After changing my eating, my face and fingers arent swollen any more. Acne, something that Ive struggled with since I was teen, cleared along with the hives. I also noticed that my skin heals quickly now if I get a cut. The decreased inflammation was also noticeable in my joints. Walking up and down stairs was always painful for me. I thought the pain was attributed to my weight, but it was actually the foods I was eating.Improved Digestive HealthMy digestion has turned around completely. I used to be nervous about going out to eat and had to make sure there was a bathroom nearby because Id get terrible diarrhea. Now, thats never an issue for me! I also had to rely on a daily dose of Prilosec to relieve heartburn. I had to take it every night or I would get heartburn. Now, I never worry about it and havent had to take any medication to keep it at bay. Along with all of these amazing changes to my health, I lost 45 pounds*. I would still like to lose more weight, but that will come in time as I continue on my eating plan.To stay on track with my eating, I took the Weight & Wellness Class Series again and then I decided to continue getting weekly support with the Nutrition 4 Weight Loss Program. The weekly classes have been so great for me to stick with my healthy eating plan, stay well and lose weight.I believe so much in the power of nutrition. I am more effective in life. I have the energy to get things done with my two businesses. I can walk places and not be in pain. Im not sick all the time. I have the energy to plan and cook. I recently got married, and my parents commented that I wouldnt have been able to do all this planning when I was sick; they were right. Life was overwhelming before, now its great!*Most people following the Nutrition 4 Weight Loss Program can expect to lose one pound or more per week, but because everyone is unique, individual results vary.

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/client-success-stories/madeline-s-story/,"Madeline's Story - 30 Years of Back Pain Gone*Because everyone is unique, individual results vary.When I think about the 30 years I struggled with back pain, it brings me to tears. I missed out on so much including my daughters college graduation when I ended up in the hospital and my fathers eightieth birthday celebration when I couldnt do anything other than stand up straight and still because I was in so much pain. My back pain ruled my life. When I had back spasms, I couldnt sit, lie down or move; many times I couldnt work. I could only stand still and ride out the pain. I sought out help from chiropractors, acupuncturists, massage therapists, and physical therapists, which provided only temporary relief.Debilitating Back PainMy pain got to be so debilitating that my doctor recommended I have a device implanted in my spine that would trick my body into not feeling the pain. This made no sense to me because I knew it wouldnt solve the cause of my pain. If I could resolve the cause, there wouldnt be any pain. But I had to do something since I was already taking four pain pills per day, and my doctor said that over time I would need even more pain medication to keep the pain away. And because of the back pain, I was only getting two to three hours of sleep each night. The lack of sleep left me feeling anxious and irritable, and my memory was awful. The pain pills caused chronic constipation and heartburn, and my hair was falling out in clumps. Before moving forward with the drastic surgery, I decided to try one more thingnutrition. I figured I didnt have anything to lose.Drug Free and Pain Free in Two MonthsI have been a long-time listener of the Dishing Up Nutrition radio show and decided to make a nutrition counseling appointment. At my first appointment with Dar, I told her my goals were to be drug free and pain free; and within two months, Dar delivered. Dar designed a careful eating plan for me that addressed certain food sensitivities contributing to my pain. Until I came to Nutritional Weight & Wellness, no one had been able to find the source of my back pain, and I had dealt with doctors and all sorts of therapies for over 30 years.I do occasionally miss some of the foods I used to eat such as pizza, bagels, milk and ice cream. But when I think of how much pain I was in and of how far Ive come, its easy for me to pass on eating these foods. My heart breaks when I think back on all the things I missed because of my back pain. I was depressed because of all the pain I was feeling and never want to feel that bad again; no food would ever be worth it.I am now off all of my pain medications and havent had a back spasm in over a year (since I started seeing Dar). I am able to bounce out of bed in the morning after seven hours of pain-free sleep! My anxiety and constipation are gone and my memory is much better. On top of everything, I lost 30 pounds! I wasnt aiming to lose any weight, but its been a nice side effect of the new eating plan. I feel like a new, younger person. It feels wonderful to not hurt anymore!Create Your Own Success Story with Nutrition EducationMadelinewas able toput a stop to years of debilitating back pain with the power of nutrition education and personal support.

This has ominous implications. The formation of the placenta dictates how well the mother will be able to transfer nutrients to the fetus. Further studies are needed to uncover exactly what the long-term effects of diets high in carbohydrates are on the health of newborns.A diet high in grains like wheat will contain phytates that reduce the absorption of valuable nutrients like calcium and zinc. Such a diet will also increase exposure to highly allergenic compounds such as gluten, found in wheat, rye, and barley.Excessive intake of carbohydrates, especially sugar, will weaken immune function. Too many carbohydrates will also increase the damage that stress can do to the body, a fact widely appreciated in critical care medicine.

4 Tricks to Curb Morning Sickness

										While the exact cause of morning sickness is unknown, here are four tricks that I’ve recommended to pregnant women to help alleviate this uncomfortable part of pregnancy.					https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/4-tricks-curb-morning-sickness/

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/articles-and-videos/4-tricks-curb-morning-sickness/,"4 Tricks to Curb Morning SicknessBy Brenna Thompson, MS, RD, LD										April 21, 2016				Forget that idea of eating for two that your best friend enjoyed, some expectant mothers can barely eat for themselves due to morning (or afternoon/evening/all day long) sickness.Are you one of them? If so youre not alone, approximately 50 percent of women experience nausea, vomiting, and food aversions associated with morning sickness. Luckily, most of these symptoms pass after the first trimesterusually. While the exact cause of morning sickness is unknown, here are some tricks that Ive recommended to pregnant clients/friends/sisters, to help alleviate this uncomfortable part of pregnancy.1. If mammas blood sugar aint happy, aint nobody happy Well keep this simple, when your blood sugar crashes, you do too. Keep it balanced by eating small snacks or meals every 1-3 hours. This even means having a snack even before you roll out of bed in the morning. Keep some nuts on your night stand, or some rice crackers and a jar of natural peanut butter. During the day try eating a few bites of yogurt or half an avocado sprinkled with sea salt between meals. Foods with protein and/or fat will help keep your blood sugar better balanced than just eating carbohydrates such as fruit, pretzels or toast.2. Cool downTry to eat cold or room temperature foods. When foods are hot, their flavors and scents (this explains your aversion to the smell of your partners coffee) are enhanced, which can be overwhelming. Instead, focus on having foods that taste best when eaten chilled or at room temperature. Try a crunchy broccoli salad mixed with bacon, grapes and high quality mayonnaise or cottage cheese topped with berries and sunflower seeds. You get the idea. One more easy idea is a balanced protein shake made with whey protein powder, coconut milk, and a small bananaanother great way to have a meal without much fuss.3. Cook when youre wellIf you consistently feel terrible at night, dont wait until then to think about cooking. Prep your meals and snacks in the morning or on the weekend when you are hungry. Store leftovers in the freezer so you can easily thaw something out without too much effort. Or, scratch all of that and enlist the help of others. Maybe your partner prepares a small breakfast of sausage and a baked sweet potato topped with butter or coconut oil to eat in bed or later in the morning when you are feeling hungrier.4. Ice, ice babyAbove all, try to stay hydrated. Dehydration will only make nausea worse and is dangerous for both mom and baby. A big glass of water may not sound very appetizing when your stomach is in knots; instead, suck on ice chips. For a little extra nutrition, combine pomegranate or blueberry juice with canned coconut milk then freeze for a refreshing treat on a hot afternoon. This has nothing to do with ice, but ginger is also known to help calm a queasy stomach, so try sipping on ginger tea when feeling nauseous.For more pregnancy and nutrition information, listen to our podcast: Nutrition for Pregnancy with Laurel Riedel.

",https://www.weightandwellness.com/resources/client-success-stories/nicole-s-story/,"Nicole's Story - 17 Pounds Lost, No Longer Prediabetic*Because everyone is unique, individual results vary.I started the Nutrition 4 Weight Loss Program a bit of a skeptic and I ended as a believer! Ive known about Nutritional Weight & Wellness for many years, hearing their Dishing Up Nutrition program on the radio. I wondered if the Nutrition 4 Weight Loss Program could be any different from other weight loss plans and fully expected that it would just try to sell me something like so many others. After reaching a breaking point with my health, I decided to just try it, and I am so grateful I did. I wasnt being sold just another weight loss program; instead, I got a new lease on life.Like so many other people, Ive struggled some with my weight, healthy eating and moods for most of my life. While it was a struggle, I managed until after my now 3-year-old son was born. When I became pregnant, I was at a good weight. Because I was older (40) and had elevated blood pressure when I conceived, my doctors recommended no exercise and during my third trimester my health took a nose dive. My blood pressure skyrocketed, I couldnt sleep, I had terrible joint pain and major mood swings. I thought this would all subside after giving birth, but it got worse. About a year ago, my doctor said I had prediabetes. After two years of following a doctor-advised eating plan (whole grains, some veggies, lots of fruit and milk), I knew I had to do something else.I finally decided to give Nutritional Weight & Wellness a try. It was the best decision! I love the real food approach; I felt incredible after the 12-week program and continue to feel that way. Giving up grains and sugar were critical for me and eating the Weight & Wellness Way, and I dont even crave grains or sugar. The 12-week result: The redness, puffiness and dryness in my skin is gone. My joint pain disappeared. My allergies are much more under control. Halfway into the class, I had a blood test to check my numbers and my results show I am no longer prediabetic. Additionally, my blood pressure is much more stable. Ive lost more than 11 inches, 17 pounds* and dropped several clothing sizes. And my moods, let me tell you, I am a much more even-tempered person!I also appreciate the benefits this program has had on my family. Since I am the family cook, my son and husband eat mostly like I do. My husband has lost 10 pounds and dropped clothing sizes. My son is eating much less pasta and bread which results in better behavior. I love it!This program has been a life-changer for me. My confidence is back. The old me is back, but an even better version because I have better moods and feel fantastic. Im no longer afraid of food. I know I can maintain my weight and continue to feel good as long as I eat real food. Im on a good path, and I plan to continue.*Most people following the Nutrition 4 Weight Loss Program can expect to lose one pound or more per week, but because everyone is unique, individual results vary.
