 Ask Dr. Sears: Vitamin Overdose,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-vitamin-overdose,"A It's important that your baby get the right amount of vitamins, since your baby needs adequate amounts of these nutrients for optimal growth. It is wise not to give your baby more than the recommended daily allowance—the RDA, also called daily value or DV. Yet, giving your baby an excess of most vitamins will cause no harm. Your baby will only excrete the excess in her urine. (Very high excess doses of vitamin A can be harmful, but only at approximately ten times the RDA.) The label on formula cans and food labels, such as some cereal boxes, list the RDA's of essential nutrients.Here's a rundown of the eleven most common vitamins, and their health benefits:Concerning the formula issue, all commercially available infant formulas contain the recommended amount of vitamins. If your baby gets 32 ounces of formula a day, then she is getting enough vitamins. If, however, she takes less than 32 ounces, a multi-vitamin supplement is recommended. When you start adding solid foods, she will also be getting vitamins from solids. You don't need to worry about her getting too much, as it's nearly impossible for baby to ""overdose"" on too much vitamins from foods.Breastfed babies generally do not need vitamin supplements. There is some new evidence that suggests some breastfeeding babies or their mothers, especially if they are African-American, may need vitamin D supplements during the winter months if they are not exposed to at least ten minutes of sunlight a day. Also infants with nutritional needs for catch-up growth, such as premature infants, usually need vitamin, mineral, and iron supplements for at least the first year.Besides vitamins, it's important that babies get enough minerals in their diet, which is why you will notice that some supplements are listed as a ""multi-vitamin/multi-mineral"" preparation. And one of the most important minerals to be sure your baby gets enough of is iron, especially after six months of age. At this point, babies begin to use up all their extra iron stores from the mothers blood at birth. This is why it's important to always use an iron-fortified formula, and not a ""low iron"" formula. Iron is necessary for your baby to make enough red blood cells. Your doctor will routinely measure your infant's iron levels in her hemoglobin around the nine-month well-baby checkup. Infant cereals are also fortified with vitamins and minerals. So, if your baby is taking 32 ounces of formula plus eating solid foods, you can be reassured that she has a vitamin-sufficient diet."
 Your Vitamin D Treatment for S.A.D.

Maybe!<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=66018553&amp;src=id"" target=""_blank"">Shutterstock</a>Back when I was trying to get pregnant with my first child, I didn't always pay attention to my nutrition. In fact, I wasn't even aware that taking supplemental vitamins before pregnancy was a thing! However, I was aware of that pesky little depression that would take over every so often, especially during the cloudy, cold months of winter. Then it hit me: what if my Seasonal Affective Disorder and fertility issues were related?I asked my OB/GYN if she could check my bloodwork again to see if I had any vitamin deficiencies, and sure enough, my vitamin D levels were too low. She suggested that I take a high-quality vitamin D supplement regularly, and after only a few months of taking it, I felt happier, healthier and even became pregnant! Obviously, not everyone will magically conceive simply by taking extra vitamin D, but if you have a deficiency, it might just help.Vitamin D helps beat the rainy day blues of <a href=""http://www.union.edu/offices/health-counseling/counseling/_forms/seasonal-affective-disorder.pdf"" target=""_blank"">Seasonal Affective Disorder</a> by improving how well your body holds on to its stores of serotonin, the ""good mood"" hormone, but it could also hold the key for many women with fertility issues. In a study conducted by <a href=""http://www.unc.edu/~stumpfwe/VitaminD-Soltriol-1988-histochemistry.pdf"" target=""_blank"">The University of North Carolina</a>, supplemental vitamin D was shown to improve both mental functioning and reproduction. This study claims that without sufficient levels of vitamin D in the body, reproductive tissues were negatively effected and did not function at optimum levels. If you know that you already suffer from Seasonal Affective Disorder, consider looking more closely at your diet and bloodwork before spending a fortune on unnecessary fertility testing.Many women begin by taking the <a href=""http://www.whfoods.com/genpage.php?tname=nutrient&amp;dbid=110#foodchart"" target=""_blank"">average daily requirement</a> of 600 units of vitamin D, which you can likely find in a daily multivitamin. Supplementation for Seasonal Affective Disorder and fertility issues may require a slightly higher dose. However, before you start taking any vitamin supplement, especially vitamin D, always talk to your doctor first. She can let you know exactly how much vitamin D you should take for your specific condition. Certain people should not supplement with extra vitamin D, such as people who have kidney disease, lymphoma or atherosclerosis. Pregnant or lactating women should make sure to keep vitamin D levels below 4000 units per day. However, you can start including more foods high in vitamin D into your diet!Our favorite vitamin D heavy foods include:Remember, always check with your general doctor or OB/GYN before taking supplemental vitamin D.

 Ask Dr. Sears: Is Vitamin Water Safe for Kids?,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-is-vitamin-water-safe-for-kids,"<strong>Q. My 2½-year-old daughter recently asked to try my vitamin water (she liked it and said it ""tasted like Jell-O!""). While I never give her soda or <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">foods</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> with artificial sweeteners, I don't see much harm in letting her have some of this vitamin-enriched water. Are there any pediatric concerns regarding these drinks?</strong> <br><br><strong>A.</strong> The bottom line: Don't waste your money on vitamin water. You're better off serving your child plain bottled water and letting her get vitamins from healthy foods and/or a daily multivitamin. Here's why: <br><br><strong>Vitamins in the water may not be as nutritious as the vitamins in food.</strong> My main concern is that, biochemically, the vitamins in the water may behave differently in the body than vitamins that naturally occur in foods from nature, such as apples or broccoli. Due to a biochemical quirk called synergy, when a food's vitamins and minerals are packaged together, they help one another absorb into the bloodstream more efficiently and function better throughout the body. When, for example, vitamins C and E are eaten together in a food, such as a green leafy vegetable like spinach, the health effect on the body is much greater than when the vitamins are consumed individually as, say, vitamin C in vitamin water. In short, food gives you the whole package of nutrients. Vitamin water gives just a few vitamins and may not be nearly as effective the same ones eaten in foods.<br><br><strong>Let water be water.</strong> One of the most important nutritional principles in childhood health is to shape young tastes. You don't want your child to grow up thinking that drinks should ""taste like Jell-O""  -- in other words that every drink must be colored, flavored, or sweetened. Rather, you want her to develop a taste for plain water. Start now to instill in her the belief that water is a healthy  -- and preferable  -- drink.<br><br><strong>Vitamin water may not be as healthy as you think.</strong> While I don't know which brand of water you drink, I can assume that if it tastes like Jell-O to your child, it's artificially colored and/or sweetened, both of which could be harmful to your child's health. In my opinion, artificial food colorings (such as red #40) have never been proven safe for growing children. In fact, the government categorizes them as GRAS (generally regarded as safe). This translates to: ""We're really not sure!"" Try to restrict not only artificially sweetened beverages but those sweetened with sugar or high fructose corn syrup as well. Researchers believe these beverages are the top cause of childhood obesity in America. In addition, studies have shown that gulping down sweetened beverages can depress the body's immune system, just the opposite of what you hope to achieve from consuming vitamins. <br><br>I'm also concerned that vitamin water may harm the teeth. Medical journals have recently published warnings about acidic beverages eroding dental enamel. Vitamin C (chemically known as asorbic acid), which is generally one of the vitamins added to vitamin water, is acidic, while plain water is not. Another safety concern is the ""drug interactions"" that could potentially occur among the ingredients in these so-called smart beverages. The combination of all these herbs and vitamins have, most likely, never been studied in children. We know that nature safely combines nutrients in fruits and vegetables, but we don't know the safety of combinations put together in a laboratory and then added to a bottle of water. Many nutritionists believe that vitamin water is simply a gimmick, and I tend to agree.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>"
 The Importance of Vitamin D,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-importance-of-vitamin-d,"Your child needs this vitamin to help her body absorb calcium and build healthy bones. Plus, there's mounting evidence that vitamin D reduces the risk of Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and certain cancers. Kids need at least 200 international units a day  -- about two eight-ounce glasses of milk.

The women who had sufficient vitamin D were nearly twice as likely to conceive through their IVF cycle as their deficient counterparts. Women who had vitamin D levels of at least 20 ng/ml in their blood were considered to have sufficient levels of the hormone. Levels of 30 ng/ml are recommended for general health.""Although randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the findings, our results certainly suggest that <a href=""https://www.endocrine.org/news-room/press-release-archives/2014/vitamin-d-deficiency-may-reduce-pregnancy-rate-in-women-undergoing-ivf"" target=""_blank"">low levels of vitamin D contribute to infertility</a>,"" said Alessio Paffoni, MSc, of the Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan, Italy, and one of the study's authors. ""Since vitamin D supplementation is an inexpensive and simple intervention with few relevant side effects, additional study in this area has the potential to markedly influence the way infertility is treated.""But <a href=""http://www.mountsinai.org/profiles/tanmoy-mukherjee"" style=""background-color: initial;"">Dr. Tanmoy Mukherjee</a>, associate director of the Mount Sinai Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and co-director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York, says women shouldn't necessarily run out to grab vitamin D supplements quite yet. Instead, he advises all of his patients, men and women, to take a multivitamin as a part of their fertility protocol. Even if patients have a great diet and lifestyle, a multivitamin insures the body is getting everything it needs to function at the best possible level.If you think your level is low, you can increase your vitamin D by getting out in the sunlight more and eating fortified foods like orange juice or milk. Cheese, egg yolks and fatty fish, like tuna and salmon, are also foods that are high in vitamin D. Don't take supplements in excess of 1000iu per day without first consulting your medical doctor."

 Vitamins for Picky Eaters,http://www.parenting.com/article/vitamins-for-picky-eaters,"I think my 3-year old needs a multivitamin, but what kind is best?First, don't give up on his diet! It can take lots of tries before some kids realize that broccoli, mango, or flounder actually tastes good. Keep putting different foods on his plate. You never know what might happen. That said, most children, including picky eaters, don't need multivitamins if they are getting at least some of all the food groups on a somewhat daily basis, especially meat, vegetables (all colors), dairy, and fruit. If your child isn't, visit your doctor to go over his diet to see if a multivitamin makes sense, and if so, whether to get one with iron.If your pediatrician thinks a vitamin is a good idea but doesn't have a specific brand in mind, you'll have to read labels carefully because nutrient amounts vary between brands. And because most vitamins for kids are designed for ages 4 and up, you'll likely need to split each pill in half for a 3-year-old, not always easy.The good news is that there are all sorts of colors, shapes, and flavors available, designed to tempt the most picky children (though many kids don't like the liquid formulas). In fact, chewable vitamins can be yummy, so you could have another problem, stopping your son from eating more than one. Overdosing can be dangerous; make sure he knows they're not candy, and store them out of reach."
 The Lowdown on Vitamin D,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-lowdown-on-vitamin-d,"<b>Why that's bad:</b> Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, so without enough of it, bones may not develop properly. Researchers are also finding strong links between low D levels and other conditions, most recently Type 1 diabetes, the second most common chronic disease in children.<b>What's going on:</b> Ordinarily, most of the vitamin D we get would come from sun exposure. But the sunscreen we slather on (for good reason!) completely blocks the UVB rays that our bodies convert into D, says James Dowd, M.D., associate professor of medicine at Michigan State University in East Lansing. That leaves us to get D from food, and there aren't many kid-friendly sources. Milk and some cereals, OJs, and yogurts are fortified with D, but not all kids down enough of these. Finally, breast milk has a very low concentration of vitamin D, putting babies who are exclusively breastfed at particular risk.<b>The solution:</b> Some experts are in favor of letting kids older than 6 months soak up some rays sans sunscreen -- 10 to 15 minutes three times a week at midday, except during winter, when the level of UVB rays is insufficient. That said, not all doctors or parents are comfortable with the strategy, given possible risks of sun damage.In that case, supplementation is the other way to go. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that kids get 400 IU of D per day, and specifically recommends a supplement for:"

Avoid simple carbohydrates—found in white sugar, white flour and the foods that contain them (cakes, white bread)—because they are nutritionally empty and fattening.<br>Where: You'll need a whopping nine servings a day, which might come from: 1 slice whole wheat bread, 1 tortilla, 1/2 bagel, 1 ounce cold cereal, 1/2 cup cooked pasta or rice, 1 medium potato, 1/2 cup corn.</br>Why: Fats are an important source of energy, and they help you metabolize vitamins A, D, E, and K. Still, fats supply a lot of calories, so limit them to no more than one-third of your daily count.<br>Where: Have four of the following servings daily: 2 ounces cheese, 2 tablespoons peanut butter, 3/4 cup tuna salad, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon mayonnaise, 3 or 4 ounces lean meat, 1 egg or egg yolk, 1/2 small avocado, 1 tablespoon butter. When cooking, stick to the more healthful unsaturated fats, including olive, canola and peanut oils. Avoid less desirable saturated fats, found in meat and dairy products, as well as palm and coconut oils.</br>Why: <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/the-skinny-on-calcium"">Calcium</a> is critical in building your baby's bones and teeth. If you don't consume enough during pregnancy, the fetus will rob your calcium stores, putting you at risk for bone loss.<br>Where: To get the necessary 1,200 milligrams, consume at least four of the following servings: 8 ounces skim milk, 1 cup raw dark green leafy vegetables (salad greens, broccoli, spinach, kale), 3 to 4 ounces canned salmon or sardines, 3/4 cup cottage cheese, 1 cup yogurt or 1 ounce hard cheese.</br>Why: <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/stephanie-parenting/study-iron-decreases-behavior-problems-low-birth-weight-babi"">Iron</a> is required to make hemoglobin, the red-blood-cell component that carries oxygen through the bloodstream. During pregnancy, more hemoglobin is required to supply your baby with oxygen. And the fetus also uses iron to build its own blood supply.<br>Where: Pregnant women need twice as much iron—about 30 milligrams a day—so your doctor may prescribe a prenatal vitamin that contains iron. You should also try to eat some of the following foods daily: dried fruits, lean red meat, dried beans and pasta, whole-grain breads and dark green leafy vegetables.</br>Why: This nutrient is essential because it helps in the manufacture of collagen, a protein that provides structure to your baby's bones, cartilage, muscles and blood vessels. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant, which means that it helps prevent disease.<br>Where: Your body can't store vitamin C, so it's crucial that you consume the necessary 65 milligrams daily. Get it by eating two to three of the following servings: 1/2 cup citrus-fruit juice, 1/2 grapefruit, 1 medium orange, 1/2 cup cantaloupe, 1/2 cup shredded cabbage or coleslaw, 2/3 cup cooked broccoli, 3/4 cup cooked cauliflower, 1 1/2 large tomatoes.</br>Why: This B vitamin is used to produce the extra blood you and your baby need and helps some enzymes function. Taken before conception and early in pregnancy, folic acid also helps prevent neural-tube defects (which occur when the brain, spinal cord, or their coverings do not form normally) and cleft lip or palate (a gap in the lip or roof of the mouth).<br>Where: Good sources of folic acid include leafy green vegetables, broccoli, asparagus, lean beef, oranges, lentils and peanuts. The FDA now requires that pastas, breads and grains be enriched with folic acid, so be sure to eat plenty of these complex carbs. Your doctor may also prescribe a supplement—0.4 milligram a day for most women, 4.0 milligrams if you are at risk of having a baby with a neural-tube defect.</br>Why: This nutrient is vital to healthy skin, bones, and eyes and helps to create the cells that will make up your baby's internal organs.<br>Where: You'll get all you need each day (800 micrograms) with just four servings of the following: 3/4 cup vegetable juice, 3/4 cup dark yellow vegetables, 8 ounces milk, 1/2 cup cantaloupe, 1 large peach or nectarine, 1 cup dark leafy vegetables. <em>Caution: Excessive levels of vitamin A (over 10,000 IU) can be harmful to you and your baby, so don't overdo it with supplements.</em></br>Why: Vitamin D helps build bone, tissue, and teeth. It also enables your body to use calcium and phosphorus.<br>Where: Your four 8-ounce servings of skim milk are about the best source of the 10 micrograms you need daily. Egg yolks, sardines and canned salmon also provide vitamin D. Or get a little sunshine, which helps your skin manufacture it.</br>Why: This new addition to the must-have pregnancy diet has recently proved to aid fetal growth.<br>Where: You can get the necessary 20 milligrams a day in your recommended amount of whole grains, meat, and milk, as well as oysters, shellfish and other seafood.</br>Why: Water is essential for developing new cells, maintaining blood volume and processing other nutrients. It also minimizes swelling, constipation and your risk of urinary tract infections.<br>Where: Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day, including milk, fruit juices and decaffeinated tea or coffee.</br>"
 Multivitamins for Kids: Do Kids With a Healthy Diet Need One?,http://www.parenting.com/article/multivitamins-kids,"If your child eats a well-balanced, <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">healthy</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> diet, find out if she still needs a daily multivitamin<strong>Q: </strong><em>Does my child need vitamins if she eats a balanced diet?</em><strong>A:</strong> The short answer is no. Even kids who seem to be picky eaters or who don't eat a varied diet usually do a pretty good job of consuming all the important vitamins and minerals they need. So for most children who are otherwise healthy and have no dietary restrictions, a daily multivitamin is probably not necessary.That said, the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends vitamin D supplementation in all infants, whether breast- or bottle-fed, from birth to possibly even adolescence. This is different from the old recommendation to give vitamin D only to breastfed infants. Studies show that toddlers, older kids, and even some adults are vitamin D—deficient and could benefit from supplements. Vitamin D keeps bones strong and healthy, and plays a role in keeping the immune system strong as well.There are also certain groups of kids, such as vegetarians and those with food sensitivities who require a strictly controlled diet, who might benefit from a daily multivitamin. It's a good idea to discuss your child's vitamin D intake, as well as other important nutrients such as calcium and iron, with your pediatrician.One more important point to make about vitamins: They can be toxic when taken in excess. Many are designed to look and taste like candy, and a child who takes more than the recommended daily dose could wind up in the emergency room. So be sure to treat vitamins like any other medication: Always keep them locked up and out of reach.<strong>Lara Zibners, M.D.,</strong> penned <em>If Your Kid Eats This Book, Everything Will Still Be Okay</em>.

 When Pregnancy Tastes Funny,http://www.parenting.com/article/when-pregnancy-tastes-funny,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekThe scoop on the bad taste problem you might <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">experience</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>Most pregnant women expect <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/morning-sickness-101-when-will-it-end"">morning sickness</a> and backaches, but few have heard about dysgeusia, or the ""bad taste problem."" This surprisingly common condition, likely caused by pregnancy hormones, can result in the absence of taste or altered taste, such as a metallic or bitter sensation, says Stacey Nelson, R.D., a senior clinical nutritionist at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston. Here's how you can combat the condition:Marinate meats in vinegar, soy sauce or citrus juices, as sour foods stimulate the taste buds and saliva production. Other ideas: Add lemons to water, drink lemon or lime seltzer and lemonade, or suck on citrus drops. Switching to plastic dinnerware from silverware can also help.If you're sensitive to sweets, add a dash of salt to tone down foods like canned fruits or jam. And opt for savory snacks, such as cheese, peanut butter or olives.Ask your provider about switching to a chewable prenatal vitamin, which may be easier to tolerate.Brush your teeth and tongue, and rinse with a baking soda solution (add 1/4 teaspoon soda to 1 cup water) which improves taste by neutralizing pH levels.Don't feel guilty if healthy foods turn you off, says Nelson. Most taste changes will dissipate by the second trimester, when you can reintroduce them. If you're worried that your food aversions are resulting in poor nutrition, talk to your health care provider. "
 Ask Dr. Sears: Whole or Two Percent?,http://www.parenting.com/article/whole-or-two-percent,"<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=121853818&amp;src=id"" target=""_blank"">Shutterstock</a><strong><span class=""grey16b"">A:</span></strong> <span class=""grey10"">Your pediatrician is correct. As babies grow into toddler years, most do not need the extra fat of whole milk and do just fine with two percent milk. Yet the question of when to switch from whole to low-fat milk depends upon your toddler's overall nutrition. In my pediatric practice, I usually wait until two years of age to switch a toddler from whole milk to two percent milk. The reason why has more to do with toddlers' temperament rather than developmental needs: Most toddlers are picky eaters and need the extra fat for extra calories.</span>If your toddler has an overall balanced diet, then <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/sasha-emmons/skim-milk"">switching to two percent milk is fine</a>. As your pediatrician mentioned, low-fat and whole milk have equal amounts of vitamins and minerals. In fact, an 8-ounce glass of low-fat milk contains more protein than an 8-ounce glass of whole milk (10 grams versus 8 grams). Whole milk contains 3.5 to 4 percent fat, and this extra fat is primarily saturated fat, which your toddler can do without. But your growing toddler still needs fat in his diet. That is why I do not advise giving skim milk to infants and toddlers.Toddlers are picky eaters for two reasons: They have tiny tummies (about the size of their fist), and toddlers don't like to sit still for anything, let alone to eat. Fat provides twice as many calories per gram as do carbohydrates and proteins. Also, healthy fats are a necessary component of the vital tissues—especially the brain and central nervous system—that are growing so fast in your toddler. So, when you switch to two percent milk, you must add other healthy fats to your baby's diet.As you make changes to your child's diet, I'd like you to remember my guide for toddler feeding: Feed your toddler a <em>right-</em>fat and not a low-fat diet. The best fats for babies are omega-3 fats, found in oily, coldwater fish, primarily salmon. Seafood fats (especially wild salmon) are the healthiest fats for growing children—and for adults for that matter. Other healthy fats are flax oil (2-3 teaspoons a day mixed in oatmeal or a smoothie), olive oil (2-3 teaspoons a day) and nut butters (a tablespoon a day). Best to wait until two before introducing peanut butter, especially if there is a strong family history of food allergies. Almond butter is usually a safer alternative.Pediatricians and nutritionists agree that one of the most unhealthy trends in the past 20 years is children switching from milk to sweetened beverages. It's important to reverse that trend and encourage your child to drink more water and milk and less sugar-sweetened beverages. The best thing about milk is that it is power-packed nutrition for typically picky eaters. An 8-ounce glass of milk contains 8-10 grams of protein and 300 milligrams of calcium—that's 35 percent of the daily value (DV) for children. It also has half of the DV for vitamin B-2, 30 percent of the DV for B-12, ten percent of the DV for zinc, 25 percent of the DV for vitamin D and ten percent of the DV for vitamin A. By comparison, an 8-ounce can of soda contains none of this.In order to remember the different types of milk to give your children at different ages, I give my patients the following guide:"
 Healthy Drinks for Kids,http://www.parenting.com/article/healthy-drinks-kids,"What your kids drink is as big a part of nutrition as what they eat. Here's what they should be sipping to stay <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">healthy</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>What kid wouldn’t want to try your fizzy pink soda or foamy vanilla latte? While a taste here and there isn’t a big deal, it’s best to stick with the classics when it comes to daily drinks: milk, a little juice…and lots of plain ol’ water. Babies get most of the fl uids they need during the first year from breast milk or formula. But water is best for keeping kids older than 1 hydrated and healthy, and staving off fatigue, muscle weakness and headaches. “Developing a taste for water is important because kids who consume too many sweetened beverages may come to expect that every drink should be sugary,” explains Nicolas Stettler, M.D., an associate professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition.Here, the lowdown on all things liquid, and how often your child should sip:Give whole milk to kids ages 1 to 2 (unless there’s a family history of obesity or heart disease, in which case reduced-fat milk can be considered, but talk with your pediatrician first). Fat-free milk is best after age 2; it has all the vitamin D and calcium your child needs, without the added calories.As needed, depending on activity level, climate and weight . No H2O fans in your house? Try flavoring it with crushed berries , or decorate it with funny straws or ice cubes.If you decide to offer one, choose a drink that’s sugar-free. Just know that these are simply tinted water with added vitamins (which kids usually get enough of in their regular diet).Serve only 100 percent juice, without added sugar. Kids ages 1 to 6 years can have four to six ounces a day. “Too much adds a lot of calories and not as much fi ber as a piece of fruit,” says Dr. Stettler.Soda is basically liquid candy, offering <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/melanie-parentingcom/kids-should-avoid-energy-and-sports-drinks-says-aap"">nothing of nutritional value.</a> And caffeine (in coffee, tea and most energy drinks) is a stimulant —plus, it’s addictive. “For a special occasion, a bit of soda is fine, but it shouldn’t be something kids drink with any regularity,” says Dr. Stettler."
 The Savvy Mom's Guide to Sun Safety,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-savvy-moms-guide-to-sun-safety,"Exposed! The 6 most common sun mythsJodie Griggs / Getty Images<span class=""blue10b"">Reality:</span> While even one sunburn may double the chance of eventually developing melanoma (the most serious type of skin cancer), your kids are still at risk even if they never burn. ""The more sun you get, the more likely you are to develop certain skin cancers,"" says Martin Weinstock, M.D., chairman of the American Cancer Society's (ACS) Skin Cancer Advisory Group, no matter what your skin tone. ""Any tan indicates damage to your skin.""<span class=""blue10b"">Reality:</span> It's not foolproof. Sand reflects 17 percent of UV radiation, so you're still exposed, says Dr. Weinstock. Nevertheless, it's smart to stay in the shade when the sun's rays are high; just make sure you're also slathered with sunscreen.<span class=""blue10b"">Reality:</span> Glass filters out only one kind of radiation  -- UVB rays. But UVA rays, which penetrate deeper, can still get through. That's why many adults have more freckles on their left side than their right  -- it's from UV exposure on that side through the car window when driving. To protect yourself, apply sunscreen to any exposed areas (like your hands, forearms, and face) before getting into your car, especially in the spring and summer months, says Anthony Mancini, M.D., head of pediatric dermatology at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago. If you're buying a new car, consider one with tinted windows, which keep out almost four times more UVA light than regular ones. You don't need to worry about putting on sunscreen when indoors unless you or your child spends most of your time near a window (for example, if your child's desk is right next to one).<span class=""blue10b"">Reality:</span> You may have read that extra exposure to sunshine is needed to help your body make vitamin D. But according to the ACS, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), and the Skin Cancer Foundation (SCF), both kids and adults get plenty of this nutrient through multivitamins, vitamin D-rich foods (like milk and fortified orange juice), and everyday sun exposure. Also, even if you're wearing sunscreen, small amounts of UV rays still penetrate your skin, and that's more than enough to help your body produce vitamin D.<span class=""blue10b"">Reality:</span> According to the SCF, up to 80 percent of the sun's UV rays can pass through clouds. This is the reason people often end up with serious sunburns on overcast days if they've spent time outside with no sun protection. Even in the winter months, you need to beware: Snow can reflect up to 80 percent of UV rays, increasing exposure. This is especially true if your family's on a ski vacation  -- the higher your altitude, the greater your UV exposure.<span class=""blue10b"">Reality:</span> Contrary to previous estimates, recent studies show that we get less than 25 percent of our total lifetime sun exposure before age 18. That means you get the majority of it later on. So while you absolutely should be vigilant about protecting your kids, make sure you take care of yourself, too. While 83 percent of parents arm their kids with sunscreen and protective clothing whenever they're outdoors, only two-thirds practice what they preach, according to a 2005 AAD survey. ""Remember, kids don't always pay attention to what you say  -- it's more about what you do,"" says Dr. Weinstock. ""If you're making them wear sunscreen but baking yourself, you're sending them a mixed message they may carry into adulthood.""Think that T-shirt protects your kid from UV rays? Think again. A white T-shirt has an SPF of about 7, but once it gets wet, SPF drops down to about 3, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation.""In general, the easiest way to test if a fabric can protect your skin is to hold it up to the light  -- if you can see through it, then UV radiation can penetrate it,"" says Dr. Weinstock. This means you need to apply sunscreen underneath the clothes (and don't forget wide-brimmed hats to shield the face and eyes). Also consider using a laundry aid such as SunGuard, which blocks about 96 percent of UV rays when washed into regular clothes.You might also try some treated SPF clothing. A few of our favorites: <a href=""http://www.cabanalife.com/"" onclick=""window.open('','popup1','height=800,width=600,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')"" target=""popup1"">Cabana Life</a>Is your child at risk? Between 1973 and 2001, childhood melanoma cases increased almost 3 percent every year. The good news is that melanoma in kids is still rare: In children under 10, the incidence is one in a million. ""There's no need to be alarmed by every skin imperfection in your child, but if you have a family history, your child is fair and/or has a lot of moles, make sure she gets skin exams with a dermatologist,"" says Susan Chon, M.D., assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston."
 Your Top Food Questions Answered,http://www.parenting.com/article/your-top-food-questions-answered,"If I were to add up all the minutes I spend talking with patients' parents about different topics, there's no doubt which one would win: feeding. Every relative and her neighbor has advice, much of it contradictory (start with vegetables versus start with fruits, babies need teeth for table food versus no, they don't). And everyone seems certain she's right. Plus, the news is so full of nutritional directives that it can be dizzying. We feel judged as parents based on the eating habits of our children, and we want so much for them to <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">eat well</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> and grow well; it's hard not to feel overwhelmed trying to figure out how best to feed them.Thirteen years of parenting and doctoring have taught me a lot about feeding kids --enough to help parents relax and even enjoy the process. Here, answers to some of the questions I'm asked most: <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Claire McCarthy, M.D., a pediatrician at the Martha Eliot Health Center, in Boston, is on the faculty of Harvard Medical School. She is the author of</span> Learning How the Heart Beats: The Making of a Pediatrician  <span style=""font-style: italic;"">(Penguin)</span>.<strong>Q. When should I start my baby on solids?</strong><strong>A.</strong> The most common mistake is to start too early. Which I can understand --getting out the spoon and watching your child do the baby-bird thing with her mouth can be lots of fun. My husband and I looked forward to it with each of our children (now 13, 11, 6, and 3). Many moms and dads are told by friends and family that their baby will sleep better when she's on solids too, and, of course, what new parent isn't dying for more shut-eye?But babies aren't ready for solids until 4 to 6 months. They aren't ready developmentally and could choke on the simplest of foods. And their intestines can't handle anything more complicated than breast milk or formula. Introducing solids too early may also be linked to later food allergies and eczema.Your baby's ready for her first taste of solid food when she can hold her head up easily and sit well with support --by that I mean she shouldn't slump down into a ball if you put her in an infant seat. She should also have some clue as to what to do with a spoon and its contents. If she doesn't seem much interested, sticks out her tongue a lot while you feed her, doesn't swallow the food, or gets fussy, she may need a little more time. Don't mix the food in the bottle; wait until she's ready to take it from a spoon.If there's a strong family history of food allergies --at least one parent has or had them, and perhaps a sibling as well --it's best to wait until 6 months and to talk to your doctor about which foods to avoid.When you do begin, keep it simple; that's the other common mistake people make. Once, I saw a mother giving her 4-month-old part of a hamburger! While going that fast is rare, it's easy to get excited and move beyond what's good for your baby. Rice cereal mixed with breast milk or formula is a good place to begin because you can easily adjust the consistency to what your baby can handle. After that, go ahead and introduce single-ingredient foods (you can make your own --just don't add salt, sugar, or spices, and be sure to strain out any lumps). Allow a few days between each new food while you watch for such reactions as rashes, diarrhea, vomiting, and fussiness.<strong>Q. My 2-year-old could eat Cheerios for all three meals --in fact, he sometimes does-and he refuses to eat vegetables. What should I do?</strong><strong>A.</strong> My second child, Zachary, was exactly the same way starting around age 2. It caught me off guard, since his older sister, Michaela, loved vegetables and was open to new foods. I thought I had this whole teaching-kids-to-eat-well thing down, and was feeling proud of myself, until Zack came along and reminded me to be more humble.Food jags and flat-out refusing certain foods are quite common in older toddlers and preschoolers. Fighting them head-on is likely to lead to frustration --for you and your child --and some incredibly unpleasant mealtimes. Creativity and patience are better tactics.Creativity can mean playfulness --broccoli forests, sandwiches cut with cookie cutters, or making silly faces with food on the plate. It can also mean being a little sneaky, doing things such as pureeing vegetables and putting them into sauces or soup. Kids like dipping, so setting out some ranch dressing or other dips may help the vegetable cause. Involving your children in cooking --they can help pick recipes, stir, and get ingredients for you --may make them more interested in eating as well.If nothing works, just keep offering vegetables and other foods. One day your child may surprise you (Zack did in elementary school, when he suddenly started to eat salad). In the meantime, speak with your pediatrician about giving your son a chewable multivitamin with iron.<strong>Q. My 7-month-old wants to eat what we're eating at dinnertime. Is it okay to give her some?</strong><strong>A</strong> It depends --on her eating, development, and what you're having for supper. Most babies become ready for table foods between 6 and 9 months. If she's been eating baby foods well and hasn't had any reactions, it's okay to begin broadening her horizons. If she's shown any signs of a food allergy (such as rashes and vomiting), consult your doctor before making forays into table foods.Start with things that are soft and easy for her to gum, such as mashed potatoes (or other cooked veggies --mashing them with the back of a fork usually works well), finely shredded chicken, and rice. (By the way, babies don't actually need teeth to eat these --they can do remarkably well without them.) If she gags or chokes, wait a month before trying again. Once she can manage the table foods you give her, she may be ready to try feeding herself. She should be able to sit well enough to graduate from an infant seat to a high chair and have at least a beginning ability to pick up small things with her fingers.Foods should be cut into bite-size pieces and be as mushy as possible. Try overcooked pasta, Cheerios, pieces of baked or boiled potato, bits of banana, and well-cooked beans. Avoid the following, which are high on the most-choked-upon list: sliced cooked carrots (they can block little windpipes if cut horizontally --dice them small instead), raw carrots, nuts, popcorn, hot dogs, grapes, raisins, and round candies.Be wary of teething biscuits; chunks that are big enough for a child to choke on can break off when mixed with saliva. The same goes for bagels and big pretzels. I once had to do a Heimlich maneuver in the grocery store when Michaela choked on a piece of a big pretzel she was sucking on. It's no fun learning lessons that way!<strong>Q. Should I give my preschooler vitamins?</strong><strong>A</strong>. Probably not, maybe yes. The vast majority of kids older than a year who eat at least a little bit of most foods, including meat, don't really need vitamins. (Younger children should take vitamins or iron only if prescribed by their doctor.) However, kids aren't always so obliging, and some diets may need to be supplemented.As I said earlier, if you've got a picky eater who's living off Cheerios, plain pasta, and not much else, a multivitamin with iron may be a good idea. Children on a vegetarian diet may have trouble getting enough iron, B vitamins, and zinc, so they, too, are likely candidates for a multi with iron.If you give your child vitamins, read the package carefully, as kids' formulations are generally geared for a certain age (usually not under 2) and the dose varies by brand-your child's dose might be half a tablet of one brand and a full one of another. Liquid preparations are available for kids under 2.Look for a multivitamin with calcium, since many kids these days don't get enough of that in their diet. It's always a good idea to read labels because the amount of different vitamins and minerals can vary significantly from one brand to another.Infants and toddlers who nurse a lot (so that the bulk of the milk they get is breast milk) and older children who drink less than 16 ounces of milk each day should take vitamin D. Some children may also need fluoride (after 6 months of age), depending on your water supply. Check with your pediatrician for recommendations based on your child's diet.A cautionary note on vitamins: Some of them taste as good as candy. Always keep them out of reach --taking too many can be dangerous.<strong>Q. My mother says that my 18-month-old daughter is too thin. Should I try to get her to eat more?</strong><strong>A.</strong> I hear this one a lot. Many grandmothers like chubby grandbabies; there's something about those rolls of fat that spells health to them. Unfortunately, rolls of fat aren't healthy and can lead to trouble down the road.Of course, if you also think that your child looks too thin, or if she's been having any symptoms of illness (like fever, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomachache), take her to the doctor to be weighed and measured. But if she's healthy, her appetite is good, her clothes are getting steadily too small, and she's got plenty of energy, you simply may need to tune out your mother (easier said than done, I realize).As a pediatrician, I see the unnerving trend of childhood obesity played out in my office day after day, and I've learned that healthy eating habits need to start very early. Breastfeeding can help. Experts think breastfed babies regulate their food intake to their hunger better than bottle-fed babies; there's no ""Come on, baby, finish your bottle"" phenomenon. Keep the same thing in mind for toddlers and older kids. If they don't want to clean their plate, fine. Let your child listen to her body. It can make a big difference in the prevention of overeating later on.As the one who introduces food to your child, you have a never-again opportunity to put your own ""spin"" on healthy foods. If you present fruits and vegetables as treats, your child will grow up thinking they are. If you don't have soda or potato chips in the house, your child won't get a taste for them. If you introduce skim milk early (but not before age 2 --growing brains need the fat until then), your child will think that skim is how milk should taste. My husband and I did that, and whenever Michaela was offered whole milk, she'd ask to have it watered down!Remember, too, that no matter what we say, it's what we do that our kids really watch. If you have a healthy diet, chances are much better that your child will too.<strong>Q. My 15-month-old won't let me feed him --but when he feeds himself most of it ends up all over the place. What can I do?</strong><strong>A.</strong> There's only one solution: Get a dropcloth! An old shower curtain or vinyl tablecloth, or even a large towel, will do the trick. (Dogs work well too.) What your son is doing is developmentally appropriate; he should be congratulated for his initiative.This stage is messy (I have a stash of photos I plan to whip out at four wedding-rehearsal dinners), but it's fun. My kids were hilarious as they dove into their food --sometimes literally --and it was great to see the pride on their faces when they actually managed to spear that pesky bit of pasta with a fork or get that spoon to their mouth while it still had corn in it. Keep your child in a high chair rather than at the table --finger painting with tomato sauce is better done there, since you can hose it down later. There's something about bowls and plates, too, that invites throwing them to the floor. Putting food right on the tray may be best until the Gravity Game becomes less interesting. Don't give your child a lot at once. And don't worry about him eating enough. He'll let you know if he's still hungry.There will indeed come a day when you aren't down on the floor wondering if anything at all got into your child's mouth.  "

When the babies turned about 16 months old, the researchers revisited the toddlers to examine their teeth. The toddlers whose mothers had low prenatal vitamin D levels had <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/toddler/health/breastfeeding-longer-2-years-linked-to-child-tooth-decay"">more cavities</a>.After the release of this study, you might think that doctors will recommend vitamin D supplements more often during prenatal care, but it's too early to tell. <a href=""http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/04/21/us-low-vitamin-toddlers-idUSBREA3K0X820140421"" target=""_blank"">Doctors generally have been split</a> on taking vitamin D pills during pregnancy. Some doctors believe vitamin D supplements should be recommended to expecting mothers and their levels should be tested during pregnancy. But others shy away from recommending additional supplements during pregnancy, instead choosing to encourage mothers to stimulate vitamin D production naturally by spending more time in the sun and eating certain foods, such as mushrooms and eggs.Either way, talk to your OB/GYN about this new study to see how it might affect you and your unborn child.

 A Booster For Baby Bones,http://www.parenting.com/article/a-booster-for-baby-bones,"<b>Start supplementing before your baby is 2 months old.</b> Begin by giving him at least 200 international units (IU) of vitamin D each day. Your pediatrician can help you determine the right time to begin supplementation; some nursing babies may need a month or two to adjust to breastfeeding before learning to accept a dropper. (A formula-fed baby only needs a supplement if he's not drinking 17 ounces a day by 2 months.)Though 200 IU per day is the recommended amount, vitamin D is currently only available in multivitamin drops that contain 400 IU of vitamin D per milliliter. Rest assured, there is no harm in giving 400 IU per day.<b>Avoid direct sun exposure.</b> Even though sunlight can boost your baby's vitamin D intake, it's important that you protect her skin from ultraviolet light. There's evidence now suggesting that the younger the age at which a child is first exposed to direct sunlight, the greater the risk of developing skin cancer later in life. The AAP recommends that infants younger than 6 months be kept out of direct sunlight and that older babies be protected with clothing and sunscreen."

 The 5 Nutrients All Babies Need,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-5-nutrients-all-babies-need,"The best food for baby's <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">health</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>, and how to get them to eat it<strong>IRON</strong><strong>Why babies need it<br/></strong>Iron is critical for brain development -- research shows a lack of this mineral can lead to thought-processing and motor deficiencies. The good news is that infants are born with large iron stores, usually enough to satisfy their needs until 4 to 6 months of age. Premature babies, however, may miss out on some or all of the significant iron accumulation that occurs during the last trimester of pregnancy. This, coupled with their ""catch-up"" growth rates, may deplete their supply by two to three months. If your baby was born early, ask your pediatrician if she needs an iron supplement.<strong>Daily dose<br/></strong>Formula meets iron needs for the first year, but breast milk doesn't, which is why pediatricians recommend introducing high-iron food early on in the second half of the first year, when you start your baby on solid foods (just remember to always finely chop round, firm foods until your child is 4 to avoid choking hazards). At 7 to 12 months, babies need 11 milligrams of elemental iron per day, and by 1 to 3 years old, 7 milligrams daily.<strong>Serve it up<br/></strong>After your baby is 6 months old, two servings of iron-fortified baby cereal (one-half ounce each) provide the 11 milligrams your baby needs, so make cereal your go-to first solid food. Meat, poultry and fish are naturally iron-packed; try giving ground beef or turkey, chicken and halibut to your little eater. Other rich sources include avocado, baked potato, broccoli, chickpeas, eggs, prunes, soybeans and spinach.<strong>Good to know<br/></strong>Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency among U.S. children. To prevent it, make sure your pediatrician screens your baby for iron-deficiency anemia at 12 months and 18 months.<strong>CALCIUM</strong><strong>Why babies need it<br/></strong>This mineral helps children achieve peak bone mass, necessary for building strong bones and preventing fractures when they start climbing trees and playing sports.<strong>Daily dose<br/></strong>Breast milk and formula meet your baby's calcium needs for the first year. Once you switch to whole milk, your baby will need 500 milligrams daily.<strong>Serve it up<br/></strong>A cup of whole milk or 6 ounces of yogurt each provides about 250 milligrams, making both bone-building powerhouses. Babies under age 1 shouldn't have cow's milk, but yogurt is typically fine once you introduce solids. Other good choices are cheese, salmon, calcium-fortified orange juice, tofu, broccoli, white beans, tomatoes and oatmeal.<strong>Good to know<br/></strong>Helping your baby develop a taste for low-fat dairy will serve him well when he gets close to puberty and his calcium needs soar (1,300 milligrams a day at age 9!), since calcium is absorbed best from food. Babies who are overweight and at risk for obesity, or who have a strong family history of early-onset cardiovascular disease, can have reduced-fat 2 percent milk between 12 and 24 months.<strong>ZINC</strong><strong>Why babies need it<br/></strong>Besides having a positive effect on cognition and development, zinc's primary roles are to maintain immune function and assure optimal cell growth and repair. Zinc deficiency is associated with impaired growth, increased susceptibility to infection and an increased risk of diarrhea.<strong>Daily dose<br/></strong>Formula meets needs through age 1, but breast milk doesn't, so it's important to introduce zinc-rich foods in the second half of the first year. Children from 7 months to 3 years of age need 3 milligrams a day.<strong>Serve it up<br/></strong>Three ounces of pork tenderloin has 2 milligrams, a cup of yogurt has 1.6 milligrams, and half a chicken breast has 1 milligram. Other good sources include turkey, beef, fish, eggs, lentils, whole milk, cheddar cheese and fortified cereal.<strong>Good to know<br/></strong>Zinc is most commonly found in iron -- rich meat, poultry and fish, so if you're meeting your baby's iron needs, chances are she's getting enough zinc too.<strong>VITAMINS A, D, E, AND K</strong><span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Why babies need them</span> <br>Vitamin A promotes proper vision and healthy skin. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption and helps with bone growth -- a deficiency can cause bone-weakening rickets. Vitamin E's antioxidant powers facilitate cell growth and the development of the nervous system. Vitamin K helps with normal blood clotting.</br><strong>Daily dose<br/></strong>A shot of vitamin K is administered to newborns at birth to help prevent bleeding into the brain. Infant formula meets needs through age 1 for vitamins A, D and E. To get enough vitamin D, breastfed babies should take a supplement, such as Tri-Vi-Sol (which also contains vitamins A and C), that provides 400 IU of vitamin D daily until they are weaned from the breast or are taking 15 or more ounces of formula daily. Otherwise, if you offer your baby a variety of foods from the food pyramid -- fruits, vegetables, dairy, whole grains, healthy fats -- and your doctor says she is growing appropriately for her age, she is likely meeting her needs for these fat-soluble vitamins.<strong>Serve it up<br/></strong>Beyond breast milk, formula and cow's milk, good sources of vitamin A include carotene-rich fruits and vegetables such as carrots, sweet potatoes and broccoli. Vitamin D occurs in few foods -- which is why the AAP recommends a daily supplement for breastfed babies -- but your baby can get some from fortified cow's milk, egg yolks and fish. Vitamin E-rich foods include vegetable oils, cereals and grains. Cow's milk, leafy vegetables, fruit and soybean oil are full of vitamin K.<strong>Good to know<br/></strong>A recent study found that 40 percent of infants and toddlers have low levels of vitamin D, which can weaken bones. Make sure you talk to your pediatrician about starting your baby on a vitamin D supplement if you are breastfeeding.<strong>VITAMINS C AND B<br/></strong><strong>Why babies need them<br/></strong>Vitamin C improves iron absorption and helps prevent scurvy, a condition that causes large bruises on the body. B vitamins, including folic acid, enhance the immune and nervous systems, maintain healthy skin and muscle tone, promote cell growth and regulate metabolism.<strong>Daily dose<br/></strong>If you offer your baby a variety of foods from the food pyramid -- fruits, vegetables, dairy, whole grains, healthy fats -- and your doctor says she is growing appropriately for her age, she is likely getting enough of these water-soluble vitamins.<strong>Serve it up<br/></strong>Vitamin C is in citrus, tomatoes, strawberries, cantaloupe and potatoes. Folic acid is in green vegetables, and fortified cereals and breads. The other B vitamins are found in whole grains like brown rice as well as in bananas, beans, eggs, meat, poultry and fish. Good to know: Don't give up on the green stuff or other nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables! Most toddlers have to try a food -- as in, put it in their mouths and spit it out -- an average of eight to 10 times before they start to like it."
 Mealtime Makeovers,http://www.parenting.com/article/mealtime-makeovers,"A child's <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">diet</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> is a work in progress. Just when you think you've figured out what he'll eat  -- and won't  -- his preferences change all over again.So you wonder whether he's eating well enough. As a mother of three, I wonder the same thing. But as a registered dietitian, I know that even if a kid turns up his nose at vegetables, refuses to drink milk, or won't touch any meat except chicken nuggets, it rarely spells dietary doom. Chances are, your child's eating habits are healthier than you think, even if they could use some improvement.That's what three families found when they participated in our diet makeovers. We asked the parents to write down everything their kids ate for three days. Then we compared each child's average daily nutritional intake against what's recommended by age and found kid-approved ways for him or her to eat better.<em>Registered dietitian Elizabeth Ward's latest book is </em>Healthy Foods, Healthy Kids.<em> </em><em>Janet Zalewski marvels at her 2-year-old's energy level. ""I always wonder whether Sarah's eating enough,"" says the Chicago mom. Although she's encouraged by her toddler's curiosity about food  -- ""Like my husband, Mike, she'll try anything once""  -- she worries when Sarah sometimes won't eat what she's served. ""If she doesn't like what I make, should I offer other foods that I know she'll eat?"" It also bothers her that Sarah loves fatty foods, especially salami, hot dogs, and sausages. ""Since I'm always sure she'll eat them, I keep hot dogs in the house for a quick and easy meal,"" admits Zalewski. (To prevent choking in kids younger than 4, cut hot dogs and sausages into small pieces  -- and avoid hard candies like M&amp;M's.)</em><em><strong>Problems  -- and solutions.</strong> Sarah drinks milk at most meals and likes ice cream and yogurt, so she's well nourished in calcium and protein. But all those hot dogs and other processed meats give her too much heart-unhealthy saturated fat and sodium  -- without providing enough iron. Switching to leaner cuts of pork and beef will reduce the fat, boost iron, and lower her intake of potentially harmful sodium nitrite. Other good iron sources: eggs and iron-fortified ready-to-eat cereals.</em><em>Sarah could also benefit from boosting her intake of dietary fiber. For example, she could, as often as possible, switch from white to whole-wheat bread, from french fries to baked potatoes, and from juice to whole fruit.</em><em>There's no need for Sarah's mom to cater to her food preferences; she just needs to continue to offer a variety of nutrient-rich foods. Left to their own devices, 2-year-olds eat when they're hungry, consuming more during growth spurts, which occur less frequently than when they were babies. And Sarah's a remarkably consistent and interested eater for her age.</em><em><strong>One month later.</strong> Sarah's eating fewer processed meats and more tuna fish, eggs, and PB&amp;J and grilled cheese sandwiches. Zalewski switched her from white to whole-grain breads for toast and sandwiches. She's boosting Sarah's fruit (and fiber) intake with a few fruit smoothies a week. A tougher challenge: limiting juice consumption. ""We're both working on it,"" she says.</em><em> </em><em><strong>Breakfast</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em>   <em><strong>Lunch</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em>     <em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em> <em><strong>Dinner</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em>   <em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em> <em>Like his younger brother, 1-year-old Daniel, Fernando still drinks milk from a bottle, yet he's mastered drinking from a cup. ""Even though we don't think he eats a lot,"" says Ignacio, ""his doctor says he's doing fine.""</em><em><strong>Problems  -- and solutions.</strong> Fernando's not hungry because he drinks too much! He consumes 18 ounces of whole milk (often with cereal added) from the bottle every day  -- plus lots of fruit juice and soft drinks. Frequent snacking with large portions  -- a big bowlful of Goldfish (270 calories) plus a cup of Gatorade (60 calories)  -- also suppresses his mealtime appetite. Over time, this dietary pattern could contribute to a weight problem.</em><em>Fernando eats fast-food hamburgers frequently, which helps him meet his dietary needs for iron and zinc, and all that milk gives more than twice the necessary calcium. But the high-fat foods give him too much saturated fat, not to mention excess protein and calories. It's time to break the bottle habit, for developmental as well as dental reasons; later, he can switch to low-fat milk. Eating smaller, more nutritious snacks (such as whole-wheat pretzels or half a sandwich on whole wheat) would help enhance nutrition without squelching his desire for meals.</em><em><strong>One month later.</strong> Fernando's off sugary soft drinks and downs no more than about four ounces of juice (a half cup) twice a day. Instead of chips and crackers, he snacks on child-size portions of yogurt. He's also eating more whole-grain cereals. His appetite at mealtime has improved.</em><em>Breaking the bottle habit will have to wait until the Platas return from a long overseas vacation  -- Fernando's parents don't want to try such a big change until they're back home. He's also still very fond of high-fat fast-food meals.</em><em> </em><em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Breakfast</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Lunch</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Dinner</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em>The family's culinary open-mindedness has a downside: Adrian relies on an ever-changing menu. He's a fickle customer. Says Hale, ""It's tough to keep up  -- I never know what he'll reject next.""</em><em><strong>Problems  -- and solutions.</strong> Variety gives Adrian a big nutritional boost: He gets plenty of iron and zinc even though he takes in fewer calories than suggested for his age. (Because Adrian's growing properly, calories aren't an issue.)</em><em>More milk would give him more calcium and vitamin D. Since plain milk isn't his favorite, he could try low-fat chocolate milk and smoothies made from low-fat milk and fruit. Cheese and calcium-fortified orange juice are also good choices, although they lack vitamin D. Adrian could eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, though he still does better than most kids.</em><em><strong>One month later.</strong> Adrian has doubled his whole-grain consumption and cut his juice intake by half. When he does drink juice, it's often orange juice with added calcium. Fortified drinkable yogurt has supplied some missing calcium and vitamin D. Adding chocolate bumped up Adrian's milk intake for a while, but then he lost interest; fruit smoothies didn't fly. Neither did gazpacho or cucumber salad. But Adrian does like sliced cucumbers and celery. He's also increasingly interested in learning about the links between eating right and feeling strong.</em><em> </em><em><strong>Breakfast</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Lunch</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Dinner</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Protein.</strong> It's a key building block of all cells, yet it doesn't take much to meet a child's needs. For example, eight ounces of milk (one cup) and one ounce of cooked meat (the size of a third of a deck of cards) supply all the protein a 3-year-old needs in a day. For a 5-year-old, just add one more ounce of meat and another cup of milk. Extra protein won't hurt a child with healthy kidneys, but it can crowd out nutrient-rich vegetables and fruit.</em><em><strong>Saturated Fat.</strong> A childhood diet high in this type of fat can raise blood-cholesterol levels and lead to heart disease in adulthood if dietary patterns don't change. Starting at age 2, children should get no more than ten percent of their calories from saturated fat, although it's okay to make the shift gradually. Trans fatty acids (from partially hydrogenated oils) have similar effects. To cut back on saturated and trans fats, choose leaner cuts of meat, switch from whole to low-fat milk and dairy products, minimize fried fast foods, and limit high-fat commercial baked goods and snacks.</em><em> </em><em>When introducing new foods:</em><em> </em>     Nobody's diet is perfect, least of all a child's. That's why a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement can make sense for many kids. Always check with your pediatrician about your child's individual needs. Best bet: a kids' chewable multi (or a liquid for ages 2 and under) that supplies no more than 100% of the Daily Value for the nutrients on the label. Children who don't eat meat or poultry may need one with iron too. "
 New Thoughts on Nausea,http://www.parenting.com/article/new-thoughts-on-nausea,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekIt isn't easy being green, especially for the nearly three-quarters of all newly pregnant women who experience nausea <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">during pregnancy</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>. And despite its name, ""morning sickness"" can strike at any time.Pregnancy nausea usually begins between four and eight weeks of pregnancy. There's no one explanation for what causes it, says Jennifer Niebyl, M.D., professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City. Researchers currently suspect a variety of factors including levels of pregnancy hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), certain gastrointestinal bacteria like <em>H. pylori,</em> and vitamin deficiency (particularly vitamin B6). ""The hormone hCG plays a fundamental role in morning sickness,"" says Dr. Niebyl. ""If you're carrying multiples, you'll experience more nausea because of increased hCG levels.""Other factors include family history, predisposition to nausea (if you get car sick), and age (the younger you are, the greater the chances you'll be sick). The good news is that morning sickness is associated with having a healthy baby. While good news alone won't get rid of your nausea, the following remedies might help:<strong>? Avoid triggers,</strong> such as offensive odors and fatty, spicy foods. Increasing your protein intake may also help curb queasiness.<strong>? Eat frequent small, bland meals and drink plenty of water and fluids between them.</strong> Avoid an empty stomach -- and keep those crackers by your bedside.<strong>? Talk to your practitioner about increasing your intake of vitamin B6,</strong> which may lessen nausea, or ask about a new prenatal vitamin called PremesisRx that has a greater amount of vitamin B6 combined with folic acid and calcium carbonate. (It doesn't include iron, which can upset the stomach.)<strong>? Ask your doctor about medication</strong> such as vitamin B6 taken with the antihistamine Unisom Sleep Aid Tablets. This combination, formally sold as Bendectin, has been shown to be safe during pregnancy and is very effective at reducing morning sickness symptoms, says Dr. Niebyl.<strong>? Try alternative techniques.</strong> Relief Bands (which emit a gentle electrical current) or elastic motion-sickness bands worn on wrist acupressure points may provide some relief. And a new study has found that acupuncture may help reduce nausea.<strong>? Add ginger to your diet,</strong> as it's been shown to stave off nausea. Grate some into your tea, sip ginger ale made with real ginger, or snack on ginger cookies or candied ginger. Some other options are hard candies such as Gin-Gins or Preggie Pop lollipops and drops. And hang in there: Most women start to feel better in the second trimester."

If you don't consume enough during pregnancy, the fetus will rob your calcium stores, putting you at risk for bone loss.<br><strong>Where:</strong> To get the necessary 1,200 milligrams, consume at least four of the following servings: 8 ounces skim milk, 1 cup raw dark green leafy vegetables (salad greens, broccoli, spinach, kale), 3 to 4 ounces canned salmon or sardines, 3/4 cup cottage cheese, 1 cup yogurt, or 1 ounce hard cheese.</br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Iron</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> Iron is required to make hemoglobin, the red-blood-cell component that carries oxygen through the bloodstream. During pregnancy, more hemoglobin is required to supply your baby with oxygen. And the fetus also uses iron to build its own blood supply.<br><strong>Where:</strong> Pregnant women need twice as much iron -- about 30 milligrams a day -- so your doctor may prescribe a prenatal vitamin that contains iron. You should also try to eat some of the following foods daily: dried fruits, lean red meat, dried beans and pasta, whole-grain breads, and dark green leafy vegetables.</br></br><strong>Vitamin C</strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> This nutrient is essential because it helps in the manufacture of collagen, a protein that provides structure to your baby's bones, cartilage, muscles, and blood vessels. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant, which means that it helps prevent disease.<br><strong>Where:</strong> Your body can't store vitamin C, so it's crucial that you consume the necessary 65 milligrams daily. Get it by eating two to three of the following servings: 1/2 cup citrus-fruit juice, 1/2 grapefruit, 1 medium orange, 1/2 cup cantaloupe, 1/2 cup shredded cabbage or coleslaw, 2/3 cup cooked broccoli, 3/4 cup cooked cauliflower, 1 1/2 large tomatoes.</br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Folic Acid</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> This B vitamin is used to produce the extra blood you and your baby need and helps some enzymes function. Taken before conception and early in pregnancy, folic acid also helps prevent neural-tube defects (which occur when the brain, spinal cord, or their coverings do not form normally) and cleft lip or palate (a gap in the lip or roof of the mouth).<br><strong>Where:</strong> Good sources of folic acid include leafy green vegetables, broccoli, asparagus, lean beef, oranges, lentils, and peanuts. The FDA now requires that pastas, breads, and grains be enriched with folic acid, so be sure to eat plenty of these complex carbs. Your doctor may also prescribe a supplement -- 0.4 milligram a day for most women, 4.0 milligrams if you are at risk of having a baby with a neural-tube defect.</br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Vitamin A</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> This nutrient is vital to healthy skin, bones, and eyes and helps to create the cells that will make up your baby's internal organs.<br><strong>Where:</strong> You'll get all you need each day (800 micrograms) with just four servings of the following: 3/4 cup vegetable juice, 3/4 cup dark yellow vegetables, 8 ounces milk, 1/2 cup cantaloupe, 1 large peach or nectarine, 1 cup dark leafy vegetables. <em>Caution: Excessive levels of vitamin A (over 10,000 IU) can be harmful to you and your baby, so don't overdo it with supplements.</em></br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Carbohydrates</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> Vitamin D helps build bone, tissue, and teeth. It also enables your body to use calcium and phosphorus.<br><strong>Where:</strong> Your four 8-ounce servings of skim milk are about the best source of the 10 micrograms you need daily. Egg yolks, sardines, and canned salmon also provide vitamin D. Or get a little sunshine, which helps your skin manufacture it.</br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Zinc</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> This new addition to the must-have pregnancy diet has recently proved to aid fetal growth.<br><strong>Where:</strong> You can get the necessary 20 milligrams a day in your recommended amount of whole grains, meat, and milk, as well as oysters, shellfish, and other seafood.</br></br><strong><span class=""blue10b"">Fluids</span></strong><br><strong>Why:</strong> Water is essential for developing new cells, maintaining blood volume, and processing other nutrients. It also minimizes swelling, constipation, and your risk of urinary tract infections.<br><strong>Where:</strong> Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day, including milk, fruit juices, and decaffeinated tea or coffee.</br></br>"

 Pick the Right Multivitamin,http://www.parenting.com/article/pick-the-right-multivitamin,"<b>Look for the official seal.</b> Products approved by the U.S. Pharmacopeia Dietary Supplement Verification Program (USP-DSVP) meet certain safety and quality standards.<b>Check how much you're getting.</b> For trace minerals such as iron, fluoride, and zinc, it's safest not to exceed the daily value. Don't forget that what you get from fortified foods, like many breakfast cereals, counts, too.<b>Choose a product for women.</b> It's more likely to contain the right doses of the nutrients you need most  -- calcium and vitamin D for better bone health, folic acid to prevent birth defects, and iron for replacing what's lost during periods.

 Raising a Veggie Baby,http://www.parenting.com/article/raising-a-veggie-baby,"""Infants and toddlers grow at an astounding rate,"" says Ruth A. Lawrence, M.D., professor of pediatrics, obstetrics, and gynecology at the University of Rochester Medical Center. ""To fuel their physical growth and brain development, they use energy (or calories) at three times the rate of adults. And if nothing else, meat and dairy products are concentrated sources of calories and certain nutrients.""A baby who eats little or no animal products is more likely to lack adequate calories, protein, fat, calcium, iron, vitamin D, and vitamin B12, says William Cochran, M.D., associate professor of clinical pediatrics at Pennslyvania State University College of Medicine/Geisinger Medical Center. A deficiency of any of these crucial nutrients can affect everything from proper growth to nerve and brain development. Be sure to inform your pediatrician that your family is vegetarian, so that she too can be vigilant about checking for signs of nutritional deficiency at your child's regular visits. That said, here's a taste of what you need to know to keep Baby healthy and strong.If you're vegan and avoid all animal products (including cow's milk), be aware that any child under age 2 should be consuming breast milk or soy formula that's fortified with iron and vitamin D, cautions Dr. Cochran. Letting Baby play in the sun for 10 or 15 minutes without suncreen a few times a week will also help ensure proper vitamin D levels. Breast milk and formula will also provide a good deal of Baby's calcium. Other good sources for older babies include calcium-fortified soy milk, rice milk, and orange juice.Finding dietary sources of B12, however, may prove more difficult. Some cereals and soy milks are fortified. You can also sprinkle Red Star Vegetarian Support Formula nutritional yeast into Baby's food (it's a little like parmesan cheese). If you're worried that your child isn't getting enough calcium, iron, vitamin B12 or D, talk to your doctor about whether vitamin supplements are necessary.Families that eschew meat but still eat eggs and dairy products (lacto-ovo-vegetarians) have less to worry about. These foods contain most of the nutrients found in beef and chicken. Just remember that variety is key. Some of the most nutritious foods for all babies include sweet potatoes, bananas, avocados, papaya, cooked carrots, applesauce, and pureed split pea or lentil soup. Lacto-ovo-vegetarians should, of course, offer cheeses and yogurt.""Ultimately, it doesn't matter if your child is a vegetarian or not, as long as he is getting the nutrients he needs in the right number of calories,"" says Dr. Lawrence. ""The bottom line is that eating is a family affair. The emphasis of meals should be as much on relaxation and sharing as it is on counting nutrients."""
 How to Pick a Multivitamin,http://www.parenting.com/article/how-to-pick-a-multivitamin,"<b> Vitamin A</b>Be sure most is from beta-carotene, which your body converts to A as needed. Too much preformed A (retinol) can weaken bones and ups the risk of birth defects. The Daily Value (DV) is 5,000 international units; up to 10,000 a day seems safe. If you eat lots of A-fortified foods, skip a multi with retinol.<b> Folic acid</b>Look for at least 400 micrograms. If you get pregnant, the risk of your baby having a spinal-cord defect will be reduced.<b> Vitamins D, K, and B6</b>Many women get less than the recommended amounts. D and K are key for strong bones; B6 helps protect the heart.<b> Calcium</b>You won't get 100 percent of the DV (1,000 milli-grams) in a multi  -- it's too bulky. So if you don't eat calcium-rich foods like milk and yogurt, take a separate supplement.<b> Iron</b>If you're like most women, your diet's low in this mineral, so a multi can help you get more.

Is something wrong?<br><br>A. </br></br></strong>Most toddlers look at least a little bowlegged, which is totally normal. Babies are born with curved legs because the angle between the bones helped them fold up compactly in the womb. Between 18 months and 3 years, children's legs usually straighten out on their own.That said, bowlegged kids should be checked out by their doctor just to be sure they don't have a serious condition, such as Blount's disease (a problem with the tibia, one of the bones in the shin) or rickets (a disease caused by vitamin D deficiency, which can make bones weak). You should also call the doctor if your child seems to be getting more bowlegged or if he seems to be in pain when he walks."
" Nutrition Labels, Decoded",http://www.parenting.com/article/nutrition-labels-decoded-1203711328503,"<span class=""blue10b""><b>Serving Size</b></span><br><b>Start here, since the rest of the label's info is based on this number.</b> You might have to do some quick math when it comes to food for kids: If your toddler snacks on only 1/2 cup of cereal and the serving size is 1 cup, adjust accordingly to find out what nutrients he's getting. Also crucial: the ""servings per container"" line. Since many snacks (like a 16-ounce bottle of juice) actually have two servings per container, you'll have to double all the numbers if you end up scarfing down the whole thing. <br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Calories</b></span><br>One of the least important numbers for kids under 5, if they're at a normal weight. ""Little kids are more tuned in to their hunger than we are, so they can usually regulate their own calories,"" says Jeannie Gazzaniga-Moloo, Ph.D., a dietitian in Sacramento, California, and spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association (ADA). <b>For school-age kids -- and younger, if they're overweight -- you'll want to pay closer attention to how many calories they're taking in.</b> The ADA's recommended calorie intake:<br><b>Ages 2-3:</b> 1,000 to 1,400 calories per day <br><b>Ages 4-8:</b> 1,200 to 1,800 calories per day (boys need slightly more calories, and so do really active kids) <br><b>Ages 9-13:</b> 1,600 to 2,200 calories per day for girls; 1,800 to 2,600 calories per day for boys.<br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Calories From Fat</b></span><br><b>Kids should get 30 to 35 percent of their daily calories from fat,</b> while adults should shoot for less than 30 percent. An easy way to calculate fat calories: Look for a low ""calories from fat"" number. For example, a 100-calorie snack should have fewer than 30 calories from fat. <br><br><b><span class=""blue10b"">Cholesterol</span></b><br><b>Both kids and adults need to take in around 300 mg of cholesterol per day</b>, in part to make the myelin sheath that surrounds the body's nerves. While it's true that too much cholesterol can build up in the arteries and cause heart disease, experts now know that trans and saturated fats play a bigger role in raising blood cholesterol than does the cholesterol in food. The bottom line: Shoot for foods low in cholesterol, but you don't have to avoid it at all costs. <br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Sodium</b></span><br>The daily recommended allowance for kids: <br><b>Ages 2-3:</b> 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day<br><b>Ages 4-8:</b> 1,200 to 1,900 mg per day <br><b>Ages 9-13:</b> 1,500 to 2,200 mg per day <br>Since sodium may raise blood pressure in some people, the <b>maximum recommended for adults is 2,300 mg</b> -- about one teaspoon of salt! Of course, we all consume far more than that thanks to the amount of processed foods we eat. (Just one cup of boxed mac and cheese has nearly 600 mg.) And since most restaurant food is typically higher in sodium, it's smart to limit sodium-rich foods at home. <br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Vitamins </b></span><br>Vitamins and minerals are essential for growing kids, but your child is likely getting most of what she needs as long as she really eats things from every food group.<b> The nutrients kids most often lack include vitamins A, B6, C, and D and the minerals calcium, iron, and zinc.</b> See the % Daily Value to find out if a food is a good source of the vitamins and minerals listed on the label.<br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>% Daily Value</b></span><br><b>The percentage of nutrients in a food, based on the Food and Drug Administration's recommended daily intake. </b>The percentages are keyed to a 2,000-calorie diet, though, so a quick way to figure out what your child is getting is to use the percentage as a clue to whether a food is high or low in certain nutrients. A food that's 5 percent or less is considered to be low in that nutrient; if it's between 10 percent and 19 percent, it's a good source; 20 percent or higher means it's an excellent source.<br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Fats</b></span><br>We all need some fat to absorb vitamins, help our internal organs work efficiently, and keep us feeling satisfied after meals -- and it's especially important for kids' brain development. <b>But it's the type of fat to zero in on here.</b> When you check out a label, look for a low saturated-fat content and little or no trans fat. For both adults and children over 2, fewer than 10 percent of daily calories should come from saturated fat. Shortcut: Try to limit -- or, better, avoid -- packaged foods with a saturated-fat content over 1.5 grams per serving.<br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Carbohydrates</b></span><br><b>Pay attention to total carbohydrates, as well as the amount of dietary fiber and sugars in a food.</b> For a good idea of the type of fiber and sugar it contains, check the ingredients list. Whole-grain fiber is ideal, and should be high on the list, while sugars (which may be hiding under names that end in ""ose,"" like sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup) should be lower. <br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Ingredients</b></span><br><b>These are always listed from the greatest to smallest quantity,</b> so the first three to five ingredients will give you a sense of how healthy a food is. ""In general, you want to look for those that are recognizable, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and steer clear of anything that's hydrogenated, which signifies that it's a trans fat,"" says Gazzaniga- Moloo. What about those ingredients you can't pronounce?

Because it causes the blood vessels to narrow, the condition can restrict blood flow to the placenta, kidneys, and liver. Most women don't have symptoms, but those who do may experience swelling, headaches, and sudden weight gain (more than five pounds in a week).It's not known what causes preeclampsia, but if you've had it before, there's a 20 percent chance you'll get it again. Women who already have high blood pressure, or who have diabetes or lupus, are also more likely to develop the condition, as are moms-to-be over 35 and those carrying multiples.While there's no guaranteed way to prevent the disease, here's what to keep in mind:If you do develop preeclampsia, you'll be monitored and your doctor will probably induce labor."

 Up Your Child's Iron Intake,http://www.parenting.com/article/up-your-childs-iron-intake,"Kids often fall short because they don't eat enough meat and dark-green leafy vegetables  -- two big sources. And though breads, cereals, and other grains are usually fortified with iron, calcium can interfere with absorption in the body. If your child eats fortified cereal (the biggest source of iron for young kids) with milk, for instance, she won't absorb much of the iron.To boost intake, from Jodi Citrin, president of Citrition, a nutrition counseling practice in New York City:<b>Serve kid-friendly meat sources</b>, such as turkey sandwiches, burgers, beef tacos, and pasta with meatballs. (Serve red meats at most twice a week.) <b>Have your child drink non-calcium-fortified OJ</b> with an iron-packed breakfast, since vitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Or serve vitamin-C rich strawberries or oranges afterward.<b>While it's great to drink milk with meals</b>, you might aim for at least one meal that's a good source of iron (consisting of meat and/or fortified grains), and serve water or 100 percent fruit juice instead.<b>Serve snacks that are good sources</b> of iron: hummus (with pita for dipping), watermelon, raisins, and dry fortified cereal."

 Iron-Clad Nutrition,http://www.parenting.com/article/iron-clad-nutrition-21354364,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekDuring pregnancy a woman's daily requirement for iron doubles, from 15 to 30 milligrams -- and no wonder: Iron is a major component of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen throughout the body and to the placenta. It also enables both mother and fetus to form new red blood cells. Getting enough iron becomes especially important in the second and third trimesters, when maternal blood volume increases and the fetus begins to store the mineral for the first few months after birth.A shortage of iron can leave an expectant mom tired, pale, and infection-prone. If you have a deficiency, your doctor may prescribe an iron supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamin. However, you should still aim to eat at least four or five servings of iron-rich foods each day. For an extra boost, preparing foods in cast-iron cookware can increase their iron content. You can also enhance your body's absorption of iron by pairing foods containing iron with a source of vitamin C (a snack of raisins and orange juice, a tomato-and-ground beef pasta sauce), and combining meat sources of iron with nonmeat sources (as in beef-and-bean chili). Because the tannin in tea and the polyphenols in coffee can interfere with iron absorption, avoid drinking them with meals."

Best dietary sources are leafy green vegetables (especially spinach), citrus fruits, nuts, legumes, and whole grains.

His stitches are now out, and there's a scar on his forehead. Is there anything I can do to make it less noticeable?<br><br>A. Bumps and falls are an unavoidable part of childhood, so lots of kids end up with stitches at some point (my four older children have each had them at least once). There are treatments on the market, such as ones made from vitamin E or onion extract, that are purported to diminish scars; there is no good medical evidence that they work. (If vitamin E is used too early, it may make the scar worse.) Sunburn can make scars appear larger, so using sunscreen's a good idea.</br></br>The next time your child gets stitches, make sure to keep the area clean and get them out on time. Apply a petroleum jelly-based ointment like Aquaphor during the first few weeks after the stitches are taken out.As your child grows older, there are other safe treatments (such as laser surgery) available if the scar's noticeable enough to bother him. Chances are, though, this won't be necessary—most scars fade by themselves over time."

Every pregnant woman is encouraged to take them, so as soon as I got the positive pregnancy test, I dutifully bought a new bottle and worked it back into my daily routine.Then my midwife tested my vitamin D levels as part of a routine blood draw at the start of my second trimester and while the results weren’t abysmal, they certainly could’ve been better. So I stopped at the local food co-op and picked up some supplements. And tossed a bottle of <a href=""http://www.americanpregnancy.org/pregnancyhealth/omega3fishoil.html"">fish oil</a> and some <a href=""http://www.lamaze.org/Forums/AskHenci/tabid/363/aff/12/aft/30896/afv/topic/Default.aspx"">probiotics</a> in my basket as well, for good measure.A few weeks later, I had a cold sore outbreak on my lip. Then another as soon as that one healed. And when I started to feel the tingling of a third ($#&amp;$!), I called my midwife. Then went <em>back </em>to the local co-op for a bottle of lysine. Repeat the above scenario for <a href=""../../../../../../../../blogs/project-pregnancy/amanda-jo-greep/welcome-back-old-friend-please-keep-your-visit-brief"">the world’s worst Charley Horse</a> and a bottle of Calcium Magnesium found its way to my kitchen counter as well.Initially, I felt silly popping all these pills each night. But then my cold sore outbreaks stopped dead in their tracks and at my next blood draw, my vitamin D levels had soared to optimal levels. <em>And </em>I haven’t had a single Charley Horse – or even small leg cramp – in the 8 weeks since I started taking Calcium Magnesium.I call all of that a big WIN.Now it’s time to tackle the insane <a href=""http://heartburn.about.com/od/preventingheartburn/a/pregnancyhrtbrn.htm"">acid reflux</a> that has been plaguing me for the last several weeks.

No problem. With good planning, <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">vegetarians</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> can easily meet nutritional requirements while pregnant and nursing. ""It's the nutritive quality of a mother's foods, not the original source of each nutrient, that makes the difference in a baby's health,"" says Holly Roberts, M.D., a San Francisco-based ob/gyn and author of <i>Your Vegetarian Pregnancy</i>. Assess your diet to make sure you're meeting the recommended dietary allowances (ask your doctor for a list or find them in Roberts's book). The steps below can help you overcome some common challenges:<b>Mix it up.</b> Vary foods daily so that trace minerals and nutrients you don't consume one day will be consumed later that week.<b>Take prenatal vitamins.</b> Supplements help pick up the slack where your diet falls short, says Roberts. Ask your health care provider whether you also need to take a calcium supplement to help you meet the recommended 1,200 milligrams (mg) per day, particularly if you don't eat dairy.<b>Pump up your iron.</b> A mother transfers a total of up to 1,000 mg of iron to her baby during pregnancy, which could cause her to develop iron-deficiency anemia, a condition characterized by fatigue. Although red meat is the most commonly known source, it's not the only way to get the mineral. Increase daily intake to 30 mg by eating foods like lentils, spinach, chickpeas, pumpkin, and almonds. Your doctor will perform a blood test to see if you need supplements beyond the iron you're getting in your prenatal vitamin.<b>B aggressive.</b> B vitamins are vital to moms. One of the most critical in this group is folic acid, which helps prevent neural tube defects when it's taken in the earliest weeks of pregnancy (so start taking prenatal vitamins when you're trying to conceive). Most pregnant women need a total of 600 micrograms (mcg) of folate (400 mcg from a supplement and 200 mcg from foods) -- though some doctors may recommend more for vegetarians. Good sources of folate include beans, nuts, greens, and fortified breads and cereals. Vegans, in particular, are at risk for deficiencies of B12, a.k.a. cobalamin, because they don't eat meat, dairy, or eggs, the most common sources of the vitamin. The Centers for Disease Control recently warned that maternal deficiencies of B12 can cause developmental delays in infants. It recommends a supplement of 2.6 mcg during pregnancy and 2.8 mcg while nursing.<b>Pack in the protein.</b> Protein is essential for building your baby's bones and tissues during pregnancy, as well as helping you produce breast milk postpartum. Eat larger amounts of such protein-rich foods as eggs, yogurt, and milk (if you include dairy in your diet), as well as beans, nuts, and tofu to get the recommended 60 grams per day during pregnancy and 65 grams while nursing. It's not a huge hurdle if you consider that one cup of firm tofu has 40 grams of protein.<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=81571858&amp;src=id"">Shutterstock Image</a>"

GNC guy knows I'm having lots of sex with my husband.Even though this encounter weirded me out, and I was not at all interested in talking with GNC guy about my sex life (even if he was encouraging!), I have to admit, that's pretty much what I'm doing now on this blog. I'm talking to people I don't know about this very personal time. In fact, I'm reminded of this anew every time a co-worker asks me a question about the blog. It even sort of startles me when someone brings it up because it forces me to remember that I'm telling this intimate information to the world. Still, somehow it's different when I'm writing it down in this context. Because this blog isn't for the GNC guy or other passing strangers, it's for people like me — women who are trying to get pregnant (or who are thinking about getting pregnant). And I hope this will be a place where we can talk about how the process is going — a place where we can share our experiences, trade stories, vent when things aren't going well, and ultimately, feel hopeful. GNC guys need not apply."

 Study Finds Link Between Autism and Excess Folate during Pregnancy,http://www.parenting.com/news-break/study-finds-link-between-autism-and-excess-folate-during-pregnancy,"""We are not suggesting anyone stop supplementation,"" researcher says.<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=290715461&amp;src=id"" target=""_blank"">Shutterstock</a>A new study looks at the link between <a href=""http://www.salon.com/2016/05/11/a_study_asks_too_much_folic_acid_a_cause_of_autism/"" target=""_blank"">folate levels in pregnancy and a baby's risk of developing autism</a> later in life.For years, pregnant women have been told taking folic acid, which is the synthetic form of the vitamin folate and is found in foods like spinach, beans, and fortified cereals and snacks, is vital for the healthy development of a growing baby's brain and nervous system. Now, new research finds there may be too much of a good thing when it comes to ingesting folate during pregnancy.<strong>More from News Break:</strong> <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/news-break/couple-their-70s-become-parents-first-time"">Couple in Their 70s Become Parents for the First Time</a>Researchers looked at 1,391 kids born at Boston University Medical Center from 1998 to 2013. Approximately 100 kids were later diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder.When researchers found high levels of folate in a mother's blood at the time of delivery, she was <a href=""https://consumer.healthday.com/cognitive-health-information-26/autism-news-51/too-much-folic-acid-in-pregnancy-linked-to-autism-risk-710859.html"" target=""_blank"">twice as likely to have an autistic child</a>. A high level of vitamin B12 also seemed to elevate one's risk—threefold. In fact, when both levels were very high, researchers found a 17-fold greater risk that a child would later develop autism.Interestingly, most moms who participated in the study took multivitamins that contained folic acid and vitamin B12, yet only some women showed high levels in their blood. This could mean those women took too many supplements, perhaps consumed too much folate in their diets as well, or there could be a genetic reason some moms absorb more folate.<strong>More from News Break:</strong> <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/news-break/mom-helped-daughter-beat-cancer-now-shes-fighting-disease"">Mom Helped Daughter Beat Cancer, But Now She's Fighting the Disease</a>It's important to point out that the vitamin levels were tested at birth, not during early pregnancy when a baby's brain is developing. It's also worth noting that experts have called the findings of this study into question because they were based on a small sample of families at a single hospital.Plus, a <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/special-needs-blog/brian-parentingcom/autism-folic-acid-pregnancy"">2013 study found the opposite relationship</a> between folate during pregnancy and a child's risk of having autism. So it would be right to feel confused by the many studies that look at pregnancy nutrition and behaviors and their link to having an autistic child.The bottom line is this study is not recommending that pregnant women change their folate intake.""<a href=""http://www.salon.com/2016/05/11/a_study_asks_too_much_folic_acid_a_cause_of_autism/"" target=""_blank"">We are not suggesting anyone stop supplementation</a>,"" researcher M. Daniele Fallin told Salon.And no cause and effect relationship has been established; this study simply found a link between high levels of folate in a mother's blood at birth and a child's risk for developing autism later in life.<strong>More from News Break:</strong> <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/news-break/math-test-question-7-year-olds-puzzles-parents"">Math Test Question for 7-Year-Olds Puzzles Parents</a>But this study, which was presented at the International Meeting for Autism Research in Baltimore this week, does raise an interesting question.""The new research question before us is to <a href=""https://consumer.healthday.com/cognitive-health-information-26/autism-news-51/too-much-folic-acid-in-pregnancy-linked-to-autism-risk-710859.html"" target=""_blank"">understand the optimal dose</a>,"" said Fallin.Dr. Paul Wang, senior vice president of medical research for Autism Speaks, says this study shows when pregnant women take folic acid and B12 three to five times a week, there's a protective effect against autism.""What we've always believed to be true remains true, that <a href=""https://consumer.healthday.com/cognitive-health-information-26/autism-news-51/too-much-folic-acid-in-pregnancy-linked-to-autism-risk-710859.html"" target=""_blank"">supplements decrease the risk of autism</a>.

 Sun Safety Vocabulary,http://www.parenting.com/article/sun-safety-vocabulary,"Feel like you need a Ph.D. in beachology to understand what's printed on that bottle or tube? A quick SPF glossary:<strong>""Broad Spectrum"" or ""UVA/UVB Protection""</strong> These phrases mean that the sunscreen offers protection against UVA rays as well as UVB ones. Remember, the SPF rating only measures how well the product protects against UVB rays; UVA rays are harder to measure, so sun formulas don't carry ratings for them. But UVA rays can lead to wrinkles and other signs of aging, while they and UVB rays can cause skin cancer, so it's important that the sunscreen you choose protects against both (many do).<strong>""Non-Stinging"" or ""Tear Free""</strong> Both of these terms mean that the product won't sting your kid's eyes when he accidentally rubs them with lotioned-up hands.<strong>""Waterproof""</strong> This claim means the product will stay on wet skin longer than a non-waterproof formula would. So you and your kids will be protected while you're swimming. But you still need to reapply it generously every two hours and after swimming, toweling off (and after sweaty rounds of beach volleyball).<strong>""Sunblock""</strong> Though the use of the word ""block"" isn't regulated (no product can entirely block the sun's rays), it typically contains titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, found in special formulas designed for infants.<strong>""With Protective Vitamins""</strong> A phrase that means the sunscreen contains vitamin A and two different forms of vitamin E. All are anti-oxidants that can protect skin from damaging free radicals. They're nice to have, but not necessary.<strong>""Quick and Even Coverage""</strong> The product was specially formulated to go on smoothly and easily.<strong>""Continuous protection""</strong> Formulated to stay effective longer than traditional products, so there is less of a drop-off in protection as the time to reapply nears.<strong>Missed a Spot?</strong><br>Don't blow your cover: Families come to the beach wearing shirts, then take them off and forget to put SPF on their torsos. Other commonly missed areas: the tops of ears and feet; the backs of necks and hands; and the skin around the eyes, since parents are afraid of getting sunscreen in kids' peepers (look for a formula labeled ""tear free""). Finally, don't forget to use a lip balm with SPF 45.</br>"
 4 Food Label Claims Decoded,http://www.parenting.com/article/4-food-label-claims-decoded,"Is that soup or cereal really as healthy as it seems? Maybe not. How to read between the lines on packaging:<b>Claim: ""0 grams trans fat!""</b><br><b>The facts:</b> This doesn't mean that the fat the food does have is the healthy mono- or polyunsaturated kind. ""I've seen some that are loaded with an entire day's worth of bad saturated fat. It's misleading,"" says Michael Jacobson, Ph.D., executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition and food-safety advocacy group in Washington, DC.</br><b>Claim: ""All natural!""</b><br><b>The facts: </b>Sounds great, but look at the ingredient list. Some products with manufactured high-fructose corn syrup are still allowed to make this claim, even though it's essentially a high-calorie sweetener and preservative.</br><b>Claim: ""Supports immunity in kids!""</b><br><b>The facts: </b>This is a biggie because parents make the mental leap from ""supports immunity"" to ""prevents colds and flu."" And who wouldn't want to snap that up? ""You see this claim on cereals, juices, frozen veggies, and sugar-packed drink pouches. But there's nothing magical about that particular product versus another one. Any food with a decent amount of vitamins can say this -- despite whatever other processed garbage may be in it -- because the anti-oxidants in vitamins are, in fact, involved with immunity,"" Jacobson explains. And vitamins won't have any effect on kids' resistance to illness.</br><b>Claim: ""Made with 100 percent fruit!""</b><br><b>The facts:</b> Whatever the item, it's unlikely to be as good for your kid as an actual piece of fruit. And don't be bowled over by the ""100 percent"" part; it means very little if that ""real fruit"" comprises only 1 percent of the cereal bar. Check the ingredients. If fruit isn't one of the first few on the list, it probably has only a scant amount.</br>"

Gum it up.</strong> Chewing sugar-free gum may help people eat less, finds new research from the University of Rhode Island. Chewing gum in the morning led study participants to eat 68 fewer calories at lunch. Chomping gum before and after eating resulted in burning up to 8 percent more calories during the day. An added bonus: Gum chewers reported that they felt less tired and said doing tasks seemed easier. So go ahead and burst some bubbles to help battle the bulge.<strong>2. Watch your sodas.</strong> Drinking two or more artificially sweetened diet drinks a day can double your risk of rapid kidney decline later in life, according to a study of 3,000 women by Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston.<strong>3. Give back.</strong> If your back's more sore during winter months, it could be you're not getting enough vitamin D, reports a new clinical review in Pain Treatment Topics. One study looked at 360 patients with chronic back pain and found that all of them had low levels of the vitamin. After taking supplements for three months, 95 percent of the patients had improved symptoms. Most adults need at least 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day, but researchers believe people with chronic back pain may need twice that. Talk to your doctor to see if your aching back can benefit from extra D.<strong>Plus: A Quick Stress Soothing Tip:</strong>Morning tantrums, dinner-table battles, bedtime drama. If your crazy day's making you wonder why you had kids in the first place, take a deep breath and try this stress-zapping exercise from Susan Albers, Psy.D., author of 50 Ways to Soothe Yourself Without Food: Find a quiet spot (lock yourself in a closet if you have to), and freeze.

My husband was just laid off and money is kind of tight. Now, I just found out I'm pregnant. How long can you go without seeing a doctor? </strong><strong>A.</strong> Early prenatal care is very important for having a healthy pregnancy. Try to be checked by a healthcare provider within the first six weeks of your pregnancy. The sooner, the better. These visits are more than just a checkup: You will receive important counseling on proper nutrition during your pregnancy. You'll also get a prescription for prenatal vitamin supplements. Of course, the checkup is important too, to see if you and your baby have special medical needs.<strong>Getting Assistance</strong>Pregnancy is the time when you and your baby need medical care the most. That's why there are so many government-sponsored resources available to pregnant women. The best place to start looking for help is your local Department of Health. Call and ask about qualifications for Medicaid and other assistance programs for pregnant mothers. Since your income is low right now, you will probably qualify for state-assisted medical care throughout your pregnancy and delivery. You should also look in the phonebook for free prenatal clinics in your area.There are a lot of other things you can do for self-care during your pregnancy, and they are very economical:<strong>Read all about it.</strong> Get a copy of <em>The Pregnancy Book</em> written by Martha, myself, and obstetrician Dr. Linda Holt (Little, Brown). This is a month-by-month guide that tells you everything you need to know about taking proper care of yourself throughout your pregnancy. You will find lots of information to increase your chances of having a safe and satisfying delivery. See if it's available at your local library or if you can borrow it from a friend.<strong>Create a healthy womb environment.</strong> Refrain from smoking, excessive alcohol, and drugs or medications that are not prescribed by your doctor. Eat right for two. You will need an extra 300 to 500 calories and 25 grams of protein per day. Stick to nutrient-dense foods -- those that pack a lot of nutrition with fewer calories -- such as grains, lowfat yogurt, cottage cheese, tofu, salmon, eggs, vegetables, and lean meat. Avoid sugar and corn syrup-sweetened beverages. Stay away from packaged carbs that do not also contain fiber and protein. In fact, the fewer packages and boxes you open during your pregnancy, the better your nutrition will be. During your pregnancy, you'll feel more comfortable eating frequent, nutritious, mini-meals throughout the day rather than three big meals.<strong>Take your vitamins.</strong> In addition to the daily increase in calories, you need 800 milligrams of extra calcium, 0.4 milligrams of extra folic acid, and lots of extra iron and other minerals. As a nutritional insurance policy, take a prenatal vitamin, which contains the extra vitamins and minerals you will need throughout your pregnancy. I also recommend you add omega-3 fats to your diet. A great way to do this is to eat four ounces of salmon three times a week. Of if you're not a fish-lover, take a daily supplement that contains 200 milligrams DHA -- the most vital omega-3 fat for your baby -- DHA.<strong>Keep fit.</strong> Mothers who keep physically fit during pregnancy are more likely to grow a healthier baby and have an easier delivery. Take a brisk walk for at least 45 minutes a day during the first half of your pregnancy. During the second half, swimming is the safest all-around exercise, since it's easiest on your joints.By following these self-help medical tips, you will greatly increase your chances of enjoying a healthy pregnancy and delivering a healthy baby. And just think, to skip prenatal care may turn out to be much more costly."

Otherwise, your body will draw from the calcium stored in your bones to build your fetus' skeleton.Your prenatal vitamin will give you a head start by supplying 200 to 300 of the 1,000 mg of calcium a day that doctors recommend during pregnancy.If you're lactose intolerant, try milk treated with lactase (an enzyme that breaks down lactose so the body can absorb it easily). And because much of the lactose is removed from cheese when it's made, it provides an easily digestible calcium boost.Milk-loathers may enjoy chocolate milk -- a tablespoon of chocolate syrup adds just 50 calories -- as well as yogurt. Preparing such foods as mashed potatoes and pudding with dry milk, which has more than three times the calcium of regular milk, is another way to fool milk-shy taste buds."
 The Importance of Folic Acid,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-importance-of-folic-acid,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekEven though every enriched grain product, from cereal to pita bread, now includes folic acid -- a crucial vitamin that prevents birth defects of the brain and spine -- a new study found that many women are still not getting enough. Why? A woman must consume adequate folate (the naturally occurring form in food) or folic acid during the first weeks of pregnancy -- before she knows she's going to have a baby.The study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that only 40 percent of Caucasian women get enough folic acid. The numbers are even lower -- 19 and 21 percent -- for African-Americans and Hispanics. ""Most nonpregnant women consume less than the recommended 400 micrograms a day,"" says Heather Carter Hamner, nutrition epidemiologist with the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. Since 49 percent of pregnancies are unplanned, doctors recommend that all women of childbearing age pop a daily multivitamin containing folic acid."
 Could You Be At Risk For Anemia?,http://www.parenting.com/article/could-you-be-at-risk-for-anemia,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekFor many women, pregnancy can be as tiring as it is exciting. While some fatigue is normal for moms-to-be, excessive tiredness may be a sign of anemia, a deficiency of red blood cells (which carry oxygen in the blood) that affects up to half of pregnant women.Why is this condition so common? During a normal pregnancy, the volume of fluid in a woman's blood increases by as much as 50 percent, diluting the concentrations of red blood cells and hemoglobin, a critical protein in these cells. If levels drop too low, the body's ability to carry oxygen to the lungs, tissues, and the baby can be compromised.Untreated, a severe case of anemia can cause poor fetal growth, preterm birth, and low birth weight. But since women are routinely tested for the condition at their first prenatal visit and then again during their second trimester, doctors usually catch the condition before it becomes serious. ""In the majority of cases, when the condition is diagnosed and treated, it's not going to harm you or your baby,"" says Laura Riley, M.D., a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston. Here's what you need to know:Though taking an iron supplement can lead to constipation and nausea, it reduces symptoms and restores red-blood-cell count to normal levels, says Dr. Riley. Most iron-deficiency anemia cases will clear up in a few weeks. Exercise, as well as extra fluids and fiber, can help reduce the constipation associated with iron supplements. Those with folic acid- or B12-deficiency anemia will be instructed to take supplements of those vitamins."

 Keeping Breast Milk Fresh?,http://www.parenting.com/article/keeping-breast-milk-fresh,"<strong>Q.</strong> How long does expressed milk keep?<strong>A.</strong> Refrigerated breast milk, which can be stored in glass, plastic, or stainless steel containers, is best used within 48 hours. Frozen milk keeps for three months if your freezer has a separate door, two weeks if it doesn't.

 Ask Dr. Sears: Advantages of Goat's Milk,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-advantages-of-goats-milk,"<strong>A.</strong> I frequently advise goat's milk for patients in my pediatric practice, especially those who have digestive problems or who are unable to tolerate cow's milk. In infants who show an intolerance to cow's milk—symptoms of this can include colicky abdominal pain, bloating, diarrhea and facial rashes—parents often report that many of these allergic reactions disappear or greatly improve after switching to goat's milk. Here are the reasons why goat's milk is more easily digested and less allergenic than cow's milk in many infantsThe protein clumps that are formed by the action of the stomach acids on the protein are called curds. The softer the curd, the quicker it passes through the stomach. Goat's milk protein forms a softer curd, which makes it easier to digest. This could be an advantage for infants who spit up a lot or who have <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-coping-with-babys-acid-reflux"">gastroesophageal reflux (GER)</a>. Goat's milk contains only trace amounts of the allergenic protein found in cow's milk—alpha-S1 casein. However, goat's milk and cow's milk both contain another type of allergenic protein, beta-lactoglobulin, which is why some infants who are allergic to cow's milk may also be allergic to goat's milkThe fat globules in goat's milk are easier to digest because they contain a higher proportion of short and medium-chain fatty acids. It's a biochemical quirk that allows the intestinal enzymes to digest the fat easier. Cow's milk contains more of the longer-chain fatty acids that require more work for the intestines to digestWhile both cow's milk and goat's milk contain the sugar lactose, goat's milk contains slightly less (4.1 percent versus 4.7 percent in cow's milk). It's possible that this is a slight advantage for infants who are lactose intolerantThe vitamin and mineral content of goat's milk and <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-cows-milk-for-babies"">cow's milk</a> are fairly similar, though goat's milk contains a bit more calcium, vitamin B6, vitamin A, potassium, niacin, copper and the antioxidant selenium. On the other hand, cow's milk contains more vitamin B12 and much more folic acid. Since goat's milk contains less than ten percent of the amount of folic acid contained in cow's milk, it must be supplemented with folic acid. For this reason, be sure you get a goat's milk that is supplemented with folic acid, which the best brands usually are (If you're unsure of a good brand, I recommend Meyenberg goat milk to my patients.).Also, be sure to buy goat's milk that's certified ""free of bovine growth hormone (BGH) and antibiotics."" Generally, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend the use of goat's or cow's milk products in infants under one year because they can cause intestinal irritation and anemia. Infants under one year of age who are allergic to cow's milk-based formulas, soy formulas or hypoallergenic formulas are sometimes put on goat's milk formula, but only with consultation from baby's doctor or a pediatric nutritionist."

 5 Common SPF Mistakes,http://www.parenting.com/article/5-common-spf-mistakes,"<b>1. Not Knowing Your Kid's Camp or School Policy</b><br>Many places either won't reapply SPF or consider it a medication, meaning you need to send a note giving the okay.</br><b>2. Polishing Off Last Summer's Bottle</b><br>We've all done this! But according to Elizabeth Hale, M.D., a clinical associate professor of dermatology at New York University, opened sunscreen can lose its potency -- especially over the course of 12 months -- and not provide the same protection.</br><b>3. Not Reapplying Often Enough</b><br>""If your kids are out all afternoon and you don't put more on, that 30 you used earlier in the day may really only protect like an 8 or a 6,"" says Dr. Hale. Reapply every two hours and as soon as they get out of the water, regardless of how long it's been.</br><b>4. Feeling the Need to Buy Multiple Bottles</b><br>The formulations of kids' and adults' brands are often the same. ""Some child brands are made to be tear-free or less irritating, but if your kids don't have any sensitivities, it's okay to apply the same stuff you use,"" says Sheila Friedlander, M.D., a clinical professor of medicine and pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego.</br><b>5.

On top of that, women carrying multiples need another 150 to 300 calories for each additional baby, says Ellie Krieger, R.D., nutritionist and new mom. That translates to 450 to 600 extra calories a day for twins, and 600 to 900 for triplets.But eating 600 calories' worth of marshmallows probably isn't the best way to help your babies grow. ""The key to pregnancy nutrition is that you have to get the most nutrient-dense foods possible, because you need a lot of extra nutrients without a lot of extra calories. This becomes even more important when you're carrying multiples,"" says Krieger.The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends getting those extra calories from calcium- and protein-rich snacks. A few great choices (all about 300 calories): a cup of lowfat yogurt and a piece of fresh fruit; two eggs and a piece of whole-grain toast; a cup of cooked black or pinto beans topped with low-fat, pasteurized cheddar cheese; or four fig bars with a glass of skim milk.Although increasing your daily calorie intake with healthy foods should provide the extra vitamins and minerals your babies need to develop, your physician may also prescribe additional prenatal vitamins and iron supplements for multiples. ""The bottom line,"" says Krieger, ""is that you want to gain weight appropriately."" Follow the guidelines on the right from the March of Dimes, track your weight, and increase or decrease your diet accordingly. If you're feeling overly tired or if you're gaining too much or too little weight, talk to your doctor."

If you decide to raise your child vegetarian, tell your pediatrician and ask about any special considerations, as well as vitamin and mineral supplements. Depending on the type of vegetarian diet you follow, some specific rules apply:<strong>STRICT VEGETARIANS</strong>, known as vegans, don't eat any animal products, including dairy foods and eggs. Babies under age 1 should be given soy-based formula (not soy milk) if they aren't breastfeeding.Once you introduce solids, at around 4 to 6 months, make sure your child gets enough iron, B12, calcium, and protein. Offer iron-enriched grains and cereals (serve them with citrus fruits or other vitamin C-rich foods to help with absorption). Try calcium- and B12-fortified, protein-rich soy products, such as finely chopped soy hot dogs and tofu. And prepare macaroni and cheese and soups with soy cheese and soy milk. At 7 months, your baby can start eating pureed beans, lentils, and split peas for protein.<strong>LACTO-VEGETARIANS</strong> include dairy foods, but not eggs, in their diet. Daily calcium and protein requirements are easier to meet, but lacto-vegetarians still need extra protein, iron, and B12.<strong>LACTO-OVO VEGETARIANS</strong> eat dairy products as well as eggs, another source of iron. Once your child begins to eat solids, seek out protein-, iron-, and B12-rich foods, but don't serve egg whites until after age 1 to avoid her developing an allergy to eggs."

Eating a little junk food now and then will not harm you and your baby, but you don't want to get all of your daily calories from foods high in fat and low in nutrients.According to the <a href=""http://food.unl.edu/fnh"" target=""_blank"">University of Nebraska</a>, avoiding the wrong foods can help you as much as eating the right foods.Throughout your pregnancy, morning sickness and heartburn can make you feel miserable and affect your eating habits.

 6 Food Myths That Are Making Kids Fat,http://www.parenting.com/toddler/feeding-nutrition/6-food-myths-are-making-kids-fat,"Childhood obesity expert reveals common <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">food</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> myths that are making kids gain weight<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=75104449&amp;src=id"" target=""_blank"">Shutterstock</a>According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov/obesity/childhood/index.html"" target=""_blank"">obesity rates in children</a> are twice what they were 30 years ago. Many parents are unsure why their children are seemingly unable to stop gaining weight. As a childhood obesity expert and Medical Director of <a href=""http://www.gramercypediatrics.com/"">Gramercy Pediatrics</a>, I know several common food myths are making kids fat.There's a lot of confusion surrounding healthy food choices. A stroll down almost any supermarket aisle in the country, and customers will find products that advertise healthy ingredients, when in reality they can lead to weight gain in children. It can be confusing to decipher what the healthiest food options truly are. I suggest looking out for these hazardous eating myths when trying to <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/toddler/feeding-nutrition/dining-out-kids-healthy-eating-dont-have-to-be-mutually-exclusive"">make healthier choices for your children</a>:Food trends and product labels can mislead you into believing you're eating a healthy diet. When deciding what to feed growing children, it's important to look at foods as a whole. Look at things like sodium, artificial sweeteners, nutritional value, and calories. All of these play a role in determining if a food item is healthy or not.Sodium can lead to high blood pressure, even in children. <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/high-sodium"">Lowering sodium is especially important for children</a> who are overweight in order to lower their risk for heart disease in the future. You should also look out for artificial sweeteners, which can make children want to eat more food, consequently consuming more calories than they otherwise would. Additionally, growing children need certain nutrients from their food. A slightly higher calorie meal might be a healthier option if it's providing significant amounts of vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D, iron, and/or calcium.Many parents believe that since fruit is healthy, fruit juice is great for their children. However, this <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/hidden-sugar"">high-calorie sugary beverage</a> could be contributing to weight gain. Some argue that the drinks have great nutritional value because they can be rich in vitamins, but you're better off giving your child fresh fruit to eat, which also contains fiber that is lost in the juicing process. The excess calories from juice also fill children up so that they don't want to eat the solid foods that have fiber, protein, and healthy fats.Cereal is an easy and tasty breakfast option for kids rushing to make the school bus. But beware, most child marketed cereal options contain more sugar than the standard dessert. Cereal can be tricky; <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/toddler/feeding-nutrition/kids-breakfast-cereal-over-fortified-vitamins"">misleading labels often advertise healthy ingredients</a>, vitamins, and whole grains. But these boasted benefits can be outweighed by the sugar quantity. The excessive glucose can lead to a rapid increase in blood sugar as well as an increase in calorie consumption. I recommend reading food labels carefully to replace sugary cereals with healthier options. You need to keep a sharp eye out for sneaky sugar terms that may appear on boxes, such as organic molasses, bee honey, and organic sugar cane, which fool parents into believing that they're healthy cereals. Better breakfast options, like fruit, low-fat yogurt, eggs, and oatmeal, give kids the energy they need without packing on the pounds.There are fewer differences between white bread and whole wheat bread than most people believe. They both have high levels of glucose that are broken down into the bloodstream the same way. This not only causes weight gain but can lead to a more serious health problem, such as diabetes.If a package is labeled as whole wheat, it doesn't mean it contains the healthy grains children need. Processed whole wheat bread is almost entirely stripped of fiber. Be careful when reading bread labels and look for packages that read 100 percent whole grains. These healthier alternatives have been shown to allow for more balanced <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/high-fructose-corn-syrup"">glucose level in children</a>.Frozen yogurt can be a healthier alternative to most ice creams, but that doesn't mean that it's the best option. Although most frozen yogurt is low-fat, it still contains more calories than most people imagine. A large cup of standard frozen yogurt is around 380 calories with 76 grams of sugar, not including toppings. Most kids prefer their flavored frozen yogurt with sugary toppings, which can be just as fattening as ice cream. Adding sprinkles, candy, and artificial syrups leads to potentially harmful levels of sugar. Instead, serve kids plain low-fat frozen yogurt with fruit. The fruit will sweeten up the yogurt without adding unnecessary, harmful sugars. Also, make sure to keep the portion sizes small to lessen the buildup of calories.This sneaky snack often contains the same number of calories as potato chips and can have the same weight gaining effects, too. The small serving of vegetables found in veggie chips are countered by the high amounts of potato and corn flour. The vital nutrients that vegetables contain are lost in the process when veggie chips are manufactured. Try cutting out the processed potato altogether and making healthy vegetable snacks at home. Kale baked with a small amount of olive oil and salt is crispy like a potato chip, without having the same unhealthy ingredients that can compromise children's health and weight.<em><strong>Dr. Dyan Hes,</strong> is the Medical Director of <a href=""http://www.gramercypediatrics.com/"">Gramercy Pediatrics</a> in New York City, and she serves as a Director of the American Board of Obesity Medicine.

 12 Tips For a Healthy Pregnancy,http://www.parenting.com/article/12-tips-healthy-pregnancy,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekYou’ve been trying to get pregnant for months—maybe even years—and it’s finally happened: Your <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">pregnancy</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> test is positive.After focusing for so long on conceiving, you may be wondering what to do now that you are pregnant. While there’s no way to guarantee a healthy pregnancy, there are many things you can do to lower the risk of birth defects and miscarriage. By making these dozen healthy choices, recommended by the March of Dimes and fertility experts, you’ll boost your chances of having a healthy baby.<strong>1. Call to Schedule Your First Prenatal Medical Visit</strong><br>If you conceived fairly easily and you’re in good general health, your first prenatal check-up will probably not be for several weeks. If you’re considered at high risk of problems, it may be sooner. At that first visit, your obstetrician, midwife, or family doctor will check your blood pressure, weigh you, figure out your due date, test for various infections that could harm your baby, do a urine analysis, monitor any previous health problems you might have, perform an internal pelvic exam, and do a Pap test, if you haven’t had one recently.<br><br><strong>2. Let Your Fertility Specialist Know the Treatment Worked</strong><br>If you’ve used assisted reproduction, your specialist will probably want to see you immediately. He or she may monitor the very earliest stage of your pregnancy. For instance, the infertility specialist may want to schedule an ultrasound to check on the baby’s development. He or she may also prescribe medications or hormone supplements, depending on the cause of your infertility. “In most IVF cases, there are specific medications which will be required through the initial period of pregnancy, the most common being progesterone supplementation,” says Lee C. Kao, M.D., Ph.D., co-director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.<br><br><strong>3. Have Your Medications Checked Out</strong><br>Certain medications taken by a mother can harm a developing fetus. For example, the acne drug Accutane, the psoriasis drugs Tegison and Soriatane, and several blood pressure medications can cause birth defects or low birth weight. Ideally, you should have spoken to your doctor before conceiving regarding any medications you take, but if you haven’t already done so, do it now. Don’t forget to mention any herbal supplements or megadoses of vitamins you take; some of these can cause pregnancy problems, too.<br><br><strong>4. Start Taking a Daily Prenatal Vitamin Containing Folic Acid</strong><br>Studies show that folic acid, a B vitamin, helps prevent birth defects of the brain and spinal cord if taken early in pregnancy, when the baby’s neural tube is developing. Begin taking a vitamin with folic acid as soon as you know you’re pregnant, or even better, start taking it while you’re trying to conceive and continue it throughout your pregnancy. These vitamins are available by prescription and over-the-counter. According to the March of Dimes, if all women took adequate folic acid supplementation—400 micrograms every day—starting before conception and continuing throughout the first several months of pregnancy, the number of babies born with a neural tube defect could drop by as much as 70 percent. Folic acid is also found in foods such as lentils, asparagus, spinach, black beans, peanuts, orange juice, enriched breads and pasta, romaine lettuce, and broccoli, but the best way to ensure that you’re getting enough is to take a supplement.<br><br><strong>5. Pay Attention to How Much You Eat</strong><br>You will need to eat for two, but that doesn’t mean you can load up on junk food. If you are at a normal weight when you conceive, you should gain between 25 and 35 pounds during pregnancy. That translates to about 300 extra calories a day—the equivalent of a glass of skim milk, a piece of fruit, and a slice of whole-wheat bread. (Calcium is more important than ever during pregnancy, so try to spend some of those extra calories on calcium-rich foods such as milk, cheese, and yogurt.) If you are overweight prior to conception you should gain no more than 15 to 25 pounds, and if you are underweight, you should gain no less than 28 to 40 pounds.<br><br><strong>6. Pay Attention to What You Eat</strong><br>Certain foods can put your baby at risk. To be safe, avoid fish that may contain high levels of mercury (swordfish, shark king mackerel, and tilefish); eat no more than six ounces of albacore tuna per week; avoid raw fish, undercooked meat and eggs, and unpasturized cheese, fruit juice, and milk; eat sprouts only if they are cooked; and either stay away from cold cuts and hot dogs or make sure they’re cooked thoroughly before you eat them.<br><br><strong>7. Cut Down on Caffeine</strong><br>Excessive caffeine intake may increase the risk of miscarriage, so ingest no more than 300 mg of caffeine a day—the amount of caffeine found in approximately two 8-ounce cups of coffee or two cups of tea per day.<br><br><strong>8. Eliminate Alcohol</strong><br>Drinking during pregnancy can cause physical and mental birth defects. “We don’t know how much alcohol is harmful, so the best advice is to drink none at all,” advises Siobhan Dolan, M.D., assistant medical director of the March of Dimes.<br><br><strong>9. Stop Smoking and Using Recreational Drugs</strong><br>They put your baby at risk for birth defects, premature birth, and death.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br><strong>10. Use Caution Around Chemicals<br><span style=""font-weight: normal;"">Avoid solvents, paints, paint thinners, pesticides, and chemicals such as mercury, benzene, and formaldehyde, which can cause birth defects or miscarriage. And stay away from the cat’s litter box to avoid exposure to toxoplasmosis.</span></br></strong><strong>11. Get an OK for Exercise</strong><br>If you exercised before conceiving, it’s probably fine for you to continue the same exercise program—but be sure to check with your doctor first in case you have special medical problems that preclude exercise. If you are otherwise healthy, your doctor will probably give you the thumbs-up to keep walking, jogging, swimming, doing yoga, taking low-impact aerobics classes, or doing other moderate exercise. If you’ve been sedentary, however, now’s not the time to take up a vigorous new sport. Ease into exercise with short walks or gentle yoga, provided your doctor approves.<br><br><strong>12. Use Your Own Good Judgment</strong><br>If you’re worried that something you do might cause a miscarriage, even if your doctor says it won’t—jogging, for example, or drinking coffee with breakfast—then don’t do it. “You need to be able to look at yourself in the mirror and say, ‘I did everything I could to sustain this pregnancy,’” says Gilbert Haas, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at the Center for Reproductive Health in Oklahoma City. “Even if it’s not a high-risk pregnancy, it is a precious pregnancy. You need to be able to not blame yourself if something goes wrong.”<br><br>To find out more, call 1-800-672-2296 or go to <a href=""http://www.americanpregnancy.org"">www.americanpregnancy.org</a>.<br><br><br><em>This article was originally published in the Premiere Issue of </em>Conceive Magazine<em>.</em></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>"
 Ask Dr. Sears: Raising a Vegetarian Child,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-raising-a-vegetarian-child,"<strong>Q. My daughter-in-law is raising my granddaughter to be a vegetarian. The baby is only 13 months old. Is that <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">healthy</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> for her at such a young age?<br><br>A. </br></br></strong>Yes, it can be  -- but only if your daughter-in-law observes certain nutritional precautions. It also depends on what you mean by vegetarian. Being a strict vegetarian (or a vegan) who avoids all foods of animal origin, including eggs, dairy products, fish, meat, and poultry, is very risky in kids because such diets can be too low in nutrients necessary for growing children. But in my opinion, a pesco-vegetarian diet that includes fish, dairy products, and eggs, yet excludes meat, can be extremely healthy for children of all ages. Here are the precautions your daughter-in-law should observe:<br><br><strong>Supplement with omega 3s.</strong> A strictly vegan diet is deficient in omega 3s, healthy fats that are important for growing bodies and growing brains. A child's first source of omega 3s is breast milk, which is rich in DHA, the prime brain-building fat. After weaning, seafood is the richest source of DHA, especially in the form of coldwater fish like wild salmon. Vegans sometimes argue that you can get DHA from plant sources, such as flax and canola oils, but this is not strictly biochemically correct. While there are omega 3 fats in plant foods, the body has to go through a lot of biochemical changes to convert plant omega 3's into brain-building DHA. If your daughter-in-law should give your granddaughter a plant-form DHA supplement, algae-source DHA is a beneficial one. <br><br><strong>Guard against vitamin deficiencies.</strong> While children can grow optimally on a diet of grains, greens, fruits, and vegetables, it's nutritionally risky. To make sure your granddaughter's diet is adequate in B-vitamins, especially B-12, have your daughter-in-law write down everything the child eats for a week and consult a professional nutritionist for what is called a nutritional analysis. This computer analysis of a weekly diet will reveal whether the child is getting adequate vitamins, minerals, fats, and proteins. In my practice, I recommend that all vegans have a periodic nutritional analysis. <br><br><strong>Mind your minerals.</strong> While kids can get enough calcium from plant foods, such as fortified orange juice, tofu, figs, whole grains, collard greens, and spinach, vegans are at risk for being deficient in two minerals: zinc (important for a high-functioning immune system) and iron (important for building healthy blood and brains). The best plant sources of iron are tofu, iron-fortified cereals, legumes, lentils, and beans, and the best vegetarian sources of zinc are tofu, artichokes, chick peas, beans, and zinc-fortified cereals. Nevertheless, it's difficult for children on a vegetarian diet to get the recommended daily 10 milligrams of zinc. <br><br>For the sake of nutritional safety, I recommend that all vegetarian children take a daily multivitamin/multimineral supplement, as well as omega 3 supplements. For more information, you may want to ask your daughter-in-law to read the chapter ""Raising a Healthy Vegetarian"" in my book <a href=""http://www.instore.com/instore/ppesearch?&amp;k=The+Family+Nutrition+Book+sears"" target=""_new"">The Family Nutrition Book</a>.<br><br>Remember, advising a daughter-in-law on the feeding of her own child is a tricky business. It's essential that you be both politically and nutritionally correct. And stay positive  -- she is, after all, instilling healthy eating habits and a love of fruits and vegetables in your grandchild.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>"

Puzzled, a full body X-ray followed and even more unexplained broken bones were discovered.The parents—who couldn't provide an explanation—were taken from the hospital in handcuffs and subsequently <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/news-break/mom-arrested-abuse-and-publicly-shaming-child-t-shirt;"">charged with felony child abuse</a>, while their three children were removed from their home and placed on a fast track to adoption.""The unexplained fractures are stand-alone <a href=""http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/news/local/2015/11/09/unbroken-family-reunited-following-abuse-case/75461030/"" target=""_blank"">evidence of physical abuse</a>,"" the state Department of Children and Families concluded at the time.""That's when the world just fell,"" Bornhorst told First Coast News. ""<a href=""http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/news/local/2015/11/09/child-abuse-or-bone-disorder/75456352/"" target=""_blank"">We wanted help. No one helped us</a>. They didn't ask me about my pregnancy. No medical history. Nothing.""So after she bonded out of jail, Bornhorst took matters into her own hands and began digging for answers. An unusual set of labs led her to discover that her baby has a metabolic bone disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and vitamin D deficiency. Symptoms include double-jointedness, easy bruising, and yes, bone fragility. And it turns out, Bornhorst has it, too.Dr. Michael Holick, a researcher at Boston University Medical Center, director of the Bone Health Care Clinic at Boston Medical Center, and an expert on Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and vitamin D deficiency, testified at Bornhorst and Meade's trials.""For me, <a href=""http://www.firstcoastnews.com/story/news/local/2015/11/09/child-abuse-or-bone-disorder/75456352/"" target=""_blank"">that case was pretty cut and dried</a>,"" he told First Coast News. ""The problem is the radiologists and even these child abuse experts, they do not have the expertise in metabolic bone disease, so they don't appreciate the subtleties—what it can do to the skeleton, or vitamin D deficiency. They just see lots of fractures, and they've been taught lots of fractures is obviously child abuse, end of story.""While the case undoubtedly represents a victory for Bornhorst and Meade, it is not one without cost.

The placenta and the umbilical cord are functioning, passing oxygen and <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">nutrients</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> between you and your baby. The cluster of cells that will become your baby's heart -- a mere speck right now -- has already formed, and the brain and spinal cord are beginning to take shape.A home pregnancy test will confirm what you may already suspect--you're pregnant! Other than that things are pretty much the same on the outside, and you don't look any different than you did a few weeks ago. Growing a baby is exhausting work, however, and you may feel a little more fatigued than usual. Most initial prenatal checkups take place between six and ten weeks, so make an appointment if you haven't already.Do take a pass on that glass of wine with dinner. While some experts say the occasional drink won't likely cause a problem, why take a chance? If you're concerned about having indulged recently, you're probably in the clear. Although fetal development is crucial in the first trimester, there's no need to worry if you had a few drinks in the first few days of pregnancy, especially before the embryo was implanted in the womb.If you aren't already taking them, now's the time to start on prenatal vitamins. Even if you regularly eat a diet rich in vitamins and minerals, you could be missing some of the biggies, including folic acid, calcium, and iron. Folic acid, a B vitamin, helps prevent neural tube defects and reduces the chances of a preterm delivery; iron plays a key role in the production of red blood cells that carry oxygen in the blood; and calcium builds your baby's bones and teeth. Good news from a home pregnancy test? Find a creative way to tell your partner that a baby's on the way. ""I set an extra place at the table using a baby dish and spoon set.""--Ruth Gross, Warren, MIIt'll be a few more months before you'll need maternity clothes, but you may be able to snag a few deals now by shopping end-of-season sales at maternity shops and online stores. Resist the urge to splurge, however (although it's understandable considering how exciting it is to be pregnant). You may need to try on certain items such as skirts and pants to find the best fit, which you can't do until you are showing.If you weren't in shape before you conceived but want to start exercising, first get the green light from your doctor or midwife. Exercise boosts your flagging energy levels, a plus during the first trimester when, like many women, you may tire easily. It also strengthens your body to meet the physical demands of pregnancy. Begin slowly with short walks or sign up for a prenatal exercise class, where an instructor can guide you down the road to fitness. Don't know whether to wait or share your baby news right away? It's considered good form to wait until the end of the first trimester when you know the pregnancy is viable. But doctors say once they have detected a heartbeat, you can feel free to tell those closest to you. Already have an older child? That may have some effect on the personality of your new baby. Later-borns are more likely to become artists, inventors, or rebels. They're probably more adventurous and less conventional, since they're often forced as kids to explore new territory in order to compete with older siblings. Want a crash course in how to cope with twins? Learn this crucial tenet and repeat it out loud: Everyone who wants to help gets to do so! Many people will offer to babysit during those early days. Take them all up on it -- and keep your helpers rotating so they don't get overworked."

Head to independent maternity shops; many of them rent evening wear for such occasions.Sip water or sports drinks (like Gatorade) every 15 to 20 minutes during your workouts to replace liquids you lose through sweating. The color of your urine is a fairly accurate indicator of how hydrated you are: If it's clear or pale yellow, you're fine; if it's darker, drink up.You're halfway through the pregnancy and your libido is in overdrive, but sex isn't comfortable because of your growing belly. Try staying on top, which prevents your tummy from getting jostled and takes the pressure off your abdomen. Another position to try is spooning: both of you on your side with him cradling you from behind.Sign up your child now for a sibling prep course, where she'll be able to talk about her feelings and learn how to be a great big sister. Sessions usually last for a few hours and may even include a tour of a maternity-ward nursery.Instead of buying two of everything, save the doubles for crucial equipment like strollers and car seats.

 What to Eat to Conceive,http://www.parenting.com/article/what-eat-conceive,"From baby carrots to pineapple, we ask the experts to weigh in on which foods boost fertility—during every phase of your cycle.<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=129748976&amp;src=id"" target=""_blank"">shutterstock</a>You’re already loading up on organic fruits and veggies, staying away from processed foods and making sure you get enough whole grains, lean protein and dairy into your diet, as well as taking a prenatal vitamin for insurance. But can eating certain foods during different phases of your cycle enhance your fertility? Some experts say yes!“Different phases of the cycle require a woman’s body to produce different hormones and go through separate processes,” says Jill Blakeway, M.S., L.A.c., clinic director at <a href=""https://yinovacenter.com/"">The YinOva Center</a> in New York and co-author of <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Making-Babies-3-Month-Program-Fertility/dp/0316024503/"">Making Babies: A Proven 3-Month Program for Maximum Fertility</a></em>. “So if a woman wants to maximize her chances of conceiving, it is possible to eat foods that are advantageous to each phase.”But since many pre-conception eating recommendations are nothing more than wild Internet rumors, we asked the experts to weigh in on what to eat during each of the four reproductive phases. Want the scoop? Read on.<span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">When your period starts to flow, you may feel crampy, bloated, fatigued and moody. You may also be depleting your iron stores. In fact, the average woman loses 30-40 milliliters of blood over the course of three to seven days. “Iron is attached to the red blood cells, so the way you lose it is by bleeding,” says Elizabeth Ward, M.S., R.D., a Boston-area nutrition consultant and author of </span><em style=""line-height: 1.6;""><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Expect-Best-Pregnancy-American-Association/dp/0470290765/"">Expect the Best: Your Guide to Healthy Eating Before, During and After Pregnancy</a></em><span style=""line-height: 1.6;""> (Wiley 2009).</span>Menstruation is a good time to remember to focus on foods rich in iron, which the <a href=""http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/DietaryGuidelines/2010/PolicyDoc/Chapter4.pdf"">Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010</a> names as a nutrient of real concern among women in their childbearing years. Just don’t view your period as an excuse to load up on double cheeseburgers. “It’s understandable for women who have a failed cycle to indulge—just don’t linger in that place,” says Hillary M. Wright, MEd, RD, LDN, director of nutrition counseling for the <a href=""http://www.domarcenter.com/"">Domar Center for Mind/Body Health</a> at Boston IVF and author of <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/PCOS-Diet-Plan-Approach-Polycystic/dp/158761023X/"">The PCOS Diet Plan: A Natural Approach to Health for Women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome</a></em>. “Have an episode, then try to regroup and get back to setting the stage for a successful pregnancy.”Meat, beans, fish, leafy green vegetables and seeds. Most of these foods are rich in iron, protein or both, which is especially important if you have endometriosis or bleed heavily. And some (like fish, seeds and leafy greens) have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help mitigate cramps by encouraging healthy blood flow. Another tip: eat plenty of bell peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, kiwi, citrus and other food sources that are high in vitamin C. “Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron from beans, whole grains and fortified cereals,” says Ward.Cold foods (if your periods are clotted and painful) and alcohol, caffeine and spicy foods, which can make bleeding even heavier.Steak fajitas with black beans, bell peppers, onions and tomato salsa.<span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">During the follicular phase, your body is working hard to develop a dominant follicle and estrogen levels are on the rise. Unfortunately, women who are struggling with fibroids and endometriosis often have too much estrogen (a condition called estrogen dominance). “Cruciferous veggies like broccoli, kale, cabbage and cauliflower contain a phytonutrient called di-indolylmethane (DIM), which can help women metabolize estrogen better,” says Blakeway. In fact, DIM binds to environmental estrogens like pesticides and hormones in meat and dairy products, helping rid the body of excess estrogen. Just don’t forget to have some olive oil, avocado, nuts and seeds with those leafy greens. These foods are loaded with vitamin E, which is found in the fluid of the follicle that’s housing your egg.</span><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">As you near ovulation, the body needs plenty of B vitamins and other nutrients to support the release of the egg and promote implantation. “Zinc can help with cell division and progesterone production and vitamin C is found in high quantities in the follicle after the egg is released and may play a role in progesterone production as well,” says Blakeway.</span>Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are also crucial during this phase. The best source: omega-3s from fish and fish oil supplements. These EFAs are best known for promoting blood flow to the uterus and supporting the opening of the follicle to release the egg, but guess what? They also open up the tiny blood vessels in your nether regions, which can ensure you’re primed and ready for action. “Fish oil thins out your blood and increases circulation to your body parts,” says Wright. Plus, fish oil boosts the testosterone in your body—yes, women have this hormone too—so you may become aroused more quickly. And who among us couldn’t use a little of that when entering the O-zone?<span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Now is the time to load up on nutrients that encourage cell growth. Beta-carotene, which is commonly found in leafy greens as well as yellow and orange foods (e.g., carrots, cantaloupe and sweet potatoes), helps keep your hormones in check and prevents early miscarriage. In fact, the corpus luteum, which helps produce the progesterone necessary to sustain a pregnancy, is loaded with the powerful nutrient.</span>One food that gets a lot of attention during this phase is pineapple. In addition to beta-carotene, pineapple contains a substance called bromelain, which has been shown to mildly support implantation through its anti-inflammatory properties. “There’s not a lot of research out there for the benefits of eating pineapple during the time of conception, but if you want to hedge your bets, you may benefit,” says Wright. “After all, pineapple is a healthy food with no downside.” Experts discourage taking bromelain as a supplement though because the dose may be too high, and anything that dramatically moves blood during this time could be counter-productive. <span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Think you may be pregnant alrea</span><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">dy?

The new study, a clinical trial that included more than 2,000 participants, followed women who received either fish oil with DHA or a vegetable oil placebo and then assessed their babies.DHA, which is naturally transmitted to a fetus through the placenta in the second half of pregnancy, is thought to be important to visual and brain development, but the study found no cognitive difference in the babies at 18 months, possibly suggesting that full-term babies get sufficient DHA in the womb, and that supplementation was unnecessary. Additional assessments are planned at ages 4 and 7.Although the study didn’t find that DHA made babies smarter, several experts said they would continue to support taking DHA in pregnancy because it did suggest that DHA supplementation in pregnancy reduces the likelihood of premature birth. The study also found that it slightly decreased postpartum depression in women with histories or high risk of depression.Did you take DHA supplements during your pregnancy?"

 Ask Dr. Sears: Combo-Feeding Tips,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-combo-feeding-tips,"A. Yes, it's perfectly fine to mix breast milk and formula in the same bottle. Also, you can both breast- and bottle-feed successfully. However, there are certain rules of the game that combo-feeders have learned. In our practice, when a mother needs to combo-feed (for example, when returning to work), we recommend ways that Mom can continue to keep her milk supply up while giving her baby supplemental bottles. If you choose to supplement without actively maintaining your breast milk supply, you run the risk of your milk dwindling, leading to weaning before you and your baby is ready. Here are a few ways to keep things flowing:Once upon a time, it was considered routine to tell breastfeeding mothers to give their baby a bottle for all kinds of unnecessary reasons, such as ""to get the baby used to it,"" and to give the mother relief from nursing. Studies have shown that this kind of advice undermines the confidence of a mother because it implies that you won't have enough milk for your baby; and that often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The newest trend in breastfeeding-friendly hospital nurseries is to not send mom home with a discharge pack containing formula or give her any advice that suggests that she may not have enough milk. Producing breastmilk is not only a physical experience, it's emotional as well. While you feed your baby, imagine your milk flowing and imagine yourself making lots of milk. If you worry you won't ave enough milk for your baby, you won't.You want your baby to associate you with feeding, and to know that milk is coming from your breast, not a bottle. Your baby should associate breastfeeding with nutrition and comfort. When you must give her a bottle, have Dad or a caregiver offer it.""Frequency"" is the magic word for increasing milk supply. Breastfeeding your baby at least every two hours is an optimal schedule to follow.A couple times a day lie down and breastfeed your baby off to sleep. The relaxing environment of napping with your baby will often work increase your milk supply. Also, <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/crib-sleeping-vs-co-sleeping"">co-sleeping</a> with your baby is another method that is thought to help.Wear your baby in a sling-type carrier as often as you can throughout the day, as proximity fosters feeding. If your baby is inches away from her favorite food, she's likely to eat more often!Finally, remember to take care of yourself. If <em>you</em> are happy and rested, you will make more milk. From the description of your feeding pattern, I'm concerned that if you continue increasing the frequency of bottle-feeding, your milk supply will also continue to dwindle. But if you reverse the trend and think of bottles as a supplement, or in addition to your daughter's primary source of food—breast milk—your supply should at least stay the same, if not improve. I hope you can work out a feeding plan that you enjoy. You're going to spend more time feeding your baby than any other single interaction during the first year—so, enjoy it!"
 Your Breastfeeding Problems Solved!,http://www.parenting.com/article/your-breastfeeding-problems-solved,"<strong>Q. My baby is due in a month, and I'm very eager to breastfeed. However, my nipples are flat, which I've heard can make latch-on more difficult. Do you have any suggestions that will help my baby breastfeed successfully?</strong><strong>A.</strong> While protuberant nipples can make grasping the breast easier for a baby, an infant can certainly learn to nurse effectively from flat, and even inverted, nipples. Try the following latch-on technique for nursing using the traditional cradle hold: Support your baby using your arm on the same side you will be breastfeeding. Her head should be resting in the crook of your elbow or on your forearm. Rotate your arm to turn your baby's whole body toward you, so the two of you are chest-to-chest. During the learning period, it is important that you support your breast using your opposite hand to help your baby stay well attached. Cup your four fingers under your breast, placing your index finger and thumb parallel to your baby's jaws and well behind the margin of your areola, the dark circular area surrounding your nipple. Your baby needs to grasp the entire nipple, plus at least one inch of surrounding areola and breast so her jaws are situated over your milk ducts.With your baby turned toward you, lightly stroke the midpoint of her lips against your nipple until she opens her mouth widely, as if yawning, and then quickly pull her onto your breast. When she is latched on correctly, her mouth will be wide open with her lips flared out (a bit like a fish), her nose resting against your upper breast, and her chin against the underside of your breast. She will not grasp sufficient breast tissue if you try to push your nipple into her mouth or attempt to attach her when her mouth is only slightly open.Some health-care providers recommend the use of breast shells, also known as milk cups, for women with flat or inverted nipples. These hard, plastic, dome-shaped devices can help make the nipple more protuberant by directing it forward through a central opening in the shell. This opening is situated over your nipple, and the device is held in place by a maternity bra during the last month or two of pregnancy. (Breast shells can also be worn between feedings after the baby is born.) Another strategy for making a flat or inverted nipple easier to grasp is to use a breast pump to draw it out before you feed your infant.Don't be afraid to ask for help if you're having difficulty. Ideally, your first breastfeeding session will occur within 30 to 60 minutes after giving birth, when your baby's sucking instinct is most intense and help from a knowledgeable lactation consultant or nurse is readily available.<em>Contributing editor Marianne Neifert, M.D., is co-founder and medical consultant to the HealthOne Lactation Program in Denver, Colorado, and author of</em> Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding.<strong>Q. I developed painful cracks on both nipples three days after delivery. Now, a week later, nursing is still so uncomfortable that I actually dread it. My friends tell me to tough it out, but if the pain continues much longer, I'll quit. Am I doing something wrong?</strong><strong>A.</strong> Most women experience mild, temporary discomfort for the first few days of breastfeeeding, but the painful, cracked nipples you describe at ten days postpartum are not a normal part of nursing. If your baby's doctor or your own is not comfortable examining your nipples and assessing your breastfeeding technique, ask to be referred to a lactation consultant. Even if you have to pay for this service, this is money well spent.Although the major cause of severe or chronic sore nipples is trauma from incorrect latch-on and sucking, other factors can play a part in exacerbating the problem. For example, inappropriate nipple care -- such as overdrying or excessive moisture¿ -- can delay healing. Furthermore, nipple cracks and wounds are easily infected by bacteria or yeast present in the baby's mouth. So first make sure your baby is latched on correctly, then take care of your nipples. Try applying medical grade ultrapure lanolin after feedings or wearing new moisture-retaining, hydrogel dressings between feedings for a soothing skin barrier. In addition, your doctor can prescribe an antibiotic or an antifungal medication if an infection is present.To continue nursing more comfortably while your nipples heal, begin breastfeeding on the least sore side to trigger your milk-ejection reflex. Once milk flow has begun, the baby should suck less vigorously when brought to the second, more irritated breast. Frequent, short feedings are preferable, since delaying the interval between feedings results in greater breast engorgement and a ravenously hungry baby -- a combination that can cause further trauma during nursing.If your nipple pain is so severe that you must interrupt breastfeeding, you can temporarily express your breastmilk using a fully automatic, electric breast pump, which usually is more comfortable than your sucking baby. Use the pump at regular feeding times, and feed the expressed milk to your infant until your nipples have healed.<strong>Q. While breastfeeding my 2-month-old baby, I experienced several painful plugged ducts -- twice on one breast and once on the other. Is there anything I can do to avoid a recurrence?</strong><strong>A.</strong> A plugged duct, also known as a blocked duct or a caked breast, results when one of the milk ducts draining the lobes of the breast becomes partially obstructed. It creates a firm, tender, engorged area of the breast, and often an elongated lump can be felt. Since milk glands are concentrated in the outer areas of the breast, blocked ducts are common near the armpits. If not quickly remedied, a blocked duct can progress to a breast infection known as mastitis (discussed below), which should be suspected whever redness is present.A blocked duct usually occurs when you haven't breastfed your baby often or long enough. Women who produce abundant milk are particularly prone to this problem, and being separated from your infant or going a long time without nursing is another common risk factor. In addition, constrictive clothing, such as a tight underwire bra or straps from a baby carrier that are pulled too tight, can interfere with milk flow.The most effective way to relieve a blocked duct is to nurse your baby as much as possible. Starting several consecutive feedings on the affected side will help, since babies nurse more vigorously and take more milk from the first breast. You can also place your baby so that her chin points toward the plugged duct, a position that will help promote drainage. Warm compresses or a warm shower can trigger your let-down reflex and improve milk flow, and gentle massage of the blocked area is often effective in relieving the obstruction. Be careful not to press too firmly, however, as causing trauma to your breast increases the risk of mastitis. If, for some reason, your breast isn't well drained after nursing, use a breast pump to remove extra milk.Recurrent clogged ducts can be a sign of breast inflammation or low-grade infection; treatment with antibiotics sometimes curbs the problem. Occasionally, a breast lump is mistaken for a clogged duct. Any lump which persists for more than several days should be checked by a doctor.<strong>Q. I returned to work full-time when my baby was 12 weeks old. I continue to breastfeed when I'm with my baby, and I pump at the office. Since I have been back, however, I have had two bouts of mastitis, both in the same breast. What causes mastitis, and what can I do to avoid it?</strong><strong>A.</strong> Mastitis, or a breast infection, occurs in at least two percent of breastfeeding women. Flu-like symptoms are typical -- fever, chills, headache, body aches, and fatigue -- along with an area of the breast that is tender, red, and firm. Mastitis is often preceded by a clogged duct, an infected cracked nipple, irregular or ineffective milk removal, or simple exhaustion. Working mothers often develop mastitis when they are unable to express their milk at regular intervals and become sleep-deprived and physically depleted.Mastitis should be promptly treated with appropriate antibiotics for 10 to 14 days. If infection occurs while you are breastfeeding a healthy baby, you should continue nursing. If you don't, your milk production will likely decrease, making breastfeeding more difficult after the infection has cleared. Nurse your baby on the unaffected breast first, and move him to the painful breast only once the let-down reflex has been triggered. Ibuprofen can help reduce inflammation and pain, and ice or warm packs can provide comfort. If direct breastfeeding is too painful or milk flow is impaired, you should express your milk.Recurrences often happen when an ineffective antibiotic is prescribed or when the course of treatment is too short. The best way to avoid another bout of mastitis: Pump on a regular schedule while you are at work (at least every four hours), and nurse your baby often when the two of you are together. To reduce your level of fatigue, curtail any unnecessary activities, enlist help with household chores, try to get extra sleep, drink plenty of fluids, and eat regular meals.<strong>Q. My first baby was formula-fed, but my doctor is urging me to breastfeed my second baby, who's due in three months. I'm used to seeing how much milk a baby takes from a bottle, and I'm concerned that I won't know if my newborn is satisfied with breastfeeding. How will I be able to tell?</strong><strong>A.</strong> Even though your breasts don't have calibrations, a number of indicators can help reassure you about your baby's milk intake. The most reliable is your baby's weight. Although your newborn will lose a little weight at first, once abundant milk production begins about the third day postpartum, he will start drinking greater quantities of milk and gain weight rapidly. He will likely surpass his birth weight by 10 to 14 days of age. On average, breastfed babies gain about an ounce each day, or nearly a pound every two weeks, for the first two to three months of life, after which their rate of weight gain tapers.Since ""what goes in must come out,"" you should also watch the contents of your baby's diaper. Well-fed newborn babies should have at least four sizable, yellow, seedy bowel movements each day. Infrequent or scant bowel movements, or failure to start passing yellow stools by the fourth day of life, indicate that a baby may not be getting enough milk. In addition to moving his bowels, a well-nourished, breastfed newborn can be expected to wet his diaper after each feeding. The urine should be clear, not dark.Your baby should nurse 8 to 12 times in a 24-hour period with 10 to 15 minutes of active suckling per breast at each feeding. A newborn who has obtained adequate milk will usually fall asleep contentedly after nursing, while an underfed infant may act fussy, suck on his hands, and frequently require a pacifier.<strong>Q. My baby was born a few weeks early and had a lot of trouble latching on to nurse during the first week. Now, at 3 weeks of age, she is still below her birth weight, and her doctor is insisting that I should start supplementing her with formula. I am hesitant to do so, however, as I am afraid that this will prevent her from ever breastfeeding successfully. Is there any other way to get breastfeeding on track after such a poor start?</strong><strong>A.</strong> In my opinion, your breastfeeding problems are not likely to self-correct with perseverance alone. Because of your baby's relatively small size, preterm birth, and poor nursing, I suspect that your milk supply has steadily decreased over the past three weeks. Your underweight baby cannot be expected to build it up on her own. I recommend you immediately focus on making sure your baby receives adequate nutrition and on increasing your milk production. Once these goals have been accomplished, you have a good chance of returning to full breastfeeding.First, breastfeed your baby approximately every 3 hours, for 5 to 10 minutes per breast. Then offer her as much formula as is necessary to satisfy her appetite. In addition, you should use a breast pump (preferably a fully automatic electric pump) for 10 to 15 minutes immediately after nursing your baby. The pump will remove any milk your baby was unable to take and provide an effective stimulus to maximize your milk production. The residual high-fat hindmilk you obtain with the pump can be used to supplement your baby at the next feeding. Your spouse or a friend can give your baby her supplemental milk while you use the pump so as to shorten this triple-feeding process.As your milk supply increases and your baby's nutritional status improves, she will obtain more milk by breastfeeding and require less supplemental formula. As you return to full breastfeeding, wean your child from formula before you end your pumping regimen.<strong>Q. I am breastfeeding my 6-week-old daughter, and my milk production seems out of control. I leak onto my bed at night and soak through my blouse during the day. My baby gulps and sputters her way through her feedings, and sometimes cries in frustration. What do you recommend?</strong><strong>A.</strong> I agree that an overabundant milk supply can be a mixed blessing. While it's nice to know that your baby is getting plenty of milk, leaking is inconvenient, overly full breasts are prone to mastitis, and your baby can feel like she is drinking from a fire hydrant.Try nursing your baby from one breast at each feeding. She should be better able to control the flow of milk as the initial spraying subsides. A few hours later, you can nurse her from the opposite side. (At first, it may be necessary to pump some of the excess milk from the unsuckled breast to prevent engorgement.) Your baby may also find it easier to nurse if you are leaning back in a recliner, so that the top of her head is slightly above the top of your breast.Fortunately, leaking tends to diminish after 6 to 8 weeks, when the capacity of your milk ducts increases to better contain the milk released during let-down. I predict your supply will gradually come to match your baby's demand as she gets bigger. Meanwhile, wear breast pads to help deal with the hassles of leaking.<strong>Q. I had breast-reduction surgery a few years before I got pregnant, and I was advised that the procedure could interfere with breastfeeding. Is this true?</strong><strong>A.</strong> Although little scientific research is available on this topic, practitioners who work with nursing mothers agree that breast-reduction surgery poses a risk to successful breastfeeding. While it is remotely possible that you will be able to provide all the milk your baby requires, it is more likely that your infant will need to drink some supplemental formula in addition to the milk he obtains from you.Although many techniques can be used to perform a breast reduction, the procedure usually requires a surgical incision around the areola, which can cut milk ducts. Disruption of these ducts will partially prevent milk from flowing to the nipple openings.Although you can still breastfeed your baby, your infant's weight will need to be closely monitored after birth. Your baby's doctor or a lactation consultant can determine how much milk he takes from each breast at a typical feeding by weighing your baby in the same clothes before and after breastfeeding. I also encourage you to use a breast pump after most feedings for at least the first week of your baby's life to help maximize your milk production.Even if you need to supplement with formula, your baby will enjoy the pleasures of ""comfort nursing."" Your breasts represent far more than nutrition to your infant. Breastfeeding provides security, physical intimacy, and skin-to-skin contact -- it certainly doesn't have to be exclusive to be of significant value to you and your baby.<strong>Q. I am struggling with postpartum depression, and my doctor thinks medication would help. Can these types of drugs harm my breastfeeding baby?</strong><strong>A.</strong> You are certainly not alone in your struggles with depression; it's the most common psychiatric illness in new mothers. I believe that you will be a happier, more effective mother if you receive treatment. Your baby is likely to benefit as well, since depressed mothers are usually less able to meet their children's needs.While virtually all drugs taken by a nursing mother appear in her breastmilk to some degree, these minimal amounts usually pose no risk to a nursing infant. (Premature or sick newborns may be more vulnerable to the effects of drugs than older, healthier infants.) For this reason, very few medications are actually restricted for breastfeeding mothers. Those that are include cancer chemotherapy agents, drugs that suppress the immune system, and all illicit drugs.While little specific information is available about the safety of commonly prescribed antidepressants during breastfeeding, several studies show that a number of drugs have no adverse effects on nursing infants. Among the newer medications, Zoloft seems to be one of the safest, because very little drug enters the breastmilk, and none has been detected in breastfeeding babies whose mothers had taken the drug. Although many nursing mothers have taken Prozac, it has been found in some infants, and reports have suggested it may cause infant colic, sedation, or insomnia. Whatever medication your doctor prescribes, inquire about its safety during breastfeeding, inform your baby's pediatrician that you are taking the drug, and watch your infant closely for possible side effects.<strong>Q. I was hoping to breastfeed my baby for at least one year, but she is only 7 months old and is starting to refuse to nurse. She drinks bottles of my expressed milk (plus some formula) while I am at work, but when I try to nurse her at home in the evening, she pulls away and cries. I'm definitely not ready to wean, so what should I do?</strong><strong>A.</strong> It sounds like your baby is showing signs of a ""nursing strike,"" which is a sudden refusal to breastfeed. This problem is often seen in babies like yours who have been receiving bottles and may have developed a preference for the ease of bottlefeeding, although many babies have no problem with a breast/bottle combination.I find that a nursing strike is often related to a low milk supply. Since your baby is receiving formula while you are at work, I suspect that you are no longer pumping all the milk your baby needs. Because she gets milk easily from the bottle, your baby may find breastfeeding to be frustrating, especially in the evenings when your supply is typically lower.One of the best ways to get her breastfeeding again is to offer your breast while she is drowsy or asleep. Most babies will automatically breastfeed in their sleep, and many will continue to nurse without protest when they awaken. Never try to force your baby to latch on, however, as this may only increase her aversion to breastfeeding.In the evenings, try to offer your breast before your baby becomes frantically hungry. If she seems frustrated by the rate of milk flow, you may need to give her a little formula to take the edge off of her appetite before she can enjoy the comfort and security of nursing. Whenever she does not breastfeed well, use your breast pump to express your milk in order to keep your supply up."

Yet with big school loans ($35,000 total), two car payments ($700 a month combined), and about $7,000 in credit card debt, they find it hard to live within their means each month, let alone save for the future. ""We both have pretty good jobs, work hard, and don't spend extravagantly, so we shouldn't be struggling so much,"" says Rachel of their paycheck-to-paycheck existence.

The baby was born two-and-a-half months prematurely and nearly died, and as a result the couple prefers to look after Jailyn themselves. ""She's our little miracle,"" says Rachel. ""We came too close to losing her to leave her with anyone else just yet.""Financial planners tend to think car payments should be no more than 5 percent of a family's pretax income, but the Quinns spend nearly three times that amount for their 2002 Nissan Altima and 2002 Buick Rendezvous, which they bought used. To lower those payments, Kevin McKinley, a certified financial planner in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and author of <i>Make Your Kid a Millionaire: 11 Easy Ways Anyone Can Secure a Child's Financial Future</i>, recommends selling one of the cars and replacing it with an older used car purchased outright for no more than $2,000. The rest of the proceeds from the sale can be used to help pay down credit card debt and start a fund for the down payment on a house.The Quinns should then dedicate some of the money they save in car payments to pay off their credit cards at a faster rate, says Ginita Wall, certified financial planner in San Diego, author of <i>It's More than Money</i><span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">—</span><i>It's Your Life!</i> and cofounder of the <a href=""http://www.wife.org/"" target=""_new"">Women's Institute for Financial Education</a>.

If they then apply that same $75 a month to their next high-rate card, a 14 percent account with a $1,000 balance, they'll pay it off in six months rather than nine. Once they've paid off the credit cards, they can start building a house fund.The Quinns spend $80 a month for their home phone and $150 a month for their cells. Getting rid of one or the other or switching to a lower-cost cell service could free up cash for the ""little fun"" that they'd like to be able to enjoy.To explore job opportunities that would make better use of his education<span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">—</span>and perhaps offer a bigger salary and better benefits, like a 401(k) or similar retirement savings program<span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">—</span>John should consider talking to a career counselor, says Wall. Local community colleges often offer low-cost counseling programs.If something were to happen to either of them, the family would go into a financial and an emotional free fall.

Within the space of only a few months, the marriage had ended.She knew she couldn't count on more than modest financial help from her ex-husband, a high school teacher. So she went back to work as a preschool teacher at a local church, a part-time position that allows her as much time as possible with her son, a happy and energetic toddler who loves music and sometimes laughs so hard he can barely catch his breath. She currently earns $8,000 a year and half tuition for Marshall. Her ex-husband pays $450 a month in child support, while both his parents and hers help out with an additional $700 a month.Still, with just $23,500 a year in income, she finds meeting day-to-day expenses a struggle. She has no savings or emergency fund and worries that any unexpected expense could send her fragile budget into a tailspin. ""If the tires blow on my car, I wouldn't be able to replace them,"" she says. The 10-year-old car has 128,000 miles on it.Why not just charge them? Mills was recently the victim of identity theft and has spent several months trying to correct her credit record, but until the case is resolved, she can't obtain credit and has no credit cards that she could tap in a financial emergency.To supplement her income, she's trying to launch a modest crafts business on the web. (She makes memory boxes, which she currently sells to friends and family, earning her an extra $100 or so a month.) Also on the bright side, she just moved into a new three-bedroom house with financial help from her parents, who covered the down payment.She's extremely grateful for their support<span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">—</span>""I don't know what I'd do without it""<span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">—</span>but feels uncomfortable accepting so much assistance. ""At some point, I'll need to stand on my own financial feet,"" she says.With no short-term savings and just $200 in her checking account, she rightly worries about how she'd come up with cash in a crisis. Fortunately, she has some recourse: 57 shares of stock that were a gift from her father. Selling it all now would yield about $2,500, which she can put in a money-market account to use if and when needed, says McKinley. Mills can further prepare for a crunch by opening a home equity line of credit. In her case this would give her up to $17,000 to tap in an emergency, but she won't pay any interest or fees unless she actually needs money and draws on the credit line.She must continue to check her credit reports regularly to make sure the errors have been corrected. One way she can start to rebuild a good record, McKinley suggests, is to get a debit card tied to her checking account that she can use to pay for things here and there to demonstrate that she can use plastic responsibly. She might also look into getting a secured credit card, linked to her new money-market account<span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">—</span>banks are more likely to issue credit if the debt is secured by a tangible asset, like a linked account.Her low income means she may be able to wipe out any federal taxes she owes by claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit, says McKinley. This reduction was available to qualifying families and individuals with incomes under $33,692 for 2004. (For more information, go to <a href=""https://cms.worldpub.net/cms/editlet/www.irs.gov"" target=""_new"">www.irs.gov</a>.)Both planners encourage her to stick with her efforts to build her memory-box hobby into an online business to earn extra cash. The cost of the marketing effort is minimal, and the potential payoff in added income is much needed. Once Marshall is a little older and in school for longer periods, Mills might also consider looking for a higher-paying teaching job or perhaps start tutoring students as a sideline to bring in extra money.Given their financial situation, Marshall is likely to qualify for scholarships and low-cost loans for college, so both planners urge Mills to put away any money she's able to save for her own retirement. Even little bits help over many years: $25 a month, earning 8 percent in a tax-deferred account like an IRA, will grow to nearly $60,000 by the time Mills turns 65.<b>Name:</b> Brandi and Jason Grant<br><b>Children:</b> Randee, 7, Kelsey, 3, and Aaron, 1<br><b>Jobs:</b> She's a stay-at-home mom and he's an Air Force staff sergeant<br><b>Income:</b> $24,000, plus housing allowance</br></br></br>This family of five is struggling to get by on a single military salary. ""By the end of the month, we run out of money and start charging the things we need, like food and diapers,"" says Brandi. ""I know we could<span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">—</span>we have to<span style=""line-height: 20.7999992370605px;"">—</span>do better.""The Grants are hardly big spenders. Their only real indulgence is going out for fast food a couple of times a week with the kids. Yet they're close to maxing out their two credit cards, and can only make the minimum payments on their nearly $6,000 combined balance. To help out, Brandi's mom regularly buys clothes for them and the children, but the couple realizes this isn't a long-term solution. Says Brandi, ""We couldn't afford it without my mom, but we can't go on relying on her.""Jason, currently stationed at Albuquerque's Kirtland Air Force Base, is planning on a military career. The couple expect to stay in base housing until he retires from the military, which means they won't be looking to buy a home for 20 years or so. Their current home, a four-bedroom house on base, which comes rent-free with utilities, is not luxurious but is certainly adequate for the family's needs.But while the Grants won't have to worry about housing for a while, they're concerned about their ability to pay for virtually everything else, from mundane expenses like curtains (most of their windows are bare) to unforeseen emergency expenses. This was underscored last year when Jason's grandmother was ill and the couple couldn't afford to travel one state away to see her. ""We rack our brains over our finances every single pay period,"" says Brandi, ""but we feel like we're just stuck.""With the average rate on new car loans recently below 7 percent, the Grants should thoroughly investigate whether they can do better than the 11.25 percent rate they're currently paying for the loan on their $22,000 Dodge Caravan, says McKinley. If they are able to refinance their loan, this move alone could free up more than $50 a month.They should write down every penny they spend for the next month or so to get a handle on how the small expenses add up, says McKinley. For instance, Brandi estimates that the family spends about $175 a month eating out twice a week. It's tough to make sacrifices, but if they can cut these meals to once a week, they'll save roughly $90 a month.The Grants currently tithe $200 a month to their church. If this is something they feel strongly they must continue, they ought to figure out how to boost their income by that much. Wall suggests Brandi investigate doing some work directly for the church and then tithing her earnings right back to it.The Grants should use the extra few hundred dollars a month these moves will free up to aggressively pay down their credit card debt, says Wall. Then they can apply that same money to longer-term savings goals, like setting up an emergency fund, college savings, and an IRA for Brandi (Jason will receive a military pension, so saving for his retirement is less urgent).Every parent needs to write a will that names a guardian for their children and details how they want their assets bequeathed if either or both were to die prematurely. (Simple wills can be drawn up using computer software programs for less than $50; lawyers typically charge at least several hundred dollars.) ""Disregarding the potential for tragedy, which is easy to do when you're young, doesn't make tragedy less likely to happen, but it does ensure that your family's pain would be financial as well as emotional,"" says McKinley. ""Taking measures that will protect the people you love is a tremendous gift to give them."""
 12 Fun Baby Learning Games,http://www.parenting.com/article/baby-learning-activities,"Simple, entertaining activities for infants that improve learning and development—even during grocery runs and snacktime!Tom Merton for Getty ImagesYes, we're grateful for healthy, happy babies. But don't we all want our kids to be <em>brilliant</em> too? I do. I'm not talking about the level of genius that lands national talk-show appearances or gains early admission to Harvard. I'd just like my boys to be blessed with brains that let them breeze easily through life: little struggle, lots of opportunity.As it turns out, we parents have a hand in making that happen — and not just in the genes we pass along. Science clearly shows that baby's brain development depends, largely, on his early experiences and <em>not</em> experiences with fancy DVDs or brain-enhancing toys. “<em>You</em> are the best toy in the room,” says Gina Lebedeva Ph.D., director of translation, out-reach and education at the University of Washington's Institute for Learning &amp; Brain Sciences. “Our brains have evolved to learn from other brains.”Simply engaging with baby in positive, everyday ways helps her build the trillions (yes, trillions!) of brain connections that lead to language development, problem-solving skills and the emotional IQ that's so important for getting along — and ahead! — in the world. But if it feels like school, you're trying too hard. The key is to have fun with your little one as you help her to see — and hear, smell, feel and taste — how incredibly interesting everything around her is. Try these 12 easy and fun baby learning activities you can use on the go and during snacktime or playtime.Narrating your day helps baby pair words with what he's seeing, says Kathy Gruhn, a speech-language pathologist and author of <em>My Baby Compass</em>. Speak slowly, simply and in that higher-pitched “child-directed speech” that slips out naturally (research shows it enhances baby's learning). Feel ridiculous talking to yourself? Don't, because you're not. Months before they talk, babies understand much of what you're saying and may even start making incredible connections. Take it from Hillary Homzie, a mother of three boys in Napa, California. “When my oldest was 6 months old, I got a job writing a travel book on Philadelphia and took my son on my trips — to the aquarium, the insect museum, the Italian market,” says Homzie. “I narrated everything. At 14 months, he pointed to pasta at a farmer's market and said ‘money noodles.’ I realized I'd told him about penne: ‘penny’ ‘money.’”If you're on a walk and hear a dog, ask your baby, “What do you hear?” suggests Gruhn. Then give the answer: “Dog. Bark. Ruff! Ruff!” Do this every time you encounter a barking dog and your child will probably start answering with the sound (Ruff! Ruff!), says Gruhn. Eventually, he'll refine his response to “dog.” Try a similar approach to teach him about physical sensations. If it starts drizzling while you're out, before you run for cover, let him experience the mist on his face. He won't melt. Say, “Feel the rain. Rain. Wet.” Then cover the stroller and hustle home.Smiling and waving to the man bagging your groceries not only teaches baby cause and effect (he smiles and waves back), it also helps develop baby's social IQ. “Children watch you for cues on how to interpret a situation,” says Claire Lerner, director of parenting resources for Zero to Three, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that promotes the health and development of infants and toddlers. “Waving and smiling are friendly things you do when you see someone you like.” You don't have to parade around town like a politician, just remember that your little one is watching and learning from every interaction.Babies' brains process new information most efficiently when they're in familiar surroundings, says Lebedeva. “Then, the brain can go into autopilot and take in only the new details,” she says. Try variations on common themes. For instance, go for a walk every day at the same time but switch up your route. “There is a predictability in our near-daily walk that is very reassuring to my son,” says Meg McElwee, mother of two in Durham, North Carolina. “He delights in seeing the neighborhood cats. It must be fascinating for a baby to realize that there are so many different cats, to begin to understand ‘cat' as a category.”Giving your child a chance to respond — even with a smile — is important. “What a child gets from that,” says Lebedeva, “is ‘Wow, what I have to say is important.’” It also teaches the concept of give-and-take. Reinforce the idea of reciprocity by playing back-and-forth with a spoon or cup: You ask for it by name, she gives it you, you thank her and give it back.Sign language offers a visual cue (concrete) to spoken word (abstract). Plus, “There are about 80 muscles in the mouth and face that need to develop before you can speak,” says Gruhn. “It takes at least a year for those muscles to develop, whereas the muscles needed to make a simple sign develop pretty quickly.” At 1 year, my son can't say “milk,” but he can sign it and point to his cup. When I sign and say “milk” back then give him the cup filled with it, he laughs and claps, clearly psyched to have gotten his point across. Other useful signs to try: please, thank you, more, all done. Learn these simple signs and others at<a href=""http://babysignlanguage.com/"">babysignlanguage.com</a>.As early as 4 1/2 months, babies have a “number sense” that allows them to notice changes in the number of objects in front of them, according to research out of Harvard University. Count out Cheerios or peas as you place them in a line on his tray. As he nears 2, show him how to categorize food by color. When her children were about that age, Donna Kaplan, a mother of three in Albuquerque, New Mexico, started showing her children how to sort a small handful of M&amp;Ms. If you keep candy off-limits, try this with colored Goldfish crackers.When she tosses her cup to the floor, say, “Oops, you threw it <em>down</em>,” and, as you lift it, say, “So we have to pick it <em>up</em>.” Getting messy and tossing things around is how babies learn. “You're looking at a little scientist,” says Lebedeva. “Scientists ask, ‘What will happen if … ?’” Your little one isn't just testing what will to happen to the beans when she bombs them to the floor but also how you'll react. Before you correct her, ask yourself: Is this rule (such as “no playing with your food”) really necessary? Research shows when parents say things like “don't” or “no,” baby's language is slower to develop because “these commands inhibit exploration,” says Lebedeva.Show him how a toy works, then back off. “When you see your child struggling, resist the urge to fix the situation,” says Mendel Klein, a pediatric occupational therapist in New York City and father of a preschooler. “Eventually, he'll figure out that the cup is smaller than the pot. He'll also learn that, with effort, he can solve problems.” If he's really frustrated, offer emotional support, suggests Lerner. Acknowledge that it's hard, applaud his effort then help guide him to a solution.Yes, shape sorters teach spatial reasoning and problem-solving; so does letting him figure out how to retrieve the ball that rolled under the couch. You don't <em>need</em> to buy brain-boosting toys, says Lerner. Maria Brown of Washington, D.C., knows this well, as her 14-month-old's favorite toys are wooden clothespins and a empty tissue box. “He puts the pins in the box and the plastic insert at the top prevents them from falling out,” says Brown. “Sometimes he reaches in and pulls the clothespins back out. Other times, he picks up the box and shakes away — a homemade maraca!”Some research suggests that, from birth, babies respond to the rhythm and tempo of music and may even find it more engaging than speech. “I love to sing and dance while holding [my 1-year-old daughter],” says Jill Neville of Millersburg, Ohio. “Her giggles are priceless, and seeing her start shaking her head or wiggling to the rhythms cracks us up.” The sheer joy of singing and dancing <em>together</em> is what makes these activities so magical for brain development, says Lebedeva.“With all of the focus on brain development, some parents have turned play into an academic exercise,” says Lerner. “They're so goal-driven that they don't enjoy it. Kids pick up on this.” It's stressful for everyone, and it squashes the curiosity and confidence-building crucial to learning. Let baby take the lead during playtime. If he's bored with books but obsessed with the dog's water, give him his own bowl and let him splash outside on the deck. “Play should be totally pleasurable,” says Lerner.<span style=""font-size: small;"">To retain and apply new information, babies need to sleep after hearing it.</span><span style=""font-size: small;"">It enhances vocabulary, attention span and creativity.

 Kids Health QA: Health Boosters for Babies,http://www.parenting.com/article/health-boosters-for-babies,"Are DHA and probiotics worth it?<span style=""font-weight: bold;"">Q: </span><strong>Are baby products with supplements like DHA and probiotics worth buying?</strong>A: Well, it depends on which supplement we're talking about. DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is a fatty acid that's important for baby brain and eye development (and long-term adult heart health), which is why it's crucial that you both get enough. If you breastfeed -- the best way for infants to get DHA -- and take a supplement yourself (doctors recommend 200 milligrams a day), your baby is most likely getting all she needs. Nursing moms who want to get DHA from food can opt for fish, while women who bottle-feed can use a fortified formula.As for probiotics, they're healthy bacteria similar to those found in the intestines. Most babies have plenty of the digestion-aiding bugs in their bellies and don't need supplementation. That said, I've had success treating both diarrhea and constipation with probiotics, especially those found in many yogurts (look for ""active cultures""). If your baby develops one of these problems, ask your doctor whether using yogurt or probiotic capsules might help."

 Calcium: It Does a Baby Good,http://www.parenting.com/article/calcium-it-does-a-baby-good,"But make no bones about it: Increasing your calcium intake is just as important for your developing baby's health as it is for yours. A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, showed that babies whose moms consumed less than 600 mg of calcium a day during pregnancy had 15 percent lower bone density than babies whose moms got up to 2,000 mg of calcium a day by taking calcium supplements during pregnancy. ""The old teaching was that babies will get what they need, even if (the mother doesn't), but this suggests that that's not true,"" says John Repke, M.D., chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center.There are many different supplements available on drugstore shelves. What distinguishes each is its content: the amount of elemental calcium combined with an ingredient that eases its absorption into your body. Choose your supplement carefully: A new study shows that the body may actually be able to access more of the mineral when it's in the form of calcium citrate, despite the fact that carbonate supplements are higher in elemental calcium. Translation: More isn't always better, especially if you can't use it."

The jury is still out on whether this supplement can actually help women get pregnant, but it has been associated with preparing the body for in vitro fertilization and boosting low ovarian reserves. Before you pick up a bottle at the store, however, it is important that you understand what this hormone is and how it might affect your body.DHEA, or dehydroepiandrosterone, is a hormone that is made naturally in the body. We make it in our adrenal glands and our brain. According to the <a href=""http://www.mayoclinic.org/"">Mayo Clinic</a>, DHEA leads to the production of estrogen in women. After age 30, DHEA levels in the body begin to decrease, which can lead to fertility issues, such as low libido and decreased egg quality. While this hormone has strong ties to fertility issues, a decrease in DHEA can also lead to other conditions later in life, such as Alzheimer's disease, depression, osteoporosis, and heart disease. DHEA supplements are synthesized in a lab and typically sell for less than $20 per 100-count bottle at vitamin stores. However, get your doctor's blessing before you begin taking the supplement because negative side effects are possible.Anytime you tweak the hormone balance in your body, you increase the likelihood of side effects. DHEA's side effects can vary from woman to woman, as well as in severity, but common signs include oily skin and irregular periods. However, if you are having issues with your fertility, irregular periods may already be a common symptom in your life.If you are over 30 and are having problems getting pregnant naturally or with reproductive assistance, it is worth asking your OB/GYN or reproductive endocrinologist about DHEA. Depending on your diagnosis and your course of treatment, your doctor might recommend trying DHEA as a part of your treatment protocol. <a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=154498787&amp;src=id"" target=""_blank"">Shutterstock image</a>"

 Does DHA Really Deliver?,http://www.parenting.com/article/does-dha-really-deliver,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your week<strong>The theory:</strong> This essential fatty acid, which occurs naturally in breast milk, is believed to provide both visual and cognitive benefits to infants -- especially preemies, who need to catch up with their peers -- as they develop. It's been added to many formulas, along with a sister fatty acid, ARA, in recent years.<strong>The evidence:</strong> A flurry of new research is proving that ""the positive effects of DHA go way beyond the period when babies are actually consuming it,"" says Connye Kuratko, Ph.D., a dietitian who researched DHA at Texas Tech University. One study showed that the higher the level of DHA in breast milk, the better newborns perform on a neonatal behavior scale at 9 days of age. Another study found that 2-year-olds who received higher levels of DHA as infants could concentrate and stay on task better than their peers. And yet another found that 4-year-olds had higher IQ scores if their moms took DHA supplements during pregnancy and while breastfeeding.<strong>The conclusion:</strong> Expectant and breastfeeding moms should take DHA supplements, in the form of a capsule or nutrition bars, along with eating about 12 ounces of low-mercury fish a week (for guidelines, type ""mercury"" in the search bar on fda.gov"
 Immunity Boosters for Babies,http://www.parenting.com/article/immunity-boosters-for-babies,"Good germs sounds like a contradiction, but that's what probiotics are, says Jose Saavedra, M.D., associate professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University Medical School. Here's how they can help:<strong>Benefits:</strong> Probiotics restore balance to the digestive system and ease diarrhea (from a bug or antibiotics). Given in the early months, some may even help prevent allergies. One study found that probiotic drops relieved colic.<strong>Where to get them:</strong> Breastfed babies naturally have a higher level of good bacteria. Bottle-fed babies can drink the probiotic-fortified Nestle; Good Start Natural Cultures formula, and Beech Nut's Good Morning and Good Evening baby foods contain prebiotics, a type of fiber that fosters the growth of probiotics. Older babies can get them from certain kinds of yogurt and yogurt drinks (try Stonyfield Farms products). And some doctors recommend probiotic supplements (Florastor Kids, Culturelle for Kids) for antibiotic-related diarrhea. Always talk to your doctor, however, before switching formulas or giving supplements."
 Breastfeeding Problems and Solutions,http://www.parenting.com/article/breastfeeding-problems-and-solutions,"Answers to your breastfeeding problems, including relief for <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">sore</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> or cracked nipples and how to get a proper breastfeeding latch-onBreastfeeding even under the best of circumstances can present challenges, as both mother and baby are learning what to do. Yet, breastfeeding is well worth the effort it takes to overcome hurdles you encounter. Your baby receives important nutritional, immunological, and developmental benefits, and both of you get to enjoy the special closeness of a nursing mother and baby. Here are some common breastfeeding problems mothers experience, and the solutions our personal and professional experience has taught us.<strong>How can I get my baby to latch on properly?</strong>In our experience, the most common breastfeeding obstacle is improper latch-on. A baby who does not take the breast correctly will not get as much milk and will probably give his mother sore nipples. Here's what we tell mothers:First, position yourself correctly. Milk flows better from a relaxed mother, and it's easier to breastfeed your baby if your arms, back, and shoulders are well-supported. Prepare a nursing station in your favorite room with a comfortable chair, plenty of pillows for support, and peace and quiet or soothing music. After you've prepared your body to breastfeed, prepare your mind. Take a few relaxing breaths and imagine your nourishing milk flowing from your breasts into your baby. Help your infant to relax, too. If she's crying, rock and sing to her until she quiets down. If she's sleepy, gently bring her body into a sitting position while saying her name. Babies latch on best when they are in a quiet, yet alert, state.Next, position your baby correctly. Whether you use the cradle hold (baby cradled in your arms lying on a pillow on your lap), the clutch or football hold (baby's body tucked to the side, under your arm, near your breast, neck supported by your cupped hand), or the side-lying position (nursing in bed), be sure that Baby's head and body are turned to face your breast with her mouth at the level of your nipple. Pull her in close -- she should not have to turn her head or strain her neck to reach your nipple.Cup your breast in your hand, with your fingers and palm underneath and thumb on top, well behind the areola. Avoid the ""cigarette hold"" (when the nipple is between your two fingers) because your fingers would be right where baby needs to latch on. Express a few drops of milk. Using your milk-moistened nipple, gently massage your baby's lips, encouraging her to open her mouth wide, like yawning. As she opens wide, direct your nipple slightly upward and toward the center of her mouth, and with a rapid arm movement, pull her close to you, so that her mouth will close down over your areola. We call this technique ""RAM,"" an abbreviation of ""rapid arm movement."" It may sound startling at first to say ""RAM Baby on,"" but it really helps mothers remember two important components of latching on: that they need to move their arm to draw their infant in closer (rather than leaning forward, which can make their backs sore), and that they must move quickly before the baby's mouth closes again.Make sure your baby feeds from the areola, not just the nipple. To prevent painful breastfeeding, her gums should take in a one-inch radius around the nipple as she latches on. Compressing this area allows your baby to get more milk, since the milk sinuses are located under the areola.<em>Contributing editors Martha Sears, R.N., and William Sears, M.D., are coauthors of </em>The Breastfeeding Book.<strong>Pinching, Cracked Nipples, and How Much Is Enough</strong><strong>What if I feel a pinching sensation?</strong>While a bit of initial discomfort is to be expected in the first two to four days of breastfeeding, persistent pain usually means your baby is not latching on properly. To improve Baby's latch-on, be sure his mouth is wide open as he takes the breast; both of his lips should be turned out (everted). When your baby takes the breast with mouth open wide, he'll have a ""fish mouth"" look as he nurses, and you should not be able to see your nipple. Be sure your baby's tongue is between his lower gum and your breast. (If you pull down gently on Baby's lower lip, you should be able to see his tongue.) If his bottom lip is pulled inward instead of outward, use the index finger of the hand that is supporting your breast to pull out that lower lip. (You may need a helper to take a peek under the breast and do this for you while Baby is latched on.) This ""lower lip flip,"" as we call it, may be all that's needed to keep your infant from tight-mouthing your nipple.If your baby doesn't get onto the breast well at the first try, take him off (break the suction with your little finger inserted into his mouth) and try again, waiting for that wide-open mouth. Don't settle for a less-than-great latch-on: Be patient, keep trying, and soon your baby will learn exactly what to do.<strong>How can I tell if my baby is getting enough milk?</strong>In the first few weeks, many mothers worry about whether their babies are getting enough breast milk. There's no handy way to measure the ounces going in, and the amount of milk you can pump bears little relation to how much milk your baby is getting from the breast. It's better to watch the baby for signs that he is getting enough to eat. Do you notice a few drops of milk leaking from the sides of your baby's mouth and hear him swallow after every one or two sucks? Does he seem content after a feeding? By the fourth day after birth, your baby should wet about six diapers a day. Pale, almost water-colored urine suggests baby is getting enough milk to stay adequately hydrated; darker, apple-juice-colored urine suggests that he is not. Baby's stool output is another helpful indicator. Within a day or two of your milk coming in, your baby's bowel movements change from sticky black meconium to ""milk stools."" These are yellow, seedy, mustard-colored and the consistency of cottage cheese. Babies between 1 and 4 weeks who are getting enough milk will produce at least two to three of these stools a day, often more. If a lot of urine and stools come out in the diaper, rest assured that enough milk is going in. (During the second or third month, some breastfed babies may have only one bowel movement a day while still getting enough milk.) You'll also observe that your breasts feel softer after a feeding in which baby takes plenty of milk.The bottom line is baby's weight gain. After the normal initial loss of five to seven percent of their birth weight (five to seven ounces for an average 6-pound baby), babies should regain their birth weight by two weeks of age. As a general guide, a baby getting sufficient milk should gain four to seven ounces a week, or a minimum of a pound a month. If you think your baby is not getting enough milk, take immediate steps to improve nursing (a lactation consultant or your doctor can help) and take your child to the pediatrician every few days.<strong>What if I have cracked nipples?</strong>Cracked nipples are usually caused by improper latch-on. When your baby doesn't get enough breast tissue into his mouth, all the sucking pressure is concentrated on the nipple.Try feeding Baby first on the side that is the least sore. Usually the most uncomfortable part of a feeding is the minute or two of sucking it takes to trigger your milk-ejection reflex. Once the milk is flowing freely, nursing will probably be more comfortable. Mothers with sore nipples are often tempted to nurse less frequently, but this aggravates the problem, since your breast can become engorged, making it more difficult for Baby to latch on. Try to feed <em>more</em> frequently while being vigilant about proper latch-on. After nursing, you can massage medical-grade ultrapure lanolin ointment onto the cracked area. If the crack does not improve within a day or two, call a lactation consultant. If it becomes infected (if your baby has thrush, for example, the yeast can infect your breasts), your doctor can prescribe medication.<strong>Clogged Ducts and Feeding After C-Section</strong><strong>How do I handle a clogged milk duct?</strong>If you notice a tender lump somewhere in your breast, it may mean that a duct leading from the milk-producing glands to the nipple is blocked with milk. Untreated, the area can become inflamed and even infected (a condition called mastitis). To treat a clogged duct, apply warm moist compresses to the area for a few minutes before feeding. Breastfeeding on the sore side first often helps, as your baby is more likely to dislodge the plug at the beginning of a feeding when her sucking is strongest. As Baby nurses, gently massage the area down toward the areola to encourage the plug to clear. If you start to develop flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, body aches, and fatigue), you may have mastitis. Your doctor can prescribe antibiotics.Plugged ducts are most likely to occur when your infant is nursing less often -- if you're away from home, or when she suddenly begins to sleep for longer stretches at night. To prevent them from recurring, breastfeed frequently, especially if your breasts feel full. (If your baby isn't hungry, pump and store the milk.) Feeding your baby in different positions also helps. Avoid tight bras and sleeping on your stomach, as both can put unnecessary pressure on your breasts. Most important, get adequate rest: Recurrent mastitis can be a sign of a run-down immune system.<strong>I'm scheduled for a c-section. How will I breastfeed during my recovery?</strong>After a cesarean birth, your body must be allowed to heal while you learn to care for your baby and breastfeed. You need extra help: Ask the nurses or your lactation consultant for help with early feedings, and have them show your partner how to help you get positioned for nursing. Breastfeed in the side-lying and clutch-hold positions to keep Baby's weight off your incision. Use lots of pillows: If you nurse lying down on your side, you'll need two pillows behind your back, a pillow between your knees, one under your head, and one to support baby on his side. Wedging a ""tummy pillow"" between the bed and your abdomen can help keep the pressure off your incision. You can also nurse while sitting up in bed; a day or two after surgery, you may be more comfortable nursing while sitting up in a chair, with your infant on pillows in your lap. Some mothers mistakenly assume that they should refuse pain medication, but there are medications that are safe for breastfeeding moms to take. Pain will only suppress your milk production and keep you from enjoying your first few days with your new baby. The anesthesiologist can give you a long-acting anesthetic immediately after the birth to ease postoperative pain when you are first holding and nursing your baby. It may take a bit longer for your milk to come in following a cesarean birth, and longer for the baby to learn to latch on, but mothers who have surgical births can be just as successful at breastfeeding as mothers who deliver vaginally.<strong>Supplements and Biting</strong><strong>What if I need to supplement with formula?</strong>""Combo feeding"" (breastfeeding and supplemental formula) can work, but it's important to get breastfeeding off to a good start for a few weeks before introducing commercial nipples. Otherwise, babies can become ""nipple confused,"" which means they try to suck at the breast the way they get milk out of a bottle. This is not very effective, and it can be painful! If formula supplementation is medically necessary within the first month, a lactation consultant can help you try supplementing with a syringe or a nursing supplementer, a handy device that delivers breast milk or formula through a flexible tube attached to your nipple, while baby breastfeeds. Supplementers help babies learn to suck from a mother's nipple. As an added perk, mother gets the milk-making hormonal stimulation as Baby sucks at her breast.Breastfed babies sometimes refuse to take bottles offered by Mom because it just doesn't feel right. Dad or a substitute caregiver may be more successful at persuading a baby that food can come from other sources. Choose a nipple with a wide base so that baby has to open his mouth wide as he does at the breast. This will minimize problems with lazy latch-on when baby is fed at the breast.Don't take it personally if your baby appears to prefer pumped breast milk or formula from a bottle. It usually doesn't take as much effort to get milk from a commercial nipple. (This is a good reason to avoid them in the early weeks.) If you are planning to combine breastfeeding with formula supplements, or if you find yourself doing this, try to give breastfeeding priority. The more you substitute formula feedings for feedings at the breast, the less milk your breasts will make, and it's possible that your baby's interest in breastfeeding will also wane. Combo feeding works for many mothers, but use some caution or your baby may stop breastfeeding before you had planned on weaning.<strong>Help! My baby bites during feedings!</strong>Babies eventually sprout teeth, with the first ones arriving around six months of age, and when they get them, they experiment with them, which can lead to a startled ""ouch"" from Mom when she gets nipped during nursing. Even though babies do bite the breast that feeds them, you don't need to be a human pacifier. And, this doesn't mean it's time to wean (even toddlers with lots of teeth can breastfeed without causing pain). It is time to teach your baby some nursing manners. It's okay to holler ""ouch!"" when Baby clamps down. To pry your nipple out of your child's mouth without any further damage, wedge a finger in between his gums and hook it around your nipple. If he bites down again before the nipple is out of his mouth, your finger will protect your tender nipple. That startled ""ouch"" may frighten some babies and intrigue others. If your baby cries at your reaction, calm him and immediately resume nursing. If he bites again -- with a curious gleam in his eye -- it's time to end the feeding and do something else together. Eventually, your infant will associate biting with an end to the feeding, and will stop biting. Another trick used by mothers of biters, me included, is to draw the baby in closer to the breast as soon as you feel that first nip, or even when Baby looks like he's about to bite. He'll automatically let go in order to breathe.Breastfeeding requires large doses of commitment, a helping of patience, and a sense of humor. While you may experience some problems, rest assured that with help, you will likely be able to work through these challenges and enjoy this special bond with your baby."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Probiotics,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-probiotics,"<strong>A.</strong> Probiotics are medically defined as organisms in fermented foods that promote good health and establish the right balance of intestinal bacteria. Billions of bacteria reside in healthy intestines where they contribute to the health of the colon. Probiotic supplements are just these same bacteria packaged as supplements in powder or in capsule form.Do probiotics help? Well, when I teach parents and older children about intestinal health, one of my lessons is ""Put the right bugs in your bowels."" It's a symbiotic relationship—these bugs reside in the warm environment of the colon and in return they do the following good things for the body:The resident probiotic bacteria fight any harmful germs that may enter the intestines. Probiotics are now being used in nearly all intestinal inflammatory illnesses.I always prescribe probiotics to be used during, and for at least two weeks after, antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics kill the bad germs that can cause infections throughout the body, but they also can kill the beneficial bacteria in the bowels. Probiotics replenish the healthful bacteria that may have been killed by the antibiotics and restore the balance between healthful and harmful bacteria in the bowels.Studies have shown that probiotics can lessen the spread of diarrhea outbreaks in daycare settings. Probiotics seem to significantly decrease the shedding of viruses in the stools of affected children.These healthful bacteria ferment the soluble fiber in food, producing healthful short-chain fatty acids that nourish the cells of the large intestine, thereby promoting healing of infected intestinal lining. These protective fatty acids are also thought to reduce the development of intestinal cancer and inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria and they travel to the liver where they can decrease the liver's production of excess cholesterol.<br>The health benefits of probiotics have been known for over a hundred years. In fact, in the early 1900s Professor Metchnikoff at the Pasteur Institute in France won the Nobel Prize for his studies relating to probiotics after he noticed the prolonged lifespan of Bulgarian peasants who consumed a lot of yogurt.</br>Probiotics have been used in preventive medicine throughout Europe for many years. They are just now gaining more scientific credibility and popularity in the United States. For example, a study done in 2001 showed that giving probiotics to pregnant mothers with high risk for allergies was associated with significantly decreased incidence of eczema in their babies. This is thought to be because probiotics promote the overall health of the immune system.You may already have probiotics in your diet if you eat yogurt. Many yogurts contain the probiotics <i>acidophilus, bifidus,</i> and <i>bulgaricus.</i> When buying yogurt, be sure the label says ""live and active cultures."" This is the official statement of the National Yogurt Association signifying that healthful probiotic bacteria have been added after pasteurization. Avoid yogurts that do not carry this label. If you are looking for a supplement, the probiotic that I personally prescribe in my pediatric practice is Culturelle, which is <i>lactobacillus GG,</i> the probiotic that has been used in many scientific studies."
 The Skinny on Calcium,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-skinny-on-calcium,"For the fat-burning effect, supplements, fortified foods, and nondairy sources, such as broccoli and tofu, can help, but dairy products are most effective.

Adding it to the public water supply has been shown to help reduce the number of cavities children get.That doesn't mean your kids aren't getting enough of the mineral, though. Many foods and drinks today are made with water that contains fluoride, so your children may be consuming enough of it to compensate. There's fluoride in their toothpaste, and fluoride treatments are part of a routine dentist's visit. In fact, getting too much fluoride can damage and discolor the enamel on unerupted teeth.To be sure, have your water tested by an expert to see how much fluoride is in it  -- check with your local water department or department of public health for details  -- and then talk to your doctor. He'll help you decide whether his prescribing a supplement makes sense."

What causes this?<br><br>A. </br></br></strong>There are lots of possible reasons for gray-looking teeth. Did you take tetracycline or a similar antibiotic when you were pregnant? Doing so can affect the fetus's teeth and cause stains when they erupt.The discoloration could also be due to trauma to the mouth. My eldest child, Michaela, did a face plant in the driveway when she was a toddler and had a gray front tooth until it was pulled later. Other possible culprits are poor dental hygiene (you should brush your daughter's teeth regularly as soon as they come in), food stains, past infections, and medications she's taken, such as liquid iron supplements. Some liver and blood diseases can also cause teeth to look gray. And while it's rare, problems with tooth enamel can sometimes be the explanation.Bottom line: Talk to your doctor to figure out the cause. Together you can decide whether your daughter needs treatment and whether the stains can be removed."
 Relactation: Get Back in the Flow of Breastfeeding,http://www.parenting.com/article/relactation-get-back-flow-breastfeeding,"Breastfeeding tips can show moms how to increase milk supply<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=153936620"" target=""_blank"">Shutterstock</a>When my first child was born, I knew breastfeeding was for me, and luckily my baby girl adapted immediately without any latching difficulties. Unfortunately, my breasts seemed to have trouble producing enough milk, and after a few months, my baby was not getting enough to eat. I was young and didn't know any better, so when the doctor suggested that I supplement breastfeeding with formula, I just did what I was told. As a result, my milk dried up completely, and my daughter was formula-fed from then on.With my second child, I was determined to make a go of breastfeeding again. A few months of nursing went by, and once again, my milk production started to slow. This time, I sought the help of a licensed lactation consultant, who helped me use relactation techniques to increase my milk supply. As a result, I successfully nursed my daughter without trouble for a couple of years. But then I started to feel pressure from family and friends to wean my daughter; I eventually succumbed to that pressure, even though neither I nor my child was ready to wean. The abrupt change in our breastfeeding schedule caused my milk to stop flowing, but worst of all, we were both unhappy. After a couple of months, I found the strength inside myself to try breastfeeding again. I went back to my lactation consultant to brush up on the relactation techniques, and I was able to get my milk flowing again. I ended up nursing my child until she was almost 4 years old. Weaning the second time around was easy because we were both ready for it.If your breast milk stops flowing, or never started in the first place, certain techniques can help you increase your milk supply. These techniques can help if you want to breastfeed again after stopping, increase the production of your milk, or even start producing milk for an adopted baby. According to <a href=""https://www.llli.org/faq/adopt.html"" target=""_blank"">La Leche League International</a>, you do not need to have ever been pregnant in order to begin producing breast milk.La Leche League says, ""Adoptive mothers may be able to induce lactation by using a breast pump every 2-3 hours, either before the baby comes or after. Some also use a device, such as the <a href=""http://www.medelabreastfeedingus.com/products/51/supplemental-nursing-system-sns"" target=""_blank"">Medela Supplemental Nursing System</a> or the <a href=""http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-mDeRb_iGD4"" target=""_blank"">Lact-Aid Nurser Training System</a>. These both enable you to feed your baby while he is at your breast. This way, your baby gets enough milk while stimulating your body to produce your own milk.""When your nipples are stimulated through pumping or nursing, it increases production of the hormones that help your breasts make milk. I used this type of supplemental nursing device when I needed help to restart my own milk flow, and it worked like a charm.According to a study in the <a href=""http://www.bu.edu/cghd/publication/relactation-an-effective-intervention-to-promote-exclusive-breastfeeding/"" target=""_blank"">Journal of Tropical Pediatrics</a>, approximately 92 percent of women taking part in the study experienced full relactation after using stimulation techniques. However, everyone's situation is unique. Issues that could affect your relactation success include:Above all, if you start with a strong desire to breastfeed, that strength can help make your relactation a success for both you and your baby. Begin by consulting with a licensed lactation consultant to discuss your specific situation. She can help you find out why you have trouble producing milk and can teach you how to increase milk supply with a supplemental nursing system. "
 Banish Post-Baby Blues,http://www.parenting.com/article/banish-post-baby-blues,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekWhile pregnant, you dutifully loaded up on folate to reduce the risk of neural-tube defects in your newborn, but now research says there's just as much reason to keep supplementing with the nutrient even after the baby arrives.A new study from Tufts University in Boston shows that folate may play a critical role in staving off postpartum depression. Researchers looked at folate concentrations in nearly 3,000 people and found that those with major depression had lower levels of folate in their bloodstream than those who had never been depressed. Longer-lasting, mild depression (dysthymia) was also associated with low folate levels.""Folate plays an important role in brain function,"" explains Martha Morris, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at Tufts University Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging. ""Low levels of it result in symptoms that can mimic major depression -- including fatigue, difficulty learning, loss of energy, and changes in appetite -- so what looks like depression could actually be a folate deficiency.""Studies show that supplementation with 400 to 500 micrograms of folate a day improves these depressive symptoms and can even make antidepressants work better.So if you're among the 70 to 80 percent of women who feel tired, irritable, and inadequate after childbirth (the baby blues), Morris recommends having a physician check your folate levels. And if you're interested in getting more folate in your diet as a potential mood booster, turn to whole-wheat breads, cereals, rice, and pastas. Thanks to a government mandate requiring folate fortification of all enriched grain products, Americans are already getting an additional 200 micrograms of folic acid daily. Other foods naturally rich in folate include spinach, asparagus, lentils, and beans. You can also continue to take your prenatal vitamins post-baby (many doctors recommend this anyway, especially if you're breastfeeding); that way, you can be sure you're getting the folate you need."
 First Feedings,http://www.parenting.com/article/first-feedings,"Some babies, however, may need an extra boost, notes Marianne Neifert, M.D., Denver pediatrician and author of <i>Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding</i>. If it looks like your baby may be losing too much weight or is jaundiced or premature, talk to your baby's doctor right away. He may suggest supplementing with formula for a few days, Dr. Neifert says. ""The more well-nourished your baby is, the more effective he'll become at breastfeeding.""If you need to supplement, don't worry about ""nipple confusion""  -- the idea that a baby who's given a bottle too early will prefer it to the breast. Nipple confusion is more likely with a baby who is having trouble with the mechanics of breastfeeding, like latching on, rather than a result of a milk supply problem, says Dr. Neifert. It isn't that the baby is confused, but that she discovers where it's easier to get food and gives up on the breast. If your milk isn't in by the third day, tiding your baby over with a bottle may keep her calm and give you some rest. Just keep nursing, says Dr. Neifert, so she stimulates your milk production and practices latching on."
 Immune Boosters for Moms,http://www.parenting.com/article/immune-boosters-for-moms,"Natural ways to fight winter bugs  -- <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">colds</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>, flu, and moreIt's an occupational hazard: Take an on-the-go mom, add one or more germ-carrying kids, stir in sleep deprivation, and brace yourself for the germ <em>du jour</em>. While there's still no cure for the common cold, drinking water (three to four glasses a day), washing your hands often, and getting a good night's sleep can help fend off drippy noses, up-all-night coughs, and more --and the latest research suggests that some natural remedies can be effective, too. Here's the lowdown on what just may work, and what isn't worth your money:Note: Talk with your doctor before taking any supplement, especially if you're pregnant or nursing.<strong>Echinacea</strong><br><strong>Fights:</strong> Colds<br><strong>Prevents or treats?</strong> Both<br><strong>Does it work or doesn't it?</strong> Studies have gone both ways over the years, leaving us snifflers scratching our heads. But in the last year, three different research groups have reviewed the existing evidence and concluded that, in high enough doses, the herb <em>does</em> appear to offer some relief and protection from the common cold. Echinacea may reduce the average duration of a cold by nearly two days, and the chances of even catching one by 58 percent<strong>.</strong> <br><strong>Immune Rx:</strong> During cold and flu season, take an echinacea supplement with at least 900 mg --and no more than 3,000 mg --of standardized echinacea extract daily. Since researchers aren't sure which species or parts of the plant provide the most benefit, look for a supplement that contains a mix of species (<em>E. purpurea</em>, <em>E. pallida</em>, and <em>E. augustifolia</em>) and parts (stems, roots, leaves, and flowers). These aren't always noted on the packaging, so look for a product that <em>does</em> list the species inside. If you're allergic to sunflowers, daisies, or ragweed, avoid echinacea products derived from the stems, leaves, or flowers --they may contain pollen and could trigger a reaction; stick with a root supplement instead.</br></br></br></br><strong>Probiotics (healthy bacteria)</strong><br><strong>Fights:</strong> Diarrhea, urinary tract infections, vaginal infections, colitis and other gastrointestinal disorders, colds <br><strong>Prevents or treats?</strong> Both<br><strong>Taking probiotics may have wide-ranging immune-boosting benefits.</strong> Studies show they may help to prevent urinary tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal yeast infections; they may also prevent or reduce the severity of upper respiratory infections, colds, stomach bugs, and other common ills. In clinical trials, probiotics have proved a potent remedy for both viral and antibiotic-induced diarrhea. There's also good evidence that they can help to induce or maintain remission in gastrointestinal autoimmune disorders, such as Crohn's disease. <br><strong>Immune Rx:</strong> You'll find live bacteria in most yogurt, but while eating it has plenty of health benefits, you'd have to swallow <em>a lot</em> to get the immunity benefits, says Kelly Karpa, Ph.D., author of <em>Bacteria for Breakfast: Probiotics for Good Health</em> --in some cases, at least a couple hundred small containers a day! More realistic: For infection prevention and general immune support, take one to two capsules daily of a probiotic supplement containing a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria. If you have severe diarrhea, increase that to as many as ten capsules daily. <br>Choose a supplement that guarantees a minimum of 15 billion live bacteria through the expiration date. If the label lists the number of bacteria ""at time of manufacture,"" save your money --there's no guarantee those bacteria will still be alive by the time the bottle reaches your kitchen. Select a refrigerated product, and keep it cold. Finally, take your probiotics on an empty stomach, since food triggers the production of stomach acids and bile, which can destroy the beneficial bacteria.</br></br></br></br></br><strong>Garlic</strong><br><strong>Fights:</strong> Bacterial and viral infections (including colds); fungal infections; intestinal parasites; high blood pressure, high cholesterol, atherosclerosis<br><strong>Prevents or treats?</strong> Both<br>In a recent British study, people who took a supplement containing allicin (garlic's active ingredient) daily for 13 weeks in the winter suffered 46 percent fewer colds, were significantly less susceptible to repeat colds, and recovered from the colds they did catch a few days faster than people taking a placebo. Bonus: Many studies suggest garlic may also help to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, prevent atherosclerosis and fungal infections, and reduce cancer risks. <br><strong>Immune Rx:</strong> To resist infections, eat two to four cloves of fresh garlic daily, or (if you're concerned about your breath scaring away more than just vampires) take a 600 mg to 900 mg garlic supplement containing allicin daily. Garlic acts as a blood thinner, so if you're taking a blood-thinning medication or are about to undergo surgery or deliver a baby, consult your doctor before taking it.</br></br></br></br><strong>Exercise</strong><br><strong>Fights:</strong> Colds (and just about everything else)<br><strong>Prevents or treats?</strong> Prevents<br>If you're sick and tired of being sick and tired, exercise may be your antidote: Researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle have found that <strong>women who worked out regularly for one year lowered their risk of colds by almost half</strong>. (""Regularly"" meant doing a moderate-intensity activity, like brisk walking or stationary bicycling, for 45 minutes a day, five days a week.) <br><strong>Immune Rx:</strong> If you can't do that much exercise all at once, aim for 30 minutes and break it up: Steal 15 minutes at lunch for a brisk walk, and another 15 minutes before or after dinner, advises Cornelia Ulrich, Ph.D., senior investigator on the study. ""I try to build in exercise with my two sons where I can, even if it's playing tag or dancing,"" says Ulrich.<br>Just don't overdo it, especially if you feel a cold coming on. Studies have shown that prolonged intense workouts can <em>lower</em> immunity temporarily.[PAGEBREAK]</br></br></br></br></br><strong>The jury's still out on...</strong><strong>Vitamin C </strong><br>It has a long-standing rep as a cold conqueror, and the latest research suggests it may live up to the hype --but only if you're under <em>serious</em> physical stress (even more than the usual mom kind): A recent review of dozens of studies found that a group of marathon runners, skiers, and soldiers who took daily vitamin C supplements cut their chances of catching a cold by about half. For ""regular"" folks, taking 200 mg of vitamin C or more a day shortened colds, but only by about 8 percent in adults and 13 percent in kids. <em>Bottom line: It can't hurt to load up on citrus fruits, OJ, or C supplements, but it may not help, either. </em></br><strong>Zinc</strong><br>Suck on zinc lozenges all you like, but there's no guarantee they'll zap your cold, according to a new review of research on the mineral. True, some studies suggest that zinc does prevent infection and may even cut the length of a cold in half --but an equal number found no infection --fighting benefits. If anything, it's a zinc nasal gel that seems to work best, not the ubiquitous lozenge (and definitely not zinc --containing foods like red meat, since it's nearly impossible to eat enough to see any benefits).</br><strong>Drugstore remedies that <em>may</em> work</strong>From Airborne to Cold-Eeze, lots of ""natural"" products on store shelves claim to fight cold and flu. Here, two backed by seemingly solid research (the studies were funded by the companies that manufacture them and apply only to these specific name brands, not the plants they contain):<strong>Cold fX (Ginseng)</strong><br><strong>Fights:</strong> Colds<br><strong>Prevents or treats?</strong> Both<br>According to a Canadian study, people who took 400 mg of Cold fX --a patented North American ginseng extract --daily for four months experienced 26 percent fewer colds, were half as likely to suffer recurring colds, experienced markedly milder symptoms, and recovered a few days quicker from the colds they did catch than people taking a placebo. It's also been shown in lab studies to bolster immune-system cells. Unfortunately, these results can't be generalized to all ginseng products, since they each contain differing amounts of active ginseng, says Gerry Predy, M.D., who led the study at the University of Alberta. <br><strong>Immune Rx:</strong> You can take up to 400 mg of Cold fX daily during cold and flu season to prevent or minimize infections.</br></br></br></br><strong>Sambucol (Elderberry)</strong><br><strong>Fights:</strong> Flu<br><strong>Prevents or treats?</strong> Both<br>The elderberry plant has been used for centuries in Europe to relieve flu symptoms, including muscle aches, coughing, congestion, and fever. The best-studied standardized black elderberry extract is Sambucol, a patented formula sold in the United States by Nature's Way. According to research from Israel's Hadassah University Hospital, which tested several Sambucol formulas (including an extract, syrup, and children's formulation), it increases production of inflammatory cytokines, chemicals that stimulate the immune system and bolster its ability to fight off invaders. <br><strong>Immune Rx:</strong> If you have the flu, you can take two teaspoons of Sambucol four times daily (or two lozenges, three times daily), for three to five days, starting with your first symptoms.

There’s no baby food pyramid, so we asked pediatrician Dr. Alan Greene what vitamins and nutrients kids need in the first yearOnce your baby is ready to start solids (generally somewhere between four to six months of age, although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months), you may wonder just what kinds of food—and how much of it—to give your baby in addition to her regular diet of breast milk or infant formula.While the U.S. Department of Agriculture has created a <a href=""http://www.mypyramid.gov/preschoolers/"">food pyramid for preschoolers (ages 2 to 5)</a> and another one for <a href=""http://www.mypyramid.gov/kids/index.html"">grade schoolers (ages 6 to 11)</a>, there is no baby food pyramid, which may leave parents confused about what exactly they should be feeding their baby.<strong>Fruits and Veggies</strong>We spoke with Dr. Alan Greene, a pediatrician at Stanford University's Lucile Packard Children Hospital and author of <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470425245/?tag=parentingcom"">Feeding Baby Green: The Earth-Friendly Program for Healthy, Safe Nutrition</a></em>, who says that while there isn’t a specific ratio of veggies, fruits, grains, and proteins that parents should try to feed their babies each day, it <em>is</em> important to ensure that a variety of foods are being offered regularly. Dr. Greene says that he encourages parents to first expose their babies to many different kinds of fruits and vegetables, aiming for something green at every lunch and dinner.<strong>Rice Cereal and Other Grains</strong>As for rice cereal, traditionally a first food for many babies, Dr. Greene has launched the <a href=""http://www.drgreene.com/whiteout"">WhiteOut campaign</a> to get it off store shelves altogether. He refers to the processed white rice cereal as a “gateway junk food,” and recommends a whole grain like brown rice or oatmeal instead. But, he says, “I do really like the idea of the first bite being something colorful they can see, touch, smell, and recognize from a produce aisle or farmer's market,” and suggests foods like avocado, banana, or cooked sweet potato as other options for baby’s first food.<strong>Protein and Meat</strong>Meat can be introduced any time after 6 months. While babies don’t specifically require meat in their diet, Dr. Greene explains that the AAP recommends it as an early food because of its iron content. Poultry, fish and beef can be offered anywhere from a couple of times a week to a daily basis, but babies can also get all the nutrients they need in the first year from breast milk/formula and other protein- and iron-rich foods too if parents don’t eat meat.<strong> </strong>The key is not to get caught up in counting servings but to explore different flavors, smells, and textures during this period of introduction to solid food to head off picky eating habits, says Dr. Greene. Reminder: don’t give your baby honey until at least one year of age because the risk of botulism, or any raw or undercooked food, unpasteurized cheese, or anything that could be a choking hazard.<strong>Plus:</strong><br><img alt="""" height=""5"" src=""http://images.parenting.mdpcdn.com/sites/parenting.com/themes/meredith/images/yellow_bullet_point.png"" width=""5""><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/tags/baby-food""> Easy Homemade Baby Food Recipes</a> <br><img alt="""" height=""5"" src=""http://images.parenting.mdpcdn.com/sites/parenting.com/themes/meredith/images/yellow_bullet_point.png"" width=""5""><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/gallery/baby-feeding-products""> Baby Utensils for Starting Solids </a></img></br></img></br><strong>Biodiversity Checklist:</strong>Want to raise a really adventurous eater? In <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0470425245/?tag=parentingcom"">Feeding Baby Green</a></em>,Dr. Greene includes a biodiversity checklist, listing examples of foods from 21 different families of plants, and suggesting that parents offer at least one from each food family anywhere between 12 to 16 times during the different stages of feeding (spoon feeding, finger foods, and fork/spoon).

Formula-fed babies who consume less than one liter of formula per day (about 34 ounces) should also receive supplementation.Finally, while healthy, full-term babies are born with sufficient iron for their first four months, the American Academy of Pediatrics now advises parents of exclusively or partially breastfed babies to give 1 mg per kilogram of body weight of an oral iron supplement per day starting at 4 months of age and continuing until iron-rich complementary foods are introduced. (Formula-fed babies receive sufficient iron from formula.) Babies 6 to 12 months of age need 11mg of iron per day.Preterm babies who are breastfed should receive an iron supplement of 2 mg/kg daily by 1 month of age and continue until they receive sufficient iron through complementary foods or are weaned to iron-fortified formula.<strong>Plus:</strong><br><img alt="""" height=""5"" src=""http://images.parenting.mdpcdn.com/sites/parenting.com/themes/meredith/images/yellow_bullet_point.png"" width=""5""><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/tags/baby-food""> Easy Homemade Baby Food Recipes</a> <br><img alt="""" height=""5"" src=""http://images.parenting.mdpcdn.com/sites/parenting.com/themes/meredith/images/yellow_bullet_point.png"" width=""5""><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/gallery/baby-feeding-products""> Baby Utensils for Starting Solids </a></img></br></img></br>"
 Ask Dr. Sears: From Bottle Back to Breast,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-from-bottle-back-to-breast,"<strong>Q. Soon after my daughter was born, I started bottle-feeding her with expressed breast <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">milk</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> because breastfeeding was very painful for me. I have decided to try nursing again, but I'm worried I made a mistake by switching from breast, to bottle and now back to breast again. Is this harmful to my milk supply? And will switching back and forth confuse my daughter?<br><br>A. </br></br></strong>Congratulations on your decision to try breastfeeding again. It often takes a mother and baby at least a couple weeks of exclusive breastfeeding to establish a feeding rhythm that's comfortable for Mom and produces enough milk for baby. I want to reassure you that it's worth attempting to overcome whatever obstacles you may encounter to establish a good breastfeeding relationship.New studies have shown that the length and frequency babies are breastfed correlates with the high cognitive skills and good health they experience as they grow. While it's true that your daughter may have initially been confused by the breast-to-bottle back-and-forth, you certainly need not worry that she has been harmed in any lasting way. What's important is that she was still getting your pumped breast milk. To get back to exclusive breastfeeding and lessen the use of supplemental bottles, try the following:<strong>Teach baby a comfortable latch-on.</strong> Are you allowing baby to put too much sucking pressure on the nipple, rather than the areola (the darkened area surrounding your nipples)? This is the most common cause of painful nursing and may be why you've encountered problems. You need to get baby to open her mouth as wide as possible. Use your index finger to depress her lower jaw. When her mouth is open wide, quickly offer the breast while ensuring that her lips and gums are putting sucking pressure above your nipple. This not only makes latch-on less painful for you, but allows baby to get the most milk.Another problem may be that baby's lips are tight or pursed while she nurses. This can lead to sore nipples. Try the ""lower lip flip,"" a trick my wife (a lactation consultant) used on our babies. Once your daughter is latched on, take your index finger and flip her lower lip outward. This, in combination with baby's wide open mouth, should increase your comfort and nursing success.<strong>Get consultation.</strong> It's now common for pediatric practices to have a lactation specialist either in their office or on call. Consider getting a positioning and latch-on consultation now, before any uncomfortable nursing habits develop  -- it may be one of the most worthwhile things you do as a new parent.<strong>Gradually lessen the number of bottles.</strong> Once you've established an optimal milk supply and a comfortable latch-on, the occasional supplemental bottle is fine. However, I discourage supplemental bottle use unless absolutely necessary, as I find switching between breast and bottle can sometimes causes ""nipple confusion,"" especially during the first month of life. When bottle-feeding, baby can suck any old way she wants and the milk still flows freely. If she's latching onto your breast, on the other hand, she must do it correctly in order to get fed -- thus the confusion. If out of necessity you must combo feed, try to hold off until your baby is past the newborn stage. Once she's older, the likelihood of nipple confusion will greatly decrease.<strong>Think milk!</strong> Breastfeeding can be thought of as a confidence game. While nursing your baby, visualize your milk flowing. Imagine your baby properly latching-on and enjoying your milk, and imagine yourself enjoying your ability to nourish your child. It's amazing how focusing on these positive, motherly thoughts can help you produce more milk.You may find our book, <a href=""http://www.instore.com/instore/ppesearch?&amp;k=The+Breastfeeding+Book+Sears&amp;refe=aol-parenting-c&amp;ref=aol025"" onclick=""window.open('','popup1','height=800,width=600,scrollbars=yes,resizable=yes')"" target=""popup1"">The Breastfeeding Book</a>"
 Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Common Kid Problems,http://www.parenting.com/article/alternative-medicine-children,"The next time your kid has an upset <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">stomach</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> or other common illness, reach for one of these AAP-approved remedies instead of an OTC cureWhat if your pediatrician handed you a prescription for honey instead of an antibiotic? Sweet! While Western medicine has lots of tools at its disposal to treat children, it's not the only option, and more doctors and parents are recognizing this. As many as 40 percent of kids today have received some form of complementary or alternative medicine (CAM). These treatments include oils, yoga, and probiotics. “It's all about integrating complementary therapies that are safe and effective with conventional therapies that are safe and effective,” says Lawrence Rosen, M.D., chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Complementary and Integrative Medicine and a pediatrician in Oradell, NJ.The one caveat: There isn't a lot of scientific research out there for alternative treatments, so parents should use common sense, says Kathi Kemper, M.D., director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at Wake Forest Baptist Health. “You don't need to ask a doctor before using chicken soup or giving your child a massage, but do ask about starting a new herbal remedy,” she advises. Since these supplements are not regulated, Dr. Kemper recommends always choosing products labeled with a USP seal—from the United States Pharmacopeia—which verifies the quantity and quality. How to use CAM treatments wisely:<strong>Issue<em>:</em> Upset stomach</strong><strong>Treatment:</strong><em> </em>Probiotics<strong>Ages:</strong> All ages<strong>What it does:</strong> Probiotics can shorten the life of stomach bugs and reduce antibiotic side effects like diarrhea. Dr. Rosen typically recommends an over-the-counter probiotic supplement like Florastor Kids or Culturelle. Consult your doctor about dosage.<strong>Issue: ADHD</strong><strong>Treatment:</strong> Yoga<strong>Ages:</strong> 3 and up<strong>What it does:</strong> There's no single magic bullet for ADHD, but for many kids, a mind-body technique like yoga gives them a way to move their body and develop breathing strategies that can help them focus and relax, says Dr. Rosen.<strong>Issue: Earache</strong><strong>Treatment:</strong> Garlic oil eardrops<strong>Ages:</strong> 6 months and up<strong>What it does:</strong> “Garlic and olive oil are anti-inflammatories that can help ease the pain of an earache,” says Dr. Rosen. Create your own drops by mixing one tablespoon room-temperature olive oil with one clove of crushed garlic. Put two to three drops in the affected ear every four hours as needed for pain. Contact your doctor if your child develops a fever, there's fluid coming out of the ear, or if the earache gets worse after 48 hours.<strong>Issue: Stress-related headache or stomachache</strong><strong>Treatment:</strong> Biofeedback<strong><em>Ages:</em></strong> 5 and up<strong>What it does:</strong> During a session, the child is connected to electrical sensors while the doctor teaches him breathing and relaxing skills to help ease pain. As the child alters his behavior, he sees the changes show up on a screen, much like in a video game."
 Germs and Kids,http://www.parenting.com/article/germs-and-kids,"Parents often try to make their kids' <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">world</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> germ-free, but surprise: Most bacteria are actually good for us!It's understandable that parents want to keep their children's environments clean, especially when kids are young. Moms wash bottles in hot water, clean pacifiers that fall on the ground, and take dirty things out of their kids' mouths. But overall, when it comes to germs, most people have it backward: With relatively few exceptions, they are good for our kids. Keeping things clean is smart, but going crazy using antibacterial hand soaps, buying antibacterial kids' toys and other products, and overusing antibiotic medications is actually killing off the microbes that can help strengthen the immune system. Antibacterial products may help to reduce some infections, but they also promote the growth of drug-resistant organisms and weaken the good bacteria within us. Rather than focus on killing germs, we need to think about how to encourage their growth.Supporting the “right” bacteria can have a huge health payoff for your kids: fewer ear infections, tummy aches, episodes of diarrhea, urinary-tract infections, and food allergies. It can even help kids fight off coughs, colds, and fevers. Here's how to ensure your kids have enough of the good stuff:<strong>Feed your kids right.</strong> Give them foods that naturally contain helpful organisms. These include yogurt, pickles, dark chocolate, and feta cheese. In some cases , it may be useful to give a probiotic supplement (available at most pharmacies and health-food stores) containing beneficial live bacteria. All of these foods and supplements are fine to give kids starting at around 6 months. There are other foods to include in their diet that don't actually contain good germs but help to nurture them: garlic, onions, asparagus, whole oats, whole wheat, honey (for children over age 1), and bananas.<strong>Make safe and smart choices.</strong> Keep your kids away from cigarette smoke; exposure can kill off favorable bacteria. As for antibiotic drugs, don't insist that your pediatrician prescribe them when he says they're not necessary. These drugs eliminate both good and bad bacteria. If your kids do have to take antibiotics, make sure they get probiotics, too, to restore the body's supply of good bacteria.Keeping the body's bacteria in balance doesn't take a lot of effort, but it can have big benefits. Starting these habits young can help keep kids healthy for life."
 Soothing News About Pacifiers,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/stephanie-wood/breastfeeding-paci,"New evidence that <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">breastfeeding</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> and pacifier sucking can happily coexistBinky fans, rejoice! Increasing evidence is showing that breastfeeding and paci sucking can co-exist.The latest proof, just published yesterday in the journal <em>Pediatrics:</em> A study of more than 2,200 newborns out of the Department of Pediatrics at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) in Portland found that after a hospital stopped routinely handing out pacifiers, exclusive breastfeeding rates actually decreased. Conversely, exclusive and supplemental formula feeding rates increased.Prior to the binky ban, during which pacifiers were placed in literal lockdown and nurses had to enter a code to retrieve one, 80 percent of babies born at the hospital were exclusively breastfed. After the ban, that number dropped to 70 percent. The irony here is that the hospital took this step to receive a “Baby-Friendly” designation.The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (babyfriendlyusa.org) was created to encourage and recognize hospitals that offer optimal support and care for breastfeeding mothers and their newborns. To receive the designation, hospitals must meet 10 criteria, one of which is “give no pacifiers or artificial nipples to breastfeeding infants.”It’s long been debated whether pacifier use interferes with the establishment of breastfeeding, particularly in the early weeks. Lactation enthusiasts tend to support this thinking, insisting that pacifier use (along with supplemental baby bottles) can cause “nipple confusion” and interfere with the development of proper latch-on and suckling technique. Not only would plenty of parents and researchers disagree, but pacifier use has also been shown to have some important benefits in recent years. <strong>Plus: <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/parenting-post/pacifier-policy?cid=plusblog"">One Mom's Love-Hate Relationship With Pacifiers</a></strong>“This subject poses an additional dilemma for parents and pediatric providers as pacifier use is associated with a decreased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using a pacifier for sleep after breastfeeding is established,” notes study author Laura Kair, M.D., pediatric resident at OHSU’s Doernbecher Children’s Hospital where the research was conducted.“Our goal with publicizing this data is to stimulate conversation and scientific inquiry about whether there is sufficient evidence to support the universal recommendation of not offering pacifiers to breastfeeding infants in the first few days to weeks of life.”Did your breastfed baby use a pacifier as well? <a href=""#comment"">Let us know</a>."

I thought that the prenatal vitamin she'd prescribed me earlier didn't have enough nutrients (I did a lot of research on different brands and I asked a few nutritionists too). I also told her that in addition to the prenatal vitamin, I wanted to take a calcium supplement and a <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/parenting/article/0,19840,1608068,00.html"">DHA supplement</a> (fatty acids that have been shown to promote brain development, among other things).""I don't think I've seen a pregnant woman who was calcium deficient,"" she said, ""but it's fine if you want to supplement with it.""Um, you've never seen a pregnant woman who needs more calcium?

The prenatal she prescribed (and I'm taking), by the way, is <a href=""http://www.citracalprenatalrx.com/"">Citracal</a>, which has lots of the nutrients pregnant women need and it comes with a 250 mg pill of DHA from a non-fish source. Since neurologists and nutritionists (including my friends Lyssie Lakatos, R.D., and Tammy Lakatos-Shames, R.D., who are known as <a href=""http://nutritiontwins.com/"">""The Nutrition Twins""</a> ) recommend <em>at least</em> 400 mg per day of DHA in order to boost brain development, I'm also taking an additional 200 mg DHA pill each day called <a href=""http://www.expectalipil.com/"">Expecta</a>, which my pharmacist gave me. And the Nutrition Twins do agree that I should supplement with calcium. So, for future nutrition questions, I plan to get my info from nutritionists (and then just clear it with my doc).But, anyway, the most exciting part of the appointment was that we had our very first sonogram. We couldn't see much, but we did see the flickering white light that signified the heartbeat. Pretty amazing.""It's a good strong, heartbeat,"" said my obgyn. ""That doesn't mean that you won't have a miscarriage at this point, but it means that things are looking good.""I was a little put off by the mention of the ""M"" word right then, but I appreciated the straight facts.""If the heartbeat is still strong at your 10-week check-up, you'll only have a 5 percent chance of miscarriage at that point,"" she added.Okay, then, let's get to week 10.Then, she handed us a printed copy of our sonogram.""It's cute,"" my husband said.When I got back to work, I promptly made photocopies of the sonogram for our parents and my brother and sister-in-law, and sent them off in the mail titled, ""First Sonogram, Baby Pechman."" I felt a little presumptuous writing ""baby,"" since at this point the embryo isn't even called a fetus yet, and a lot could happen between now and then. But, I don't know, I was feeling optimistic. I still am."

Did you take tetracycline or a similar antibiotic when you were pregnant? Doing so can affect the fetus's teeth and cause stains when they erupt. The discoloration could also be due to trauma to the mouth. ther possible culprits are poor dental hygiene (you should brush your daughter's teeth regularly as soon as they come in), food stains, past infections, and medications she's taken, such as liquid iron supplements. Some liver and blood diseases can also cause teeth to look gray. And while it's rare, problems with tooth enamel can sometimes be the explanation. Bottom line: Talk to your doctor to figure out the cause. Together you can decide whether your daughter needs treatment and whether the stains can be removed.   <b>More in Tooth care and Hygiene</b><br><img height=""6"" src=""http://images.parenting.mdpcdn.com/sites/parenting.com/files/imagecache/article_image_center/article_images/1-arrow_right_blue_text.gif"" width=""4""><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Child/Health/When-should-I-start-cleaning-my-babys-teeth"">When should I start cleaning my baby's teeth?</a><br><img height=""6"" src=""http://images.parenting.mdpcdn.com/sites/parenting.com/files/imagecache/article_image_center/article_images/1-arrow_right_blue_text.gif"" width=""4""><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Child/Health/How-can-I-help-my-child-brush-his-teeth"">How can I help my child brush his teeth?<br/></a><img height=""6"" src=""http://images.parenting.mdpcdn.com/sites/parenting.com/files/imagecache/article_image_center/article_images/1-arrow_right_blue_text.gif"" width=""4""><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Child/Health/When-should-we-go-see-a-dentist"">When should we go see a dentist?<br/></a><img height=""6"" src=""http://images.parenting.mdpcdn.com/sites/parenting.com/files/imagecache/article_image_center/article_images/1-arrow_right_blue_text.gif"" width=""4""><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Child/Health/How-can-I-prevent-tooth-decay-in-my-child"">How can I prevent tooth decay in my child?</a><br><img height=""6"" src=""http://images.parenting.mdpcdn.com/sites/parenting.com/files/imagecache/article_image_center/article_images/1-arrow_right_blue_text.gif"" width=""4""><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Child/Health/How-much-should-the-tooth-fairy-give-to-the-kids"">How much should the ""tooth fairy"" give to the kids?</a><br><img height=""6"" src=""http://images.parenting.mdpcdn.com/sites/parenting.com/files/imagecache/article_image_center/article_images/1-arrow_right_blue_text.gif"" width=""4""><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Child/Health/How-do-I-make-sure-my-child-is-getting-enough-fluoride"">How do I make sure my child is getting enough fluoride?</a> </img></br></img></br></img></img></img></br></img></br><b><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Child/Health/Teething-FAQ"">Teething Symptoms</a><br><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Child/Health/Teething-FAQ/2"">Teething Relief</a><br><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Child/Health/Teething-FAQ/4"">Losing baby teeth</a></br></br></b>"

There's fluoride in their toothpaste, and fluoride treatments are part of a routine dentist's visit. In fact, getting too much fluoride can damage and discolor the enamel on unerupted teeth. To be sure, have your water tested by an expert to see how much fluoride is in it -- check with your local water department or department of public health for details -- and then talk to your doctor.

 Hemorrhoids During Pregnancy,http://www.parenting.com/article/hemorrhoids-during-pregnancy,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekMost women would like to pretend that hemorrhoids do not exist. But during pregnancy, they may crop up or become more severe if you're already suffering. Symptoms include bleeding, itching, and soreness in the rectal area.Hemorrhoids (also called piles) occur when rectal veins swell due to increased pressure. ""During pregnancy, hemorrhoids are caused by the sheer weight of the uterus on the veins,"" says Lisa Domagalski, M.D. FACOG, an ob-gyn at Women and Infants Hospital in Rhode Island and assistant clinical instructor at Brown University.Constipation, often a problem since pregnancy slows down the gastrointestinal tract, can exacerbate hemorrhoids. The key to preventing constipation is to drink plenty of water and eat at least two grams of fiber every day -- good sources include bran cereal, apples, and spinach. Your doctor may recommend fiber supplements or stool softeners.To get relief, cleanse with witch hazel pads (Tucks) after a bowel movement, soak in a warm sitz bath, apply an ice pack, and avoid sitting on hard surfaces. Ask your doctor about trying over-the-counter creams, such as Preparation H Hydrocortisone 1% Anti-Itch Cream, that temporarily relieve itch and inflammation.In rare cases, painful blood clots, called thrombosed hemorrhoids, can form inside the veins. If this happens, you'll need to have them surgically removed in a minor procedure before your delivery.But there is good news: ""Hemorrhoids do get better after delivery,"" Domagalski says. ""They can shrink considerably or totally disappear."""
 Health Update: Nutrient Rich Nuts,http://www.parenting.com/article/nutrient-rich-nuts,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekFor a health boost, grab a handful of nuts. They're high in fiber, protein, and some surprising nutrients. Case in point: Just two Brazil nuts (about a quarter of an ounce) deliver as much of the cell-protecting antioxidant selenium as a supplement, according to a new study. Nuts are high in fat (though it's the healthy kind), so avoid packing on the pounds by treating them as a condiment instead of a snack. Sprinkle them on salads and cereal, or toss with steamed veggies, suggests Sarah Krieger, spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association.<strong>Check out how some other nuts stack up per one-ounce serving: 12-16 walnut halves</strong> = 200 percent of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of omega-3, an essential fatty acid (175 calories) <strong>20-24 whole almonds</strong> = 35 percent of the RDA of vitamin E, which counters cholesterol (163 calories) <strong>25-30 pecan halves</strong> = 10 percent of your daily fiber needs, plus a healthy dose of oleic acid, a cholesterol-fighting fat (196 calories)."

What to watch for? Stools so loose they sink into the diaper, says Jolanda White, M.D., a pediatric gastroenterologist at Columbus Children's Hospital in Ohio. Here's the lowdown on what's up with all that doo-doo:<strong>When to call the doc:</strong> Anytime a baby younger than 2 months has diarrhea, when you see blood in the stools, or when the diarrhea lasts more than eight hours. Be on the lookout for dehydration; the first clue is fewer wet diapers. If you see a sunken soft spot, head for the E.R.<strong>How to treat it:</strong> Continue to nurse or give your baby an over-the-counter electrolyte solution (hold off on cow's-milk formula). For ongoing baby diarrhea from antibiotics, some doctors recommend a probiotic supplement.<strong>What to feed:</strong> When appetite returns, offer babies eating solids a binding BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast), yogurt that contains live cultures (such as Stonyfield Farms), and low-fat protein, like baked chicken."

Who knew? The one your doc chooses could make your baby seem too big or too small. Fear not—Jennifer Trachtenberg, M.D., pediatrician and author of <em>The Smart Parent's Guide</em>, sorts it out:<strong><em>Q:</em> Why two growth charts?</strong><strong>A:</strong> The CDC chart is based on American babies, most of whom are formula-fed. The current WHO chart represents breastfed babies in six different countries as of 2006. Docs previously used the CDC chart, but now the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using the WHO one for kids under 2 years old.<strong><em>Q:</em> So why the change?</strong><strong>A:</strong> We now know that breastfed babies grow faster in the first three months and then slower through age 1. So on the CDC chart, breastfed babies suddenly fell off the normal curve. Doctors would see this drop and suggest supplementing, but that was a faulty conclusion.<strong><em>Q:</em> What are pediatricians looking for in these charts?</strong><strong>A:</strong> Your baby doesn't need to be in the 50th percentile across the board.

What causes it -- and how can we keep him <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">healthy</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>?<br><br>A. </br></br></strong>Anemia means your baby's number of red blood cells -- which carry oxygen to muscles and vital organs -- is lower than normal. The most common cause of it in babies is an iron-deficient diet. Without enough iron (which helps produce hemoglobin, a protein in these cells), the blood gets ""tired"" and, consequently, so does your baby's body.Iron-deficient anemia may also contribute to cognitive delays, since iron helps the trillions of nerve cells in a baby's rapidly growing brain make the right connections. Anemic babies often have suppressed immune systems as well, which is why they tend to get more colds.Anemia is common between 6 and 9 months, when the extra iron your baby stored up in the womb begins to be used up and must be replaced. While breast milk contains the highest-quality iron of any food, there isn't enough of it in mother's milk, so you may need to ask your doctor about supplementing with iron drops. Bottle-feeders should always use an iron-fortified formula. Cow's milk is low in iron, so the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends waiting until a baby is at least a year old to introduce it into his diet. You can, however, feed him iron-rich foods. The best ones for babies over 6 months: pureed beef, lamb, dark-meat poultry, and iron-fortified cereals."
 The Scoop On Restless Legs Syndrome,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-scoop-on-restless-legs-syndrome,"The first <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">symptom</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> describes many kids: trouble <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/child/sleep"">falling and staying asleep</a>. But if your child also complains of heavy-feeling legs, and has an uncontrollable urge to move them frequently during the night, he might have a condition called restless legs syndrome (RLS).As with growing pains, which can wake kids up at night with aches in their legs (often after they've played and run a lot), RLS can wake him up with discomfort, too. But it can also make it hard for a child to settle down at night in the first place. It may take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to fall asleep. And then he'll wake up repeatedly through the night with a need to move his legs.If you suspect RLS, ask your doctor to test your child's iron levels—about three-quarters of patients are deficient in the mineral. If your child is, he may need iron supplements. There's also anecdotal evidence that evening exercise may help. Running, skipping, jumping—that's a treatment a kid'll love! "

(If your kids are anything like mine, they'll probably play with the cheap toys more than the ones you spent the mortgage on anyway!) What's more important, though, is that your kids understand that Christmas is also about the joy and love on such a special day. After my kids inspect their gifts, we make breakfast together and, holiday music blasting, eat as a family, reminding ourselves how blessed we are to have each other in our lives. That's a gift that's much too precious for Santa to carry around in his bag. Tell your children this, remind yourself, too, and let the magic be. "

Food allergies are quite common in little ones: One out of every 17 children age 3 and under suffers from them. So what can you do? Start with these facts, tips and suggestions.Beware of the most common allergens: cow's milk, egg whites, wheat, peanuts and tree nuts (walnuts, almonds, pecans, cashews), fish and shellfish, and soy.Food allergies can be hereditary, hence babies whose parents have allergies are at higher risk for developing them. The good news: Most children outgrow them by 5 years of age.Some studies have shown that breastfeeding may help protect your baby from developing certain food allergies, particularly if you have a family history of them. If you're not breastfeeding or need to supplement, ask your pediatrician to recommend a formula.Look for any of the symptoms of an allergic reaction. They include but are not limited to hives, rashes, throat tightness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pale skin and lightheadedness.

Skip fluoridated paste for now; swallowing too much fluoride can discolor permanent teeth. Use plain water or a fluoride-free toothpaste, such as Orajel Toddler Training Toothpaste. If your water isn't fluoridated, ask your dentist about a supplement.Continue to use water or fluoride-free paste until your child can spit into the sink. Then you can use a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste. Around age 4, when back molars are touching, start to floss. Wrap it in a ""C"" shape around each tooth and glide it gently.Let your child brush by herself with a soft brush, but follow up. Teach by letting her mimic you. An electric brush, such as the Crest SpinBrush, can help kids brush more easily and give them more gum stimulation. Whether she's using a manual or electric brush, she'll be ready to brush solo about the time she can tie her shoes."

 Pump Up The Iron,http://www.parenting.com/article/pump-up-the-iron,"Nine percent of children between 12 and 36 months, however, are iron-deficient, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If your baby isn't getting enough iron (pediatricians order a routine blood test between 9 and 12 months), don't panic and start force-feeding iron-rich foods, says Susan Moores, M.S., R.D., spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. This isn't necessary and, at high levels, can even be toxic. Simply choosing different foods should do the trick.<b>How much is enough?</b>Babies only need 6 to 10 milligrams of iron daily. That's equal to three servings of iron-fortified cereal a day or a jar of baby food with meat and vegetables. In addition, offering foods high in vitamin C  -- such as fortified apple juice or a jar of mashed bananas  -- will improve the absorption of iron found in fruits, vegetables, breads, and cereals. Some other good choices for introducing a little more iron:"
 Formula Firsts,http://www.parenting.com/article/formula-firsts,"<strong>A.</strong> First, I want to congratulate you for giving breastfeeding a try, and I'm happy to hear that your baby is thriving. While breast milk is preferred infant nutrition, formula manufacturers make every attempt to match the composition of their products as closely as possible to human milk. Over the past few years, attention has been focused on two key ingredients found in human milk  -- the fatty acids DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and ARA (arachidonic acid), which are essential building blocks of brain and eye tissue.Babies get these fatty acids in the womb, from breast milk, and later, from solid foods. They are also made in the body from nutrients found in breast milk and formula, though recent studies have shown that breastfed infants have higher blood concentrations of DHA and ARA than formula-fed infants. Last year U.S. manufacturers began marketing infant formulas that contain DHA and ARA; similar products have been used safely for years in other countries. However, while studies have shown that premature babies benefit from formula supplemented with DHA and ARA, it's not yet clear if full-term infants do.The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated that there is not enough evidence thus far to issue a recommendation on the topic. Since the jury is still out about the benefits of these formulas for full-term babies, right now, it's a personal choice. So talk to your pediatrician to decide what's right for you and your baby."

 Ask Dr. Sears: On a Nursing Strike,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-on-a-nursing-strike,"<strong>Q.</strong> <strong>My 10-month-old daughter has been refusing to nurse lately. She started eating solids about six weeks ago. I don't give her anything supplemental to drink, hoping she will begin nursing again, but it doesn't seem to be working. She is quite happy to sit in my lap and drink a bottle of my breast milk, but won't nurse from the breast. It concerns me that she's not getting enough to drink, but I don't want to pump my milk every time she is thirsty. She has a great appetite for <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">food</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> and will cry until we put her in her high chair to eat  -- which kills the ""nurse before I feed her"" idea. What can I do?</strong><strong>A.</strong> In breastfeeding circles, this annoying quirk is dubbed a ""nursing strike."" It's especially frustrating for nursing mothers who are not yet ready to wean their baby and who believe baby isn't ready to wean either. Nursing strikes are most common following some upset in routine, such as a family trip, a move, a parent changing jobs, or a prolonged separation from one or both parents. But many times it's difficult to pinpoint the reason for the strike. Here are some ways to woo your baby back to breastfeeding:<br><br><strong>Replay her favorite nursing situations.</strong> To entice your little ""striker"" back to the breast, try to relive her favorite nursing situations, such as nursing in a beloved rocking chair. Sit down in the rocking chair and hold her in the nursing position next to your breast while you thumb through a picture book. This scene may trigger fond memories of nursing and rocking and may encourage her to nurse. When one of our babies went on a nursing strike, what worked was nursing her in the bathtub. My daughter loved taking a bath with my wife and enjoyed nursing while half-immersed in warm water. Hopefully, revisiting a scene such as this will prompt your baby to resume nursing.<br><br><strong>Nap nurse.</strong> This is usually the best way to woo a baby back to the breast, especially if she was previously accustomed to nursing while lying down in your bed. Pick a time of the day when you are most tired and your baby is most hungry.<br><br><strong>Minimize distractions.</strong> At 10 months of age, babies can become easily distracted while nursing, especially if there is a lot of commotion in the room. Try what is dubbed ""closet nursing."" Pick a couple times of the day when she is most hungry. Go into a dark, quiet room, sit in a comfortable chair, sing her favorite lullaby, and let her nurse.<br><br><strong>Slow down on other feedings.</strong> Continue to try to nurse her before you feed her other foods. Decrease the volume of solid foods and even supplemental bottles. You want to replant the idea in her mind (and her tummy) that food comes primarily from nursing, and secondarily from the plate and the bottles. <br><br>At 10 months of age it's unlikely that your baby is truly ready to wean, although it is possible. Try not to get so frustrated or impatient that your baby feels she is being forced to nurse. Go gradually with the above tips, and most likely, your nursing striker will return to extended breastfeeding within a week or two.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>"
 Combining Breast and Bottle Feeding,http://www.parenting.com/article/combining-breast-and-bottle-feeding,"It was an easy two-hour drive to Scranton, PA, with her 10-week-old son, Connor, snoozing in his car seat, and the actress and writer Amy Wilson was ready for her performance in <em>The Vagina Monologues</em>, the hilarious play about--well, you know what it's about. It would be her first time working since before Connor's arrival, but her parents lived in the area, so her mom was on call for babysitting.Despite some reflux, Connor had been a champion nurser. Wilson had yet to get him to drink any breast milk out of a bottle, however. ""I was sure that once he was hungry enough, he'd eat. Of course he would,"" says Wilson.He didn't. Eight hours later, Wilson returned to find her mother holding a wide-eyed Connor, who had refused to drink even an ounce of milk from the bottle--he'd gone purple with anger at the sight of it. ""I had listened to all the experts the first time around who warned of 'nipple confusion' if even one bottle was introduced too early,"" recalls Wilson. ""But I'd waited too long, and he never wanted any part of it. If I had to leave him for a funeral or a meeting or a haircut, he'd simply not eat until the moment I returned.""By now, you've surely heard that ""breast is best."" Breastfeeding is the ideal way to feed your child for the first year of life: It provides optimal nutrition and is a fantastic way to bond. It may reduce rates of childhood obesity, diabetes, and ear infections, among other health benefits.The only downside to nursing is that it may be hard: It can be physically exhausting and challenging to learn how to do it. ""The fact is, breastfeeding is easier for some women,"" says Marianne Neifert, M.D., author of <em>Great Expectations: The Essential Guide to Breastfeeding</em>. ""Some women put in a lot of effort and they might not produce as much milk as someone who puts in less effort."" Add to this the fact that new moms don't get a ton of breastfeeding instruction during their short stay at the hospital, employers aren't always supportive of pumping, and much of America gets icked-out when a mom nurses at the mall. But before you throw in the towel, realize there's no one right way to feed a baby. You don't have to breastfeed exclusively--you can combine it with bottle-feeding in a routine that works for both of you.If doing a combo of the two means that you're happier and saner, then you should do it--without worrying about what anyone else thinks. ""Maybe more women would make it to a year of breastfeeding if they could go see a movie every once in a while,"" says Wilson, who recently wrote <em>When Did I Get Like This? The Screamer, The Worrier, The Dinosaur-Chicken-Nugget Buyer and Other Mothers I Swore I'd Never Be</em>. Here's how to make the most of both feeding methods so you can get some rest, go to work, and maybe even get out to see that movie.<strong>Gear Up</strong>Your little sucker might have a preference when it comes to bottles, so you may need to try a few different types before you hit on the ones he likes best. Just be sure the ones you try are free of BPA, a potential toxin.If you're hoping to pump breast milk on a regular basis (you're going back to work, for example), you'll want a double electric breast pump. While they can be pricey (they average about $300), you'll soon save that much in formula expenses. If you're going to supplement with formula and won't be expressing much, a less-expensive manual pump will do the job.Not sure how you'll feel about pumping? Try it out by renting a hospital-grade electric pump for about $75 a month. Ask at your hospital or find locations near you at <a href=""http://medelabreastfeedingus.com/"">Medelabreastfeedingus.com</a>. Another great tool to have is a super-convenient hands-free bra/bustier, which means that you can e-mail, eat lunch, or entertain your toddler--all while pumping! (Sounds strange, but trust us--it makes a huge quality-of-life difference.) Or you can get the same effect by cutting two vertical openings in a sports bra to hold your pumping cups in place.<strong>Get Ready</strong>The idea of ""nipple confusion"" (the notion that once a baby is fed from a bottle, he'll never accept the breast again) has been largely debunked. The general guideline is that you want to wait until your milk supply is established, usually around two to three weeks after birth, and your baby is feeding well before introducing a bottle. But there aren't any hard-and-fast rules. Some moms successfully introduce a bottle almost as soon as they come home from the hospital.However, it's also possible to wait too long, says Susan Burger, a lactation consultant in New York City. Since babies start to get more socially aware around 6 weeks and become more specific about their preferences, some will balk at or even refuse the bottle if it's introduced much after this age.A good time to introduce those first few bottles is during the second feeding of the day, when your baby is hungry but not starving, and likely to be in a good mood. It can also help to have your partner or Grandma feed your baby the first bottle, so that your boobs aren't there to tempt him.<strong>Pump Like a Pro: </strong>To maintain your milk supply at your current level, just turn to your pump whenever you would normally nurse your baby. If you want to stock up on extra milk, add in a pumping session. In fact, you may want to start doing this a few weeks before you return to work, so you have a nice starting supply. You'll have the most milk in the morning, so if you pump right after your morning feeding session, you can save that milk for later.<strong>Supplementing Secrets:</strong>If it's not realistic to pump at work or you can't do it as often as you need to, supplement with formula. Most babies will do fine on a regular cow's-milk formula, but ask your pediatrician what she recommends for your baby. Start by replacing just one feeding session with formula, and drop that nursing session. If you feel like your breasts are going to explode, you can pump a little bit to relieve the pressure and make it to your next feeding. (If you completely empty your breasts, that will just send a message to your boobs to produce more milk.) The ideal is to drop one nursing session a week; otherwise, you'll be at increased risk for clogged milk ducts and mastitis. Some women, however, find that they can get away with dropping a feeding every four or five days (you may want to write it all down to keep track, especially if you're still sleep-deprived!).When her second son, Seamus, was born 18 months after Connor, Wilson introduced the bottle early and often, and he switched easily between the two. ""So many women give up on breastfeeding after just a couple of weeks because it's hard and because it seems like it's all or nothing. No one tells you that it gets easier, that your partner can be on duty without your baby being warped, and that you just may come to love nursing,"" says Wilson. ""I think if there were less judgment, more support, and more open conversation about 'doing the combo' of nursing and bottle-feeding, many women would breastfeed longer. And that's a win-win for everyone."""

""Breastfeeding protects your baby from illness and infection, enhances brain development, and lowers the risk of developing asthma and diabetes,"" says Marianne Neifert, M.D., a Denver pediatrician and the author of Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding. Moms benefit too: Nursing lowers your risk of breast cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and possibly osteoporosis. It also burns calories (about 500 a day), can be convenient (no bottles to wash or formula to mix), and is cheap (you only need a few nursing bras and, usually, a breast pump). If you pump breast milk, someone else can feed it to your baby by bottle. <span class='""blue10b""'>Drawbacks:</span> It's all you, all the time: Nursing is time-consuming (a newborn can feed every two or three hours all day and night), and you need to pump even if Dad gives the baby a bottle of breast milk. ""Nursing can cause great fatigue,"" says Will Wilkoff, M.D., a pediatrician in Brunswick, Maine, and author of <em>The Maternity Leave Breastfeeding Plan</em>. ""In fact, it's a bigger energy drain on your body than pregnancy."" Nursing can make some women self-conscious, and the learning curve can be steep. Sore nipples, plugged milk ducts, mastitis (a breast inflammation), and engorgement can be painful side effects. Scheduling can be a challenge, especially for working moms -- some jobs may not allow for multiple pumping breaks. <span class='""blue10b""'>How I decided:</span> ""I breastfed my baby because it was the easiest method for me. When my son woke up at night, the milk was set to go -- it was already mixed and warmed."" <em>-- Misty Zerkel, Lyons, OR</em> ""I worried that breastfeeding would be embarrassing and that my husband might get grossed out. But even after soreness and mastitis, it still was the best choice -- and my husband is more amazed by my body than ever!"" <em>-- Zoe Albright, Lee's Summit, MO</em><strong>Bottle</strong><span class='""blue10b""'> Benefits:</span> Feeding with a bottle can be very comforting: You see just how much is going into your baby and can be satisfied knowing the feedings have been complete. Bottle-feeding can provide an emotional closeness and nurturing similar to breastfeeding. ""There's a quicker start to bottle-feeding -- you just pop it in the baby's mouth and you're off,"" says Dr. Wilkoff. You can also share the feedings with Dad or a sitter while you're freed up to work, care for other kids, or rest. <span class='""blue10b""'>Drawbacks:</span> ""In a word -- constipation. You just don't see this in breastfed babies, but it's pretty common in formula-fed ones,"" says Dr. Wilkoff. Babies can also develop an intolerance to formula, so several switches may have to be made to find the most suitable version for them to drink. Overfeeding is a possibility, especially if moms encourage their tot to finish the prepared bottle even when the baby is satisfied. Formula is costly, though it varies by brand and preparation (ready-to-go liquid or powdered, individual servings or bulk packages). Bottles and nipples need to be purchased, initially sterilized, and washed after that. Feedings have to be prepared, stored, and then packed for most outings with your baby. <span class='""blue10b""'>How I decided:</span> ""Bottle-feeding allowed my three step-kids to help feed their new baby sister, which they were so excited to do."" <em>-- Kimberly Carney, Drexel Hill, PA</em> ""I was getting terrible migraine headaches, so in order to take prescription medications, I put my daughter on formula. I think that the bottle-feeding has helped her and my husband develop a strong bond."" <em>-- Kara Tobaben, Fairfax, VA</em><span class=""c1""> </span><strong>Both</strong> <span class='""blue10b""'>Benefits:</span> Supplementing breastfeeding with bottles can be the best of both worlds: You're giving your baby the nutritional benefits of breast milk while giving yourself some flexibility and a chance to rest. Adding formula bottles to a nursing routine can be ideal for working moms -- no pump or on-the-job breaks needed. It's also a relief for those with low milk supply or latch-on difficulties, or who are exhausted or frustrated by nursing. Giving your baby expressed breast milk is even better. If pumping works well for you, your supply can usually be maintained while you're at work and nursing can continue when you're at home. <span class='""blue10b""'>Drawbacks:</span> Fully breastfed babies are the most protected from illness. ""The immune benefits from breast milk work best if it's the only food being given,"" says Dr. Neifert. And while most babies can easily switch between breast and bottle, some may refuse. Or your baby may prefer the faster flow of a bottle and nurse less frequently, which means your milk production will decrease. ""Cutting back on nursing is not always a linear process, so that breastfeeding only half the time may produce less than half the milk,"" explains Dr. Wilkoff. If you decide to do the combo with formula, wait until after the first few weeks so you can build up your milk supply. To avoid clogged ducts as you add bottles, wait four to seven days before dropping a nursing session. <span class='""blue10b""'>How I decided:</span> ""I like to breastfeed at home, but when I go out I either pump milk for her or have a bottle of formula ready. It's been very convenient."" <em>-- Eliana Munoz, Astoria, NY</em> ""My son was in the NICU for a week, so I wasn't able to be there all the time or pump enough milk. At home I nursed most of the time, but since my production was still low, I supplemented with bottles of formula."" <em>-- Jamie Wanis, Gaithersburg, MD</em><strong> The Breastfeeding Mom's Bill of Rights</strong> As if engorged breasts weren't enough of a pain, breastfeeders have to face bossy strangers and cruel coworkers. Here, a review of your rights. <strong>1. If you have a right to be somewhere with your baby, you have a right to breastfeed there.</strong> It's the law, says La Leche League International. While there are a few places, such as courtrooms, where babies aren't permitted, women can legally breastfeed in most public places -- stores, restaurants, parks, and malls. This holds true even if your state doesn't have legislation protecting a woman's right to breastfeed in public. (Almost half of all states do; visit LaLeche League to see if yours does.) <strong>2. You have a right to ask for pumping accommodations at work.</strong> American employers aren't required to provide moms with a place to pump, but several states mandate that employers enable women to breastfeed. And most require that workers be given break time and a space to pump that isn't a bathroom stall. The Breastfeeding Promotion Act includes a provision to offer tax incentives for businesses that provide private lactation areas. The key to successful pumping at work is clear communication with supervisors, say experts. Ask for a room with a lockable door, a place to sit, and an electrical outlet for the pump. <strong>3. You have a right to breastfeed for as long as you see fit.</strong> While nursing into toddlerhood is common elsewhere, Americans often view it as odd or even perverse. Critics may be surprised to learn that the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends nursing ""for as long as mutually desired."" That can mean up to age 3 or 4, says Lawrence Gartner, M.D., executive committee chair of the AAP's Section on Breastfeeding. In addition to health benefits, he says, nursing provides a strong bond between mother and child. <em>-- Katherine Kam</em><strong> The Bottle-feeding Mom's Bill of Rights</strong> <span class=""c1"">Only a mom can know what's best for her baby -- and for herself. So, instead of letting someone else guilt-trip you, know your rights.</span> <strong>1. You have a right to bottle-feed without guilt or lengthy excuses.</strong> Sure, some moms aren't able to breastfeed for health reasons. ""There are women determined to breastfeed who just aren't able to produce enough milk,"" explains Phillip Stubblefield, M.D., a professor of ob-gyn at the Boston University School of Medicine. But whether it's health-related, because of painful side effects, or for another reason entirely, don't feel that you have to explain yourself to avoid being publicly ostracized. ""Women have the right to decide what's best for themselves and for their baby,"" says Diane Sanford, Ph.D., who specializes in women's health. If you feel good about yourself and your choices, those positive feelings will get passed on to your infant. <strong>2. You have a right to supplement nursing with formula or breast milk.</strong> Don't feel like you have to choose one method or the other. Many women prefer a combination of breast and bottle. (Be aware that if you choose to supplement with formula, you'll have a decreased milk supply if you don't pump regularly.) <strong>3. You have a right to bottle-feed without trying to breastfeed first.</strong> ""Trust your instincts,"" says Sanford. ""There's not a lot of encouraging literature out there about bottle-feeding. The worst situation is if a mom wants to bottle-feed but is persuaded by others to breastfeed."" While breastfeeding may be ideal, there's nothing wrong with using formula, says Mel Heyman, M.D., a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition and a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. What's most important to your baby's development is love, affection, and a close emotional bond. Says Sanford: ""Whether it's breast or bottle, you can still provide these things to a baby."" <em>-- Emily Hebert</em>"
 Ask Dr. Sears: Nursing Caries,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-nursing-carries,"How to take <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">care</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> of your baby's teeth when he's bottle or breastfeeding<span class=""green10""><strong>Q: My son was diagnosed at thirteen months with nursing caries. I have cut down his nighttime feedings to one or two. I have also been wiping and brushing his teeth, day and night. My question is, what else should I do? My son is not ready to be weaned and neither am I, but I want to protect his teeth.</strong></span>A: It's good that your child's dentist detected this problem early, and you are wise to seek remedies to prevent further tooth decay. Erosion of the teeth enamel is much more common with nighttime bottlefeeding, but it does also occasionally occur in breastfed babies. When babies fall asleep, saliva secretion decreases, so they lose the natural rinsing action of saliva that they have during daytime feeding. The sugars in the milk bathe the teeth during the night and eventually can cause tooth decay. Nursing caries are more prevalent in babies who enjoy frequent nighttime feedings. I dub them, ""all night suckers."" Try these tips to continue letting your baby enjoy the health and developmental benefits of breastfeeding, yet protect his precious teeth from decay.<strong>Lessen night feedings.</strong> It's common for toddlers to increase their number of night nursings. They get so busy during the day and forget to nurse, so they make up for it at night. Purposely increase the number of daytime feedings by nap nursing -- choose a couple times during the day when you are the most tired, and lie down and nurse your baby. Toddlers also get distracted easily during daytime nursing. So, take your baby in a dark, quiet room and get down to the business of nursing. Ease him into a feeding pattern that helps him learn that daytime is for feeding and nighttime is for sleeping.<strong>Tank up baby with a before-bed feeding.</strong> Make the last feeding of the day a big one. Give your baby a feeding of solid food later in the evening. Mashed avocado is a filling food for babies because it is high in healthy fats and fiber. Besides nursing your baby to sleep, consider awakening your baby just before you go to bed for another tank-up feeding.<strong>Brush his teeth frequently.</strong> The two most important times to cleanse those pearly whites is right after the first feeding in the morning and after the last feeding at night. Try a soft-bristle brush or wrap gauze around your index finger and use it as a toothbrush. Nursing carries are most prominent in the front teeth, especially along the gum lines. Be sure to curve your finger, or the brush, enough to cleanse behind the teeth. It often takes two people to brush a baby's teeth, so you and Dad sit facing one another knees to knees and stretch baby across your laps, with his head on your lap. Then you can brush his teeth from above, which helps you get better access to the teeth. Dad can hold the squirming baby while you brush the teeth. You can also give your toddler his own toothbrush and capitalize on his natural desire to mimic. While you are brushing your teeth, encourage him to do likewise.<strong>Consider a fluoride supplement.</strong> Since babies usually don't drink enough water, especially if you drink unfluoridated bottled water, ask your dentist for the appropriate dosage of a fluoride supplement for your baby. This could be in the form of daily fluoride drops or you could use no more than a pea-sized dab of fluoridated toothpaste. Concerning fluoride, be sure not to give more than your dentist prescribes, since too much fluoride can weaken the enamel instead of strengthen it.<strong>Avoid sticky stuff.</strong> Because of the choking hazard, baby is too young to suck on hard candy anyway, but with toddlers, avoid caramel and sweets that stick to the teeth.<strong>Substitute night ""nursings.""</strong> The term ""nursing"" does not mean only breastfeeding; it implies any method of comforting. A father can ""nurse,"" too. If your baby needs a middle-of-the-night sucking to soothe him back to sleep, let him suck on your finger or knuckle. Sometimes a lullaby will do just that -- lull a baby back to sleep. For babies who want a nighttime bottle, try the trick I call ""watering down"" -- each night gradually dilute the formula with increasing amounts of water until your baby's bottle is 100 percent water. "
 Is Fish Okay for Babies?,http://www.parenting.com/article/should-babies-eat-fish,"The nutritional benefits of Omega 3 <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">foods</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> like salmon, tuna and other fish to infants.As a pediatrician and father of eight, I've realized how much children's health and behavior is affected, for better or worse, by what they eat. Of course, you already know how important a balanced diet full of whole grains, vegetables, fruit and lean proteins is, but when it comes to babies and toddlers, one thing I always found missing from their diet was fish. Parents didn't seem to think it was a ""baby"" food.But over the years, I'd been reading more and more about the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, essential nutrients found in seafood. Study after study was proving their contribution to infant brain development and more. I began ""prescribing"" omega-3's to my patients in 2000 by encouraging their parents to offer them more fish. Since then, I've only grown more convinced that omega-3's are the head-to-toe nutrient because they're good for nearly every organ of a child's body, from the brain to the skin. Most parents, however, are unsure about feeding their babies fish, which is the richest source of DHA, the healthiest type of omega-3 fatty acid for infants. Here's why—and how—to ""go fish,"" for both your baby and you!What eating fish can do for you and your baby:In the '80s and early '90s, initial research suggested that infants who received DHA-enriched formula experienced improved cognitive development, leading the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in 2001, to allow infant formula to be supplemented with the brain-building omega-3, DHA. Since then, the proof keeps piling up. A 2003 study in the journal Pediatrics found that mothers who took omega-3 supplements during pregnancy and lactation increased their children's cognitive abilities at 4 years of age. In 2005, another study revealed that schoolchildren who were given omega-3 supplements showed improved reading and spelling scores. Since a child's brain grows fastest prenatally and continues to grow rapidly in the first year of life, tripling in size by the end of the first year, this is an ideal time to get DHA into his diet.Another study found that toddlers whose mothers had higher DHA blood levels at delivery were better able to maintain focus on an object compared with tots whose mothers had lower DHA levels.DHA has been shown to help sharpen vision in infants.Research has shown that adults who consume more omega-3's have a lower rate of mood disorders and that women who eat fish high in these fatty acids during pregnancy suffer less postpartum depression. Why? Omega-3's may act in the brain to raise levels of ""happy"" hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, the neurotransmitters in the brain that are also targeted by some prescription antidepressants. I'll eat to that!These fantastic fatty acids have also been linked to improved immunity. In one study, Danish toddlers who consumed formula supplemented with fish oil had much higher levels of a protein that's key to healthy immune function than those who drank plain formula or cow's milk.Omega-3's can decrease inflammation in all parts of the body, including the skin. Serving a little salmon or chunk-light tuna to your baby before 9 months may actually help to protect him from devel­oping the allergic skin condition, according to a Swedish study.Answers to the most common questions parents ask me:Except for shellfish, you can serve your baby puréed or mashed fish as early as 6 months when he starts eating solids. Fish may seem like a ""grown-up"" food, but it is the ideal fare for infants. Read on for serving ideas.Oily fish such as chunk-light tuna, sardines, halibut and salmon are the best sources of healthy omega-3's. But sardines aren't practical for feeding to a baby, and halibut and tuna are higher in mercury. That makes salmon the best source of DHA (again, the star omega-3 fatty acid) and, in my opinion, the healthiest fish for kids and adults alike. But almost all seafood contains omega-3's, so try giving your baby a variety of low-mercury fish. Pollock is used in most commercial fish sticks and is another good choice.Some fish are high in mercury and other pollutants. Check out the ""Mercury Meter,"" a guide to mercury levels in commonly consumed fish, from the Natural Resources Defense Council. Try to stick to the fish in the ""low mercury"" category, though infants can eat up to three ounces per week of the fish listed as ""moderate mercury"" (adults can eat up to six ounces). Avoid those fish in the ""high"" category altogether. Finally, shellfish can be allergenic; your doctor may recommend holding off until age 2.Omega-3's are the standout nutrient, but fish is also a wonderful source of lean protein. It's high in vitamin D, too, an important vitamin for strong bones that many children are lacking, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.I recommend that infants get around 300 milligrams of DHA per day, more than half of which they can get from their regular daily feedings of breast milk or formula fortified with DHA. On top of that, try to give your solids-eating tot a total of about two ounces of wild salmon per week. Once your baby is off formula and/or breast milk, try to up her amount of wild salmon to six or seven ounces per week. If you find it difficult to reach that amount, consider a supplement to make up the difference. Ask your doctor for a recommendation, or try my own DHA liquid called Go Fish (find retailers at <a class=""vglnk"" href=""http://Drsearshealthykids.com"" rel=""nofollow""><span>Drsearshealthykids</span><span>.</span><span>com</span></a>).You want to be careful that you're not consuming too much mercury but also getting a healthy amount of DHA. Stick to the recommendations already given in terms of how much fish you eat and, in addition, make sure your prenatal vitamin contains DHA (most do). Try to get at least 300 milligrams per day. For reference, the amount of DHA and other omega-3's in six ounces of wild Alaskan salmon is around 2,000 milligrams.Doubtful your baby will eat fish? Start with salmon, and try these tips:Pop open a can of boneless wild salmon, and dole out bites to your baby (no need to cook it!). Blend the salmon flakes into mac 'n' cheese or mashed potatoes. Another option: HappyBaby sells a frozen puree of wild salmon, lentils and sweet potatoes (find retailers at <a href=""http://www.happybabyfood.com/"" target=""_blank"">Happybabyfood.com</a>).Puree cooked salmon (canned or fresh) with lemon, olive oil and seasonings then spread it on bread or crackers.My daughter, Hayden, makes delicious breaded salmon strips that her son loves. Just as you would with chicken fingers, dip inch-wide strips of salmon fillet into beaten eggs and coat them with a mixture of whole-wheat flour, whole-wheat bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and a dash of salt. Then bake the strips for about eight minutes. However you prepare it, offer fish to your baby from the start, and it will be a favorite food.Learn more about <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/dha-a-smart-supplement"">DHA for kids</a>"

 Will You Still Be Fertile in 5 Years?,http://www.parenting.com/article/will-you-still-be-fertile-in-5-years21336226,"Looking at these pregnancy factors can help when the biological clock seems to be ticking.Thinking of having another child? You may have less time than you imagine to conceive without difficulty. Still, you may be able to take steps now to improve your chances.To help judge the <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/fertility/infertility/when-right-time-to-see-fertility-doctor"">state of your fertility</a>, consider these questions:Age is by far the biggest factor in fertility, and even the most advanced infertility treatments aren't always able to turn back the clock. ""Women are postponing childbearing until later in life — that's the very reason we see more problems today,"" says Pamela Madsen, executive director of the American Infertility Association.Some researchers believe that fertility peaks as early as a woman's late 20s, and there's a consensus that by her early 30s, both the quantity and the quality of her eggs have begun to decline.It's a gradual process, so there's certainly no need to panic. But if you're 30, you may not want to wait ten years to start trying to get pregnant again. At age 35 about three-quarters of women will be able to conceive without treatment, but by age 40 only half will, says Owen Davis, M.D., director of the IVF Program at Cornell Medical Center in New York City. By age 45 it's under 10 percent.The risk of miscarriage also goes up with age. At 35, about one in five pregnancies doesn't result in a live birth; by age 42 more than half fail, according to a study of over 500,000 women million women in Denmark. An older egg becomes an embryo that's more prone to genetic damage, researchers believe.Infertility is traditionally defined as the inability to conceive after one year of unprotected sex. ""In my opinion, a woman under thirty-five should try to conceive for that amount of time before she seeks medical help to find out why she's not getting pregnant,"" says Magdy Milad, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist and an associate professor of obstetrics/gynecology at Northwestern University Medical School, in Chicago. ""Between the ages of 35 and 39, she should try for six months. And after the age of 40, she should try for three months and then see a doctor for an evaluation, just to make sure that nothing's wrong and she doesn't run out of time to try treatment.""If so, you're hurting your chances of getting pregnant at any age. Exposing your eggs to nicotine will not only affect the quality of your eggs but decrease your ovaries' supply. The more cigarettes a woman smokes daily, the lower her chances of conceiving. Smoking can also speed up the age at which menopause begins, prematurely closing your lifetime window of fertility.The good news is that quitting now can restore much of your fertility. It's not immediate, though. ""Once a woman quits, it can take several months for smoking-related toxins to be cleared from the body,"" says Dr. Milad.Passive smoking interferes too: In one study, women exposed to smoke at work or at home were less likely to conceive within a year than peers who were exposed to little or none.Being seriously over- or underweight - for a woman who's 5 foot 4, for instance, being heavier than 175 pounds (a body mass index of 30) or lighter than 105 pounds (a body mass index of 18) — may have a bearing on fertility, but only if it affects ovulation.If your periods are normal, your weight is unlikely to impact your ability to get pregnant, says Bryan Cowan, M.D., chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the <a href=""http://www.umc.edu/"">University of Mississippi Medical Center</a>, in Jackson. But if you're overweight and your periods are irregular, talk to your doctor. On the other hand, if you're very thin or have recently lost a lot of weight and your periods have become irregular or have stopped, gaining weight may be the first step toward fertility.Thousands of prescription and over-the-counter medications — as well as herbal remedies — can have an effect on fertility. But the main concern is a class of drugs that affect your body's production of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) — key players in your ovulatory cycle. These include steroids (for asthma and rheumatoid arthritis), as well as prescription medicines that contain metoclopramide (for gastrointestinal upset) or phenothiazines (for anxiety.) It's always a good idea to talk with your doctor about which medications you are taking — or have taken — that might have an impact on fertility.Contraceptives may also have an effect. If you've been on the Pill for a long time, it may take two to five months for your body to start ovulating normally once you go off it; that's also true for the newer hormone-based contraceptives like the Mirena IUD or the Nuva ring. ""It's a myth that taking the Pill will prevent you from getting pregnant in the future,"" says Helane Rosenberg, Ph.D., egg donor coordinator at <a href=""http://www.ivfnj.com/"">IVF New Jersey</a>, in Somerset ""But if you've been taking it for a long time, it could be masking a problem that would make you ovulate irregularly if you weren't taking the contraceptive.""The exception is if you've been treated with Depo Provera - in that case, the wait could be much longer. ""Since the drug is injected into muscle, the hormone absorption may be so slow that it could take as long as a year for your fertility to return to normal,"" says William Gibbons, M.D., chairman of the department of obstetrics/gynecology at <a href=""https://www.evms.edu/"">Eastern Virginia Medical School</a>, in Norfolk. Norplant, though, has no adverse effect on fertility once it's removed.If you're using herbal remedies, be wary: They're not regulated, so there's no requirement that their effects on conception and pregnancy be properly researched. Some reports have suggested that popular supplements — Saint-John's-wort, ginkgo, Echinacea — may negatively affect fertility, but other studies have found no effect, so there's no way to tell yet. ""If you're having trouble conceiving and you're taking herbal supplements, you might want to stop, just in case,"" says registered dietitian Paul Thomas, editor of <em>The Dietary Supplement,</em> a newsletter for health professionals and consumers. If it was caught early and treated, an STD will probably not affect your ability to get pregnant. But one that was untreated for a long period of time may cause problems; untreated chlamydia, for instance, can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which may make you infertile. Chlamydia and gonorrhea can also cause scarring of the fallopian tubes or low-grade infections that can change how receptive your uterine lining is, says Carolyn Salafia, M.D., director of EarlyPath Diagnostics, a research facility in Larchmont, NY.That's why it's important to be checked for STDs by your doctor before you try to get pregnant. Your partner should get checked too: STDS can also block production of sperm.Even if you've had a c-section, you won't necessarily find it harder to conceive your next child, unless there was tissue scarring, which can potentially impair fertility. (Nor do the vast majority of abortions affect conception.)On the other hand, even a problem-free pregnancy doesn't mean it'll be easy to get pregnant the next time. ""If your first pregnancy was uneventful, it excludes certain problems in the future, such as specific congenital abnormalities, but it's not a guarantee — other factors, like age, can affect your chances,"" says Dr. Davis.If you have an irregular cycle that is very long (more than 36 days) or short (less than 22 days), it's possible that your ovaries aren't functioning normally, and that could have an impact on the viability of your eggs when you try to get pregnant. Every woman's cycle is different, but see your doctor to rule out possible medical causes, such as thyroid disease or polycystic ovarian syndrome; both can be detected by blood tests and treated. Fibroids, which can cause heavy periods, may also interfere with fertility and are also easily treated. Fortunately, if you are not ovulating normally when you want to conceive, there are a number of medications that can correct the problem.It isn't clear whether daily stress has an effect on one's chances of getting pregnant. Some experts think it may decrease the production of estrogen, but others find no link. It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg issue: Infertility itself is stressful, so it's not surprising that women who seek help may report feeling tense.Depression is another matter: ""A number of studies link depression and trouble conceiving,"" says Alice Domar, Ph.D., director of the Mind/Body Center for Women's Health at Boston IVF, Harvard Medical School, and coauthor of <em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Conquering-Infertility-Domars-Enhancing-Fertility/dp/0142002011"">Conquering Infertility</a>.</em> ""If you want to conceive in the future and you're having emotional problems, try to see a mental health professional,"" says Dr. Domar. But if you're sure that your emotional stress is related to pregnancy worries, you may want to join a fertility support group. It will not only give you a place to talk about your experiences but also teach you coping techniques for stress management and relaxation. To find a group in your area, visit, the website of the National Infertility Association, and click on Local Chapters.A well-balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables is always a good idea, but the average American diet provides the necessary vitamins and minerals for fertility, says Dr. Cowan. Of course, every woman of childbearing age should take a multivitamin with at least 400 micrograms of folic acid — it helps prevent neural tube defects only if you take it <em>before</em> you get pregnant.Caffeine remains controversial. Some studies indicate that it can delay conception, but others show — you guessed it — no effect. Once you do become pregnant, though, caffeine matters: As little as two cups a day can double your risk of miscarriage. Says Dr. Milad, ""I give my patients who are trying to get pregnant the same advice I give those who are pregnant - keep caffeine intake in check and take your vitamins.""So, will you be fertile in five years? There's no way to be absolutely sure, of course. The more you know, the easier it is to plan your future. And the healthier your lifestyle, the better your chances will be.<span class=""grey10"">If you're using a home pregnancy test, wait at least ten days after your period is due to try it. If you test too soon, the result may signal that you're not pregnant when you really are, says epidemiologist Donna Day Baird, Ph.D. ""The fertilized egg may not yet be implanted in the uterus by the time a woman expects her period,"" she says, ""so the test can't detect the pregnancy.""  – Rachelle Vander Schaaf</span>"

If you're like I <em>used</em> to be, you probably shook your head, give it a ""Yeah, right!"" and moved on.Recently, a 31-year-old nun in Italy was rushed to the hospital with stomach pains and delivered a healthy, full-term baby boy she named Francesco (Francis), after the pope. While I'm sure he's honored, he's got to be wondering about the real father (I know I am!). The nun simply said, ""I did not know. I only felt a stomach pain,"" <a href=""http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2541685/Nun-gives-birth-rushed-hospital-stomach-pains-says-no-idea-pregnant.html"" target=""_blank"">wrote <em>Daily Mail</em></a>. Maybe immaculate conception?Judging by the comments on the article, most of the readers think she's full of it! Other than the hilarious jokes, the most common question was; ""How can any woman be unaware she's pregnant? Seriously."" Personally, I don't know about making it to 40 weeks without getting a clue, but as embarrassing as it is, I can admit that I got to 23 weeks—yep, five and a half months—before I realized I was pregnant!I can explain, really! While carrying my seventh baby, I started showing signs of pre-eclampsia, but test after test ruled it out. At only 24 weeks, I had to stay in the hospital while they tried to figure out what was going on. Unfortunately, they discovered I had kidney and vascular disease, but thankfully the baby was stable. At 37 weeks, I delivered my healthy son, Justin, who was welcomed to the family by his daddy, five big brothers and one big sister. My doctors made it very clear that for my own safety, I couldn't have any more children.Justin was <em>such</em> a sweet and mellow baby. The only problem I had was with breastfeeding. Because of the kidney disease, I had trouble making enough milk to feed him. By the time he was 2 months old, I ended up using a <em>Supplemental Nursing System</em> (<em>SNS</em>); a feeding tube that attaches to your nipple and a container of formula so baby gets enough nutrition while still breastfeeding. I felt <em>awful,</em> no doubt from my hormones, but he took to it with no problem. After a few months, my breasts hurt so much! I figured his latch was different than I was used to and ignored it.After having no issues with the <em>SNS</em> for weeks, Justin started to push away from my breast and grumble. From experience, I assumed my cycle was going to start soon. With my other babies, I could actually tell from how they acted and from the smell of the milk. With formula involved, I could only go by Justin's behavior. I waited and waited, but no period, which was fine by me! I didn't think it was a big deal because with breastfeeding there's really no set time for your period to return.Every day, I would put Justin into the sling, put my toddlers in a stroller and go to the park close to our house. I started getting so tired I could barely make it out the door. I also had horrible gas pains, but I don't think I want to go there! Eventually, I mentioned to my doctor that I was having a lot of nausea, fatigue and bloating. He said they were common side effects from one of my medications and prescribed a nursing-safe anti-nausea drug. I went on my merry way and didn't think anything about it.Then came the time to figure out what type of birth control I was going to use. My nephrologist (kidney doctor) wanted me to talk to the OB/GYN about having my tubes tied. Laying on the exam table in that most uncomfortable position, I heard a gasp followed by ""Oh, Margie"" (in that voice your dad used when you brought home a bad report card). I even felt ashamed for a second before I blurted out, ""Wait, what? What did I do?"" He stood up and said, ""You are <em>so</em> pregnant.""After the ""you can't have this baby or you'll die"" conversation, he sent me straight to the imaging department for an ultrasound. I called my husband to meet me there; both of us were in total shock. We thought we'd been pretty careful; besides, I was breastfeeding full-time! We sat in stunned silence as the measurements were calculated and we were told I was about 23 weeks along and he would be Boy No. 7. Looking back, I think using the <em>SNS</em> and Justin's nibbles of solid foods allowed for me to ovulate.After going against the medical advice of four doctors, we decided to keep our baby. He was nearly at a viable stage, and I wasn't comfortable with the other option. After making the decision, the biggest obstacle was dealing with our teenagers, who were understandably angry. At 34 weeks, Adam was born via emergency Cesarean due to a placental abruption. As they were knocking me out, I started yelling, ""Tie my tubes! Don't forget to tie my tubes!""When I hear the ""I had no idea..."" stories now, I sympathize a little more, but I still wonder about making it the full nine months without knowing. I still laugh to myself, <em>a little</em>. My surprise baby, Adam, is 8 years old now and truly my ""baby"" in every way. I baby him too much, and he eats it up and works it like a pro! Whenever I tell the story of my pregnancy with him, I always give the little preamble: ""You know those crazy women who give birth on airplanes?"" <a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=111283151&amp;src=id"" target=""_blank"">Shutterstock image</a>"
 When Breast and Bottle Both Are Best,http://www.parenting.com/article/when-breast-and-bottle-both-are-best,"But once home, Clara's blissful ideas of breastfeeding were turned upside down. ""If Zach wasn't on the breast, he was crying,"" she remembers. ""The lactation consultant I called weighed him after a feeding and said she wasn't sure he was getting enough milk. But she told me not to supplement and to put him on my breast as often as he wanted to be there, which was every hour and a half."" She followed the consultant's instructions, using a supplemental nutrition system (or SNS, a device that allows milk to be suspended in a container around a woman's neck and delivered to a feeding baby through a tube laid next to the woman's nipple) while she breastfed as well as pumping in between feedings.Clara, who was taking a few months off from her job, managed to keep up with this grueling schedule for several weeks. Eventually -- rundown, tearful, and anxious about her baby -- she developed mastitis. Zach got thrush (a yeast infection of the mouth) from Clara's antibiotics, Clara herself got nipple thrush, and, on top of all that, Zach was still crying all the time. Meanwhile, she hadn't slept for more than a two-hour stretch since she'd given birth. ""Because of the terrible fatigue and my anxiety over his not gaining much weight,"" she says, ""I thought I might have to give up breastfeeding altogether, which I really didn't want to do.""Fortunately, Clara's pediatrician took one look at the crying, unhappy baby and mom on the verge and advised Clara to supplement with formula, right away. Although her lactation consultant had warned her against it, she felt that she had exhausted all other options.Almost immediately, the situation improved. Zach, finally satisfied, switched easily between breast and bottle. Clara's anxiety lifted, she got more sleep, and she began bonding with Zach during feedings. ""I guess I just needed someone to give me permission to supplement,"" she says. ""It made our lives easier, and we still had the advantages of breastfeeding. But no one ever told me I could do it.""But let's also finally admit it: Breastfeeding exclusively is extremely difficult for some 10 to 20 percent of women, says James Sargent, M.D., a pediatrician and researcher at Dartmouth Medical School, in Lebanon, New Hampshire. And according to <span style=""font-style: italic;"">Babyalk </span>contributing editor and lactation specialist Marianne Neifert, M.D., author of <i>Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding</i> and one of the country's top experts on the subject, up to 5 percent of women suffer from breast milk shortage, making exclusive breastfeeding practically impossible.But when one of these frustrated moms hears from ardent breastfeeding advocates that she shouldn't supplement with a bottle (let alone formula), she may decide to abandon breastfeeding altogether, thinking it's an all-or-nothing proposition. ""Moms are often told very strongly that regardless of how hard a time they're having, they should breastfeed exclusively,"" says Dr. Sargent. ""But that may not always be appropriate. The downsides (ranging from a distressed baby and a miserable mother to a malnourished and dehydrated infant) can actually outweigh the benefits.""The answer for many women who struggle with exclusive nursing may be to combine breastfeeding with bottlefeeding. Many experts agree that some breastfeeding is better than none at all.If you suspect that breastfeeding isn't satisfying your baby, ask your baby's doctor to help you confirm the problem. Your baby's weight is a good indicator of how well she's feeding, and there are two ways to evaluate this. Since newborns shouldn't lose more than 10 percent of their birth weight in the first few days of life and should surpass it by 2 weeks of age, your pediatrician may weigh your infant while she's naked to compare her current weight with her birth weight. Another weight test involves what doctors call a ""representative feeding,"" which will give your pediatrician an idea of how much milk your baby takes at a typical breastfeeding. To do this, he'll weigh your baby with her clothes on, ask you to nurse her, and then reweigh her in the same clothes. The change in her weight after a feeding represents the amount of milk she drank from your breasts. ""By two to three weeks of age, for example,"" says Dr. Neifert, ""a baby should be taking in about one ounce of milk per hour. So, we would expect her to have gained about two ounces two hours after she nursed. If the gain is considerably less than this, there may be a problem.""Dr. Neifert also suggests that you ask your ob-gyn to do a thorough ""lactation assessment,"" which should include a medical history to uncover any conditions, such as breast surgery or hormone problems, that could interfere with successful breastfeeding. Ask your doctor to evaluate your breast appearance as well -- including size, shape, and symmetry. Some women, says Dr. Neifert, through no fault of their own, have underdeveloped breasts that render them unable to make enough milk, and small-breasted women may have to nurse more often because their breasts may not hold as much milk, increasing the chance of nipple sores, cracks, and bleeding. ""This is a biological difference in women that no one will admit to,"" says Dr. Neifert.When faced with a mom who is physically unable to supply enough breast milk to her baby, Dr. Neifert usually recommends what she calls a ""triple feeding"":<b>1.</b> Temporarily restrict the duration of breastfeeding to 20 minutes (10 minutes per side).<b>2.</b> When you finish breastfeeding, have your spouse or another caregiver feed the baby as much extra milk (either previously expressed breast milk or formula) as necessary to satisfy her. (A breastfed baby often accepts a bottle more readily from another caretaker because she expects to breastfeed from her mother.)<b>3.</b> While your baby is drinking her supplement, use an electric double breastpump for 10 minutes to extract any residual milk in your breasts and stimulate additional production. Refrigerate the milk you express.<b>4.</b> At the next feeding, repeat the cycle. After breastfeedding, supplement first with your expressed milk, then offer additional formula as needed.Over time, says Dr. Neifert, triple feedings will help build up your milk supply while assuring your baby is adequately nourished, and you may be able to return to exclusive breastfeeding if you wish to. The rigors of a triple feeding schedule aren't for every woman: some are too exhausted or have too many other responsibilities to devote the necessary time and energy to this demanding regimen. ""It's important for the mother to choose whether she feels she can add in pumping,"" says Dr. Neifert. If you'd rather not, you might want to follow the instructions below.Consider 41-year-old magazine editor Jane Peterson's experience. ""When I had Ben six years ago, there was less awareness than there is today about what to do when you had breastfeeding problems,"" she says. Jane had planned to breastfeed exclusively for several months, but within the first week, she experienced a number of problems. ""Ben wanted to nurse every hour,"" says the Cleveland, OH, mom. ""He was a big baby, and he was hungry! He was gaining weight and my milk supply was fine, but I wasn't sleeping. Into the second week, my nipples were sore, cracked, and bleeding, Ben was still feeding once an hour, and in the evenings he would have a colicky period and cry for hours. My life was a blur of exhaustion and pain.""Jane knew pumping was out of the question because her breasts were far too sore and raw, and she knew that when she went back to work she wouldn't be in an environment where pumping was appropriate. At that point, Jane called her sister, who had nursed two babies, and told her she couldn't go on. ""I sobbed and sobbed,"" she says. ""My sister said, 'Jane, give him a bottle of formula, now.'""The next evening she had her husband give Ben a bottle in the next room. A little while later her husband came in carrying a sleeping Ben and gave her the thumbs up. That night, Ben slept for several hours straight -- and so did his exhausted mom. The difference was in the formula: It remains in Baby's stomach longer than breast milk (which is more rapidly digested by Baby's immature system), and that extra hour or two break from feeding can make all the difference.For many women, combining breast with bottle is simply the best choice for them and their baby. ""Doing the combo allowed me to have the best of both worlds,"" says Jane. ""Only then did I experience the bliss of breastfeeding -- after I was able to heal my sore breasts and finally get some sleep.""<i>Donna Jackson writes for many national magazines and has two children.</i>"

So when I got pregnant, it was a huge shock to my system (both physically and emotionally) to cut out some of the activities I loved. I always heard that you could continue doing during your pregnancy what you were doing before. But my doctor advised otherwise, and I listened. No softball, no running, no spin class, no getting your heart rate above 140… What’s a girl to do without spin class?! This void, coupled with a ridiculous case of eczema, had me questioning why anyone would ever have more than one kid. For the first few months, I really lost who I was. Enter prenatal yoga. I’ll be honest. I had always assumed yoga was for people who didn’t like high-impact sports. I went to one yoga class at my gym and thought it was just plain boring. Boy was I wrong. At 13 weeks, after I announced to the world that I was pregnant, I went to my first yoga class at a local studio. After the first 5 minutes, I was in love. Yoga has so many benefits. During pregnancy (and I’m sure after pregnancy) it’s helping me mentally. It’s something I look forward to each week. During the class, I focus on how my body is feeling. I focus on my breathing. And I focus on how proud I am of myself. It sounds silly, but I’m proud of how I’m handling my changing life and body, especially when dealing with crazy debilitating symptoms. The teacher is positive, calm, a mom of four boys and has the most radiant positive energy. It’s contagious. And it doesn’t hurt that she occasionally comes up and gives you a hand massage while you’re in child’s pose. It’s also one of the best workouts I’ve ever done. There’s nothing boring about it. I leave every class with quivering quads and sore shoulders. I can feel that it’s keeping my ever-changing body nimble and flexible. I started having bad sciatic issues during my first trimester. After 2 weeks of yoga, the symptoms were gone. My husband has even jumped on the yoga bandwagon and does the hot yoga class while I’m in my pregnancy class. It’s so healthy for him to supplement his normal pick-things-up-and-put-them-down gym sessions with a class that focuses on flexibility, agility and core strength training. Above all, yoga has helped me maintain who I am and what I love throughout pregnancy. I definitely gave up too much at first. I changed my life too much and too drastically during my first trimester. Partially because I was terrified of hurting my baby. Partially because I felt awful. But now I realize how important it is to stay true to yourself. As everyone always says: You can’t have a healthy baby without a healthy mom. And part of being healthy physically is staying healthy mentally. During our 20-week ultrasound, we saw that our baby’s feet are way above her head. Her knees are practically in her mouth. I’m pretty sure she’s practicing yoga with me :) How did you learn to cope with your new pregnant self? Did you pick up any new hobbies during pregnancy to supplement others that you had to give up?"

Of course, you already know how important a balanced diet full of whole grains, vegetables, fruit and lean proteins is, but one thing I always found missing from babies' diet was fish. Parents just didn't seem to think it--and other seafood--was a ""baby"" food.Over the years, study after study has supported that omega-3 fatty acids--essential nutrients found in seafood--help promote infant brain development as well as boost immunity and vision. In fact, they're good for nearly every organ, even baby's super-soft skin. Even moms can benefit: The latest research shows that women who ate adequate amounts of omega-3s during pregnancy were less likely to experience postpartum depression. Read on for advice on introducing seafood into your child's diet.<strong>Fish Talk</strong><br>The lowdown on which seafood is tops--and why.</br><strong>What types of fish are best for baby?</strong> Salmon is by far the best source of DHA*--the star of the omega-3 world. But almost all seafood contains omega-3s, so try to give your baby a variety of low-mercury fish.<strong>How much fish should my baby eat?</strong> For babies just starting out on solids, I recommend about 2 ounces of wild salmon per week. After your baby is off formula or breast milk, give her 6 to 7 ounces per week. If you find it difficult to reach that amount, consider a supplement. Ask your doctor for a recommendation, or try my own DHA liquid, <a href=""http://www.drsearsfamilyessentials.com/"">GoFish</a>.<strong>Should pregnant and breastfeeding women eat more fish</strong>? I recommend that pregnant and lactating women eat 6 ounces of wild salmon twice a week. In addition, make sure you talk to your doctor about consuming at least 650 milligrams of DHA daily from prenatal supplements.<strong>* WHAT'S DHA?</strong> You see it on formula labels, but did you know that it's also abundant in fish? DHA, short for docosahexaenoic acid, is an omega-3 essential fatty acid vital for brain and eye development<strong>Fish Food</strong><br>Doubtful your baby will eat fish? Offer it early on, and it just may become a favorite food. Start with salmon, and try these tips:</br><strong>Don't stress it.</strong> Blend the salmon flakes into pasta or mashed potatoes. Another option: <a href=""http://happybabyfood.com/"">HappyBaby</a>'s frozen meal of wild salmon, lentils and sweet potatoes.<strong>Spread it.</strong> Puree cooked wild salmon (canned or steamed fresh) with lemon, olive oil and seasonings and then spread it on bread or crackers.<strong>Strip it down.</strong> Older babies might enjoy ""fish fingers."" Dip inch-wide strips of deboned salmon fillets into beaten egg and coat them with a mixture of whole-wheat flour, whole-wheat bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and a dash of salt. Bake for about eight minutes.<strong>Mercury Meter</strong>Some seafood has too much methylmercury, a toxin that can affect the brain. Here's a checklist of safe, low-mercury fish you can give baby: canned light tuna, cod, catfish, pollock and salmon. Other safe seafood includes shrimp, clams, crab and scallops. My favorite website for buying safe seafood is <a href=""http://www.vitalchoice.com/shop/pc/home.asp"">vitalchoice.com</a>."

Do they contain the same key ingredients as brand-name formulas?</strong>All formulas must meet the nutrient standards set by the Food and Drug Administration, and generic formulas are nutritionally sound, says William Klish, M.D., professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX. However, they don't always have the added supplements that many brand names do.<strong>Q. I find the labels confusing. Any tips on how to best interpret what's there?</strong>There is a ton of information to decipher, says Ann Condon-Meyers, a clinical nutritionist at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. It's always good to ask your pediatrician what she recommends, since there are reasons to give certain babies a specific type. Assuming you can start with the basics, the first thing to look for is one that's iron-fortified. You'll also see brands that contain DHA and ARA, two fatty acids that are abundant in breast milk and can enhance development of the brain, eyes, and nervous system. The research on the benefits of these supplements is growing, and doctors are increasingly recommending them. These formulas may be a bit pricier, but they're very likely worth the splurge.<strong>Q. What's the difference between premixed and dry formula? And if I use dry, does it matter what sort of water I mix it with?</strong>The two types are equivalent -- the premixed formulas simply already have water added to them, Condon-Meyers says. ""If you find yourself in a situation where you're unsure of the water supply, or if you're sending your baby to daycare and you want to make sure no mistakes are made in the mixing process, consider buying premixed formula,"" she adds. ""If you use powdered, many doctors suggest sterilizing the water in the early months; after that, tap water is fine."" Boil the water for a few minutes -- especially if you have well water -- and then let it cool to room temperature before mixing.<strong>Q. Should I go organic? I've read that some contain more sugar than regular formula.</strong>Nutritionally, the organic formulas are the same as any other, says Dr. Klish. And though some do contain sucrose, which may be a bit sweeter than other sugars, it's still on par with sugars in other formulas. The bottom line? ""This is more of an emotional decision than a health one,"" says Dr. Klish. If living an organic lifestyle is important to your family, then by all means go for it -- just be prepared to spend extra."
