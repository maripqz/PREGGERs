 Fish Oil Supplements Don’t Make Babies Smarter,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/melanie-parentingcom/fish-oil-supplements-don-t-make-babies-smarter,"Good news for those of us who were feeling guilty for not taking fish oil supplements during pregnancy, reports the  New York Times . A large study published on Tuesday in the  Journal of the American Medical Association  suggests that DHA (docosahexaenoic acid; an omega-3 fatty acid and a key ingredient in fish oil) supplements taken by pregnant women do not show a clear cognitive benefit to their babies, and that DHA does not reduce postpartum depression, except potentially in women at high risk for it. Some earlier studies suggested that, if taken during pregnancy, DHA could aid in a babys brain development, but the studies were small or only observed women already taking fish oil, possibly indicating they were more health-conscious overall. The new study, a clinical trial that included more than 2,000 participants, followed women who received either fish oil with DHA or a vegetable oil placebo and then assessed their babies. DHA, which is naturally transmitted to a fetus through the placenta in the second half of pregnancy, is thought to be important to visual and brain development, but the study found no cognitive difference in the babies at 18 months, possibly suggesting that full-term babies get sufficient DHA in the womb, and that supplementation was unnecessary. Additional assessments are planned at ages 4 and 7. Although the study didnt find that DHA made babies smarter, several experts said they would continue to support taking DHA in pregnancy because it did suggest that DHA supplementation in pregnancy reduces the likelihood of premature birth. The study also found that it slightly decreased postpartum depression in women with histories or high risk of depression. Did you take DHA supplements during your pregnancy?"
 Teens Are Using Risky Supplements to Improve Their Appearance,http://www.parenting.com/news-break/teens-are-using-risky-supplements-to-improve-their-appearance,"The Short of It Doctors are warning parents that their teens could be using unregulated supplements as appearance enhancers. The Lowdown Pediatricians from the U.S. Council on Sports Medicine and Fitness are warning parents about  teens using risky, unregulated supplements to improve their looks . Teens are using things like protein powders, steroids and diet pills, which the American Academy of Pediatrics says are at best, useless, and at worst, toxic. Based on a survey of students in grades 8 through 12, 20 percent of the boys said they take protein supplements; one in five use creatine,  which reportedly revs up energy in cells ; and a scary 5 to 7 percent are using steroids. ""Doctors think of performance-enhancing substance use as an athlete problem, but  many non-athletes are using these substances for appearance enhancement ,"" says report co-author Dr. Michele LaBotz. More from News Break:   A Teen's Life Is Changed Just for Offering to Carry One Man's Groceries While boys tend to go for protein supplements, caffeine, steroids, and creatine, nonprescription weight-loss supplements are popular with girls. It's the over-the-counter supplementsderegulated in 1994that the kids are turning to, and according to LaBotz, studies have shown that many of them are contaminated with toxic heavy metals, such as lead and mercury, or mixed with steroids and stimulants, like amphetamines. ""Substances spiked with stimulants put you at  higher risk for cardiovascular problems ,"" LaBotz explains. ""If you are one of the many teens already on stimulants for ADHD, you're compounding the risk of heart problems."" And the effects of steroids are even worse. ""A lot of the effects of steroids are irreversible, including stunted growth and the growth of male breasts,"" LaBotz adds. ""These don't go away when you stop putting steroids in your body."" Not to mention the fact that suddenly stopping them can lead to depression and heightened risk of suicide, she notes. Scary stuff! That's why the AAP is now urging doctors to educate parents and teens about the dangers of these supplements in order to discourage their use.

 Who knew I’d become a supplement junkie?,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/project-pregnancy/amanda-jo-greep/who-knew-i-d-become-supplement-junkie,"Ive never been much of a vitamin taker. Ive always had good intentions, but really, Im a world class procrastinator at heart so far too many of my good intentions get permanently filed away in the Ill do it tomorrow file, rarely to be heard from again. That inclination, combined with reports that multivitamins  may not ultimately be useful   especially for people with good, well-rounded diets already  has just given me further excuse to not bother. But now, during this pregnancy, I find myself popping about 10 different pills every night.  And  seeing clear, positive results. This cynic has become a believer. At the beginning, it was just a prenatal vitamin. Every pregnant woman is encouraged to take them, so as soon as I got the positive pregnancy test, I dutifully bought a new bottle and worked it back into my daily routine. Then my midwife tested my vitamin D levels as part of a routine blood draw at the start of my second trimester and while the results werent abysmal, they certainly couldve been better. So I stopped at the local food co-op and picked up some supplements. And tossed a bottle of  fish oil  and some  probiotics  in my basket as well, for good measure. A few weeks later, I had a cold sore outbreak on my lip. Then another as soon as that one healed. And when I started to feel the tingling of a third ($#&$!), I called my midwife. Then went  back  to the local co-op for a bottle of lysine. Repeat the above scenario for  the worlds worst Charley Horse  and a bottle of Calcium Magnesium found its way to my kitchen counter as well. Initially, I felt silly popping all these pills each night. But then my cold sore outbreaks stopped dead in their tracks and at my next blood draw, my vitamin D levels had soared to optimal levels.  And  I havent had a single Charley Horse  or even small leg cramp  in the 8 weeks since I started taking Calcium Magnesium. I call all of that a big WIN. Now its time to tackle the insane  acid reflux  that has been plaguing me for the last several weeks. Im out of my stock of Tums at the moment, and I have to pop them like candy throughout the day just to keep the reflux at bay, so Im going to try some  apple cider vinegar  tonight and swing by the food co-op yet again tomorrow for a bottle of papaya enzymes. Heres to hoping these new additions have as much of a positive impact as everything else has. And here's to hoping I can find room on my counter for them somewhere. Space is getting tight :) [This should go without saying, but just in case  always check with your care provider before starting or stopping any medications or supplements, especially when pregnant.

 DHA & Kids: A Smart Supplement,http://www.parenting.com/article/dha-a-smart-supplement,"Research shows that DHA, an omega-3 fatty acid that's been shown to boost a baby's brain development, is good for children of all ages. Here's how much DHA kids need -- and the best sources, from David Perlmutter, M.D., a leading expert in the field and a neurologist in Naples, FL: Unborn babies Benefit:  DHA during pregnancy can increase a child's IQ by age 4. How much:  Pregnant women should get 400 mg or more daily. Prenatal vitamins don't have enough, so take a vegetarian supplement -- not fish oil, which can contain mercury. Newborns to 6 months Benefit:  Better hand-eye coordination at 2 years compared with babies who didn't get enough. How much:  Breastfed babies get all they need from you as long as you're taking a daily supplement of 400 mg or more. If you're not nursing, look for formula containing at least 19 mg of DHA per five-ounce serving. 6 months to 2 years Benefit:  DHA jump starts the production of a hormone that's crucial for brain development during this time of rapid growth. How much:  100 mg daily or more from foods marked DHA-enriched, like some yogurt, cereal, and -- once your child turns 1 -- milk and eggs. And serve wild Alaskan salmon, the best natural food source that's also low in mercury. Up to four 1- to 2-ounce servings a week is safe. Kids 2 to 5 years Benefit:  Low levels of DHA in children have been linked to an increased risk of ADHD, vision problems, and depression. How much:  200 mg daily or more from DHA-enriched foods (see above) and wild Alaskan salmon (up to four 3-ounce servings per week)."
 Can I take herbal supplements during pregnancy?,http://www.parenting.com/article/can-i-take-herbal-supplements-during-pregnancy,Dont take herbal remedies unless prescribed by your doctor since not enough information is known about their safety.
 Ask Dr. Sears: Vitamin Overdose,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-vitamin-overdose,"Q Do you recommend vitamin supplements? If yes, which vitamins should my baby get? Is there any chance that a baby can overdose on vitamins if she also drinks formula and eats vitamin-fortified cereals? AIt's important that your baby get the right amount of vitamins, since your baby needs adequate amounts of these nutrients for optimal growth. It is wise not to give your baby more than the recommended daily allowancethe RDA, also called daily value or DV. Yet, giving your baby an excess of most vitamins will cause no harm. Your baby will only excrete the excess in her urine. (Very high excess doses of vitamin A can be harmful, but only at approximately ten times the RDA.) The label on formula cans and food labels, such as some cereal boxes, list the RDA's of essential nutrients. Here's a rundown of the eleven most common vitamins, and their health benefits: Vitamin A promotes healthy vision, skin, and teeth, and also boosts the immune system. The B vitamins (B-1, B-2, B-3, B-6, and B-12) are necessary for proper energy conversion at the cellular level and help boost the immune system and central nervous system. Vitamin C promotes healthy blood vessels, immune system, and neurotransmitters in the brain. Vitamin D promotes absorption of calcium and phosphorous for strong bones. Vitamin E acts like an antioxidant protecting cell membranes from damage. Vitamin F (folic acid) helps build healthy red blood cells and is important in the formation of normal spinal bones, especially in the preborn baby. Vitamin K helps promote proper blood clotting. Concerning the formula issue, all commercially available infant formulas contain the recommended amount of vitamins. If your baby gets 32 ounces of formula a day, then she is getting enough vitamins. If, however, she takes less than 32 ounces, a multi-vitamin supplement is recommended. When you start adding solid foods, she will also be getting vitamins from solids. You don't need to worry about her getting too much, as it's nearly impossible for baby to ""overdose"" on too much vitamins from foods. Breastfed babies generally do not need vitamin supplements. There is some new evidence that suggests some breastfeeding babies or their mothers,especially if they are African-American,may need vitamin D supplements during the winter months if they are not exposed to at least ten minutes of sunlight a day. Also infants with nutritional needs for catch-up growth, such as premature infants, usually need vitamin, mineral, and iron supplements for at least the first year. Besides vitamins, it's important that babies get enough minerals in their diet, which is why you will notice that some supplements are listed as a ""multi-vitamin/multi-mineral"" preparation. And one of the most important minerals to be sure your baby gets enough of is iron, especially after six months of age. At this point, babies begin to use up all their extra iron stores from the mothers blood at birth. This is why it's important to always use an iron-fortified formula, and not a ""low iron"" formula. Iron is necessary for your baby to make enough red blood cells. Your doctor will routinely measure your infant's iron levels in her hemoglobin around the nine-month well-baby checkup. Infant cereals are also fortified with vitamins and minerals. So, if your baby is taking 32 ounces of formula plus eating solid foods, you can be reassured that she has a vitamin-sufficient diet."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Combo-Feeding Tips,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-combo-feeding-tips,"Q. My  milk  flow is generally slow and my daughter doesn't get enough at a feeding, so our lactation consultant has suggested that we supplement with formula. Sometimes, I'll only express two ounces of milk at a time, but I'm wondering if I can I mix the breast milk I've expressed with an equal amount of formula in the same bottle for a feeding? A. Yes, it's perfectly fine to mix breast milk and formula in the same bottle. Also, you can both breast- and bottle-feed successfully. However, there are certain rules of the game that combo-feeders have learned. In our practice, when a mother needs to combo-feed (for example, when returning to work), we recommend ways that Mom can continue to keep her milk supply up while giving her baby supplemental bottles. If you choose to supplement without actively maintaining your breast milk supply, you run the risk of your milk dwindling, leading to weaning before you and your baby is ready. Here are a few ways to keep things flowing: Think milk! Once upon a time, it was considered routine to tell breastfeeding mothers to give their baby a bottle for all kinds of unnecessary reasons, such as ""to get the baby used to it,"" and to give the mother relief from nursing. Studies have shown that this kind of advice undermines the confidence of a mother because it implies that you won't have enough milk for your baby; and that often becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. The newest trend in breastfeeding-friendly hospital nurseries is to not send mom home with a discharge pack containing formula or give her any advice that suggests that she may not have enough milk. Producing breastmilk is not only a physical experience, it's emotional as well. While you feed your baby, imagine your milk flowingand imagine yourself making lots of milk. If you worry you won't ave enough milk for your baby, you won't. Breast association. You want your baby to associate you with feeding, and to know that milk is coming from your breast, not a bottle. Your baby should associate breastfeeding with nutrition and comfort. When you must give her a bottle, have Dad or a caregiver offer it. Feed more frequently. ""Frequency"" is the magic word for increasing milk supply. Breastfeeding your baby at least every two hours is an optimal schedule to follow. Nap-nurse and co-sleep. A couple times a day lie down and breastfeed your baby off to sleep. The relaxing environment of napping with your baby will often work increase your milk supply. Also,  co-sleeping  with your baby is another method that is thought to help. Sling feed. Wear your baby in a sling-type carrier as often as you can throughout the day, as proximity fosters feeding. If your baby is inches away from her favorite food, she's likely to eat more often! Finally, remember to take care of yourself. If  you  are happy and rested, you will make more milk. From the description of your feeding pattern, I'm concerned that if you continue increasing the frequency of bottle-feeding, your milk supply will also continue to dwindle. But if you reverse the trend and think of bottles as a supplement, or in addition to your daughter's primary source of foodbreast milkyour supply should at least stay the same, if not improve. I hope you can work out a feeding plan that you enjoy. You're going to spend more time feeding your baby than any other single interaction during the first yearso, enjoy it!"
 Your Breastfeeding Problems Solved!,http://www.parenting.com/article/your-breastfeeding-problems-solved,"Latch-On 101 Q. My baby is due in a month, and I'm very eager to breastfeed. However, my nipples are flat, which I've heard can make latch-on more difficult. Do you have any suggestions that will help my baby breastfeed successfully? A.  While protuberant nipples can make grasping the breast easier for a baby, an infant can certainly learn to nurse effectively from flat, and even inverted, nipples. Try the following latch-on technique for nursing using the traditional cradle hold: Support your baby using your arm on the same side you will be breastfeeding. Her head should be resting in the crook of your elbow or on your forearm. Rotate your arm to turn your baby's whole body toward you, so the two of you are chest-to-chest. During the learning period, it is important that you support your breast using your opposite hand to help your baby stay well attached. Cup your four fingers under your breast, placing your index finger and thumb parallel to your baby's jaws and well behind the margin of your areola, the dark circular area surrounding your nipple. Your baby needs to grasp the entire nipple, plus at least one inch of surrounding areola and breast so her jaws are situated over your milk ducts. With your baby turned toward you, lightly stroke the midpoint of her lips against your nipple until she opens her mouth widely, as if yawning, and then quickly pull her onto your breast. When she is latched on correctly, her mouth will be wide open with her lips flared out (a bit like a fish), her nose resting against your upper breast, and her chin against the underside of your breast. She will not grasp sufficient breast tissue if you try to push your nipple into her mouth or attempt to attach her when her mouth is only slightly open. Some health-care providers recommend the use of breast shells, also known as milk cups, for women with flat or inverted nipples. These hard, plastic, dome-shaped devices can help make the nipple more protuberant by directing it forward through a central opening in the shell. This opening is situated over your nipple, and the device is held in place by a maternity bra during the last month or two of pregnancy. (Breast shells can also be worn between feedings after the baby is born.) Another strategy for making a flat or inverted nipple easier to grasp is to use a breast pump to draw it out before you feed your infant. Don't be afraid to ask for help if you're having difficulty. Ideally, your first breastfeeding session will occur within 30 to 60 minutes after giving birth, when your baby's sucking instinct is most intense and help from a knowledgeable lactation consultant or nurse is readily available. Contributing editor Marianne Neifert, M.D., is co-founder and medical consultant to the HealthOne Lactation Program in Denver, Colorado, and author of  Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding. Haven't Got Time for the Pain Q. I developed painful cracks on both nipples three days after delivery. Now, a week later, nursing is still so uncomfortable that I actually dread it. My friends tell me to tough it out, but if the pain continues much longer, I'll quit. Am I doing something wrong? A.  Most women experience mild, temporary discomfort for the first few days of breastfeeeding, but the painful, cracked nipples you describe at ten days postpartum are not a normal part of nursing. If your baby's doctor or your own is not comfortable examining your nipples and assessing your breastfeeding technique, ask to be referred to a lactation consultant. Even if you have to pay for this service, this is money well spent. Although the major cause of severe or chronic sore nipples is trauma from incorrect latch-on and sucking, other factors can play a part in exacerbating the problem. For example, inappropriate nipple care-- such as overdrying or excessive moisture-- can delay healing. Furthermore, nipple cracks and wounds are easily infected by bacteria or yeast present in the baby's mouth. So first make sure your baby is latched on correctly, then take care of your nipples. Try applying medical grade ultrapure lanolin after feedings or wearing new moisture-retaining, hydrogel dressings between feedings for a soothing skin barrier. In addition, your doctor can prescribe an antibiotic or an antifungal medication if an infection is present. To continue nursing more comfortably while your nipples heal, begin breastfeeding on the least sore side to trigger your milk-ejection reflex. Once milk flow has begun, the baby should suck less vigorously when brought to the second, more irritated breast. Frequent, short feedings are preferable, since delaying the interval between feedings results in greater breast engorgement and a ravenously hungry baby-- a combination that can cause further trauma during nursing. If your nipple pain is so severe that you must interrupt breastfeeding, you can temporarily express your breastmilk using a fully automatic, electric breast pump, which usually is more comfortable than your sucking baby. Use the pump at regular feeding times, and feed the expressed milk to your infant until your nipples have healed. Breastfeeder's Block Q. While breastfeeding my 2-month-old baby, I experienced several painful plugged ducts-- twice on one breast and once on the other. Is there anything I can do to avoid a recurrence? A.  A plugged duct, also known as a blocked duct or a caked breast, results when one of the milk ducts draining the lobes of the breast becomes partially obstructed. It creates a firm, tender, engorged area of the breast, and often an elongated lump can be felt. Since milk glands are concentrated in the outer areas of the breast, blocked ducts are common near the armpits. If not quickly remedied, a blocked duct can progress to a breast infection known as mastitis (discussed below), which should be suspected whever redness is present. A blocked duct usually occurs when you haven't breastfed your baby often or long enough. Women who produce abundant milk are particularly prone to this problem, and being separated from your infant or going a long time without nursing is another common risk factor. In addition, constrictive clothing, such as a tight underwire bra or straps from a baby carrier that are pulled too tight, can interfere with milk flow. The most effective way to relieve a blocked duct is to nurse your baby as much as possible. Starting several consecutive feedings on the affected side will help, since babies nurse more vigorously and take more milk from the first breast. You can also place your baby so that her chin points toward the plugged duct, a position that will help promote drainage. Warm compresses or a warm shower can trigger your let-down reflex and improve milk flow, and gentle massage of the blocked area is often effective in relieving the obstruction. Be careful not to press too firmly, however, as causing trauma to your breast increases the risk of mastitis. If, for some reason, your breast isn't well drained after nursing, use a breast pump to remove extra milk. Recurrent clogged ducts can be a sign of breast inflammation or low-grade infection; treatment with antibiotics sometimes curbs the problem. Occasionally, a breast lump is mistaken for a clogged duct. Any lump which persists for more than several days should be checked by a doctor. Mastering Mastitis Q. I returned to work full-time when my baby was 12 weeks old. I continue to breastfeed when I'm with my baby, and I pump at the office. Since I have been back, however, I have had two bouts of mastitis, both in the same breast. What causes mastitis, and what can I do to avoid it? A.  Mastitis, or a breast infection, occurs in at least two percent of breastfeeding women. Flu-like symptoms are typical-- fever, chills, headache, body aches, and fatigue-- along with an area of the breast that is tender, red, and firm. Mastitis is often preceded by a clogged duct, an infected cracked nipple, irregular or ineffective milk removal, or simple exhaustion. Working mothers often develop mastitis when they are unable to express their milk at regular intervals and become sleep-deprived and physically depleted. Mastitis should be promptly treated with appropriate antibiotics for 10 to 14 days. If infection occurs while you are breastfeeding a healthy baby, you should continue nursing. If you don't, your milk production will likely decrease, making breastfeeding more difficult after the infection has cleared. Nurse your baby on the unaffected breast first, and move him to the painful breast only once the let-down reflex has been triggered. Ibuprofen can help reduce inflammation and pain, and ice or warm packs can provide comfort. If direct breastfeeding is too painful or milk flow is impaired, you should express your milk. Recurrences often happen when an ineffective antibiotic is prescribed or when the course of treatment is too short. The best way to avoid another bout of mastitis: Pump on a regular schedule while you are at work (at least every four hours), and nurse your baby often when the two of you are together. To reduce your level of fatigue, curtail any unnecessary activities, enlist help with household chores, try to get extra sleep, drink plenty of fluids, and eat regular meals. Fill 'Er Up Q. My first baby was formula-fed, but my doctor is urging me to breastfeed my second baby, who's due in three months. I'm used to seeing how much milk a baby takes from a bottle, and I'm concerned that I won't know if my newborn is satisfied with breastfeeding. How will I be able to tell? A.  Even though your breasts don't have calibrations, a number of indicators can help reassure you about your baby's milk intake. The most reliable is your baby's weight. Although your newborn will lose a little weight at first, once abundant milk production begins about the third day postpartum, he will start drinking greater quantities of milk and gain weight rapidly. He will likely surpass his birth weight by 10 to 14 days of age. On average, breastfed babies gain about an ounce each day, or nearly a pound every two weeks, for the first two to three months of life, after which their rate of weight gain tapers. Since ""what goes in must come out,"" you should also watch the contents of your baby's diaper. Well-fed newborn babies should have at least four sizable, yellow, seedy bowel movements each day. Infrequent or scant bowel movements, or failure to start passing yellow stools by the fourth day of life, indicate that a baby may not be getting enough milk. In addition to moving his bowels, a well-nourished, breastfed newborn can be expected to wet his diaper after each feeding. The urine should be clear, not dark. Your baby should nurse 8 to 12 times in a 24-hour period with 10 to 15 minutes of active suckling per breast at each feeding. A newborn who has obtained adequate milk will usually fall asleep contentedly after nursing, while an underfed infant may act fussy, suck on his hands, and frequently require a pacifier. OK to Supplement? Q. My baby was born a few weeks early and had a lot of trouble latching on to nurse during the first week. Now, at 3 weeks of age, she is still below her birth weight, and her doctor is insisting that I should start supplementing her with formula. I am hesitant to do so, however, as I am afraid that this will prevent her from ever breastfeeding successfully. Is there any other way to get breastfeeding on track after such a poor start? A.  In my opinion, your breastfeeding problems are not likely to self-correct with perseverance alone. Because of your baby's relatively small size, preterm birth, and poor nursing, I suspect that your milk supply has steadily decreased over the past three weeks. Your underweight baby cannot be expected to build it up on her own. I recommend you immediately focus on making sure your baby receives adequate nutrition and on increasing your milk production. Once these goals have been accomplished, you have a good chance of returning to full breastfeeding. First, breastfeed your baby approximately every 3 hours, for 5 to 10 minutes per breast. Then offer her as much formula as is necessary to satisfy her appetite. In addition, you should use a breast pump (preferably a fully automatic electric pump) for 10 to 15 minutes immediately after nursing your baby. The pump will remove any milk your baby was unable to take and provide an effective stimulus to maximize your milk production. The residual high-fat hindmilk you obtain with the pump can be used to supplement your baby at the next feeding. Your spouse or a friend can give your baby her supplemental milk while you use the pump so as to shorten this triple-feeding process. As your milk supply increases and your baby's nutritional status improves, she will obtain more milk by breastfeeding and require less supplemental formula. As you return to full breastfeeding, wean your child from formula before you end your pumping regimen. Too Much of a Good Thing Q. I am breastfeeding my 6-week-old daughter, and my milk production seems out of control. I leak onto my bed at night and soak through my blouse during the day. My baby gulps and sputters her way through her feedings, and sometimes cries in frustration. What do you recommend? A.  I agree that an overabundant milk supply can be a mixed blessing. While it's nice to know that your baby is getting plenty of milk, leaking is inconvenient, overly full breasts are prone to mastitis, and your baby can feel like she is drinking from a fire hydrant. Try nursing your baby from one breast at each feeding. She should be better able to control the flow of milk as the initial spraying subsides. A few hours later, you can nurse her from the opposite side. (At first, it may be necessary to pump some of the excess milk from the unsuckled breast to prevent engorgement.) Your baby may also find it easier to nurse if you are leaning back in a recliner, so that the top of her head is slightly above the top of your breast. Fortunately, leaking tends to diminish after 6 to 8 weeks, when the capacity of your milk ducts increases to better contain the milk released during let-down. I predict your supply will gradually come to match your baby's demand as she gets bigger. Meanwhile, wear breast pads to help deal with the hassles of leaking. Breastfeeding After Surgery Q. I had breast-reduction surgery a few years before I got pregnant, and I was advised that the procedure could interfere with breastfeeding. Is this true? A.  Although little scientific research is available on this topic, practitioners who work with nursing mothers agree that breast-reduction surgery poses a risk to successful breastfeeding. While it is remotely possible that you will be able to provide all the milk your baby requires, it is more likely that your infant will need to drink some supplemental formula in addition to the milk he obtains from you. Although many techniques can be used to perform a breast reduction, the procedure usually requires a surgical incision around the areola, which can cut milk ducts. Disruption of these ducts will partially prevent milk from flowing to the nipple openings. Although you can still breastfeed your baby, your infant's weight will need to be closely monitored after birth. Your baby's doctor or a lactation consultant can determine how much milk he takes from each breast at a typical feeding by weighing your baby in the same clothes before and after breastfeeding. I also encourage you to use a breast pump after most feedings for at least the first week of your baby's life to help maximize your milk production. Even if you need to supplement with formula, your baby will enjoy the pleasures of ""comfort nursing."" Your breasts represent far more than nutrition to your infant. Breastfeeding provides security, physical intimacy, and skin-to-skin contact-- it certainly doesn't have to be exclusive to be of significant value to you and your baby. Tainted Milk? Q. I am struggling with postpartum depression, and my doctor thinks medication would help. Can these types of drugs harm my breastfeeding baby? A.  You are certainly not alone in your struggles with depression; it's the most common psychiatric illness in new mothers. I believe that you will be a happier, more effective mother if you receive treatment. Your baby is likely to benefit as well, since depressed mothers are usually less able to meet their children's needs. While virtually all drugs taken by a nursing mother appear in her breastmilk to some degree, these minimal amounts usually pose no risk to a nursing infant. (Premature or sick newborns may be more vulnerable to the effects of drugs than older, healthier infants.) For this reason, very few medications are actually restricted for breastfeeding mothers. Those that are include cancer chemotherapy agents, drugs that suppress the immune system, and all illicit drugs. While little specific information is available about the safety of commonly prescribed antidepressants during breastfeeding, several studies show that a number of drugs have no adverse effects on nursing infants. Among the newer medications, Zoloft seems to be one of the safest, because very little drug enters the breastmilk, and none has been detected in breastfeeding babies whose mothers had taken the drug. Although many nursing mothers have taken Prozac, it has been found in some infants, and reports have suggested it may cause infant colic, sedation, or insomnia. Whatever medication your doctor prescribes, inquire about its safety during breastfeeding, inform your baby's pediatrician that you are taking the drug, and watch your infant closely for possible side effects. On Strike Q. I was hoping to breastfeed my baby for at least one year, but she is only 7 months old and is starting to refuse to nurse. She drinks bottles of my expressed milk (plus some formula) while I am at work, but when I try to nurse her at home in the evening, she pulls away and cries. I'm definitely not ready to wean, so what should I do? A.  It sounds like your baby is showing signs of a ""nursing strike,"" which is a sudden refusal to breastfeed. This problem is often seen in babies like yours who have been receiving bottles and may have developed a preference for the ease of bottlefeeding, although many babies have no problem with a breast/bottle combination. I find that a nursing strike is often related to a low milk supply. Since your baby is receiving formula while you are at work, I suspect that you are no longer pumping all the milk your baby needs. Because she gets milk easily from the bottle, your baby may find breastfeeding to be frustrating, especially in the evenings when your supply is typically lower. One of the best ways to get her breastfeeding again is to offer your breast while she is drowsy or asleep. Most babies will automatically breastfeed in their sleep, and many will continue to nurse without protest when they awaken. Never try to force your baby to latch on, however, as this may only increase her aversion to breastfeeding. In the evenings, try to offer your breast before your baby becomes frantically hungry. If she seems frustrated by the rate of milk flow, you may need to give her a little formula to take the edge off of her appetite before she can enjoy the comfort and security of nursing. Whenever she does not breastfeed well, use your breast pump to express your milk in order to keep your supply up."
 New-Mom Energy Boosters,http://www.parenting.com/article/new-mom-energy-boosters,"If you thought pregnancy was tiring, life with a newborn probably has you feeling pooped. Here, seven pick-me-ups to  help  keep you going. 1. Drink up  Dehydration can make you feel sluggish, so try to drink eight to twelve glasses of fluids a day. ""Breastfeeding mothers produce about three-quarters to one quart of milk a day, so that's about how much extra liquid they need,"" says Cheryl Lovelady, Ph.D., R.D., an associate professor of nutrition at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. 2. Take a power nap  A 20-minute nap may not make up for the hours of sleep you're missing at night, but clocking short bouts of shut-eye can help you rest your eyes and recharge your brain, says Rebecca Huntley, author of  The Sleep Book for Tired Parents . 3. Get your heart pumping  ""The best energy booster we've found is regular aerobic exercise,"" says Lovelady, who recently headed up a study on postpartum weight loss. The program that new moms found most energizing included a five-minute warm-up walk, followed by five minutes of brisk walking at 60 percent of maximum heart rate (220 minus age), then a five-minute cooldown walk. Every day the moms added two more minutes of brisk walking until they had worked up to 45 minutes each day. Don't have a big chunk of time to devote to sweat? Buy a workout tape and break it up into 15-minute bits throughout the day. 4. Eat  You may feel too busy to eat a full meal, but the best way to keep blood sugar steady-- and energy high-- is to eat three square meals with a snack every two to three hours if you need it. Power-packed snacks include low-fat cheese with wheat crackers or a cup of yogurt with a banana. Eating too little can sap energy. And fatigue may interfere with the production of oxytocin, the hormone necessary for milk to let down, says Lovelady. 5. Breathe  Try this yoga breathing exercise to energize your mind: Close your right nostril with your thumb; inhale slowly through your left. Now close your left nostril with your ring finger and pinkie, open the right, and exhale slowly through your right nostril. Inhale through your right nostril, close the right, then exhale through your left. Repeat 5 to 10 times.v 6. Supplement  After giving birth, be sure your body isn't low on essential nutrients, especially if you're breastfeeding. ""I usually recommend that women continue to take their prenatal vitamin,"" says Glade Curtis, M.D., coauthor of  Bouncing Back After Your Pregnancy . 7. Wind down  The flip side of invigorating yourself is knowing how to unwind so you can sleep soundly. Sip on a cup of warm milk or chamomile tea before bedtime, suggests Huntley: ""The ritual itself can be just as helpful as the contents of the cup."""
 Family Money Makeovers,http://www.parenting.com/article/family-money-makeovers,"Struggling to Live Well Name:  Rachel and John Quinn Child:  Jailyn, 10 months Jobs:  She's a nurse;he's an education enrollment coordinator Income:  $58,000 a year Rachel and John Quinn have the same seemingly modest goals of many new parents: They'd like to have more children someday and move their expanding family into their own home. Yet with big school loans ($35,000 total), two car payments ($700 a month combined), and about $7,000 in credit card debt, they find it hard to live within their means each month, let alone save for the future. ""We both have pretty good jobs, work hard, and don't spend extravagantly, so we shouldn't be struggling so much,"" says Rachel of their paycheck-to-paycheck existence. ""There's got to be a better way."" They almost never go out, she saysthey stay home at night, playing with the baby and getting in a few rounds of cards or video games. Both fitness buffs, they can't afford gym memberships. ""We're only 24 and 25 years old,"" she says wistfully. ""It would be nice to have a little fun sometimes."" John doesn't consider his current job  soliciting students for online college courses  a career but is unsure about what his next move should be. His college degree is in computer information systems with a minor in business. The Quinns currently rent one half of a two-family house. They coordinate their work schedules so they don't have to put Jailyn in daycare  Rachel works weekends, John works weekdays. The baby was born two-and-a-half months prematurely and nearly died, and as a result the couple prefers to look after Jailyn themselves. ""She's our little miracle,"" says Rachel. ""We came too close to losing her to leave her with anyone else just yet."" Takingcharge of their finances Drive down car payments. Financial planners tend to think car payments should be no more than 5 percent of a family's pretax income, but the Quinns spend nearly three times that amount for their 2002 Nissan Altima and 2002 Buick Rendezvous, which they bought used. To lower those payments, Kevin McKinley, a certified financial planner in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, and author of  Make Your Kid a Millionaire: 11 Easy Ways Anyone Can Secure a Child's Financial Future , recommends selling one of the cars and replacing it with an older used car purchased outright for no more than $2,000. The rest of the proceeds from the sale can be used to help pay down credit card debt and start a fund for the down payment on a house. Tackle the credit card debt in other ways, too. The Quinns should then dedicate some of the money they save in car payments to pay off their credit cards at a faster rate, says Ginita Wall, certified financial planner in San Diego, author of  It's More than Money  It's Your Life!  and cofounder of the  Women's Institute for Financial Education . They should start with the highest-rate cards first  in their case, a department store card that charges a whopping 24 percent, on which they owe $400. If they increase their current $50-a-month payments on the card by $75, they'll pay it off in about three months, versus nine months, says Wall. If they then apply that same $75 a month to their next high-rate card, a 14 percent account with a $1,000 balance, they'll pay it off in six months rather than nine. Once they've paid off the credit cards, they can start building a house fund. Look for everyday economies. The Quinns spend $80 a month for their home phone and $150 a month for their cells. Getting rid of one or the other or switching to a lower-cost cell service could free up cash for the ""little fun"" that they'd like to be able to enjoy. Consult a career counselor. To explore job opportunities that would make better use of his education  and perhaps offer a bigger salary and better benefits, like a 401(k) or similar retirement savings program  John should consider talking to a career counselor, says Wall. Local community colleges often offer low-cost counseling programs. Buy life insurance. If something were to happen to either of them, the family would go into a financial and an emotional free fall. Since both are young and healthy, they can pick up the protection they need at a relatively cheap price. McKinley recommends they each buy a $500,000, 20-year term-life insurance policy, which would see their daughter through to adulthood. They can get quotes online at such websites as  www.term4sale.com  and  www.insure.com . Dealt a Tough Hand Name:  Anna Mills Child:  Marshall, age 2 Job:  Part-time preschool teacher Income:  $23,500 a year Former first-grade teacher Anna Mills quit her job shortly after her son, Marshall, was born two years ago and relished her role as a stay-at-home mom  until quite suddenly the marriage she thought was stable started to disintegrate. Within the space of only a few months, the marriage had ended. She knew she couldn't count on more than modest financial help from her ex-husband, a high school teacher. So she went back to work as a preschool teacher at a local church, a part-time position that allows her as much time as possible with her son, a happy and energetic toddler who loves music and sometimes laughs so hard he can barely catch his breath. She currently earns $8,000 a year and half tuition for Marshall. Her ex-husband pays $450 a month in child support, while both his parents and hers help out with an additional $700 a month. Still, with just $23,500 a year in income, she finds meeting day-to-day expenses a struggle. She has no savings or emergency fund and worries that any unexpected expense could send her fragile budget into a tailspin. ""If the tires blow on my car, I wouldn't be able to replace them,"" she says. The 10-year-old car has 128,000 miles on it. Why not just charge them? Mills was recently the victim of identity theft and has spent several months trying to correct her credit record, but until the case is resolved, she can't obtain credit and has no credit cards that she could tap in a financial emergency. To supplement her income, she's trying to launch a modest crafts business on the web. (She makes memory boxes, which she currently sells to friends and family, earning her an extra $100 or so a month.) Also on the bright side, she just moved into a new three-bedroom house with financial help from her parents, who covered the down payment. She's extremely grateful for their support  ""I don't know what I'd do without it""  but feels uncomfortable accepting so much assistance. ""At some point, I'll need to stand on my own financial feet,"" she says. Getting Back on Track Build an emergency fund. With no short-term savings and just $200 in her checking account, she rightly worries about how she'd come up with cash in a crisis. Fortunately, she has some recourse: 57 shares of stock that were a gift from her father. Selling it all now would yield about $2,500, which she can put in a money-market account to use if and when needed, says McKinley. Mills can further prepare for a crunch by opening a home equity line of credit. In her case this would give her up to $17,000 to tap in an emergency, but she won't pay any interest or fees unless she actually needs money and draws on the credit line. Rebuild her credit standing. She must continue to check her credit reports regularly to make sure the errors have been corrected. One way she can start to rebuild a good record, McKinley suggests, is to get a debit card tied to her checking account that she can use to pay for things here and there to demonstrate that she can use plastic responsibly. She might also look into getting a secured credit card, linked to her new money-market account  banks are more likely to issue credit if the debt is secured by a tangible asset, like a linked account. Get tax help. Her low income means she may be able to wipe out any federal taxes she owes by claiming the Earned Income Tax Credit, says McKinley. This reduction was available to qualifying families and individuals with incomes under $33,692 for 2004. (For more information, go to  www.irs.gov .) Keep growing her entrepreneurial spirit. Both planners encourage her to stick with her efforts to build her memory-box hobby into an online business to earn extra cash. The cost of the marketing effort is minimal, and the potential payoff in added income is much needed. Once Marshall is a little older and in school for longer periods, Mills might also consider looking for a higher-paying teaching job or perhaps start tutoring students as a sideline to bring in extra money. Focus long-term on retirement. Given their financial situation, Marshall is likely to qualify for scholarships and low-cost loans for college, so both planners urge Mills to put away any money she's able to save for her own retirement. Even little bits help over many years: $25 a month, earning 8 percent in a tax-deferred account like an IRA, will grow to nearly $60,000 by the time Mills turns 65. Stretching One Income Name:  Brandi and Jason Grant Children:  Randee, 7, Kelsey, 3, and Aaron, 1 Jobs:  She's a stay-at-home mom and he's an Air Force staff sergeant Income:  $24,000, plus housing allowance This family of five is struggling to get by on a single military salary. ""By the end of the month, we run out of money and start charging the things we need, like food and diapers,"" says Brandi. ""I know we could  we have to  do better."" The Grants are hardly big spenders. Their only real indulgence is going out for fast food a couple of times a week with the kids. Yet they're close to maxing out their two credit cards, and can only make the minimum payments on their nearly $6,000 combined balance. To help out, Brandi's mom regularly buys clothes for them and the children, but the couple realizes this isn't a long-term solution. Says Brandi, ""We couldn't afford it without my mom, but we can't go on relying on her."" Jason, currently stationed at Albuquerque's Kirtland Air Force Base, is planning on a military career. The couple expect to stay in base housing until he retires from the military, which means they won't be looking to buy a home for 20 years or so. Their current home, a four-bedroom house on base, which comes rent-free with utilities, is not luxurious but is certainly adequate for the family's needs. But while the Grants won't have to worry about housing for a while, they're concerned about their ability to pay for virtually everything else, from mundane expenses like curtains (most of their windows are bare) to unforeseen emergency expenses. This was underscored last year when Jason's grandmother was ill and the couple couldn't afford to travel one state away to see her. ""We rack our brains over our finances every single pay period,"" says Brandi, ""but we feel like we're just stuck."" Make Their Money Go Further Refinance high-rate loans. With the average rate on new car loans recently below 7 percent, the Grants should thoroughly investigate whether they can do better than the 11.25 percent rate they're currently paying for the loan on their $22,000 Dodge Caravan, says McKinley. If they are able to refinance their loan, this move alone could free up more than $50 a month. Track spending. They should write down every penny they spend for the next month or so to get a handle on how the small expenses add up, says McKinley. For instance, Brandi estimates that the family spends about $175 a month eating out twice a week. It's tough to make sacrifices, but if they can cut these meals to once a week, they'll save roughly $90 a month. Consider ways to supplement income. The Grants currently tithe $200 a month to their church. If this is something they feel strongly they must continue, they ought to figure out how to boost their income by that much. Wall suggests Brandi investigate doing some work directly for the church and then tithing her earnings right back to it. Redirect savings. The Grants should use the extra few hundred dollars a month these moves will free up to aggressively pay down their credit card debt, says Wall. Then they can apply that same money to longer-term savings goals, like setting up an emergency fund, college savings, and an IRA for Brandi (Jason will receive a military pension, so saving for his retirement is less urgent). Write a will. Every parent needs to write a will that names a guardian for their children and details how they want their assets bequeathed if either or both were to die prematurely. (Simple wills can be drawn up using computer software programs for less than $50; lawyers typically charge at least several hundred dollars.) ""Disregarding the potential for tragedy, which is easy to do when you're young, doesn't make tragedy less likely to happen, but it does ensure that your family's pain would be financial as well as emotional,"" says McKinley. ""Taking measures that will protect the people you love is a tremendous gift to give them."""
 12 Fun Baby Learning Games,http://www.parenting.com/article/baby-learning-activities,"Yes, we're grateful for healthy, happy babies. But don't we all want our kids to be brilliant too? I do. I'm not talking about the level of genius that lands national talk-show appearances or gains early admission to Harvard. I'd just like my boys to be blessed with brains that let them breeze easily through life: little struggle, lots of opportunity. As it turns out, we parents have a hand in making that happen  and not just in the genes we pass along. Science clearly shows that baby's brain development depends, largely, on his early experiences and not experiences with fancy DVDs or brain-enhancing toys.  You are the best toy in the room, says Gina Lebedeva Ph.D., director of translation, out-reach and education at the University of Washington's Institute for Learning & Brain Sciences. Our brains have evolved to learn from other brains. Simply engaging with baby in positive, everyday ways helps her build the trillions (yes, trillions!) of brain connections that lead to language development, problem-solving skills and the emotional IQ that's so important for getting along  and ahead!  in the world. But if it feels like school, you're trying too hard. The key is to have fun with your little one as you help her to see  and hear, smell, feel and taste  how incredibly interesting everything around her is. Try these 12 easy and fun baby learning activities you can use on the go and during snacktime or playtime. When you're out and about Play tour guide Narrating your day helps baby pair words with what he's seeing, says Kathy Gruhn, a speech-language pathologist and author of My Baby Compass . Speak slowly, simply and in that higher-pitched child-directed speech that slips out naturally (research shows it enhances baby's learning). Feel ridiculous talking to yourself? Don't, because you're not. Months before they talk, babies understand much of what you're saying and may even start making incredible connections. Take it from Hillary Homzie, a mother of three boys in Napa, California. When my oldest was 6 months old, I got a job writing a travel book on Philadelphia and took my son on my trips  to the aquarium, the insect museum, the Italian market, says Homzie. I narrated everything. At 14 months, he pointed to pasta at a farmer's market and said money noodles. I realized I'd told him about penne: penny money. Help him take it all in If you're on a walk and hear a dog, ask your baby, What do you hear? suggests Gruhn. Then give the answer: Dog. Bark. Ruff! Ruff! Do this every time you encounter a barking dog and your child will probably start answering with the sound (Ruff! Ruff!), says Gruhn. Eventually, he'll refine his response to dog. Try a similar approach to teach him about physical sensations. If it starts drizzling while you're out, before you run for cover, let him experience the mist on his face. He won't melt. Say, Feel the rain. Rain. Wet. Then cover the stroller and hustle home. Be polite and engaging Smiling and waving to the man bagging your groceries not only teaches baby cause and effect (he smiles and waves back), it also helps develop baby's social IQ. Children watch you for cues on how to interpret a situation, says Claire Lerner, director of parenting resources for Zero to Three, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit that promotes the health and development of infants and toddlers. Waving and smiling are friendly things you do when you see someone you like. You don't have to parade around town like a politician, just remember that your little one is watching and learning from every interaction. Keep some things constant Babies' brains process new information most efficiently when they're in familiar surroundings, says Lebedeva. Then, the brain can go into autopilot and take in only the new details, she says. Try variations on common themes. For instance, go for a walk every day at the same time but switch up your route. There is a predictability in our near-daily walk that is very reassuring to my son, says Meg McElwee, mother of two in Durham, North Carolina. He delights in seeing the neighborhood cats. It must be fascinating for a baby to realize that there are so many different cats, to begin to understand cat' as a category. At Snacktime Initiate a two-way conversation Giving your child a chance to respond  even with a smile  is important. What a child gets from that, says Lebedeva, is Wow, what I have to say is important. It also teaches the concept of give-and-take. Reinforce the idea of reciprocity by playing back-and-forth with a spoon or cup: You ask for it by name, she gives it you, you thank her and give it back. Supplement with signs Sign language offers a visual cue (concrete) to spoken word (abstract). Plus, There are about 80 muscles in the mouth and face that need to develop before you can speak, says Gruhn. It takes at least a year for those muscles to develop, whereas the muscles needed to make a simple sign develop pretty quickly. At 1 year, my son can't say milk, but he can sign it and point to his cup. When I sign and say milk back then give him the cup filled with it, he laughs and claps, clearly psyched to have gotten his point across. Other useful signs to try: please, thank you, more, all done. Learn these simple signs and others at babysignlanguage.com . Incorporate counting As early as 4 1/2 months, babies have a number sense that allows them to notice changes in the number of objects in front of them, according to research out of Harvard University. Count out Cheerios or peas as you place them in a line on his tray. As he nears 2, show him how to categorize food by color. When her children were about that age, Donna Kaplan, a mother of three in Albuquerque, New Mexico, started showing her children how to sort a small handful of M&Ms. If you keep candy off-limits, try this with colored Goldfish crackers. Let her finger-paint with yogurt When she tosses her cup to the floor, say, Oops, you threw it down , and, as you lift it, say, So we have to pick it up . Getting messy and tossing things around is how babies learn. You're looking at a little scientist, says Lebedeva. Scientists ask, What will happen if  ? Your little one isn't just testing what will to happen to the beans when she bombs them to the floor but also how you'll react. Before you correct her, ask yourself: Is this rule (such as no playing with your food) really necessary? Research shows when parents say things like don't or no, baby's language is slower to develop because these commands inhibit exploration, says Lebedeva. During playtime Hands on, hands off Show him how a toy works, then back off. When you see your child struggling, resist the urge to fix the situation, says Mendel Klein, a pediatric occupational therapist in New York City and father of a preschooler. Eventually, he'll figure out that the cup is smaller than the pot. He'll also learn that, with effort, he can solve problems. If he's really frustrated, offer emotional support, suggests Lerner. Acknowledge that it's hard, applaud his effort then help guide him to a solution. Expand your idea of educational toys and games Yes, shape sorters teach spatial reasoning and problem-solving; so does letting him figure out how to retrieve the ball that rolled under the couch. You don't need to buy brain-boosting toys, says Lerner. Maria Brown of Washington, D.C., knows this well, as her 14-month-old's favorite toys are wooden clothespins and a empty tissue box. He puts the pins in the box and the plastic insert at the top prevents them from falling out, says Brown. Sometimes he reaches in and pulls the clothespins back out. Other times, he picks up the box and shakes away  a homemade maraca! Turn on the tunes Some research suggests that, from birth, babies respond to the rhythm and tempo of music and may even find it more engaging than speech. I love to sing and dance while holding [my 1-year-old daughter], says Jill Neville of Millersburg, Ohio. Her giggles are priceless, and seeing her start shaking her head or wiggling to the rhythms cracks us up. The sheer joy of singing and dancing together is what makes these activities so magical for brain development, says Lebedeva. Have fun With all of the focus on brain development, some parents have turned play into an academic exercise, says Lerner. They're so goal-driven that they don't enjoy it. Kids pick up on this. It's stressful for everyone, and it squashes the curiosity and confidence-building crucial to learning. Let baby take the lead during playtime. If he's bored with books but obsessed with the dog's water, give him his own bowl and let him splash outside on the deck. Play should be totally pleasurable, says Lerner.

 Kids Health QA: Health Boosters for Babies,http://www.parenting.com/article/health-boosters-for-babies,"Q:  Are  baby  products with supplements like DHA and probiotics worth buying? A: Well, it depends on which supplement we're talking about. DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is a fatty acid that's important for baby brain and eye development (and long-term adult heart health), which is why it's crucial that you both get enough. If you breastfeed -- the best way for infants to get DHA -- and take a supplement yourself (doctors recommend 200 milligrams a day), your baby is most likely getting all she needs. Nursing moms who want to get DHA from food can opt for fish, while women who bottle-feed can use a fortified formula. As for probiotics, they're healthy bacteria similar to those found in the intestines. Most babies have plenty of the digestion-aiding bugs in their bellies and don't need supplementation. That said, I've had success treating both diarrhea and constipation with probiotics, especially those found in many yogurts (look for ""active cultures""). If your baby develops one of these problems, ask your doctor whether using yogurt or probiotic capsules might help."

 Calcium: It Does a Baby Good,http://www.parenting.com/article/calcium-it-does-a-baby-good,"Think you're milking your food for maximum  calcium  potential? You may not be, say experts. The majority of pregnant women don't take in nearly enough calcium: It's recommended that you get 1,200 mg a day when you're expecting. Although that equals about four glasses of milk, women who can't stomach that much dairy may feel that goal is out of reach. But make no bones about it: Increasing your calcium intake is just as important for your developing baby's health as it is for yours. A recent study conducted by researchers at the University of Tennessee, Memphis, showed that babies whose moms consumed less than 600 mg of calcium a day during pregnancy had 15 percent lower bone density than babies whose moms got up to 2,000 mg of calcium a day by taking calcium supplements during pregnancy. ""The old teaching was that babies will get what they need, even if (the mother doesn't), but this suggests that that's not true,"" says John Repke, M.D., chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Nebraska Medical Center. There are many different supplements available on drugstore shelves. What distinguishes each is its content: the amount of elemental calcium combined with an ingredient that eases its absorption into your body. Choose your supplement carefully: A new study shows that the body may actually be able to access more of the mineral when it's in the form of calcium citrate, despite the fact that carbonate supplements are higher in elemental calcium. Translation: More isn't always better, especially if you can't use it."
 Post-Baby Power Foods,http://www.parenting.com/article/post-baby-power-foods,"As a new mom, you've got different dietary needs, says Rachel Brandeis, R.D., spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association.

 Prenatal Care Linked to Toddler Cavities,http://www.parenting.com/pregnancy/nutrition/prenatal-care-linked-to-toddler-cavities,"Prenatal care can range from blood tests to exercise, but in light of a  new study published in the medical journal Pediatrics , perhaps it should also include more vitamin D to reduce the chance of tooth cavities when the baby becomes a toddler. Because tooth enamel begins developing in the womb, researchers looked at vitamin D levels in more than 200 pregnant women from an economically disadvantaged urban area and compared them to the number of cavities that their children had when they became toddlers. Researchers analyzed the women's vitamin D levels during their second or third trimesters of pregnancy. When the babies turned about 16 months old, the researchers revisited the toddlers to examine their teeth. The toddlers whose mothers had low prenatal vitamin D levels had  more cavities . After the release of this study, you might think that doctors will recommend vitamin D supplements more often during prenatal care, but it's too early to tell.  Doctors generally have been split  on taking vitamin D pills during pregnancy. Some doctors believe vitamin D supplements should be recommended to expecting mothers and their levels should be tested during pregnancy. But others shy away from recommending additional supplements during pregnancy, instead choosing to encourage mothers to stimulate vitamin D production naturally by spending more time in the sun and eating certain foods, such as mushrooms and eggs. Either way, talk to your OB/GYN about this new study to see how it might affect you and your unborn child. Perhaps a few extra supplements during pregnancy could keep your child away from  the dentist's drill  a bit longer."
 The Benefits of Fish Oil,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-benefits-of-fish-oil,"Study after study has shown the benefits of fish oil for  pregnant  and nursing moms and their babies. The supplements -- full of brain-building fatty acids like DHA -- may improve young children's hand-eye coordination and boost adult memory function, visual acuity, and mood. So which brand is best? Luckily, researchers say most contain the recommended dose of DHA (300 milligrams) and are free of toxins like mercury. To be sure your supplement adheres to these standards, scan the online list at  OceansAlive.org . Then let cost and convenience be your guide: Look for a brand that delivers the full 300 mg in just a few capsules. Also keep in mind that fish-oil capsules may disrupt your digestion. Freeze them before swallowing, or take them with meals or at bedtime, if you experience any gas, bloating, or fishy burps."
 Your Vitamin D Treatment for S.A.D. Might Also Help You Conceive,http://www.parenting.com/article/your-vitamin-d-treatment-sad-might-also-help-you-conceive,"Back when I was trying to get pregnant with my first child, I didn't always pay attention to my nutrition. In fact, I wasn't even aware that taking supplemental vitamins before pregnancy was a thing! However, I was aware of that pesky little depression that would take over every so often, especially during the cloudy, cold months of winter. Then it hit me: what if my Seasonal Affective Disorder and fertility issues were related? I asked my OB/GYNif she couldcheck my bloodworkagain to see if I had any vitamin deficiencies, and sure enough, my vitamin D levels were too low. She suggested that I take a high-quality vitamin D supplement regularly, and after only a few months of taking it, I felt happier, healthier and even became pregnant! Obviously, not everyone will magically conceive simply by taking extra vitamin D, but if you have a deficiency, it might just help. The Research Vitamin Dhelps beat the rainy day blues of Seasonal Affective Disorder by improving how well your body holds on to its stores of serotonin,the ""good mood""hormone, but it could also hold the key for many women with fertility issues. In a study conducted by The University of North Carolina ,supplemental vitamin D was shown to improve both mental functioning and reproduction. This study claims that without sufficient levels of vitamin D in the body, reproductive tissues were negatively effected and did not function at optimum levels. If you know that youalready sufferfrom Seasonal Affective Disorder, consider looking more closely at your diet and bloodwork beforespending a fortune on unnecessary fertility testing. Sources of Vitamin D Many women begin by taking the average daily requirement of 600 unitsof vitamin D, which you can likely find in a daily multivitamin. Supplementation for Seasonal Affective Disorder and fertility issues may require a slightly higher dose. However, before you start taking any vitamin supplement, especially vitamin D, always talk to your doctor first.She can let you know exactly how much vitamin D you should take for your specific condition.Certain people should not supplement with extra vitamin D, such as people who have kidney disease, lymphoma or atherosclerosis. Pregnant or lactating women should make sure to keep vitamin D levels below 4000 units per day. However, you can start including more foods high in vitamin D into your diet! Our favorite vitamin D heavy foods include: Oily Fish:Look for fish high in omega 3 fatty acids, yet low in mercury content, like sardines, wild-caughtsalmon and white albacore tuna. A 4-ounce serving of wild-caught salmon will provide you with more than 120 percent of the average daily requirement of vitamin D. Dairy:If youlike drinking milk, either on its own or overcereal, you will love knowing that an 8-ounce glass of milk containsmore than 15 percentof the vitamin D you will need in one day. Eggs:Want to add more vitamin D into your diet? Try whipping up a breakfast omelet! Just one large egg contains more than 10 percent of your daily vitamin D requirements. Mushrooms:Toss a few button mushroomsinto your pasta or soup and add in a little more vitamin D! A half cup of mushrooms will provide you with more than 5 percent of the vitamin D you need. Remember, always check with your general doctor or OB/GYN before taking supplemental vitamin D. If it turns out that you need the extra supplementation, it might just help youto conceive.

 A Booster For Baby Bones,http://www.parenting.com/article/a-booster-for-baby-bones,"Public health officials are increasingly concerned about continuing reports of infants who've developed rickets, a bone-softening disease that's caused by inadequate  vitamin  D intake and limited exposure to sunlight, which helps the body produce the vitamin. Babies with darker skin are particularly at risk because their skin pigments reduce sunlight penetration. Though formulas contain vitamin D, a formula-fed baby could develop a deficiency if he's not drinking at least 17 ounces each day. Breastfed infants are also at risk because human milk contains only small amounts of the vitamin. To prevent rickets, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recently recommended giving all infants a supplement of vitamin D. Here's how to keep your baby healthy. Start supplementing before your baby is 2 months old.  Begin by giving him at least 200 international units (IU) of vitamin D each day. Your pediatrician can help you determine the right time to begin supplementation; some nursing babies may need a month or two to adjust to breastfeeding before learning to accept a dropper. (A formula-fed baby only needs a supplement if he's not drinking 17 ounces a day by 2 months.) Though 200 IU per day is the recommended amount, vitamin D is currently only available in multivitamin drops that contain 400 IU of vitamin D per milliliter. Rest assured, there is no harm in giving 400 IU per day. Avoid direct sun exposure.  Even though sunlight can boost your baby's vitamin D intake, it's important that you protect her skin from ultraviolet light. There's evidence now suggesting that the younger the age at which a child is first exposed to direct sunlight, the greater the risk of developing skin cancer later in life. The AAP recommends that infants younger than 6 months be kept out of direct sunlight and that older babies be protected with clothing and sunscreen."
 How to Pick a Multivitamin,http://www.parenting.com/article/how-to-pick-a-multivitamin,"Pills are no substitute for a healthy lifestyle, but they can supplement your diet and protect against nutritional shortcomings. Yet more isn't always  better . If you're expecting, you're likely already taking a prenatal vitamin. If you're not, here's what to look for in a multi, according to Meir Stampfer, M.D., professor of nutrition at Harvard School of Public Health:  Vitamin A Be sure most is from beta-carotene, which your body converts to A as needed. Too much preformed A (retinol) can weaken bones and ups the risk of birth defects. The Daily Value (DV) is 5,000 international units; up to 10,000 a day seems safe. If you eat lots of A-fortified foods, skip a multi with retinol.  Folic acid Look for at least 400 micrograms. If you get pregnant, the risk of your baby having a spinal-cord defect will be reduced.  Vitamins D, K, and B6 Many women get less than the recommended amounts. D and K are key for strong bones; B6 helps protect the heart.  Calcium You won't get 100 percent of the DV (1,000 milli-grams) in a multi-- it's too bulky. So if you don't eat calcium-rich foods like milk and yogurt, take a separate supplement.  Iron If you're like most women, your diet's low in this mineral, so a multi can help you get more. But don't take a separate iron supplement unless you're diagnosed with a deficiency-- the body can't get rid of excess iron.  Just enough A daily supplement shouldn't exceed 100 percent of the DV for anything. To be sure, check the percentages on the label."
 Tea: When to Avoid Green,http://www.parenting.com/article/tea-when-to-avoid-green,"Despite the health benefits of green tea (scientists think it may protect against cancer), it's best to skip it if you're trying to conceive. It decreases the effectiveness of folic acid, which is vital for preventing neural tube defects in the first month after conception. The effect is small if you continue to eat folate-rich greens and take a folic-acid supplement, but why take a chance? After the first trimester, up to a cup a day is fine."
 Study: Iron Decreases Behavior Problems in Low Birth Weight Babies,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/stephanie-parenting/study-iron-decreases-behavior-problems-low-birth-weight-babi,"You know getting enough iron is important to your childs physical healthtoo little causes fatigue and reduces immunitybut theres increasing evidence that iron deficiency impacts behavior and development, too, especially for the most vulnerable newborns. A Swedish study  just released online  by the journal  Pediatrics  found that when given iron supplements from six weeks to six months of age, low birth weight babies (defined as weighing less than 5.5 pounds) were significantly less likely to have developmental behavior problems like ADHD at age 3 . According to the researchers, the low birth weight infants who did not receive the iron supplements were 4.5 times more likely to experience behavior problems, than low birth weight babies given 1 or 2 mg supplements. In a control group of normal weight infants, 3.2% showed signs of behavioral problems. Plus: Superfoods for Kids This study certainly supports iron supplementation as a simple, low-risk, and low-cost way to improve the lives of babies who have already been shown to be at higher risk for cognitive and developmental problems. But theres another super-easy way to ensure that all newborns have adequate iron stores:  Parenting  contributing editor Alan Greene, M.D., calls it Ticc Tocc, which stands for Transitioning Immediate Cord Clamping to Optimal Cord Clamping. By delaying clamping of the umbilical cord in the delivery room by a mere 90 seconds, allowing more iron-rich, oxygen-rich, stem-cell-rich fetal blood to be pumped into the newborn, the risk of iron deficiency is significantly reduced. Listen to  Dr. Greene explain the urgent need for optimal cord clamping  at TEDxBrussels last month. And ask your obstetrician or midwife about it if youll be giving birth soon.

 Can DHEA Help You Get Pregnant?,http://www.parenting.com/article/can-dhea-help-you-get-pregnant,"If you've been having a hard time getting pregnant and are scouring the Internet for something that may help, you probably have read about the supplement DHEA. The jury is still out on whether this supplement can actually help women get pregnant, but it has been associated with preparing the body for in vitro fertilization and boosting low ovarian reserves. Before you pick up a bottle at the store, however, it is important that you understand what this hormone is and how it might affect your body. DHEA, or dehydroepiandrosterone, is a hormone that is made naturally in the body. We make it in our adrenal glands and our brain. According to the Mayo Clinic , DHEA leads to the production of estrogen in women. After age 30, DHEA levels in the body begin to decrease, which can lead to fertility issues, such as low libido and decreased egg quality. While this hormone has strong ties to fertility issues, a decrease in DHEA can also lead to other conditions later in life, such as Alzheimer's disease, depression, osteoporosis, and heart disease. DHEA supplements are synthesized in a lab and typically sell for less than $20 per 100-count bottle at vitamin stores. However, get your doctor's blessing before you begin taking the supplement because negative side effects are possible. Anytime you tweak the hormone balance in your body, you increase the likelihood of side effects. DHEA's side effects can vary from woman to woman, as well as in severity, but common signs include oily skin and irregular periods. However, if you are having issues with your fertility, irregular periods may already be a common symptom in your life. If you are over 30 and are having problems getting pregnant naturally or with reproductive assistance, it is worth asking your OB/GYN or reproductive endocrinologist about DHEA. Depending on your diagnosis and your course of treatment, your doctor might recommend trying DHEA as a part of your treatment protocol.  Shutterstock image"
 Folic Acid in Pregnancy Shown To Reduce Autism Risk,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/special-needs-blog/brian-parentingcom/autism-folic-acid-pregnancy,"Prenatal folic acid supplements appear to reduce the risk for autistic spectrum disorders, according to a new study  published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association  (JAMA). Taking folic acid supplements during early pregnancy had already been known to protect against spina bifida and other neural tube defects in children. But this latest study of 85,176 babies in Norway found that mothers who took folic acid supplements in early pregnancy had a 39 percent reduced risk of having children with autistic disorder compared with mothers who did not take folic acid. Plus:  Folic Acid: Why It's Important However, the window of time in which mothers need to take the folic acid appears to be as narrow as it is critical. Her childs risk of autism was reduced only when the supplements were taken between 4 weeks before to 8 weeks after the start of pregnancy. We examined the rate of autism spectrum disorders in children born to mothers who did or did not take folic acid during pregnancy. There was a dramatic reduction in the risk of autistic disorder in children born to mothers who took folic acid supplements, says Pl Surn, first author and epidemiologist at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH). The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimate that about 1 in 88 children in the U.S. have been identified with an Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). ""This is an actionable and relatively inexpensive item,"" Alycia Halladay, senior director of  environmental and clinical sciences  at Autism Speaks tells  Parenting . com . ""Women who are concerned about the risk in their children should take folic acid as soon as they can before becoming pregnant, as it may reduce the risk of autism in their child."" Plus:  How Much Folic Acid Should You Take? Of course, Halladay is quick to stress that folic acid will not prevent autism; it will merely lower the risk. She also stresses that women who have not taken folic acid need not feel guilty. ""We don't want women coming away from reading this saying 'there is something I could have done that I didn't do',"" she adds. Autism Spectrum Disorders are amongst the most hereditary of mental disorders, but little is known about how the disorder develops. Consequently, methods for diagnosis, prevention, and treatment are limited. Folic acid (Vitamin B9) is required for DNA synthesis and repair in the human body, and its naturally occurring form  folate  is found in leafy vegetables, peas, lentils, beans, eggs, yeast, and liver."
 Hot Diets: Healthy or Harmful?,http://www.parenting.com/article/hot-diets-healthy-or-harmful,"Three diets that promise  weight  loss and better health have made their way into kitchens across the country. But are they safe for you and your kids? We asked Helen Rasmussen, senior research dietitian at Tufts University, to cut through the hype: Atkins The diet:  High fat, high protein, and very low carbs. When you consume few carbohydrates, your body enters a state called ketosis, and it supposedly starts burning its own fat for fuel. Typical meal:  An eight-ounce hamburger minus the bun and lettuce with full-fat salad dressing Safe for adults?  Perhaps, but with supplements. The diet lacks vitamins generally found only in produce, and experts are split over the safety of such a high-fat plan. Some maintain that any weight loss is mainly water and will come back. Safe for kids?  Absolutely not. Ketosis isn't healthy for them, and they need nutrients like vitamin C and calcium. Macrobiotic The diet:  A plan that consists of 50 to 60 percent whole grains and 20 to 30 percent vegetables, with limited fish, fruits, nuts, and seeds. No red meat, poultry, dairy, or sugar. Typical meal:  Brown rice, baked tofu, miso soup, and herbal tea Safe for adults?  Yes, but only with supplements like calcium and B12. Safe for kids?  No. Studies show that kids on a macrobiotic diet become malnourished and have weak bones. Raw foods The diet:  Unprocessed and organic plant-based foods, such as fruits, vegetables, nuts, and grains. The main requirement: Nothing is heated above 118 degrees (the temperature at which energizing enzymes break down, say raw-foods followers). Typical meal:  Raw vegetable soup, vegetable nut loaf, and coconut water Safe for adults?  Yes, with a multivitamin and fatty-acid supplements. Safe for kids?  No. Growing bodies need protein and available calcium, which may be in short supply here."
 Vitamin D May Improve IVF Success,http://www.parenting.com/fertility/infertility/vitamin-d-may-improve-ivf-success,"Vitamin D is a steroid hormone that is produced in the skin as a result of sun exposure as well as absorbed from fortified foods. It's generally associated with bone health, but animal studies have shown that the hormone affects fertility in many mammals. A study published in the Endocrine Society's ""Journal of Clinical Endocrinology & Metabolism,"" examined  vitamin D's role in the success of in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles , and it found that it's linked to better quality embryos and higher successful implantation rates. Researchers followed 154 women who were vitamin D deficient and 181 women who had sufficient levels of vitamin D in their blood. The women who had sufficient vitamin D were nearly twice as likely to conceive through their IVF cycle as their deficient counterparts. Women who had vitamin D levels of at least 20 ng/ml in their blood were considered to have sufficient levels of the hormone. Levels of 30 ng/ml are recommended for general health. ""Although randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the findings, our results certainly suggest that  low levels of vitamin D contribute to infertility ,"" said Alessio Paffoni, MSc, of the Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico in Milan, Italy, and one of the study's authors. ""Since vitamin D supplementation is an inexpensive and simple intervention with few relevant side effects, additional study in this area has the potential to markedly influence the way infertility is treated."" But  Dr. Tanmoy Mukherjee , associate director of the Mount Sinai Division of Reproductive Endocrinology and co-director of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York, says women shouldn't necessarily run out to grab vitamin D supplements quite yet. Instead, he advises all of his patients, men and women, to take a multivitamin as a part of their fertility protocol. Even if patients have a great diet and lifestyle, a multivitamin insures the body is getting everything it needs to function at the best possible level. If you think your level is low, you can increase your vitamin D by getting out in the sunlight more and eating fortified foods like orange juice or milk. Cheese, egg yolks and fatty fish, like tuna and salmon, are also foods that are high in vitamin D. Don't take supplements in excess of 1000iu per day without first consulting your medical doctor."

 The Importance of Vitamin D,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-importance-of-vitamin-d,"38:   The percentage of babies and toddlers who don't get enough  vitamin  D Your child needs this vitamin to help her body absorb calcium and build healthy bones. Plus, there's mounting evidence that vitamin D reduces the risk of Type 1 diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and certain cancers. Kids need at least 200 international units a day -- about two eight-ounce glasses of milk. Formula is fortified, but breastfed babies should get liquid supplements starting at 2 months, says Catherine Gordon, M.D., lead researcher of a new study on vitamin D at Children's Hospital Boston."
 Vitamin B During Pregnancy,http://www.parenting.com/article/b-prepared,"However, its also vital that women get enough before pregnancy, since its necessary for the very earliest stage of fetal development. The baby needs this nutrient to make the cells for his or her brain and bones, as well as organs and skin. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for folic acid for all women, except those who are pregnant, is 400 micrograms. Best dietary sources are leafy green vegetables (especially spinach), citrus fruits, nuts, legumes, and whole grains. Since getting the daily requirement of folic acid through your diet can be difficult, many women depend on a supplement or multivitamin for help."
 Pick the Right Multivitamin,http://www.parenting.com/article/pick-the-right-multivitamin,"In a perfect world, we'd get all the nutrients we need from food, but who's perfect? Enter multivitamins. A new report from Harvard offers  help  in choosing a good one: Look for the official seal.  Products approved by the U.S. Pharmacopeia Dietary Supplement Verification Program (USP-DSVP) meet certain safety and quality standards. Check how much you're getting.  For trace minerals such as iron, fluoride, and zinc, it's safest not to exceed the daily value. Don't forget that what you get from fortified foods, like many breakfast cereals, counts, too. Choose a product for women.  It's more likely to contain the right doses of the nutrients you need most -- calcium and vitamin D for better bone health, folic acid to prevent birth defects, and iron for replacing what's lost during periods. (If you're pregnant, take a prenatal vitamin; it has more of what you and your baby need.)   Ignore gimmicks.  Whether a vitamin is derived from natural sources or synthesized in a lab, your body uses it the same way. There's also no need to pay more for allergen-free multis if you're not sensitive to specific ingredients. Beware of dangerous interactions.  Pay attention to the warnings on labels, and always tell your doctor or pharmacist what supplements you're taking."
 Does DHA Really Deliver?,http://www.parenting.com/article/does-dha-really-deliver,"The theory:  This essential fatty acid, which occurs naturally in breast  milk , is believed to provide both visual and cognitive benefits to infants -- especially preemies, who need to catch up with their peers -- as they develop. It's been added to many formulas, along with a sister fatty acid, ARA, in recent years. The evidence:  A flurry of new research is proving that ""the positive effects of DHA go way beyond the period when babies are actually consuming it,"" says Connye Kuratko, Ph.D., a dietitian who researched DHA at Texas Tech University. One study showed that the higher the level of DHA in breast milk, the better newborns perform on a neonatal behavior scale at 9 days of age. Another study found that 2-year-olds who received higher levels of DHA as infants could concentrate and stay on task better than their peers. And yet another found that 4-year-olds had higher IQ scores if their moms took DHA supplements during pregnancy and while breastfeeding. The conclusion:  Expectant and breastfeeding moms should take DHA supplements, in the form of a capsule or nutrition bars, along with eating about 12 ounces of low-mercury fish a week (for guidelines, type ""mercury"" in the search bar on fda.gov"
 Multivitamins for Kids: Do Kids With a Healthy Diet Need One?,http://www.parenting.com/article/multivitamins-kids,"Q: Does my child need vitamins if she eats a balanced diet? A:  The short answer is no. Even kids who seem to be picky eaters or who don't eat a varied diet usually do a pretty good job of consuming all the important vitamins and minerals they need. So for most children who are otherwise healthy and have no dietary restrictions, a daily multivitamin is probably not necessary. That said, the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends vitamin D supplementation in all infants, whether breast- or bottle-fed, from birth to possibly even adolescence. This is different from the old recommendation to give vitamin D only to breastfed infants. Studies show that toddlers, older kids, and even some adults are vitamin Ddeficient and could benefit from supplements. Vitamin D keeps bones strong and healthy, and plays a role in keeping the immune system strong as well. There are also certain groups of kids, such as vegetarians and those with food sensitivities who require a strictly controlled diet, who might benefit from a daily multivitamin. It's a good idea to discuss your child's vitamin D intake, as well as other important nutrients such as calcium and iron, with your pediatrician. One more important point to make about vitamins: They can be toxic when taken in excess. Many are designed to look and taste like candy, and a child who takes more than the recommended daily dose could wind up in the emergency room. So be sure to treat vitamins like any other medication: Always keep them locked up and out of reach. Lara Zibners, M.D.,  penned  If Your Kid Eats This Book, Everything Will Still Be Okay .

 Immunity Boosters for Babies,http://www.parenting.com/article/immunity-boosters-for-babies,"Good germs sounds like a contradiction, but that's what probiotics are, says Jose Saavedra, M.D., associate professor of pediatrics at Johns Hopkins University Medical School. Here's how they can help: Benefits:  Probiotics restore balance to the digestive system and ease diarrhea (from a bug or antibiotics). Given in the early months, some may even help prevent allergies. One study found that probiotic drops relieved colic. Where to get them:  Breastfed babies naturally have a higher level of good bacteria. Bottle-fed babies can drink the probiotic-fortified Nestle; Good Start Natural Cultures formula, and Beech Nut's Good Morning and Good Evening baby foods contain prebiotics, a type of fiber that fosters the growth of probiotics. Older babies can get them from certain kinds of yogurt and yogurt drinks (try Stonyfield Farms products). And some doctors recommend probiotic supplements (Florastor Kids, Culturelle for Kids) for antibiotic-related diarrhea. Always talk to your doctor, however, before switching formulas or giving supplements."
 The Vegetarian Mom,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-vegetarian-mom,"No  meat ? No problem. With good planning, vegetarians can easily meet nutritional requirements while pregnant and nursing. ""It's the nutritive quality of a mother's foods, not the original source of each nutrient, that makes the difference in a baby's health,"" says Holly Roberts, M.D., a San Francisco-based ob/gyn and author of  Your Vegetarian Pregnancy . Assess your diet to make sure you're meeting the recommended dietary allowances (ask your doctor for a list or find them in Roberts's book). The steps below can help you overcome some common challenges: Mix it up.  Vary foods daily so that trace minerals and nutrients you don't consume one day will be consumed later that week. Take prenatal vitamins.  Supplements help pick up the slack where your diet falls short, says Roberts. Ask your health care provider whether you also need to take a calcium supplement to help you meet the recommended 1,200 milligrams (mg) per day, particularly if you don't eat dairy. Pump up your iron.  A mother transfers a total of up to 1,000 mg of iron to her baby during pregnancy, which could cause her to develop iron-deficiency anemia, a condition characterized by fatigue. Although red meat is the most commonly known source, it's not the only way to get the mineral. Increase daily intake to 30 mg by eating foods like lentils, spinach, chickpeas, pumpkin, and almonds. Your doctor will perform a blood test to see if you need supplements beyond the iron you're getting in your prenatal vitamin. B aggressive.  B vitamins are vital to moms. One of the most critical in this group is folic acid, which helps prevent neural tube defects when it's taken in the earliest weeks of pregnancy (so start taking prenatal vitamins when you're trying to conceive). Most pregnant women need a total of 600 micrograms (mcg) of folate (400 mcg from a supplement and 200 mcg from foods) -- though some doctors may recommend more for vegetarians. Good sources of folate include beans, nuts, greens, and fortified breads and cereals. Vegans, in particular, are at risk for deficiencies of B12, a.k.a. cobalamin, because they don't eat meat, dairy, or eggs, the most common sources of the vitamin. The Centers for Disease Control recently warned that maternal deficiencies of B12 can cause developmental delays in infants. It recommends a supplement of 2.6 mcg during pregnancy and 2.8 mcg while nursing. Pack in the protein.  Protein is essential for building your baby's bones and tissues during pregnancy, as well as helping you produce breast milk postpartum. Eat larger amounts of such protein-rich foods as eggs, yogurt, and milk (if you include dairy in your diet), as well as beans, nuts, and tofu to get the recommended 60 grams per day during pregnancy and 65 grams while nursing. It's not a huge hurdle if you consider that one cup of firm tofu has 40 grams of protein. Shutterstock Image"
 Breastfeeding Problems and Solutions,http://www.parenting.com/article/breastfeeding-problems-and-solutions,"Breastfeeding even under the best of circumstances can present challenges, as both mother and baby are learning what to do. Yet, breastfeeding is well worth the effort it takes to overcome hurdles you encounter. Your baby receives important nutritional, immunological, and developmental benefits, and both of you get to enjoy the special closeness of a nursing mother and baby. Here are some common breastfeeding problems mothers experience, and the solutions our personal and professional experience has taught us. How can I get my baby to latch on properly? In our experience, the most common breastfeeding obstacle is improper latch-on. A baby who does not take the breast correctly will not get as much milk and will probably give his mother sore nipples. Here's what we tell mothers: First, position yourself correctly. Milk flows better from a relaxed mother, and it's easier to breastfeed your baby if your arms, back, and shoulders are well-supported. Prepare a nursing station in your favorite room with a comfortable chair, plenty of pillows for support, and peace and quiet or soothing music. After you've prepared your body to breastfeed, prepare your mind. Take a few relaxing breaths and imagine your nourishing milk flowing from your breasts into your baby. Help your infant to relax, too. If she's crying, rock and sing to her until she quiets down. If she's sleepy, gently bring her body into a sitting position while saying her name. Babies latch on best when they are in a quiet, yet alert, state. Next, position your baby correctly. Whether you use the cradle hold (baby cradled in your arms lying on a pillow on your lap), the clutch or football hold (baby's body tucked to the side, under your arm, near your breast, neck supported by your cupped hand), or the side-lying position (nursing in bed), be sure that Baby's head and body are turned to face your breast with her mouth at the level of your nipple. Pull her in close -- she should not have to turn her head or strain her neck to reach your nipple. Cup your breast in your hand, with your fingers and palm underneath and thumb on top, well behind the areola. Avoid the ""cigarette hold"" (when the nipple is between your two fingers) because your fingers would be right where baby needs to latch on. Express a few drops of milk. Using your milk-moistened nipple, gently massage your baby's lips, encouraging her to open her mouth wide, like yawning. As she opens wide, direct your nipple slightly upward and toward the center of her mouth, and with a rapid arm movement, pull her close to you, so that her mouth will close down over your areola. We call this technique ""RAM,"" an abbreviation of ""rapid arm movement."" It may sound startling at first to say ""RAM Baby on,"" but it really helps mothers remember two important components of latching on: that they need to move their arm to draw their infant in closer (rather than leaning forward, which can make their backs sore), and that they must move quickly before the baby's mouth closes again. Make sure your baby feeds from the areola, not just the nipple. To prevent painful breastfeeding, her gums should take in a one-inch radius around the nipple as she latches on. Compressing this area allows your baby to get more milk, since the milk sinuses are located under the areola. Contributing editors Martha Sears, R.N., and William Sears, M.D., are coauthors of  The Breastfeeding Book. Pinching, Cracked Nipples, and How Much Is Enough What if I feel a pinching sensation? While a bit of initial discomfort is to be expected in the first two to four days of breastfeeding, persistent pain usually means your baby is not latching on properly. To improve Baby's latch-on, be sure his mouth is wide open as he takes the breast; both of his lips should be turned out (everted). When your baby takes the breast with mouth open wide, he'll have a ""fish mouth"" look as he nurses, and you should not be able to see your nipple. Be sure your baby's tongue is between his lower gum and your breast. (If you pull down gently on Baby's lower lip, you should be able to see his tongue.) If his bottom lip is pulled inward instead of outward, use the index finger of the hand that is supporting your breast to pull out that lower lip. (You may need a helper to take a peek under the breast and do this for you while Baby is latched on.) This ""lower lip flip,"" as we call it, may be all that's needed to keep your infant from tight-mouthing your nipple. If your baby doesn't get onto the breast well at the first try, take him off (break the suction with your little finger inserted into his mouth) and try again, waiting for that wide-open mouth. Don't settle for a less-than-great latch-on: Be patient, keep trying, and soon your baby will learn exactly what to do. How can I tell if my baby is getting enough milk? In the first few weeks, many mothers worry about whether their babies are getting enough breast milk. There's no handy way to measure the ounces going in, and the amount of milk you can pump bears little relation to how much milk your baby is getting from the breast. It's better to watch the baby for signs that he is getting enough to eat. Do you notice a few drops of milk leaking from the sides of your baby's mouth and hear him swallow after every one or two sucks? Does he seem content after a feeding? By the fourth day after birth, your baby should wet about six diapers a day. Pale, almost water-colored urine suggests baby is getting enough milk to stay adequately hydrated; darker, apple-juice-colored urine suggests that he is not. Baby's stool output is another helpful indicator. Within a day or two of your milk coming in, your baby's bowel movements change from sticky black meconium to ""milk stools."" These are yellow, seedy, mustard-colored and the consistency of cottage cheese. Babies between 1 and 4 weeks who are getting enough milk will produce at least two to three of these stools a day, often more. If a lot of urine and stools come out in the diaper, rest assured that enough milk is going in. (During the second or third month, some breastfed babies may have only one bowel movement a day while still getting enough milk.) You'll also observe that your breasts feel softer after a feeding in which baby takes plenty of milk. The bottom line is baby's weight gain. After the normal initial loss of five to seven percent of their birth weight (five to seven ounces for an average 6-pound baby), babies should regain their birth weight by two weeks of age. As a general guide, a baby getting sufficient milk should gain four to seven ounces a week, or a minimum of a pound a month. If you think your baby is not getting enough milk, take immediate steps to improve nursing (a lactation consultant or your doctor can help) and take your child to the pediatrician every few days. What if I have cracked nipples? Cracked nipples are usually caused by improper latch-on. When your baby doesn't get enough breast tissue into his mouth, all the sucking pressure is concentrated on the nipple. Try feeding Baby first on the side that is the least sore. Usually the most uncomfortable part of a feeding is the minute or two of sucking it takes to trigger your milk-ejection reflex. Once the milk is flowing freely, nursing will probably be more comfortable. Mothers with sore nipples are often tempted to nurse less frequently, but this aggravates the problem, since your breast can become engorged, making it more difficult for Baby to latch on. Try to feed  more  frequently while being vigilant about proper latch-on. After nursing, you can massage medical-grade ultrapure lanolin ointment onto the cracked area. If the crack does not improve within a day or two, call a lactation consultant. If it becomes infected (if your baby has thrush, for example, the yeast can infect your breasts), your doctor can prescribe medication. Clogged Ducts and Feeding After C-Section How do I handle a clogged milk duct? If you notice a tender lump somewhere in your breast, it may mean that a duct leading from the milk-producing glands to the nipple is blocked with milk. Untreated, the area can become inflamed and even infected (a condition called mastitis). To treat a clogged duct, apply warm moist compresses to the area for a few minutes before feeding. Breastfeeding on the sore side first often helps, as your baby is more likely to dislodge the plug at the beginning of a feeding when her sucking is strongest. As Baby nurses, gently massage the area down toward the areola to encourage the plug to clear. If you start to develop flu-like symptoms (fever, chills, body aches, and fatigue), you may have mastitis. Your doctor can prescribe antibiotics. Plugged ducts are most likely to occur when your infant is nursing less often -- if you're away from home, or when she suddenly begins to sleep for longer stretches at night. To prevent them from recurring, breastfeed frequently, especially if your breasts feel full. (If your baby isn't hungry, pump and store the milk.) Feeding your baby in different positions also helps. Avoid tight bras and sleeping on your stomach, as both can put unnecessary pressure on your breasts. Most important, get adequate rest: Recurrent mastitis can be a sign of a run-down immune system. I'm scheduled for a c-section. How will I breastfeed during my recovery? After a cesarean birth, your body must be allowed to heal while you learn to care for your baby and breastfeed. You need extra help: Ask the nurses or your lactation consultant for help with early feedings, and have them show your partner how to help you get positioned for nursing. Breastfeed in the side-lying and clutch-hold positions to keep Baby's weight off your incision. Use lots of pillows: If you nurse lying down on your side, you'll need two pillows behind your back, a pillow between your knees, one under your head, and one to support baby on his side. Wedging a ""tummy pillow"" between the bed and your abdomen can help keep the pressure off your incision. You can also nurse while sitting up in bed; a day or two after surgery, you may be more comfortable nursing while sitting up in a chair, with your infant on pillows in your lap. Some mothers mistakenly assume that they should refuse pain medication, but there are medications that are safe for breastfeeding moms to take. Pain will only suppress your milk production and keep you from enjoying your first few days with your new baby. The anesthesiologist can give you a long-acting anesthetic immediately after the birth to ease postoperative pain when you are first holding and nursing your baby. It may take a bit longer for your milk to come in following a cesarean birth, and longer for the baby to learn to latch on, but mothers who have surgical births can be just as successful at breastfeeding as mothers who deliver vaginally. Supplements and Biting What if I need to supplement with formula? ""Combo feeding"" (breastfeeding and supplemental formula) can work, but it's important to get breastfeeding off to a good start for a few weeks before introducing commercial nipples. Otherwise, babies can become ""nipple confused,"" which means they try to suck at the breast the way they get milk out of a bottle. This is not very effective, and it can be painful! If formula supplementation is medically necessary within the first month, a lactation consultant can help you try supplementing with a syringe or a nursing supplementer, a handy device that delivers breast milk or formula through a flexible tube attached to your nipple, while baby breastfeeds. Supplementers help babies learn to suck from a mother's nipple. As an added perk, mother gets the milk-making hormonal stimulation as Baby sucks at her breast. Breastfed babies sometimes refuse to take bottles offered by Mom because it just doesn't feel right. Dad or a substitute caregiver may be more successful at persuading a baby that food can come from other sources. Choose a nipple with a wide base so that baby has to open his mouth wide as he does at the breast. This will minimize problems with lazy latch-on when baby is fed at the breast. Don't take it personally if your baby appears to prefer pumped breast milk or formula from a bottle. It usually doesn't take as much effort to get milk from a commercial nipple. (This is a good reason to avoid them in the early weeks.) If you are planning to combine breastfeeding with formula supplements, or if you find yourself doing this, try to give breastfeeding priority. The more you substitute formula feedings for feedings at the breast, the less milk your breasts will make, and it's possible that your baby's interest in breastfeeding will also wane. Combo feeding works for many mothers, but use some caution or your baby may stop breastfeeding before you had planned on weaning. Help! My baby bites during feedings! Babies eventually sprout teeth, with the first ones arriving around six months of age, and when they get them, they experiment with them, which can lead to a startled ""ouch"" from Mom when she gets nipped during nursing. Even though babies do bite the breast that feeds them, you don't need to be a human pacifier. And, this doesn't mean it's time to wean (even toddlers with lots of teeth can breastfeed without causing pain). It is time to teach your baby some nursing manners. It's okay to holler ""ouch!"" when Baby clamps down. To pry your nipple out of your child's mouth without any further damage, wedge a finger in between his gums and hook it around your nipple. If he bites down again before the nipple is out of his mouth, your finger will protect your tender nipple. That startled ""ouch"" may frighten some babies and intrigue others. If your baby cries at your reaction, calm him and immediately resume nursing. If he bites again -- with a curious gleam in his eye -- it's time to end the feeding and do something else together. Eventually, your infant will associate biting with an end to the feeding, and will stop biting. Another trick used by mothers of biters, me included, is to draw the baby in closer to the breast as soon as you feel that first nip, or even when Baby looks like he's about to bite. He'll automatically let go in order to breathe. Breastfeeding requires large doses of commitment, a helping of patience, and a sense of humor. While you may experience some problems, rest assured that with help, you will likely be able to work through these challenges and enjoy this special bond with your baby."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Probiotics,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-probiotics,"Q.  What are your thoughts on probiotics, where live cultures of bacteria are used to replenish the good bacteria that might have been wiped out after taking too many antibiotics? How does this work? Does it  help ? A.  Probiotics are medically defined as organisms in fermented foods that promote good health and establish the right balance of intestinal bacteria. Billions of bacteria reside in healthy intestines where they contribute to the health of the colon. Probiotic supplements are just these same bacteria packaged as supplements in powder or in capsule form. Do probiotics help? Well, when I teach parents and older children about intestinal health, one of my lessons is ""Put the right bugs in your bowels."" It's a symbiotic relationshipthese bugs reside in the warm environment of the colon and in return they do the following good things for the body: Keep harmful bacteria in check The resident probiotic bacteria fight any harmful germs that may enter the intestines. Probiotics are now being used in nearly all intestinal inflammatory illnesses. Help antibiotic-induced diarrhea I always prescribe probiotics to be used during, and for at least two weeks after, antibiotic treatment. Antibiotics kill the bad germs that can cause infections throughout the body, but they also can kill the beneficial bacteria in the bowels. Probiotics replenish the healthful bacteria that may have been killed by the antibiotics and restore the balance between healthful and harmful bacteria in the bowels. Work as preventive medicine Studies have shown that probiotics can lessen the spread of diarrhea outbreaks in daycare settings. Probiotics seem to significantly decrease the shedding of viruses in the stools of affected children. Produce good fats These healthful bacteria ferment the soluble fiber in food, producing healthful short-chain fatty acids that nourish the cells of the large intestine, thereby promoting healing of infected intestinal lining. These protective fatty acids are also thought to reduce the development of intestinal cancer and inhibit the growth of harmful bacteria and they travel to the liver where they can decrease the liver's production of excess cholesterol. The health benefits of probiotics have been known for over a hundred years. In fact, in the early 1900s Professor Metchnikoff at the Pasteur Institute in France won the Nobel Prize for his studies relating to probiotics after he noticed the prolonged lifespan of Bulgarian peasants who consumed a lot of yogurt. Probiotics have been used in preventive medicine throughout Europe for many years. They are just now gaining more scientific credibility and popularity in the United States. For example, a study done in 2001 showed that giving probiotics to pregnant mothers with high risk for allergies was associated with significantly decreased incidence of eczema in their babies. This is thought to be because probiotics promote the overall health of the immune system. You may already have probiotics in your diet if you eat yogurt. Many yogurts contain the probiotics  acidophilus, bifidus,  and  bulgaricus.  When buying yogurt, be sure the label says ""live and active cultures."" This is the official statement of the National Yogurt Association signifying that healthful probiotic bacteria have been added after pasteurization. Avoid yogurts that do not carry this label. If you are looking for a supplement, the probiotic that I personally prescribe in my pediatric practice is Culturelle, which is  lactobacillus GG,  the probiotic that has been used in many scientific studies."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Raising a Vegetarian Child,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-raising-a-vegetarian-child,"Q. My daughter-in-law is raising my granddaughter to be a vegetarian. The baby is only 13 months old. Is that  healthy  for her at such a young age? A.  Yes, it can be -- but only if your daughter-in-law observes certain nutritional precautions. It also depends on what you mean by vegetarian. Being a strict vegetarian (or a vegan) who avoids all foods of animal origin, including eggs, dairy products, fish, meat, and poultry, is very risky in kids because such diets can be too low in nutrients necessary for growing children. But in my opinion, a pesco-vegetarian diet that includes fish, dairy products, and eggs, yet excludes meat, can be extremely healthy for children of all ages. Here are the precautions your daughter-in-law should observe: Supplement with omega 3s.  A strictly vegan diet is deficient in omega 3s, healthy fats that are important for growing bodies and growing brains. A child's first source of omega 3s is breast milk, which is rich in DHA, the prime brain-building fat. After weaning, seafood is the richest source of DHA, especially in the form of coldwater fish like wild salmon. Vegans sometimes argue that you can get DHA from plant sources, such as flax and canola oils, but this is not strictly biochemically correct. While there are omega 3 fats in plant foods, the body has to go through a lot of biochemical changes to convert plant omega 3's into brain-building DHA. If your daughter-in-law should give your granddaughter a plant-form DHA supplement, algae-source DHA is a beneficial one.  Guard against vitamin deficiencies.  While children can grow optimally on a diet of grains, greens, fruits, and vegetables, it's nutritionally risky. To make sure your granddaughter's diet is adequate in B-vitamins, especially B-12, have your daughter-in-law write down everything the child eats for a week and consult a professional nutritionist for what is called a nutritional analysis. This computer analysis of a weekly diet will reveal whether the child is getting adequate vitamins, minerals, fats, and proteins. In my practice, I recommend that all vegans have a periodic nutritional analysis.  Mind your minerals.  While kids can get enough calcium from plant foods, such as fortified orange juice, tofu, figs, whole grains, collard greens, and spinach, vegans are at risk for being deficient in two minerals: zinc (important for a high-functioning immune system) and iron (important for building healthy blood and brains). The best plant sources of iron are tofu, iron-fortified cereals, legumes, lentils, and beans, and the best vegetarian sources of zinc are tofu, artichokes, chick peas, beans, and zinc-fortified cereals. Nevertheless, it's difficult for children on a vegetarian diet to get the recommended daily 10 milligrams of zinc.  For the sake of nutritional safety, I recommend that all vegetarian children take a daily multivitamin/multimineral supplement, as well as omega 3 supplements. For more information, you may want to ask your daughter-in-law to read the chapter ""Raising a Healthy Vegetarian"" in my book  The Family Nutrition Book . Remember, advising a daughter-in-law on the feeding of her own child is a tricky business. It's essential that you be both politically and nutritionally correct. And stay positive -- she is, after all, instilling healthy eating habits and a love of fruits and vegetables in your grandchild."
 The Skinny on Calcium,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-skinny-on-calcium,"Another reason to praise skim milk: ""People with high-calcium diets burn more fat than those who get less calcium,"" says James Hill, Ph.D., director of the Center for Human Nutrition at the University of Colorado  Health  Sciences Center. (Ironically, many popular weight-loss programs-- including Atkins and Sugar Busters-- provide less than 60 percent of the recommended amount of calcium.) For the fat-burning effect, supplements, fortified foods, and nondairy sources, such as broccoli and tofu, can help, but dairy products are most effective. Calories count, though! Substitute low-fat versions for empty calories you're already consuming, and aim for three servings a day to get the recommended amount of 1,000 milligrams of calcium. Good choices:  8-ounce glass of skim milk   1 1/2 ounces of reduced-fat cheese  8 ounces of low-fat yogurt"
 Could You Be At Risk For Anemia?,http://www.parenting.com/article/could-you-be-at-risk-for-anemia,"For many women, pregnancy can be as tiring as it is exciting. While some fatigue is normal for moms-to-be, excessive tiredness may be a sign of anemia, a deficiency of red blood cells (which carry oxygen in the blood) that affects up to half of pregnant women. Why is this condition so common? During a normal pregnancy, the volume of fluid in a woman's blood increases by as much as 50 percent, diluting the concentrations of red blood cells and hemoglobin, a critical protein in these cells. If levels drop too low, the body's ability to carry oxygen to the lungs, tissues, and the baby can be compromised. Untreated, a severe case of anemia can cause poor fetal growth, preterm birth, and low birth weight. But since women are routinely tested for the condition at their first prenatal visit and then again during their second trimester, doctors usually catch the condition before it becomes serious. ""In the majority of cases, when the condition is diagnosed and treated, it's not going to harm you or your baby,"" says Laura Riley, M.D., a maternal-fetal medicine specialist at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston. Here's what you need to know: Causes:  The most common cause is just pregnancy itself, says Dr. Riley. When anemia is the result of increasing blood fluid volume (the most common cause), it's called ""physiologic"" anemia of pregnancy. The second most common type, iron-deficiency anemia, comes from decreased iron stores in the body. (Iron is needed in pregnancy to make hemoglobin and red blood cells for both mom and her baby-to-be.) Less commonly, anemia in pregnancy can also be caused by a folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency. A more serious and rare form is caused by an inherited predisposition to anemia called thalassemia, which is mainly seen among people from the Mediterranean and the Middle East. Even more rare, anemia in pregnancy can be the result of sickle-cell anemia, which is most commonly seen in African- Americans. Symptoms:  Most women won't have any symptoms. If they do occur, symptoms can be identical to those of pregnancy: fatigue, a drop in exercise tolerance, and shortness of breath. In more acute cases, a woman may also notice pale skin, lips, and nails; dizziness; and a rapid heartbeat. Diagnosis:  Most cases of anemia are detected during the complete blood count (CBC) done on every woman when she comes in for her first prenatal visit and again at 28 weeks, says Dr. Riley. If anemia is found, your doctor may order more tests to target the cause. Treatment:  There's nothing you can do about physiologic anemia, says Dr. Riley, except wait it out. Moms-to-be with iron-deficiency anemia will be counseled to eat iron-rich foods and to take an iron supplement (in addition to a prenatal vitamin) together with vitamin C for better absorption. (Caffeine, on the other hand, can inhibit the absorption.) Sources of iron-rich foods include red meat, beans, peas, dark-green leafy vegetables, iron-fortified cereals, dried fruits, nuts, and whole-wheat breads. Though taking an iron supplement can lead to constipation and nausea, it reduces symptoms and restores red-blood-cell count to normal levels, says Dr. Riley. Most iron-deficiency anemia cases will clear up in a few weeks. Exercise, as well as extra fluids and fiber, can help reduce the constipation associated with iron supplements. Those with folic acid- or B12-deficiency anemia will be instructed to take supplements of those vitamins. Prevention:  Women who are pregnant or thinking about trying to become pregnant should remember to take a daily multivitamin that includes iron and folic acid, in addition to eating a variety of iron-rich foods."
 On Call: Getting Enough Fluoride?,http://www.parenting.com/article/on-call-getting-enough-fluoride,"Q. My new house is supplied by  well  water. Will it provide my kids with the amount of fluoride they need? A.  It's a good question -- and one with no simple answer. Fluoride is important for teeth and bone health. Adding it to the public water supply has been shown to help reduce the number of cavities children get. That doesn't mean your kids aren't getting enough of the mineral, though. Many foods and drinks today are made with water that contains fluoride, so your children may be consuming enough of it to compensate. There's fluoride in their toothpaste, and fluoride treatments are part of a routine dentist's visit. In fact, getting too much fluoride can damage and discolor the enamel on unerupted teeth. To be sure, have your water tested by an expert to see how much fluoride is in it -- check with your local water department or department of public health for details -- and then talk to your doctor. He'll help you decide whether his prescribing a supplement makes sense."
 On Call: Cause for Tooth Discoloration,http://www.parenting.com/article/on-call-cause-for-tooth-discoloration,"Q. Our  toddler  has gray stains on her lower teeth. What causes this? A.  There are lots of possible reasons for gray-looking teeth. Did you take tetracycline or a similar antibiotic when you were pregnant? Doing so can affect the fetus's teeth and cause stains when they erupt. The discoloration could also be due to trauma to the mouth. My eldest child, Michaela, did a face plant in the driveway when she was a toddler and had a gray front tooth until it was pulled later. Other possible culprits are poor dental hygiene (you should brush your daughter's teeth regularly as soon as they come in), food stains, past infections, and medications she's taken, such as liquid iron supplements. Some liver and blood diseases can also cause teeth to look gray. And while it's rare, problems with tooth enamel can sometimes be the explanation. Bottom line: Talk to your doctor to figure out the cause. Together you can decide whether your daughter needs treatment and whether the stains can be removed."
 Relactation: Get Back in the Flow of Breastfeeding,http://www.parenting.com/article/relactation-get-back-flow-breastfeeding,"Got Milk? When my first child was born, I knew breastfeeding was for me, and luckily my baby girl adapted immediately without any latching difficulties. Unfortunately, my breasts seemed to have trouble producing enough milk, and after a few months, my baby was not getting enough to eat. I was young and didn't know any better, so when the doctor suggested that I supplement breastfeeding with formula, I just did what I was told. As a result, my milk dried up completely, and my daughter was formula-fed from then on. With my second child, I was determined to make a go of breastfeeding again. A few months of nursing went by, and once again, my milk production started to slow. This time, I sought the help of a licensed lactation consultant, who helped me use relactation techniques to increase my milk supply. As a result, I successfully nursed my daughter without trouble for a couple of years. But then I started to feel pressure from family and friends to wean my daughter;I eventually succumbed to that pressure, even though neither I nor my child was ready to wean. The abrupt change in our breastfeeding schedule caused my milk to stop flowing, but worst of all, we were both unhappy. After a couple of months, I found the strength inside myself to try breastfeeding again. I went back to my lactation consultant to brush up on the relactation techniques, and I was able to get my milk flowing again. I ended up nursing my child until she was almost 4 years old. Weaning the second time around was easy because we were both ready for it. Could Relactation Help You? If your breast milk stops flowing, or never started in the first place, certain techniques can help you increase your milk supply. These techniques can help if you want to breastfeed again after stopping, increase the production of your milk, or even start producing milk for an adopted baby. According to La Leche League International , you do not need to have ever been pregnant in order to begin producing breast milk. La Leche League says, ""Adoptive mothers may be able to induce lactation by using a breast pump every 2-3 hours, either before the baby comes or after. Some also use a device, such as the Medela Supplemental Nursing System or the Lact-Aid Nurser Training System . These both enable you to feed your baby while he is at your breast. This way, your baby gets enough milk while stimulating your body to produce your own milk."" When your nipples are stimulated through pumping or nursing, it increases production of the hormones that help your breasts make milk. I used this type of supplemental nursing device when I needed help to restart my own milk flow, and it worked like a charm. According to a study in the Journal of Tropical Pediatrics , approximately 92 percent of women taking part in the study experienced full relactation after using stimulation techniques. However, everyone's situation is unique. Issues that could affect your relactation success include: Nipple anatomy:Some women have inverted or damaged nipples that need special care. Age of your baby:Older and adopted babies may take longer to start breastfeeding, especially if they have never nursed before. Special needs:Babies with cleft palettes, Down syndrome or other special needs can take a little longer to restart nursing. Support:Having a circle of supportive friends and family can give you the motivation you might need to keep going. Above all, if you start with a strong desire to breastfeed, that strength can help make your relactation a success for both you and your baby. Begin by consulting with a licensed lactation consultant to discuss your specific situation. She can help you find out why you have trouble producing milk and can teach you how to increase milk supply with a supplemental nursing system."
 Study Finds Link Between Autism and Excess Folate during Pregnancy,http://www.parenting.com/news-break/study-finds-link-between-autism-and-excess-folate-during-pregnancy,"The Short of It A new study looks at the link between  folate levels in pregnancy and a baby's risk of developing autism  later in life. The Lowdown For years, pregnant women have been told taking folic acid, which is the synthetic form of the vitamin folate and is found in foods like spinach, beans, and fortified cereals and snacks, is vital for the healthy development of a growing baby's brain and nervous system. Now, new research finds there may be too much of a good thing when it comes to ingesting folate during pregnancy. More from News Break:   Couple in Their 70s Become Parents for the First Time Researchers looked at 1,391 kids born at Boston University Medical Center from 1998 to 2013. Approximately 100 kids were later diagnosed with an autism spectrum disorder. When researchers found high levels of folate in a mother's blood at the time of delivery, she was  twice as likely to have an autistic child . A high level of vitamin B12 also seemed to elevate one's riskthreefold. In fact, when both levels were very high, researchers found a 17-fold greater risk that a child would later develop autism. Interestingly, most moms who participated in the study took multivitamins that contained folic acid and vitamin B12, yet only some women showed high levels in their blood. This could mean those women took too many supplements, perhaps consumed too much folate in their diets as well, or there could be a genetic reason some moms absorb more folate. More from News Break:   Mom Helped Daughter Beat Cancer, But Now She's Fighting the Disease It's important to point out that the vitamin levels were tested at birth, not during early pregnancy when a baby's brain is developing. It's also worth noting that experts have called the findings of this study into question because they were based on a small sample of families at a single hospital. Plus, a  2013 study found the opposite relationship  between folate during pregnancy and a child's risk of having autism. So it would be right to feel confused by the many studies that look at pregnancy nutrition and behaviors and their link to having an autistic child. The Upshot The bottom line is this study is not recommending that pregnant women change their folate intake. "" We are not suggesting anyone stop supplementation ,"" researcher M. Daniele Fallin told Salon. And no cause and effect relationship has been established; this study simply found a link between high levels of folate in a mother's blood at birth and a child's risk for developing autism later in life. More from News Break:   Math Test Question for 7-Year-Olds Puzzles Parents But this study, which was presented at the International Meeting for Autism Research in Baltimore this week, does raise an interesting question. ""The new research question before us is to  understand the optimal dose ,"" said Fallin. Dr. Paul Wang, senior vice president of medical research for Autism Speaks, says this study shows when pregnant women take folic acid and B12 three to five times a week, there's a protective effect against autism. ""What we've always believed to be true remains true, that  supplements decrease the risk of autism . The bottom line still is that taking the recommended vitamins is overall decreasing your child's risk,"" he says. So it seems the best strategy is to work with your doctor to come up with the right prenatal supplementation program for you. Don't forget to like us on  Facebook  and  Twitter !"
 The Lowdown on Vitamin D,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-lowdown-on-vitamin-d,"More than half of  kids  don't get what they need. Why that's bad:  Vitamin D helps the body absorb calcium, so without enough of it, bones may not develop properly. Researchers are also finding strong links between low D levels and other conditions, most recently Type 1 diabetes, the second most common chronic disease in children. What's going on:  Ordinarily, most of the vitamin D we get would come from sun exposure. But the sunscreen we slather on (for good reason!) completely blocks the UVB rays that our bodies convert into D, says James Dowd, M.D., associate professor of medicine at Michigan State University in East Lansing. That leaves us to get D from food, and there aren't many kid-friendly sources. Milk and some cereals, OJs, and yogurts are fortified with D, but not all kids down enough of these. Finally, breast milk has a very low concentration of vitamin D, putting babies who are exclusively breastfed at particular risk. The solution:  Some experts are in favor of letting kids older than 6 months soak up some rays sans sunscreen -- 10 to 15 minutes three times a week at midday, except during winter, when the level of UVB rays is insufficient. That said, not all doctors or parents are comfortable with the strategy, given possible risks of sun damage. In that case, supplementation is the other way to go. The American Academy of Pediatrics advises that kids get 400 IU of D per day, and specifically recommends a supplement for: exclusively and partially breastfed babies until they're drinking at least 32 ounces of milk or formula a day bottle-fed babies who drink fewer than 32 ounces of formula per day older kids who don't get 400 IU per day through other fortified foods. (To help you do the math, there are 100 IU of D in a cup of milk.) Still not sure if your child is at risk for a D deficiency? Your pediatrician can easily help you figure it out."
 Banish Post-Baby Blues,http://www.parenting.com/article/banish-post-baby-blues,"While pregnant, you dutifully loaded up on folate to reduce the risk of neural-tube defects in your newborn, but now research says there's just as much reason to keep supplementing with the nutrient even after the baby arrives. A new study from Tufts University in Boston shows that folate may play a critical role in staving off postpartum depression. Researchers looked at folate concentrations in nearly 3,000 people and found that those with major depression had lower levels of folate in their bloodstream than those who had never been depressed. Longer-lasting, mild depression (dysthymia) was also associated with low folate levels. ""Folate plays an important role in brain function,"" explains Martha Morris, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at Tufts University Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging. ""Low levels of it result in symptoms that can mimic major depression -- including fatigue, difficulty learning, loss of energy, and changes in appetite -- so what looks like depression could actually be a folate deficiency."" Studies show that supplementation with 400 to 500 micrograms of folate a day improves these depressive symptoms and can even make antidepressants work better. So if you're among the 70 to 80 percent of women who feel tired, irritable, and inadequate after childbirth (the baby blues), Morris recommends having a physician check your folate levels. And if you're interested in getting more folate in your diet as a potential mood booster, turn to whole-wheat breads, cereals, rice, and pastas. Thanks to a government mandate requiring folate fortification of all enriched grain products, Americans are already getting an additional 200 micrograms of folic acid daily. Other foods naturally rich in folate include spinach, asparagus, lentils, and beans. You can also continue to take your prenatal vitamins post-baby (many doctors recommend this anyway, especially if you're breastfeeding); that way, you can be sure you're getting the folate you need."
 First Feedings,http://www.parenting.com/article/first-feedings,"If you're planning to breastfeed, you've probably heard that it can take up to four days for your breast  milk  to ""come in."" So what's your baby supposed to eat until then? Most newborns are satisfied with colostrum at first, the nutritious pre-milk fluid, says Michel Cohen, M.D., a pediatrician in New York City and author of  The New Basics: A-to-Z Baby & Child Care for the Modern Parent .   Some babies, however, may need an extra boost, notes Marianne Neifert, M.D., Denver pediatrician and author of  Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding . If it looks like your baby may be losing too much weight or is jaundiced or premature, talk to your baby's doctor right away. He may suggest supplementing with formula for a few days, Dr. Neifert says. ""The more well-nourished your baby is, the more effective he'll become at breastfeeding.""   If you need to supplement, don't worry about ""nipple confusion"" -- the idea that a baby who's given a bottle too early will prefer it to the breast. Nipple confusion is more likely with a baby who is having trouble with the mechanics of breastfeeding, like latching on, rather than a result of a milk supply problem, says Dr. Neifert. It isn't that the baby is confused, but that she discovers where it's easier to get food and gives up on the breast. If your milk isn't in by the third day, tiding your baby over with a bottle may keep her calm and give you some rest.

 Immune Boosters for Moms,http://www.parenting.com/article/immune-boosters-for-moms,"It's an occupational hazard: Take an on-the-go mom, add one or more germ-carrying kids, stir in sleep deprivation, and brace yourself for the germ  du jour . While there's still no cure for the common cold, drinking water (three to four glasses a day), washing your hands often, and getting a good night's sleep can help fend off drippy noses, up-all-night coughs, and more--and the latest research suggests that some natural remedies can be effective, too. Here's the lowdown on what just may work, and what isn't worth your money: Note: Talk with your doctor before taking any supplement, especially if you're pregnant or nursing. Echinacea Fights:  Colds Prevents or treats?  Both Does it work or doesn't it?  Studies have gone both ways over the years, leaving us snifflers scratching our heads. But in the last year, three different research groups have reviewed the existing evidence and concluded that, in high enough doses, the herb  does  appear to offer some relief and protection from the common cold. Echinacea may reduce the average duration of a cold by nearly two days, and the chances of even catching one by 58 percent .   Immune Rx:  During cold and flu season, take an echinacea supplement with at least 900 mg--and no more than 3,000 mg--of standardized echinacea extract daily. Since researchers aren't sure which species or parts of the plant provide the most benefit, look for a supplement that contains a mix of species ( E. purpurea ,  E. pallida , and  E. augustifolia ) and parts (stems, roots, leaves, and flowers). These aren't always noted on the packaging, so look for a product that  does  list the species inside. If you're allergic to sunflowers, daisies, or ragweed, avoid echinacea products derived from the stems, leaves, or flowers--they may contain pollen and could trigger a reaction; stick with a root supplement instead. Probiotics (healthy bacteria) Fights:  Diarrhea, urinary tract infections, vaginal infections, colitis and other gastrointestinal disorders, colds  Prevents or treats?  Both Taking probiotics may have wide-ranging immune-boosting benefits.  Studies show they may help to prevent urinary tract infections, bacterial vaginosis, and vaginal yeast infections; they may also prevent or reduce the severity of upper respiratory infections, colds, stomach bugs, and other common ills. In clinical trials, probiotics have proved a potent remedy for both viral and antibiotic-induced diarrhea. There's also good evidence that they can help to induce or maintain remission in gastrointestinal autoimmune disorders, such as Crohn's disease.  Immune Rx:  You'll find live bacteria in most yogurt, but while eating it has plenty of health benefits, you'd have to swallow  a lot  to get the immunity benefits, says Kelly Karpa, Ph.D., author of  Bacteria for Breakfast: Probiotics for Good Health --in some cases, at least a couple hundred small containers a day! More realistic: For infection prevention and general immune support, take one to two capsules daily of a probiotic supplement containing a mixture of Lactobacillus acidophilus and Bifidobacteria. If you have severe diarrhea, increase that to as many as ten capsules daily.  Choose a supplement that guarantees a minimum of 15 billion live bacteria through the expiration date. If the label lists the number of bacteria ""at time of manufacture,"" save your money--there's no guarantee those bacteria will still be alive by the time the bottle reaches your kitchen. Select a refrigerated product, and keep it cold. Finally, take your probiotics on an empty stomach, since food triggers the production of stomach acids and bile, which can destroy the beneficial bacteria. Garlic Fights:  Bacterial and viral infections (including colds); fungal infections; intestinal parasites; high blood pressure, high cholesterol, atherosclerosis Prevents or treats?  Both In a recent British study, people who took a supplement containing allicin (garlic's active ingredient) daily for 13 weeks in the winter suffered 46 percent fewer colds, were significantly less susceptible to repeat colds, and recovered from the colds they did catch a few days faster than people taking a placebo. Bonus: Many studies suggest garlic may also help to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, prevent atherosclerosis and fungal infections, and reduce cancer risks.  Immune Rx:  To resist infections, eat two to four cloves of fresh garlic daily, or (if you're concerned about your breath scaring away more than just vampires) take a 600 mg to 900 mg garlic supplement containing allicin daily. Garlic acts as a blood thinner, so if you're taking a blood-thinning medication or are about to undergo surgery or deliver a baby, consult your doctor before taking it. Exercise Fights:  Colds (and just about everything else) Prevents or treats?  Prevents If you're sick and tired of being sick and tired, exercise may be your antidote: Researchers at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle have found that  women who worked out regularly for one year lowered their risk of colds by almost half . (""Regularly"" meant doing a moderate-intensity activity, like brisk walking or stationary bicycling, for 45 minutes a day, five days a week.)  Immune Rx:  If you can't do that much exercise all at once, aim for 30 minutes and break it up: Steal 15 minutes at lunch for a brisk walk, and another 15 minutes before or after dinner, advises Cornelia Ulrich, Ph.D., senior investigator on the study. ""I try to build in exercise with my two sons where I can, even if it's playing tag or dancing,"" says Ulrich. Just don't overdo it, especially if you feel a cold coming on. Studies have shown that prolonged intense workouts can  lower  immunity temporarily.[PAGEBREAK] The jury's still out on... Vitamin C  It has a long-standing rep as a cold conqueror, and the latest research suggests it may live up to the hype--but only if you're under  serious  physical stress (even more than the usual mom kind): A recent review of dozens of studies found that a group of marathon runners, skiers, and soldiers who took daily vitamin C supplements cut their chances of catching a cold by about half. For ""regular"" folks, taking 200 mg of vitamin C or more a day shortened colds, but only by about 8 percent in adults and 13 percent in kids.  Bottom line: It can't hurt to load up on citrus fruits, OJ, or C supplements, but it may not help, either.  Zinc Suck on zinc lozenges all you like, but there's no guarantee they'll zap your cold, according to a new review of research on the mineral. True, some studies suggest that zinc does prevent infection and may even cut the length of a cold in half--but an equal number found no infection--fighting benefits. If anything, it's a zinc nasal gel that seems to work best, not the ubiquitous lozenge (and definitely not zinc--containing foods like red meat, since it's nearly impossible to eat enough to see any benefits). Drugstore remedies that  may  work From Airborne to Cold-Eeze, lots of ""natural"" products on store shelves claim to fight cold and flu. Here, two backed by seemingly solid research (the studies were funded by the companies that manufacture them and apply only to these specific name brands, not the plants they contain): Cold fX (Ginseng) Fights:  Colds Prevents or treats?  Both According to a Canadian study, people who took 400 mg of Cold fX--a patented North American ginseng extract--daily for four months experienced 26 percent fewer colds, were half as likely to suffer recurring colds, experienced markedly milder symptoms, and recovered a few days quicker from the colds they did catch than people taking a placebo. It's also been shown in lab studies to bolster immune-system cells. Unfortunately, these results can't be generalized to all ginseng products, since they each contain differing amounts of active ginseng, says Gerry Predy, M.D., who led the study at the University of Alberta.  Immune Rx:  You can take up to 400 mg of Cold fX daily during cold and flu season to prevent or minimize infections. Sambucol (Elderberry) Fights:  Flu Prevents or treats?  Both The elderberry plant has been used for centuries in Europe to relieve flu symptoms, including muscle aches, coughing, congestion, and fever. The best-studied standardized black elderberry extract is Sambucol, a patented formula sold in the United States by Nature's Way. According to research from Israel's Hadassah University Hospital, which tested several Sambucol formulas (including an extract, syrup, and children's formulation), it increases production of inflammatory cytokines, chemicals that stimulate the immune system and bolster its ability to fight off invaders.  Immune Rx:  If you have the flu, you can take two teaspoons of Sambucol four times daily (or two lozenges, three times daily), for three to five days, starting with your first symptoms. (It won't hurt, and might even help!) As a preventive, take two teaspoons of elderberry syrup or two lozenges daily during flu season."
 Guide to Starting Baby on Solids,http://www.parenting.com/article/starting-baby-solids,"Once your baby is ready to start solids (generally somewhere between four to six months of age, although the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first six months), you may wonder just what kinds of foodand how much of itto give your baby in addition to her regular diet of breast milk or infant formula. While the U.S. Department of Agriculture has created a  food pyramid for preschoolers (ages 2 to 5)  and another one for  grade schoolers (ages 6 to 11) , there is no baby food pyramid, which may leave parents confused about what exactly they should be feeding their baby. Fruits and Veggies We spoke with Dr. Alan Greene, a pediatrician at Stanford University's Lucile Packard Children Hospital and author of  Feeding Baby Green: The Earth-Friendly Program for Healthy, Safe Nutrition , who says that while there isnt a specific ratio of veggies, fruits, grains, and proteins that parents should try to feed their babies each day, it  is  important to ensure that a variety of foods are being offered regularly. Dr. Greene says that he encourages parents to first expose their babies to many different kinds of fruits and vegetables, aiming for something green at every lunch and dinner. Rice Cereal and Other Grains As for rice cereal, traditionally a first food for many babies, Dr. Greene has launched the  WhiteOut campaign  to get it off store shelves altogether. He refers to the processed white rice cereal as a gateway junk food, and recommends a whole grain like brown rice or oatmeal instead. But, he says, I do really like the idea of the first bite being something colorful they can see, touch, smell, and recognize from a produce aisle or farmer's market, and suggests foods like avocado, banana, or cooked sweet potato as other options for babys first food. Protein and Meat Meat can be introduced any time after 6 months. While babies dont specifically require meat in their diet, Dr. Greene explains that the AAP recommends it as an early food because of its iron content. Poultry, fish and beef can be offered anywhere from a couple of times a week to a daily basis, but babies can also get all the nutrients they need in the first year from breast milk/formula and other protein- and iron-rich foods too if parents dont eat meat.  The key is not to get caught up in counting servings but to explore different flavors, smells, and textures during this period of introduction to solid food to head off picky eating habits, says Dr. Greene. Reminder: dont give your baby honey until at least one year of age because the risk of botulism, or any raw or undercooked food, unpasteurized cheese, or anything that could be a choking hazard. Plus:  Easy Homemade Baby Food Recipes    Baby Utensils for Starting Solids  Biodiversity Checklist: Want to raise a really adventurous eater? In  Feeding Baby Green ,Dr. Greene includes a biodiversity checklist, listing examples of foods from 21 different families of plants, and suggesting that parents offer at least one from each food family anywhere between 12 to 16 times during the different stages of feeding (spoon feeding, finger foods, and fork/spoon). Heres a taste of his suggestions: Mushrooms: shitake and crimini Amaranths: spinach, quinoa Umbrellifers: carrot, celery, cumin, parsley Cruciferous vegetables: broccoli, cabbage, cauliflower Bromeliads: pineapple Composites: artichokes, lettuces Bindweeds: sweet potato Gourds: canteloupe, cucumber, pumpkin Heath plants: blueberry, cranberry Legumes: black beans, chickpeas, pinto beans Lilies: asparagus, garlic, onion Woody trees: bananas and plantains Sesames: sesame oil, tahini True grasses: brown rice, corn, wheat Rosy plants: apple, apricot, peach, pear, strawberry Citrus plants: grapefruit, lemon, orange Nightshades: eggplant, red bell pepper, Yukon gold potato Grapes: currants, grapes, raisins, Laurels: avocados, cinnamon Myrtles: allspice, guava Loosestrifes: pomegranate Plus:  Easy Homemade Baby Food Recipes    Baby Utensils for Starting Solids  Supplementation: Vitamin D and Iron Although Dr. Greene explains that breast milk is the perfect food, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that breastfed babies should receive a supplement of 400 IU (international units) of vitamin D daily, because it is the one critical nutrient that breast milk often cannot provide enough of (because mothers bodies dont make enough of it, given how relatively little time we spend outdoors in direct sunlight nowadays). Formula-fed babies who consume less than one liter of formula per day (about 34 ounces) should also receive supplementation. Finally, while healthy, full-term babies are born with sufficient iron for their first four months, the American Academy of Pediatrics now advises parents of exclusively or partially breastfed babies to give 1 mg per kilogram of body weight of an oral iron supplement per day starting at 4 months of age and continuing until iron-rich complementary foods are introduced. (Formula-fed babies receive sufficient iron from formula.) Babies 6 to 12 months of age need 11mg of iron per day. Preterm babies who are breastfed should receive an iron supplement of 2 mg/kg daily by 1 month of age and continue until they receive sufficient iron through complementary foods or are weaned to iron-fortified formula.

 12 Tips For a Healthy Pregnancy,http://www.parenting.com/article/12-tips-healthy-pregnancy,"1. Call to Schedule Your First Prenatal Medical Visit If you conceived fairly easily and youre in good general health, your first prenatal check-up will probably not be for several weeks. If youre considered at high risk of problems, it may be sooner. At that first visit, your obstetrician, midwife, or family doctor will check your blood pressure, weigh you, figure out your due date, test for various infections that could harm your baby, do a urine analysis, monitor any previous health problems you might have, perform an internal pelvic exam, and do a Pap test, if you havent had one recently. 2. Let Your Fertility Specialist Know the Treatment Worked If youve used assisted reproduction, your specialist will probably want to see you immediately. He or she may monitor the very earliest stage of your pregnancy. For instance, the infertility specialist may want to schedule an ultrasound to check on the babys development. He or she may also prescribe medications or hormone supplements, depending on the cause of your infertility. In most IVF cases, there are specific medications which will be required through the initial period of pregnancy, the most common being progesterone supplementation, says Lee C. Kao, M.D., Ph.D., co-director of the Center for Reproductive Medicine at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. 3. Have Your Medications Checked Out Certain medications taken by a mother can harm a developing fetus. For example, the acne drug Accutane, the psoriasis drugs Tegison and Soriatane, and several blood pressure medications can cause birth defects or low birth weight. Ideally, you should have spoken to your doctor before conceiving regarding any medications you take, but if you havent already done so, do it now. Dont forget to mention any herbal supplements or megadoses of vitamins you take; some of these can cause pregnancy problems, too. 4. Start Taking a Daily Prenatal Vitamin Containing Folic Acid Studies show that folic acid, a B vitamin, helps prevent birth defects of the brain and spinal cord if taken early in pregnancy, when the babys neural tube is developing. Begin taking a vitamin with folic acid as soon as you know youre pregnant, or even better, start taking it while youre trying to conceive and continue it throughout your pregnancy. These vitamins are available by prescription and over-the-counter. According to the March of Dimes, if all women took adequate folic acid supplementation400 micrograms every daystarting before conception and continuing throughout the first several months of pregnancy, the number of babies born with a neural tube defect could drop by as much as 70 percent. Folic acid is also found in foods such as lentils, asparagus, spinach, black beans, peanuts, orange juice, enriched breads and pasta, romaine lettuce, and broccoli, but the best way to ensure that youre getting enough is to take a supplement. 5. Pay Attention to How Much You Eat You will need to eat for two, but that doesnt mean you can load up on junk food. If you are at a normal weight when you conceive, you should gain between 25 and 35 pounds during pregnancy. That translates to about 300 extra calories a daythe equivalent of a glass of skim milk, a piece of fruit, and a slice of whole-wheat bread. (Calcium is more important than ever during pregnancy, so try to spend some of those extra calories on calcium-rich foods such as milk, cheese, and yogurt.) If you are overweight prior to conception you should gain no more than 15 to 25 pounds, and if you are underweight, you should gain no less than 28 to 40 pounds. 6. Pay Attention to What You Eat Certain foods can put your baby at risk. To be safe, avoid fish that may contain high levels of mercury (swordfish, shark king mackerel, and tilefish); eat no more than six ounces of albacore tuna per week; avoid raw fish, undercooked meat and eggs, and unpasturized cheese, fruit juice, and milk; eat sprouts only if they are cooked; and either stay away from cold cuts and hot dogs or make sure theyre cooked thoroughly before you eat them. 7. Cut Down on Caffeine Excessive caffeine intake may increase the risk of miscarriage, so ingest no more than 300 mg of caffeine a daythe amount of caffeine found in approximately two 8-ounce cups of coffee or two cups of tea per day. 8. Eliminate Alcohol Drinking during pregnancy can cause physical and mental birth defects. We dont know how much alcohol is harmful, so the best advice is to drink none at all, advises Siobhan Dolan, M.D., assistant medical director of the March of Dimes. 9. Stop Smoking and Using Recreational Drugs They put your baby at risk for birth defects, premature birth, and death. 10. Use Caution Around Chemicals Avoid solvents, paints, paint thinners, pesticides, and chemicals such as mercury, benzene, and formaldehyde, which can cause birth defects or miscarriage. And stay away from the cats litter box to avoid exposure to toxoplasmosis. 11. Get an OK for Exercise If you exercised before conceiving, its probably fine for you to continue the same exercise programbut be sure to check with your doctor first in case you have special medical problems that preclude exercise. If you are otherwise healthy, your doctor will probably give you the thumbs-up to keep walking, jogging, swimming, doing yoga, taking low-impact aerobics classes, or doing other moderate exercise. If youve been sedentary, however, nows not the time to take up a vigorous new sport. Ease into exercise with short walks or gentle yoga, provided your doctor approves. 12. Use Your Own Good Judgment If youre worried that something you do might cause a miscarriage, even if your doctor says it wontjogging, for example, or drinking coffee with breakfastthen dont do it. You need to be able to look at yourself in the mirror and say, I did everything I could to sustain this pregnancy, says Gilbert Haas, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist at the Center for Reproductive Health in Oklahoma City. Even if its not a high-risk pregnancy, it is a precious pregnancy. You need to be able to not blame yourself if something goes wrong.

 Ask Dr. Sears: From Bottle Back to Breast,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-from-bottle-back-to-breast,"Q. Soon after my daughter was born, I started bottle-feeding her with expressed breast  milk  because breastfeeding was very painful for me. I have decided to try nursing again, but I'm worried I made a mistake by switching from breast, to bottle and now back to breast again. Is this harmful to my milk supply? And will switching back and forth confuse my daughter? A.  Congratulations on your decision to try breastfeeding again. It often takes a mother and baby at least a couple weeks of exclusive breastfeeding to establish a feeding rhythm that's comfortable for Mom and produces enough milk for baby. I want to reassure you that it's worth attempting to overcome whatever obstacles you may encounter to establish a good breastfeeding relationship. New studies have shown that the length and frequency babies are breastfed correlates with the high cognitive skills and good health they experience as they grow. While it's true that your daughter may have initially been confused by the breast-to-bottle back-and-forth, you certainly need not worry that she has been harmed in any lasting way. What's important is that she was still getting your pumped breast milk. To get back to exclusive breastfeeding and lessen the use of supplemental bottles, try the following: Teach baby a comfortable latch-on.  Are you allowing baby to put too much sucking pressure on the nipple, rather than the areola (the darkened area surrounding your nipples)? This is the most common cause of painful nursing and may be why you've encountered problems. You need to get baby to open her mouth as wide as possible. Use your index finger to depress her lower jaw. When her mouth is open wide, quickly offer the breast while ensuring that her lips and gums are putting sucking pressure above your nipple. This not only makes latch-on less painful for you, but allows baby to get the most milk. Another problem may be that baby's lips are tight or pursed while she nurses. This can lead to sore nipples. Try the ""lower lip flip,"" a trick my wife (a lactation consultant) used on our babies. Once your daughter is latched on, take your index finger and flip her lower lip outward. This, in combination with baby's wide open mouth, should increase your comfort and nursing success. Get consultation.  It's now common for pediatric practices to have a lactation specialist either in their office or on call. Consider getting a positioning and latch-on consultation now, before any uncomfortable nursing habits develop -- it may be one of the most worthwhile things you do as a new parent. Gradually lessen the number of bottles.  Once you've established an optimal milk supply and a comfortable latch-on, the occasional supplemental bottle is fine. However, I discourage supplemental bottle use unless absolutely necessary, as I find switching between breast and bottle can sometimes causes ""nipple confusion,"" especially during the first month of life. When bottle-feeding, baby can suck any old way she wants and the milk still flows freely. If she's latching onto your breast, on the other hand, she must do it correctly in order to get fed -- thus the confusion. If out of necessity you must combo feed, try to hold off until your baby is past the newborn stage. Once she's older, the likelihood of nipple confusion will greatly decrease. Think milk!  Breastfeeding can be thought of as a confidence game. While nursing your baby, visualize your milk flowing. Imagine your baby properly latching-on and enjoying your milk, and imagine yourself enjoying your ability to nourish your child. It's amazing how focusing on these positive, motherly thoughts can help you produce more milk. You may find our book,  The Breastfeeding Book"
 Complementary and Alternative Medicine for Common Kid Problems,http://www.parenting.com/article/alternative-medicine-children,"What if your pediatrician handed you a prescription for honey instead of an antibiotic? Sweet! While Western medicine has lots of tools at its disposal to treat children, it's not the only option, and more doctors and parents are recognizing this. As many as 40 percent of kids today have received some form of complementary or alternative medicine (CAM). These treatments include oils, yoga, and probiotics. It's all about integrating complementary therapies that are safe and effective with conventional therapies that are safe and effective, says Lawrence Rosen, M.D., chair of the American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Complementary and Integrative Medicine and a pediatrician in Oradell, NJ. The one caveat: There isn't a lot of scientific research out there for alternative treatments, so parents should use common sense, says Kathi Kemper, M.D., director of the Center for Integrative Medicine at Wake Forest Baptist Health. You don't need to ask a doctor before using chicken soup or giving your child a massage, but do ask about starting a new herbal remedy, she advises. Since these supplements are not regulated, Dr. Kemper recommends always choosing products labeled with a USP sealfrom the United States Pharmacopeiawhich verifies the quantity and quality. How to use CAM treatments wisely: Issue :  Upset stomach Treatment:   Probiotics Ages:  All ages What it does:  Probiotics can shorten the life of stomach bugs and reduce antibiotic side effects like diarrhea. Dr. Rosen typically recommends an over-the-counter probiotic supplement like Florastor Kids or Culturelle. Consult your doctor about dosage. Issue: ADHD Treatment:  Yoga Ages:  3 and up What it does:  There's no single magic bullet for ADHD, but for many kids, a mind-body technique like yoga gives them a way to move their body and develop breathing strategies that can help them focus and relax, says Dr. Rosen. Issue: Earache Treatment:  Garlic oil eardrops Ages:  6 months and up What it does:  Garlic and olive oil are anti-inflammatories that can help ease the pain of an earache, says Dr. Rosen. Create your own drops by mixing one tablespoon room-temperature olive oil with one clove of crushed garlic. Put two to three drops in the affected ear every four hours as needed for pain. Contact your doctor if your child develops a fever, there's fluid coming out of the ear, or if the earache gets worse after 48 hours. Issue: Stress-related headache or stomachache Treatment:  Biofeedback Ages:  5 and up What it does:  During a session, the child is connected to electrical sensors while the doctor teaches him breathing and relaxing skills to help ease pain. As the child alters his behavior, he sees the changes show up on a screen, much like in a video game."
 Germs and Kids,http://www.parenting.com/article/germs-and-kids,"It's understandable that parents want to keep their children's environments clean, especially when kids are young. Moms wash bottles in hot water, clean pacifiers that fall on the ground, and take dirty things out of their kids' mouths. But overall, when it comes to germs, most people have it backward: With relatively few exceptions, they are good for our kids. Keeping things clean is smart, but going crazy using antibacterial hand soaps, buying antibacterial kids' toys and other products, and overusing antibiotic medications is actually killing off the microbes that can help strengthen the immune system. Antibacterial products may help to reduce some infections, but they also promote the growth of drug-resistant organisms and weaken the good bacteria within us. Rather than focus on killing germs, we need to think about how to encourage their growth. Supporting the right bacteria can have a huge health payoff for your kids: fewer ear infections, tummy aches, episodes of diarrhea, urinary-tract infections, and food allergies. It can even help kids fight off coughs, colds, and fevers. Here's how to ensure your kids have enough of the good stuff: Feed your kids right.  Give them foods that naturally contain helpful organisms. These include yogurt, pickles, dark chocolate, and feta cheese. In some cases , it may be useful to give a probiotic supplement (available at most pharmacies and health-food stores) containing beneficial live bacteria. All of these foods and supplements are fine to give kids starting at around 6 months. There are other foods to include in their diet that don't actually contain good germs but help to nurture them: garlic, onions, asparagus, whole oats, whole wheat, honey (for children over age 1), and bananas. Make safe and smart choices.  Keep your kids away from cigarette smoke; exposure can kill off favorable bacteria. As for antibiotic drugs, don't insist that your pediatrician prescribe them when he says they're not necessary. These drugs eliminate both good and bad bacteria. If your kids do have to take antibiotics, make sure they get probiotics, too, to restore the body's supply of good bacteria. Keeping the body's bacteria in balance doesn't take a lot of effort, but it can have big benefits. Starting these habits young can help keep kids healthy for life."
 Soothing News About Pacifiers,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/stephanie-wood/breastfeeding-paci,"Binky fans, rejoice! Increasing evidence is showing that breastfeeding and paci sucking can co-exist. The latest proof, just published yesterday in the journal  Pediatrics:  A study of more than 2,200 newborns out of the Department of Pediatrics at Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) in Portland found that after a hospital stopped routinely handing out pacifiers, exclusive breastfeeding rates actually decreased. Conversely, exclusive and supplemental formula feeding rates increased. Prior to the binky ban, during which pacifiers were placed in literal lockdown and nurses had to enter a code to retrieve one, 80 percent of babies born at the hospital were exclusively breastfed. After the ban, that number dropped to 70 percent. The irony here is that the hospital took this step to receive a Baby-Friendly designation. The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative (babyfriendlyusa.org) was created to encourage and recognize hospitals that offer optimal support and care for breastfeeding mothers and their newborns. To receive the designation, hospitals must meet 10 criteria, one of which is give no pacifiers or artificial nipples to breastfeeding infants. Its long been debated whether pacifier use interferes with the establishment of breastfeeding, particularly in the early weeks. Lactation enthusiasts tend to support this thinking, insisting that pacifier use (along with supplemental baby bottles) can cause nipple confusion and interfere with the development of proper latch-on and suckling technique. Not only would plenty of parents and researchers disagree, but pacifier use has also been shown to have some important benefits in recent years. Plus:  One Mom's Love-Hate Relationship With Pacifiers This subject poses an additional dilemma for parents and pediatric providers as pacifier use is associated with a decreased risk of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS), and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using a pacifier for sleep after breastfeeding is established, notes study author Laura Kair, M.D., pediatric resident at OHSUs Doernbecher Childrens Hospital where the research was conducted. Our goal with publicizing this data is to stimulate conversation and scientific inquiry about whether there is sufficient evidence to support the universal recommendation of not offering pacifiers to breastfeeding infants in the first few days to weeks of life. Did your breastfed baby use a pacifier as well?  Let us know ."

,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/project-pregnancy/first-prenatal-appointment,"We had our first appointment! I was pretty psyched about it. Finally, real confirmation from a medical professional that I'm pregnant. And thankfully it went well. It was definitely interesting, though, having my husband in the exam room with me while I was practically naked with a speculum sticking out of me. But hey, he's going to have to see a lot worse in the coming months, so I figured he might as well start getting used to it now. My obgyn went over the schedule of exams I'll have, the genetic tests we may want to get (we do), and she answered my questions (yes, I can get a doula; no, she doesn't really have much advice for quelling nausea, etc.). But she didn't know a whole lot about nutrition, I have to say. I thought that the prenatal vitamin she'd prescribed me earlier didn't have enough nutrients (I did a lot of research on different brands and I asked a few nutritionists too). I also told her that in addition to the prenatal vitamin, I wanted to take a calcium supplement and a  DHA supplement  (fatty acids that have been shown to promote brain development, among other things). ""I don't think I've seen a pregnant woman who was calcium deficient,"" she said, ""but it's fine if you want to supplement with it."" Um, you've never seen a pregnant woman who needs more calcium? I've had friends who ruined their teeth and developed weak bones as a result of not getting enough calcium during pregnancy and breastfeeding. And what about the old wives' tale that a woman loses a tooth for every pregnancy? I'm pretty sure my obgyn has seen more pregnant women than I have, so how come I've heard of this calcium issue and she's not concerned? I couldn't even muster the energy to be annoyed, though, because she was helpful and listened to me, and I like her demeanor enough. And she did prescribe me another brand of prenatal vitamins, which I'd heard good things about. The prenatal she prescribed (and I'm taking), by the way, is  Citracal , which has lots of the nutrients pregnant women need and it comes with a 250 mg pill of DHA from a non-fish source. Since neurologists and nutritionists (including my friends Lyssie Lakatos, R.D., and Tammy Lakatos-Shames, R.D., who are known as  ""The Nutrition Twins""  ) recommend  at least  400 mg per day of DHA in order to boost brain development, I'm also taking an additional 200 mg DHA pill each day called  Expecta , which my pharmacist gave me. And the Nutrition Twins do agree that I should supplement with calcium. So, for future nutrition questions, I plan to get my info from nutritionists (and then just clear it with my doc). But, anyway, the most exciting part of the appointment was that we had our very first sonogram. We couldn't see much, but we did see the flickering white light that signified the heartbeat. Pretty amazing. ""It's a good strong, heartbeat,"" said my obgyn. ""That doesn't mean that you won't have a miscarriage at this point, but it means that things are looking good."" I was a little put off by the mention of the ""M"" word right then, but I appreciated the straight facts. ""If the heartbeat is still strong at your 10-week check-up, you'll only have a 5 percent chance of miscarriage at that point,"" she added. Okay, then, let's get to week 10. Then, she handed us a printed copy of our sonogram. ""It's cute,"" my husband said. When I got back to work, I promptly made photocopies of the sonogram for our parents and my brother and sister-in-law, and sent them off in the mail titled, ""First Sonogram, Baby Pechman."" I felt a little presumptuous writing ""baby,"" since at this point the embryo isn't even called a fetus yet, and a lot could happen between now and then. But, I don't know, I was feeling optimistic. I still am."
 Robots in the Classroom,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/mom-congress/jill-parenting/robots-classroom,"Its always funny to watch those old shows and movies depicting what society would be like in the far off 21 st Century. While we havent created flying cars just yet, nor perfected our galaxy hopping abilities, we have created something just as crazy to comprehend (at least for me)  robots that can teach kids foreign languages, household tasks, and social skills. According to a recent New York Times article , the most advanced models of these robots are equipped with motion tracking and speech recognition softwares, which allow them to simulate the way teachers teach. And they do a pretty good job.At the University of California at San Diego, a robot was used to teach Finnish to preschoolers. The preschoolers who were taught by the robot scored higher on language tests than preschoolers taught with less interactive learning strategies like tapes. When compared to being taught by a human teacher, however, the preschoolers scores were about the same. In some countries, these robots have already been put to the test in the classroom. South Korea is in the process of  hiring robots to teach English, and to serve as teachers aides and classroom playmates. While computer scientists say that robots wont be able to replace human teachers altogether (whew!), they do have high hopes for their ability to supplement learning in the classroom. So what do you think  are these things cool or just plain freaky?"
 How to Get a Deal on Life Insurance,http://www.parenting.com/article/how-to-get-a-deal-on-life-insurance,"""Most new parents have a 'holy cow!' moment when they realize they now have this little financial dependent,"" says David Woods, president of the Life and  Health  Insurance Foundation for Education. You know life insurance is a good idea, but buying it can be easily pushed aside in the fog of diaper changes and sleepless nights. Luckily, it's not as complicated, or as expensive, as you may think. Consider term insurance.  ""Term life insurance is an affordable choice for young parents on a tight budget,"" says Woods. Expect to pay $60 to $80 per month for a $1 million policy. Unlike permanent (or whole) life insurance, term protects for the specific period of time you choose, such as until your child graduates from college. Buy only what you need.  Plan to cover funeral expenses and debts, as well as future obligations, like college. For a rough estimate, use the life insurance calculator at  life-line.org Shop around.

 4 Ways to Choose the Right Multivitamin,http://www.parenting.com/article/4-ways-to-choose-the-right-multivitamin,"As if choosing a multivitamin from the endless options at the drugstore isn't confusing enough, a report from  consumerlabs.com  has found that 30 percent of the multivitamins the company tested had significantly more or less of some ingredients than the products claimed. Here's some advice you can safely swallow. 100 percent is plenty.  ""Those that offer 300 percent aren't any more helpful,"" says Elizabeth Ward, RD, author of  Expect the Best: Your Guide to Healthy Eating Before, During & After Pregnancy . Look for the ""USP verified"" symbol.  It's not a guarantee, but supplements that have been approved by the U.S. Pharmacopeia, a nonprofit health agency, are typically of good quality. Consider a prescription prenatal.  Folic acid and iron are particularly crucial nutrients for women who are in the process of trying to get pregnant, the group that prenatals are tailored to. Eat smart.  ""Our bodies absorb nutrients best from food,"" says Ward. ""A diet with lots of fruits, vegetables, lean protein and whole grains is always your best bet."""
 3 Ways to Ease PMS,http://www.parenting.com/article/3-ways-to-ease-pms,"If you're cramping up more than ever, it's probably no surprise to hear that PMS can feel worse post-kids, especially if you've switched -- or stopped -- contraceptives. ""When you stop taking birth control and start ovulating, you could get hit with the PMS symptoms the Pill was suppressing,"" says Linda Bradley, M.D., with the Cleveland Clinic. Check out the latest on how to deal: Yoga Practicing yoga can significantly improve the psychological and physical symptoms of PMS, according to a study from India. Yoga provides exercise, relaxation, and stress management -- all things that can ease your monthly misery. Dairy & calcium Taking in 600 mg of calcium (about a glass of milk and a cup of yogurt) twice a day could cut premenstrual fatigue, cravings, and low moods in half, reports a recent Columbia University study. Supplements work, too; pop one with vitamin D for better absorption. Antidepressants Women with moderate to severe PMS may benefit from low doses of sertraline (Zoloft) in the two weeks before their periods, says research in the  Journal of Clinical Psychiatry . If you're really suffering and just not able to function normally, it can't hurt to ask your doctor about it."
 Why does my baby have discolored or gray teeth?,http://www.parenting.com/article/why-does-my-baby-have-discolored-or-gray-teeth,"There are lots of possible reasons for gray-looking teeth. Did you take tetracycline or a similar antibiotic when you were pregnant? Doing so can affect the fetus's teeth and cause  stains  when they erupt.  The discoloration could also be due to trauma to the mouth. ther possible culprits are poor dental hygiene (you should brush your daughter's teeth regularly as soon as they come in), food stains, past infections, and medications she's taken, such as liquid iron supplements. Some liver and blood diseases can also cause teeth to look gray. And while it's rare, problems with tooth enamel can sometimes be the explanation.  Bottom line: Talk to your doctor to figure out the cause.

 How do I make sure my child is getting enough fluoride?,http://www.parenting.com/article/how-do-i-make-sure-my-child-is-getting-enough-fluoride,"Fluoride is important for teeth and bone health. Adding it to the public water supply has been shown to  help  reduce the number of cavities children get.  That doesn't mean your kids aren't getting enough of the mineral, though. Many foods and drinks today are made with water that contains fluoride, so your children may be consuming enough of it to compensate. There's fluoride in their toothpaste, and fluoride treatments are part of a routine dentist's visit. In fact, getting too much fluoride can damage and discolor the enamel on unerupted teeth.  To be sure, have your water tested by an expert to see how much fluoride is in it -- check with your local water department or department of public health for details -- and then talk to your doctor.

 Hemorrhoids During Pregnancy,http://www.parenting.com/article/hemorrhoids-during-pregnancy,"Most women would like to pretend that hemorrhoids do not exist. But during pregnancy, they may crop up or become more severe if you're already suffering.  Symptoms  include bleeding, itching, and soreness in the rectal area. Hemorrhoids (also called piles) occur when rectal veins swell due to increased pressure. ""During pregnancy, hemorrhoids are caused by the sheer weight of the uterus on the veins,"" says Lisa Domagalski, M.D. FACOG, an ob-gyn at Women and Infants Hospital in Rhode Island and assistant clinical instructor at Brown University. Constipation, often a problem since pregnancy slows down the gastrointestinal tract, can exacerbate hemorrhoids. The key to preventing constipation is to drink plenty of water and eat at least two grams of fiber every day -- good sources include bran cereal, apples, and spinach. Your doctor may recommend fiber supplements or stool softeners. To get relief, cleanse with witch hazel pads (Tucks) after a bowel movement, soak in a warm sitz bath, apply an ice pack, and avoid sitting on hard surfaces. Ask your doctor about trying over-the-counter creams, such as Preparation H Hydrocortisone 1% Anti-Itch Cream, that temporarily relieve itch and inflammation. In rare cases, painful blood clots, called thrombosed hemorrhoids, can form inside the veins. If this happens, you'll need to have them surgically removed in a minor procedure before your delivery. But there is good news: ""Hemorrhoids do get better after delivery,"" Domagalski says. ""They can shrink considerably or totally disappear."""
 Iron-Clad Nutrition,http://www.parenting.com/article/iron-clad-nutrition-21354364,"During pregnancy a woman's daily requirement for iron doubles, from 15 to 30 milligrams -- and no wonder: Iron is a major component of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen throughout the body and to the placenta. It also enables both mother and fetus to form new red blood cells. Getting enough iron becomes especially important in the second and third trimesters, when maternal blood volume increases and the fetus begins to store the mineral for the first few months after birth. A shortage of iron can leave an expectant mom tired, pale, and infection-prone. If you have a deficiency, your doctor may prescribe an iron supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamin. However, you should still aim to eat at least four or five servings of iron-rich foods each day. For an extra boost, preparing foods in cast-iron cookware can increase their iron content. You can also enhance your body's absorption of iron by pairing foods containing iron with a source of vitamin C (a snack of raisins and orange juice, a tomato-and-ground beef pasta sauce), and combining meat sources of iron with nonmeat sources (as in beef-and-bean chili). Because the tannin in tea and the polyphenols in coffee can interfere with iron absorption, avoid drinking them with meals."
 Health Update: Nutrient Rich Nuts,http://www.parenting.com/article/nutrient-rich-nuts,"For a health boost, grab a handful of nuts. They're high in fiber, protein, and some surprising nutrients. Case in point: Just two Brazil nuts (about a quarter of an ounce) deliver as much of the cell-protecting antioxidant selenium as a supplement, according to a new study. Nuts are high in fat (though it's the healthy kind), so avoid packing on the pounds by treating them as a condiment instead of a snack. Sprinkle them on salads and cereal, or toss with steamed veggies, suggests Sarah Krieger, spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. Check out how some other nuts stack up per one-ounce serving: 12-16 walnut halves  = 200 percent of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of omega-3, an essential fatty acid (175 calories)  20-24 whole almonds  = 35 percent of the RDA of vitamin E, which counters cholesterol (163 calories)  25-30 pecan halves  = 10 percent of your daily fiber needs, plus a healthy dose of oleic acid, a cholesterol-fighting fat (196 calories)."
 Dealing with Baby Diarrhea,http://www.parenting.com/article/baby-diarrhea,"Too much poop can be tough to spot in tiny tots. What to watch for? Stools so loose they sink into the diaper, says Jolanda White, M.D., a pediatric gastroenterologist at Columbus Children's Hospital in Ohio. Here's the lowdown on what's up with all that doo-doo: When to call the doc:  Anytime a baby younger than 2 months has diarrhea, when you see blood in the stools, or when the diarrhea lasts more than eight hours. Be on the lookout for dehydration; the first clue is fewer wet diapers. If you see a sunken soft spot, head for the E.R. How to treat it:  Continue to nurse or give your baby an over-the-counter electrolyte solution (hold off on cow's-milk formula). For ongoing baby diarrhea from antibiotics, some doctors recommend a probiotic supplement. What to feed:  When appetite returns, offer babies eating solids a binding BRAT diet (bananas, rice, applesauce, toast), yogurt that contains live cultures (such as Stonyfield Farms), and low-fat protein, like baked chicken."
 High Radiation in Japan May Harm Unborn Babies the Most,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/lauren-parentingcom/high-radiation-japan-may-harm-unborn-babies-most,"With the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear reactors malfunctioning after the earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the exact levels of radiation are unknown. But some worry that pregnant women in the area  aren't receiving enough information  about what the radiation could do to their unborn babies. According to the Wall street Journal , a high dose of radiation can cause a miscarriage within the first 14 days of pregnancy. For fetuses that survive, the Centers for Disease Control says that exposure between weeks 2 and 15 is most dangerous and can result in birth defects, brain damage and stunted growth. After the 16th week of pregnancy, the fetus is less sensitive, and a woman would have to be exposed to as much radiation as 5,000 chest x-rays to produce the same problems. Experts urge pregnant women to take iodine supplements and eat only non-contaminated food to reduce the risk of birth defects. But a  halt to shipments on things like spinach and milk  hint that the detection of high levels of radioactivity in foods is something the Japanese government is battling. A tragic story all around, and one whose consequences well likely be seeing for a long time to come."
 Preventing Preeclampsia,http://www.parenting.com/article/preventing-preeclampsia,"If you're pregnant or trying, new research may  help  you reduce your risk of preeclampsia. The condition, which is marked by swelling and dangerously high blood pressure, affects up to 8 percent of pregnancies and is a leading cause of early inductions and c-sections. What to consider: Aspirin News flash:  Women at risk for preeclampsia who take aspirin are 10 percent less likely to develop it and deliver before 34 weeks, according to a review of studies in  The Lancet . Whom it could help:  Those with high blood pressure, diabetes, or a personal or family history of preeclampsia. Aspirin isn't advised for healthy pregnant women. How much and when:  A daily low dose (50 to 150 mg), starting whenever your doctor thinks it's appropriate during your pregnancy. Vitamin D News flash:  A University of Pittsburgh study shows that women who don't get enough of the vitamin are up to five times more likely to develop preeclampsia. Whom it could help:  All women. It's especially vital for those with dark skin, who tend to be the most vitamin D-deficient (dark skin needs more sunlight to synthesize the vitamin). How much and when:  Experts say 1,000 to 2,000 IUs is ideal. Take a daily D3 vitamin supplement (which is more effective than D2) early in your pregnancy."
 A Four-Day School Week?,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/mom-congress/kathryn-young-thompson/four-day-school-week,"What would you do if your school district announced that it would be dealing with budget cuts by moving to a four-day school week? My first thought is  Move. My second is  Supplement with homeschool. But for a lot of Americans, neither of these are options. So Im left wondering what parents should do as they watch their childrens educational opportunities get slashed. The Irene-Wakonda School District in South Dakota  recently announced that it would be cutting Friday instruction  this year for financial reasons. And theyre not the only ones. According to a recent news article, more than 120 school districts in 20 states, most in the west, now use four-day weeks. This number seems surprisingly high. The deeper I get into the world of education advocacy, the more I hear educators, administrators and parents pushing for longer hours in school, not shorter. President Obama has advocated for  extending the school year , saying that children in the United States attend classes, on average, about a month less per yearthan children in most other advanced nations.  Click here to see a map  that compares the length of a school year in various countries around the world. At a time when Americans are fighting to make our schools more competitive internationally, it seems completely counterproductive to be giving kids less time in school. As a nation, we show our priorities by how we spend our tax dollars. What does shortening the school week tell our kids about what we value?

 Study: Most New Moms Do Not Breastfeed as Long as Planned,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/sasha-parentingcom/study-most-new-moms-do-not-breastfeed-long-they-planned,"Almost two-thirds of pregnant women who have the goal of breastfeeding exclusively for the first three months of their babys life dont achieve it,  according to a new study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention . The study, published in the July issue of  Pediatrics , found that 42 percent of moms who planned to nurse had switched to formula in the first month, a third of them by the time they got home from the hospital. The World Health Organization and the American Academy of Pediatrics recommend that moms breastfeed exclusively for about 6 months. Plus: 15 Products That Make Breastfeeding Easier The study followed about 1,500 women before and after the birth of their baby, and included only moms of healthy babies. New moms who were obese, smoked or had a goal to breastfeed longer than 6 months were less likely to meet their goal. Married moms and non-first-time moms were more likely to nurse as long as they planned. Also, hospital practices seem to have a strong effect. Nursing within an hour of birth, rooming in, nursing on demand, getting lactation support and avoiding pacifiers all increased a new moms chances of making her breastfeeding goal (however,  another recent study found pacis dont have a negative effect ). The biggest indicator of success was not supplementing with formula in the hospital. Plus: Where Breastfeeding is the Law Did you breastfeed as long as you wanted to?

 Kids Vitamins Not as Healthy as Labeled,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/sasha-parentingcom/kids-vitamins-not-healthy-labeled,"You really cant believe everything you read.

 Understanding Growth Charts,http://www.parenting.com/article/growth-charts,"Pediatricians are using two completely different growth chartsone developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and another by the World Health Organization (WHO). Who knew? The one your doc chooses could make your baby seem too big or too small. Fear notJennifer Trachtenberg, M.D., pediatrician and author of The Smart Parent's Guide , sorts it out: Q: Why two growth charts? A: The CDC chart is based on American babies, most of whom are formula-fed. The current WHO chart represents breastfed babies in six different countries as of 2006. Docs previously used the CDC chart, but now the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends using the WHO one for kids under 2 years old. Q: So why the change? A: We now know that breastfed babies grow faster in the first three months and then slower through age 1. So on the CDC chart, breastfed babies suddenly fell off the normal curve. Doctors would see this drop and suggest supplementing, but that was a faulty conclusion. Q: What are pediatricians looking for in these charts? A: Your baby doesn't need to be in the 50th percentile across the board. Doctors just want a child to stay relatively on the same path from visit to visit without big variations up or down."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Treating Anemia,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-treating-anemia,"Q. Our baby has anemia. What causes it -- and how can we keep him  healthy ? A.  Anemia means your baby's number of red blood cells -- which carry oxygen to muscles and vital organs -- is lower than normal. The most common cause of it in babies is an iron-deficient diet. Without enough iron (which helps produce hemoglobin, a protein in these cells), the blood gets ""tired"" and, consequently, so does your baby's body. Iron-deficient anemia may also contribute to cognitive delays, since iron helps the trillions of nerve cells in a baby's rapidly growing brain make the right connections. Anemic babies often have suppressed immune systems as well, which is why they tend to get more colds. Anemia is common between 6 and 9 months, when the extra iron your baby stored up in the womb begins to be used up and must be replaced. While breast milk contains the highest-quality iron of any food, there isn't enough of it in mother's milk, so you may need to ask your doctor about supplementing with iron drops. Bottle-feeders should always use an iron-fortified formula. Cow's milk is low in iron, so the American Academy of Pediatrics recommends waiting until a baby is at least a year old to introduce it into his diet. You can, however, feed him iron-rich foods. The best ones for babies over 6 months: pureed beef, lamb, dark-meat poultry, and iron-fortified cereals."
 The Scoop On Restless Legs Syndrome,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-scoop-on-restless-legs-syndrome,"The first  symptom  describes many kids: trouble  falling and staying asleep . But if your child also complains of heavy-feeling legs, and has an uncontrollable urge to move them frequently during the night, he might have a condition called restless legs syndrome (RLS). As with growing pains, which can wake kids up at night with aches in their legs (often after they've played and run a lot), RLS can wake him up with discomfort, too. But it can also make it hard for a child to settle down at night in the first place. It may take anywhere from 30 minutes to 2 hours to fall asleep. And then he'll wake up repeatedly through the night with a need to move his legs. If you suspect RLS, ask your doctor to test your child's iron levelsabout three-quarters of patients are deficient in the mineral. If your child is, he may need iron supplements. There's also anecdotal evidence that evening exercise may help. Running, skipping, jumpingthat's a treatment a kid'll love!"
 Reality Check: Lowering Gift Expectations,http://www.parenting.com/article/lowering-kids-gift-expectations,"Q. Our kids are used to getting everything they want from Santa, but times are tight. How do we explain that he's going to be short this year without ruining Christmas? A.  When it comes to St. Nick, little kids will believe most anything you tell them: Santa's put a cap on requests this year because he has an elf shortage. As long as there's loot to unwrap, it'll be all good. You can supplement Santa's big toy with lots of inexpensive ones from the bargain bin. (If your kids are anything like mine, they'll probably play with the cheap toys more than the ones you spent the mortgage on anyway!) What's more important, though, is that your kids understand that Christmas is also about the joy and love on such a special day. After my kids inspect their gifts, we make breakfast together and, holiday music blasting, eat as a family, reminding ourselves how blessed we are to have each other in our lives. That's a gift that's much too precious for Santa to carry around in his bag. Tell your children this, remind yourself, too, and let the magic be."
 4 Ways to Protect Your Baby from Food Allergies,http://www.parenting.com/article/4-ways-to-protect-your-baby-from-food-allergies,"Eggs, peanuts, soy milk, oh my! Food allergies are quite common in little ones: One out of every 17 children age 3 and under suffers from them. So what can you do? Start with these facts, tips and suggestions. Know Your Allergens Beware of the most common allergens: cow's milk, egg whites, wheat, peanuts and tree nuts (walnuts, almonds, pecans, cashews), fish and shellfish, and soy. Allergies Can be Hand-Me-Downs Food allergies can be hereditary, hence babies whose parents have allergies are at higher risk for developing them. The good news: Most children outgrow them by 5 years of age. Breastfeed If You Can Some studies have shown that breastfeeding may help protect your baby from developing certain food allergies, particularly if you have a family history of them. If you're not breastfeeding or need to supplement, ask your pediatrician to recommend a formula. Spot the Signs Look for any of the symptoms of an allergic reaction. They include but are not limited to hives, rashes, throat tightness, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, pale skin and lightheadedness.

 Tooth Care for Little Tykes,http://www.parenting.com/article/tooth-care-for-little-tykes,"Before age 6, kids need your direct supervision when they brush and floss, since they lack the motor skills to do them right, says the American Dental Association (ADA). Before the first baby tooth arrives, at around 6 months, you can wipe gums daily with a  clean , damp cloth. But once her pearly whites start to appearshe may have all 20 by her second birthday  brush 'em. 6 months to 2 years Hold a soft, child-size toothbrush at a 45-degree angle; go over eating surfaces and the inside and outside of teeth in a circular motion, half on the gums, half on the teeth. Skip fluoridated paste for now; swallowing too much fluoride can discolor permanent teeth. Use plain water or a fluoride-free toothpaste, such as Orajel Toddler Training Toothpaste. If your water isn't fluoridated, ask your dentist about a supplement. 2 to 4 years Continue to use water or fluoride-free paste until your child can spit into the sink. Then you can use a small amount of fluoridated toothpaste. Around age 4, when back molars are touching, start to floss. Wrap it in a ""C"" shape around each tooth and glide it gently. 4 and up Let your child brush by herself with a soft brush, but follow up. Teach by letting her mimic you. An electric brush, such as the Crest SpinBrush, can help kids brush more easily and give them more gum stimulation. Whether she's using a manual or electric brush, she'll be ready to brush solo about the time she can tie her shoes."
 FDA Revises Prescription Labels for Pregnant & Breastfeeding Women,http://www.parenting.com/pregnancy/health-symptoms/fda-revises-prescription-labels-pregnant-breastfeeding-women,"Out with the old and in with the new. The  United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)  is overhauling the outdated, five-letter system used to inform breastfeeding and pregnancy women about medicine precautions. The  current labeling system  designates each prescription or biologic medication as either a category A, B, C, D, X or N substance. Each category warns of possible risks to a woman trying to get pregnant, is pregnant or  breastfeeding . However, the overly simplistic system is not well understood at a glance. Over the next several years, expect to see new labeling that focuses more on lactation and pregnancy warnings, according to the FDA. Information will include: whether or not the medication is secreted into breast milk how much medication transfers to breast milk the effects the medication can have on a fetus or baby The new labeling will also focus on fertility effects for men and women. The details will include how medication can affect pregnancy testing, birth control effectiveness and the ability to conceive. One word of caution: The new FDA labeling will not be applied to over-the-counter medications, supplements or herbal remedies. If you're trying to conceive, are already pregnant or breastfeeding, talk with your gynecologist or pediatrician about how these medications may affect you and your baby.

 Pump Up The Iron,http://www.parenting.com/article/pump-up-the-iron,"Newborns may be helpless creatures, but most have no trouble pumping  iron  into their diet. For the first four to six months, babies can tap their own natural stores for all the iron they need. Soon after, solid foods, iron-fortified formula, or an iron supplement (for breastfeeding or preterm babies) usually takes up the slack. Nine percent of children between 12 and 36 months, however, are iron-deficient, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. If your baby isn't getting enough iron (pediatricians order a routine blood test between 9 and 12 months), don't panic and start force-feeding iron-rich foods, says Susan Moores, M.S., R.D., spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association. This isn't necessary and, at high levels, can even be toxic. Simply choosing different foods should do the trick. How much is enough? Babies only need 6 to 10 milligrams of iron daily. That's equal to three servings of iron-fortified cereal a day or a jar of baby food with meat and vegetables. In addition, offering foods high in vitamin C-- such as fortified apple juice or a jar of mashed bananas-- will improve the absorption of iron found in fruits, vegetables, breads, and cereals. Some other good choices for introducing a little more iron: Legumes-- mashed peas, lentils, or soybeans Squash or sweet potatoes Iron-fortified bread (for older babies with teeth) Raisins (finely chopped, for older babies with teeth)."
 Formula Firsts,http://www.parenting.com/article/formula-firsts,"Q. My baby is a  healthy  3-month-old who is formula fed because I had several breastfeeding problems. Are the new formulas with DHA and ARA more like breast milk? A.  First, I want to congratulate you for giving breastfeeding a try, and I'm happy to hear that your baby is thriving. While breast milk is preferred infant nutrition, formula manufacturers make every attempt to match the composition of their products as closely as possible to human milk. Over the past few years, attention has been focused on two key ingredients found in human milk-- the fatty acids DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) and ARA (arachidonic acid), which are essential building blocks of brain and eye tissue. Babies get these fatty acids in the womb, from breast milk, and later, from solid foods. They are also made in the body from nutrients found in breast milk and formula, though recent studies have shown that breastfed infants have higher blood concentrations of DHA and ARA than formula-fed infants. Last year U.S. manufacturers began marketing infant formulas that contain DHA and ARA; similar products have been used safely for years in other countries. However, while studies have shown that premature babies benefit from formula supplemented with DHA and ARA, it's not yet clear if full-term infants do. The American Academy of Pediatrics has stated that there is not enough evidence thus far to issue a recommendation on the topic. Since the jury is still out about the benefits of these formulas for full-term babies, right now, it's a personal choice. So talk to your pediatrician to decide what's right for you and your baby."
 Mythbuster: Infant Cereal in Baby's Bottle?,http://www.parenting.com/article/mythbuster-infant-cereal-in-babys-bottle,"What you've heard: It's okay to put  infant  cereal in your baby's bottle The truth: It's not advised except in rare instances, such as when a baby has severe reflux and isn't getting enough calories to grow. ""We're not talking about mildly spitty or gassy babies,"" says Jennifer Shu, M.D., coauthor of  Food Fights: Winning the Nutritional Challenges of Parenthood Armed With Insight, Humor, and a Bottle of Ketchup . Even in the tough cases, first check with your doctor about other options, such as supplementing with extra formula or trying medication, like antacids. ""Babies know how much they need to drink based on volume, so upping the calories in the bottle can cause them to overfeed and become overweight,"" says Dr. Shu. As for giving infant cereal at bedtime to help your baby sleep longer, studies show that it doesn't work. Bottom line: If your baby's old enough to digest solids (between 4 and 6 months), she should be getting them from a spoon.

 Ask Dr. Sears: On a Nursing Strike,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-on-a-nursing-strike,"Q.   My 10-month-old daughter has been refusing to nurse lately. She started eating solids about six weeks ago. I don't give her anything supplemental to drink, hoping she will begin nursing again, but it doesn't seem to be working. She is quite happy to sit in my lap and drink a bottle of my breast  milk , but won't nurse from the breast. It concerns me that she's not getting enough to drink, but I don't want to pump my milk every time she is thirsty. She has a great appetite for food and will cry until we put her in her high chair to eat -- which kills the ""nurse before I feed her"" idea. What can I do? A.  In breastfeeding circles, this annoying quirk is dubbed a ""nursing strike."" It's especially frustrating for nursing mothers who are not yet ready to wean their baby and who believe baby isn't ready to wean either. Nursing strikes are most common following some upset in routine, such as a family trip, a move, a parent changing jobs, or a prolonged separation from one or both parents. But many times it's difficult to pinpoint the reason for the strike. Here are some ways to woo your baby back to breastfeeding: Replay her favorite nursing situations.  To entice your little ""striker"" back to the breast, try to relive her favorite nursing situations, such as nursing in a beloved rocking chair. Sit down in the rocking chair and hold her in the nursing position next to your breast while you thumb through a picture book. This scene may trigger fond memories of nursing and rocking and may encourage her to nurse. When one of our babies went on a nursing strike, what worked was nursing her in the bathtub. My daughter loved taking a bath with my wife and enjoyed nursing while half-immersed in warm water. Hopefully, revisiting a scene such as this will prompt your baby to resume nursing. Nap nurse.  This is usually the best way to woo a baby back to the breast, especially if she was previously accustomed to nursing while lying down in your bed. Pick a time of the day when you are most tired and your baby is most hungry. Minimize distractions.  At 10 months of age, babies can become easily distracted while nursing, especially if there is a lot of commotion in the room. Try what is dubbed ""closet nursing."" Pick a couple times of the day when she is most hungry. Go into a dark, quiet room, sit in a comfortable chair, sing her favorite lullaby, and let her nurse. Slow down on other feedings.  Continue to try to nurse her before you feed her other foods. Decrease the volume of solid foods and even supplemental bottles. You want to replant the idea in her mind (and her tummy) that food comes primarily from nursing, and secondarily from the plate and the bottles.  At 10 months of age it's unlikely that your baby is truly ready to wean, although it is possible. Try not to get so frustrated or impatient that your baby feels she is being forced to nurse. Go gradually with the above tips, and most likely, your nursing striker will return to extended breastfeeding within a week or two."
 Combining Breast and Bottle Feeding,http://www.parenting.com/article/combining-breast-and-bottle-feeding,"It was an easy two-hour drive to Scranton, PA, with her 10-week-old son, Connor, snoozing in his car seat, and the actress and writer Amy Wilson was ready for her performance in  The Vagina Monologues , the hilarious play about--well, you know what it's about. It would be her first time working since before Connor's arrival, but her parents lived in the area, so her mom was on call for babysitting. Despite some reflux, Connor had been a champion nurser. Wilson had yet to get him to drink any breast milk out of a bottle, however. ""I was sure that once he was hungry enough, he'd eat. Of course he would,"" says Wilson. He didn't. Eight hours later, Wilson returned to find her mother holding a wide-eyed Connor, who had refused to drink even an ounce of milk from the bottle--he'd gone purple with anger at the sight of it. ""I had listened to all the experts the first time around who warned of 'nipple confusion' if even one bottle was introduced too early,"" recalls Wilson. ""But I'd waited too long, and he never wanted any part of it. If I had to leave him for a funeral or a meeting or a haircut, he'd simply not eat until the moment I returned."" By now, you've surely heard that ""breast is best."" Breastfeeding is the ideal way to feed your child for the first year of life: It provides optimal nutrition and is a fantastic way to bond. It may reduce rates of childhood obesity, diabetes, and ear infections, among other health benefits. The only downside to nursing is that it may be hard: It can be physically exhausting and challenging to learn how to do it. ""The fact is, breastfeeding is easier for some women,"" says Marianne Neifert, M.D., author of  Great Expectations: The Essential Guide to Breastfeeding . ""Some women put in a lot of effort and they might not produce as much milk as someone who puts in less effort."" Add to this the fact that new moms don't get a ton of breastfeeding instruction during their short stay at the hospital, employers aren't always supportive of pumping, and much of America gets icked-out when a mom nurses at the mall. But before you throw in the towel, realize there's no one right way to feed a baby. You don't have to breastfeed exclusively--you can combine it with bottle-feeding in a routine that works for both of you. If doing a combo of the two means that you're happier and saner, then you should do it--without worrying about what anyone else thinks. ""Maybe more women would make it to a year of breastfeeding if they could go see a movie every once in a while,"" says Wilson, who recently wrote  When Did I Get Like This? The Screamer, The Worrier, The Dinosaur-Chicken-Nugget Buyer and Other Mothers I Swore I'd Never Be . Here's how to make the most of both feeding methods so you can get some rest, go to work, and maybe even get out to see that movie. Gear Up Your little sucker might have a preference when it comes to bottles, so you may need to try a few different types before you hit on the ones he likes best. Just be sure the ones you try are free of BPA, a potential toxin. If you're hoping to pump breast milk on a regular basis (you're going back to work, for example), you'll want a double electric breast pump. While they can be pricey (they average about $300), you'll soon save that much in formula expenses. If you're going to supplement with formula and won't be expressing much, a less-expensive manual pump will do the job. Not sure how you'll feel about pumping? Try it out by renting a hospital-grade electric pump for about $75 a month. Ask at your hospital or find locations near you at  Medelabreastfeedingus.com . Another great tool to have is a super-convenient hands-free bra/bustier, which means that you can e-mail, eat lunch, or entertain your toddler--all while pumping! (Sounds strange, but trust us--it makes a huge quality-of-life difference.) Or you can get the same effect by cutting two vertical openings in a sports bra to hold your pumping cups in place. Get Ready The idea of ""nipple confusion"" (the notion that once a baby is fed from a bottle, he'll never accept the breast again) has been largely debunked. The general guideline is that you want to wait until your milk supply is established, usually around two to three weeks after birth, and your baby is feeding well before introducing a bottle. But there aren't any hard-and-fast rules. Some moms successfully introduce a bottle almost as soon as they come home from the hospital. However, it's also possible to wait too long, says Susan Burger, a lactation consultant in New York City. Since babies start to get more socially aware around 6 weeks and become more specific about their preferences, some will balk at or even refuse the bottle if it's introduced much after this age. A good time to introduce those first few bottles is during the second feeding of the day, when your baby is hungry but not starving, and likely to be in a good mood. It can also help to have your partner or Grandma feed your baby the first bottle, so that your boobs aren't there to tempt him. Pump Like a Pro:  To maintain your milk supply at your current level, just turn to your pump whenever you would normally nurse your baby. If you want to stock up on extra milk, add in a pumping session. In fact, you may want to start doing this a few weeks before you return to work, so you have a nice starting supply. You'll have the most milk in the morning, so if you pump right after your morning feeding session, you can save that milk for later. Supplementing Secrets: If it's not realistic to pump at work or you can't do it as often as you need to, supplement with formula. Most babies will do fine on a regular cow's-milk formula, but ask your pediatrician what she recommends for your baby. Start by replacing just one feeding session with formula, and drop that nursing session. If you feel like your breasts are going to explode, you can pump a little bit to relieve the pressure and make it to your next feeding. (If you completely empty your breasts, that will just send a message to your boobs to produce more milk.) The ideal is to drop one nursing session a week; otherwise, you'll be at increased risk for clogged milk ducts and mastitis. Some women, however, find that they can get away with dropping a feeding every four or five days (you may want to write it all down to keep track, especially if you're still sleep-deprived!). When her second son, Seamus, was born 18 months after Connor, Wilson introduced the bottle early and often, and he switched easily between the two. ""So many women give up on breastfeeding after just a couple of weeks because it's hard and because it seems like it's all or nothing. No one tells you that it gets easier, that your partner can be on duty without your baby being warped, and that you just may come to love nursing,"" says Wilson. ""I think if there were less judgment, more support, and more open conversation about 'doing the combo' of nursing and bottle-feeding, many women would breastfeed longer. And that's a win-win for everyone."""
 5 Ways to Turn Routine Chores into Exercise,http://www.parenting.com/parenting-advice/mom/5-ways-to-turn-routine-chores-exercise,"Wake up and shower, get the kids dressed, make  breakfast , pack  lunches , find the missing homework, drive the kids to school, go grocery shopping...all before 9 a.m.! We know everything mothers can do. At times it seems they have "" super mommy strength ,"" but sometimes moms neglect to take time for themselvesto exercise their bodies and maintain their health. With such busy schedules, where is there time to fit in exercise routines? It's simple: At home. Movement can be fun, and you don't have to sacrifice your exercise to do household chores. Just combine housework and workouts in a daily movement routine. You can even  get your kids involved  to help them built active, healthy habits. Incorporating five simple movements while doing routine chores will help you to take the term ""super mom"" to a new level. 1. Grocery Squats Strengthen and tone your legs after a big grocery shopping trip. Keep your back straight and squat deeply by bending your knees to grab groceries from the bag and raise them to the counter. If you want an extra challenge, hold for 30 seconds and feel the burn. 2. Milk Gallon Bicep Curls Work toward tank-top arms while preparing breakfast for your family. Adding milk to your coffee or pouring a bowl of cereal? Grab the milk gallon from the fridge and perform 10 bicep curls per arm. (A full gallon of milk weighs 8 to 9 pounds.) 3. Clean Sweep Did you know you can burn 80 calories for every 20 minutes of sweeping?  Get the kids involved  by creating a game to see who can sweep the best and fastest. 4. Towel Twist Work your abs and get those towels folded. Sit next to a full basket of laundry and twist at the waist to grab an item from the basket. Twist to the other side to lay the folded item on a pile. Continue until your laundry is finished. 5. Lunge It Out Heading out to run some errands? Do walking lunges out the door. If you have a young child, hold her in your arms for a greater challenge. Alejandro Chabn   is a certified nutrition consultant and the CEO and creator of the   Yes You Can!

" Breast, Bottle, or Both?",http://www.parenting.com/article/breast-bottle-or-both-21333766,"Breast   Benefits:  You've heard it before -- breast is best. ""Breastfeeding protects your baby from illness and infection, enhances brain development, and lowers the risk of developing asthma and diabetes,"" says Marianne Neifert, M.D., a Denver pediatrician and the author of Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding. Moms benefit too: Nursing lowers your risk of breast cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and possibly osteoporosis. It also burns calories (about 500 a day), can be convenient (no bottles to wash or formula to mix), and is cheap (you only need a few nursing bras and, usually, a breast pump). If you pump breast milk, someone else can feed it to your baby by bottle.  Drawbacks:  It's all you, all the time: Nursing is time-consuming (a newborn can feed every two or three hours all day and night), and you need to pump even if Dad gives the baby a bottle of breast milk. ""Nursing can cause great fatigue,"" says Will Wilkoff, M.D., a pediatrician in Brunswick, Maine, and author of  The Maternity Leave Breastfeeding Plan . ""In fact, it's a bigger energy drain on your body than pregnancy."" Nursing can make some women self-conscious, and the learning curve can be steep. Sore nipples, plugged milk ducts, mastitis (a breast inflammation), and engorgement can be painful side effects. Scheduling can be a challenge, especially for working moms -- some jobs may not allow for multiple pumping breaks.  How I decided:  ""I breastfed my baby because it was the easiest method for me. When my son woke up at night, the milk was set to go -- it was already mixed and warmed.""  -- Misty Zerkel, Lyons, OR  ""I worried that breastfeeding would be embarrassing and that my husband might get grossed out. But even after soreness and mastitis, it still was the best choice -- and my husband is more amazed by my body than ever!""  -- Zoe Albright, Lee's Summit, MO Bottle  Benefits:  Feeding with a bottle can be very comforting: You see just how much is going into your baby and can be satisfied knowing the feedings have been complete. Bottle-feeding can provide an emotional closeness and nurturing similar to breastfeeding. ""There's a quicker start to bottle-feeding -- you just pop it in the baby's mouth and you're off,"" says Dr. Wilkoff. You can also share the feedings with Dad or a sitter while you're freed up to work, care for other kids, or rest.  Drawbacks:  ""In a word -- constipation. You just don't see this in breastfed babies, but it's pretty common in formula-fed ones,"" says Dr. Wilkoff. Babies can also develop an intolerance to formula, so several switches may have to be made to find the most suitable version for them to drink. Overfeeding is a possibility, especially if moms encourage their tot to finish the prepared bottle even when the baby is satisfied. Formula is costly, though it varies by brand and preparation (ready-to-go liquid or powdered, individual servings or bulk packages). Bottles and nipples need to be purchased, initially sterilized, and washed after that. Feedings have to be prepared, stored, and then packed for most outings with your baby.  How I decided:  ""Bottle-feeding allowed my three step-kids to help feed their new baby sister, which they were so excited to do.""  -- Kimberly Carney, Drexel Hill, PA  ""I was getting terrible migraine headaches, so in order to take prescription medications, I put my daughter on formula. I think that the bottle-feeding has helped her and my husband develop a strong bond.""  -- Kara Tobaben, Fairfax, VA   Both   Benefits:  Supplementing breastfeeding with bottles can be the best of both worlds: You're giving your baby the nutritional benefits of breast milk while giving yourself some flexibility and a chance to rest. Adding formula bottles to a nursing routine can be ideal for working moms -- no pump or on-the-job breaks needed. It's also a relief for those with low milk supply or latch-on difficulties, or who are exhausted or frustrated by nursing. Giving your baby expressed breast milk is even better. If pumping works well for you, your supply can usually be maintained while you're at work and nursing can continue when you're at home.  Drawbacks:  Fully breastfed babies are the most protected from illness. ""The immune benefits from breast milk work best if it's the only food being given,"" says Dr. Neifert. And while most babies can easily switch between breast and bottle, some may refuse. Or your baby may prefer the faster flow of a bottle and nurse less frequently, which means your milk production will decrease. ""Cutting back on nursing is not always a linear process, so that breastfeeding only half the time may produce less than half the milk,"" explains Dr. Wilkoff. If you decide to do the combo with formula, wait until after the first few weeks so you can build up your milk supply. To avoid clogged ducts as you add bottles, wait four to seven days before dropping a nursing session.  How I decided:  ""I like to breastfeed at home, but when I go out I either pump milk for her or have a bottle of formula ready. It's been very convenient.""  -- Eliana Munoz, Astoria, NY  ""My son was in the NICU for a week, so I wasn't able to be there all the time or pump enough milk. At home I nursed most of the time, but since my production was still low, I supplemented with bottles of formula.""  -- Jamie Wanis, Gaithersburg, MD  The Breastfeeding Mom's Bill of Rights  As if engorged breasts weren't enough of a pain, breastfeeders have to face bossy strangers and cruel coworkers. Here, a review of your rights.  1. If you have a right to be somewhere with your baby, you have a right to breastfeed there.  It's the law, says La Leche League International. While there are a few places, such as courtrooms, where babies aren't permitted, women can legally breastfeed in most public places -- stores, restaurants, parks, and malls. This holds true even if your state doesn't have legislation protecting a woman's right to breastfeed in public. (Almost half of all states do; visit LaLeche League to see if yours does.)  2. You have a right to ask for pumping accommodations at work.  American employers aren't required to provide moms with a place to pump, but several states mandate that employers enable women to breastfeed. And most require that workers be given break time and a space to pump that isn't a bathroom stall. The Breastfeeding Promotion Act includes a provision to offer tax incentives for businesses that provide private lactation areas. The key to successful pumping at work is clear communication with supervisors, say experts. Ask for a room with a lockable door, a place to sit, and an electrical outlet for the pump.  3. You have a right to breastfeed for as long as you see fit.  While nursing into toddlerhood is common elsewhere, Americans often view it as odd or even perverse. Critics may be surprised to learn that the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends nursing ""for as long as mutually desired."" That can mean up to age 3 or 4, says Lawrence Gartner, M.D., executive committee chair of the AAP's Section on Breastfeeding. In addition to health benefits, he says, nursing provides a strong bond between mother and child.  -- Katherine Kam  The Bottle-feeding Mom's Bill of Rights   Only a mom can know what's best for her baby -- and for herself. So, instead of letting someone else guilt-trip you, know your rights.   1. You have a right to bottle-feed without guilt or lengthy excuses.  Sure, some moms aren't able to breastfeed for health reasons. ""There are women determined to breastfeed who just aren't able to produce enough milk,"" explains Phillip Stubblefield, M.D., a professor of ob-gyn at the Boston University School of Medicine. But whether it's health-related, because of painful side effects, or for another reason entirely, don't feel that you have to explain yourself to avoid being publicly ostracized. ""Women have the right to decide what's best for themselves and for their baby,"" says Diane Sanford, Ph.D., who specializes in women's health. If you feel good about yourself and your choices, those positive feelings will get passed on to your infant.  2. You have a right to supplement nursing with formula or breast milk.  Don't feel like you have to choose one method or the other. Many women prefer a combination of breast and bottle. (Be aware that if you choose to supplement with formula, you'll have a decreased milk supply if you don't pump regularly.)  3. You have a right to bottle-feed without trying to breastfeed first.  ""Trust your instincts,"" says Sanford. ""There's not a lot of encouraging literature out there about bottle-feeding. The worst situation is if a mom wants to bottle-feed but is persuaded by others to breastfeed."" While breastfeeding may be ideal, there's nothing wrong with using formula, says Mel Heyman, M.D., a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics committee on nutrition and a professor of pediatrics at the University of California, San Francisco. What's most important to your baby's development is love, affection, and a close emotional bond. Says Sanford: ""Whether it's breast or bottle, you can still provide these things to a baby.""  -- Emily Hebert"
 Best Foods to Eat While Pregnant,http://www.parenting.com/best-foods-to-eat-while-pregnant,"Protein Why:  The amino acids found in protein are the building blocks of your baby's body. Where:  Get the daily recommended amount of 60 grams from any three of the following servings: 1 egg, 2 to 3 ounces cooked meat, 8 ounces skim milk, 1 cup yogurt, 1 ounce hard cheese, 2 tablespoons peanut butter, or 1/2 cup cooked dried beans. Carbohydrates Why:  Complex carbohydrates, such as those found in whole grains and certain vegetables, provide long-lasting energy and fiber, which helps prevent constipation. Avoid simple carbohydrates -- found in white sugar, white flour, and the foods that contain them (cakes, white bread) -- because they are nutritionally empty and fattening. Where:  You'll need a whopping nine servings a day, which might come from: 1 slice whole wheat bread, 1 tortilla, 1/2 bagel, 1 ounce cold cereal, 1/2 cup cooked pasta or rice, 1 medium potato, 1/2 cup corn. Fats Why:  Fats are an important source of energy, and they help you metabolize vitamins A, D, E, and K. Still, fats supply a lot of calories, so limit them to no more than one-third of your daily count. Where: Have four of the following servings daily: 2 ounces cheese, 2 tablespoons peanut butter, 3/4 cup tuna salad, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon mayonnaise, 3 or 4 ounces lean meat, 1 egg or egg yolk, 1/2 small avocado, 1 tablespoon butter. When cooking, stick to the more healthful unsaturated fats, including olive, canola, and peanut oils. Avoid less desirable saturated fats, found in meat and dairy products, as well as palm and coconut oils. Calcium Why:  Calcium is critical in building your baby's bones and teeth. If you don't consume enough during pregnancy, the fetus will rob your calcium stores, putting you at risk for bone loss. Where:  To get the necessary 1,200 milligrams, consume at least four of the following servings: 8 ounces skim milk, 1 cup raw dark green leafy vegetables (salad greens, broccoli, spinach, kale), 3 to 4 ounces canned salmon or sardines, 3/4 cup cottage cheese, 1 cup yogurt, or 1 ounce hard cheese. Iron Why:  Iron is required to make hemoglobin, the red-blood-cell component that carries oxygen through the bloodstream. During pregnancy, more hemoglobin is required to supply your baby with oxygen. And the fetus also uses iron to build its own blood supply. Where:  Pregnant women need twice as much iron -- about 30 milligrams a day -- so your doctor may prescribe a prenatal vitamin that contains iron. You should also try to eat some of the following foods daily: dried fruits, lean red meat, dried beans and pasta, whole-grain breads, and dark green leafy vegetables. Vitamin C Why:  This nutrient is essential because it helps in the manufacture of collagen, a protein that provides structure to your baby's bones, cartilage, muscles, and blood vessels. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant, which means that it helps prevent disease. Where:  Your body can't store vitamin C, so it's crucial that you consume the necessary 65 milligrams daily. Get it by eating two to three of the following servings: 1/2 cup citrus-fruit juice, 1/2 grapefruit, 1 medium orange, 1/2 cup cantaloupe, 1/2 cup shredded cabbage or coleslaw, 2/3 cup cooked broccoli, 3/4 cup cooked cauliflower, 1 1/2 large tomatoes. Folic Acid Why:  This B vitamin is used to produce the extra blood you and your baby need and helps some enzymes function. Taken before conception and early in pregnancy, folic acid also helps prevent neural-tube defects (which occur when the brain, spinal cord, or their coverings do not form normally) and cleft lip or palate (a gap in the lip or roof of the mouth). Where:  Good sources of folic acid include leafy green vegetables, broccoli, asparagus, lean beef, oranges, lentils, and peanuts. The FDA now requires that pastas, breads, and grains be enriched with folic acid, so be sure to eat plenty of these complex carbs. Your doctor may also prescribe a supplement -- 0.4 milligram a day for most women, 4.0 milligrams if you are at risk of having a baby with a neural-tube defect. Vitamin A Why:  This nutrient is vital to healthy skin, bones, and eyes and helps to create the cells that will make up your baby's internal organs. Where:  You'll get all you need each day (800 micrograms) with just four servings of the following: 3/4 cup vegetable juice, 3/4 cup dark yellow vegetables, 8 ounces milk, 1/2 cup cantaloupe, 1 large peach or nectarine, 1 cup dark leafy vegetables.  Caution: Excessive levels of vitamin A (over 10,000 IU) can be harmful to you and your baby, so don't overdo it with supplements. Carbohydrates Why:  Vitamin D helps build bone, tissue, and teeth. It also enables your body to use calcium and phosphorus. Where:  Your four 8-ounce servings of skim milk are about the best source of the 10 micrograms you need daily. Egg yolks, sardines, and canned salmon also provide vitamin D. Or get a little sunshine, which helps your skin manufacture it. Zinc Why:  This new addition to the must-have pregnancy diet has recently proved to aid fetal growth. Where:  You can get the necessary 20 milligrams a day in your recommended amount of whole grains, meat, and milk, as well as oysters, shellfish, and other seafood. Fluids Why:  Water is essential for developing new cells, maintaining blood volume, and processing other nutrients. It also minimizes swelling, constipation, and your risk of urinary tract infections. Where:  Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day, including milk, fruit juices, and decaffeinated tea or coffee."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Nursing Caries,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-nursing-carries,"Q: My son was diagnosed at thirteen months with nursing caries. I have cut down his nighttime feedings to one or two. I have also been wiping and brushing his teeth, day and night. My question is, what else should I do? My son is not ready to be weaned and neither am I, but I want to protect his teeth. A: It's good that your child's dentist detected this problem early, and you are wise to seek remedies to prevent further tooth decay. Erosion of the teeth enamel is much more common with nighttime bottlefeeding, but it does also occasionally occur in breastfed babies. When babies fall asleep, saliva secretion decreases, so they lose the natural rinsing action of saliva that they have during daytime feeding. The sugars in the milk bathe the teeth during the night and eventually can cause tooth decay. Nursing caries are more prevalent in babies who enjoy frequent nighttime feedings. I dub them, ""all night suckers."" Try these tips to continue letting your baby enjoy the health and developmental benefits of breastfeeding, yet protect his precious teeth from decay. Lessen night feedings.  It's common for toddlers to increase their number of night nursings. They get so busy during the day and forget to nurse, so they make up for it at night. Purposely increase the number of daytime feedings by nap nursing -- choose a couple times during the day when you are the most tired, and lie down and nurse your baby. Toddlers also get distracted easily during daytime nursing. So, take your baby in a dark, quiet room and get down to the business of nursing. Ease him into a feeding pattern that helps him learn that daytime is for feeding and nighttime is for sleeping. Tank up baby with a before-bed feeding.  Make the last feeding of the day a big one. Give your baby a feeding of solid food later in the evening. Mashed avocado is a filling food for babies because it is high in healthy fats and fiber. Besides nursing your baby to sleep, consider awakening your baby just before you go to bed for another tank-up feeding. Brush his teeth frequently.  The two most important times to cleanse those pearly whites is right after the first feeding in the morning and after the last feeding at night. Try a soft-bristle brush or wrap gauze around your index finger and use it as a toothbrush. Nursing carries are most prominent in the front teeth, especially along the gum lines. Be sure to curve your finger, or the brush, enough to cleanse behind the teeth. It often takes two people to brush a baby's teeth, so you and Dad sit facing one another knees to knees and stretch baby across your laps, with his head on your lap. Then you can brush his teeth from above, which helps you get better access to the teeth. Dad can hold the squirming baby while you brush the teeth. You can also give your toddler his own toothbrush and capitalize on his natural desire to mimic. While you are brushing your teeth, encourage him to do likewise. Consider a fluoride supplement.  Since babies usually don't drink enough water, especially if you drink unfluoridated bottled water, ask your dentist for the appropriate dosage of a fluoride supplement for your baby. This could be in the form of daily fluoride drops or you could use no more than a pea-sized dab of fluoridated toothpaste. Concerning fluoride, be sure not to give more than your dentist prescribes, since too much fluoride can weaken the enamel instead of strengthen it. Avoid sticky stuff.  Because of the choking hazard, baby is too young to suck on hard candy anyway, but with toddlers, avoid caramel and sweets that stick to the teeth. Substitute night ""nursings.""  The term ""nursing"" does not mean only breastfeeding; it implies any method of comforting. A father can ""nurse,"" too. If your baby needs a middle-of-the-night sucking to soothe him back to sleep, let him suck on your finger or knuckle. Sometimes a lullaby will do just that -- lull a baby back to sleep. For babies who want a nighttime bottle, try the trick I call ""watering down"" -- each night gradually dilute the formula with increasing amounts of water until your baby's bottle is 100 percent water."
 Best Foods to Eat While Pregnant,http://www.parenting.com/article/best-foods-eat-while-pregnant,"Protein Why: The  amino acids  found in protein are the building blocks of your baby's body. Where: Get the daily recommended amount of 60 grams from any three of the following servings: 1 egg, 2 to 3 ounces cooked meat, 8 ounces skim milk, 1 cup yogurt, 1 ounce hard cheese, 2 tablespoons peanut butteror 1/2 cup cooked dried beans. Carbohydrates Why: Complex carbohydrates, such as those found in whole grains and certain vegetables, provide long-lasting energy and fiber, which helps prevent constipation. Avoid simple carbohydratesfound in white sugar, white flourand the foods that contain them (cakes, white bread)because they are nutritionally empty and fattening. Where: You'll need a whopping nine servings a day, which might come from: 1 slice whole wheat bread, 1 tortilla, 1/2 bagel, 1 ounce cold cereal, 1/2 cup cooked pasta or rice, 1 medium potato, 1/2 cup corn. Fats Why: Fats are an important source of energy, and they help you metabolize vitamins A, D, E, and K. Still, fats supply a lot of calories, so limit them to no more than one-third of your daily count. Where: Have four of the following servings daily: 2 ounces cheese, 2 tablespoons peanut butter, 3/4 cup tuna salad, 2 tablespoons Parmesan cheese, 1 tablespoon mayonnaise, 3 or 4 ounces lean meat, 1 egg or egg yolk, 1/2 small avocado, 1 tablespoon butter. When cooking, stick to the more healthful unsaturated fats, including olive, canolaand peanut oils. Avoid less desirable saturated fats, found in meat and dairy products, as well as palm and coconut oils. Calcium Why:  Calcium  is critical in building your baby's bones and teeth. If you don't consume enough during pregnancy, the fetus will rob your calcium stores, putting you at risk for bone loss. Where: To get the necessary 1,200 milligrams, consume at least four of the following servings: 8 ounces skim milk, 1 cup raw dark green leafy vegetables (salad greens, broccoli, spinach, kale), 3 to 4 ounces canned salmon or sardines, 3/4 cup cottage cheese, 1 cup yogurtor 1 ounce hard cheese. Iron Why:  Iron  is required to make hemoglobin, the red-blood-cell component that carries oxygen through the bloodstream. During pregnancy, more hemoglobin is required to supply your baby with oxygen. And the fetus also uses iron to build its own blood supply. Where: Pregnant women need twice as much ironabout 30 milligrams a dayso your doctor may prescribe a prenatal vitamin that contains iron. You should also try to eat some of the following foods daily: dried fruits, lean red meat, dried beans and pasta, whole-grain breadsand dark green leafy vegetables. Vitamin C Why: This nutrient is essential because it helps in the manufacture of collagen, a protein that provides structure to your baby's bones, cartilage, musclesand blood vessels. Vitamin C is also an antioxidant, which means that it helps prevent disease. Where: Your body can't store vitamin C, so it's crucial that you consume the necessary 65 milligrams daily. Get it by eating two to three of the following servings: 1/2 cup citrus-fruit juice, 1/2 grapefruit, 1 medium orange, 1/2 cup cantaloupe, 1/2 cup shredded cabbage or coleslaw, 2/3 cup cooked broccoli, 3/4 cup cooked cauliflower, 1 1/2 large tomatoes. Folic Acid Why: This B vitamin is used to produce the extra blood you and your baby need and helps some enzymes function. Taken before conception and early in pregnancy, folic acid also helps prevent neural-tube defects (which occur when the brain, spinal cord, or their coverings do not form normally) and cleft lip or palate (a gap in the lip or roof of the mouth). Where: Good sources of folic acid include leafy green vegetables, broccoli, asparagus, lean beef, oranges, lentilsand peanuts. The FDA now requires that pastas, breadsand grains be enriched with folic acid, so be sure to eat plenty of these complex carbs. Your doctor may also prescribe a supplement0.4 milligram a day for most women, 4.0 milligrams if you are at risk of having a baby with a neural-tube defect. Vitamin A Why: This nutrient is vital to healthy skin, bones, and eyes and helps to create the cells that will make up your baby's internal organs. Where: You'll get all you need each day (800 micrograms) with just four servings of the following: 3/4 cup vegetable juice, 3/4 cup dark yellow vegetables, 8 ounces milk, 1/2 cup cantaloupe, 1 large peach or nectarine, 1 cup dark leafy vegetables.  Caution: Excessive levels of vitamin A (over 10,000 IU) can be harmful to you and your baby, so don't overdo it with supplements. Carbohydrates Why: Vitamin D helps build bone, tissue, and teeth. It also enables your body to use calcium and phosphorus. Where: Your four 8-ounce servings of skim milk are about the best source of the 10 micrograms you need daily. Egg yolks, sardinesand canned salmon also provide vitamin D. Or get a little sunshine, which helps your skin manufacture it. Zinc Why: This new addition to the must-have pregnancy diet has recently proved to aid fetal growth. Where: You can get the necessary 20 milligrams a day in your recommended amount of whole grains, meat, and milk, as well as oysters, shellfishand other seafood. Fluids Why: Water is essential for developing new cells, maintaining blood volumeand processing other nutrients. It also minimizes swelling, constipationand your risk of urinary tract infections. Where: Drink at least eight 8-ounce glasses of fluid a day, including milk, fruit juicesand decaffeinated tea or coffee."
 Is Fish Okay for Babies?,http://www.parenting.com/article/should-babies-eat-fish,"As a pediatrician and father of eight, I've realized how much children's health and behavior is affected, for better or worse, by what they eat. Of course, you already know how important a balanced diet full of whole grains, vegetables, fruitand lean proteins is, but when it comes to babies and toddlers, one thing I always found missing from their diet was fish. Parents didn't seem to think it was a ""baby"" food. But over the years, I'd been reading more and more about the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, essential nutrients found in seafood. Study after study was proving their contribution to infant brain development and more. I began ""prescribing"" omega-3's to my patients in 2000 by encouraging their parents to offer them more fish. Since then, I've only grown more convinced that omega-3's are the head-to-toe nutrient because they're good for nearly every organ of a child's body, from the brain to the skin. Most parents, however, are unsure about feeding their babies fish, which is the richest source of DHA, the healthiest type of omega-3 fatty acid for infants. Here's whyand howto ""go fish,"" for both your baby and you! Fish facts What eating fish can do for you and your baby: Make your baby smarter. In the '80s and early '90s, initial research suggested that infants who received DHA-enriched formula experienced improved cognitive development, leading the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in 2001, to allow infant formula to be supplemented with the brain-building omega-3, DHA. Since then, the proof keeps piling up. A 2003 study in the journal Pediatrics found that mothers who took omega-3 supplements during pregnancy and lactation increased their children's cognitive abilities at 4 years of age. In 2005, another study revealed that schoolchildren who were given omega-3 supplements showed improved reading and spelling scores. Since a child's brain grows fastest prenatally and continues to grow rapidly in the first year of life, tripling in size by the end of the first year, this is an ideal time to get DHA into his diet. Increase focus. Another study found that toddlers whose mothers had higher DHA blood levels at delivery were better able to maintain focus on an object compared with tots whose mothers had lower DHA levels. Improve vision. DHA has been shown to help sharpen vision in infants. Boost mood. Research has shown that adults who consume more omega-3's have a lower rate of mood disorders and that women who eat fish high in these fatty acids during pregnancy suffer less postpartum depression. Why? Omega-3's may act in the brain to raise levels of ""happy"" hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, the neurotransmitters in the brain that are also targeted by some prescription antidepressants. I'll eat to that! Enhance immunity. These fantastic fatty acids have also been linked to improved immunity. In one study, Danish toddlers who consumed formula supplemented with fish oil had much higher levels of a protein that's key to healthy immune function than those who drank plain formula or cow's milk. Prevent eczema. Omega-3's can decrease inflammation in all parts of the body, including the skin. Serving a little salmon or chunk-light tuna to your baby before 9 months may actually help to protect him from developing the allergic skin condition, according to a Swedish study. Fish talk Answers to the most common questions parents ask me: When can I start feeding my baby fish? Except for shellfish, you can serve your baby pured or mashed fish as early as 6 months when he starts eating solids. Fish may seem like a ""grown-up"" food, but it is the ideal fare for infants. Read on for serving ideas. What types of fish are best? Oily fish such as chunk-light tuna, sardines, halibutand salmon are the best sources of healthy omega-3's. But sardines aren't practical for feeding to a baby, and halibut and tuna are higher in mercury. That makes salmon the best source of DHA (again, the star omega-3 fatty acid) and, in my opinion, the healthiest fish for kids and adults alike. But almost all seafood contains omega-3's, so try giving your baby a variety of low-mercury fish. Pollock is used in most commercial fish sticks and is another good choice. What seafood should we avoid? Some fish are high in mercury and other pollutants. Check out the ""Mercury Meter,"" a guide to mercury levels in commonly consumed fish, from the Natural Resources Defense Council. Try to stick to the fish in the ""low mercury"" category, though infants can eat up to three ounces per week of the fish listed as ""moderate mercury"" (adults can eat up to six ounces). Avoid those fish in the ""high"" category altogether. Finally, shellfish can be allergenic; your doctor may recommend holding off until age 2. Are omega-3's the only nutritional benefit of fish? Omega-3's are the standout nutrient, but fish is also a wonderful source of lean protein. It's high in vitamin D, too, an important vitamin for strong bones that many children are lacking, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. How much DHA does my baby need? I recommend that infants get around 300 milligrams of DHA per day, more than half of which they can get from their regular daily feedings of breast milk or formula fortified with DHA. On top of that, try to give your solids-eating tot a total of about two ounces of wild salmon per week. Once your baby is off formula and/or breast milk, try to up her amount of wild salmon to six or seven ounces per week. If you find it difficult to reach that amount, consider a supplement to make up the difference. Ask your doctor for a recommendation, or try my own DHA liquid called Go Fish (find retailers at  Drsearshealthykids . com ). I'm pregnant/breastfeeding. Should I eat more fish? You want to be careful that you're not consuming too much mercury but also getting a healthy amount of DHA. Stick to the recommendations already given in terms of how much fish you eat and, in addition, make sure your prenatal vitamin contains DHA (most do). Try to get at least 300 milligrams per day. For reference, the amount of DHA and other omega-3's in six ounces of wild Alaskan salmon is around 2,000 milligrams. Fish food Doubtful your baby will eat fish? Start with salmon, and try these tips: Don't stress it. Pop open a can of boneless wild salmon, and dole out bites to your baby (no need to cook it!). Blend the salmon flakes into mac 'n' cheese or mashed potatoes. Another option: HappyBaby sells a frozen puree of wild salmon, lentilsand sweet potatoes (find retailers at  Happybabyfood.com ). Spread it out. Puree cooked salmon (canned or fresh) with lemon, olive oiland seasoningsthen spread it on bread or crackers. Strip it down. My daughter, Hayden, makes delicious breaded salmon strips that her son loves. Just as you would with chicken fingers, dip inch-wide strips of salmon fillet into beaten eggs and coat them with a mixture of whole-wheat flour, whole-wheat bread crumbs, parmesan cheeseand a dash of salt. Then bake the strips for about eight minutes. However you prepare it, offer fish to your baby from the start, and it will be a favorite food. Learn more about DHAfor kids"
 Deciphering Cloth Diapers: Help!,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/project-pregnancy/lexi-walters-wright/deciphering-cloth-diapers-help,"25w3d -  It seems fitting that the number of hours spent trying to choose  how  to cover our child's bum may be directly proportional to the amount of time we will spend actually engaged in the changing of those diapers. Because of all the fact-finding missions I've embarked on during this pregnancy, none have kept me up clicking into the depths of teeny commerce sites and emphatic blogs and endless online forums like learning about cloth diapering has. And still, I need help. Yours, please, if you have any experience with cloth and kids and can help a couple who're mystified by the actual mechanics of making this route work. To preface: We don't have access to a diaper service; we do have a washer/ dryer/ space for a clothesline; our home potties can't handle flushable diaper inserts; we do plan on leaving home with this kid regularly. We don't poo-poo disposables, but we are eager to give cloth a fair shake. And now, I beg of you: 1) Did you initially invest in one system (all prefolds with covers, for example, or all AIOs) and stick with it? Some moms I've spoken with say that it's laughable to think you can guess which styles will fityour yet-to-be-baby's legs and bum. Others have said that since their friends and family were in gift-buying mode, they registered for the brands and styles they liked most and hoped for the best  sometimes that worked out, and sometimes they were on  DiaperSwappers  in the middle of Month Two, trading out leaky models for ones that fit. How much did you plan, and how diverse was your stash? 2) Be honest: Do  any  cloth types work well for scrawny newborns? Word is that between the gluey meconium poo and those itsy initial thighs (and, OK, new-parent delirium), sticking with newborn disposables for the first weeks can make potentially dark days seem a little brighter. But I've also heard happy rumblings about the  Tiny gPants  by gDiapers, and moms who've just gone with cover-less prefolds in the early days  what worked for you? 3) How well do hybrid diaper systems work out, really? And do you supplement with others? I love the concept that one system  Flip  or  gDiapers  or  GroVia  can be all-cloth (with either cotton on micro fiber liners) or semi-disposable (using biodegradable liners). In theory, that means that the sort of insert we would use could be tailored to the day's activities or, let's be honest, our enthusiasm for  yet another load  of laundry this week. But I've heard mixed feelings about how well hybrids work overnight (both in their wash 'em  and  toss 'em modes), leading some parents to opt for either AIOs like ( FuzziBunz  or  bumGenius ) or fully-disposables for sleeping. How have you found hybrids? BONUS QUESTION:  If you're composting your bio liners, can you please tell me what set-up seems to work for your family? One can + wet bag for covers, a separate can for compost? Do you line the compost one with biodegradable bags? 4) Describe your wash bag/pail(s). Do the pricey step-to-open cans really contain the stinky better than open-topped garbage pails or hanging wet bags do? Do you use one container for covers and one for inserts? I'm especially interested in how big your diaper bin(s) are  3 gallon? 10? (Please,  please , tell me no bigger.) Wise, kind parents: my progeny, the Mister, and I thank you in advance."
" Back In My Day, We Didn't Go to Preschool",http://www.parenting.com/blogs/mom-congress/melissa-taylor/back-my-day-we-didnt-go-preschool,"When my 20-year old was little, hardly anyone went to preschool. Now if you dont send  your kids  preschool youre looked down on. Why is that? asks my  girlfriend, Rajean . Were sitting with our feet soaking in hot basins of water at the nail salon.  Hmmm, I know what Rajean is talking about.  WHY PRESCHOOL  I phone  Barbara Willer, Ph.D. Deputy Executive Director of the National Association for the Education of Young Children ( NAEYC)  to ask.  20 years ago, the value of preschool was understood for social aspects and cognitive aspects ."" But, the achievement gap begins early on "" she explains. Which is why it's very important for all children to have  access  to preschool, especially for children of disadvantage. (Access meaning both affordable and high quality.)  Two big benefits of preschool are: 1. New experiences. 2. Improved vocabulary.  Often these benfits are already present in highly-educated families, making preschool less of a necessity than in families with less education.  But, decades of research show that a  high quality early experiences make a difference in childrens lifelong academic and social success.  ( NAEYC position statement.)  For all kids.  From all backgrounds.  COST Have you priced preschools lately? They're expensive. My own kids attended several different programs because of moving, cost, and my growing awareness of what made for a good program.  The NAEYC  website says, "" Unlike K-12 education -- a publicly financed system with a relatively stable funding base -- most early childhood care and education services operate in a very price-sensitive market financed primarily by fees from families and supplemented by public and private contributions. Many families cannot pay the full cost of quality care, and the ongoing commitment from public and private contributions is seldom guaranteed.""  Rajean admits, "" I have felt a bit judged for not sending my son, who will be five at the end of this month, to preschool. "" Our toenails turn bright orange as she explains, "" I've been both a stay-at-home and work-at-home mom with him and simply haven't been able to justify the expense of sending him to someone else to teach him kindergarten readiness. ""  HIGH QUALITY So let's say you find an affordable program, how do you know if it's any good? My second daughter spent months in mediocre program just because everyone else in our new neighborhood sent their kids there. (I know, I know. Not a good reason for attending. No, if everyone jumped off a cliff . . .)  "" We do have an accreditation process ,"" laughs Willer when I reluctantly admit my lame method of finding good program. "" Thats the purpose of it, to measure quality, to provide parents with a short cut, a way of knowing that programs have met a set of professional standards that are based on developmentally appropriate .""  Hallelujah!Search for an  accredited program ;you'll be glad you did. (Don't I wish I had.)  "" The value of education begins early ,"" reminds Waller, "" preschool offers an opportunity for a positive educational experience .""  What do you think? Will you send your children to an ECE program? How will you decide?"
 Will You Still Be Fertile in 5 Years?,http://www.parenting.com/article/will-you-still-be-fertile-in-5-years21336226,"Thinking of having another child? You may have less time than you imagine to conceive without difficulty. Still, you may be able to take steps now to improve your chances. To help judge the  state of your fertility , consider these questions: 1. How old are you? Age is by far the biggest factor in fertility, and even the most advanced infertility treatments aren't always able to turn back the clock. ""Women are postponing childbearing until later in lifethat's the very reason we see more problems today,"" says Pamela Madsen, executive director of the American Infertility Association. Some researchers believe that fertility peaks as early as a woman's late 20s, and there's a consensus that by her early 30s, both the quantity and the quality of her eggs have begun to decline. It's a gradual process, so there's certainly no need to panic. But if you're 30, you may not want to wait ten years to start trying to get pregnant again. At age 35 about three-quarters of women will be able to conceive without treatment, but by age 40 only half will, says Owen Davis, M.D., director of the IVF Program at Cornell Medical Center in New York City. By age 45 it's under 10 percent. The risk of miscarriage also goes up with age. At 35, about one in five pregnancies doesn't result in a live birth; by age 42 more than half fail, according to a study of over 500,000 women million women in Denmark. An older egg becomes an embryo that's more prone to genetic damage, researchers believe. Infertility is traditionally defined as the inability to conceive after one year of unprotected sex. ""In my opinion, a woman under thirty-five should try to conceive for that amount of time before she seeks medical help to find out why she's not getting pregnant,"" says Magdy Milad, M.D., a reproductive endocrinologist and an associate professor of obstetrics/gynecology at Northwestern University Medical School, in Chicago. ""Between the ages of 35 and 39, she should try for six months. And after the age of 40, she should try for three months and then see a doctor for an evaluation, just to make sure that nothing's wrong and she doesn't run out of time to try treatment."" 2. Do you smoke? If so, you're hurting your chances of getting pregnant at any age. Exposing your eggs to nicotine will not only affect the quality of your eggs but decrease your ovaries' supply. The more cigarettes a woman smokes daily, the lower her chances of conceiving. Smoking can also speed up the age at which menopause begins, prematurely closing your lifetime window of fertility. The good news is that quitting now can restore much of your fertility. It's not immediate, though. ""Once a woman quits, it can take several months for smoking-related toxins to be cleared from the body,"" says Dr. Milad. Passive smoking interferes too: In one study, women exposed to smoke at work or at home were less likely to conceive within a year than peers who were exposed to little or none. 3. Are you at a healthy weight? Being seriously over- or underweight - for a woman who's 5 foot 4, for instance, being heavier than 175 pounds (a body mass index of 30) or lighter than 105 pounds (a body mass index of 18)  may have a bearing on fertility, but only if it affects ovulation. If your periods are normal, your weight is unlikely to impact your ability to get pregnant, says Bryan Cowan, M.D., chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at the  University of Mississippi Medical Center , in Jackson. But if you're overweight and your periods are irregular, talk to your doctor. On the other hand, if you're very thin or have recently lost a lot of weight and your periods have become irregular or have stopped, gaining weight may be the first step toward fertility. 4. What medications or remedies are you taking? Thousands of prescription and over-the-counter medications  as well as herbal remedies  can have an effect on fertility. But the main concern is a class of drugs that affect your body's production of luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH)  key players in your ovulatory cycle. These include steroids (for asthma and rheumatoid arthritis), as well as prescription medicines that contain metoclopramide (for gastrointestinal upset) or phenothiazines (for anxiety.) It's always a good idea to talk with your doctor about which medications you are taking  or have taken  that might have an impact on fertility. Contraceptives may also have an effect. If you've been on the Pill for a long time, it may take two to five months for your body to start ovulating normally once you go off it; that's also true for the newer hormone-based contraceptives like the Mirena IUD or the Nuva ring. ""It's a myth that taking the Pill will prevent you from getting pregnant in the future,"" says Helane Rosenberg, Ph.D., egg donor coordinator at  IVF New Jersey , in Somerset ""But if you've been taking it for a long time, it could be masking a problem that would make you ovulate irregularly if you weren't taking the contraceptive."" The exception is if you've been treated with Depo Provera - in that case, the wait could be much longer. ""Since the drug is injected into muscle, the hormone absorption may be so slow that it could take as long as a year for your fertility to return to normal,"" says William Gibbons, M.D., chairman of the department of obstetrics/gynecology at  Eastern Virginia Medical School , in Norfolk. Norplant, though, has no adverse effect on fertility once it's removed. If you're using herbal remedies, be wary: They're not regulated, so there's no requirement that their effects on conception and pregnancy be properly researched. Some reports have suggested that popular supplements  Saint-John's-wort, ginkgo, Echinacea  may negatively affect fertility, but other studies have found no effect, so there's no way to tell yet. ""If you're having trouble conceiving and you're taking herbal supplements, you might want to stop, just in case,"" says registered dietitian Paul Thomas, editor of  The Dietary Supplement,  a newsletter for health professionals and consumers.  More important questions 5. Have you ever had a sexually transmitted disease (STD)? If it was caught early and treated, an STD will probably not affect your ability to get pregnant. But one that was untreated for a long period of time may cause problems; untreated chlamydia, for instance, can lead to pelvic inflammatory disease, which may make you infertile. Chlamydia and gonorrhea can also cause scarring of the fallopian tubes or low-grade infections that can change how receptive your uterine lining is, says Carolyn Salafia, M.D., director of EarlyPath Diagnostics, a research facility in Larchmont, NY. That's why it's important to be checked for STDs by your doctor before you try to get pregnant. Your partner should get checked too: STDS can also block production of sperm. 6. Was your last delivery difficult? Even if you've had a c-section, you won't necessarily find it harder to conceive your next child, unless there was tissue scarring, which can potentially impair fertility. (Nor do the vast majority of abortions affect conception.) On the other hand, even a problem-free pregnancy doesn't mean it'll be easy to get pregnant the next time. ""If your first pregnancy was uneventful, it excludes certain problems in the future, such as specific congenital abnormalities, but it's not a guarantee  other factors, like age, can affect your chances,"" says Dr. Davis. 7. Is your period regular? If you have an irregular cycle that is very long (more than 36 days) or short (less than 22 days), it's possible that your ovaries aren't functioning normally, and that could have an impact on the viability of your eggs when you try to get pregnant. Every woman's cycle is different, but see your doctor to rule out possible medical causes, such as thyroid disease or polycystic ovarian syndrome; both can be detected by blood tests and treated. Fibroids, which can cause heavy periods, may also interfere with fertility and are also easily treated. Fortunately, if you are not ovulating normally when you want to conceive, there are a number of medications that can correct the problem. 8. Are you under a lot of stress? It isn't clear whether daily stress has an effect on one's chances of getting pregnant. Some experts think it may decrease the production of estrogen, but others find no link. It's a bit of a chicken-and-egg issue: Infertility itself is stressful, so it's not surprising that women who seek help may report feeling tense. Depression is another matter: ""A number of studies link depression and trouble conceiving,"" says Alice Domar, Ph.D., director of the Mind/Body Center for Women's Health at Boston IVF, Harvard Medical School, and coauthor of  Conquering Infertility .  ""If you want to conceive in the future and you're having emotional problems, try to see a mental health professional,"" says Dr. Domar. But if you're sure that your emotional stress is related to pregnancy worries, you may want to join a fertility support group. It will not only give you a place to talk about your experiences but also teach you coping techniques for stress management and relaxation. To find a group in your area, visit, the website of the National Infertility Association, and click on Local Chapters. 9. Are you a healthy eater? A well-balanced diet with plenty of fruits and vegetables is always a good idea, but the average American diet provides the necessary vitamins and minerals for fertility, says Dr. Cowan. Of course, every woman of childbearing age should take a multivitamin with at least 400 micrograms of folic acid  it helps prevent neural tube defects only if you take it  before  you get pregnant. Caffeine remains controversial. Some studies indicate that it can delay conception, but others show  you guessed it  no effect. Once you do become pregnant, though, caffeine matters: As little as two cups a day can double your risk of miscarriage. Says Dr. Milad, ""I give my patients who are trying to get pregnant the same advice I give those who are pregnant - keep caffeine intake in check and take your vitamins."" So, will you be fertile in five years? There's no way to be absolutely sure, of course. The more you know, the easier it is to plan your future. And the healthier your lifestyle, the better your chances will be. The Dad Factor The male contribution to infertility has only recently received the scientific attention it deserves. Here are some questions worth asking about the aspiring father: Does he smoke?  Infertility rates are three times higher in men who smoke compared with those who don't. Just as tobacco use affects a woman's eggs, it can also cause a reduction in the number of sperm as well as damage those being formed. After a man quits, it takes about three months for his sperm to return to normal, says Dr. Davis. If he was a heavy smoker, it can take longer. What's his health history?  Mumps can cause sterility, according to Dr. Davis. Also, about 1 in 500 men have Klinefelter's syndrome, a genetic disorder that causes them to be born sterile. How old is he?  Although a man can impregnate a woman into his 70s and older, new studies make it clear that a man's fertility declines with age, beginning around 35. Both the quality and the quantity of sperm are affected. Is he okay ""down there""?  One of the biggest causes of male infertility is varicoceles, which isvaricose veins in the scrotum. These affect one in ten men. Some get them around their testicles, which can reduce sperm production. Have him see a urologist for treatment options. How's his diet?  Men who get enough folic acid, vitamin Cand zinc produce more sperm, studies show. The amounts for each in a healthy dietor a standard multivitaminare fine. Is he regularly exposed to heat?  For men who use hot tubs oftenor truck drivers who spend a lot of time sitting above a vehicle's engine,there may be a reduction in the number of sperm produced. Does he drink a lot or smoke pot?  In some men, even moderate drinking affects fertility; some researchers believe men should limit themselves to one drink a day for optimal fertility. Marijuana use can reduce the production of sperm, and heavy use is associated with infertility, says Dr. Davis. Timing the Test for Pregnancy If you're using a home pregnancy test, wait at least ten days after your period is due to try it. If you test too soon, the result may signal that you're not pregnant when you really are, says epidemiologist Donna Day Baird, Ph.D. ""The fertilized egg may not yet be implanted in the uterus by the time a woman expects her period,"" she says, ""so the test can't detect the pregnancy.""

 I Didn't Know I was Pregnant—Really!,http://www.parenting.com/article/i-didnt-know-i-was-pregnant-really,"How many times have you read a story about a pregnant woman giving  birth  in, say...an airplane, who claims she had ""no idea"" she was expecting? If you're like I used to be, you probably shook your head, give it a ""Yeah, right!"" and moved on. Recently, a 31-year-old nun in Italy was rushed to the hospital with stomach pains and delivered a healthy, full-term baby boy she named Francesco (Francis), after the pope. While I'm sure he's honored, he's got to be wondering about the real father (I know I am!). The nun simply said, ""I did not know. I only felt a stomach pain,"" wrote Daily Mail . Maybe immaculate conception? Judging by the comments on the article, most of the readers think she's full of it! Other than the hilarious jokes, the most common question was; ""How can any woman be unaware she's pregnant? Seriously."" Personally, I don't know about making it to 40 weeks without getting a clue, but as embarrassing as it is, I can admit that I got to 23 weeksyep, five and a half monthsbefore I realized I was pregnant! I can explain, really! While carrying my seventh baby, I started showing signs of pre-eclampsia, but test after test ruled it out. At only 24 weeks, I had to stay in the hospital while they tried to figure out what was going on. Unfortunately, they discovered I had kidney and vascular disease, but thankfully the baby was stable. At 37 weeks, I delivered my healthy son, Justin, who was welcomed to the family by his daddy, five big brothers and one big sister. My doctors made it very clear that for my own safety, I couldn't have any more children. Justin was such a sweet and mellow baby. The only problem I had was with breastfeeding. Because of the kidney disease, I had trouble making enough milk to feed him. By the time he was 2 months old, I ended up using a Supplemental Nursing System ( SNS ); a feeding tube that attaches to your nipple and a container of formula so baby gets enough nutrition while still breastfeeding. I felt awful, no doubt from my hormones, but he took to it with no problem. After a few months, my breasts hurt so much! I figured his latch was different than I was used to and ignored it. After having no issues with the SNS for weeks, Justin started to push away from my breast and grumble. From experience, I assumed my cycle was going to start soon. With my other babies, I could actually tell from how they acted and from the smell of the milk. With formula involved, I could only go by Justin's behavior. I waited and waited, but no period, which was fine by me! I didn't think it was a big deal because with breastfeeding there's really no set time for your period to return. Every day, I would put Justin into the sling, put my toddlers in a stroller and go to the park close to our house. I started getting so tired I could barely make it out the door. I also had horrible gas pains, but I don't think I want to go there! Eventually, I mentioned to my doctor that I was having a lot of nausea, fatigue and bloating. He said they were common side effects from one of my medications and prescribed a nursing-safe anti-nausea drug. I went on my merry way and didn't think anything about it. Then came the time to figure out what type of birth control I was going to use. My nephrologist (kidney doctor) wanted me to talk to the OB/GYN about having my tubes tied. Laying on the exam table in that most uncomfortable position, I heard a gasp followed by ""Oh, Margie"" (in that voice your dad used when you brought home a bad report card). I even felt ashamed for a second before I blurted out, ""Wait, what? What did I do?"" He stood up and said, ""You are so pregnant."" After the ""you can't have this baby or you'll die"" conversation, he sent me straight to the imaging department for an ultrasound. I called my husband to meet me there; both of us were in total shock. We thought we'd been pretty careful; besides, I was breastfeeding full-time! We sat in stunned silence as the measurements were calculated and we were told I was about 23 weeks along and he would be Boy No. 7. Looking back, I think using the SNS and Justin's nibbles of solid foods allowed for me to ovulate. After going against the medical advice of four doctors, we decided to keep our baby. He was nearly at a viable stage, and I wasn't comfortable with the other option. After making the decision, the biggest obstacle was dealing with our teenagers, who were understandably angry. At 34 weeks, Adam was born via emergency Cesarean due to a placental abruption. As they were knocking me out, I started yelling, ""Tie my tubes! Don't forget to tie my tubes!"" When I hear the ""I had no idea..."" stories now, I sympathize a little more, but I still wonder about making it the full nine months without knowing. I still laugh to myself, a little . My surprise baby, Adam, is 8 years old now and truly my ""baby"" in every way. I baby him too much, and he eats it up and works it like a pro! Whenever I tell the story of my pregnancy with him, I always give the little preamble: ""You know those crazy women who give birth on airplanes?""  Shutterstock image"
 Mealtime Makeovers,http://www.parenting.com/article/mealtime-makeovers,"A child's  diet  is a work in progress. Just when you think you've figured out what he'll eat-- and won't-- his preferences change all over again. So you wonder whether he's eating well enough. As a mother of three, I wonder the same thing. But as a registered dietitian, I know that even if a kid turns up his nose at vegetables, refuses to drink milk, or won't touch any meat except chicken nuggets, it rarely spells dietary doom. Chances are, your child's eating habits are healthier than you think, even if they could use some improvement. That's what three families found when they participated in our diet makeovers. We asked the parents to write down everything their kids ate for three days. Then we compared each child's average daily nutritional intake against what's recommended by age and found kid-approved ways for him or her to eat better. Registered dietitian Elizabeth Ward's latest book is  Healthy Foods, Healthy Kids.   Sarah: Running on Air? Janet Zalewski marvels at her 2-year-old's energy level. ""I always wonder whether Sarah's eating enough,"" says the Chicago mom. Although she's encouraged by her toddler's curiosity about food-- ""Like my husband, Mike, she'll try anything once""-- she worries when Sarah sometimes won't eat what she's served. ""If she doesn't like what I make, should I offer other foods that I know she'll eat?"" It also bothers her that Sarah loves fatty foods, especially salami, hot dogs, and sausages. ""Since I'm always sure she'll eat them, I keep hot dogs in the house for a quick and easy meal,"" admits Zalewski. (To prevent choking in kids younger than 4, cut hot dogs and sausages into small pieces-- and avoid hard candies like M&M's.) Problems-- and solutions.  Sarah drinks milk at most meals and likes ice cream and yogurt, so she's well nourished in calcium and protein. But all those hot dogs and other processed meats give her too much heart-unhealthy saturated fat and sodium-- without providing enough iron. Switching to leaner cuts of pork and beef will reduce the fat, boost iron, and lower her intake of potentially harmful sodium nitrite. Other good iron sources: eggs and iron-fortified ready-to-eat cereals. Sarah could also benefit from boosting her intake of dietary fiber. For example, she could, as often as possible, switch from white to whole-wheat bread, from french fries to baked potatoes, and from juice to whole fruit. There's no need for Sarah's mom to cater to her food preferences; she just needs to continue to offer a variety of nutrient-rich foods. Left to their own devices, 2-year-olds eat when they're hungry, consuming more during growth spurts, which occur less frequently than when they were babies. And Sarah's a remarkably consistent and interested eater for her age. One month later.  Sarah's eating fewer processed meats and more tuna fish, eggs, and PB&J and grilled cheese sandwiches. Zalewski switched her from white to whole-grain breads for toast and sandwiches. She's boosting Sarah's fruit (and fiber) intake with a few fruit smoothies a week. A tougher challenge: limiting juice consumption. ""We're both working on it,"" she says.  Sarah's Typical Day Breakfast    1/4 cup 100% fruit juice mixed with 1/4 cup water   3/8 cup 2% milk   1 scrambled egg, made with 2 tablespoons 2% milk and 1/2 teaspoon butter   1 slice white bread (1 oz) Lunch    Sandwich: 1 slice white bread (1 oz) and 1 tablespoon peanut butter   3 grapes, quartered   2 pretzel twists   1 nectarine   14 plain M&M's   5/8 cup 2% milk Snack    1/4 cup 100% juice mixed with 1/4 cup water   1/4 cup grapes, quartered Dinner    1 hot dog (no bun), cut up   7 French fries   1/2 cup lemonade   1/2 cup soft-serve vanilla ice cream Snack   1 squeezable yogurt (2 oz)   3/8 cup 2% milk  Fernando: Full at Mealtimes Fernando Plata, 3, of Miami dawdles at dinner. Lunch and breakfast as well. ""He eats very slowly,"" says his father, Ignacio. He just doesn't seem to be hungry enough to eat much of his meals, Ignacio says. When his mom, Patricia, tries to speed up the pace, mealtime can get tense. Like his younger brother, 1-year-old Daniel, Fernando still drinks milk from a bottle, yet he's mastered drinking from a cup. ""Even though we don't think he eats a lot,"" says Ignacio, ""his doctor says he's doing fine."" Problems-- and solutions.  Fernando's not hungry because he drinks too much! He consumes 18 ounces of whole milk (often with cereal added) from the bottle every day-- plus lots of fruit juice and soft drinks. Frequent snacking with large portions-- a big bowlful of Goldfish (270 calories) plus a cup of Gatorade (60 calories)-- also suppresses his mealtime appetite. Over time, this dietary pattern could contribute to a weight problem. Fernando eats fast-food hamburgers frequently, which helps him meet his dietary needs for iron and zinc, and all that milk gives more than twice the necessary calcium. But the high-fat foods give him too much saturated fat, not to mention excess protein and calories. It's time to break the bottle habit, for developmental as well as dental reasons; later, he can switch to low-fat milk. Eating smaller, more nutritious snacks (such as whole-wheat pretzels or half a sandwich on whole wheat) would help enhance nutrition without squelching his desire for meals. One month later.  Fernando's off sugary soft drinks and downs no more than about four ounces of juice (a half cup) twice a day. Instead of chips and crackers, he snacks on child-size portions of yogurt. He's also eating more whole-grain cereals. His appetite at mealtime has improved. Breaking the bottle habit will have to wait until the Platas return from a long overseas vacation-- Fernando's parents don't want to try such a big change until they're back home. He's also still very fond of high-fat fast-food meals.  Fernando's Typical Day Snack    Bottle: 8 oz whole milk mixed with 2 tablespoons oatmeal-banana cereal Breakfast    4 mini-waffles with 2 tablespoons syrup   1/2 cup Fruit Loops and 4 oz whole milk Snack    2 oz Goldfish crackers (about 100)   1 cup Gatorade Lunch    1 cup homemade vegetable soup with 2 oz chicken   2 fast-food chicken nuggets   1/2 small order of fast-food French fries   1/2 cup soft drink   1/2 cup cubed melon Dinner    1 cup homemade vegetable soup with 2 oz chicken   1 cup macaroni and cheese   2 slices of kiwifruit Snack    Bottle: 6 oz whole milk mixed with 2 tablespoons oatmeal-banana cereal   Adrian: Dream Eater Adrian Hale, 5, of Bedford, MA, is an adventurous eater-- in part because his mom, Jean, resists preparing special meals for him and his sister, 3. ""I always serve Adrian and Jaqueline what Mike and I are having for dinner because it's important to expose them to new foods."" If they don't try them the first time, they may the second-- or the tenth. One of Adrian's favorite dinners: grilled salmon teriyaki, broccoli, pasta, and milk. The family's culinary open-mindedness has a downside: Adrian relies on an ever-changing menu. He's a fickle customer. Says Hale, ""It's tough to keep up-- I never know what he'll reject next."" Problems-- and solutions.  Variety gives Adrian a big nutritional boost: He gets plenty of iron and zinc even though he takes in fewer calories than suggested for his age. (Because Adrian's growing properly, calories aren't an issue.) More milk would give him more calcium and vitamin D. Since plain milk isn't his favorite, he could try low-fat chocolate milk and smoothies made from low-fat milk and fruit. Cheese and calcium-fortified orange juice are also good choices, although they lack vitamin D. Adrian could eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, though he still does better than most kids. One month later.  Adrian has doubled his whole-grain consumption and cut his juice intake by half. When he does drink juice, it's often orange juice with added calcium. Fortified drinkable yogurt has supplied some missing calcium and vitamin D. Adding chocolate bumped up Adrian's milk intake for a while, but then he lost interest; fruit smoothies didn't fly. Neither did gazpacho or cucumber salad. But Adrian does like sliced cucumbers and celery. He's also increasingly interested in learning about the links between eating right and feeling strong.  Adrian's Typical Day Breakfast    1 hard-boiled egg white   1/2 slice whole-wheat toast with 1/2 teaspoon butter   5/8 cup 2% milk   1/4 cup chopped watermelon Lunch    1/2 peanut butter-and-rhubarb-jelly sandwich on whole-wheat bread   1/2 cup 100% grape juice   5 jelly beans Dinner    2 oz steak teriyaki   1/4 cup edamame (soybeans)   1 cup cooked pasta with 1 teaspoon grated parmesan cheese and 1 teaspoon butter   1/2 cup vanilla yogurt Snack    1/2 cup Bran Flakes cereal with 1/2 chopped banana and 1/2 cup 2% milk   A Too-Rich Diet Like Sarah, Fernando, and Adrian, most American kids take in more protein than they need, and more than two-thirds of those between ages 2 and 6 consume more saturated fat than is healthy. Protein.  It's a key building block of all cells, yet it doesn't take much to meet a child's needs. For example, eight ounces of milk (one cup) and one ounce of cooked meat (the size of a third of a deck of cards) supply all the protein a 3-year-old needs in a day. For a 5-year-old, just add one more ounce of meat and another cup of milk. Extra protein won't hurt a child with healthy kidneys, but it can crowd out nutrient-rich vegetables and fruit. Saturated Fat.  A childhood diet high in this type of fat can raise blood-cholesterol levels and lead to heart disease in adulthood if dietary patterns don't change. Starting at age 2, children should get no more than ten percent of their calories from saturated fat, although it's okay to make the shift gradually. Trans fatty acids (from partially hydrogenated oils) have similar effects. To cut back on saturated and trans fats, choose leaner cuts of meat, switch from whole to low-fat milk and dairy products, minimize fried fast foods, and limit high-fat commercial baked goods and snacks.  Taste-Test Tips When introducing new foods:     Offer one new food at a time  along with familiar ones. This lets your child approach it without pressure.    Allow her to explore.  She learns about foods-- especially new ones-- by touching, smelling, and even playing with them. She might even try a taste!    Make mealtimes pleasant.  It's hard for your child to try something new when he's distracted. Turn off the TV, computer, and loud music, then eat with him or at least sit with him while he eats.    Cook together.  Kids as young as 3 take pride in dishes they've helped create and may be more likely to taste them.    Relax.  It may take ten or more exposures to a new food before your child accepts it. Forcing kids to try something before they're ready just fosters resistance. And don't give up: What's yucky in June may be peachy in July.  Who Needs a Vitamin Pill? Nobody's diet is perfect, least of all a child's. That's why a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement can make sense for many kids. Always check with your pediatrician about your child's individual needs. Best bet: a kids' chewable multi (or a liquid for ages 2 and under) that supplies no more than 100% of the Daily Value for the nutrients on the label. Children who don't eat meat or poultry may need one with iron too."
 When Breast and Bottle Both Are Best,http://www.parenting.com/article/when-breast-and-bottle-both-are-best,"Like many  pregnant  women, Clara James planned to exclusively breastfeed her baby-to-be throughout his first year of life -- as much for the nutritional benefits as for the bonding time nursing would provide. And at first, it looked as though the 39-year-old New York City mom's dreams would come true. Even after a difficult cesarean section, baby Zach nursed in the hospital, latching on well. But once home, Clara's blissful ideas of breastfeeding were turned upside down. ""If Zach wasn't on the breast, he was crying,"" she remembers. ""The lactation consultant I called weighed him after a feeding and said she wasn't sure he was getting enough milk. But she told me not to supplement and to put him on my breast as often as he wanted to be there, which was every hour and a half."" She followed the consultant's instructions, using a supplemental nutrition system (or SNS, a device that allows milk to be suspended in a container around a woman's neck and delivered to a feeding baby through a tube laid next to the woman's nipple) while she breastfed as well as pumping in between feedings. Clara, who was taking a few months off from her job, managed to keep up with this grueling schedule for several weeks. Eventually -- rundown, tearful, and anxious about her baby -- she developed mastitis. Zach got thrush (a yeast infection of the mouth) from Clara's antibiotics, Clara herself got nipple thrush, and, on top of all that, Zach was still crying all the time. Meanwhile, she hadn't slept for more than a two-hour stretch since she'd given birth. ""Because of the terrible fatigue and my anxiety over his not gaining much weight,"" she says, ""I thought I might have to give up breastfeeding altogether, which I really didn't want to do."" Fortunately, Clara's pediatrician took one look at the crying, unhappy baby and mom on the verge and advised Clara to supplement with formula, right away. Although her lactation consultant had warned her against it, she felt that she had exhausted all other options. Almost immediately, the situation improved. Zach, finally satisfied, switched easily between breast and bottle. Clara's anxiety lifted, she got more sleep, and she began bonding with Zach during feedings. ""I guess I just needed someone to give me permission to supplement,"" she says. ""It made our lives easier, and we still had the advantages of breastfeeding. But no one ever told me I could do it."" Doing the Combo Okay, before an army of lactation consultants rises up in protest, let's be clear: No one is questioning whether breastfeeding is best. It's not only the clear nutritional choice, but it provides a closeness to one's infant that borders on magical. But let's also finally admit it: Breastfeeding exclusively is extremely difficult for some 10 to 20 percent of women, says James Sargent, M.D., a pediatrician and researcher at Dartmouth Medical School, in Lebanon, New Hampshire. And according to  Babyalk  contributing editor and lactation specialist Marianne Neifert, M.D., author of  Dr. Mom's Guide to Breastfeeding  and one of the country's top experts on the subject, up to 5 percent of women suffer from breast milk shortage, making exclusive breastfeeding practically impossible. But when one of these frustrated moms hears from ardent breastfeeding advocates that she shouldn't supplement with a bottle (let alone formula), she may decide to abandon breastfeeding altogether, thinking it's an all-or-nothing proposition. ""Moms are often told very strongly that regardless of how hard a time they're having, they should breastfeed exclusively,"" says Dr. Sargent. ""But that may not always be appropriate. The downsides (ranging from a distressed baby and a miserable mother to a malnourished and dehydrated infant) can actually outweigh the benefits."" The answer for many women who struggle with exclusive nursing may be to combine breastfeeding with bottlefeeding. Many experts agree that some breastfeeding is better than none at all. A Medical Necessity Clara's situation -- her baby simply wasn't getting enough breast milk -- is one in which a breast/bottle combo may be medically necessary. Usually, your child will give you an indication that feeding's just not going right, but for many moms, it takes a good pediatrician to back up their hunch. ""If I see a newborn who just seems miserable and hungry and who cries all the time, I look at that very seriously,"" says Dr. Neifert. ""It can't be a positive early life experience for a baby who is frantically hungry to be put to the breast and not get enough milk."" If you suspect that breastfeeding isn't satisfying your baby, ask your baby's doctor to help you confirm the problem. Your baby's weight is a good indicator of how well she's feeding, and there are two ways to evaluate this. Since newborns shouldn't lose more than 10 percent of their birth weight in the first few days of life and should surpass it by 2 weeks of age, your pediatrician may weigh your infant while she's naked to compare her current weight with her birth weight. Another weight test involves what doctors call a ""representative feeding,"" which will give your pediatrician an idea of how much milk your baby takes at a typical breastfeeding. To do this, he'll weigh your baby with her clothes on, ask you to nurse her, and then reweigh her in the same clothes. The change in her weight after a feeding represents the amount of milk she drank from your breasts. ""By two to three weeks of age, for example,"" says Dr. Neifert, ""a baby should be taking in about one ounce of milk per hour. So, we would expect her to have gained about two ounces two hours after she nursed. If the gain is considerably less than this, there may be a problem."" Dr. Neifert also suggests that you ask your ob-gyn to do a thorough ""lactation assessment,"" which should include a medical history to uncover any conditions, such as breast surgery or hormone problems, that could interfere with successful breastfeeding. Ask your doctor to evaluate your breast appearance as well -- including size, shape, and symmetry. Some women, says Dr. Neifert, through no fault of their own, have underdeveloped breasts that render them unable to make enough milk, and small-breasted women may have to nurse more often because their breasts may not hold as much milk, increasing the chance of nipple sores, cracks, and bleeding. ""This is a biological difference in women that no one will admit to,"" says Dr. Neifert. When faced with a mom who is physically unable to supply enough breast milk to her baby, Dr. Neifert usually recommends what she calls a ""triple feeding"": 1.  Temporarily restrict the duration of breastfeeding to 20 minutes (10 minutes per side). 2.  When you finish breastfeeding, have your spouse or another caregiver feed the baby as much extra milk (either previously expressed breast milk or formula) as necessary to satisfy her. (A breastfed baby often accepts a bottle more readily from another caretaker because she expects to breastfeed from her mother.) 3.  While your baby is drinking her supplement, use an electric double breastpump for 10 minutes to extract any residual milk in your breasts and stimulate additional production. Refrigerate the milk you express. 4.  At the next feeding, repeat the cycle. After breastfeedding, supplement first with your expressed milk, then offer additional formula as needed. Over time, says Dr. Neifert, triple feedings will help build up your milk supply while assuring your baby is adequately nourished, and you may be able to return to exclusive breastfeeding if you wish to. The rigors of a triple feeding schedule aren't for every woman: some are too exhausted or have too many other responsibilities to devote the necessary time and energy to this demanding regimen. ""It's important for the mother to choose whether she feels she can add in pumping,"" says Dr. Neifert. If you'd rather not, you might want to follow the instructions below. What's Best for You? Even when the baby's weight is not a problem, maternal complications like physical illness, mastitis, nipple pain, clogged ducts, fatigue, anxiety, or postpartum depression can interfere with a woman's enjoyment of breastfeeding and her commitment to continue. In such cases, says Dr. Neifert, ""if a mom's emotional well-being is at risk because she keeps trying and trying and it's still not a rewarding experience, we have to assess whether it's realistic for her to exclusively breastfeed. Many moms who are having a great deal of trouble and are ready to quit will breastfeed longer if they see it as doable for them"" -- doable, in other words, by combining breast- and bottlefeeding. Consider 41-year-old magazine editor Jane Peterson's experience. ""When I had Ben six years ago, there was less awareness than there is today about what to do when you had breastfeeding problems,"" she says. Jane had planned to breastfeed exclusively for several months, but within the first week, she experienced a number of problems. ""Ben wanted to nurse every hour,"" says the Cleveland, OH, mom. ""He was a big baby, and he was hungry! He was gaining weight and my milk supply was fine, but I wasn't sleeping. Into the second week, my nipples were sore, cracked, and bleeding, Ben was still feeding once an hour, and in the evenings he would have a colicky period and cry for hours. My life was a blur of exhaustion and pain."" Jane knew pumping was out of the question because her breasts were far too sore and raw, and she knew that when she went back to work she wouldn't be in an environment where pumping was appropriate. At that point, Jane called her sister, who had nursed two babies, and told her she couldn't go on. ""I sobbed and sobbed,"" she says. ""My sister said, 'Jane, give him a bottle of formula, now.'"" The next evening she had her husband give Ben a bottle in the next room. A little while later her husband came in carrying a sleeping Ben and gave her the thumbs up. That night, Ben slept for several hours straight -- and so did his exhausted mom. The difference was in the formula: It remains in Baby's stomach longer than breast milk (which is more rapidly digested by Baby's immature system), and that extra hour or two break from feeding can make all the difference. Making It Work When Jane decided to combine breast and bottle, she had no idea how to do so. With her sister's help, she developed her own plan, introducing the first bottle at night, an hour or two after her evening breastfeed. ""That way my husband could give Ben the bottle and I could sleep through that feeding,"" she explains. Then, as Jane neared the end of her maternity leave, she started to introduce another bottlefeed every four or five days, until she was offering a bottle at every other feeding. (According to Dr. Neifert, waiting four to seven days before eliminating another breastfeed will help a nursing mother avoid clogged ducts and even mastitis caused by insufficiently emptied breasts.) ""That worked out well,"" Jane explains. ""It gave my milk supply time to adjust, and it gave Ben time to adjust as well. Since I worked from nine to five, I was eventually able to breastfeed first thing in the morning and last thing at night for a long time.""  According to Dr. Sargent, Jane introduced the bottle at the perfect point. If an infant is not losing weight, and if you can make it through the first ten days to two weeks breastfeeding exclusively, it may be best to delay supplementation in order to build up your milk supply and let you and your baby get used to breastfeeding. ""At this point, substituting a supplemental feeding should make no difference at all in terms of whether or not you're able to keep up breastfeeding,"" says Dr. Sargent. Waiting a few months to introduce the combo is also okay, says Dr. Neifert: ""Every baby adapts differently to new experiences. It may take a little longer for an older breastfed baby to accept a bottle, but it can work."" For many women, combining breast with bottle is simply the best choice for them and their baby. ""Doing the combo allowed me to have the best of both worlds,"" says Jane. ""Only then did I experience the bliss of breastfeeding -- after I was able to heal my sore breasts and finally get some sleep."" Donna Jackson writes for many national magazines and has two children."
 The Power of Prenatal Yoga,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/project-pregnancy/ashley-fraxedas/power-prenatal-yoga,"22w3d-  Ive mentioned my love of sports a few times now. So when I got pregnant, it was a huge shock to my system (both physically and emotionally) to cut out some of the activities I loved. I always heard that you could continue doing during your pregnancy what you were doing before. But my doctor advised otherwise, and I listened. No softball, no running, no spin class, no getting your heart rate above 140 Whats a girl to do without spin class?! This void, coupled with a ridiculous case of eczema, had me questioning why anyone would ever have more than one kid. For the first few months, I really lost who I was. Enter prenatal yoga. Ill be honest. I had always assumed yoga was for people who didnt like high-impact sports. I went to one yoga class at my gym and thought it was just plain boring. Boy was I wrong. At 13 weeks, after I announced to the world that I was pregnant, I went to my first yoga class at a local studio. After the first 5 minutes, I was in love. Yoga has so many benefits. During pregnancy (and Im sure after pregnancy) its helping me mentally. Its something I look forward to each week. During the class, I focus on how my body is feeling. I focus on my breathing. And I focus on how proud I am of myself. It sounds silly, but Im proud of how Im handling my changing life and body, especially when dealing with crazy debilitating symptoms. The teacher is positive, calm, a mom of four boys and has the most radiant positive energy. Its contagious. And it doesnt hurt that she occasionally comes up and gives you a hand massage while youre in childs pose. Its also one of the best workouts Ive ever done. Theres nothing boring about it. I leave every class with quivering quads and sore shoulders. I can feel that its keeping my ever-changing body nimble and flexible. I started having bad sciatic issues during my first trimester. After 2 weeks of yoga, the symptoms were gone. My husband has even jumped on the yoga bandwagon and does the hot yoga class while Im in my pregnancy class. Its so healthy for him to supplement his normal pick-things-up-and-put-them-down gym sessions with a class that focuses on flexibility, agility and core strength training. Above all, yoga has helped me maintain who I am and what I love throughout pregnancy. I definitely gave up too much at first. I changed my life too much and too drastically during my first trimester. Partially because I was terrified of hurting my baby. Partially because I felt awful. But now I realize how important it is to stay true to yourself. As everyone always says: You cant have a healthy baby without a healthy mom. And part of being healthy physically is staying healthy mentally. During our 20-week ultrasound, we saw that our babys feet are way above her head. Her knees are practically in her mouth. Im pretty sure shes practicing yoga with me :) How did you learn to cope with your new pregnant self? Did you pick up any new hobbies during pregnancy to supplement others that you had to give up?"
 Ask Dr. Sears: Unemployed and Pregnant,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-unemployed-and-pregnant,"Q. My husband was just laid off and money is kind of tight. Now, I just found out I'm pregnant. How long can you go without seeing a doctor?  A.  Early prenatal care is very important for having a healthy pregnancy. Try to be checked by a healthcare provider within the first six weeks of your pregnancy. The sooner, the better. These visits are more than just a checkup: You will receive important counseling on proper nutrition during your pregnancy. You'll also get a prescription for prenatal vitamin supplements. Of course, the checkup is important too, to see if you and your baby have special medical needs. Getting Assistance Pregnancy is the time when you and your baby need medical care the most. That's why there are so many government-sponsored resources available to pregnant women. The best place to start looking for help is your local Department of Health. Call and ask about qualifications for Medicaid and other assistance programs for pregnant mothers. Since your income is low right now, you will probably qualify for state-assisted medical care throughout your pregnancy and delivery. You should also look in the phonebook for free prenatal clinics in your area. There are a lot of other things you can do for self-care during your pregnancy, and they are very economical: Read all about it.  Get a copy of  The Pregnancy Book  written by Martha, myself, and obstetrician Dr. Linda Holt (Little, Brown). This is a month-by-month guide that tells you everything you need to know about taking proper care of yourself throughout your pregnancy. You will find lots of information to increase your chances of having a safe and satisfying delivery. See if it's available at your local library or if you can borrow it from a friend. Create a healthy womb environment.  Refrain from smoking, excessive alcohol, and drugs or medications that are not prescribed by your doctor. Eat right for two. You will need an extra 300 to 500 calories and 25 grams of protein per day. Stick to nutrient-dense foods -- those that pack a lot of nutrition with fewer calories -- such as grains, lowfat yogurt, cottage cheese, tofu, salmon, eggs, vegetables, and lean meat. Avoid sugar and corn syrup-sweetened beverages. Stay away from packaged carbs that do not also contain fiber and protein. In fact, the fewer packages and boxes you open during your pregnancy, the better your nutrition will be. During your pregnancy, you'll feel more comfortable eating frequent, nutritious, mini-meals throughout the day rather than three big meals. Take your vitamins.  In addition to the daily increase in calories, you need 800 milligrams of extra calcium, 0.4 milligrams of extra folic acid, and lots of extra iron and other minerals. As a nutritional insurance policy, take a prenatal vitamin, which contains the extra vitamins and minerals you will need throughout your pregnancy. I also recommend you add omega-3 fats to your diet. A great way to do this is to eat four ounces of salmon three times a week. Of if you're not a fish-lover, take a daily supplement that contains 200 milligrams DHA -- the most vital omega-3 fat for your baby -- DHA. Keep fit.  Mothers who keep physically fit during pregnancy are more likely to grow a healthier baby and have an easier delivery. Take a brisk walk for at least 45 minutes a day during the first half of your pregnancy. During the second half, swimming is the safest all-around exercise, since it's easiest on your joints. By following these self-help medical tips, you will greatly increase your chances of enjoying a healthy pregnancy and delivering a healthy baby. And just think, to skip prenatal care may turn out to be much more costly."
 Should Babies Eat Fish?,http://www.parenting.com/article/feeding-fish-to-your-baby,"Sure, it's an untraditional baby  food , but you'll be surprised by the brain-building goodness packed inside. As a pediatrician and father of eight, I've realized how much children's health and behavior are affected--for better or worse--by what they eat. Of course, you already know how important a balanced diet full of whole grains, vegetables, fruit and lean proteins is, but one thing I always found missing from babies' diet was fish. Parents just didn't seem to think it--and other seafood--was a ""baby"" food. Over the years, study after study has supported that omega-3 fatty acids--essential nutrients found in seafood--help promote infant brain development as well as boost immunity and vision. In fact, they're good for nearly every organ, even baby's super-soft skin. Even moms can benefit: The latest research shows that women who ate adequate amounts of omega-3s during pregnancy were less likely to experience postpartum depression. Read on for advice on introducing seafood into your child's diet. Fish Talk The lowdown on which seafood is tops--and why. What types of fish are best for baby?  Salmon is by far the best source of DHA*--the star of the omega-3 world. But almost all seafood contains omega-3s, so try to give your baby a variety of low-mercury fish. How much fish should my baby eat?  For babies just starting out on solids, I recommend about 2 ounces of wild salmon per week. After your baby is off formula or breast milk, give her 6 to 7 ounces per week. If you find it difficult to reach that amount, consider a supplement. Ask your doctor for a recommendation, or try my own DHA liquid,  GoFish . Should pregnant and breastfeeding women eat more fish ? I recommend that pregnant and lactating women eat 6 ounces of wild salmon twice a week. In addition, make sure you talk to your doctor about consuming at least 650 milligrams of DHA daily from prenatal supplements. * WHAT'S DHA?  You see it on formula labels, but did you know that it's also abundant in fish? DHA, short for docosahexaenoic acid, is an omega-3 essential fatty acid vital for brain and eye development Fish Food Doubtful your baby will eat fish? Offer it early on, and it just may become a favorite food. Start with salmon, and try these tips: Don't stress it.  Blend the salmon flakes into pasta or mashed potatoes. Another option:  HappyBaby 's frozen meal of wild salmon, lentils and sweet potatoes. Spread it.  Puree cooked wild salmon (canned or steamed fresh) with lemon, olive oil and seasonings and then spread it on bread or crackers. Strip it down.  Older babies might enjoy ""fish fingers."" Dip inch-wide strips of deboned salmon fillets into beaten egg and coat them with a mixture of whole-wheat flour, whole-wheat bread crumbs, Parmesan cheese and a dash of salt. Bake for about eight minutes. Mercury Meter Some seafood has too much methylmercury, a toxin that can affect the brain. Here's a checklist of safe, low-mercury fish you can give baby: canned light tuna, cod, catfish, pollock and salmon. Other safe seafood includes shrimp, clams, crab and scallops. My favorite website for buying safe seafood is  vitalchoice.com ."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Advantages of Goat's Milk,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-advantages-of-goats-milk,"Q. What are the benefits of feeding my baby goat's milk? I've heard it can improve  digestion , especially in infants over one year old. Is this true? A.  I frequently advise goat's milk for patients in my pediatric practice, especially those who have digestive problems or who are unable to tolerate cow's milk. In infants who show an intolerance to cow's milksymptoms of this can include colicky abdominal pain, bloating, diarrheaand facial rashesparents often report that many of these allergic reactions disappear or greatly improve after switching to goat's milk. Here are the reasons why goat's milk is more easily digested and less allergenic than cow's milk in many infants Less allergenic proteins The protein clumps that are formed by the action of the stomach acids on the protein are called curds. The softer the curd, the quicker it passes through the stomach. Goat's milk protein forms a softer curd, which makes it easier to digest. This could be an advantage for infants who spit up a lot or who have  gastroesophageal reflux (GER) . Goat's milk contains only trace amounts of the allergenic protein found in cow's milkalpha-S1 casein. However, goat's milk and cow's milk both contain another type of allergenic protein, beta-lactoglobulin, which is why some infants who are allergic to cow's milk may also be allergic to goat's milk A more digestible fat The fat globules in goat's milk are easier to digest because they contain a higher proportion of short and medium-chain fatty acids. It's a biochemical quirk that allows the intestinal enzymes to digest the fat easier. Cow's milk contains more of the longer-chain fatty acids that require more work for the intestines to digest Slightly less lactose While both cow's milk and goat's milk contain the sugar lactose, goat's milk contains slightly less (4.1 percent versus 4.7 percent in cow's milk). It's possible that this is a slight advantage for infants who are lactose intolerant Cautions about goat's milk: The vitamin and mineral content of goat's milk and  cow's milk  are fairly similar, though goat's milk contains a bit more calcium, vitamin B6, vitamin A, potassium, niacin, copperand the antioxidant selenium. On the other hand, cow's milk contains more vitamin B12 and much more folic acid. Since goat's milk contains less than ten percent of the amount of folic acid contained in cow's milk, it must be supplemented with folic acid. For this reason, be sure you get a goat's milk that is supplemented with folic acid, which the best brands usually are (If you're unsure of a good brand, I recommend Meyenberg goat milk to my patients.). Also, be sure to buy goat's milk that's certified ""free of bovine growth hormone (BGH) and antibiotics."" Generally, the American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend the use of goat's or cow's milk products in infants under one year because they can cause intestinal irritation and anemia. Infants under one year of age who are allergic to cow's milk-based formulas, soy formulasor hypoallergenic formulas are sometimes put on goat's milk formula, but only with consultation from baby's doctor or a pediatric nutritionist."
 Finding the Right Baby Formula,http://www.parenting.com/article/finding-the-right-baby-formula,"Many a new mom stands in the formula aisle, takes one look, and instantly feels overwhelmed. Who wouldn't? Between the organics, the fortifieds, the generics, the premixes and powders, it's nearly impossible to know which one will be right for your baby (and you). Our guide will help take the guesswork out of your next shopping trip. Q. I'm a savvy shopper and am curious about generic formulas. Do they contain the same key ingredients as brand-name formulas? All formulas must meet the nutrient standards set by the Food and Drug Administration, and generic formulas are nutritionally sound, says William Klish, M.D., professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston, TX. However, they don't always have the added supplements that many brand names do. Q. I find the labels confusing. Any tips on how to best interpret what's there? There is a ton of information to decipher, says Ann Condon-Meyers, a clinical nutritionist at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. It's always good to ask your pediatrician what she recommends, since there are reasons to give certain babies a specific type. Assuming you can start with the basics, the first thing to look for is one that's iron-fortified. You'll also see brands that contain DHA and ARA, two fatty acids that are abundant in breast milk and can enhance development of the brain, eyes, and nervous system. The research on the benefits of these supplements is growing, and doctors are increasingly recommending them. These formulas may be a bit pricier, but they're very likely worth the splurge. Q. What's the difference between premixed and dry formula? And if I use dry, does it matter what sort of water I mix it with? The two types are equivalent -- the premixed formulas simply already have water added to them, Condon-Meyers says. ""If you find yourself in a situation where you're unsure of the water supply, or if you're sending your baby to daycare and you want to make sure no mistakes are made in the mixing process, consider buying premixed formula,"" she adds. ""If you use powdered, many doctors suggest sterilizing the water in the early months; after that, tap water is fine."" Boil the water for a few minutes -- especially if you have well water -- and then let it cool to room temperature before mixing. Q. Should I go organic? I've read that some contain more sugar than regular formula. Nutritionally, the organic formulas are the same as any other, says Dr. Klish. And though some do contain sucrose, which may be a bit sweeter than other sugars, it's still on par with sugars in other formulas. The bottom line? ""This is more of an emotional decision than a health one,"" says Dr. Klish. If living an organic lifestyle is important to your family, then by all means go for it -- just be prepared to spend extra. Compare Baby Formula"
 Lactation Cookies Boost Nutrients and Milk Supply,http://www.parenting.com/article/lactation-cookies-boost-nutrients-and-milk-supply,"Lactation cookies may be the best-kept secret among breastfeeding mothers. The ingredients in these yummy cookies work in a number of different ways to help moms boost and maintain their milk supply. What makes these cookies so special is that they contain galactagogues, which are substances that promote lactation in humans and animals. Galactagogues can be found in various herbs and foods . The brewer's yeast, wheat germ, flaxseed meal and whole oats in lactation cookies are what specifically help with a lactating mother's milk supply. Brewer's yeast, most commonly known for its use in the production of beer, contains iron, protein, B vitamins, chromium, selenium and various other trace minerals. Not only does it promote milk supply, it is believed to help with fatigue and the ""baby blues."" Wheat germ is beneficial because it contains zinc, which is a must for breastfeeding. Zinc aids the immune system and even helps to protect cracked nipples, a common occurrence when breastfeeding. Like brewer's yeast, it is also believed to help with postpartum depression. Oats are another must for breastfeeding mothers. They are high in fiber and full of iron, protein and complex carbohydrates. Low levels of iron in the body can actually reduce milk supply. Flaxseed has good fats and enzymes, which are important for increasing the content of breast milk. Anyone can eat lactation cookies, even dads, since they are high in nutrients that everybody needs.

 The 5 Nutrients All Babies Need,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-5-nutrients-all-babies-need,"IRON Why babies need it Iron is critical for brain development -- research shows a lack of this mineral can lead to thought-processing and motor deficiencies. The good news is that infants are born with large iron stores, usually enough to satisfy their needs until 4 to 6 months of age. Premature babies, however, may miss out on some or all of the significant iron accumulation that occurs during the last trimester of pregnancy. This, coupled with their ""catch-up"" growth rates, may deplete their supply by two to three months. If your baby was born early, ask your pediatrician if she needs an iron supplement. Daily dose Formula meets iron needs for the first year, but breast milk doesn't, which is why pediatricians recommend introducing high-iron food early on in the second half of the first year, when you start your baby on solid foods (just remember to always finely chop round, firm foods until your child is 4 to avoid choking hazards). At 7 to 12 months, babies need 11 milligrams of elemental iron per day, and by 1 to 3 years old, 7 milligrams daily. Serve it up After your baby is 6 months old, two servings of iron-fortified baby cereal (one-half ounce each) provide the 11 milligrams your baby needs, so make cereal your go-to first solid food. Meat, poultry and fish are naturally iron-packed; try giving ground beef or turkey, chicken and halibut to your little eater. Other rich sources include avocado, baked potato, broccoli, chickpeas, eggs, prunes, soybeans and spinach. Good to know Iron deficiency is the most common nutritional deficiency among U.S. children. To prevent it, make sure your pediatrician screens your baby for iron-deficiency anemia at 12 months and 18 months. CALCIUM Why babies need it This mineral helps children achieve peak bone mass, necessary for building strong bones and preventing fractures when they start climbing trees and playing sports. Daily dose Breast milk and formula meet your baby's calcium needs for the first year. Once you switch to whole milk, your baby will need 500 milligrams daily. Serve it up A cup of whole milk or 6 ounces of yogurt each provides about 250 milligrams, making both bone-building powerhouses. Babies under age 1 shouldn't have cow's milk, but yogurt is typically fine once you introduce solids. Other good choices are cheese, salmon, calcium-fortified orange juice, tofu, broccoli, white beans, tomatoes and oatmeal. Good to know Helping your baby develop a taste for low-fat dairy will serve him well when he gets close to puberty and his calcium needs soar (1,300 milligrams a day at age 9!), since calcium is absorbed best from food. Babies who are overweight and at risk for obesity, or who have a strong family history of early-onset cardiovascular disease, can have reduced-fat 2 percent milk between 12 and 24 months. ZINC Why babies need it Besides having a positive effect on cognition and development, zinc's primary roles are to maintain immune function and assure optimal cell growth and repair. Zinc deficiency is associated with impaired growth, increased susceptibility to infection and an increased risk of diarrhea. Daily dose Formula meets needs through age 1, but breast milk doesn't, so it's important to introduce zinc-rich foods in the second half of the first year. Children from 7 months to 3 years of age need 3 milligrams a day. Serve it up Three ounces of pork tenderloin has 2 milligrams, a cup of yogurt has 1.6 milligrams, and half a chicken breast has 1 milligram. Other good sources include turkey, beef, fish, eggs, lentils, whole milk, cheddar cheese and fortified cereal. Good to know Zinc is most commonly found in iron -- rich meat, poultry and fish, so if you're meeting your baby's iron needs, chances are she's getting enough zinc too. VITAMINS A, D, E, AND K Why babies need them   Vitamin A promotes proper vision and healthy skin. Vitamin D increases calcium absorption and helps with bone growth -- a deficiency can cause bone-weakening rickets. Vitamin E's antioxidant powers facilitate cell growth and the development of the nervous system. Vitamin K helps with normal blood clotting. Daily dose A shot of vitamin K is administered to newborns at birth to help prevent bleeding into the brain. Infant formula meets needs through age 1 for vitamins A, D and E. To get enough vitamin D, breastfed babies should take a supplement, such as Tri-Vi-Sol (which also contains vitamins A and C), that provides 400 IU of vitamin D daily until they are weaned from the breast or are taking 15 or more ounces of formula daily. Otherwise, if you offer your baby a variety of foods from the food pyramid -- fruits, vegetables, dairy, whole grains, healthy fats -- and your doctor says she is growing appropriately for her age, she is likely meeting her needs for these fat-soluble vitamins. Serve it up Beyond breast milk, formula and cow's milk, good sources of vitamin A include carotene-rich fruits and vegetables such as carrots, sweet potatoes and broccoli. Vitamin D occurs in few foods -- which is why the AAP recommends a daily supplement for breastfed babies -- but your baby can get some from fortified cow's milk, egg yolks and fish. Vitamin E-rich foods include vegetable oils, cereals and grains. Cow's milk, leafy vegetables, fruit and soybean oil are full of vitamin K. Good to know A recent study found that 40 percent of infants and toddlers have low levels of vitamin D, which can weaken bones. Make sure you talk to your pediatrician about starting your baby on a vitamin D supplement if you are breastfeeding. VITAMINS C AND B Why babies need them Vitamin C improves iron absorption and helps prevent scurvy, a condition that causes large bruises on the body. B vitamins, including folic acid, enhance the immune and nervous systems, maintain healthy skin and muscle tone, promote cell growth and regulate metabolism. Daily dose If you offer your baby a variety of foods from the food pyramid -- fruits, vegetables, dairy, whole grains, healthy fats -- and your doctor says she is growing appropriately for her age, she is likely getting enough of these water-soluble vitamins. Serve it up Vitamin C is in citrus, tomatoes, strawberries, cantaloupe and potatoes. Folic acid is in green vegetables, and fortified cereals and breads. The other B vitamins are found in whole grains like brown rice as well as in bananas, beans, eggs, meat, poultry and fish. Good to know: Don't give up on the green stuff or other nutrient-rich fruits and vegetables! Most toddlers have to try a food -- as in, put it in their mouths and spit it out -- an average of eight to 10 times before they start to like it."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Refusing Solid Foods,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-refusing-solid-foods,"Q.My 11-month-old daughter has gone from eating two jars of baby food a day to only one or two spoonfuls. She's still drinking the same amount of formula and  water . I'm worried something could be wrong with her. What should I do? A. Between 6 and 12 months of age, many babies go through a passing stage of refusing solids and favoring milkeither from the breast, or formula. This preference is likely due to the ease and familiarity of sucking from the breast or bottle versus the hard work of swallowing solid food. As long as your baby gets the nutrients she needs during this phase, there's no real cause for concern. Here's how to keep her healthy and encourage her to return to solids: Feed her plenty of milk. Your baby needs about two ounces of formula per pound per day. Most 11-month-olds average around 32 to 36 ounces daily. As long as you feed her this amount during her solid-food strike, she'll get all the vitamins and minerals she needs. Add healthy fat to her diet. During an infant's first year, many of the calories for growth come from fat. Human milk is about 50 percent fat (yet another reason breast milk is best). If your baby's growth seems to be slowing, try increasing her intake of nutritious fats. Flax seed oil is a great supplement for children during temporary dietary downturns. Add two teaspoons to her formula (1/2 teaspoon to four bottles) daily. This provides around 80 extra calories a day. Avocado also contains lots of healthy fats and is a perfect food for babies. Mash up a little ripe avocado and let her eat it off your fingertip. Offer nutrient-dense foods. For  picky solid-food eaters , stick with foods that pack the most nutritional punch in a small volume. Your best bets are avocado, yogurt, tofu, eggs (only after one year of age), veggies (such as carrots and squash)and flax seed oil. Redefine ""baby food."" Perhaps your daughter is trying to tell you that she wants an upgrade in her cuisine! Many mothers say that once they switch from jarred baby food to homemade, their babies begin to eat more solids. Try giving your child the same fresh, healthy foods you eat: Pure fresh fruits, cooked vegetables, lean meatsand seafood (such as wild salmon). By feeding her nutritious homemade foodthe very food you eatyou're shaping her tastes from an early age. Today's childhood obesity epidemic (and subsequent nutrition-related illnesses, such as diabetes) is due in large part to children being raised without a taste preference for healthy foods. Instead, kids favor artificially sweetened and nutritionally deficient packaged foods. If you serve your baby freshly prepared foods as often as possible, she's more likely to grow up preferring those tastes and shunning packaged foods. Try lap-top eating. Sit your daughter on your lap, put her pured food on your own plateand try a bit of it yourself. This strategy capitalizes on an infant's desire to copy what you do. Seeing the food on your plate and watching you eating it should entice her to try it, too. Some babies just want to eat grown-up foods on grown-up plates!"
 Rethinking Juice,http://www.parenting.com/article/rethinking-juice,"Over the past few years, fruit juice has gotten a lousy rap. But while it can be high in sugar and low in fiber, it's not all bad, says Bethany Thayer, a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. Yes, whole fruit is  better  because it typically provides more nutrients, but your family can still enjoy juice and take advantage of its health benefits by choosing the right kinds in moderation: Look for 100 percent fruit juices.  Nutrient-rich picks: Purple grape juice, cranberry juice (both are high in antioxidants), and OJ, which is loaded with vitamin C, potassium, folate, and sometimes added calcium. Limit yourself (and older kids) to 6 ounces a day.  Kids 6 months to 12 years old should have no more than 4 to 6 ounces a day. (Skip it for babies younger than 6 months.) If your child wants more,  dilute it with water to make it go further."
 Unborn Babies Will Eat Your Placenta,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/lauren-parentingcom/unborn-babies-will-eat-your-placenta,"Scientists used to think that the placenta just passively passed  nutrients  from mother to baby. But after studying the habits of mice, they discovered it can actively nourish the fetus, too , according to  Scientific American . In tests, when mice weren't fed for 24 hours in the middle of their pregnancies, they started to see the placenta sacrificing itself by breaking down and recycling proteins in its cells. This allowed the fetus to continue taking in nutrients even though the mother wasn't eating. Soooo... the placenta is amazing!

" Dinner Tonight, Lunch Tomorrow: Broccoli Recipes",http://www.parenting.com/blogs/kid-friendly-recipes/holly-kapherr/dinner-tonight-lunch-tomorrow-broccoli-bites,"Happy National Frozen Foods Month! During the month of March, pay homage to the perennial freshness of frozen foods with recipes that feature veggies that are just as nutritious and yummy frozen as they are fresh. Did you know that frozen vegetables have just about the same amount of nutrients (in some cases more!) than fresh ones? That's because veggies are frozen at their ripest, which is when nutrients are the highest (and no one can deny the convenience factor). After transport and sitting in the produce section, many fresh vegetables start to lose nutrients quickly. According to a study by the Society for Nutrition Education and Behavior, 29% of kids chose broccoli as their favorite veggie, so it's a good bet that these recipes will enter the rotation as favorites. This stuffed chicken-broccoli bake is serious comfort food, but it's the kind of homey recipe that packs tons of iron, lots of protein and only 5 grams of fat. Click here to see the full Stuffed Chicken Broccoli Bake recipe. Use any leftover broccoli you might have for the Ham & Cheese Pockets (with Broccoli).

 New School Lunch Regulations Go Into Effect,http://www.parenting.com/child/nutrition/new-school-lunch-regulations-go-effect,"We all know that getting kids to eat healthy is never easy, but the U.S. Department of Agriculture is trying by putting new rules in place to help children eat healthier school lunches. In 2011, first lady Michelle Obama championed the  Let's Move  initiative, which requires schools that accept assistance from the  National School Lunch Program  to give students lunches that meet nutritional standards set by the  Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 . This year, new rules on what can be sold and advertised as snacks on school grounds went into effect July 1. What do the new rules mean? The regulations center on ""competitive foods,"" which are foods sold in vending machines, a la carte school lunch lines, fundraisers and student stores. Under the USDA's new  ""Smart Snacks in School""  standards, any snack sold on school grounds must meet all USDA requirements. This means snacks must: Be a ""whole grain-rich"" grain product; or Have a fruit, vegetable, dairy product or protein food as the first ingredient; or Contain 10 percent of the Daily Value (DV) of one of the nutrients of public health concern, such as calcium, potassium, vitamin D or dietary fiber. Jill Castle, a pediatric dietitian/nutritionist at  Bundoo , believes parents are tired of trying to teach their children healthy eating habits at home, only to have them disregarded at school. ""Too many nutrient-poor snacks (meaning they have too many calories and few or little nutrients) exist in schools, and these contribute to excess caloric intake and poor nutrient intake,"" Castle says. What are the benefits? The main goal of the ""Smart Snacks in School"" nutrition standards is to give children healthier snack options and limit the junk food they are exposed to school. Castle says snacks are a vital part of a child's diet, and they keep kids' appetites in check to avoid overeating at meals. ""Children require over 40 nutrients each day to sustain their growth and development. These nutrients must be obtained from a wide variety of foods,"" Castle says. ""Healthy snacks help kids get closer to their daily nutrition goals and meet these nutrient requirements, as long as snacks are planned with health in mind."" Fundraisers School fundraisers might also have to change. According to the new requirements, there are limits on the number of exempt fundraisers a school can hold. If the food being sold in a fundraiser meets all the regulatory standards, they can be sold on school campuses during the school day. But if a state agency doesn't establish limits, fundraisers can't take place in schools. Fundraisers can't go on during lunch time when other, healthier food options from the meal service are being served to kids. None of these standards apply, however, if the fundraiser is happening during non-school hours, weekends or off-campus events. Advertisements The promotion of sugary drinks and junk foods during school hours will be phased out to ensure marketing campaigns around children match the USDA's health standards for school meals. Coca-Cola and Pepsi, for example, can no longer advertise their sugary drinks, but they can advertise their companies' healthier products. Any ads on cups, posters, menu boards or scoreboards at school games will eventually have to be taken down or changed. ""This is just another step in taking responsibility for what goes on inside the school walls in terms of nutrition,"" Castle says. ""While school nutrition may not be perfect yet, the effort and intention to offer nutritious food to children is there and evolving."""
" Nutrition Labels, Decoded",http://www.parenting.com/article/nutrition-labels-decoded-1203711328503,"Serving Size Start here, since the rest of the label's info is based on this number.  You might have to do some quick math when it comes to food for kids: If your toddler snacks on only 1/2 cup of cereal and the serving size is 1 cup, adjust accordingly to find out what nutrients he's getting. Also crucial: the ""servings per container"" line. Since many snacks (like a 16-ounce bottle of juice) actually have two servings per container, you'll have to double all the numbers if you end up scarfing down the whole thing.  Calories One of the least important numbers for kids under 5, if they're at a normal weight. ""Little kids are more tuned in to their hunger than we are, so they can usually regulate their own calories,"" says Jeannie Gazzaniga-Moloo, Ph.D., a dietitian in Sacramento, California, and spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association (ADA).  For school-age kids -- and younger, if they're overweight -- you'll want to pay closer attention to how many calories they're taking in.  The ADA's recommended calorie intake: Ages 2-3:  1,000 to 1,400 calories per day  Ages 4-8:  1,200 to 1,800 calories per day (boys need slightly more calories, and so do really active kids)  Ages 9-13:  1,600 to 2,200 calories per day for girls; 1,800 to 2,600 calories per day for boys. Calories From Fat Kids should get 30 to 35 percent of their daily calories from fat,  while adults should shoot for less than 30 percent. An easy way to calculate fat calories: Look for a low ""calories from fat"" number. For example, a 100-calorie snack should have fewer than 30 calories from fat.  Cholesterol Both kids and adults need to take in around 300 mg of cholesterol per day , in part to make the myelin sheath that surrounds the body's nerves. While it's true that too much cholesterol can build up in the arteries and cause heart disease, experts now know that trans and saturated fats play a bigger role in raising blood cholesterol than does the cholesterol in food. The bottom line: Shoot for foods low in cholesterol, but you don't have to avoid it at all costs.  Sodium The daily recommended allowance for kids:  Ages 2-3:  1,000 to 1,500 mg per day Ages 4-8:  1,200 to 1,900 mg per day  Ages 9-13:  1,500 to 2,200 mg per day  Since sodium may raise blood pressure in some people, the  maximum recommended for adults is 2,300 mg  -- about one teaspoon of salt! Of course, we all consume far more than that thanks to the amount of processed foods we eat. (Just one cup of boxed mac and cheese has nearly 600 mg.) And since most restaurant food is typically higher in sodium, it's smart to limit sodium-rich foods at home.  Vitamins  Vitamins and minerals are essential for growing kids, but your child is likely getting most of what she needs as long as she really eats things from every food group.  The nutrients kids most often lack include vitamins A, B6, C, and D and the minerals calcium, iron, and zinc.  See the % Daily Value to find out if a food is a good source of the vitamins and minerals listed on the label. % Daily Value The percentage of nutrients in a food, based on the Food and Drug Administration's recommended daily intake.  The percentages are keyed to a 2,000-calorie diet, though, so a quick way to figure out what your child is getting is to use the percentage as a clue to whether a food is high or low in certain nutrients. A food that's 5 percent or less is considered to be low in that nutrient; if it's between 10 percent and 19 percent, it's a good source; 20 percent or higher means it's an excellent source. Fats We all need some fat to absorb vitamins, help our internal organs work efficiently, and keep us feeling satisfied after meals -- and it's especially important for kids' brain development.  But it's the type of fat to zero in on here.  When you check out a label, look for a low saturated-fat content and little or no trans fat. For both adults and children over 2, fewer than 10 percent of daily calories should come from saturated fat. Shortcut: Try to limit -- or, better, avoid -- packaged foods with a saturated-fat content over 1.5 grams per serving. Carbohydrates Pay attention to total carbohydrates, as well as the amount of dietary fiber and sugars in a food.  For a good idea of the type of fiber and sugar it contains, check the ingredients list. Whole-grain fiber is ideal, and should be high on the list, while sugars (which may be hiding under names that end in ""ose,"" like sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup) should be lower.  Ingredients These are always listed from the greatest to smallest quantity,  so the first three to five ingredients will give you a sense of how healthy a food is. ""In general, you want to look for those that are recognizable, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and steer clear of anything that's hydrogenated, which signifies that it's a trans fat,"" says Gazzaniga- Moloo. What about those ingredients you can't pronounce? If there are lots, it probably means you're getting more preservatives than nutrients.

 Raising a Veggie Baby,http://www.parenting.com/article/raising-a-veggie-baby,"Raising your little one as a vegetarian is a challenge, but it's not impossible. If you take the time to learn your baby's specific  nutritional needs , she can become a very healthy child. ""Infants and toddlers grow at an astounding rate,"" says Ruth A. Lawrence, M.D., professor of pediatrics, obstetrics, and gynecology at the University of Rochester Medical Center. ""To fuel their physical growth and brain development, they use energy (or calories) at three times the rate of adults. And if nothing else, meat and dairy products are concentrated sources of calories and certain nutrients."" A baby who eats little or no animal products is more likely to lack adequate calories, protein, fat, calcium, iron, vitamin D, and vitamin B12, says William Cochran, M.D., associate professor of clinical pediatrics at Pennslyvania State University College of Medicine/Geisinger Medical Center. A deficiency of any of these crucial nutrients can affect everything from proper growth to nerve and brain development. Be sure to inform your pediatrician that your family is vegetarian, so that she too can be vigilant about checking for signs of nutritional deficiency at your child's regular visits. That said, here's a taste of what you need to know to keep Baby healthy and strong. Eating Animal-Free If you're vegan and avoid all animal products (including cow's milk), be aware that any child under age 2 should be consuming breast milk or soy formula that's fortified with iron and vitamin D, cautions Dr. Cochran. Letting Baby play in the sun for 10 or 15 minutes without suncreen a few times a week will also help ensure proper vitamin D levels. Breast milk and formula will also provide a good deal of Baby's calcium. Other good sources for older babies include calcium-fortified soy milk, rice milk, and orange juice. Finding dietary sources of B12, however, may prove more difficult. Some cereals and soy milks are fortified. You can also sprinkle Red Star Vegetarian Support Formula nutritional yeast into Baby's food (it's a little like parmesan cheese). If you're worried that your child isn't getting enough calcium, iron, vitamin B12 or D, talk to your doctor about whether vitamin supplements are necessary. Everything But Meat Families that eschew meat but still eat eggs and dairy products (lacto-ovo-vegetarians) have less to worry about. These foods contain most of the nutrients found in beef and chicken. Just remember that variety is key. Some of the most nutritious foods for all babies include sweet potatoes, bananas, avocados, papaya, cooked carrots, applesauce, and pureed split pea or lentil soup. Lacto-ovo-vegetarians should, of course, offer cheeses and yogurt. ""Ultimately, it doesn't matter if your child is a vegetarian or not, as long as he is getting the nutrients he needs in the right number of calories,"" says Dr. Lawrence. ""The bottom line is that eating is a family affair. The emphasis of meals should be as much on relaxation and sharing as it is on counting nutrients."""
 Top Taste Shapers,http://www.parenting.com/article/top-taste-shapers,"Help your infant and toddler develop a taste for these great ""grow""  foods  -- nutrient-dense fresh or packaged foods that don't contain too many artificial ingredients: Avocados.  One of my favorite first foods, avocados (cut into small pieces or mashed in guacamole) contain healthy monounsaturated fat, perfect for developing brains. Beans.  Different types of beans offer different health benefits, but all of them are a great source of fiber and protein. Blueberries.  One of the very best sources of antioxidants (compounds that fight aging, heart disease, and cancer) out there. Plus, babies love them! (For safety's sake, give your infant only blueberries that are pea-size or smaller.) Flaxseed meal.  Rich in omega-3 fatty acids, which can help boost your baby's brainpower and ward off high cholesterol. Sprinkle it on your baby's cereal, yogurt, or soup (it has a slightly nutty flavor).   Eggs.  An important source of protein. (Give only the egg yolk to infants under 1 year old.) Oatmeal.  Oats are one of the most nutrient-rich types of grains, and oatmeal is a wonderfully filling breakfast or snack. Spinach.  A real ""power"" vegetable, spinach is packed with folate, iron, and calcium. Tofu.  A great non-meat alternative to protein, without all the saturated fat some meats have. Soy (which tofu is made from) is one of the most nutrient-dense foods on the planet -- and takes on the flavor of whatever you pair it with. Tomatoes.  A terrific source of vitamins A and C, plus lycopene, a powerful antioxidant. So ladle on that pasta sauce! Whole grains.  Carbohydrates are an important part of a balanced diet; just make sure the ones your kids eat are made from whole grains and pack a nutritional punch, unlike processed white breads. Yogurt.  Besides yogurt's being an excellent source of calcium and protein, the live healthy bacteria in it is great for kids' digestive tracts. Salmon.  You'd be surprised how many infants love the taste of this fatty-acid-filled fish. Try to buy wild salmon; it contains fewer toxins than the farmed variety."

 Got (Too Much) Milk?,http://www.parenting.com/article/got-too-much-milk-1203714289977,"Q. My 2-year-old is a  milk  junkie. Can he have too much of a good thing? A. Yes.  Milk is a great source of protein and calcium, but for toddlers, 16 to 24 ounces a day -- and no more -- is enough, says Dennis Vickers, M.D., chairman of pediatrics at Sinai Children's Hospital, in Chicago. You might think a few more cups will compensate for picky eating, but drinking too much milk can displace foods rich in other nutrients, such as fruits, grains, and meats. And it may cause constipation and a loss of iron that can lead to anemia. Try replacing one serving of milk at mealtimes with water. Or wait to hand over the milk until he's eaten some of his meal, so he can fill up on food first."
 To Peel -- or Not to Peel?,http://www.parenting.com/article/to-peel----or-not-to-peel,"Kids aren't usually keen on fruit and vegetable skins. Is it okay to pitch the peel? We asked Christine Sergent,  nutrition  team coordinator at Cornell University: Apple Don't peel.  An apple with its peel provides almost twice as much fiber, 50 percent more vitamin A, and 25 percent more potassium as one without it. (Just wash the apple first.) Cucumber Peel.  Most of the cuke's fiber comes from the seeds, and you won't lose too much potassium, either. That hard-to-wash-off waxy coating is there mainly to slow down ripening. Carrot Peel.  The texture of unpeeled carrots can be a turnoff, and peeling won't cost you much potassium, vitamin A, or fiber.   Peach Don't peel.  The flesh and the skin are packed with vitamins A and C, potassium, and fiber. If the fuzz is a deal breaker, try nectarines, which have the same nutrients and fiber."
 Choosing the Right Formula,http://www.parenting.com/article/choosing-the-right-formula,"With more than 25 versions of formula on store shelves, it's hard to know which to choose.  Parenting  contributing editor Claire McCarthy, M.D., explains the varieties. (Talk to your doctor before making a switch from the standard cow's milk formula.) Variety:   Soy  Made from soy protein instead of cow's milk-based protein It's marketed to:  Babies with cow's milk allergies or lactose intolerance, and kids raised strict vegetarian It's actually good for:  Very few babies. True lactose intolerance is almost nonexistent this early (so skip lactose-free formulas, too); plus, most kids with cow's milk allergies are allergic to soy as well. Many doctors now skip soy for hydrolysate (see below). Variety:   Hydrolysate  Cow's milk proteins are broken down to make the formula easier to digest It's marketed to:  Babies with food allergies or lactose intolerance. It's actually good for:  The 2 percent of babies with milk allergies and those with digestive problems. Your doc should suggest a switch only if the problem is severe -- hydrolysate costs almost twice as much as regular formula. Variety:   Organic  Free of pesticides, growth hormones, and antibiotics It's marketed to:  Babies whose parents prefer organics It's actually good for:  Parents who don't mind spending more for peace of mind, though there's little proof that the trace amounts of pesticides, growth hormones, and antibiotics in regular formula are dangerous Variety:   Rice starch  Rice starch is added to thicken the formula It's marketed to:  Babies with severe spitup who need help keeping formula down to get enough calories It's actually good for:  Very few babies. First talk to your doctor about using more formula to less water, or about antacids. If he still advises rice starch, it's cheaper to add rice cereal yourself. Note: Only babies old enough for solids should get rice cereal in formula. Variety:   Preterm  Contains more of the nutrients preemies need It's marketed to:  Preemies, who need more calories and more easy-to-absorb fat It's actually good for:  Most preemies. Your doctor can help you decide if you should switch to regular formula at around 6 months if your baby is growing well; some kids can switch earlier (the sooner the better, since too much can make babies fat). Variety:   Toddler  Has more calcium and other nutrients It's marketed to:  Picky eaters 9 to 24 months old who don't get enough nutrients from food It's actually good for:  Very few kids. Picky eaters may just get worse if they're not encouraged to keep trying solids. With a doctor's supervision, seriously underweight kids over 1 are better off with Pediasure, a meal substitute that offers more nutrients. Variety:   Probiotic  Helpful bacteria are added to strengthen the gut and immune system It's marketed to:  Healthy babies It's actually good for:  Babies who are already suffering from diarrhea (talk to your doctor). Until there's proof that it strengthens the body long term, a permanent switch may not be worth the cost for healthy babies, says the American Academy of Pediatrics."
 Keeping Breast Milk Fresh?,http://www.parenting.com/article/keeping-breast-milk-fresh,"Q.  How long does expressed milk keep? A.  Refrigerated breast  milk , which can be stored in glass, plastic, or stainless steel containers, is best used within 48 hours. Frozen milk keeps for three months if your freezer has a separate door, two weeks if it doesn't. Freeze expressed milk in glass or plastic containers, or in bags designed for freezer storage, and thaw it by running the container under cool, then warm water until it's at room temperature. Keep milk refrigerated until you're ready to use it. If your baby doesn't consume it within 48 hours, throw it out: You should never refreeze breast milk. What about nutrient loss during storage? Though expressed milk loses a few vitamins and minerals, the amounts are so small there's no need to be concerned, says Jay Gordon, M.D., a pediatrician who advises La Leche League, in Santa Monica, CA."

 Kids' Breakfast Cereal Is Over-Fortified With Vitamins,http://www.parenting.com/toddler/feeding-nutrition/kids-breakfast-cereal-over-fortified-vitamins,"Many brands of popular breakfast cerealamong other foodsare overfortified with vitamins and minerals and may be causing harm to children, according to a report from a health advocacy group.  The Environmental Working Group looked at nutrition labels  on nearly 1,600 cereals. Researchers found that 114 of them contained at least 30 percent of the  adult  daily value of vitamin A, zinc and niacin, nutrients that can be harmful in too-large quantities. Twenty-three cereals were fortified with greater amounts of these nutrients than is deemed safe for children under the age of 8. Many of these cereals are familiar brands made by Kellogg's and General Mills. The findings indicate that more than 10 million kids in the United States are  consuming excessive amounts of vitamins . Compounding the problem are outdated labelingthe FDA hasn't updated many of its daily value formulas since 1968and the fact that the recommended amounts and percentages on the labels are calculated for adults. ""We've gained a lot of knowledge in the last 45-plus years,"" says Danelle Fisher, vice chair of pediatrics at Providence Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif. Fisher says the message for parents is not to stop serving cereal to their kids. Rather, it's to practice moderation. After all, these foods are fortified with vitamins, but they are also processed. ""Parents need to be discerning and be conscious of labels; they are there for a reason,"" she says. ""Mix it up. Add eggs, pancakes, fruit and yogurt to your breakfast rotation. Find other go-to snacks. Kids shouldn't necessarily be eating cereal four times per day, plus  taking a daily vitamin supplement . Milk, too, is fortified with vitamin A, so no child should have more than 24 ounces of whole milk per day."" Fisher also wants parents to know that the chances of a child reaching a toxic state from consuming too many of these vitamins is very slim. ""We aren't seeing scores of sick kids,"" she says. Check out these charts to see how much  vitamin A ,  zinc  and  niacin  your child should be getting on a daily basis."
 Pregnant and Nursing Women Get Their Own Snacks,http://www.parenting.com/pregnancy/nutrition/pregnant-and-nursing-women-get-their-own-snacks,"Women often worry about their intake of essential nutrients during pregnancy and when they're  breastfeeding . That's why CredibleCravings created the first  organic snack  bar specifically designed for pregnant and nursing women. The bars provide key nutrition for mom and baby without using artificial flavors or additives. They are made with whole-food ingredients that are gluten- and soy-free and are non-GMO. And 1 billion probiotics are added to each bar. Stephanie Baker, CEO of  CredibleCravings , started the company ""to provide healthy natural products that promote the health of mom and baby."" She says CredibleCravings offers ""an intentional snack developed around the nutritional needs around the prenatal period for women to include on top of their diet already."" Baker believes that what women eat  before, during and after pregnancy  has a significant impact on their health and their babies' health throughout their lifetimes. The bars are designed to be a nutrient-dense snack to satisfy hunger. CredibleCravings bars are not fortified; instead, every ingredient comes from a whole food. ""Every single ingredient down to the dates was put in our bar with a specific purpose in mind,"" Baker says. All ingredients are listed on the bars' packaging and the company's website, not only for transparency's sake, but also because the company also wants to educate women about the importance of good prenatal nutrition. The on-the-go snacks include a variety of ingredients, such as organic kale, organic sprouted quinoa and GanedenBC30 probiotics. The probiotics were included to promote digestive health and are safe to consume with a  supplemental probiotic  during pregnancy. CredibleCravings bars come in three flavors: chocolate, lemon ginger greens and oatmeal cranberry. The ginger in the lemon ginger greens bar may help alleviate nausea and upset stomach, which are common during the  first trimester of pregnancy . The chocolate bar can satisfy sweet tooth cravings without the guilt of indulging. The oatmeal cranberry bar was made to promote energy and regulate digestion."
 Twin Pregnancy Diet,http://www.parenting.com/article/twin-pregnancy-diet,"Most moms-to-be realize that ""eating for two"" doesn't mean they get to eat twice as much, but what's a healthy diet for moms of multiples? Women carrying a single baby are advised to add 300 calories to their daily diet. On top of that, women carrying multiples need another 150 to 300 calories for each additional baby, says Ellie Krieger, R.D., nutritionist and new mom. That translates to 450 to 600 extra calories a day for twins, and 600 to 900 for triplets. But eating 600 calories' worth of marshmallows probably isn't the best way to help your babies grow. ""The key to pregnancy nutrition is that you have to get the most nutrient-dense foods possible, because you need a lot of extra nutrients without a lot of extra calories. This becomes even more important when you're carrying multiples,"" says Krieger. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends getting those extra calories from calcium- and protein-rich snacks. A few great choices (all about 300 calories): a cup of lowfat yogurt and a piece of fresh fruit; two eggs and a piece of whole-grain toast; a cup of cooked black or pinto beans topped with low-fat, pasteurized cheddar cheese; or four fig bars with a glass of skim milk. Although increasing your daily calorie intake with healthy foods should provide the extra vitamins and minerals your babies need to develop, your physician may also prescribe additional prenatal vitamins and iron supplements for multiples. ""The bottom line,"" says Krieger, ""is that you want to gain weight appropriately."" Follow the guidelines on the right from the March of Dimes, track your weight, and increase or decrease your diet accordingly. If you're feeling overly tired or if you're gaining too much or too little weight, talk to your doctor."
 Meat Matters: Protein as a First Food,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/kid-friendly-recipes/elina-bolokhova/protein,"Fruits and veggies might rule as first solids, but don't put off the protein.The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) once recommended holding off on eggs until age 2, but new guidelines suggest introducingmeatand egg yolks starting at 6 months.There are nutrients in eggs and meat that do not occur as much inother foods, says Dr. Keith Ayoob, the director of the Nutrition Clinic at the Children's Evaluation andRehabilitation Center at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine. Beef and other meat is loaded withzinc and iron  which your little one will need if she isn't breastfed or her iron stores begin getting low at six months. Eggsare a great source of choline, an essential nutrient for the functioning of virtually every cell  especiallythose involving the brain and memory development.  The Limit How much should baby have? Dr. Ayood recommends offering some kind of protein at every meal.Babies will usually take what they need and they are going to turn away if theyre full. Theyre veryinternally driven most of the time. Introduce one food at a time by adding it to a food your babyalready likes and tolerates and don't force the spoon! You dont want to force feed a baby becausethen it will turn her off to the whole feeding experience.  Boil 'Em, Mash 'Em Karen Ansel, MS, RD, CDN and author of  The Baby & Toddler Cookbook: Fresh, Homemade Foodsfor a Healthy Start  recommends mixing meat or egg purees with a little bit of baby's favorite fruits orveggies to make them taste great.

 What Eating for Two Really Means,http://www.parenting.com/article/what-eating-two-really-means,"From  BabyCenter.com :  You're pregnant, and the phrase ""eating for two"" seems to promise nine months of delicious abandon...and lots of chocolate. Not so fast. Find out what ""eating for two"" really entails, and how best to  eat for a healthy pregnancy . Can I really eat twice as much now that I'm pregnant? The short answer is: Although you may be sorely tempted to eat twice as much, you have no medical reason to do so. Your body becomes more efficient during pregnancy and is able to absorb more of the nutrients you eat. So consuming twice as much doesn't double your chances of having a healthy baby  instead, it's likely to mean excessive weight gain for you, which can put you at risk for pregnancy complications.  In fact, you need only 300 or so extra calories a day when you're pregnant, fewer during your first trimester. That's about the number of calories found in two and a half cups of low-fat milk or a tuna sandwich. So instead of helping yourself to extra servings at mealtime, think in terms of a smart snack, such as a glass of orange juice and a couple of slices of whole-wheat toast, to boost your calories during your pregnancy.  What foods do I need more of? To meet your additional daily need for protein, calories, and key vitamins and minerals, health experts advise pregnant women to eat a variety of foods. These basics will get you started:   nine or more servings of breads, cereals, and grains (at least four should be whole grain)   seven or more servings of  fruits and vegetables  (at least one rich in  vitamin C  and one in  vitamin A )   at least three servings of  milk and milk products    at least three servings of  protein   lean meat, poultry, fish, eggs, nuts  and  dried beans or peas   T hat sounds like a lot of food, but realize that a ""serving"" tends to be smaller than you might think. For example, one slice of bread equals one serving for the bread and grains category, a half-cup of cottage cheese or one slice of cheese equals a dairy serving, and a protein serving is one egg or a piece of meat about the size of a deck of cards. Choosing several different-colored fruits and vegetables each day will help you get the variety of nutrients you need. Opt for foods as close to their natural state as possible to maximize your chances of eating well: Pick whole-grain bread or brown rice over refined white bread or white rice and fresh fruits over canned fruits in sugar syrup. Eat  fats , oils, and sweets sparingly. (Can't overcome your cravings for junk food?  Discover some healthy  and delicious  alternatives .) Do these food guidelines ever not apply? There are six exceptions to the recommended pregnancy food formula. You should talk to your healthcare practitioner about your particular nutritional needs:   If you're significantly  overweight  you might do better with fewer calories but speak to your healthcare provider to make sure you get the nutrients your baby needs    If you're significantly  underweight  you'll need to eat more   If you're a teenager who's still growing you'll have greater-than-average nutritional requirements  If you're the  expectant mother of multiples , you'll have extra nutritional needs   If you're a diabetic mother-to-be, you'll need to closely monitor your blood sugar levels   If you develop  gestational diabetes  during your pregnancy, you'll also need to closely monitor your blood sugar levels How is the food I eat divided between my needs and my baby's? Doctors don't understand exactly how you and your growing baby divvy up nutrients. Sustenance for your child comes from your diet and the nutrients already stored in your bones and tissues. In the past, a developing fetus was thought of as a ""perfect parasite,"" taking all the nourishment she needed from her mother, regardless of the woman's diet. This myth maintained that if your diet was deficient in, say,  calcium , it didn't matter because your baby could simply siphon the mineral from the reserves in your bones and teeth. Now experts believe that it is the growing baby who is affected most if the woman's diet lacks adequate nutrients.  In a nutshell: Your baby's health and growth is directly related to what you eat before and during your pregnancy. And when you're tempted to overdo it, remember that you're eating for a baby, not another full-sized adult.

 Got Milk? The Benefits of Milk for Kids,http://www.parenting.com/article/got-milk,"When we were growing up, the case for milk was clear: It was good for you, your parents told you to drink it (which you did or, defiantly, didn't), end of story. Since then, researchers have been taking a closer look at the benefits of dairy products, and this has confused the issue of how much kids need, when they need itand what kind they should get. The facts: When do infants need milk? Cow's milk isn't digested well by babies under 12 months, and it lacks essential nutrients supplied by breast milk and formula. So hold off on introducing it until your baby's at least a year old. (The cow's milk in cow's milk-based formula is safe for babies.) Then what? Whole or low-fat? Until your child is 2, whole milk. ""He needs the fat for nerve and brain development,"" says Frank Greer, M.D., chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics's Committee on Nutrition. A possible exception: If your child's gaining weight too quickly for his height, your pediatrician may recommend switching to low-fat milk before age 2. Otherwise, switch to 1- or 2-percent milk at age 2 to move your child closer to a diet with moderate amounts of fat and cholesterol. As long as he doesn't have a weight problem, he can drink 1 or 2 percent indefinitely, rather than switching to skim. Kids need the fat for nerve development for many years. Milk is good for my child's bones, right? Despite common wisdom, recent research looking at the long-term bone-building effects of dairy products has produced mixed results. ""But we do know that three factors determine strong bones: genetics, physical activityand calcium,"" says Dr. Greer. ""And milk is the number one source of calcium."" Milk is also fortified with vitamin D, another important player in bone health, and it has other vital nutrients, including protein, phosphorous, vitamin Aand some B vitamins. Bottom line: Milk is good for bones, but other factors matter, too. How much is enough? Recent U.S. dietary guidelines have raised the number of recommended servings of dairy products from two to three a day for kids between 4 and 8. It's still two servings a day for kids under 4. (For kids 9 to 18, it's four servings.) One cup of milk or yogurt or 1.5 ounces of cheese (equivalent to six dice-size cubes) counts as a serving. But keep in mind that all dairy products are not created equal. Yogurt, for instance, has more protein and sometimes has more calcium than milk, but it's rarely fortified with vitamin D. Can milk keep my child thin? The jury is still out on this, particularly for kids. Some studies have shown that the more dairy foods they consume, the less body fat they put on over time. Yet a recent Harvard study found that young children who drank more than three servings of milk a day gained more weight over a period of one yearwhether they drank whole or low-fat milk. Helaine Rockett, one of the study authors, thinks it's wise to keep milk drinking in perspective. ""Milk is healthy, but it does have calories. If your child is overweight, switch him to water once he meets his servings of dairy for the day."" So you can have too much of a good thing? Yup. In addition to the extra calories, too much milk can fill kids up, increasing the likelihood that they forgo other nutrient-rich foods. So limit your child to the recommended servings per day and make sure he gets a wide variety of nutritious foods. What if my child just doesn't like it? There aren't many foods that offer the same package of nutrients, but there are other sources of calcium. Besides other dairy foods, fortified OJ, fortified tofu, white beansand broccoli, some cereals and cereal bars are fortified with it. Before you give up on milk, though, try offering the flavored kind. The extra sugar is a worthy trade-off for milk's nutrients.

 Sneak in Healthy Food,http://www.parenting.com/article/sneak-in-healthy-food,"My first child, Emily, ate whatever was put in front of her. My second, Samantha, followed suit -- until she turned 2.

 Healthy Snacks Are Key to Young Children's Overall Nutrition,http://www.parenting.com/parenting-advice/tips-tricks/healthy-snacks-are-key-to-young-childrens-overall-nutrition,"Nutrition during the first years of your child's life is critical, not just for growth and development but also for establishing lifelong healthy eating habits and preventing weight-related diseases, such as childhood obesity and diabetes. Focusing on good nutrition, diverse food options and healthy snacks, rather than calories and weight, can help teach kids how to eat healthy and make smart decisions for themselves. ""Instilling good eating habits early can help put a child on the path to a healthy future,"" says Dr. Kathleen Reidy, a registered dietitian and head of Nutrition Science for Meals and Drinks in Nestl's Infant Nutrition department. Reidy is the lead author of  Nestl's Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study  (FITS), which is the largest dietary-intake survey of young children from birth to 4 years old in the United States. ""Nestl realized a huge gap in nutrition information available for this age group, and this study help fills that gap,"" Reidy says. ""It is a valuable resource in the pediatric and health community and referenced by organizations, such as the  FDA  and  AAP ."" The initial study was completed in 2002, and Nestl has continued to collect and analyze data and learn from it. The findings that were published in 2008 have been updated and were presented at the 2014  Experimental Biology  conference on April 28 in San Diego, Calif. The   power   of snacks At a time when  Smart Snacks in Schools  nutrition standards and guidelines are being implemented across the United States, these insights may have implications for helping address childhood obesity even before kids go to school. ""Our findings indicate snacks provide a significant portion25 percentof calories in children 1 to 4 years old,"" Reidy says. The study also found that young children who consume snacks away from homeat daycare, friends' houses or while running errands with Mom or Dadeat an additional 50 calories per day. According to the study , children who eat one or more snacks away from home are more likely to consume sweets, such as cookies, candy and sweetened beverages, and less likely to consume milk. Dairy intake Milk is key in children's diets and a top contributor of many important nutrients, including protein; calcium; vitamins A, D and B12; thiamin; and riboflavin. However, it was found to be one of the top sources of saturated fat in children's diets because they were generally consuming whole or two percent milk. Therefore, the recommendation is not for parents to limit milk, but instead to offer lower-fat options, such as one percent and skim. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breast milk from 0 to 12 months old, whole milk from 1 to 2 years old and low-fat milk after age 2. If heart disease runs in a child's family, the AAP advises switching to low-fat milk at 1 year old. ""Nestl supports the  World Health Organization 's recommendation of  breastfeeding  children for the first six months their lives, then introducing safe and appropriate complementary foods, preferably while continuing to breastfeed, until children turn 2,"" Reidy says. ""Whenever you make the switch to low-fat milk, make sure you add healthy fat. Avocado, fish and products made with olive, canola and safflower oils are all good sources of it. Children do need fat but tend to not get enough healthy fat."" Nutrients   on   the go Kids also have trouble getting enough of the daily recommended amount of nutrients, such as calcium to build strong bones; iron to make hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells; potassium to aid in nerve and muscle function and water balance; and fiber to help with digestion and food intake. ""Nutrition issues during this period can have lifelong effects,"" Reidy says. ""The period of 0 to 4 years old is such a critical time in child development because every organ system in kids' bodies is developing and being shaped and formed rapidly."" Reidy says families can play an important role in this development by  providing nutritious snacks , especially when on the go, by cutting up fresh fruits or precooked veggies to pack in to-go containers. Many food distributors, such as  Gerber , which is part of Nestl, package healthy snacks in convenient pouches or single-serving containers. ""Snacks provide nutrition throughout the day for energy, so think of them as mini-meals rather than treats,"" Reidy says. ""Plan ahead, and talk to your child's other caretakers, such as family members and daycare providers, to make sure you're on the same page."" Fruits and veggies During the second year, it is especially important for parents to provide healthy options when transitioning their kids to table food. According to Reidy, between 9 and 11 months old, kids consume more veggies than at any other time between birth and 4 years old. When baby food drops out of the diet, kids consume much fewer veggies and the quality of the veggies changes. For example, starchy potatoes replace vitamin-rich yellow and green veggies. To help kids get the nutrients they need, Reidy recommends  snacks that contain a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables , low-fat dairy and whole grains and ones that limit saturated fat, sugar and sodium. ""Expose kids to different tastes and textures, and pay attention to the developmental appropriateness of foods. Kids don't always have the motor skills to eat a wide variety of food,"" Reidy says. ""It's important to track your child's growth and check with his or her pediatrician for individualized nutrition plans."" Gerber provides a number of valuable resources on child nutrition on its website,  Gerber.com . It is organized by development stage and has an online meal planner and a 24/7, helpline 1-800-284-9488. Additional findings from the study: A few foods contribute almost 50 percent of daily calories; these include milk, cheese, bread and rolls, ready-to-eat cereals, chicken, turkey and butter or margarine. Preschoolers consume nearly one-third, which is 400 calories, of their total daily calories from solid fats and added sugars. Whole milk, cheese and hot dogs are top contributors of saturated fat and sodium to young children's diets. These foods, as well as bacon, poultry, butter, cakes and cookies, represent 70 percent of saturated fat intake for toddlers and preschoolers. Top foods contributing almost 40 percent of young children's sodium intake include milk, hot dogs, bacon, chicken, turkey, cheese, bread and rolls, crackers and ready-to-eat cereals. This intake equates to a child, 24 to 47 months old, consuming an average of 1,863 milligrams of sodium per day."

 Baby Gear: The Excess List,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/project-pregnancy/lexi-walters-wright/baby-gear-excess-list,"31w5d -  I woke up with couch creases on my cheek and Samoa crumbs stuck to my jaw two twilights ago to some hack booming  MAKE FRESH, ORGANIC, NUTRIENT-RICH BABY FOOD IN AN INSTANT!!  And there went my shut-eye for the rest of the night. I finished watching the infomercial for the  Baby Bullet  (or thought I had, until the poorly scripted baby shower charade they were using to hawk the smiley baby food blender continued to loop,  LOST -like for perhaps another 30 minutes) and took to the Internets. I had recently stripped our baby registry of the  Beaba Babycook  food steamer-masher after friends gave it a lukewarm review and had since been looking for a potential (less pricey) replacement puree-er. Was it possible that this grinning countertop auto-grinder could fit the bill, solving all the potential kid-feeding problems we were clearly destined to have, as recounted by a bunch of actresses (creepily) pretending to hold infants? Erm, no. I've mentioned that I'm a  sucker for marketing ploys : Pop in a couple resonant buzz-phrasesBPA-free! All-in-one!and you've got my attention. But what doesn't fly for me in a baby product, in particular, is its clear demarcation of  being  a baby product, for one. I don't know which Very Clever Marketer thought that slapping a smile insignia on literally every piece of this pastel plastic system was going to sell it better, but that face paired with the word ""bullet"" sure doesn't make me reach for my Visa. Also, to be clear, the Baby Bullet falls into the single-use-cooking-appliance category that The Mister and I try to avoid at any cost, lest our tiny kitchen become overrun with mango pitters and quesadilla makers and margarita blenders. Besides, parenting seems to come with it a bevy of  warranted  short-term-use gearephemeral newborn diapers and infant car seats and rash creams and teething thingssuch that limiting the amount of stuff with short shelf lives, if you will, is warranted if you don't want to be broke and tripping over yet another Baby Blend Date-Dial Storage Cup in a year from now. But! But:  The Baby Bullet only uses the freshest, healthiest ingredients for this 6-second mango and banana puree, with no added sugars or fillersnow THAT'S organic! Uh, so I *can't* use it to make spikey frozen lemonades later this summer? Or grind chickpeas into hummus, or obliterate stale bread heels? Oh, that's what the Baby's big brother, the  Magic Bullet , is for? In that case, we may have found our multi-purpose, all-in-one blender/baby food maker after all! (Just check out the  first FAQ :  Why does everything I chop turn into mush? ) Now I ask you, esteemed parents who've triumphantly slogged through the stuff-overload process: What other baby gear is moot? Which sorts of productsbottle warmers? Baby bathtubs?might a space- and cost-conscious new family skip altogether?"
 Loving Spoonfuls,http://www.parenting.com/article/loving-spoonfuls,"When my older daughter, Olivia, got the all-clear to start solids, we treated it like a big event (because, let's face it, it doesn't take much to thrill new parents). At 4 months old, she was still too wobbly for a high chair, so I held her on my lap, snapped on her crisp new bib, and ceremoniously presented a spoonful of rice cereal while my husband hovered nearby with the camera. Olivia clearly didn't share our excitement over this significant moment. Instead of swallowing, she let the cereal dribble out of her mouth and into that netherworld of infant neck folds. Giving your baby ""real"" food is a parenting rite of passage. When to start, what to serve, and how often -- it seems so complicated after months of no-brainer breast milk or formula. But it doesn't have to be. Christina Frank, a mom of two, writes on health and psychology for many magazines. Mushy Meals (4 to 8 months) Before you even offer that first spoonful, you need to determine whether your baby is actually ready, a milestone that's usually reached between 4 and 6 months. Besides having good head control and being close to sitting on his own, there are three signs that a baby's ready for solid food: ""He'll be easy to distract while nursing or taking a bottle. He'll consistently wake up hungry at night for a few weeks. And he'll become upset that he can't have what you're eating,"" says Will Wilkoff, M.D., a pediatrician in Brunswick, Maine, and author of  Coping With a Picky Eater .  That's what happened with my friend Kristin's otherwise placid 6-month-old, Leo. ""One day he lunged at my chocolate croissant and actually yanked off a piece,"" she says. ""He also eyed everything I put in my mouth."" Although rice cereal probably wasn't what he had in mind, Leo dutifully began with that.  * Getting started.  Mix the cereal (choose one that's fortified with iron, a necessary nutrient at this age) to a very watery consistency with breast milk, formula, or water. Then put a little on the tip of a spoon and slip it into your baby's mouth. Eating from a spoon requires a different set of skills than sucking from a breast or bottle, so don't give up -- it may take several tries before he gets the hang of it.  Continue to offer about a tablespoon of cereal once a day for a few days, thickening the consistency as the days pass. Feed him in the morning or evening, whenever it seems to be the best time for you both.  Don't fret about how much he actually swallows; at this age, infants still get most of their calories from breast milk or formula. ""The value of solids now is to teach your baby a new way to eat and expose him to new tastes and textures,"" says Connie Stuart, a clinical nutrition specialist at Johns Hopkins Children's Center, in Baltimore, and a mom of two.  * Bring on variety.  When you introduce pureed fruits and vegetables depends on your baby's age: If you started giving cereal at 4 months, wait a month or so; if you started at 6 months, add them to your baby's diet after a couple of weeks. Start with one at a time for four straight days before offering a new one. (This way, if there's an allergic reaction, you'll be able to identify the culprit.)  While some experts believe that it's important to begin with green vegetables so that your baby's taste buds aren't ""spoiled"" by the sugary taste of fruits and squashes, others dismiss this as myth, believing that infants are born with a sweet tooth. Most likely, your little one will eat what he wants no matter how deliberate you are. Olivia refused to look at a vegetable (and, at 6, still won't unless we agree to play a complicated game of farmer and cow -- don't ask). After tossing several jars of pricey organic baby-food peas, we were thrilled to see her wolf down applesauce.  * Aim for a routine.  Work toward serving three meals -- roughly breakfast, lunch, and dinner -- with three different food groups at each meal: cereal, vegetable, and fruit (while still nursing and/or bottle-feeding three to six times a day). But how much your baby eats should be up to him. He'll give you clear signs when he's had enough, like sticking out his tongue or turning his head away.  Just don't lose faith if your little one rejects a certain food the first few times. Offer it again a couple of days later. ""It may take as many as twenty tries before a baby begins to like a certain food,"" says Dr. Wilkoff.  Time For Texture   (9 to 12 months) Many baby-food manufacturers market a special line of meals with lumpier textures for the ""advanced"" eater. You can also mash your own foods -- just make sure nothing is bigger than a pea and that the food is able to dissolve in your baby's mouth within seconds. Some good choices: mashed potatoes, overcooked pieces of pasta, bits of banana, grated fruit or cheese, and, of course, Cheerios. Now's also the time to introduce meats -- chicken, turkey, pork, and beef -- either pureed or with a sloppy-Joe-like texture. (Continue to wait four days after introducing a new food before trying another one.) Certain types of fish, such as trout, are okay too; just be hypervigilant about tiny bones. Stay away from fish like swordfish and tilefish, which contain high levels of mercury. * The appeal of finger-friendly foods.  Since they're beginning to master the art of picking up small things at this stage, many babies will want to feed themselves. Brace yourself for big messes, though. Playing with their food is the way infants learn about texture, smell, and taste. And because that's such an essential part of their development, try to keep your sense of humor whenever there's a spill. Easier said than done, of course, when you're trying to chisel three-day-old Cream of Wheat off the toaster oven. Aside from feeding your child in the bathtub (don't laugh -- it's been done), Jeanne Donovan, a mom of three in Leawood, Kansas, suggests putting food directly on the high-chair tray and keeping bowls out of a baby's hands. ""My kids seemed to think that a bowl of food was best for throwing on the floor or using as a hat,"" she says. ""When you spread the food out on the tray, they can't get a critical mass going as easily."" Ellen De Money of Boulder, Colorado, recommends getting a dog. ""Our Lab manages to clean under the high chair, table legs, even between seat cushions!"" [B {* The hazards of biscuits. While many parents like to give their infants things like teething biscuits, bagels, or breadsticks at this age, they're probably better for babies who have demonstrated good biting, chewing, and swallowing skills (which generally means those who are at least 12 months old). If you want to try a bagel or biscuit, make sure your child is sitting up while eating and that you or another adult is watching her -- these can be choking hazards, especially for babies who simply gnaw at them. (True for older babies too.) Saliva softens the bread, which can result in a piece breaking off. Grown-Up Food BLUE_TEXT_BOLD(13 to 18 months) By this age, your baby should, if possible, be eating the same things as the rest of the family (cut up to manageable size) so he learns that mealtime is a sociable event and that certain rules apply -- though don't expect anything resembling table manners just yet. * Balancing solids and liquids.  Solids are now the key source of your baby's nutrition, especially since he's probably drinking cow's milk, which contains a combination of nutrients different from breast milk or formula. Still, he should consume no more than 12 to 16 ounces of milk per day (or 2 cups' worth) so that he actually has an appetite for his meals. And because juice will also fill up a baby and provides almost no nutrition, serve him no more than 4 ounces a day. * When to snack.  While some experts feel that it doesn't matter whether a child grazes all day or just eats three square meals, Dr. Wilkoff warns against ""oversnacking,"" where kids are allowed to munch endlessly and then have no real appetite at mealtimes. ""Snacks should be given at two predictable times during the day -- say, after naptime and before a favorite video,"" he says. Aim for what's nutritious: fruit, string cheese, small cups of yogurt, or crackers. * Adding on utensils.  Your toddler will no doubt want to try to feed himself. Choose a small, soft-edged spoon or a blunt fork, but if he's more interested in using it as a toy, weapon, or launching device than as a feeding tool, take it away and try again in a few weeks. Otherwise, he may be so distracted that he won't eat much. * Why tots turn choosy.  As children become increasingly familiar with various foods and their growth rate slows down, picky eating can begin to rear its ugly head. Witness the parent of a finicky toddler and you may see someone teetering on the brink of insanity. My cousin David would painstakingly insert vegetables into his daughter Diana's penne pasta, only to watch her immediately poke them out. My friend Kristin spoon-fed her older son, Cole, until he was 4. And my husband and I have been literally moved to tears when Olivia has grudgingly agreed to eat a cherry tomato. The upshot? Don't go there, or you may never come back. Your job is to provide well-balanced, regular meals; your child's job is to eat them, or not. Forget tactics like bribery, and, whatever else you do, don't fall into the habit of preparing separate meals for your toddler. The best way to keep your sanity is to remember that kids eat in spurts and slowdowns. They won't starve themselves -- even though there'll be days when you swear your child is eating nothing but air."

Swim laps at a moderate effort for 65 minutes. 4 Food Rules for More Energy In addition to regular exercise, what you eat can make a big difference in helping you get through the day without a nap. Start with these simple rules. 1: Never Leave Home Without Your Water Bottle ""Hydration plays a major role in energy,"" notes Ashley Koff, R.D. That's especially true if you're breastfeeding, since nursing places even more demand on your fluid levels. Dehydration reduces blood volume, so less blood reaches your organs -- including your brain -- leaving you light-headed and dizzy. Drink water or seltzer, or shop the produce aisle. ""Aim for at least 6 'hydration occasions' a day, which can include water-based vegetables,"" says Koff. 2: Don't Forget to Eat With all the hullaballoo that comes with getting your little one fed, changed, and dressed, it's no wonder many moms grab a quick snack instead of a healthy meal. ""Aim to eat a balanced meal or snack every three hours,"" says Koff. That means a mix of healthy carbs, protein and fat -- like whole-grain cereal with milk and chopped nuts, or plain Greek yogurt with berries and almonds -- to keep you satisfied. 3: Don't Use Coffee as a Crutch Sure, you'll score a quick buzz from a double-shot latte, but prepare to bonk shortly thereafter. That's also true for energy drinks and sweets. ""Energy fixes are often energy zappers in disguise,"" says Koff. ""You'll spike, but then you'll be set up for a major crash."" 4: Get the Right Mix of Nutrients For a more natural, long-lasting boost, consume plenty of vitamins and minerals -- especially B vitamins (B6, B12 and folic acid, which help break food down into energy), and vitamin D, which plays a role in blood sugar regulation. Key foods include leafy vegetables, whole grains, eggs, grass-fed beef, shrimp, scallop and sardines."
 Avocados and Folic Acid,http://www.parenting.com/article/avocados-and-folic-acid,"Holy guacamole! If you thought avocados were only good for chip dip, think again. Packed with  folic acid  and heart-healthy fat, consider the avocado a wonder fruit (yes, it's a fruit) for expectant moms and babies alike. Moms-to-be: Avocados contain more folate per ounce than any other fruit, with 45 micrograms per half cup. That's good news because folate (also called folic acid) is a key prenatal nutrient which produces and maintains new cells. Getting enough of it during your first trimester is essential because your baby's central nervous system (including the brain and spinal cord) forms during this time, explains Joseph Hersh, M.D., a pediatrician at the University of Louisville School of Medicine, in Kentucky, and a spokesperson for the American Academy of Pediatrics, and ""folic acid has been shown to lower the risk of birth defects."" As a result, pregnant women and women trying to conceive are advised to take 400 micrograms of folic acid a day. And although your doctor will prescribe a prenatal vitamin that contains the nutrient, it's also a great idea to get as much as you can from food. Bonus: Avocados are the only fruit that contain monounsaturated fat, which helps protect against heart disease, so you can happily say the words ""diet"" and ""fat"" in the same sentence. Babies: Monounsaturated fat is also necessary in the diet of your new bundle of joy. Once your baby is able to eat solid foods, avocados can help provide her with the ""good"" fat she needs for cognitive and visual development. Plus, avocados have more of the energy-boosting potassium your baby needs to grow than bananas. If you're unsure how to incorporate avocado into your family's diet, try one of these easy recipes from the California Avocado Commission: Avocado wrap-up The perfect low-fat snack for pregnant moms 2 teaspoons ripe avocado, mashed 1 fajita-size, fat-free flour tortilla 1 slice of deli turkey, heated until steaming 1 thin slice of low-fat pasteurized cheese 1/2 teaspoon jarred barbecue sauce 1/4 cup carrots, peeled and coarsely shredded Spread mashed avocado on tortilla to within 1 inch of the edge.

 Fun Online Nutrition Game,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/fun-online-nutrition-game,"Lets face it  we could all be a bit more nutrition savvy (I say this as Im munching on a Parmesan crisp cracker, by the way). But while its pretty clear that a cracker made of cheese doesnt exactly qualify as a nutritional super-food, it can often be difficult to assess the quality of what were putting into our bodies, especially for kids.  So check this out: Smash Your Food is a free online computer game where kids are presented with a common food, like pizza, and have to guess the amount of salt, sugar, and oil it contains. They then pull a smash lever that comes down and (you guessed it) smashes the food into a flat, gooey mess. The food drips into three jars that illustrate its actual sugar, salt, and oil content. From there, your kids can see how accurate their guess was. After the results are shown, a chart pops up that illustrates how the nutrient levels in the food compare to the nutritional needs of a child their age, activity level, and gender. So maybe (...hopefully) theyll come to understand that potato chips dont count as a serving of vegetables.  And dont assume this game is just for kids. You should check it out too!

 More Breastfeeding Words of Wisdom from Kim Kardashian,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/sasha-parentingcom/more-breastfeeding-words-wisdom-kim-kardashian,"For a woman whos not nursing-- or even a mom-- Kim Kardashian sure has a lot of opinions about breastfeeding! First Kardashian tweeted about  being disgusted by a woman nursing  in a restaurant without a cover. Now  Usamagazine.com reports  that in the September issue of  Allure , Kardashian says she is planning to breastfeed, but only for 6 months, since they say that after a year, there's no nutrients. I dont care how long she plans to nurse-- totally her choice-- but where is she getting her information about the health benefits of extended nursing? We get ours from  Dr. Sears , who says: The most fascinating studies show that the longer and more frequently a mom nurses her baby, the smarter her child is likely to become. The brain grows more during the first two years of life than any other time, nearly tripling in size from birth to two years of age. It's clearly a crucial time for brain development, and the intellectual advantage breastfed babies enjoy is attributed to the ""smart fats"" unique to mom's breast milk (namely, omega-3 fatty acid, also known as DHA). From head to toe, babies who breastfeed for extended periods of time are healthier overall. Were psyched a celebrity is promoting breastfeeding (here are  some other celebs whove shared their experiences with nursing ), but lets make sure the facts are out there."
 Eating Well on the Road,http://www.parenting.com/article/eating-well-on-the-road,"Between fast-food stops and regular snack and ice cream breaks, it's easy to overdo it on no-good-for-you foods while on vacation. Some ways to help your family keep a healthy balance: Pack sandwiches, snacks, and drinks for a car or plane ride to reduce the number of roadside or airport fast-food stops. Turkey sandwiches, baby carrots, apples, bananas, dried fruit, nuts, whole-grain crackers, string cheese, and bottled juice are nutritious options -- and travel well. Look for a hotel with an in-room kitchen or mini-fridge. Then stock healthy breakfast, lunch, and snack fixings, such as yogurt, lean deli meats, precut veggies, and fresh fruit. To keep energy up, make sure your family always eats a hearty breakfast. If your hotel offers a free continental breakfast, find out what it includes ahead of time. It can mean anything from nutrient-void fare (a powdered fruit drink and packaged danish) to healthier items, such as fruit, bagels, cereal, milk, and juice. Don't fall into the daily burger-and-fries trap. Look for places that serve a variety of foods, like grilled or roasted chicken, pasta, chili, veggie burgers, and pizza. Avoid soda overload: Carry a water bottle for your child, and remind him to drink often to prevent dehydration."
 Meals-in-a-Can: How Healthy Are They?,http://www.parenting.com/article/meals-in-a-can-how-healthy-are-they,"Once marketed almost exclusively to people trying to lose weight and to those too ill to eat solid foods, canned shake-like drinks are now being promoted as nutrient-packed alternatives for folks too time-pressed to prepare a meal. And manufacturers report that more busy  parents  and their kids are opting to sip their suppers. These beverages, known as liquid meal replacements, are fortified with vitamins and minerals and often have a good balance of carbohydrates, protein, and fat. But people shouldn't rely on them more than once or twice a week. Many of the drinks are high in sugar and lack a lot of the beneficial components of whole foods, such as fiber (though some manufacturers add it in) and the anticancer compounds known as phytochemicals. Most of them also provide only about 250 calories-- roughly half the amount found in the average meal. Although postpartum moms who are trying to shed baby pounds might find themselves tempted to try out these shakes, ""they won't help you adopt new eating habits, which is what you have to do to lose weight and keep it off,"" says Sharon Miles, a nutritionist in Torrance, CA. ."

 Closely Spaced Pregnancies Associated with Increased Autism Risk,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/melanie-parentingcom/closely-spaced-pregnancies-associated-increased-autism-risk,"Less than a week after the lead researcher of the debunked 1998 study tying autism to vaccination  has been accused of fraud  comes a study published online today in  Pediatrics  suggesting that a second baby conceived within a year of the birth of a first child may face a three-fold higher risk of autism. Second-borns conceived between 12 and 23 months after a first childs birth had twice the risk of autism compared to babies conceived 3 or more years following an older siblings birth. Researchers at Columbia University studied birth records from 662,730 second-born children from California, who were born between 1992 and 2002 and who didnt have an older sibling with autism. According to data provided by Californias Department of Developmental Services,3,137 second-borns in this group had received a diagnosis of autism by age 6. Because the birth records included information about parental education level, birth weight, and age, researchers were able to account for a number of factors in their calculations, but they still found a link between shorter intervals between births and a higher risk of autism. Although researchers were not able to state definitively that delaying a second pregnancy would lower the risk of autism, the findings may indicate a change in the uterine environment in the years immediately following pregnancy, such as a deficiency in certain nutrients. Closely spaced pregnancies have also been linked to brain diseases like schizophrenia as well as a higher risk of prematurity. Moms, would this latest study lead you to space your pregnancies further apart?"
 Study: C-Sections Tied to Childhood Obesity,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/sasha-parentingcom/study-c-sections-tied-childhood-obesity,"Babies  born via cesarean section have twice the chance of being obese by the age of 3, according to  a new study published in the journal  Archives of Disease in Childhood . The researchers in the study followed more than 1,200 pregnant women in Boston until their children reached the age of 3. By that time, 15.7 percent of children delivered by C-section were classified as obese, while only 7.5 percent of children delivered vaginally were. While the mother being overweight does increase the chance of having a c-section, researchers factored out maternal obesity and high birth weight from the results. Plus: C-section Rate Reaches All-Time High So how could C-sections result in weight problems years later? Researchers say more studies are needed but they have a few theories. The lack of bacteria thats transmitted during a vaginal delivery may affect the absorption of nutrients, leading to obesity later on. Another hypothesis is that hormones and protein signal released during labor may decrease the risk. Others theorize that recovering from a C-section can make breastfeeding, which has been linked with a decrease in obesity, more  challenging. Plus: Spoon-Fed Babies at Risk for Obesity Did you have a C-section? Are you worried about increased risk of obesity for your child?"
 On Call: Sneaking In Veggies,http://www.parenting.com/article/on-call-sneaking-in-veggies,"Q. Our  toddler  hates vegetables. Are juices a good substitute? A.  Don't give up so fast! This is the perfect time to teach your child healthy habits, while he'll still listen to you and before TV and junk-food-loving friends can influence him. Vegetable juices don't pack the fiber or same variety of nutrients that actual veggies do, so they should really be an addition to your child's diet instead of a substitute. To make sure juices are healthy, look for ones with no added salt or sugar, or make your own in a blender or juicer. The best way to get your kid to eat vegetables is to keep offering them (it can take ten or more tries before a child accepts a new food). Top them with cheese, salad dressing, or ketchup, or stir them into soups or sauces -- get creative! Veggie burgers are a fave of my just-turned-2-year-old, and I mix frozen vegetables into almost anything else I'm giving him. Remember, too, that if you eat  your  veggies, your child is more likely to do the same."
 Vitamins for Picky Eaters,http://www.parenting.com/article/vitamins-for-picky-eaters,"Q. My 3-year-old is not a good eaterchicken fingers, a few carbs, and veggies. I think he needs a multivitamin, but what kind is best? First, don't give up on his diet! It can take lots of tries before some kids realize that broccoli, mango, or flounder actually tastes good. Keep putting different foods on his plate. You never know what might happen. That said, most children, including picky eaters, don't need multivitamins if they are getting at least some of all the food groups on a somewhat daily basis, especially meat, vegetables (all colors), dairy, and fruit. If your child isn't, visit your doctor to go over his diet to see if a multivitamin makes sense,and if so, whether to get one with iron. If your pediatrician thinks a vitamin is a good idea but doesn't have a specific brand in mind, you'll have to read labels carefully because nutrient amounts vary between brands. And because most vitamins for kids are designed for ages 4 and up, you'll likely need to split each pill in half for a 3-year-old,not always easy. The good news is that there are all sorts of colors, shapes, and flavors available, designed to tempt the most picky children (though many kids don't like the liquid formulas). In fact, chewable vitamins can be yummy, so you could have another problem,stopping your son from eating more than one. Overdosing can be dangerous; make sure he knows they're not candy, and store them out of reach."
 Is Your Baby Ready for Cow's Milk?,http://www.parenting.com/article/is-your-baby-ready-for-cows-milk,"Get ready for your baby's first milk mustache! Here's how to make the moove to cow's milk: When should we start?  When your baby turns 1. Before that, she needs the specific nutrients that breast milk and formula provide, says Laura Jana, M.D., coauthor of the American Academy of Pediatrics's (AAP) book, Food Fights. Younger babies also may not tolerate the proteins in cow's milk well. Whole or reduced fat?  The AAP now advises that any child with a family history of obesity, cardiovascular disease, or diabetes drink 1% or 2% (but never skim) milk. Babies at risk of becoming overweight (both parents are overweight or the child is in the 85th or higher weight percentile) should also avoid whole milk, says Jatinder Bhatia, M.D., of the AAP's Committee on Nutrition. How should I introduce it?  ""Most babies can go cold turkey,"" says Dr. Jana. If your tot balks, mix cow's milk with formula or breast milk in increasing amounts. (You can continue to heat bottles if your baby prefers.)"
 Are Eggs Healthy For Babies?,http://www.parenting.com/article/are-eggs-healthy-for-babies,"Just in time for spring, here are three common egg myths, unscrambled: Myth: Infants should only eat the yolk.  Egg whites are the most allergenic, which is why, for years, doctors advised only serving infants the yolk. But there's no clear evidence that delaying the introduction of common allergenic foods prevents the development of allergies, serves no purpose that a more recent recommendation from the American Academy of Pediatrics suggests that delaying the introduction of common allergenic foods serves no purpose, even if you have a family history of allergies. What it means: No more separating yolks! Scramble up the whole kit and caboodle whenever your child is ready for solid foods. The exception: If your child has already shown allergic reactions (an allergic rash, for example), talk to your pediatrician about when to introduce eggs. Myth: Babies should only eat a few eggs per week since they are so high in cholesterol.  Infants' actually need more fat and cholesterol than adults for their still-developing brains and organs. So your baby can handle a whole egg every day. Plus, not only does the yolk contain half of the protein in the egg, it carries most of the egg's 13 essential nutrients, including hard-to-get choline, folate, and vitamin D. Myth: Dyed eggs aren't safe for babies.  It's true, dyes can penetrate an egg's porous shell, but in such small amounts that they're perfectly safe. More worrisome is the amount of time the colored eggs spend outside the fridge -- ones left out for more than two hours should be discarded or used for decoration only."
 Why Babies Should Eat Fish,http://www.parenting.com/article/fish-for-babies,"You already know that fish is a healthy food, full of heart-boosting, brain-building omega-3 fatty acids, but here's another good reason to help your tot develop a taste for it: Babies between 6 months and 1 year who eat fish have a 36 percent lower risk of developing asthma later in life, according to a large-scale study of more than 7,000 infants published in the journal  Pediatrics . This six-month window may be a time when a child's immune system is being programmed, and nutrients found in fishomega-3 fatty acids and vitamin Dcould influence this process, says lead study author Jessica C. Kiefte-de Jong, Ph.D., a pediatric epidemiologist in the Netherlands. Fish's soft, chewable texture makes it a great first food, says registered dietitian Karen Ansel, author of  The Baby and Toddler Cookbook  and a member of  Parenting 's advisory board. Opt for boneless and skinless fish, like canned salmon or U.S.-raised tilapia. Start with a puree of fish and a little vegetable broth. As they get older, serve small pieces of broiled fish or fold it into macaroni and cheese or pasta dishes. And be sure to avoid fish high in mercury: swordfish, shark, tilefish, and king mackerel."
" Baby Food Pouches, Yay or Nay?",http://www.parenting.com/blogs/kid-friendly-recipes/katherine-choi/baby-food-pouches,"Baby food used to be as predictable as a jar of strained pears, but these days stores are filled with colorful pouches in foodie flavors like Peach Mango. With companies reporting double-digit sales growth in recent months, pouches seem to be all the ragebut how do they compare with traditional jars? We asked two experts to weigh in. POUCHES ARE A GREAT ON-THE-GO OPTION. The popularity of pouches reflects how busy we are as a society, says Kate Geagan, a registered dietitian in Salt Lake City. I don't think they should  replace  jarsyou don't want to lose the intimate connection of spoon-feeding your baby. But many pouches are minimally processed to preserve nutrients and flavor, and you can just toss one in your bag and not worry that it will break or leak. SUCKING ON A POUCH CAN REALLY BACKFIRE. I have real concerns about this form of feeding, asserts Karen Ansel, a New Yorkbased registered dietitian. Sucking on purees may breed eaters who are reluctant to chew food with more texture (like real fruits and vegetables). Plus, if parents are always offering a pouch at the first sign of hunger, kids may not develop the hunger and satiety cues that will help them learn not to overeat as they get older."
 What's Missing From Your Child's Diet?,http://www.parenting.com/article/whats-missing-from-your-childs-diet,"Creating a  healthy diet  for a child is kind of like working on a jigsaw puzzle every day. If parents can fit all the essential pieces -- fresh fruits, vegetables, whole grains, dairy, and protein-rich foods-- then the healthy puzzle is complete. (Of course, you still have to persuade kids to gobble up the pieces.) Finding that magic assortment of foods seems harder than ever. The puzzle is more complicated and confusing, and there are a multitude of competing pieces-- like fast foods, high-sugar sweets, fat-laden snacks. The result is that these newfangled foods are leaving dietary gaps where the good stuff once was. Ironically, experts say, at the beginning of this high-tech century, our kids may actually be missing out on more nutrients than did children of the previous century. ""Nutritionally, progress is taking us backward. A hundred years ago children generally ate what was fresh and seasonal-- foods were unprocessed and natural,"" says John Monaco, M.D., director of Pediatric Intensive Care at Brandon Hospital in Tampa, FL, and coauthor of  Slim & Fit Kids: Raising Healthy Children in a Fast Food World.  ""We point to our increased life expectancy as a sign that we're doing things better, but that has more to do with modern medicine than modern diets. We could improve our children's health and longevity even more if we fed them whole foods again."" What's a Parent to Do? According to a report by the National Cancer Institute, only 1 percent of children between ages 2 and 19 meet all the USDA Food Guide Pyramid recommendations for grains, vegetables, fruit, meats, and dairy. What's more, 16 percent meet none of the recommendations. It's no wonder then that we hear a steady drumbeat of warnings from health experts about nutrients that are missing-in-action from our kids' diets. So what's a parent to do? First, be aware that in many ways our food supply is distorted, full of new processed choices that kids find irresistible but that have little nutritional value (they don't call it ""junk"" food for nothing!). And be vigilant in limiting these dietary weaklings. Show your children the nutritional high road, but don't panic if they don't always take it. Even the best eaters hit a few bumps and detours now and then. ""Look at the big picture-- how they eat over several weeks, not just a few days,"" says Dr. Monaco. Finally, keep a few numbers in mind-- nutritional scores, if you will, of the amounts of vitamins and minerals that your child needs, plus where to find them. Here's the ledger on some of the most at-risk nutrients: Calcium Food surveys by the USDA show that as much as 60 percent of boys and 70 percent percent of girls between the ages of 6 and 11 fall short of the recommended daily calcium intake. What's worse is that these numbers are likely to increase since milk-- the primary source of calcium for most children-- is steadily losing dietary ground to soda and fruit-flavored beverages. Despite the appeal of milk-mustached celebrities, children haven't ""got milk."" Nor do they have much of other calcium-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, yogurt, and calcium-fortified orange juice and cereals. The importance of calcium for growing bones should not be underestimated. ""A person can only build up the integrity of their bones with good nutrition until about age twenty. After that it's too late,"" says Carol Coughlin, a registered dietitian and author of  Good News About Good Food.  ""That's why we say that osteoporosis is a pediatric disease with geriatric consequences."" For optimal bone growth, and healthy teeth and muscle function, children ages 4 to 8 need 800 mg of calcium daily; ages 9 to 14 need 1,200 mg daily. Best calcium sources: 1 cup cooked collard greens: 357 mg 8 ounces milk: 300 mg 8 ounces calcium-fortified orange juice: 300 mg 1 ounce sesame seeds: 280 mg 1 ounce part-skim mozzarella: 210 mg 1 cup cooked kale: 180 mg Fiber Chronic constipation in children is a problem that pediatricians are treating more and more often. The cause? Diets that are filled with refined, processed foods that lack the natural fiber from fruits, vegetables, and whole grains that is essential for keeping the intestinal tract in good working order. Fiber itself is not a nutrient because it is not absorbed during digestion, but the body definitely needs it for optimal health-- not just for avoiding constipation. Soluble fiber (the kind in beans and oats) can also prevent heart disease because it corrals and eliminates bad fats that would otherwise get absorbed and transformed into blood cholesterol; insoluble fiber (the kind in whole-grain breads and cereals) fights cancer because it shuttles waste, including cancer-causing substances, through the intestines quickly. There's no established children's RDA for fiber, but if kids were to meet the USDA's dietary guideline for eating fruits and vegetables-- about 3 servings of each daily-- they'd be sure to get enough fiber. Best fiber sources: 1/2 cup cooked kidney beans: 6.6 g 1 cup broccoli, cooked: 5.4 g 1 cup cooked oatmeal: 4.0 g 1 cup strawberries: 3.9 g 2 slices whole-wheat bread: 3.4 g 1 apple, unpeeled: 3.6 g 1/2 cup raspberries: 2.6 g Fats It's a four-letter word to most of us, but the truth is that fats, especially certain kinds, are essential to good health. It's unfortunate, perhaps even dangerous, that our culture has developed such a prejudice against fat in foods. ""The low-fat, no-fat movement has really backfired, especially for our children,"" says Dr. Monaco. ""Sure, it eliminates bad fats that can cause heart disease, but it also wipes out the good fats-- such as linolenic fatty acids that are major structural components of brain cells, nervous-system cells, hormones, and immune-system cells. Kids who are constantly growing need even more fat than adults. We simplistically think that fat on our bodies comes from fat in our food, not realizing that it's a very important nutrient."" Good fats -- namely monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fatty acids-- are generally found in liquid vegetable oils like olive, corn, canola, and safflower oil. These fats supply the body with cellular building blocks as well as mechanisms to keep blood cholesterol levels down. Saturated fats-- the ""bad"" ones-- are found in meats, butter, lard, and other solid fats; they tend to raise cholesterol and fat levels in the blood. How much good fat a child needs depends on how many calories he consumes overall. Most health experts recommend that children get about 30 percent of calories from fat. So how does that translate into fat grams per day? The answer lies in a two quick calculations: Total calories x 0.30 (calories from fat) = recommended calories from fat per day Calories from fat divided by 9 (the number of calories per fat gram) = grams of fat in foods For example, if a child eats 1,800 calories: 1,800 x 0.30 = 540 calories from fat; 540 (divided by) 9 = 60 grams of fat-- an amount you can look for on labels. For most preschoolers who burn about 1,200 calories per day, their fat gram quota would be 40; elementary-age kids who use 1,500 calories per day can afford 50 fat grams. That might sound like a lot, but the a typical fast-food lunch of a cheeseburger and small french fries racks up about 28 grams of fat-- and mostly the bad kind. However, a peanut-butter sandwich on whole-wheat bread with an apple and a 1/4 cup of raisins has only 11 grams of good fat (plus plenty of other healthy stuff like fiber, complex carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals). When considering fat, remember balance is best. Zinc If there were an annual MVP award for nutrients, zinc would be the winner. It's now recognized as one of the most active minerals in the body, by virtue of its presence in a multitude of enzymes. Without zinc our bodies could not digest protein, turn food into energy, or fight infections. Zinc deficiency in children leads to poor growth, anemia, and an impaired ability to heal. The best sources of this nutrient are meat, fish, and poultry products. However, if your child is a vegetarian, plant sources of zinc include whole-grain cereals, beans, seeds, and nuts. The RDA for zinc for children 3 to 10 years of age is 10 mg; for 11- to 18-year-olds the RDA jumps to 15 mg because teenagers especially need zinc for healthy sexual development. Best zinc sources: 4 ounces flank steak: 5 mg 4 ounces dark-meat chicken: 3 mg 1 cup fortified oat flakes cereal: 1.5 mg 2 slices whole-wheat bread: 1.2 mg 2 tablespoons sunflower seeds: 1 mg 1/2 cup cooked lentils: 1 mg 3 ounces white-meat turkey: 1 mg"
 Pregnancy Diet: Eating (Well) for Two,http://www.parenting.com/article/pregnancy-diet,"Eating right during your pregnancy prepares you for the rigors of labor, delivery, and, ultimately, motherhood, while also helping your baby develop during nine months of enormous change. ""Even with all the diagnostic tests and fancy equipment now available, good nutrition is still the most important factor in giving your baby a healthy start in life,"" says Bridget Swinney, M.S., R.D., author of  Eating Expectantly: A Practical and Tasty Guide to Prenatal Nutrition . You're ahead of the game if you started eating well from the beginning of your pregnancy, but don't worry if you didn't mainline vegetables right after conception. What's important is that you focus on creating healthy eating habits as soon as you can. Food for Tot   Experts advise that you see a nutritionist during your pregnancy if you are significantly over- or underweight, a teenager, pregnant with multiples, or nursing while pregnant, because you may have special nutritional needs that can best be met by following a custom diet. ""Strict vegetarians should also consult with a dietitian,"" says Brenda Danner, R.D., C.D., outpatient dietitian at St. Francis Hospital and Health Center in Indianapolis, IN. ""Those who don't eat eggs or milk may lack vitamin B12 -- which is found only in animal products -- as well as iron, calcium, and other nutrients."" For the majority of women, however, professional advice isn't necessary -- you just need to rethink your usual eating habits. Start by changing your definition of a meal. ""If you're used to a glass of juice as a morning meal,"" says Glade B. Curtis, M.D., a board certified ob-gyn who practices in Salt Lake City, UT, and author of  Your Pregnancy Week by Week , ""make an effort to eat a real breakfast every day."" According to Dr. Curtis, a balanced diet of four or five small meals throughout the day is the best way to nourish your baby and maintain a high level of energy. (It will also help counter morning sickness; see next page.) It might sound like a lot of food, but you need the extra calories: The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends pregnant women take in an additional 300 calories each day. But that doesn't mean chowing down on every high-calorie, high-fat treat in sight. To get the best results, go easy on fats, oils, and sweets, and stick to lean, low-fat, nutrition-packed foods. If you're unsure of just what to eat every day, here's a guideline: 9 slices of bread or 9 ounces of grains (a major source of thiamin, iron, niacin, and zinc) 4 cups of raw or 2 cups of cooked vegetables (provides vitamins A and C, folic acid) 3 medium pieces of fruit (provides vitamins A and C, folic acid) 3 to 4 8-ounce cups of milk or other dairy products (for protein, calcium, riboflavin, B12 and D) 2 3-ounce servings of lean meat (for protein, iron, thiamin, B6 and B12, folic acid, and zinc). Read ahead for pregnancy weight concerns Weighty Issues   In addition to providing nutrients and energy, all those calories will help you gain weight during pregnancy. The recommended gain for an average-size woman is 25 to 35 pounds. (Experts advise overweight women to stay in the lower end of the range, and underweight moms-to-be should aim for the higher end.) While consciously putting on pounds is an unappetizing thought for many women, this is one time when you should cut yourself a break. ""It's not a time to be concerned about the weight,"" says Los Angeles-based Kathy Kaehler, fitness consultant for  DietSmart . com  and a mother of three. ""Focus on the fact that you are giving yourself and your baby quality nutrition, and let the weight do what it will."" Undereating or sticking to a weight-control diet while you are pregnant is not a wise choice. ""When you don't eat, your baby may not have the energy and nutrients it needs and will use up your own nutrient stores,"" says Swinney. But by the same token, don't feel like you can gain as much weight as you want; it won't just melt off after childbirth. ""Cut out the empty calories,"" says Danner. If you overdo it, she says, ""you're going to feel extra stress to shed those pounds later."" To accurately monitor your weight during pregnancy: Weigh yourself weekly, not daily (no need to worry about small fluctuations); Weigh yourself at the same time of day and under the same conditions (i.e., every Saturday morning, after using the bathroom, wearing the same nightgown); Use the same scale each time for accuracy. Tummy Trouble   Nausea and morning sickness are likely to strike during the first three months of your pregnancy. ""Eating small meals five to six times a day can help,"" says Danner, since an empty stomach often triggers nausea, as can eating too much at one sitting. ""Drink fluids between meals, not with meals, to avoid extra movement in the stomach."" If morning is your queasiest time, ""eat a little something to jump-start the digestive process before you get out of bed,"" she adds. ""Keep crackers or pretzels by the bed. They help settle the stomach because they are low in fat and easy to digest."" If your prenatal vitamin is making nausea worse, ""try taking it with meals or at night as opposed to first thing in the morning,"" says Dr. Curtis. If you really have trouble tolerating the supplement, he suggests talking to your doctor about alternatives -- like chewable prenatal vitamins -- but don't give up on getting these essential nutrients into your system. If you are vomiting often, ""eat whatever you can to get through it, and try to stay hydrated,"" says Swinney. ""Don't feel guilty that you're not eating a power-packed meal"" while you're sick, assures Dr. Curtis. Some foods that are usually well-tolerated during serious bouts of morning sickness include turkey or chicken breast, raw fruits, raw vegetables, juices, caffeine-free soda, skim milk, popsicles, Jell-O, Kool-Aid, pudding, yogurt, cereal, rice, and pasta. If you experience heartburn in the last trimester of pregnancy, drink plenty of fluids, keep active, and focus on consuming fiber-rich foods. Read ahead for what not to eat during pregnancy To Eat or Not to Eat   Pregnant women should definitely steer clear of raw fish (it could contain harmful bacteria) and alcohol (which could lead to fetal alcohol syndrome). You should also avoid soft or mold-ripened cheeses (like Brie and Stilton) because of the risk of listeria, and raw eggs, which might contain salmonella. Talk to your doctor about caffeine, which a recent study has linked to an increased risk of miscarriage. As for concerns about the danger of pesticides, Danner recommends giving fresh produce a good 20- to 30-second wash with warm water to remove dirt, germs, and any trace amounts of pesticide residue. If you're really worried, you can always go organic, but most experts say that produce from your local grocery store is just fine. ""In my opinion, we have one of the safest food supplies in the world,"" she says. ""I would hate for moms-to-be to completely avoid fresh fruits and vegetables.""

 Ask Dr. Sears: Is Vitamin Water Safe for Kids?,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-is-vitamin-water-safe-for-kids,"Q. My 2-year-old daughter recently asked to try my vitamin  water  (she liked it and said it ""tasted like Jell-O!""). While I never give her soda or foods with artificial sweeteners, I don't see much harm in letting her have some of this vitamin-enriched water. Are there any pediatric concerns regarding these drinks?  A.  The bottom line: Don't waste your money on vitamin water. You're better off serving your child plain bottled water and letting her get vitamins from healthy foods and/or a daily multivitamin. Here's why:  Vitamins in the water may not be as nutritious as the vitamins in food.  My main concern is that, biochemically, the vitamins in the water may behave differently in the body than vitamins that naturally occur in foods from nature, such as apples or broccoli. Due to a biochemical quirk called synergy, when a food's vitamins and minerals are packaged together, they help one another absorb into the bloodstream more efficiently and function better throughout the body. When, for example, vitamins C and E are eaten together in a food, such as a green leafy vegetable like spinach, the health effect on the body is much greater than when the vitamins are consumed individually as, say, vitamin C in vitamin water. In short, food gives you the whole package of nutrients. Vitamin water gives just a few vitamins and may not be nearly as effective the same ones eaten in foods. Let water be water.  One of the most important nutritional principles in childhood health is to shape young tastes. You don't want your child to grow up thinking that drinks should ""taste like Jell-O"" -- in other words that every drink must be colored, flavored, or sweetened. Rather, you want her to develop a taste for plain water. Start now to instill in her the belief that water is a healthy -- and preferable -- drink. Vitamin water may not be as healthy as you think.  While I don't know which brand of water you drink, I can assume that if it tastes like Jell-O to your child, it's artificially colored and/or sweetened, both of which could be harmful to your child's health. In my opinion, artificial food colorings (such as red #40) have never been proven safe for growing children. In fact, the government categorizes them as GRAS (generally regarded as safe). This translates to: ""We're really not sure!"" Try to restrict not only artificially sweetened beverages but those sweetened with sugar or high fructose corn syrup as well. Researchers believe these beverages are the top cause of childhood obesity in America. In addition, studies have shown that gulping down sweetened beverages can depress the body's immune system, just the opposite of what you hope to achieve from consuming vitamins.  I'm also concerned that vitamin water may harm the teeth. Medical journals have recently published warnings about acidic beverages eroding dental enamel. Vitamin C (chemically known as asorbic acid), which is generally one of the vitamins added to vitamin water, is acidic, while plain water is not. Another safety concern is the ""drug interactions"" that could potentially occur among the ingredients in these so-called smart beverages. The combination of all these herbs and vitamins have, most likely, never been studied in children. We know that nature safely combines nutrients in fruits and vegetables, but we don't know the safety of combinations put together in a laboratory and then added to a bottle of water. Many nutritionists believe that vitamin water is simply a gimmick, and I tend to agree."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Dieting Questions,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-dieting-questions,"Q   Is it okay to diet while breastfeeding? Can I at least reduce carbs? A:   When you breastfeed, those extra pounds melt away without drastic dieting. You may be happy to know that compared to formula-feeding mothers, breastfeeding moms show more fat loss by one month postpartum and tend to loose more weight from three to six months postpartum. Even though breastfeeding mothers consume more calories, the energy used in making milk uses up some extra fat stores. In fact, to produce enough milk for your baby you use up an extra 500 calories a day. If these weight-loss benefits of breastfeeding are not enough, it  is  safe to diet, as long as you make sure you and your baby receive proper nourishment. You should not lose more than a pound a week. Here are some ways to lose weight safely:  Exercise a lot.  In my experience with postpartum weight loss, dieting without exercise rarely keeps the weight off and may deprive you and your new baby of needed nutrients. Crash diets and fad diets often lead to water and muscle loss instead of fat loss, while exercise burns fat and increases your basal metabolic rate (BMR). To burn an extra 300 calories a day, put your baby in a carrier and take a brisk walk for at least an hour every day. Put on some music and dance while you hold your baby in your arms or in a sling, or if you prefer the atmosphere of a gym or a day spa, reserve this as a special outing just for you. With postpartum exercise you can enjoy a couple of extra perks: Exercise produces the body's natural ""feel-good hormones"" called endorphins, which lessen the severity of postpartum depression, and exercise also elevates production of the milk-making hormone, prolactin.  Eat the right food rather than less food.  Go through your present diet and figure out how you can whittle away 200 calories a day of junk food. This would be the equivalent of two chocolate-chip cookies. Eat nutrient-dense foods such as fresh fruits, whole grain cereals, wild rice, non-fat yogurt, non-fat cottage cheese, white-meat chicken or turkey (without skin), salmon, tuna, sweet potatoes, all vegetables, and legumes. Avoid calorie-dense foods like high-fat, high-sugar, packaged foods. I advise all postpartum mothers: Don't go down the aisle in the supermarket that sells package goods (which should be called ""packaged bads"") like chips, cookies, and snack foods high in junk carbs and unhealthy fats. And stay away from anything with the word ""hydrogenated"" on the label.  Fill up with fiber.  Fiber is calorie-free and filling, and, as an added perk, fiber prevents constipation, which is common during postpartum recovery. Fiber-rich foods are also high in complex carbohydrates, which don't give you the roller coaster effect of blood sugar swings. Foods high in fiber are: whole grain cereals, flaxmeal, apples, prunes, lentils, kidney beans, pears, chickpeas, bran, and sweet potatoes.  Eat a right-fat diet rather than a low-fat diet.  Little growing brains need fat. Since your baby gets fat from your breast milk, the last thing you want to do during breastfeeding is not eat enough fat. The best fats for making nourishing milk and losing weight are the omega-3's found in fatty fish (such as salmon and tuna), flax oil, and canola oil. Avoid as much animal fat as possible and certainly avoid any fats that are listed as ""hydrogenated"" on the label.  Eat a right-carbohydrate diet rather than a low-carbohydrate diet.  At least 50 percent of your daily diet should be in the form of complex carbohydrates -- whole grains, fruits, and vegetables -- which are the best sources of energy. Reduce your intake of fiberless carbohydrates, those found in frostings, sodas, and junk juices (juice drinks full of corn syrup). The above tips will not only help you loose a lot of unwanted fat, they will also help you feel good in the process."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Homemade Baby Food Causing Gas?,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-homemade-baby-food-causing-gas,"Q. We make all of our baby's food from scratch, but he seems to have a lot of gas. Could this gassiness be caused by the homemade  baby food , and if so, are there certain foods we should avoid to alleviate the problem? A.  I applaud you for making your own baby food. It's a lot better for your baby than anything you could buy, and it's most likely not the cause of his gassiness. Aside from the nutritional benefits, how you feed your baby now is going to shape his tastes later on. Remember this principle, and you'll give your child a real health advantage for the rest of her life. Let's go over this important concept first, and then I'll give you a list of suggestions for making mealtimes more intestine-friendly. Feeding your baby homemade solids accustoms his taste buds and gut to fresh, wholesome food, while also programming your child's tastes to the healthy adult foods typical of your family's cuisine. Similarly, if your baby grows up on canned or jarred foods, his body will learn that this is what food is supposed to taste like, and so, later on, he will be more likely to choose processed items over fresh. Years ago, I had a group of moms in my pediatric practice that I dubbed the ""pure moms."" They never let a single morsel of packaged food enter the mouths of their kids. Monitoring these children as they got older, I noticed that they were not only much healthier than average, but also that they tended to not overdose on junk food and, in fact, many of them would actively shun junk and packaged foods. Because their developing tastes and intestines had been programmed to the tastes of real foods, they had made the connection: ""I eat good, and I feel good."" So, please do keep making your own baby food, and follow the tips below to help ease your baby's gassy belly. Feed twice as often, half as much.  Smaller, more frequent feedings is one of the best remedies for gassy babies, and here's why: It's not the food itself that causes gas, but the quantity of food at one feeding. Remember, your baby's tummy is only about the size of his fist. If babies take in more than that amount, the undigested food ferments in the lower intestines, producing gas. Serve the least allergenic foods.  Begin your baby on the solid foods that are least likely to cause an allergic reaction, such as avocados, carrots, squash, pears, applesauce, apricots, broccoli, rice, sweet potatoes, and papayas. Foods that are more likely to be allergenic are: berries, citrus fruits, corn, cow's milk, egg whites, nuts, peanut butter, soy, tomatoes, wheat, and yeast. Make every calorie count.  Nutrient-dense foods that pack a lot of nutrition in a small volume will be much friendlier to tiny tummies. Once you've determined (by trial and error) that your child is not allergic to any of the following foods, you should make them a major part of his diet. The most nutrient-dense foods recommended for toddlers are: avocados, eggs, cheese, seafood (preferably wild salmon), kidney beans, yogurt, peanut butter, sweet potatoes, tofu, and whole grains. Avoid constipation.  A common, but often hidden cause of gassiness is chronic constipation. The longer food waste stays in the intestines, the more likely it is to ferment and produce gas. So, give your child lots of fluids to keep his digestive tract moving smoothly. Aim for about one ounce per pound of body weight per day. Also, encourage your child to nibble or graze on food throughout the day (again, small amounts rather than big meals); this eating pattern should help prevent blockages."
 The Poop On...,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-poop-on,"It may be tough to admit, but once you have a baby you become more interested in poop than you ever would have imagined. Typically, infants who are breast-fed will have mustard-yellow, very  soft  stools. Formula-fed babies, and those who are eating solids, have darker, firmer stools. But variations in appearance are bound to show up, and most are completely normal. Here's a guide: Green Stool   ""This isn't something to worry about,"" says Judith Sondheimer, M.D., of the Children's Hospital, in Denver. Certain foods, such as soy-based formulas, can cause green stool, as will antibiotics. Multicolored Stool or Food Particles   Strained carrots and squash can produce orange stool. And while it's not uncommon for toddlers to pass whole raisins or pieces of corn, this doesn't mean a child's body feels discomfort or isn't absorbing nutrients. Sandy-Looking Stool   Most common in babies who are eating solids, such stool is often due to high-fiber foods, like oats and fruit. A sandy, sticky consistency could also indicate mild constipation; if so, your pediatrician can advise you on how to ease the problem by making changes in the baby's diet. ""Seeded"" Stool   In toddlers, seeds from foods such as tomatoes, raspberries, and watermelon will pass painlessly out of the body whole. While the above variations are harmless, if you notice the following, save the stool in the diaper and call your pediatrician immediately: Putty-colored or chalk-white stool, which can indicate liver trouble. Blood in the stool, a possible sign of infection or internal bleeding. Large amounts of mucus in the stool, which may be due to inflammation or infection. Black stool, sometimes caused by upper-gastrointestinal bleeding. An unusually high number of watery bowel movements in one day, which may be the result of infection and could lead to dehydration. No bowel movement for three consecutive days, or tiny, hard stool, which may indicate constipation."
 When Your Child Can't Digest Bread,http://www.parenting.com/article/when-your-child-cant-digest-bread,"Some kids can't digest wheat, barley, rye, and other grains-- born with a genetic  condition  called celiac sprue, they're unable to break down the gluten protein in such grains. Now, research reveals that much of what was once widely believed about this condition is wrong: It's rare.  Far from it: As many as 1 in 100 has it. That's about 30 times more common than has been previously thought. Babies outgrow it.  Not true, though many doctors are only just recognizing this as a myth. Often, it first appears when babies start on cereals. Classic symptoms-- cramping, gas, and diarrhea-- may subside, but if the disease goes untreated, it can be very harmful. It only causes an allergic reaction.  Because a child with celiac sprue can't absorb nutrients properly, her growth may suffer, puberty can be delayed, and neurological problems can surface. (If undiagnosed until adulthood, it can lead to anemia, even infertility.) It's incurable.  True, but it's quite treatable. A gluten-free diet makes symptoms disappear, usually within a few weeks, and often allows the body to repair itself. It's hard to eat that way.  Yes, it's tough to skip regular pasta, pizza, and bread, but gluten-free alternatives are available in health-food stores and supermarkets and on the Internet-- and rice is fine. If your child is smaller than average or is losing weight even though she's eating normally, talk to your pediatrician about testing her for celiac sprue. New diagnostic tools make pinpointing it easier than ever. If the test is positive, you should be checked too-- celiac sprue runs in the family and can be silent for decades."
 Mealtime Mayhem,http://www.parenting.com/article/mealtime-mayhem-21333663,"Disclaimer: When feeding your 9- to 12-month-old, don't expect to stay clean, and don't assume that what worked once will work twice. If you get any nutrients in your mealtime misfit at all, consider yourself lucky. Remember that everything for your baby at this age is about  learning , so if half of mealtime involves smearing and poking, look on the bright side: At least you're still feeding your child's mind (if not his belly). Also, be aware that even the largest baby has a pretty small stomach. It can't hold a great deal, so your little one probably won't eat very much in one sitting. A better plan of action is to offer meals and snacks at regular times throughout the day.  Common feeding challenges -- solved! Offense:  Intentionally drops food on the floor. Motive:  He wants to see what will happen, or he may be done eating. What to do:  End mealtime; give him another object to drop. Offense:  Doesn't use utensils properly. Motive:  He doesn't yet have fine motor skills to use a fork and spoon well. What to do:  Help him out; this is how he'll learn to use utensils correctly.  Offense:  Only eats one type of food. Motive:  This could be about control. What to do:  Don't force feed; provide his favorite food with a little of something else. Offense:  Barely eats anything. Motive:  It could be about control, but he could also just be a light eater. What to do:  Avoid battles, offer a variety of foods, and stay in close touch with the doctor."

 Rx for the Stomach Flu (and Hangovers!),http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/sasha-parentingcom/rx-stomach-flu-and-hangovers,"Has your family gotten the  nasty stomach bug  thats going around? I've just discovered this awesome new tummy soothing, feel-better beverage called B.R.A.T. No, they didn't name it after your kid; the name comes from the classic ""BRAT"" diet recommended by pediatricians for decades to calm all sorts of digestive discomfort. BRAT is an acronym for bananas, rice, applesauce, toast. This tasty organic drink contains all those nutrients, except for the toast because the seriously smart parents who invented it wanted it to be okay for kids with allergies, too. It's got all the good stuff upset tummies needhydrating electrolytes, vitamin D, calciumand none of the bad: no added sugar, no dairy, soy, corn, casein or gluten. And it's a creamy, soothing, milk-like blend that comes in vanilla, chocolate honey, and cinnamon toast, as well as the original flavor. I taste-tested all four and every one is absolutely yummy, especially chilled, and natural tasting. A 32-oz. container costs about the same as traditional electrolyte solutions. It's also available in grocery stores nationwide (go to  BratDietDrink.com  for specific locations) and on  Amazon . com . An unopened container can stay at the ready on your pantry shelf for a year. It's also great for morning sickness, lactose intolerance, celiac disease, chemotherapy treatment, or um, hangovers (it IS pretty close to New Years Eve, after all). Now that's a drink box a mom can love!"
 Taking Care Of Preemie Teeth,http://www.parenting.com/article/taking-care-of-preemie-teeth,"When the teeth of babies who are born prematurely come in, they may lack protective  enamel  and be more prone to decay and staining. The more premature the infant, the more likely she is to have this condition, which is known as enamel hypoplasia. Teeth are fully formed under the gums at birth, and the enamel on one or more teeth can become damaged when lifesaving respirator tubes press against gums for prolonged periods. In 40 to 70 percent of cases, the hypoplasia is due to illnesses, or insufficient calcium from feeding problems or difficulty absorbing nutrients. Parents can head off a variety of enamel decay-related problems-- such as cavities and damage to adult teeth that are forming below the gums-- by taking their infant to the dentist within six months of her first tooth eruption, and no later than age 1, according to the American Academy of Pediatric Dentistry. Although this recommendation applies to all kids, ""for children born prematurely, it can be particularly important,"" says Carrie Havelka, D.D.S., a pediatric dentist at Boston's Children's Hospital and the mother of 3-year-old twins who were born preterm. For kids who are especially cavity-prone, a dentist can ""paint"" a white plastic material over affected baby teeth to help protect them from further decay and to fill in any cosmetic imperfections. Just as important as dental visits is a bedtime routine of cleaning your baby's teeth and gums with an age-appropriate toothbrush and a small amount of toothpaste. ""This helps remove decay-causing material,"" says Dr. Havelka, ""and also gets the child used to having something in her mouth, readying her for brushing her teeth on her own later on."""
 How to Quell Morning Sickness,http://www.parenting.com/article/how-to-quell-morning-sickness,"If you're always feeling  ill , perhaps this will be comforting: Morning sickness may actually be beneficial. Nausea and vomiting may help protect both mother and fetus from food containing harmful chemicals and organisms, according to a study from Cornell University. In fact, researchers found that nearly 65,000 women who suffered from morning sickness had fewer miscarriages as well as a greater chance of giving birth to healthy babies. If that alone doesn't make you feel better, some proven ways to help: Stay out of the kitchen.  The hormone surges of early pregnancy often cause women to have extra-sensitive noses. Let someone else cook, or order takeout. Eat often.  An empty stomach will only make you feel worse. And if you crave it, eat it, say experts, even if that means a grilled cheese sandwich for every meal. (Don't worry about getting a balanced diet, but do take prenatal vitamins, which will compensate for any nutrients you lose during this stage.) Go alternative.  The American Medical Association has approved acupuncture (often covered by insurance) as a means of treating pregnancy nausea. Another option: Bio-Bands, acupressure bracelets often used to ease motion sickness (available at most drugstores). Both methods can provide short-term relief. Drink up.  It's important to consume ten cups of fluids a day. If that's difficult, try alternating water or juice with watermelon cubes (they yield about half a cup of liquid per cup consumed), ice pops, or ice chips. If you can't keep down any liquid, even water, and you begin to lose weight, call your doctor right away. This may be a sign of hyperemesis gravidarum, severe nausea and vomiting that affect about two percent of pregnant women and can lead to dehydration and malnutrition."
" Oh, Sugar!",http://www.parenting.com/article/oh-sugar,"Most  kids  get more than their fair share of sweets, so it's not surprising that a recent study by the U.S. Department of Agriculture found that, on average, preschoolers eat 15 teaspoons of added sweeteners (such as sugar, honey, or fructose) a day -- that's 9 teaspoons more than they should. The main sources of these sweeteners in their diets: soda, fruit drinks, cookies, and candy, says Joanne Guthrie, Ph.D., lead author of the study. Nutritionists warn that too much sugar can lead to cavities and obesity, and possibly increase the risk of heart disease. Plus, sweets usually contain few vitamins or minerals -- and may diminish a child's appetite for more nutritious foods. Some ways to cut back on them: SHOP SMART  Added sweeteners come in a variety of forms -- sugar, sucrose, corn syrup, honey, maltose, dextrose, and fructose. If any of these is one of the top three ingredients on a food label, pass up the item or serve it sparingly. OPT FOR FRUIT JUICE  Fruit and sports drinks often pack in more added sugars and have fewer nutrients than 100-percent juices. Save soda as a special treat, and encourage your kids to drink milk or water with their meals. DON'T BE FOOLED BY LOW-FAT FOODS  Some contain more sugar to fill in for the fat. While you may still want to offer fat-reduced cookies, cakes, and granola bars, alternate them with healthier snacks like fruit, pretzels, and string cheese. Artificial sweeteners, such as saccharin or aspartame, also aren't necessarily a better bet. Although low in calories, they're usually found in nutritionally empty desserts and can help foster a sweet tooth. SWEETEN TREATS YOURSELF  Rather than buying a fruit yogurt, add a mashed banana and a teaspoon of table sugar to plain yogurt; instead of cookies or breakfast bars, toast a slice of whole-wheat bread and top it with a little honey or jam, or a pat of butter and cinnamon and sugar."
 Recipe: Healthy Chicken Pasta,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/project-pregnancy/ashley-fraxedas/recipe-healthy-chicken-pasta,"21w1d-  Eating when youre pregnant feels more like a part-time job. Ive always been a conscientious eater, but now that Im pregnant, Im obscenely concerned about making sure I get all the necessary nutrients. And now that I have some of my energy back, Im trying to get back in the kitchen cooking. I came across a few recipes that are good for pregnant women. They were decent but didnt really do it for me. So heres my modified version of an alfredo chicken pasta recipe that is extremely healthful and delicious (read: no heavy whipping cream). Hope you like it as much as my husband and I do! Ingredients: - spinach fettuccine - 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts - 1 cup low-sodium chicken broth -  cup fat-free milk - a handful of cherry tomatoes - a few handfuls of fresh spinach -  cup of your favorite mushrooms - 2 tbs. chopped red onion - 5 or so leaves fresh basil - at least a  cup of parmesan cheese (depending on your taste) Instructions: Grill chicken with just salt, pepper and basil. Let rest under foil for at least 5 minutes and then cut into strips. Set aside. Heat saut pan with olive oil. Once hot, cook cherry tomatoes until they burst. (Cooked this way, the tomatoes have an extremely buttery taste.) Add red onion and saut until golden in color. Add the mushrooms and saut for about 3-5 minutes. Add fresh basil, salt and pepper, chicken broth and milk. Bring to a low boil then immediately dial back to a simmer. Let the flavors develop and the sauce reduce to about half, approximately 10-15 minutes. In the meantime, boil water and cook spinach fettuccine. When pasta is about half done, add the spinach, chicken and parmesan cheese to the sauce. Let the spinach cook and the chicken soak up the flavors for a few minutes until the pasta is cooked. When cooked, add pasta to sauce and let sit for about 5 minutes. Cook and enjoy! You have a creamy, delicious pasta packed with calcium, antioxidants, vitamins, protein, iron and everything you and your baby need!"
 Feeding a Preemie,http://www.parenting.com/article/feeding-a-preemie,"If you've given birth prematurely, your breast milk is ideal for your baby's needs; it's rich in antibodies and certain nutrients. But not all preemies can breastfeed successfully, and some need extra protein, iron, calcium, and vitamins A, D, and E to help them grow and gain weight. Most preemies need about 120 calories a day for each 1,000 grams they weigh. To get that amount, they may need human milk fortifier added to their diet or a special preterm or transitional formula, depending on their health and gestational age, says James Lemons, M.D., director of neonatology at Indiana University School of Medicine.   At 32 weeks or younger, infants aren't yet strong enough to breastfeed, so they'll need to receive all their nutrition intravenously or through tube feeding. Moms should begin to pump and freeze their breast milk as soon as their baby's born so their milk supply doesn't dry up.   At 32 to 34 weeks, babies have a limited ability to suck and swallow. Almost all of their nutrition will still come from an IV or a preemie formula with a preemie-size nipple.   At 34 to 36 weeks, most infants can be weaned from the IV and should have a good handle on sucking, swallowing, and breathing. They can't breastfeed exclusively yet but should nurse every four hours or so and be given fortified formula.   At 36 to 40 weeks, preemies usually have a good sucking rhythm and most likely will breastfeed every three to four hours. But they'll still need additional formula.   At 40 weeks and up, babies should be able to breastfeed exclusively if they have no complications, such as breathing difficulties or heart irregularities. Your baby's ready if he's gaining three and a half to seven ounces a week, wants to nurse at least every three hours, and soils at least eight diapers a day."
 Quick Meals Made Better,http://www.parenting.com/article/quick-meals-made-better,"Feel a twinge of guilt when you prepare dinner out of a can or in the microwave?

 Safest Sleep Positions During Pregnancy,http://www.parenting.com/article/safest-sleep-positions-during-pregnancy,"When you're pregnant,  getting comfortable at night  is no easy feat. After all, your back is aching, your legs are cramping, and your belly is threatening to take over the bed. On top of all that, you can add yet another nighttime inconvenience: figuring out which position is the safest for sleeping. For obvious reasons, sleeping on your stomach isn't a good idea after the fifth month of pregnancy. And it's so uncomfortable that most women stop doing it much earlier, says Vera Stucky, M.D., an obstetrician at the University of California, San Diego Medical Center. But sleeping flat on your back isn't the answer, either: Experts generally advise women to avoid this position after about the 16th week. ""If you sleep on your back, the enlarged uterus presses against the inferior vena cava, the vein that returns blood from the lower body to the heart,"" Stucky explains. This can cause low blood pressure, exacerbate existing kidney conditions and hypertension, and contribute to the development of hemorrhoids, varicose veins, and edema. In rare cases, sleeping on your back can even prevent the baby from getting all of the oxygen and nutrients it needs. Usually, however, the symptoms of low blood pressurenausea, shortness of breath, dizziness, and clamminesswill rouse a snoozing mom-to-be long before her fetus is endangered. And nature itself may provide a second line of defense. ""If the baby gets uncomfortable, it will start kicking and wake up the mother so she can change position,"" says George Verrilli, M.D., an obstetrician in private practice in Rhinebeck, NY. So how should you get those precious zzz's? The safest bet is to lie on your sidepreferably your left side, which allows for maximum blood flowthe next time sleep beckons. And if you wake up in the ""wrong"" position, simply roll over and dream of the day when that maneuver won't be a major undertaking."
 On Call: The Poop on Poop,http://www.parenting.com/article/on-call-the-poop-on-poop,"Q.   My baby's  bowel movements  vary widely in color and consistency. What's normal? A.  How about we start with what's not normal? *  Blood in stool  (Note: Blood can look black and tarry as well as red) *  Hard, small stools  accompanied by pain, which can mean constipation *  Watery or mucus-y stools  more than eight times a day -- either one could signal infection *  Pale or chalk-colored stools  (while rare, this can be a sign of a liver problem) *  Stools that consistently look oily or greasy , which can indicate a problem with nutrient absorption If you see any of these signs, or if your baby has a change in her bowel movements that's accompanied by fever, vomiting, or what seems to be pain (especially a tummy ache), you should check in with your pediatrician. Pretty much anything else you see in her diaper, though, is fine. Once the greenish-black meconium has passed through a newborn's intestine -- this usually takes a few days -- baby poop  will  vary widely in color and consistency, depending on what you've been feeding your child. Exclusively breastfed babies, for example, tend to have mustard-colored, sometimes greenish, seedy stools, though the exact color can change with the mother's diet. In general, breastfed babies have looser bowel movements than formula-fed babies -- who usually have browner, more formed stools -- because breast milk is digested more quickly and easily than formula. But there can be individual differences, too. Once babies get started on solids and juice, their bowel movements become even more formed (and foul smelling), and will sometimes take on the color of whatever they've been eating or drinking. Case in point: I recently saw a baby who had bright-pink poops in his diaper from fruit punch!"
 A Versatile and Healthy Recipe: Fruit & Veggie Popsicles,http://www.parenting.com/recipes/snacks/versatile-and-healthy-recipe-fruit-veggie-popsicles,"Friends, I have found the holy grail of easy, delicious and sneaky recipes to get fruits and veggies in my preschooler. I have used these frozen treats to soothe my teething toddler, numb his sore throat and keep him cool on a hot day. All of this while giving him the nutrients and vitamins that fruits and vegetables deliver. This recipe is super simple and versatile. You can get creative and name the concoctions fun things. My son loves his green ""Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle Power Pop."" The  Base  Recipe Purchase popsicle molds at the dollar store or simply dig out a muffin tin. Place chopped fruit in the molds. Add the liquid base: juice, yogurt, pureed veggies or a combination. Freeze them. To pull your popsicles out of the molds, run a little hot water over them until they slide out with a little tug. You may need to use a butter knife to cut along the outer edge of each treat if you use a muffin tin as your mold. Citrus Refresher Peel and chop kiwis. Place the cut-up  kiwi  in the molds and pour orange juice over them. Bang the molds on the counter a few times to get rid of any air bubbles, then place them in the freezer. Turtle Power Pop If you are a  green smoothie  person, you'll love this one. Throw in a few handfuls of spinach or kale with a liquid of your choice in your blender. We love almond milk, but you can use water, coconut milk or orange juice. Blend for a few minutes so that your spinach isn't leafy or chunky. Add a banana and about a half-cup strawberries. Blend it until it is smooth, pour it into your molds and freeze. Berry Dreamsicle Place your favorite berries in your molds. Blueberries, blackberries and raspberries can be used whole, but  strawberries  should be cut into pieces to fit into the molds. Spoon plain or vanilla  yogurt  on top of the berries. Bang the mold on the counter to help the yogurt settle in the nooks and crannies around the berries. If the yogurt is room temperature, it will be runnier, and less banging will be required.

 Mom Drinks Her Own Breast Milk to Survive in the Wild,http://www.parenting.com/news-break/mom-drinks-her-own-breast-milk-to-survive-wild,"The Short of It New Zealand mom Susan O'Brien had some runners' gel packs, an energy bar and two liters of water with her when she got lost while running a 20-kilometer race in Rimutaka Forest Park. But, she credits drinking her own breast milk with giving her necessary nutrients during the overnight ordeal. The Lowdown ""I got lost and got stuck in some bushes, and then I thought that was it,""  Susan told reporters . ""I wanted to carry on, but I got too exhausted, so I just dug a hole. I didn't have a life blanket. I thought I was going to die."" It was cold, and Susan, who's a breastfeeding mom, wanted to regain her energy, so she expressed some of her milk to drink while she was stranded. She dug a hole to sleep in and placed dirt on top of herself to keep warm. The next day, Susan was found and returned happily to her family. The Upshot So, can drinking your own breast milk really help in a survival situation? Yes, but only in the short term, Mary Jane Minkin, OB-GYN and clinical professor at the Yale School of Medicine,  tells Women's Health . The calories in the breast milk can definitely keep your energy levels up, and of course, it's a totally safe  drink to consume  (and it's clean, as long as you find the right container!). But eventually, you'd get dehydrated since your body needs fluids from other sources; without them, you'd stop making milk. ""She's very creative. I'm glad she thought of this,"" Minkin said.

 Finding a Formula,http://www.parenting.com/article/finding-a-formula,"Q. My sister gave up breastfeeding after only a few weeks, and she had to switch formulas several times to find one that agreed with her baby. One of my vegetarian friends feeds her infant soy formula, while my neighbor's baby drinks a special hypoallergenic preparation. I've also noticed lactose-free formula on the supermarket shelf--the choices are overwhelming! How can I figure out which kind is right for my baby? A.  Although the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that mothers breastfeed their babies for at least 12 months, many women choose not to breastfeed at all, encounter problems with it, or quit early for personal reasons. In these situations, infant formula is the only appropriate substitute for breast milk during the first year of a child's life. Since commercial formula first became available more than 70 years ago, it has continually undergone modifications and improvements so that it provides the calories and nutrients a baby needs in as close an approximation to breast milk as possible. Formula preparations do differ, however: While the Food and Drug Administration regulates nutrient content, each manufacturer adds its own ingredients and uses its own processing methods. While I can't endorse a specific brand, I can give you an overview of the different types of formula that are available so that you -- together with your baby's doctor-- can choose one that's best for your child. The Basics No matter which type of formula you select, make sure it is labelled ""with iron"" or ""iron-fortified."" The AAP recommends that all infant formulas contain extra iron. Iron deficiency, which can cause anemia and impair mental and motor development, is markedly reduced in formula-fed infants who drink iron-fortified formula. Unfortunately, anecdotal reports that supplemental iron causes digestive problems such as constipation, spitting up, or colic lead some parents to choose low-iron formulas. However, research studies fail to show that iron-fortified formulas are directly related to these conditions. Ordinarily, standard cow's milk formula, with its long history of safe use and extensive testing, is the first choice if breastfeeding is eschewed or halted early. Since regular, whole cow's milk is not recommended for babies under a year of age (it contains little iron, is relatively high in protein and minerals and low in essential fatty acids, and can even cause intestinal blood loss), basic infant formula is derived from cow's milk that has been modified to make it more similar to breast milk and more agreeable to an infant's digestive system. But because some babies do not tolerate regular cow's milk formula, various alternatives have been developed. Unfortunately, many parents do not understand the indications for using these alternative formulas, and switches are often made without a clear rationale. Before deciding to change your infant's formula, speak with your baby's doctor, who can help you make a suitable selection that will be well tolerated by your child. The Alternatives One type of cow's milk formula with a special modification is lactose-free formula. It was created to feed babies who suffer from lactose sensitivity or a deficiency of lactase, the digestive enzyme needed to break down the milk sugar lactose, a component of standard formula. Such babies can become fussy, gassy, or experience diarrhea when drinking regular cow's milk formula. Lactose-free formula simply replaces lactose with a more tolerable carbohydrate. Soy formula, which uses soy protein in place of cow's milk protein (and is also lactose-free), has been available for several decades. It is very popular, and doctors recommend it for a variety of symptoms. Most commonly it is suggested for infants whose fussiness, gas, loose stools, spitting up, or vomiting is believed to be caused by an allergy to cow's milk protein. A soy formula may also be prescribed for infants who have eczema due to a food allergy, trouble digesting lactose, or are recovering from a bout of diarrhea, since the condition can temporarily deplete the lactase enzyme. Some vegetarian parents, like your friend, may prefer to feed their infant a soy formula. Although many breastfeeding mothers choose a soy formula to supplement their infants because they believe it to be healthier, the AAP acknowledges no advantage of soy over cow's milk formula in this instance. Many infants with symptoms of cow's milk allergy also react adversely to soy. These babies may do best on a hypoallergenic (or protein hydrolysate) formula that has been developed for infants with severe food allergies, problems digesting protein, or colic due to suspected cow's milk protein sensitivity. Since the protein in these formulas is broken down extensively (or predigested) so that it does not provoke an allergic response, hypoallergenic formulas are also recommended for babies at high risk for developing allergies due to a strong family history of them. Most hypoallergenic formulas are also lactose-free and contain fats that have been broken down to facilitate their digestion by babies with fat malabsorption. These specialized formulas can be incredibly helpful for certain babies, but they are more expensive than others and are sometimes not very tasty. Follow-up and ""toddler"" formulas are marketed for older babies. These formulas contain extra protein, calcium, and iron for children who may not receive adequate amounts from the food they eat. However, if your child eats a well-rounded diet and drinks regular formula through age 1, this type of formula is probably not necessary. Special Circumstances Other formulas have been developed for infants with conditions that require extra care. For example, one manufacturer makes a cow's milk formula that is pre-thickened with rice starch to reduce regurgitation in infants who spit up more frequently than others. Another makes a soy formula with added soy fiber, which is believed to shorten the duration of diarrhea in toddlers and infants over 6 months. Thankfully, formula manufacturers also make highly specialized formulas for the small number of infants and toddlers born with inherited metabolic disorders that require highly unusual feeding regimens, such as phenylketonuria (PKU). Special formulas are also available for feeding very small, hospitalized premature infants under a doctor's care. Often they are used to supplement breast milk, giving a tiny preemie that extra boost of nutrients needed to promote speedy growth and development. Premature infant formulas generally contain additional calories, protein, vitamins, minerals (like calcium), and easily digestible fats and carbohydrates. Preterm discharge formulas are now available to provide a higher level of nutrients to improve the growth of very premature infants after they leave the hospital. I hope this primer will help you sort through the maze of formula options you've encountered. Once you and your doctor have made a choice, through, don't forget that feedings aren't just about nutrition. They are also an ideal time for intimate social interaction between you and your infant. You can encourage this closeness by holding your baby close to you in a semi-upright position, making eye contact, and speaking softly to him while he eats. Just because you're not breastfeeding doesn't mean you can't share a special bond with your baby during this time."
 Nighttime Nursing,http://www.parenting.com/article/nighttime-nursing,"Your friend's 3-month-old, who's on  formula , now sleeps for six-hour stretches, but your own breastfed baby still wakes up hungry every two to three hours. What's going on? ""It's natural for infants who nurse to want to eat more frequently,"" says Lawrence Gartner, M.D., chair of the executive committee section on breastfeeding for the American Academy of Pediatrics. Your own milk is relatively low in fat and protein, so it's digested more easily than formula. That means it passes through your infant's stomach a little faster -- so she feels hungry sooner. A breastfed baby may also ingest a little less at each feeding than a formula-fed baby. Every time you nurse, your milk changes from a thin liquid to a thicker, slightly higher-fat substance. Your infant may feel satisfied -- and stop suckling -- shortly after that more-filling milk starts to flow. (Not to worry: She's most likely getting plenty to eat.) Frequent night nursings can be pretty rough on you, but they're actually a good thing, especially in the first six months. They provide your baby with the nutrients she needs to stay healthy, help keep your milk supply from dwindling, and prevent your breasts from becoming engorged. In fact, if you try to make a ravenous baby wait to eat, she'll probably just get fussier and may not be able to settle down for a good meal. You  can  try to make sure she goes back to sleep quickly: Don't turn on the lights, don't play with her, and forgo a diaper change unless she's soaked or uncomfortable. By the time she's 8 or 9 months old, she'll start to give up most of those wee-hour feedings."
 Solids: The Right Time to Start?,http://www.parenting.com/article/solids-the-right-time-to-start-21354774,"It's best to introduce  solid foods  when your baby's between 4 and 6 months, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. In some cases, it's okay to begin a little later (some babies may not be developmentally ready until 7 months), but starting sooner is definitely not a good idea. Here's why: It'll backfire.  Babies are born with a reflex that makes them push their tongue forward when something touches it -- which means they can't use the tongue to move food from the front to the back of the mouth. If you try to push the food into your baby's mouth, he may start to gag, which certainly isn't going to make his first experience with solids a pleasant one. Between 4 and 6 months, this reflex disappears. He may develop a food allergy.  ""The gut is much more permeable before four months, so whole proteins can be absorbed easily, which increases the risk of developing an allergy,"" says William Dietz, M.D., director of the division of nutrition and physical activity at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta. He doesn't need it.  Up until about 6 months, breastmilk or formula provides all the nutrition he requires. After that, he'll start to need certain nutrients from solid foods. He also should get additional calories -- how many varies from baby to baby. On average, by the time he's 1, he may take in about 400 extra calories from solids; 600 by age 2. He could acquire long-term health problems.  In one study, infants fed cereal before 3 months old had a higher risk of developing celiac disease (a serious intolerance of wheat protein) than those who were fed cereal between 4 and 6 months. Studies also suggest that babies given cereal before 3 months (and, possibly, after 7 months for the first time (are at greater risk for diabetes)."
 Tips for Mixing Formula,http://www.parenting.com/article/mixing-formula,"Reports linking the deaths of two infants from a bacterial infection to the formula they drank last winter were heartbreaking. Fortunately for bottle-feeders, the formula was found to be safe. Two other babies were also sickened but recovered, and none of the cases have been found to be relatedall four occurred in different states. Neither the powder nor the water used to mix it was found to be contaminated, so it's unknown how this bacteria, called  Cronobacter sakazakii , got into the bottle, explains Steven Abrams, M.D., a professor of pediatrics at Baylor College of Medicine, in Houston, and a member of the AAP's Committee on Nutrition. We do know, however, that babies, especially those under a month of age and those born prematurely, are very susceptible to certain germs, so the proper preparation of formula is critical. The bottom line? Whether you buy the powder, concentrate, or ready-to-drink kind, formula is safe. But since the powder is most affordable, many parents go that route. How to mix it right: 1. SQUEAKY CLEAN It goes without saying: Wash your hands well with soap and water before each feeding. Consider sterilizing new bottles and nipples by boiling them the first time you use them; after that, washing in a dishwasher will do. 2. ONE AT A TIME  It's tempting to prep a day's worth of bottles or to save leftovers for later. But to be on the safe side, nix both ideas. Mix only the serving your baby's about to drink and use it right away. Toss any leftovers and start with a fresh bottle the next time (bacteria from your baby's mouth can contaminate the leftover formula). 3. WATER WORKS  Only mix powder with plain tap or bottled water that's been boiled for a minute, then cooled down. (Contrary to popular belief, bottled water can contain bacteria.) Boiling the water first sterilizes it and removes anything harmful. 4. THE FINE PRINT  Follow the directions on the formula container carefully. The powder and water must be measured exactly so your baby gets the nutrients he needs. Compare Baby Formula"
 What to Eat to Conceive,http://www.parenting.com/article/what-eat-conceive,"Youre already loading up on organic fruits and veggies, staying away from processed foods and making sure you get enough whole grains, lean protein and dairy into your diet, as well as taking a prenatal vitamin for insurance. But can eating certain foods during different phases of your cycle enhance your fertility? Some experts say yes! Different phases of the cycle require a womans body to produce different hormones and go through separate processes, says Jill Blakeway, M.S., L.A.c., clinic director at  The YinOva Center  in New York and co-author of  Making Babies: A Proven 3-Month Program for Maximum Fertility . So if a woman wants to maximize her chances of conceiving, it is possible to eat foods that are advantageous to each phase. But since many pre-conception eating recommendations are nothing more than wild Internet rumors, we asked the experts to weigh in on what to eat during each of the four reproductive phases. Want the scoop? Read on. Menstruation When your period starts to flow, you may feel crampy, bloated, fatigued and moody. You may also be depleting your iron stores. In fact, the average woman loses 30-40 milliliters of blood over the course of three to seven days. Iron is attached to the red blood cells, so the way you lose it is by bleeding, says Elizabeth Ward, M.S., R.D., a Boston-area nutrition consultant and author of  Expect the Best: Your Guide to Healthy Eating Before, During and After Pregnancy  (Wiley 2009). Menstruation is a good time to remember to focus on foods rich in iron, which the  Dietary Guidelines for Americans, 2010  names as a nutrient of real concern among women in their childbearing years. Just dont view your period as an excuse to load up on double cheeseburgers. Its understandable for women who have a failed cycle to indulgejust dont linger in that place, says Hillary M. Wright, MEd, RD, LDN, director of nutrition counseling for the  Domar Center for Mind/Body Health  at Boston IVF and author of  The PCOS Diet Plan: A Natural Approach to Health for Women with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome . Have an episode, then try to regroup and get back to setting the stage for a successful pregnancy. Fuel up on: Meat, beans, fish, leafy green vegetables and seeds. Most of these foods are rich in iron, protein or both, which is especially important if you have endometriosis or bleed heavily. And some (like fish, seeds and leafy greens) have anti-inflammatory properties, which can help mitigate cramps by encouraging healthy blood flow. Another tip: eat plenty of bell peppers, tomatoes, broccoli, kiwi, citrus and other food sources that are high in vitamin C. Vitamin C helps the body absorb iron from beans, whole grains and fortified cereals, says Ward. Steer clear of: Cold foods (if your periods are clotted and painful) and alcohol, caffeine and spicy foods, which can make bleeding even heavier. On your plate: Steak fajitas with black beans, bell peppers, onions and tomato salsa. Follicular Phase During the follicular phase, your body is working hard to develop a dominant follicle and estrogen levels are on the rise. Unfortunately, women who are struggling with fibroids and endometriosis often have too much estrogen (a condition called estrogen dominance). Cruciferous veggies like broccoli, kale, cabbage and cauliflower contain a phytonutrient called di-indolylmethane (DIM), which can help women metabolize estrogen better, says Blakeway. In fact, DIM binds to environmental estrogens like pesticides and hormones in meat and dairy products, helping rid the body of excess estrogen. Just dont forget to have some olive oil, avocado, nuts and seeds with those leafy greens. These foods are loaded with vitamin E, which is found in the fluid of the follicle thats housing your egg. Fuel up on: Foods that support follicle development like nuts, seeds, green vegetables, legumes, eggs and fish. Steer clear of: Alcoholit affects hormonal balance. Its also dehydrating and the loss of water in the body may make cervical mucus too thick, says Blakeway. On your plate: Chicken and broccoli stir fry with cashews and brown rice. Ovulation As you near ovulation, the body needs plenty of B vitamins and other nutrients to support the release of the egg and promote implantation. Zinc can help with cell division and progesterone production and vitamin C is found in high quantities in the follicle after the egg is released and may play a role in progesterone production as well, says Blakeway. Essential fatty acids (EFAs) are also crucial during this phase. The best source: omega-3s from fish and fish oil supplements. These EFAs are best known for promoting blood flow to the uterus and supporting the opening of the follicle to release the egg, but guess what? They also open up the tiny blood vessels in your nether regions, which can ensure youre primed and ready for action. Fish oil thins out your blood and increases circulation to your body parts, says Wright. Plus, fish oil boosts the testosterone in your bodyyes, women have this hormone tooso you may become aroused more quickly. And who among us couldnt use a little of that when entering the O-zone? Fuel up on: leafy greens, whole grains, eggs, legumes, meat, fish (or fish oil supplements) and waterlots and lots of water. Water plays a key role in transporting hormone and developing follicles. It also helps thin out cervical mucus, which may make it a little easier for your partners swimmers to get to their goal. Steer clear of: Acidic foods like coffee, alcohol, meat and processed foods, which may make your cervical mucus hostile to sperm. Baby carrots are often touted for maximizing your bodys baby making juices because theyre alkaline (the opposite of acidic). But according to Blakeway, any alkaline foods will do, particularly green vegetables, sprouts and wheatgrass. On your plate: Cajun salmon and brown rice with a side of spinach sauted in garlic and olive oiland a bowl of strawberries and a dark chocolate truffle for dessert. Chocolate is an aphrodisiac because it can mimic feelings of falling in love, says Ward. Luteal Phase Now is the time to load up on nutrients that encourage cell growth. Beta-carotene, which is commonly found in leafy greens as well as yellow and orange foods (e.g., carrots, cantaloupe and sweet potatoes), helps keep your hormones in check and prevents early miscarriage. In fact, the corpus luteum, which helps produce the progesterone necessary to sustain a pregnancy, is loaded with the powerful nutrient. One food that gets a lot of attention during this phase is pineapple. In addition to beta-carotene, pineapple contains a substance called bromelain, which has been shown to mildly support implantation through its anti-inflammatory properties. Theres not a lot of research out there for the benefits of eating pineapple during the time of conception, but if you want to hedge your bets, you may benefit, says Wright. After all, pineapple is a healthy food with no downside. Experts discourage taking bromelain as a supplement though because the dose may be too high, and anything that dramatically moves blood during this time could be counter-productive. Fuel up on: Warming foods like soups and stews. The luteal phase is all about creating higher temperatures to help hold a pregnancy. Steer clear of: Cold or raw foods, especially ice cream and frozen yogurt. The luteal phase is a time when you want to promote growth and expansion; cold constricts. On your plate:  A hot and spicy bowl of chili made with lean ground beef and a slice of crusty bread. For dessert: pineapple sorbet. Think you may be pregnant alrea dy?

 9 Food Myths,http://www.parenting.com/article/9-food-myths,"It's tough to know if your kids are  eating  right, especially when everyone serves up different advice. Is jarred baby food healthier than homemade? Will sweetening vegetables prevent your toddler from ever eating them plain? To separate the truth from the hype, we asked top nutrition experts for the lowdown on the most common food myths. Myth:  If your bottle-fed baby is constipated, you should switch to a low-iron formula. Fact:  The amount of iron in formula doesn't affect an infant's bowel functions. In fact, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics, giving low-iron formulas to a baby could lead to anemia, a deficiency in red blood cells that can result in learning delays down the road. Although breast milk contains little iron (the reason low-iron formulas were originally introduced decades ago), the small quantities that are in it can be easily absorbed by an infant's digestive tract. The iron in formula, however, is not as readily absorbed, so more must be added to ensure that babies get enough, says M. Edward Keenan, M.D., an assistant professor of pediatrics at Harvard Medical School. If your baby seems constipated, discuss adding a little fruit juice to his diet with his pediatrician. Myth:  When you introduce solids, use jarred food because it's healthier. Fact:  Jarred baby food is convenient and healthy, ""but it doesn't contain any nutritional magic,"" says Ellyn Satter, author of  Child of Mine: Feeding With Love and Good Sense.  Although it's more work, it's just as healthy to start a baby older than 6 months on homemade foods (before then, just breast milk or formula is appropriate). ""And giving your baby a taste of your meals will introduce her to new flavors and may make her more curious about food,"" says Satter. At first, try cooked, pureed apples, pears, peaches, carrots, corn, green beans, potatoes, or peas. You can also mash ripe bananas and avocados. By the time she's 9 months old, your baby can eat fish, chicken, turkey, beef, and soy foods that have been chopped up in a food processor. However, do not serve canned soups, processed meats, or frozen entrees to children under age 1, since high-sodium foods are hard for them to digest, says William Dietz, M.D., a pediatrician and the director of the division of Nutrition and Physical Activity at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in Atlanta. You should also stick to jarred rather than homemade spinach, beets, collard greens, and squash until your child is 8 months old, since homemade versions can contain nitrates, which, in rare cases, may impair the ability of a baby's blood to carry oxygen to tissues. Myth:  It's not healthy for kids to eat red meat and eggs regularly. Fact:  You may need to cut back on eating red meat and eggs, but your child doesn't. They're an excellent source of protein, and provide plenty of iron and zinc, essential nutrients for growing children, says Dr. Dietz. While it's healthy to serve red meat and eggs a few times a week, skip the fast-food hamburger. Instead, grill burgers at home or make meatballs. If you're going to offer eggs, only prepare cooked (rather than runny) yolks, and to reduce allergy risks don't serve the whites until age 1. Myth:  If your child rejects a food, there's no point in serving it again. Fact:  Research shows that a toddler may have to try a new food 15 times before she'll eat more than a spoonful. So when your 2-year-old spits out your homemade lasagna, don't take it personally. Her reaction may be more surprise than dislike. Serve it again-- she may astonish you by loving it. It's good to offer new foods as many times as you can-- just be willing to take no for an answer. To cut back on everyone's frustration, serve new dishes along with old favorites, such as milk, rice, bread, or noodles: Your child won't leave the table hungry, and you won't constantly have to pop up and prepare her something special to eat. Myth:  Children prefer to eat exactly the same foods over and over. Fact:  If your child has ever gone on a food jag, refusing to eat anything except pasta or pancakes for weeks on end, you might think that this is true. And children do enjoy eating some (usually white) foods repeatedly. But they also have a strong instinct to experience new flavors. ""The more variety a child is offered, the more she'll eat,"" says Roberts. So prepare new vegetables, fruits, and meats in different ways, and your child may be more inclined to eat them: Toss chicken into a salad, sprinkle cheese or dressing on top of broccoli, or add carrots to spaghetti sauce. Myth:  Introduce veggies before fruits, or he'll get used to the sweet taste of fruits and refuse vegetables. Fact:  There's no evidence that offering fruits first will discourage children from eating vegetables, says Susan Roberts, Ph.D., author of  Feeding Your Child for Lifelong Health.  But no matter what you offer first, introduce any new food slowly: Try a different one every three to four days, and then monitor your baby to make sure he doesn't develop a rash or an upset stomach-- signs of an allergy. Myth:  Kids don't need supplements. Fact:  It's often been thought that a healthy diet supplies a child with all essential nutrients, but according to one study, more than 50 percent of American children fall short on at least one vitamin or mineral, and 11 percent are slightly anemic. So talk to your doctor about giving your child a multivitamin/multimineral supplement. If he thinks she needs one, buy one that offers between 50 and 150 percent of the Daily Value of nutrients that 2- to 4-year-olds require. Myth:  Limit how much your child eats so he doesn't become overweight. Fact:  Young children are good at regulating their food intake, so portion control is likely to backfire, says Dr. Dietz. If kids routinely go hungry, they learn to stuff themselves whenever unrestricted amounts of food are available-- a habit that can result in weight problems later on. For an overweight child, serve limited quantities of highly caloric foods, like macaroni and cheese, at mealtimes, but extra helpings of fruits and vegetables, so he can still leave the table feeling satisfied, says Dr. Dietz. And find ways to get him to exercise. Myth:  If you sweeten your child's vegetables, eventually she won't eat them any other way. Fact:  Vegetables help protect against cancer and heart disease, and you should encourage your child to eat them any way you can, says Roberts. And if she gets into the habit of having them regularly, she may start to like them plain once she's older. So feel free to top sweet potatoes, yams, and squash with marshmallows, or sprinkle peas and green beans with a teaspoon of sugar. You can also use the same tactic with tart fruits-- slice up a kiwi or pineapple and cover it with colored sprinkles. Such small amounts of sugar won't contribute to a sweet tooth, if offered with healthy foods rather than with cakes. When it comes to feeding your child, remember there's room to make mistakes, says Roberts: ""We all do our best, and our best is good enough.""

 The Growing Baby's Guide to Nutrition,http://www.parenting.com/article/growing-babys-guide-to-nutrition,"One of the thrills of being a parent is watching your child take that first spoonful of mushy baby food. It's a milestone you'll never forget, and as she advances to chunkier solids and eventually real family meals, both baby's and mom's pleasure increase. But how do you know when your little one is ready for a new food experience? And what should you be feeding her in the meantime to optimize her health? To aid in your food shopping and preparation, here's a guide organized by age group, along with suggested items for nutritious -- and delicious -- daily dining. 6 Months: The Experimental Stage WHAT TO FEED:  Breast milk or formula should make up the bulk of baby's diet for the first six months, meeting most of his nutritional needs. Between 4 and 6 months, you should gradually ease solids into your child's meals. Start with a good source of iron, especially if your infant has been breastfed. (Infant formula has iron added.) Iron-deficiency anemia is a health concern, so it's a must-have mineral for your baby. The best source of iron is red meat or poultry. The next best source is fortified cereals, with whole-grain cereals being better than rice cereal. Mix cereal with enough breast milk or formula to create a liquid consistency, and feed with a spoon. Once he's accepted this, you can offer strained fruits and vegetables. Start with single-ingredient foods; this way, if there are any allergic reactions (rash, vomiting or extremely loose stools), identifying the source won't be an issue. Offer baby about a half-teaspoonful of food at a time. At 7 to 9 months, you should add strained meats and poultry (another great source of iron and protein), and by 10 months, you can begin the transition to table food by offering teething biscuits for baby to gum and mashed foods to introduce a little texture. Making your own baby food is an option, but commercial baby food is safe and nutritious too. Frank Greer, M.D., professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin and former chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics National Committee on Nutrition, points out one advantage to jarred baby food is that it's preserved. ""Home preparations are not sterilized, so moms have to be careful to wash everything very well,"" he says. ""Also, homemade baby food can't be kept around very long. If it hasn't been eaten after two days, throw it out."" Moms who are concerned about preservatives but don't have the time to make baby food at home can try one of the organic baby food lines such as Earth's Best and Gerber Organic. WHAT'S GOING ON AT THIS STAGE:  The introduction of solids is a social learning exercise for baby. ""Children want to be part of the family unit, and eating together is important,"" says nutritionist Althea Zanecosky, R.D., former spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association and mother of two. ""Sit baby in a high chair and pull it up to the table. Even if he rejects the food you're trying that day, you're teaching him that food is a social activity. He'll learn that this is the time we put away the toys and we're all together."" WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR:  When introducing new foods, it's important to watch for signs of food intolerance. Offer baby a small amount of one new food for several days before moving onto the next. Avoid feeding your baby honey, which can cause infant botulism, a form of food poisoning, and citrus fruits, which are too acidic for young stomachs. Zanecosky notes that while eggs and nuts have a reputation as infant allergens, they are actually fine. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) changed its stance on delaying the introduction of common allergens in 2008. ""Many pediatricians recommend against giving eggs and fish in the first year of life because of allergic reactions, but there is no evidence that introducing these nutrient-dense foods after 4 to 6 months of age determines whether your baby will be allergic to them,"" she explains. Experts also advise that you pay attention to baby's signals of hunger and fullness. By 6 months, an infant will show his desire to eat by opening his mouth and leaning forward. When baby turns his face or mouth away, he's telling you he's finished eating for now. 12 Months: Expanding Culinary Horizons WHAT TO FEED:  By 1 year, baby should be comfortably eating table food. A variety of healthful choices should meet her protein, energy and vitamin needs. Keep in mind that despite having a mouthful of teeth, babies process food by mashing it with their gums, so the table foods shouldn't be too tough. Here's a good test: Try to mash and dissolve the food in your mouth without chewing or biting down. If you're successful, baby should be as well. Breastfeeding may continue at this age, but whole milk is a very important part of a 1-year-old diet as well. ""Children under 2 need whole milk for brain, bone and nervous system development,"" explains Greer. However, Zanecosky notes the AAP's new 2008 milk guidelines, which advise parents to switch to reduced-fat milk for toddlers between 1 and 2 years old if a toddler is overweight or obese, or if there is a family history of obesity, high cholesterol or cardiovascular disease. Focus on good eating habits overall. Don't offer too many fried foods or sweets that are high in fat, and give your tot nutritious snacks like fresh fruit or graham crackers. Offer 100 percent whole-wheat bread or whole grains instead of white bread. WHAT'S GOING ON AT THIS STAGE:  ""Babies are learning about taste and texture, as taste buds and swallowing skills come together between 12 and 18 months,"" says Janice E. Stuff, Ph.D., R.D., assistant professor at the USDA/ARS Children's Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ""So if your child rejects a certain food, try again later. Or, if she's pushing food around, it means she's had enough. Put her plate aside -- in an hour she may want it again."" Studies show that babies eat when they're hungry and don't eat when they're not. ""Children have a wonderful ability to self-regulate,"" Zanecosky says. ""You really have to listen to their cues. If they're not hungry, don't force them to eat, even if it's inconvenient for you. Bring portable food with you for them to eat later."" WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR:  If, like many kids, baby rejects vegetables, you can substitute fruits, which have many of the same nutrients. For example, both zucchini and cantaloupe are good sources of vitamin A. Start with the zucchini on the plate, but keep cantaloupe available as a backup.   18 Months: Try Everything WHAT TO FEED:  By 1 1/2, toddlers are more adept at eating finger foods or using a spoon, but they still require supervision at mealtime. Serve table food cut in very small pieces, and avoid choking hazards like popcorn, hard candy, hot dogs, jellybeans, chunks of carrots, grapes and raisins. It's important not to rely on milk -- breast or otherwise -- as the sole source of key nutrients at this point. ""Keep trying a variety of foods, using the major food groups as a guide,"" says Greer. WHAT'S GOING ON AT THIS STAGE:  At this age, baby will point, try to articulate a word for food, or bang his fists or a utensil on the high chair tray if he's still interested in eating. It's perfectly fine to offer more until your little one indicates he's had enough. A food baby rejected at 12 months might be acceptable to him at 18 months, and having family members as role models will encourage him to try new foods. If baby sees his sister eating her vegetables, he'll try his too. WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR:  Your child isn't likely to eat the ideal balance of nutritious foods every day at this stage of life. What matters is that he meets these requirements over several days or even a week. If you feel he's not eating enough or have special concerns, speak to your pediatrician about whether vitamin drops or nutritional supplements are necessary."
,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/fertility-files/monday-blues,"I got my period. I'm not gonna lie  I'm disappointed. I know, I know, it was unlikely I'd get pregnant on our first try. But hey, it was a possibility. We did have sex a million times last month  we gave those sperm plenty of chances. Rationally, I know that getting pregnant can take a long time, but I didn't realize until after I got my period this morning just how much I was hoping I was pregnant. I mean, each time I took my prenatal vitamins over the last two weeks, I really thought, maybe this is helping a fetus right now. Turns out it was just more nutrients for me. But I had every warning I was getting my period: I was depressed and on the verge of tears on Friday (classic PMS for me); my boobs were sore (also PMS for me, but I was hoping it was pregnancy boob soreness and not period boob soreness); and I was eating like a maniac (again, typical PMS for me). So it shouldn't have been a surprise that I got my period. And it wasn't. But I'm still sad. My husband isn't nearly as disappointed as I am. ""I got my period,"" I told him this morning, as I walked out of the bathroom. ""We'll get 'em next time, Babe,"" he said, looking up briefly from his  New York Times . I know he didn't mean to sound as though we'd only just lost an intramural volleyball game, so I gave him another chance to react. ""You're not thinking anything else right now?"" He put the paper down and looked up at me. ""Well, yeah, I'm disappointed. But we knew it would probably take a while."" ""Really, you're disappointed, too?"" ""Sure. It also makes me wonder a little bit why it didn't work, but most people don't get pregnant their first try. So we'll just try again. It'll be okay."" I sat down next to him and put my head on his chest. He put his arms around me. We sat there for a little while like that, and eventually I got up to go to the gym. ""Let's have sushi for dinner,"" I said on my way out the door. If I'm not pregnant, I might as well live it up."
 Are Food-Additives Unsafe?,http://www.parenting.com/article/are-food-additives-unsafe,"Potassium sorbate. Propionic acid.  Ingredient  lists often read like the answers to a high school chemistry exam. Should you be concerned? An additive can't be put in food unless the Food and Drug Administration has ruled it's safe. But most nutritionists suggest limiting overall intake, and you may want to avoid some altogether. In general, foods with many additives undergo processing that can destroy nutrients, says JoAnn Hattner, a pediatric nutritionist at Stanford University Medical Center. A guide to some commonly used additives: PRESERVATIVES Function:  To prevent spoilage Found in:  Vegetable oil, salad dressing, bread, baked goods, crackers, processed meat (such as hot dogs and lunch meat), cheese, fruit juice, cereal Safe:  Potassium sorbate, propionic acid, sodium benzoate, tocopherols (vitamin E), citric acid Problematic:  Nitrites (the body can convert them into carcinogens); sulfites (can trigger an allergic reaction in some people) EMULSIFIERS AND STABILIZERS Function:  To keep foods (like oil and vinegar) from separating, and to provide a consistent texture Found in:  Salad dressing, peanut butter, baked goods, bread, cereal, chocolate, pudding, mayonnaise, margarine, cream cheese, soup, jam, jelly Safe:  Monoglycerides, diglycerides, polysorbate, sorbitan monostearate, lecithin, guar gum, modified starches Problematic:  None COLORINGS Function:  To make food look more appealing and sometimes to protect light-sensitive vitamins Found in:  Cheese, margarine, ice cream, candy, gelatin, jelly, pudding, baked goods Safe:  Annatto, beta-carotene, beet juice, FD&C Red dye #40, FD&C Yellow dye #6 Problematic:  FD&C Red dye #3 (linked to cancer in animal studies) FLAVORINGS Function:  To enhance taste Found in:  Baked goods, chewing gum, canned fruit, fruit yogurt, candy, chocolate, gelatin, pudding, salad dressing, soft drinks, Chinese food, canned vegetables, soup, processed meat Safe:  Dextrose, fructose, sucrose, mannitol, disodium gyanylate Problematic:  MSG (can cause headaches and chest pain; pregnant women should avoid); sorbitol (can produce stomach pain and diarrhea); saccharin (linked to cancer in animal studies)"
 Surviving Food Fads,http://www.parenting.com/article/surviving-food-fads,"A child who demands pancakes morning, noon, and night could drive any parent nuts. But such high-maintenance behavior is typical of toddlers. ""They love repetition,"" says Paula Peters, Ph.D., associate professor of human  nutrition  at Kansas State University, in Manhattan, KS. ""And choosing what they'll eat is one of the first ways they assert their independence."" Most food fads last only a couple of weeks, though it can seem like an eternity, especially if you're concerned about your child's diet, says Peters. ""But if you consistently offer him different healthy foods, he'll eventually take in all the nutrients he needs."" To get through a food kick: GIVE IN TO CRAVINGS.  ""Matter-of-factly give your child his favorite food, but put just a small amount of it on his plate so that he samples other dishes,"" suggests Peters. DON'T FORBID A FOOD. A recent study at Penn State University suggests that (as any seasoned parent could have told you) restricting a food increases its appeal. Instead of banning your child's favorite, set some limits-- offering a half a fruit bar, for instance, rather than a whole. SERVE UP HEALTHY FARE.  ""When a food kick ends, you want nutritious choices available,"" says Robert Squires, M.D., associate professor of pediatrics at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, in Dallas. So always offer fruits, vegetables, and whole-grain breads. HAVE A TWO-BITE RULE.  ""Encourage a child older than age 3 to take two bites of everything served,"" says Dr. Squires. ""Then let him have what he wants."" And be realistic-- a spoonful doesn't have to be heaping. ROLL WITH THE PUNCHES.  Remain calm, even if food ends up on the floor. You don't want dinnertime to become a battleground."
 Cooking Shortcuts,http://www.parenting.com/article/cooking-shortcuts-21354658,"You've already pared down your  meals  from fine cuisine to microwavable mac-and-cheese -- so is spending even less time cooking a possibility? Yes! Here's what moms from across the country are doing to save time in the kitchen and make more time for everywhere else.  A crock in the plan     Cut up meats and veggies in the morning and toss them into a crockpot. Plug it in before you head out so the food will cook while you're at work or doing errands. -- Charmaine Markus, New Scotland, NY Make a weekly menu    On the weekend, plan your dinners for the whole week, then shop accordingly. Be sure to make room for leftovers and sandwiches so you only have to cook a few nights a week. -- Julia Baker, Chicago, IL Double up    Whenever you cook, make more than you need and store the extras for another night. -- Caroline Power Gangl, Hershey, PA Can it    Stock your pantry with a variety of canned tomatoes, olives, and beans to spruce up dishes and boost your nutrient intake. Use the tomatoes and beans in a chili, toss the beans or olives over a salad, or mix any of them in a rice dish. -- Jessica Mandell, East Brunswick, NJ The big chill    Invest in a second fridge or freezer (secondhand will do). Stock it with frozen veggies, meats, and healthy leftovers. You'll always have the food on hand and ready to cook. -- Jen Grogono, Austin, TX Cut it out    Buy pre-chopped onions and garlic. They're more expensive, but the time you save on chopping is worth it. -- Jennifer Mileti, Shaker Heights, OH Wok this way    Chop up veggies and meat in the morning, and store them in the fridge. When it's time to make dinner, toss everything in a wok for a fast stir-fry. Experiment with different combinations to keep it interesting. -- Charmaine Markus Make dinner at lunchtime    While you're getting things out for lunch, gather the ingredients and utensils you plan to use for dinner as well. Cut up veggies for a salad or throw together a lasagna (with precooked noodles) that you'll cook later.  -- Dorie Valenti, Delmar, NY"
 Amniotic Fluid: What You Need to Know,http://www.parenting.com/article/amniotic-fluid-what-you-need-to-know,"The liquid surrounding your baby-to-be is much more than a watery home: It's a cushion that protects the fetus from physical trauma (if you fall, for instance), a shield against infection, and a backup source of fluid and nutrients. It also helps the baby's digestive and respiratory systems develop properly. During your first 16 weeks, this fluid is produced by the placenta, the fetus's skin, and the umbilical cord. After that, it consists also of recycled urine: The fetus swallows the liquid, which is processed through the kidneys and excreted in a continuous cycle. You have 800 to 1,000 milliliters of fluid by your third trimester (three-and-a-half to just over four cups), says Brian S. Carter, M.D., associate professor of pediatrics at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, in Nashville, TN. Your doctor can check your amniotic fluid by ultrasound if he suspects a problem. When Levels Are Too High: Too much amniotic fluid can indicate a birth defect, such as a gastrointestinal blockage, or in some cases a chromosomal problem in the fetus. Signs of excess fluid (which affects 1 percent of pregnant women) include decreased fetal movement and a noticeable increase in the size of the babys abdomen. No need to worry though: Most women with this condition go on to deliver healthy babies. When Levels Are Too Low: An inadequate amount of fluid, which affects 4 percent of expectant women, can be caused by a tear in the amniotic membrane, problems with the placenta, or an infection, such as an STD. Without enough amniotic fluid to float in, a fetus can sit on the umbilical cord and cut off its blood supply, and if amniotic fluid volume is too low for many weeks, the baby might be born prematurely, and/or with poor lung development and premature delivery. Signs of low amniotic fluid volume can include leaking fluid, a smaller-than-average belly on the mother, and decreased fetal movement. You're at greater risk if you have chronic high blood pressure. What You Can Do: If you suffer from either condition, your doctor will probably administer regular nonstress tests and ultrasounds for the rest of your pregnancy and, in some cases, may even put you on bed rest. Too much fluid may be treated with medication. Drinking an extra eight cups of water a day can help women with too little fluid increase their levels. Nichole Cipriani is a freelance writer."
 The Right Stuff,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-right-stuff,"Despite parents' worries, children will select a diet that's good for them if they are given the right foods to choose from. How you've handled food up to now will influence how your toddler reacts to new foods. Try to introduce them in a matter-of-fact way. Offer small amounts of a variety of foods to help your toddler understand the concept of choice. To make sure your child receives needed nutrients, plan meals around the five major food groups, those you've seen so often in the food pyramid: the bread, cereal, rice, and pasta group; fruits; vegetables; meat and fish; and dairy products. We spoke with Ann Shaw, Ph.D., a research nutritionist with the Human Nutrition Information Services (the agency that created the new food pyramid) to adapt the number of servings in each food group, as well as the serving sizes, for children ages 2 to 5. In general, children need about the same number of servings in each group as adults do, but their recommended serving sizes are approximately one-third smaller. When your child is younger than 2, her nutritional requirements and the amount of food she needs are somewhat different, so rely on your pediatrician's advice. All children under 2, for example, have a need for fat, which should not be limited in their diets. The most important thing you can do for your ""under 2"" is serve a wide variety of foods from each of the five food groups. For all young children, Shaw says, snacks should play an important role in fulfilling nutritional needs. Toddlers tend to have small appetites and may not be able to consume a full serving at one time. Also, large portions are often overwhelming, so start out with small portions. Your child can always ask for seconds. We also talked to five dietitians and asked for tips to ease the transition from infant feeding to the wider world of toddler nutrition. They've come up with some practical - and creative - advice that underscores the importance of your role in setting your kids up for a lifelong commitment to good nutrition. Breads, Cereal, Rice, and Pasta Toddlers need at least six servings from this food group every day. One serving consists of one third cup cooked pasta, cereal, or rice; two thirds of an ounce of ready-to-eat cereal; or two thirds of a slice of bread. Toddlers should consume a variety of breads, cereal, rice, and pasta so they receive enough fiber and carbohydrates, which provide energy. Toddlers need - and expend - tremendous amounts of energy. Also, many ready-to-eat cereals are enriched with iron and will help your child meet the daily requirement for this nutrient. This food group is one with which your toddler will be most familiar. Rice or barley cereal is the first solid introduced to a baby's diet. Soon they graduate to the little round cereal that is a perennial toddler favorite. Also, bits of bread, especially chewy bread and crackers, often soothe teething babies. Most toddlers can handle a small sandwich, and this is a good way to serve them bread, says Corinne Montandon, Ph.D., R.D., a nutritionist with Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. She recommends that you make sandwiches with nutritious whole-grain breads. Although many white breads are enriched (which means vitamins and minerals have been added), they don't contain as much fiber. Your child may like white bread, but now you need to broaden his tastes. Try making a sandwich with half white and half wheat bread, then cut it into small triangles and arrange some shapes white-side up and some brown-side up, and also point some toward the top of the plate and some toward the bottom. Don't forget to try other kinds of bread, too, such as bagels or pita bread. Montandon had these suggestions to help you add toddler appeal to some foods in this group:   Mix a surprise into hot cereals, such as raisins, dried apricots or apple bits (all cut into very small pieces to prevent choking). Keep a variety of these surprises on hand and let your toddler choose the surprise for the day.  Combine pasta with other things you want your toddler to eat: meat, cheeses, and vegetables. Macaroni and cheese and spaghetti and meat sauce are popular with toddlers.  Smear graham crackers with peanut butter.  Make mini grilled cheese sandwiches (cut a regular sandwich into quarters) or mini pizzas composed of English muffins, a little sauce, and grated cheese.  Offer a bedtime snack of cereal and milk. Many toddlers love this snack at the end of the day. Fruits and Vegetables To get the vitamins and minerals they need, children should eat three servings of vegetables and two servings of fruits every day. One serving equals two thirds cup of raw, leafy vegetable; one third cup of raw, cooked, or canned fruit or vegetable; a small piece of fruit; one half cup of fruit or vegetable juice; or one sixth cup dried fruit. These daily servings should include at least one vitamin C source (citrus fruits, strawberries, and melon) and one vitamin A source (deep green and yellow fruits and vegetables, such as peaches, carrots, spinach, broccoli, and squash). Read labels carefully when choosing canned or processed fruits and vegetables, says Trish Riley Vignati, R.D., a research nutritionist at Emory University School of Public Health in Atlanta. Check for added sugar and salt, especially in canned vegetables, which often have an enormous amount of added salt. Look for cans marked ""low-salt"" or ""no salt."" Check fruit juice labels carefully, too, to be sure the product is 100-percent juice. Many have added sugar or water. Children like the variety of bright colors and textures that fruits and vegetables offer, so it'll probably be easier than you might think to get your child to eat them. Vignati suggests these steps to make them even more enticing:   Take your toddler shopping and let him select one new fruit or vegetable on each trip.  Add fruits and vegetables (one at a time) to foods you already make. For example, add kiwi slices to yogurt or broccoli to spaghetti sauce.  Involve your child in preparing vegetables. Even a very young child can wash carrots.  Cut up a variety of vegetables (with or without help) and serve them raw or slightly steamed with a dip such as nonfat salad dressing. Meat and Fish To meet his protein requirements, a toddler's daily servings from this food group should add up to three and a half ounces of meat, fish, or the equivalent in meat alternatives such as cooked dried beans and eggs. One serving of meat or fish consists of one and two thirds ounces, and one serving of meat alternatives consists of one third cup cooked beans, one small egg, or one and one third tablespoons of peanut butter used in a sandwich. (These amounts are the equivalent of roughly an ounce of meat.) When serving meat to your toddler, make sure it's been cooked thoroughly. Cut the meat into pieces that are small enough for him to manage, yet not large enough to choke on. When you serve fish, be especially careful to pick through the entire portion and remove any bones. Because there are so many interesting ways to serve meats - in a vegetable stew, perhaps, or broiled or sauted - parents should be able to avoid giving children fried meat, says Yvonne Bronner, R.D., a nutritionist at the Johns Hopkins School of Hygiene and Public Health in Baltimore. To make meat dishes as healthy as possible, remove excess fat and skin before preparing. Steering your kids clear of high-fat tastes early on gives them a head start on a lifetime of healthy eating habits. Bronner says a great way to get your toddler to eat meat (and some vegetables, too) is to include him in the preparation of a Chinese stir-fry (under close supervision, of course). Cut up an assortment of colorful vegetables - red, green, and yellow peppers, broccoli, carrots - and slice up some chicken or beef. Let your child pick out the bits he wants for his dinner, drop them into the pan, and you can both watch them cook. Dairy Toddlers need at least three servings of dairy foods per day. One serving is equivalent to two thirds cup of yogurt, two thirds cup of milk, one ounce of natural cheese, or one and one third ounces of processed cheese. Dairy foods are an important source of protein and calcium - a vital nutrient for young children because it helps build strong bones. The right stuff for toddlers is similar to the right stuff for everyone. You'll just have to help get it down. Children should consume 800 milligrams of calcium every day. Milk and yogurt are particularly rich in calcium, and relying on them can help your child meet the daily calcium requirement. Three servings of milk or yogurt add up to two cups per day. A cup of milk contains 300 milligrams of calcium and a cup of yogurt contains 340 milligrams. Ask your doctor whether you should feed your toddler whole or low-fat milk. Cheese will add to the daily calcium count, but the amount of calcium in a serving of cheese varies from 175 to 300 milligrams, depending on the type. An ounce of American cheese, for example, has 175 milligrams and an ounce of cheddar has 200 milligrams. Many processed cheeses are convenient, but they're loaded with fat, so try not to serve them too often. In addition to the approximately 600 milligrams of calcium that's found in three servings of dairy foods, your child will get some calcium from other foods in his diet, including dark green leafy vegetables, bread products (which are usually calcium enriched), and even orange juice. Most children like milk but may reject yogurt because it has a slightly sour taste, says nutritionist Laraine Ludlow, who teaches a course for parents called ""Nutrition and Your Child"" at Westchester Community College in Valhalla, NY. To help your child cultivate a taste for yogurt, she recommends introducing it early on, at about the same time as milk. Ludlow also suggests dressing up yogurt and other dairy foods in these toddler-friendly ways:   Mix yogurt with granola and top with fruit for a healthy ""sundae.""  Whip up a nutritious shake by mixing a cup of vanilla yogurt and fruit in a blender.  Make a light cream sauce using yogurt, add some cheese, then toss with pasta.  Substitute milk for water when baking such foods as pancakes and cupcakes.  Add flavorings, such as a dash of chocolate syrup, to milk. (Although flavorings contain some sugar, for the child who won't take calcium in any other form, this solution helps you deliver a much-needed nutrient.)"
 More New Moms Eating Their Placentas,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/melanie-parentingcom/more-new-moms-eating-placentas,"Following the birth of my first son, I had no plans for my placenta other than to merely get it out of me. But during my second pregnancy, under the care of homebirth midwives, I requested that they save my placenta, for well, I dont know. I had vague plans to plant a tree in honor of my sons birth, and bury the placenta at the site, but here we are, two years later, with no new tree and the placenta still in a Ziploc bag in our garage deep-freeze with my husband threatening to use it as fish bait. Although most women in the U.S. have no intention of doing anything with their placenta, a small but growing number of women are choosing to eat it, according to  New York Magazine . Plus: Unborn Babies Will Eat Your Placenta While most of us know how vitally important an organ the placenta is during pregnancy, filtering toxins while passing vitamins, oxygen and other nutrients from mom to baby, an increasing number of new moms believe that a placenta still has plenty to offer after birth and are engaging in placentophagia, or the practice of placenta consumption.  Why, you might rightly ask?  Beyond the fact that virtually all land mammals do so (leading some to think that there must be a reason behind this natural compulsion), placenta contains plenty of iron, B-12 and certain hormones, which some believe increase a new moms strength and milk production and even stave off postpartum depression (although scientific studies have yet to back this up). Placenta Teddy Bears & Other Ridiculous Parenting Products While some hospitals have policies against releasing placentas to their former owners, those who have managed to tote them home along with their new babe have done everything from devouring placenta in stew, smoothie, jerky, or capsule form. And, like just about everything else nowadays, you can hire out your placenta prepwhich is a good thing, considering how tired us new moms are  before  getting to indulge in any placenta. Should we ever have another baby, Id actually consider the dehydration/encapsulation method (but I don't think I could stomach eating placenta for dinner)with three kids at home, Id think I could use any help I could get in getting back on my feet.

 USDA Dietary Guidelines for Children,http://www.parenting.com/article/usda-dietary-guidelines-children,"If we are what we eat, then American kids are Fritos. Thats just one of the major findings from the new USDA Dietary Guidelines. Fries and chips are the only vegetables on the list of top 25 calorie sources; fruit juice is the sole fruit to make the leaderboard. The prevalence of these foods plays a big role in the childhood-obesity epidemic, which affects far more than our childrens waist sizes. Many chronic conditions are on the rise among kids, including asthma, allergies, diabetes, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). And all of these conditions have been linked to what kids eat. Improving childrens diets in the following three areas that were addressed in the report would go a long way toward helping our kids stay healthy: Go low when it comes to salt.  Most kids over 2 consume too much sodium, which can lead to high blood pressure. White bread is kids biggest source of salt because they eat so much of it. Excess sodium is also hidden in many processed, frozen, and restaurant foods.  The fix:  Go with low-sodium whole grains when choosing bread. Eat at home more often, and choose fresh foods over frozen or processed products.   Get off the SoFAS!  This acronym may be the next buzzword in the childhood obesity discussion. SoFASsolid fats and added sugarsmake up a whopping 35 percent of our calories and have almost no nutritional value. These unhealthy fats, which are solid at room temperature, are found mostly in butter, stick margarine, and red meat. That means theyre in many childrens-menu staples: pizza, hot dogs, bacon, French fries, and desserts.  The fix:  Whenever possible, avoid these foods and use oils to replace solid fats when cooking. Watch the added sugars.  Sugars are healthy in whole foods like fruits and milk because these foods also contain nutrients that signal the body to use the sugar correctly. But when they are added to nutritionally empty foods (like many desserts), the natural process is thrown off.  The fix:  Make sweets an occasional treat in your family. Most important: View these findings as a road map to dietary change. Your childrens health depends on it. Alan Greene, M.D.   is a pediatrician and the author of the bestselling  Raising Baby Green.

 Study: Prenatal Vitamins Might Reduce Risk of Autism,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/sasha-parentingcom/study-prenatal-vitamins-might-reduce-risk-autism,"A new report underscores the importance of taking prenatal vitamins early in pregnancy, and even before you get pregnant. The study, to be published in the July issue of  Epidemiology , found that mothers who took the vitamins before getting pregnant or during the first month of pregnancy  were half as likely to later have a child with autism  as those who didn't. However, for women who began taking prenatal vitamins in the second month of pregnancy, there was no effect, which suggests that by the time many women learn they are pregnant, its too late for the vitamins to provide a benefit in terms of autism. The study was based on about 700 families who had 2- to 5-year-olds with autism. Plus: Autism Spectrum Disorders Health Guide The study also found increased risk for women who had two particular gene mutations when coupled with failure to take vitamins. One is the variant of the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene, which when coupled with no early prenatal vitamin intake, had a 4.5 times greater than normal risk of having a child with autism. Women with the catechol-O-methyltransferase (COMT) gene had a seven times greater risk when they didnt take their prenatals early on. Plus: The Importance of Folic Acid"
 More Anti-Vaccine Parents Refusing Vitamin K Shots for Newborns,http://www.parenting.com/news-break/more-anti-vaccine-parents-refusing-vitamin-k-shots-newborns,"The Short of It Doctors are reporting a growing trend among parents who are against vaccines also  refusing vitamin K shots  for their newborns, which can increase the risk of internal bleeding in the babies' brains or intestines. The Lowdown Vitamin K is an essential nutrient that assists the body in blood clot formation. The vitamin is formed in the established digestive systems in older children and adults, but not infants. And unfortunately, breast milk doesn't provide enough vitamin K to ward off possible bleeding disorders associated with vitamin K deficiencies. In addition to gastrointestinal and brain bleeding, babies with a vitamin K deficiency may have flecks of blood in their stool, be excessively fussy and have severe anemia, which is a shortage of healthy red blood cells. To keep newborns healthy, it's been routine in the United States since 1961 for babies to receive a vitamin K shot shortly after birth. Dr. Robert Sidonio, Jr., a hematologist and assistant professor of pediatrics at Emory University in Atlanta, says, the parents who are refusing the shots are probably believing a myth that grew out of one ""old"" study that said there was a correlation between the vitamin K shot and leukemia, but that data was refuted in several follow-up studies. He says a similar situation happened surrounding the MMR vaccine and autism. ""If you refuse the shot,  you're rolling the dice with your child's health ,"" Sidonio told Health Day News. ER doctors in Ohio and Tennessee have reported an increase in infants with vitamin K deficiency, and further investigating into those cases found the babies had not received their vitamin K shots. The Upshot There's a huge trend among parents to have completely natural birthing experiences, from refusing an epidural to taking a baby home from the hospital without it receiving any  vaccines . While parents mean well, I think the best ways to ensure a healthy experience is to ask doctors a lot of questions and research legitimate sources. If you're considering refusal of all vaccines, find out the consequences and benefits first. Then, make a decision based on what you know, not what trend you see other parents following.

 When Pregnancy Tastes Funny,http://www.parenting.com/article/when-pregnancy-tastes-funny,"Most pregnant women expect  morning sickness  and backaches, but few have heard about dysgeusia, or the ""bad taste problem."" This surprisingly common condition, likely caused by pregnancy hormones, can result in the absence of taste or altered taste, such as a metallic or bitter sensation, says Stacey Nelson, R.D., a senior clinical nutritionist at Massachusetts General Hospital, in Boston. Here's how you can combat the condition: Go sour Marinate meats in vinegar, soy sauceor citrus juices, as sour foods stimulate the taste buds and saliva production. Other ideas: Add lemons to water, drink lemon or lime seltzer and lemonade, or suck on citrus drops. Switching to plastic dinnerware from silverware can also help. Add salt If you're sensitive to sweets, add a dash of salt to tone down foods like canned fruits or jam. And opt for savory snacks, such as cheese, peanut butter or olives. Change vitamins Ask your provider about switching to a chewable prenatal vitamin, which may be easier to tolerate. Brush frequently Brush your teeth and tongue, and rinse with a baking soda solution (add 1/4 teaspoon soda to 1 cup water) which improves taste by neutralizing pH levels. Eat what you can Don't feel guilty if healthy foods turn you off, says Nelson. Most taste changes will dissipate by the second trimester, when you can reintroduce them. If you're worried that your food aversions are resulting in poor nutrition, talk to your health care provider."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Whole or Two Percent?,http://www.parenting.com/article/whole-or-two-percent,"Q:   Our pediatrician wanted me to introduce our one-year-old to two percent  milk  instead of whole milk. The doctor says that she doesn't need all of the harmful fat in the whole milk and that they have equal amounts of vitamins. Is this correct, and is this okay for her, developmentally speaking? A:  Your pediatrician is correct. As babies grow into toddler years, most do not need the extra fat of whole milk and do just fine with two percent milk. Yet the question of when to switch from whole to low-fat milk depends upon your toddler's overall nutrition. In my pediatric practice, I usually wait until two years of age to switch a toddler from whole milk to two percent milk. The reason why has more to do with toddlers' temperament rather than developmental needs: Most toddlers are picky eaters and need the extra fat for extra calories. If your toddler has an overall balanced diet, then  switching to two percent milk is fine . As your pediatrician mentioned, low-fat and whole milk have equal amounts of vitamins and minerals. In fact, an 8-ounce glass of low-fat milk contains more protein than an 8-ounce glass of whole milk (10 grams versus 8 grams). Whole milk contains 3.5 to 4 percent fat, and this extra fat is primarily saturated fat, which your toddler can do without. But your growing toddler still needs fat in his diet. That is why I do not advise giving skim milk to infants and toddlers. Toddlers are picky eaters for two reasons: They have tiny tummies (about the size of their fist), and toddlers don't like to sit still for anything, let alone to eat. Fat provides twice as many calories per gram as do carbohydrates and proteins. Also, healthy fats are a necessary component of the vital tissuesespecially the brain and central nervous systemthat are growing so fast in your toddler. So, when you switch to two percent milk, you must add other healthy fats to your baby's diet. As you make changes to your child's diet, I'd like you to remember my guide for toddler feeding: Feed your toddler a  right- fat and not a low-fat diet. The best fats for babies are omega-3 fats, found in oily, coldwater fish, primarily salmon. Seafood fats (especially wild salmon) are the healthiest fats for growing childrenand for adults for that matter. Other healthy fats are flax oil (2-3 teaspoons a day mixed in oatmeal or a smoothie), olive oil (2-3 teaspoons a day)and nut butters (a tablespoon a day). Best to wait until two before introducing peanut butter, especially if there is a strong family history of food allergies. Almond butter is usually a safer alternative. Pediatricians and nutritionists agree that one of the most unhealthy trends in the past 20 years is children switching from milk to sweetened beverages. It's important to reverse that trend and encourage your child to drink more water and milk and less sugar-sweetened beverages. The best thing about milk is that it is power-packed nutrition for typically picky eaters. An 8-ounce glass of milk contains 8-10 grams of protein and 300 milligrams of calciumthat's 35 percent of the daily value (DV) for children. It also has half of the DV for vitamin B-2, 30 percent of the DV for B-12, ten percent of the DV for zinc, 25 percent of the DV for vitamin Dand ten percent of the DV for vitamin A. By comparison, an 8-ounce can of soda contains none of this. In order to remember the different types of milk to give your children at different ages, I give my patients the following guide: No cow's milk before age one (because of allergies). Whole milk until two. Nonfat or low-fat after that."
 Healthy Drinks for Kids,http://www.parenting.com/article/healthy-drinks-kids,"What kid wouldnt want to try your fizzy pink soda or foamy vanilla latte? While a taste here and there isnt a big deal, its best to stick with the classics when it comes to daily drinks: milk, a little juiceand lots of plain ol water. Babies get most of the fl uids they need during the first year from breast milk or formula. But water is best for keeping kids older than 1 hydrated and healthy, and staving off fatigue, muscle weaknessand headaches. Developing a taste for water is important because kids who consume too many sweetened beverages may come to expect that every drink should be sugary, explains Nicolas Stettler, M.D., an associate professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition. Here, the lowdown on all things liquid, and how often your child should sip: Anytime Milk Give whole milk to kids ages 1 to 2 (unless theres a family history of obesity or heart disease, in which case reduced-fat milk can be considered, but talk with your pediatrician first). Fat-free milk is best after age 2; it has all the vitamin D and calcium your child needs, without the added calories. Water As needed, depending on activity level, climateand weight . No H2O fans in your house? Try flavoring it with crushed berries , or decorate it with funny straws or ice cubes. Once in a While Vitamin and coconut waters If you decide to offer one, choose a drink thats sugar-free. Just know that these are simply tinted water with added vitamins (which kids usually get enough of in their regular diet). Sometimes Juice Serve only 100 percent juice, without added sugar. Kids ages 1 to 6 years can have four to six ounces a day. Too much adds a lot of calories and not as much fi ber as a piece of fruit, says Dr. Stettler. Almost Never Soda, coffeetea; energy and sports drinks Soda is basically liquid candy, offering  nothing of nutritional value.  And caffeine (in coffee, teaand most energy drinks) is a stimulant plus, its addictive. For a special occasion, a bit of soda is fine, but it shouldnt be something kids drink with any regularity, says Dr. Stettler."
 The Savvy Mom's Guide to Sun Safety,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-savvy-moms-guide-to-sun-safety,"Myth #1: A suntan's fine, as long as you don't burn. Reality:  While even one sunburn may double the chance of eventually developing melanoma (the most serious type of skin cancer), your kids are still at risk even if they never burn. ""The more sun you get, the more likely you are to develop certain skin cancers,"" says Martin Weinstock, M.D., chairman of the American Cancer Society's (ACS) Skin Cancer Advisory Group, no matter what your skin tone. ""Any tan indicates damage to your skin."" Myth #2: A beach umbrella blocks the sun. Reality:  It's not foolproof. Sand reflects 17 percent of UV radiation, so you're still exposed, says Dr. Weinstock. Nevertheless, it's smart to stay in the shade when the sun's rays are high; just make sure you're also slathered with sunscreen. Myth #3: Sun can't penetrate through windows. Reality:  Glass filters out only one kind of radiation -- UVB rays. But UVA rays, which penetrate deeper, can still get through. That's why many adults have more freckles on their left side than their right -- it's from UV exposure on that side through the car window when driving. To protect yourself, apply sunscreen to any exposed areas (like your hands, forearms, and face) before getting into your car, especially in the spring and summer months, says Anthony Mancini, M.D., head of pediatric dermatology at Children's Memorial Hospital in Chicago. If you're buying a new car, consider one with tinted windows, which keep out almost four times more UVA light than regular ones. You don't need to worry about putting on sunscreen when indoors unless you or your child spends most of your time near a window (for example, if your child's desk is right next to one). Myth #4: Too much sunscreen causes vitamin D deficiency. Reality:  You may have read that extra exposure to sunshine is needed to help your body make vitamin D. But according to the ACS, the American Academy of Dermatology (AAD), and the Skin Cancer Foundation (SCF), both kids and adults get plenty of this nutrient through multivitamins, vitamin D-rich foods (like milk and fortified orange juice), and everyday sun exposure. Also, even if you're wearing sunscreen, small amounts of UV rays still penetrate your skin, and that's more than enough to help your body produce vitamin D. Myth #5: If it's cool or cloudy outside, you don't need sunscreen. Reality:  According to the SCF, up to 80 percent of the sun's UV rays can pass through clouds. This is the reason people often end up with serious sunburns on overcast days if they've spent time outside with no sun protection. Even in the winter months, you need to beware: Snow can reflect up to 80 percent of UV rays, increasing exposure. This is especially true if your family's on a ski vacation -- the higher your altitude, the greater your UV exposure. Myth #6: Eighty percent of sun damage occurs before the age of 18. Reality:  Contrary to previous estimates, recent studies show that we get less than 25 percent of our total lifetime sun exposure before age 18. That means you get the majority of it later on. So while you absolutely should be vigilant about protecting your kids, make sure you take care of yourself, too. While 83 percent of parents arm their kids with sunscreen and protective clothing whenever they're outdoors, only two-thirds practice what they preach, according to a 2005 AAD survey. ""Remember, kids don't always pay attention to what you say -- it's more about what you do,"" says Dr. Weinstock. ""If you're making them wear sunscreen but baking yourself, you're sending them a mixed message they may carry into adulthood."" More sun-safety facts Cover up Think that T-shirt protects your kid from UV rays? Think again. A white T-shirt has an SPF of about 7, but once it gets wet, SPF drops down to about 3, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation. ""In general, the easiest way to test if a fabric can protect your skin is to hold it up to the light -- if you can see through it, then UV radiation can penetrate it,"" says Dr. Weinstock. This means you need to apply sunscreen underneath the clothes (and don't forget wide-brimmed hats to shield the face and eyes). Also consider using a laundry aid such as SunGuard, which blocks about 96 percent of UV rays when washed into regular clothes. You might also try some treated SPF clothing. A few of our favorites:  Cabana Life Melanoma Is your child at risk?Between 1973 and 2001, childhood melanoma cases increased almost 3 percent every year. The good news is that melanoma in kids is still rare: In children under 10, the incidence is one in a million. ""There's no need to be alarmed by every skin imperfection in your child, but if you have a family history, your child is fair and/or has a lot of moles, make sure she gets skin exams with a dermatologist,"" says Susan Chon, M.D., assistant professor of dermatology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston."
 Your Top Food Questions Answered,http://www.parenting.com/article/your-top-food-questions-answered,"If I were to add up all the minutes I spend talking with patients' parents about different topics, there's no doubt which one would win: feeding. Every relative and her neighbor has advice, much of it contradictory (start with  vegetables  versus start with fruits, babies need teeth for table food versus no, they don't). And everyone seems certain she's right. Plus, the news is so full of nutritional directives that it can be dizzying. We feel judged as parents based on the eating habits of our children, and we want so much for them to eat well and grow well; it's hard not to feel overwhelmed trying to figure out how best to feed them. Thirteen years of parenting and doctoring have taught me a lot about feeding kids--enough to help parents relax and even enjoy the process. Here, answers to some of the questions I'm asked most:  Claire McCarthy, M.D., a pediatrician at the Martha Eliot Health Center, in Boston, is on the faculty of Harvard Medical School. She is the author of  Learning How the Heart Beats: The Making of a Pediatrician  (Penguin) . When to start solids Q. When should I start my baby on solids? A.  The most common mistake is to start too early. Which I can understand--getting out the spoon and watching your child do the baby-bird thing with her mouth can be lots of fun. My husband and I looked forward to it with each of our children (now 13, 11, 6, and 3). Many moms and dads are told by friends and family that their baby will sleep better when she's on solids too, and, of course, what new parent isn't dying for more shut-eye? But babies aren't ready for solids until 4 to 6 months. They aren't ready developmentally and could choke on the simplest of foods. And their intestines can't handle anything more complicated than breast milk or formula. Introducing solids too early may also be linked to later food allergies and eczema. Your baby's ready for her first taste of solid food when she can hold her head up easily and sit well with support--by that I mean she shouldn't slump down into a ball if you put her in an infant seat. She should also have some clue as to what to do with a spoon and its contents. If she doesn't seem much interested, sticks out her tongue a lot while you feed her, doesn't swallow the food, or gets fussy, she may need a little more time. Don't mix the food in the bottle; wait until she's ready to take it from a spoon. If there's a strong family history of food allergies--at least one parent has or had them, and perhaps a sibling as well--it's best to wait until 6 months and to talk to your doctor about which foods to avoid. When you do begin, keep it simple; that's the other common mistake people make. Once, I saw a mother giving her 4-month-old part of a hamburger! While going that fast is rare, it's easy to get excited and move beyond what's good for your baby. Rice cereal mixed with breast milk or formula is a good place to begin because you can easily adjust the consistency to what your baby can handle. After that, go ahead and introduce single-ingredient foods (you can make your own--just don't add salt, sugar, or spices, and be sure to strain out any lumps). Allow a few days between each new food while you watch for such reactions as rashes, diarrhea, vomiting, and fussiness. Why is my toddler so picky? Q. My 2-year-old could eat Cheerios for all three meals--in fact, he sometimes does-and he refuses to eat vegetables. What should I do? A.  My second child, Zachary, was exactly the same way starting around age 2. It caught me off guard, since his older sister, Michaela, loved vegetables and was open to new foods. I thought I had this whole teaching-kids-to-eat-well thing down, and was feeling proud of myself, until Zack came along and reminded me to be more humble. Food jags and flat-out refusing certain foods are quite common in older toddlers and preschoolers. Fighting them head-on is likely to lead to frustration--for you and your child--and some incredibly unpleasant mealtimes. Creativity and patience are better tactics. Creativity can mean playfulness--broccoli forests, sandwiches cut with cookie cutters, or making silly faces with food on the plate. It can also mean being a little sneaky, doing things such as pureeing vegetables and putting them into sauces or soup. Kids like dipping, so setting out some ranch dressing or other dips may help the vegetable cause. Involving your children in cooking--they can help pick recipes, stir, and get ingredients for you--may make them more interested in eating as well. If nothing works, just keep offering vegetables and other foods. One day your child may surprise you (Zack did in elementary school, when he suddenly started to eat salad). In the meantime, speak with your pediatrician about giving your son a chewable multivitamin with iron. Is it okay to give my baby ""grownup"" foods?"" Q. My 7-month-old wants to eat what we're eating at dinnertime. Is it okay to give her some? A  It depends--on her eating, development, and what you're having for supper. Most babies become ready for table foods between 6 and 9 months. If she's been eating baby foods well and hasn't had any reactions, it's okay to begin broadening her horizons. If she's shown any signs of a food allergy (such as rashes and vomiting), consult your doctor before making forays into table foods. Start with things that are soft and easy for her to gum, such as mashed potatoes (or other cooked veggies--mashing them with the back of a fork usually works well), finely shredded chicken, and rice. (By the way, babies don't actually need teeth to eat these--they can do remarkably well without them.) If she gags or chokes, wait a month before trying again. Once she can manage the table foods you give her, she may be ready to try feeding herself. She should be able to sit well enough to graduate from an infant seat to a high chair and have at least a beginning ability to pick up small things with her fingers. Foods should be cut into bite-size pieces and be as mushy as possible. Try overcooked pasta, Cheerios, pieces of baked or boiled potato, bits of banana, and well-cooked beans. Avoid the following, which are high on the most-choked-upon list: sliced cooked carrots (they can block little windpipes if cut horizontally--dice them small instead), raw carrots, nuts, popcorn, hot dogs, grapes, raisins, and round candies. Be wary of teething biscuits; chunks that are big enough for a child to choke on can break off when mixed with saliva. The same goes for bagels and big pretzels. I once had to do a Heimlich maneuver in the grocery store when Michaela choked on a piece of a big pretzel she was sucking on. It's no fun learning lessons that way! Are vitamins necessary? Q. Should I give my preschooler vitamins? A . Probably not, maybe yes. The vast majority of kids older than a year who eat at least a little bit of most foods, including meat, don't really need vitamins. (Younger children should take vitamins or iron only if prescribed by their doctor.) However, kids aren't always so obliging, and some diets may need to be supplemented. As I said earlier, if you've got a picky eater who's living off Cheerios, plain pasta, and not much else, a multivitamin with iron may be a good idea. Children on a vegetarian diet may have trouble getting enough iron, B vitamins, and zinc, so they, too, are likely candidates for a multi with iron. If you give your child vitamins, read the package carefully, as kids' formulations are generally geared for a certain age (usually not under 2) and the dose varies by brand-your child's dose might be half a tablet of one brand and a full one of another. Liquid preparations are available for kids under 2.Look for a multivitamin with calcium, since many kids these days don't get enough of that in their diet. It's always a good idea to read labels because the amount of different vitamins and minerals can vary significantly from one brand to another. Infants and toddlers who nurse a lot (so that the bulk of the milk they get is breast milk) and older children who drink less than 16 ounces of milk each day should take vitamin D. Some children may also need fluoride (after 6 months of age), depending on your water supply. Check with your pediatrician for recommendations based on your child's diet. A cautionary note on vitamins: Some of them taste as good as candy. Always keep them out of reach--taking too many can be dangerous. Should I try to ""fatten"" my child up? Q. My mother says that my 18-month-old daughter is too thin. Should I try to get her to eat more? A.  I hear this one a lot. Many grandmothers like chubby grandbabies; there's something about those rolls of fat that spells health to them. Unfortunately, rolls of fat aren't healthy and can lead to trouble down the road. Of course, if you also think that your child looks too thin, or if she's been having any symptoms of illness (like fever, loss of appetite, vomiting, diarrhea, and stomachache), take her to the doctor to be weighed and measured. But if she's healthy, her appetite is good, her clothes are getting steadily too small, and she's got plenty of energy, you simply may need to tune out your mother (easier said than done, I realize). As a pediatrician, I see the unnerving trend of childhood obesity played out in my office day after day, and I've learned that healthy eating habits need to start very early. Breastfeeding can help. Experts think breastfed babies regulate their food intake to their hunger better than bottle-fed babies; there's no ""Come on, baby, finish your bottle"" phenomenon. Keep the same thing in mind for toddlers and older kids. If they don't want to clean their plate, fine. Let your child listen to her body. It can make a big difference in the prevention of overeating later on. As the one who introduces food to your child, you have a never-again opportunity to put your own ""spin"" on healthy foods. If you present fruits and vegetables as treats, your child will grow up thinking they are. If you don't have soda or potato chips in the house, your child won't get a taste for them. If you introduce skim milk early (but not before age 2--growing brains need the fat until then), your child will think that skim is how milk should taste. My husband and I did that, and whenever Michaela was offered whole milk, she'd ask to have it watered down! Remember, too, that no matter what we say, it's what we do that our kids really watch. If you have a healthy diet, chances are much better that your child will too. Feeding himself--minus the mess? Q. My 15-month-old won't let me feed him--but when he feeds himself most of it ends up all over the place. What can I do? A.  There's only one solution: Get a dropcloth! An old shower curtain or vinyl tablecloth, or even a large towel, will do the trick. (Dogs work well too.) What your son is doing is developmentally appropriate; he should be congratulated for his initiative. This stage is messy (I have a stash of photos I plan to whip out at four wedding-rehearsal dinners), but it's fun. My kids were hilarious as they dove into their food--sometimes literally--and it was great to see the pride on their faces when they actually managed to spear that pesky bit of pasta with a fork or get that spoon to their mouth while it still had corn in it. Keep your child in a high chair rather than at the table--finger painting with tomato sauce is better done there, since you can hose it down later. There's something about bowls and plates, too, that invites throwing them to the floor. Putting food right on the tray may be best until the Gravity Game becomes less interesting. Don't give your child a lot at once. And don't worry about him eating enough. He'll let you know if he's still hungry. There will indeed come a day when you aren't down on the floor wondering if anything at all got into your child's mouth."

 New Thoughts on Nausea,http://www.parenting.com/article/new-thoughts-on-nausea,"It isn't easy being green, especially for the nearly three-quarters of all newly pregnant women who experience nausea during  pregnancy . And despite its name, ""morning sickness"" can strike at any time. Pregnancy nausea usually begins between four and eight weeks of pregnancy. There's no one explanation for what causes it, says Jennifer Niebyl, M.D., professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City. Researchers currently suspect a variety of factors including levels of pregnancy hormones such as human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), certain gastrointestinal bacteria like  H. pylori,  and vitamin deficiency (particularly vitamin B6). ""The hormone hCG plays a fundamental role in morning sickness,"" says Dr. Niebyl. ""If you're carrying multiples, you'll experience more nausea because of increased hCG levels."" Other factors include family history, predisposition to nausea (if you get car sick), and age (the younger you are, the greater the chances you'll be sick). The good news is that morning sickness is associated with having a healthy baby. While good news alone won't get rid of your nausea, the following remedies might help: ? Avoid triggers,  such as offensive odors and fatty, spicy foods. Increasing your protein intake may also help curb queasiness. ? Eat frequent small, bland meals and drink plenty of water and fluids between them.  Avoid an empty stomach -- and keep those crackers by your bedside. ? Talk to your practitioner about increasing your intake of vitamin B6,  which may lessen nausea, or ask about a new prenatal vitamin called PremesisRx that has a greater amount of vitamin B6 combined with folic acid and calcium carbonate. (It doesn't include iron, which can upset the stomach.) ? Ask your doctor about medication  such as vitamin B6 taken with the antihistamine Unisom Sleep Aid Tablets. This combination, formally sold as Bendectin, has been shown to be safe during pregnancy and is very effective at reducing morning sickness symptoms, says Dr. Niebyl. ? Try alternative techniques.  Relief Bands (which emit a gentle electrical current) or elastic motion-sickness bands worn on wrist acupressure points may provide some relief. And a new study has found that acupuncture may help reduce nausea. ? Add ginger to your diet,  as it's been shown to stave off nausea. Grate some into your tea, sip ginger ale made with real ginger, or snack on ginger cookies or candied ginger. Some other options are hard candies such as Gin-Gins or Preggie Pop lollipops and drops. And hang in there: Most women start to feel better in the second trimester."
 DEET-Free Mosquito Repellent Don't Bite Me! Patch Review,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/ganda-parentingcom/deet-free-mosquito-repellent-dont-bite-me-patch-review,"Have a kid who is a mosquito magnet? I understand, believe me. A single infected bite from a bloodsucking insect can easily grow into the size of a bar of soap on my skin, the lump growing hot, hard and purple. When I was six years old, Itraveled toThailand, my parents' home country. It wasmonsoon season over there. I got bitten by swarms of tropical mosquitoes and had to be hospitalized because my body's reaction was so severe. If there is a mosquito in the neighborhood, it will find me. In the summer, I rarely go out into nature without slathering myself in DEET spray. The  AAP  recommends choosing  insect repellents with 30% DEET  if used on children over six months in age -- but they should be used sparingly, and not at all on infants under two months. Still, who wants to spray the kids with chemicalsbefore an early morning walk or an outdoor concert at dusk, when skeeters are most likely to feed? That's why these  Don't Bite Me! patches  may just be changing my life.Eachone isa clear, 3""x3"" patch that you peel and stick onto your body -- they recommend the hip, the rear, the shoulder or the back.The stickerworks by delivering a dose of  thiamine, or Vitamin B1,  into your skin, which is then absorbed by the body and secreted out. This secretion forms a smell barrier which masks the human odor that is so attractive to biting insects. You apply them two hours before you go outdoors. Once applied, the waterproof patch offers protection from biters for up to 36 hours, according to the package. Before you scoff, you should know that I couldn't have been more skeptical. Nothing has worked for me except DEET-based sprays andclothing my bodyfrom head-to-toe, even on the hottest days of summer. But I went to two backyard barbecueslast weekend  without getting my bare arms bitten,  even though my friends were getting attacked by bloodsuckers. Miraculous! The real test comes this weekend, when I try to wear shorts at my friend's woodsy house in upstate New York. Worried about the high dosage of vitamin B1? I asked our Mom Squad pediatrician,  Dr. Lara Zibners , for the scoop. She hasn't tried them and can't vouch for them personally, but said, "" They are absolutely safe if the most toxic thing is vitamin B1 (Thiamine).  Thiamine is one of the water-soluble vitamins that are essential to our health. The difference between water-soluble vitamins (C, B1) and fat soluble (D, A, E) is that the body doesn't store them and  you usually pee out any excess ."" PROS: It worked!  For me, anyway. It's  waterproof  -- I showered with it, twice, with no apparent loss of efficacy. Great for kids who want to stay bite-free at the camp swimming hole. No DEET . Protects the entire body  while only touching one small square of skin. CONS: The website claims that the B1 secretion is not detectable by humans, but I could definitely smell the thiamine coming off me. It wasn't too bad -- the smell is strongest right where the patch is, and it's like  the whiff you get when you take the cap off of a bottle of vitamins . Not very off-putting, but not the kind of smell you want emanating if you're, say, sitting in a small car with three friends with sensitive noses. The site where I placed the patch on  my skinwas a tiny bit irritated , probably from the very strong adhesive used to keep it on the body. You might want to test an invisible area (like the back or hip) on a kiddo withsensitive skin. At $4.99 for5 patches, which willlast youabout 7-8 days,  it's not as cheap  as spray repellent. If you want to try the patch, the website is offering  a free sample  on their  Contact Us  page. Keep in mind that the patch is  not recommended for children under 2 years of age, nor has it been approved for pregnant or breastfeeding women . From their  FAQs : ""It seems to be especially effective for those people with large allergic reactions to bites...We find that the patch works for about 8 out of 10 people who use the product."" Let us know ifthey workfor you and your kids! UPDATE:  Went up to the country this weekend -- once again, the patch worked! It also worked for my friend who is, like me, a total mosquito magnet. No bites -- even after we had dinner outdoors at dusk. Maybe now I can go stay with people near the woods without bringing my mosquito net."

 The Food You Crave,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-food-you-crave,"Maple-Mustard Chicken Thighs The grainy mustard and maple syrup form a delectable tangy-sweet crust on these juicy chicken thighs. This recipe may have a small ingredient list, but it has really big flavor! * 8 bone-in chicken thighs (about 2 1/2 lbs), skin removed  * 1/3 cup grainy French mustard * 1 clove garlic, minced (about 1 tsp) * 3/4 tsp dried marjoram * 3 Tbs pure maple syrup Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F.

 On Call: Little Bowlegs,http://www.parenting.com/article/on-call-little-bowlegs,"Q. My  toddler  is clearly bowlegged. Is something wrong? A.  Most toddlers look at least a little bowlegged, which is totally normal. Babies are born with curved legs because the angle between the bones helped them fold up compactly in the womb. Between 18 months and 3 years, children's legs usually straighten out on their own.That said, bowlegged kids should be checked out by their doctor just to be sure they don't have a serious condition, such as Blount's disease (a problem with the tibia, one of the bones in the shin) or rickets (a disease caused by vitamin D deficiency, which can make bones weak). You should also call the doctor if your child seems to be getting more bowlegged or if he seems to be in pain when he walks."
 Preeclampsia: The Best Ways to Fight a Serious Condition,http://www.parenting.com/article/preeclampsia-the-best-ways-to-fight-a-serious-condition,"Last year about 300,000 women were treated for preeclampsia -- a pregnancy-induced condition characterized by high blood pressure that usually occurs in the third trimester. Because it causes the blood vessels to narrow, the condition can restrict blood flow to the placenta, kidneys, and liver. Most women don't have symptoms, but those who do may experience swelling, headaches, and sudden weight gain (more than five pounds in a week). It's not known what causes preeclampsia, but if you've had it before, there's a 20 percent chance you'll get it again. Women who already have high blood pressure, or who have diabetes or lupus, are also more likely to develop the condition, as are moms-to-be over 35 and those carrying multiples. While there's no guaranteed way to prevent the disease, here's what to keep in mind: Take care of yourself.  Eat right, exercise (even if it's a short daily walk), and take your prenatal vitamin -- all steps for staying healthy. Don't put off appointments.  Checks for high blood pressure, extreme weight gain, and protein in your urine can help with early detection. Ask your doctor about taking vitamins C and E.  Studies have found that these antioxidants may reduce your risk. Consider aspirin.  Check with your ob: A low dose taken daily may benefit some women in high-risk groups. If you do develop preeclampsia, you'll be monitored and your doctor will probably induce labor."
 Boning Up on Calcium,http://www.parenting.com/article/boning-up-on-calcium,"Why do you need 1,200 milligrams (mg) of  calcium  a day? It builds your baby-to-be's teeth and bones, and it may benefit pregnant women with high blood pressure. Your prenatal vitamin will supply about 300 mg. If drinking three glasses of milk a day doesn't tempt you, here are some alternatives:  Disguise it. Add a tablespoon of chocolate syrup to milk, whip up a smoothie by blending in some fruit, or make a dairy-based chowder.  Find other sources. These foods are calcium-rich: pasteurized swiss cheese (one ounce contains 204 mg calcium); low-fat vanilla yogurt (one cup, 418 mg); canned salmon (3 oz, 181 mg); and cooked spinach (one cup, 245 mg). And many juices are fortified (300 mg).  Go lactose-free. For those who are lactose-intolerant: Try rice or soy milk, though look for brands that have been enriched with calcium and vitamin D. Aged hard cheeses, such as cheddar, swiss, gouda, and parmesan, have a low-lactose content, which makes them easier to digest."
 Up Your Child's Iron Intake,http://www.parenting.com/article/up-your-childs-iron-intake,"One in three kids under age 6 doesn't get enough iron, which is crucial for growth and for carrying oxygen in the blood. A lack of it can make your  child  tired, irritable, and unable to think clearly. Kids often fall short because they don't eat enough meat and dark-green leafy vegetables -- two big sources. And though breads, cereals, and other grains are usually fortified with iron, calcium can interfere with absorption in the body. If your child eats fortified cereal (the biggest source of iron for young kids) with milk, for instance, she won't absorb much of the iron.   To boost intake, from Jodi Citrin, president of Citrition, a nutrition counseling practice in New York City: Serve kid-friendly meat sources , such as turkey sandwiches, burgers, beef tacos, and pasta with meatballs. (Serve red meats at most twice a week.)   Have your child drink non-calcium-fortified OJ  with an iron-packed breakfast, since vitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Or serve vitamin-C rich strawberries or oranges afterward. While it's great to drink milk with meals , you might aim for at least one meal that's a good source of iron (consisting of meat and/or fortified grains), and serve water or 100 percent fruit juice instead. Serve snacks that are good sources  of iron: hummus (with pita for dipping), watermelon, raisins, and dry fortified cereal."
 Happy Meals,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-happy-diet,"Chronically cranky? Could be you're not eating enough. Regularly skipping -- or skimping on -- meals can mean you're not getting enough serotonin, a brain chemical that helps keep anger in check, suggests new research from the University of Cambridge, in England. Fortunately, you can eat your way calm. Serotonin needs the amino acid tryptophan (known as the turkey drug) to work, and it only comes from food. We asked the Nutrition Twins, Tammy Lakatos Shames and Lyssie Lakatos, for a day's worth of happy meals that pack the biggest mood-boost per bite. Each combo balances a healthy dose of tryptophan with carbs and protein to keep you satisfied -- and smiling. Breakfast:  Oatmeal and eggs. Their fiber and protein give you a long-lasting energy blast to start the day. Snack:  Banana and yogurt. Perk up with yogurt's mood-lifting vitamin D bonus.  Lunch:  Baked potato and cheddar cheese. This duo also offers B vitamins to soothe your stress. Snack:  Pistachios and prunes. Rev up with this protein-fiber powerhouse. Dinner:  Salmon and brown rice. The brain-boosting omega-3's and mood-stabilizing fiber help make this meal the ultimate happy fix.  ? Apricots ? Asparagus ? Broccoli ? Cauliflower ? Chicken ? Lentils ? Milk ? Mozzarella ? Pumpkin seeds ? Shrimp ? Soybeans ? Spinach ? Tuna"
 B Prepared!,http://www.parenting.com/article/b-prepared,"However, its also vital that women get enough before pregnancy, since its necessary for the very earliest stage of fetal development. The baby needs this nutrient to make the cells for his or her brain and bones, as well as organs and skin. The Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for folic acid for all women, except those who are pregnant, is 400 micrograms. Best dietary sources are leafy green vegetables (especially spinach), citrus fruits, nuts, legumes, and whole grains. Since getting the daily requirement of folic acid through your diet can be difficult, many women depend on a supplement or multivitamin for help."
 On Call: Fading Scars,http://www.parenting.com/article/on-call-fading-scars,"Q.My toddler fell and  hit his head  on our coffee  table . His stitches are now out, and there's a scar on his forehead. Is there anything I can do to make it less noticeable? A. Bumps and falls are an unavoidable part of childhood, so lots of kids end up with stitches at some point (my four older children have each had them at least once). There are treatments on the market, such as ones made from vitamin E or onion extract, that are purported to diminish scars; there is no good medical evidence that they work. (If vitamin E is used too early, it may make the scar worse.) Sunburn can make scars appear larger, so using sunscreen's a good idea. The next time your child gets stitches, make sure to keep the area clean and get them out on time. Apply a petroleum jelly-based ointment like Aquaphor during the first few weeks after the stitches are taken out. As your child grows older, there are other safe treatments (such as laser surgery) available if the scar's noticeable enough to bother him. Chances are, though, this won't be necessarymost scars fade by themselves over time."
,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/fertility-files/none-your-business,"My new ob-gyn said I could take an over-the-counter prenatal vitamin or she offered to give me a prescription for one. I opted for the prescription kind (they usually have a little more folic acid). And now that we'll be officially trying in a matter of days, I went to pick up the vitamins. I also picked up a  DHA supplement  (an omega-3 fatty acid that's been shown to boost brain development in babies). Yay  exciting stuff. This actually wasn't the first time I went to get prenatal vitamins, though. I bought some over-the-counter ones a few months ago, but that time I felt a little weird about buying them. I think because we were a few months away from trying to get pregnant, I felt kind of like a poser getting the prenatal vitamins. And the worst part was, the guy at the cash register at GNC didn't make it any easier. ""Are you pregnant?"" GNC guy asked as he looked at my purchase while ringing me up. ""No,"" I answered. Who asks that? To a stranger? ""I'm trying,"" I added. Why I divulged more information, I do not know. I guess I felt the need to explain to this guy  who I will never see again in my life  why I was buying prenatal vitamins when I wasn't pregnant. And that should've been the end of it. But it wasn't. ""Have you been trying for a long time or are you just starting?"" he asked. Yeah, GNC guy, I'm really going to share the particulars of my fertility and sex life with you. But then of course, I did. ""We're just starting,"" popped out of my mouth. Why couldn't I have just said I'd rather not talk about it? Clearly I had not worked out a game plan for how to answer questions about my pregnancy timetable (I'm still working on that, by the way). He smiled as he gave me my receipt. ""Good luck!"" he shouted, as I walked out the door. Awkward. GNC guy knows I'm having lots of sex with my husband. Even though this encounter weirded me out, and I was not at all interested in talking with GNC guy about my sex life (even if he was encouraging!), I have to admit, that's pretty much what I'm doing now on this blog. I'm talking to people I don't know about this very personal time. In fact, I'm reminded of this anew every time a co-worker asks me a question about the blog. It even sort of startles me when someone brings it up because it forces me to remember that I'm telling this intimate information to the world. Still, somehow it's different when I'm writing it down in this context. Because this blog isn't for the GNC guy or other passing strangers, it's for people like me  women who are trying to get pregnant (or who are thinking about getting pregnant). And I hope this will be a place where we can talk about how the process is going  a place where we can share our experiences, trade stories, vent when things aren't going well, and ultimately, feel hopeful. GNC guys need not apply."
 Ellie's Lemon-garlic Roast Turkey Breast + Roasted Rosemary Potatoes and Roasted Brussels Sprouts,http://www.parenting.com/article/ellies-lemon-garlic-roast-turkey-breast--roasted-rosemary-potatoes-and-roasted-brussels-sprouts,"The whole meal makes 8 Servings 4-inch slices turkey, 2 tablespoons sauce,  cup potatoes, and  cup brussels sprouts Lemon-garlic Roast Turkey Breast Fresh roasted turkey breast isn't something you think of making regularly, but it should be! It couldn't be simpler to cook and it gives enough juicy lean meat to feed a crowd or have fabulous leftovers for sandwiches and other dishes the next few days. - Ellie 1 tablespoon olive oil 2 tablespoons finely chopped 2 teaspoons finely grated lemon zest 1 teaspoon salt  teaspoon freshly ground black pepper 1 whole bone-in turkey breast, skin removed (about 6 pounds) 2 cups low-sodium chicken broth 4 small cloves garlic, peeled 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. In a small bowl, combine the oil, rosemary, lemon zest,  teaspoon of the salt, and  teaspoon of the pepper. Place the turkey into a medium-sized flame-proof roasting pan, breast side up, and rub the rosemary-lemon mixture onto the breast. Pour 1 cup of the broth into the dish and add the garlic and half of the lemon juice. Roast, uncovered, until the juices run clear when pierced, and a mean thermometer registers 165 degrees F, 1 to 1 hours. Transfer the turkey breast to a carving board and allow it to rest for 10 minutes before carving. While the turkey is resting, place the pan directly on top of the stove. And the remaining 1 cup of broth and cook over high heat until it comes to a boil, scraping up any browned bits and allowing them to dissolve in the broth and mashing the garlic cloves into the broth. Cook over high heat until the broth is reduced by roughly half, about 6 minutes. Stir in the remaining lemon juice and remaining  teaspoon each of salt and pepper. Carve the turkey and serve topped with the pan sauce. Serve along side potatoes and brussels sprouts. Roasted Rosemary Potatoes Crunchy and golden brown outside with a tender soft center, these rosemary-spiked potatoes are absolutely heavenly. And you hardly have to do a thing. - Ellie Makes 8 Servings:  cup  2 pounds red new potatoes, halved 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 teaspoons chopped fresh rosemary leaves, or  teaspoon dried  teaspoons salt Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F. Place the potatoes on a baking sheet and toss them with oil, rosemary, and salt. Roast until they are golden brown and crisp on the outside and softened and tender on the inside, about  hours. Roasted Brussels Sprouts I have turned around countless Brussels sprout naysayers with this simple dish. In the oven the humble vegetable is transformed. Its outer leaves crisp and its natural sugars caramelize the outside while the inside becomes yieldingly tender. Its flavor mellows to a delightfully nutty essence. I wish I could be there to see you face light up when you taste them. - Ellie Makes 8 Servings:  cup 2 pounds Brussels sprouts, halved 2 tablespoons olive oil  teaspon salt Preheat oven to 375 degrees F.

 Sun Safety Vocabulary,http://www.parenting.com/article/sun-safety-vocabulary,"Feel like you need a Ph.D. in beachology to understand what's printed on that bottle or tube? A quick SPF glossary: ""Broad Spectrum"" or ""UVA/UVB Protection""  These phrases mean that the sunscreen offers protection against UVA rays as well as UVB ones. Remember, the SPF rating only measures how well the product protects against UVB rays; UVA rays are harder to measure, so sun formulas don't carry ratings for them. But UVA rays can lead to wrinkles and other signs of aging, while they and UVB rays can cause skin cancer, so it's important that the sunscreen you choose protects against both (many do). ""Non-Stinging"" or ""Tear Free""  Both of these terms mean that the product won't sting your kid's eyes when he accidentally rubs them with lotioned-up hands. ""Waterproof""  This claim means the product will stay on wet skin longer than a non-waterproof formula would. So you and your kids will be protected while you're swimming. But you still need to reapply it generously every two hours and after swimming, toweling off (and after sweaty rounds of beach volleyball). ""Sunblock""  Though the use of the word ""block"" isn't regulated (no product can entirely block the sun's rays), it typically contains titanium dioxide or zinc oxide, found in special formulas designed for infants. ""With Protective Vitamins""  A phrase that means the sunscreen contains vitamin A and two different forms of vitamin E. All are anti-oxidants that can protect skin from damaging free radicals. They're nice to have, but not necessary. ""Quick and Even Coverage""  The product was specially formulated to go on smoothly and easily. ""Continuous protection""  Formulated to stay effective longer than traditional products, so there is less of a drop-off in protection as the time to reapply nears. Missed a Spot? Don't blow your cover: Families come to the beach wearing shirts, then take them off and forget to put SPF on their torsos. Other commonly missed areas: the tops of ears and feet; the backs of necks and hands; and the skin around the eyes, since parents are afraid of getting sunscreen in kids' peepers (look for a formula labeled ""tear free""). Finally, don't forget to use a lip balm with SPF 45."
 4 Food Label Claims Decoded,http://www.parenting.com/article/4-food-label-claims-decoded,"Is that soup or cereal really as healthy as it seems? Maybe not. How to read between the lines on packaging: Claim: ""0 grams trans fat!"" The facts: This doesn't mean that the fat the food does have is the healthy mono- or polyunsaturated kind. ""I've seen some that are loaded with an entire day's worth of bad saturated fat. It's misleading,"" says Michael Jacobson, Ph.D., executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition and food-safety advocacy group in Washington, DC. Claim: ""All natural!"" The facts: Sounds great, but look at the ingredient list. Some products with manufactured high-fructose corn syrup are still allowed to make this claim, even though it's essentially a high-calorie sweetener and preservative. Claim: ""Supports immunity in kids!"" The facts: This is a biggie because parents make the mental leap from ""supports immunity"" to ""prevents colds and flu."" And who wouldn't want to snap that up? ""You see this claim on cereals, juices, frozen veggies, and sugar-packed drink pouches. But there's nothing magical about that particular product versus another one. Any food with a decent amount of vitamins can say this -- despite whatever other processed garbage may be in it -- because the anti-oxidants in vitamins are, in fact, involved with immunity,"" Jacobson explains. And vitamins won't have any effect on kids' resistance to illness. Claim: ""Made with 100 percent fruit!"" The facts: Whatever the item, it's unlikely to be as good for your kid as an actual piece of fruit. And don't be bowled over by the ""100 percent"" part; it means very little if that ""real fruit"" comprises only 1 percent of the cereal bar. Check the ingredients. If fruit isn't one of the first few on the list, it probably has only a scant amount."
 Health News You Can Use,http://www.parenting.com/article/health-news-you-can-use,"1. Gum it up.  Chewing sugar-free gum may help people eat less, finds new research from the University of Rhode Island. Chewing gum in the morning led study participants to eat 68 fewer calories at lunch. Chomping gum before andafter eating resulted in burning up to 8 percent morecalories during the day. An added bonus: Gum chewers reported that they felt less tired and said doing tasks seemed easier. So go ahead and burst some bubbles to help battle the bulge. 2. Watch your sodas.  Drinking two or more artificially sweetened diet drinks a day can double your risk of rapid kidney decline later in life, according to a study of 3,000 women by Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston. 3.Give back.  If your back's more sore during winter months, it could be you're not getting enough vitamin D,reports a new clinical review in Pain Treatment Topics. One study looked at 360 patients with chronic back pain and found that all of them had low levels of the vitamin.After taking supplements for three months, 95 percent of the patients had improved symptoms. Most adults need at least 1,000 IU of vitamin D per day, but researchersbelieve people with chronic back pain may need twice that. Talk to your doctor to see if your aching back can benefit from extra D. Plus: A Quick Stress Soothing Tip: Morning tantrums, dinner-table battles, bedtime drama.

 Veggie Delight,http://www.parenting.com/article/veggie-delight,"An easy way to get  your child  to eat his vegetables: Roast them. It brings out their natural sweetness, says Joy Bauer, author of  The Idiot's Guide to Total Nutrition.  Plus, water-soluble vitamins don't leach out when cooked. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees, and cut an assortment of bell peppers, carrots, cauliflower, sweet potatoes, eggplant, and zucchini into roughly same-size pieces. Toss in a large bowl with olive oil (for every two cups of chopped veggies, use a tablespoon of oil) and a little salt and pepper. Arrange pieces on a baking sheet in a single layer. (Such vegetables as carrots and cauliflower take a little longer to cook than softer ones like eggplant or zucchini, so use separate sheets if you make them together.) Roast for 20 to 30 minutes, flipping vegetables over once or twice, until they're crisp and crunchy. If you like, sprinkle with tarragon or basil, or toss carrots and sweet potatoes with cinnamon or a drizzle of maple syrup."

The highest source of K:  kale,  followed by  spinach, broccoli, green-leaf lettuces, and parsley . Experts recommend about one cup a day -- raw or cooked -- so one serving of salad should do the trick. For more benefits, top it off with a drizzle of olive oil and some shredded cheddar cheese and wash it down with green tea, three other surprising sources of K.

 Tips for the Lactose Intolerant,http://www.parenting.com/article/tips-for-the-lactose-intolerant,"During pregnancy, it's critical that you get enough  calcium . Otherwise, your body will draw from the calcium stored in your bones to build your fetus' skeleton. Your prenatal vitamin will give you a head start by supplying 200 to 300 of the 1,000 mg of calcium a day that doctors recommend during pregnancy. If you're lactose intolerant, try milk treated with lactase (an enzyme that breaks down lactose so the body can absorb it easily). And because much of the lactose is removed from cheese when it's made, it provides an easily digestible calcium boost. Milk-loathers may enjoy chocolate milk -- a tablespoon of chocolate syrup adds just 50 calories -- as well as yogurt. Preparing such foods as mashed potatoes and pudding with dry milk, which has more than three times the calcium of regular milk, is another way to fool milk-shy taste buds."
 The Importance of Folic Acid,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-importance-of-folic-acid,"Even though every enriched grain product, from cereal to pita bread, now includes folic acid -- a crucial vitamin that prevents birth defects of the brain and spine -- a new study found that many women are still not getting enough. Why? A woman must consume adequate folate (the naturally occurring form in food) or folic acid during the first weeks of pregnancy -- before she knows she's going to have a baby. The study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that only 40 percent of Caucasian women get enough folic acid. The numbers are even lower -- 19 and 21 percent -- for African-Americans and Hispanics. ""Most nonpregnant women consume less than the recommended 400 micrograms a day,"" says Heather Carter Hamner, nutrition epidemiologist with the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. Since 49 percent of pregnancies are unplanned, doctors recommend that all women of childbearing age pop a daily multivitamin containing folic acid."

 On Call: Picky Drinkers,http://www.parenting.com/article/on-call-picky-drinkers,"Q. Why is it that my toddler drinks water and juice from a sippy cup with no problem, but milk only from a  bottle ? A.  I hear this question a lot, and I think it's a comfort and habit thing -- many children associate milk with the bottle and don't feel right drinking it any other way. Just keep offering her milk in her sippy cup, even if she doesn't actually drink a lot of it. Children don't need all that much milk by the time they're toddlers -- 16 ounces a day is fine. And if she has other sources of calcium and vitamin D in her diet, such as yogurt, cheese, or fortified cereals or orange juice, it's perfectly fine if here and there she drinks less milk. If you think it's a comfort issue, try snuggling with her while she drinks milk out of her sippy cup, and she'll be more inclined to use it."
 Kids Health QA: Keeping Kids Hydrated,http://www.parenting.com/article/keeping-kids-hydrated,"Q. Our kids are outside all day. They don't like to drink water, so how can we make sure they stay hydrated without overdoing it on the juice? Don't give up entirely on water, because it hydrates without adding extra calories. To make it more appealing, try:  Letting your kids pick out cool water bottles they can carry with them.  Serving it very cold (you can buy insulated water bottles).  Adding a little flavor. Spritz a bit of lemon juice in their bottles or water down their juice (as long as it's the 100 percent kind). You can buy them flavored water, too, although it would be better if they learned to like the real stuff instead of the kind filled with artificial sweetener. They can also quench their thirst -- and keep cool -- with ice pops. Make your own by mixing 100 percent juice with water. Or offer fruits with a high water content, like melons, peaches, and grapes; the vitamins and minerals are a bonus!"

 Decoding Food Labels,http://www.parenting.com/article/decoding-food-labels,"Food  advertising can make a product sound healthy, but it may be more hype than reliable information. ""Food labels are designed to sell food -- not to educate the consumer,"" says Jayne Hurley, senior nutritionist at the Center for Science in the Public Interest. ""It's important to read the 'Nutrition Facts' and the ingredients list carefully."" Some phrases to be wary of: ""Real fruit beverage"" doesn't mean the drink is 100 percent fruit juice. Even ""100 percent of the RDA of vitamin C"" doesn't mean that the vitamin C is coming from juice -- it could be a fortified drink. ""Punch"" and ""cocktail"" hint that a product doesn't measure up. ""Multigrain"" doesn't mean that a cereal or bread contains whole-grain flour, which is more nutritious than enriched-wheat or white flour. The food could have a mix of grains -- grains that may be processed and stripped of fiber. Look for whole grain, whole bran, or rolled oats. ""Cholesterol-free"" isn't low-calorie or low-fat. Chips, for example, are cholesterol-free, because cholesterol comes from animal -- not vegetable -- products. ""Reduced fat"" isn't fat-free. According to the FDA, a ""fat-free"" product has less than one-half gram of fat per serving; ""low-fat"" foods have three grams of fat or less; ""reduced fat"" cuts 25 percent of fat from the original food. ""Lean ground beef"" doesn't mean the beef is low in fat. Look for labels that say, ""contains no more than 5 percent fat"" or ""at least 95 percent fat-free."""
 5 Common SPF Mistakes,http://www.parenting.com/article/5-common-spf-mistakes,"1. Not Knowing Your Kid's Camp or School Policy Many places either won't reapply SPF or consider it a medication, meaning you need to send a note giving the okay. 2. Polishing Off Last Summer's Bottle We've all done this! But according to Elizabeth Hale, M.D., a clinical associate professor of dermatology at New York University, opened sunscreen can lose its potency -- especially over the course of 12 months -- and not provide the same protection. 3. Not Reapplying Often Enough ""If your kids are out all afternoon and you don't put more on, that 30 you used earlier in the day may really only protect like an 8 or a 6,"" says Dr. Hale. Reapply every two hours and as soon as they get out of the water, regardless of how long it's been. 4. Feeling the Need to Buy Multiple Bottles The formulations of kids' and adults' brands are often the same. ""Some child brands are made to be tear-free or less irritating, but if your kids don't have any sensitivities, it's okay to apply the same stuff you use,"" says Sheila Friedlander, M.D., a clinical professor of medicine and pediatrics at the University of California, San Diego. 5. Letting Your Child Go Without Any SPF -- At Least For a Little While ""There has been a lot of talk about having kids get some sun so their bodies will produce vitamin D,"" says Dr. Friedlander. (Last month, even  Parenting  suggested allowing a few minutes of sun sans SPF for this same reason.) ""But sun exposure is no longer thought of as the main way for children to get this vitamin. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends kids get it through food, like fortified milk, or a supplement -- so they're not putting their skin and health at risk."""
 Morning Sickness Drug Makes Comeback,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/leonora-desar/morning-sickness,"The only drug with FDA approval to treat morning sickness is slated to hit pharmacies this June. The medication is called Diclegis and is a new version of the older pill Bendectin, which was taken off the market in 1983. Bendectin was banned from pharmacy shelves when an Australian obstetrician researcher claimed that it caused birth defects, says Dr. Murray Feingold ,  the physician in chief of The Feingold Center for Children, medical editor of WBZ-TV and WBZ radio, and president of the Genesis Fund .  Later studies showed that the obstetrician falsified his reports, and that the medication was in fact safe. Plus: Moms Best Morning Sickness Remedies It certainly is a medication that should have been brought back years ago, Dr. Feingold tells  Parenting . com . Its such a sad thing that a great drug was taken off the market for the wrong reasons. The nausea and vomiting of morning sickness affects almost three-quarters of newly pregnant women and usually strikes between four and eight weeks of pregnancy. Jennifer Niebyl, M.D., professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Iowa, in Iowa City, says that theres no primary theory behind what triggers it. Researchers suspect that family history, vitamin deficiency, gastrointestinal bacteria, and pregnancy hormone levels might be some contributing culprits. Plus: How to Quell Morning Sickness If youre a mom who is already expecting, theres still hope. Dr. Joanne Stone, the Director of Maternal-Fetal Medicine and Professor of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Science at Mount Sinai Hospital, says that doctors have essentially used the same thing as Bendectin and Diclegis for years.

Cherries contain a compound called melatonin, which is naturally produced by the pineal gland in the brain and helps the body know when it's time to sleep and wake up. Chomping on a few tart cherries before bed can increase melatonin for a better night's sleep."
 Smart Moves for Nursing Moms,http://www.parenting.com/article/smart-moves-for-nursing-moms,"So many different things affect the quality and quantity of your breast  milk . Here's what you need to know, from Sue Tiller, a registered nurse and the author of  Breastfeeding 101: A Step-by-Step Guide to Successfully Nursing Your Baby : Medication Effect:  Most drugs pass through breast milk to some degree. What to do:  Follow directions for pain relievers like ibuprofen and acetaminophen, but avoid aspirin. Most OTC antihistamines/decongestants are safe but may lower milk production. If your supply decreases, drink lots of fluids and talk to your doctor about alternatives. Also, be sure to ask about the safety of any medication, including herbal supplements, you're taking. Exercise Effect:  Women who exercise strenuously may produce less milk. There may also be a slight increase in lactic acid in the milk, which can cause gas for some babies. What to do:  If you work out more than two hours daily, feed your baby beforehand and drink plenty of fluids.   Vegetarian diet Effect:  Infants breastfed by vegetarian moms may be lacking in vitamin B12, since meat, poultry, and seafood are big sources. What to do:  Get at least 2.8 micrograms (mcg) of vitamin B12 daily through a multivitamin or food. If you eat eggs and dairy foods regularly, you may be fine -- a cup of skim milk has 1 mcg, and one egg has .5 mcg.   Alcohol Effect:  Alcohol transfers to breast milk and changes its odor and taste. Two drinks a week can decrease your supply or make your baby sleepier. What to do:  It's best not to drink. If you do, limit yourself to an occasional glass of wine or beer after nursing.   Colds and flu Effect:  By the time you feel symptoms, your baby's probably already been exposed to the virus. What to do:  Keep nursing. Cold- and flu-fighting antibodies are given to your baby through your milk, so nursing can help stave off or lessen the illness."
 Nutritious Eating: Vegetarian Diets for Babies,http://www.parenting.com/article/nutritious-eating-vegetarian-diets-for-babies,"Q. Once a baby starts to eat solids, can she get what she needs from a vegetarian diet? A.  Yes, as long as she eats a wide variety of foods, says Susan McQuillan, a registered dietitian in New York City. If you decide to raise your child vegetarian, tell your pediatrician and ask about any special considerations, as well as vitamin and mineral supplements. Depending on the type of vegetarian diet you follow, some specific rules apply: STRICT VEGETARIANS , known as vegans, don't eat any animal products, including dairy foods and eggs. Babies under age 1 should be given soy-based formula (not soy milk) if they aren't breastfeeding. Once you introduce solids, at around 4 to 6 months, make sure your child gets enough iron, B12, calcium, and protein. Offer iron-enriched grains and cereals (serve them with citrus fruits or other vitamin C-rich foods to help with absorption). Try calcium- and B12-fortified, protein-rich soy products, such as finely chopped soy hot dogs and tofu. And prepare macaroni and cheese and soups with soy cheese and soy milk. At 7 months, your baby can start eating pureed beans, lentils, and split peas for protein. LACTO-VEGETARIANS  include dairy foods, but not eggs, in their diet. Daily calcium and protein requirements are easier to meet, but lacto-vegetarians still need extra protein, iron, and B12. LACTO-OVO VEGETARIANS  eat dairy products as well as eggs, another source of iron. Once your child begins to eat solids, seek out protein-, iron-, and B12-rich foods, but don't serve egg whites until after age 1 to avoid her developing an allergy to eggs."
 Pregnancy Nutrition Guide,http://www.parenting.com/article/pregnancy-nutrition-guide,"""Eating for two"" during pregnancy doesn't mean you should gorge on doughnuts and chips. It means what you eat affects the health of both you and baby. Maintaining proper nutrition during pregnancy can help keep you energized through all three trimesters, and it can give your growing baby the right combination of vitamins, minerals, and proteins to develop correctly. Eating a little junk food now and then will not harm you and your baby, but you don't want to get all of your daily calories from foods high in fat and low in nutrients. What to eat Fruits and veggies: When planning your meals and snacks, think fresh and colorful. Browse the produce section in your grocery store for inspiration. Fresh fruits and vegetables contain amino acids, minerals, vitamins, fiber, and enzymes to help keep your digestive system running smoothly. Try making fresh fruit smoothies in the morning for breakfast, or fill a plate with colorful veggies to dip into your favorite salad dressing as an afternoon snack. Nuts and seeds: Healthy fats and proteins can keep your brain sharp and help your baby's brain develop and grow. Eating nuts and seeds every day can nourish your body with vitamin E and omega fatty acids. Sprinkle hemp seeds or chopped walnuts over your oatmeal or yogurt to transform them into powerful fuel for your body. Try making your own granola bars using a variety of nuts, seeds, grains, and dried fruit. Lean proteins: Protein helps build muscle and keeps you strong through your pregnancy, but you don't want to eat a lot of fatty proteins that can cause unnecessary weight gain. Stick to lean proteins such as turkey breast, low-fat yogurt, and lean cuts of red meat such as filet mignon or tenderloin. Whole grains: Whole grains contain a lot of fiber that will help with digestion, and let's face it, sometimes you need all the help you can get during pregnancy! Eating more whole grains will give you energy and help your body absorb nutrients and amino acids. Try eating only minimally processed grains such as stone-ground oats, brown rice, and quinoa. Prenatal vitamins: Make sure to take a high-quality prenatal vitamin every day. If you have a high-risk pregnancy, talk to your OB/GYN or midwife about which prenatal vitamin they recommend and whether you should take any additional supplements. What to avoid According to the University of Nebraska ,avoiding the wrong foods can help you as much as eating the right foods. Processed foods: Processed foods contain refined sugars, artificial flavors, hydrogenated fats, and large amounts of salt that will leave your pregnant body feeling sick, bloated, and depleted. Salt can cause you to retain extra water weight and may promote the development of gestational diabetes and pre-eclampsia. Steer clear of processed meat products that contain high levels of nitrates, such as hot dogs and bologna. Fish, seafood, and raw meats: Most fish contain some level of methyl mercury, which can damage your baby's developing nervous system and brain. It's generally best to avoid eating fish during your pregnancy. If you do eat fish, stick to varieties that contain the lowest mercury levels, such as sardines and salmon, and make sure it is fully cooked. Raw meats and seafood can contain bacteria such as Listeria that can cause birth defects, miscarriage, and stillbirth. Avoid any type of raw sushi, steak tar tar or other under-cooked meat or seafood. Soft cheeses and raw dairy: Unpasteurized dairy can contain bacteria like Listeria that could causemiscarriageand stillbirth. Raw dairy and soft cheeses do not go through the pasteurization process, which kills off harmful bacteria. Avoid soft cheeses, such as brie or blue cheese, and select hard cheeses, such as parmesan and cheddar, to enjoy with your meals. Caffeinated drinks: Doctors can't seem to agree completely about caffeine. While too much caffeine can increase your risk of miscarriage or low birth weight for your baby, more doctors are agreeing that small consumption of caffeinated drinks, like coffee and black tea, won't hurt your growing baby as long as you limit your intake to 200 mg a day . Most suggest sticking with caffeine-free beverages such as herbal teas, juice, milk, and decaf coffee. Although they won't give you the pick-me-up you might enjoy, they will keep your baby safe from overstimulation. Alcohol: As with caffeine, medical advice regarding alcohol can vary.Somedoctors say occasional small amounts of alcohol , such as a glass of red wine or a sip of champagne, are unlikely to harm your baby during pregnancy. Others caution that there is no known safe amount. Researchers at Arizona State University note that alcohol can be more harmful to the baby during the early stages of development and that heavy drinking can cause irreversible damage including birth defects, low birth weight, and Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Timing is everything Throughout your pregnancy, morning sickness and heartburn can make you feel miserable and affect your eating habits. Luckily, eating meals and snacks more frequently can help keep tummy woes at bay. Instead of eating three large meals per day, try eating six to eight small meals per day. Aim to eat something about every four hours throughout the day."

 6 Food Myths That Are Making Kids Fat,http://www.parenting.com/toddler/feeding-nutrition/6-food-myths-are-making-kids-fat,"According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,  obesity rates in children  are twice what they were 30 years ago. Many parents are unsure why their children are seemingly unable to stop gaining weight. As a childhood obesity expert and Medical Director of  Gramercy Pediatrics , I know severalcommon food myths are making kids fat. There's a lot of confusion surrounding healthy food choices.A stroll down almost any supermarket aisle in the country, and customers will find products that advertise healthy ingredients, when in reality they can lead to weight gain in children. It can be confusingto decipher what the healthiest food options truly are.I suggest looking out for these hazardous eating myths when trying to  make healthier choices for your children : Myth 1: Foods Labeled ""Diet,"" ""Gluten Free,"" and ""Organic"" are Healthy Choices Food trends and product labels can mislead you into believing you're eating a healthy diet. When deciding what to feed growing children, it's important to look at foods as a whole.Look at things like sodium, artificial sweeteners, nutritional value, and calories. All of these play a role in determining if a food item is healthy or not. Sodium can lead to high blood pressure, even in children.  Lowering sodium is especially important for children  who are overweight in order to lower their risk for heart disease in the future. You should also look out for artificial sweeteners, which can make children want to eat more food, consequently consuming more calories than they otherwise would. Additionally, growing children need certain nutrients from their food. A slightly higher calorie meal might be a healthier option if it's providing significant amounts of vitamin A, vitamin B, vitamin C, vitamin D, iron, and/or calcium. Myth 2: Juice is a Healthy Drink for Kids Many parents believe that since fruit is healthy, fruit juice is great for their children. However, this  high-calorie sugary beverage  could be contributing to weight gain. Some argue that the drinks have great nutritional value because they can be rich in vitamins, but you're better off giving your child fresh fruit to eat, which also contains fiber that is lost in the juicing process. The excess calories from juice also fill children up so that they don't want to eat the solid foods that have fiber, protein, and healthy fats. Myth 3: Cereal is a Great Way for Children to Start the Day Cereal is an easy and tasty breakfast option for kids rushing to make the school bus. But beware, most child marketed cereal options contain more sugar than the standard dessert. Cereal can be tricky;  misleading labels often advertise healthy ingredients , vitamins, and whole grains. But these boasted benefits can be outweighed by the sugar quantity. The excessive glucose can lead to a rapid increase in blood sugar as well as an increase in calorie consumption. I recommendreading food labels carefully to replace sugary cereals with healthier options. You need to keep a sharp eye out for sneaky sugar terms that may appear on boxes, such as organic molasses, bee honey, and organic sugar cane, which fool parents into believing that they're healthy cereals. Better breakfast options, like fruit, low-fat yogurt, eggs, and oatmeal, give kids the energy they need without packing on the pounds. Myth 4: Whole Wheat Bread is Healthy Bread There are fewer differences between white bread and whole wheat bread than most people believe.They both have high levels of glucose that are broken down into the bloodstream the same way. This not only causes weight gain but can lead to a more serious health problem, such as diabetes. If a package is labeled as whole wheat, it doesn't mean it contains the healthy grains children need. Processed whole wheat bread is almost entirely stripped of fiber. Be careful when reading bread labels and look for packages that read 100 percent whole grains. These healthier alternatives have been shown to allow for more balanced  glucose level in children . Myth 5: Frozen Yogurt is a Healthy Dessert Option Frozen yogurt can be a healthier alternative to most ice creams, but that doesn't mean that it's the best option. Although most frozen yogurt is low-fat, it still contains more calories than most people imagine. A large cup of standard frozen yogurt is around 380 calories with 76 grams of sugar, not including toppings. Most kids prefer their flavored frozen yogurt with sugary toppings, which can be just as fattening as ice cream. Adding sprinkles, candy, and artificial syrups leads to potentially harmful levels of sugar. Instead, serve kidsplain low-fat frozen yogurt with fruit. The fruit will sweeten up the yogurt without adding unnecessary, harmful sugars. Also, make sure to keep the portion sizes small to lessen the buildup of calories. Myth 6: Veggie Chips are a Healthy Alternative to Potato Chips This sneaky snack often contains the same number of calories as potato chips and can have the same weight gaining effects, too. The small serving of vegetables found in veggie chips are countered by the high amounts of potato and corn flour. The vital nutrients that vegetables contain are lost in the process when veggie chips are manufactured. Try cutting out the processed potato altogether and making healthy vegetable snacks at home. Kale baked with a small amount of olive oil and salt is crispy like a potato chip, without having the same unhealthy ingredients that can compromise children's health and weight.

 Study: Medications Are Leading Cause of Accidental Child Poisoning Deaths,http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/caitlin-parentingcom/study-medications-are-leading-cause-accidental-child-poison,"Whens the last time you gave serious thought to whats in your medicine cabinet and how accessible it might be to pint-sized explorers? Currently more children are brought to emergency rooms for medication poisonings than for car accident injuries. Today  Safe Kids Worldwide  released a new research report,  Safe Storage, Safe Dosing, Safe Kids  that shows that while the child death rate from poisoning overall has decreased, the percentage of deaths due to medications has almost doubled since the late 1970s. PLUS: Parenting's Printable Health and Safety Guides The study  researched the history of unintentional medication overdoses among children ages 14 and under. Among young children, a child ingesting medication while unsupervised causes a whopping  95 percent  of medication-related poisoning visits to emergency departments; approximately five percent are due to dosing errors made by caregivers. Plus: New Dosing Info for Infants Acetaminophen Researchers attribute this dangerous and growing trend to the fast pace of todays lifestyle. More medications than ever are in the home (everything from prescription pain medication to dietary supplements and vitamins), and many parents, grandparents, and caregivers alike may be too distracted to immediately put medicines away in an out-of-reach and locked place. The study also pointed to the rise in multigenerational households where children may now have greater access to grandparents medicationsand 20 percent of pediatric poisonings involve a grandparents medication. PLUS: Guide to Stocking Your Medicine Cabinet All of this adds up to the fact that medications are the leading cause of child poisoning today. About 165 kidsor roughly four school busloads of childrenare seen in emergency rooms for medication-related treatment every day in the U.S., said Kate Carr, President and CEO of Safe Kids Worldwide, in a press release. Every one of those trips was preventable.We can and must do better. Follow these  safety tips from Safe Kids Worldwide  to prevent your child from accidentally overdosing or ingesting dangerous medications: Always put medicines and vitamins away after every use.Never leave them on the counter between dosings. Dont be tempted to keep them handy in a purse, backpack, or briefcase, or in an unlocked cabinet or a drawer within a childs reach.  Always read and follow label instructions when giving medicines to children. Only use the dosing device that comes with the medication. Never use a household utensil, such as a teaspoon or tablespoon, to measure medication. Buy child-resistant packages when available and securely close them every time. Remind babysitters, houseguests, and visitors to keep purses and bags that contain medicine up and away when they visit your home. Wait the appropriate period of time between doses. Dont increase the dosage because your child seems sicker. Never give adult medications to children. Never refer to medicine as candy or tell children it tastes like candy. Program the nationwide poison control center number (1-800-222-1222) into your phones. Has your child ever gained access to vitamins or medicine when he shouldnt have? What happened?"
 Parents Cleared of Child Abuse after Baby's Disorder Is Discovered,http://www.parenting.com/news-break/parents-cleared-child-abuse-after-babys-disorder-discovered,"The Short of It Jacksonville, Fla., parents were cleared of child abuse charges after their baby's metabolic bone disorder was discovered and explained her multiple fractures. The Lowdown In June 2014, Brooke Bornhorst and Will Meade noticed their 7-week old daughter wasn't moving her arm, so they promptly took her to the hospital,  where an X-ray revealed a broken humerus . Puzzled, a full body X-ray followed and even more unexplained broken bones were discovered. The parentswho couldn't provide an explanationwere taken from the hospital in handcuffs and subsequently  charged with felony child abuse , while their three children were removed from their home and placed on a fast track to adoption. ""The unexplained fractures are stand-alone  evidence of physical abuse ,"" the state Department of Children and Families concluded at the time. ""That's when the world just fell,"" Bornhorst told First Coast News. "" We wanted help. No one helped us . They didn't ask me about my pregnancy. No medical history. Nothing."" So after she bonded out of jail, Bornhorst took matters into her own hands and began digging for answers. An unusual set of labs led her to discover that her baby has a metabolic bone disorder called Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and vitamin D deficiency. Symptoms include double-jointedness, easy bruising, and yes, bone fragility. And it turns out, Bornhorst has it, too. Dr. Michael Holick, a researcher at Boston University Medical Center, director of the Bone Health Care Clinic at Boston Medical Center, and an expert on Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome and vitamin D deficiency, testified at Bornhorst and Meade's trials. ""For me,  that case was pretty cut and dried ,"" he told First Coast News. ""The problem is the radiologists and even these child abuse experts, they do not have the expertise in metabolic bone disease, so they don't appreciate the subtletieswhat it can do to the skeleton, or vitamin D deficiency. They just see lots of fractures, and they've been taught lots of fractures is obviously child abuse, end of story."" The Upshot While the case undoubtedly represents a victory for Bornhorst and Meade, it is not one without cost. The couple's mug shots appeared on local TV and they were raked over the coals on social media, with commenters calling for them to be jailed, tortured and executed. And even worse, the time they spent away from their three children is time they can never get back. The criminal charges were dropped in a matter of weeks, but it wasn't until this September that full custody of the children was returned to themwithout any future supervision by the state. "" We lost 476 days with our babies at home ,"" Brooke said. ""It's just a horrible injustice.""

 Your Pregnancy: Week 5,http://www.parenting.com/article/your-pregnancy-week-5,"Your Baby It's only been a week since your embryo, about the size of an apple seed, attached to the wall of your uterus, but already it has made many developmental leaps. The placenta and the umbilical cord are functioning, passing oxygen and  nutrients  between you and your baby. The cluster of cells that will become your baby's heart -- a mere speck right now -- has already formed, and the brain and spinal cord are beginning to take shape. Your Body A home pregnancy test will confirm what you may already suspect--you're pregnant! Other than that things are pretty much the same on the outside, and you don't look any different than you did a few weeks ago. Growing a baby is exhausting work, however, and you may feel a little more fatigued than usual. Most initial prenatal checkups take place between six and ten weeks, so make an appointment if you haven't already. Do's and Don'ts Do take a pass on that glass of wine with dinner. While some experts say the occasional drink won't likely cause a problem, why take a chance? If you're concerned about having indulged recently, you're probably in the clear. Although fetal development is crucial in the first trimester, there's no need to worry if you had a few drinks in the first few days of pregnancy, especially before the embryo was implanted in the womb. Health If you aren't already taking them, now's the time to start on prenatal vitamins. Even if you regularly eat a diet rich in vitamins and minerals, you could be missing some of the biggies, including folic acid, calcium, and iron. Folic acid, a B vitamin, helps prevent neural tube defects and reduces the chances of a preterm delivery; iron plays a key role in the production of red blood cells that carry oxygen in the blood; and calcium builds your baby's bones and teeth. Mom to Mom Good news from a home pregnancy test? Find a creative way to tell your partner that a baby's on the way. ""I set an extra place at the table using a baby dish and spoon set.""--Ruth Gross, Warren, MI Shopping It'll be a few more months before you'll need maternity clothes, but you may be able to snag a few deals now by shopping end-of-season sales at maternity shops and online stores. Resist the urge to splurge, however (although it's understandable considering how exciting it is to be pregnant). You may need to try on certain items such as skirts and pants to find the best fit, which you can't do until you are showing. Exercise If you weren't in shape before you conceived but want to start exercising, first get the green light from your doctor or midwife. Exercise boosts your flagging energy levels, a plus during the first trimester when, like many women, you may tire easily. It also strengthens your body to meet the physical demands of pregnancy. Begin slowly with short walks or sign up for a prenatal exercise class, where an instructor can guide you down the road to fitness. Relationships Don't know whether to wait or share your baby news right away? It's considered good form to wait until the end of the first trimester when you know the pregnancy is viable. But doctors say once they have detected a heartbeat, you can feel free to tell those closest to you. Siblings Already have an older child? That may have some effect on the personality of your new baby. Later-borns are more likely to become artists, inventors, or rebels. They're probably more adventurous and less conventional, since they're often forced as kids to explore new territory in order to compete with older siblings. Twins Want a crash course in how to cope with twins? Learn this crucial tenet and repeat it out loud: Everyone who wants to help gets to do so! Many people will offer to babysit during those early days. Take them all up on it -- and keep your helpers rotating so they don't get overworked."
 Your Pregnancy: Week 21,http://www.parenting.com/article/your-pregnancy-week-21,"Your Baby Your baby  now measures about seven inches from head to rump and weighs about 10 1/2 ounces. Now that his digestive system is fairly sophisticated, your little one can swallow  amniotic fluid , which makes for a surprisingly nutritious drink that helps fatten him up. The act of swallowing also preps his digestive system for the hard work it will do once he's born. He can taste what he ingests, thanks to taste buds that have developed on his tongue. Nerve cells are working overtime to make connections, and development continues its brisk pace for the five senses. Your Body Your  uterus  continues to rise, taking its place about a half inch above the belly button this week. You're probably feeling pretty good, at least compared to the turbulent first  trimester . The nausea has gone away, the bathroom breaks are less frequent, and you're probably feeling more energetic than you have in a long while. Do's and Don'ts Do bring a CD or MP3 player the next time you have to give blood (the glucose screening test is coming up). When it's your turn, put on the headphones and enjoy the music as you imagine yourself lazing on a beach under a warm sun. Calming tunes work best, or relaxing sounds such as ocean waves lapping or birds chirping. Health Still feeling queasy well into the second trimester? Talk to your health practitioner about increasing your intake of vitamin B6, to help ease nausea, or ask about a new prenatal vitamin called PremesisRx that has a greater amount of vitamin B6 combined with  folic acid  and calcium carbonate. (It doesn't include iron, which can upset the stomach, but your doctor can advise you on food sources that will supply iron.) Mom to Mom Your vivid dreams may astonish you. ""In my dream, it was right after my baby shower. I walked to the crib to look again at all the gifts I'd stashed there. To my surprise, I saw that I'd already given birth--to kittens.""--Terry Bain, Rockville Centre, NY Shopping Attending a wedding or some other formal event and don't want to spend a lot on a one-time outfit? Head to independent maternity shops; many of them rent evening wear for such occasions. Exercise Sip water or sports drinks (like Gatorade) every 15 to 20 minutes during your workouts to replace liquids you lose through sweating. The color of your urine is a fairly accurate indicator of how hydrated you are: If it's clear or pale yellow, you're fine; if it's darker, drink up. Relationships You're halfway through the pregnancy and your libido is in overdrive, but sex isn't comfortable because of your growing belly. Try staying on top, which prevents your tummy from getting jostled and takes the pressure off your abdomen. Another position to try is spooning: both of you on your side with him cradling you from behind. Siblings Sign up your child now for a sibling prep course, where she'll be able to talk about her feelings and learn how to be a great big sister. Sessions usually last for a few hours and may even include a tour of a maternity-ward nursery. Twins Instead of buying two of everything, save the doubles for crucial equipment like strollers and car seats. You won't have to make room for needless extra stuff."
