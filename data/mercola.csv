Appendicitis During Pregnancy,http://articles.mercola.com/appendicitis/pregnancy.aspx,"Women are particularly more sensitive when they are expecting, as their body goes through many hormonal and physical changes. Certain types of pain are common during this period, particularly abdominal pain.    This is usually normal and is brought on by the expanding uterus, stretching of the ligaments and shifting of the organs. But in some cases, abdominal pain during pregnancy is brought on by certain health conditions  appendicitis is one of them.    Remember that having appendicitis while pregnant can be particularly dangerous both for you and your baby. This is why you should be on the lookout for this ailment and seek help immediately if you feel the symptoms of this ailment.    Incidence of Appendicitis in Pregnant Women  During pregnancy, appendicitis is the most common and non-obstetric emergency that may entail surgery. Its not a rare disorder and is seen in approximately 1 out of 1,500 pregnancies.1  It commonly happens during the second or third trimester, although it may also occur during the first trimester.    The appendicitis incidence rates range from 19 to 36 percent during the first trimester, 27 to 60 percent during the second trimester and 15 to 33 percent during the last three months of pregnancy.2   The incidence of appendicitis in women, is the same whether they are pregnant or not. However, pregnancy increases the risk of perforation.3   Whats alarming is that expectant mothers who have gone through an appendectomy are at a higher risk of fetal loss,4 especially if this condition occurs during early pregnancy and if the mother fails to receive appropriate medical attention immediately.5   Premature contractions and early labor may also be prompted by appendicitis, especially during the third trimester.6  This Condition May Be Mistaken as a Sign of Labor  The problem with accurately diagnosing appendicitis if youre pregnant is that the signs and symptoms are typically similar to those of pregnancy or the onset of labor. Aside from pain in the lower right abdomen, the most common symptoms include:7    Loss of appetite (anorexia)  Nausea  Vomiting   Fever and diarrhea are not common, although uterine contractions and painful or difficult urination (dysuria) may be felt. In some cases, the pain may be in the upper instead of lower right belly, because the appendix changes position during pregnancy.8  Appendicitis During This Delicate Period Must Be Addressed Immediately  If youre pregnant and are experiencing any of the symptoms above, have yourself (and your baby) checked immediately. If not diagnosed and treated promptly, appendicitis can lead to potentially dangerous side effects. This includes complications such as preterm labor, infection and risk of fetal or maternal loss. There is very low risk of the mother dying from appendicitis, though, with less than 2 percent succumbing to this illness. However, your infants health may be in jeopardy.    Those at a higher gestational age have a higher risk of perforation. If the appendix bursts during the third trimester, preterm labor might happen, and if no surgical intervention is done, the risk of fetal loss rises. The first week after the surgery is the riskiest, as it may lead to premature delivery  both the mother and unborn child should be closely monitored during this period.9  Previous Appendicitis in Children Next Appendicitis Duration   Previous Appendicitis in Children   Next Appendicitis Duration [+] Sources and References      1,6American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, May 2000;182(5):1027-92,7,9The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, 2006;19(6):621-6263,4Motherisk, Appendicitis during pregnancy, March 20045Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica, Oct 1999;78(9):758-628Everyday Health, Symptoms of Appendicitis, July 22, 2014"
Is Acetaminophen Safe During Pregnancy?,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/08/31/acetaminophen-during-pregnancy.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola Acetaminophen,  also known as paracetamol (International Nonproprietary Name),1 may be one of the more dangerous drugs you can purchase. This may surprise you  since most households carry one or two variations of the product to treat  headaches, fever or cold symptoms. Acetaminophen  is classified as an analgesic, or a medication acting to relieve pain.  According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, analgesics are  the No. 1 reason people call a poison control center.2  The  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) links 980 deaths per year to  acetaminophen and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  determined that, beginning in 2006, the number of people who died after  accidentally taking too much acetaminophen exceeded the number who purposely  overdosed on acetaminophen.3 However,  these numbers may be deceiving, as other researchers have found 56,000  emergency room visits and 26,000 hospitalizations can be attributed to  acetaminophen.4  Although  frighteningly high for a drug most people routinely keep in their homes, this  isn't the only damage acetaminophen may cause.  A recent study published in the  Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Pediatrics has linked taking acetaminophen  during pregnancy with conduct disorders and hyperactivity in children.5 Acetaminophen  During Pregnancy Linked to Hyperactivity and Conduct Disorders The  objective of this British study was to examine the association between  behavioral problems in children and mothers who took acetaminophen during pregnancy  and/or during the postpartum months, or partners who took acetaminophen.6 The  researchers concluded: ""Children exposed to acetaminophen prenatally are at  increased risk of multiple behavioral difficulties.""7 The researchers did find that these results were not explained by social  factors or other behavioral challenges linked to increased use of  acetaminophen. As  compared to individuals who did not use acetaminophen during their pregnancy, those who took the  drug during weeks 18 and 32 had a 31 percent increased risk of hyperactivity  and a 42 percent higher relative risk of conduct disorders in their children.8 This  study controlled for a number of different variables that could have affected  the results, such as genetics, smoking and alcohol use.9 There were over 7,700 participants. Not  everyone was convinced by the results of the study. Even lead author,  epidemiologist Evie Stergiakouli, PH.D., of the University of Bristol, stepped around  the issue, saying:10  ""Observational associations do not necessarily mean  that there is a causal association between the risk factor and the health  outcome.""  However,  the researchers also noted (quoted from Medical News Today):11  ""Children exposed to acetaminophen use prenatally are  at increased risk of multiple behavioral difficulties  Given the widespread  use of acetaminophen among pregnant women, this can have important implications  on public health advice.""   Other Studies Confirm Results and Identify More  Risk While  recent, this is not the only study associating acetaminophen with dangerous side  effects to your health and the health of your children.    A  recent study from the Center for Research in Environmental Epidemiology (CERAL),  Barcelona, Spain, found a link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and hyperactivity and autism.12 Researchers discovered  more symptoms of autism in boys whose mothers took acetaminophen during  pregnancy, than in girls.  They found that all children exposed to acetaminophen  during pregnancy were 30 percent more likely by age 5 to demonstrate attention  impairments linked with hyperactivity disorder or autism.13  A  study found an association between the drug and children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).14  Children whose mothers  used acetaminophen during pregnancy were at higher risk for hyperkinetic  disorder, use of ADHD medications or having ADHD-like behavior by age 7. There  was a stronger association when mothers took the drug in more than one  trimester.  A  study published in 2009 found mothers who used acetaminophen in the third  trimester were at higher risk for preterm birth.15   A  study published in 2013 found children exposed to acetaminophen during  pregnancy developed motor skills, communication and language skills more slowly  than those children who were not exposed.16  Use  of acetaminophen during pregnancy also appears to be linked to pre-eclampsia  and thromboembolic diseases,17 and taking the drug for more than four weeks during pregnancy, especially  during the first and second trimester, moderately increases the risk of  undescended testicles in boys.18  Acetaminophen Use and Toxicity     In  this short video, CBS News explains the statistics and risks associated with acetaminophen  use. The drug works by blocking feelings of pain and reduces fever without addressing the  source of the issue. As your body metabolizes the drug, it may damage your  liver. In 2009 the FDA issued this warning:19  ""Liver warning: This product contains acetaminophen. Severe  liver damage may occur if you take more than 4,000 mg of acetaminophen in 24  hours; with other drugs containing acetaminophen [or three] or more alcoholic  drinks every day while using this product.""  In 2014, the FDA  updated their warning to include:20  ""FDA is recommending health care professionals discontinue  prescribing and dispensing prescription combination drug products that contain  more than 325 milligrams (mg) of acetaminophen per tablet, capsule or other  dosage unit.""  Unfortunately,  there are times you may be taking more acetaminophen than you realize as the  drug is a common addition to other pain and over-the-counter cold remedies.   Vicodin and Percocet are two common prescription pain medications that include  acetaminophen, increasing your risk of acetaminophen poisoning, one of the more  common forms of toxicity, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).21 Other  common brand name over-the-counter medications that include acetaminophen in  their active ingredients include:22     Actifed Alka Seltzer Plus Anacin Cepacol   Contac Coricidin Dayquil Dimetapp   Dristan Excedrin Feverall Formula 44   Liquiprin Midol Mucinex Nyquil   Panadol Robitussin Saint Joseph Aspirin-Free Singlet   Sinutab Sudafed Theraflu Triaminic   Vanquish Vicks   As  the drug is a common ingredient in other over-the-counter medications, and has  a narrow therapeutic index, it is easy to accidentally overdose or take enough  to cause significant liver  damage.23 Doses over 5,000 mg per day if you don't consume alcohol, and 4,000 mg if you  do consume alcohol, can trigger significant liver damage. There's 4,000 mg of  acetaminophen in just eight extra strength tablets. While  other countries have placed a limit on how much consumers may purchase and have  restricted sales to pharmacies, no such limits are placed in the U.S.24 From 2001 to 2010, the related deaths attributed to acetaminophen were twice that  of all other over-the-counter pain relievers combined. Number of Children With ADHD Rising In  both private insurance and Medicaid populations, the number of children being  treated with drugs for ADHD continues to rise. According to the CDC,  approximately 3 out of 4 children between age 2 and 5 receive medication for  ADHD, but only half of those receive any form of psychological services.25 In  2011, approximately 11 percent of children between the ages of 4 and 17 were  diagnosed with ADHD. This is a significant rise from 7.8 percent in 2003.26The rate of diagnosis of ADHD also varies by state  in the U.S., with the highest being Kentucky at 18.7 percent and the lowest being  Nevada at 5.6 percent. According  to the National Survey of Children's Health, the average age of diagnosis is  6.2 years; 3.5 million children are taking medication for treatment, and boys  continue to be twice as likely as girls to be diagnosed with ADHD.27   Medications  used to treat this hyperactivity disorder are stimulants, which come with their  own list of side effects and dangers. Common side effects include headaches,  upset stomach and increased blood pressure. Less commonly, children may  experience loss of appetite, weight loss, insomnia and tics.28 Natural Alternatives for Pain, Fever and  Anti-Inflammatory Treatment Although  the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) continues to recommend  acetaminophen for treatment of minor discomfort, fever and pain during  pregnancy,29 the choice is ultimately yours. It will be you, your child and your family who  experience the repercussions from using medication that may affect your child's  neurological development. There  are other choices for treatment. Dr. Aisling Murphy, assistant clinical  professor at University of California Los Angeles Obstetrics and Gynecology, admitted to  CNN:30  ""Minor aches and pains (e.g., headaches or mild  backache), are common in pregnancy and often are a reason for patients to take  acetaminophen. The practice is very common.""  However,  she also counsels her patients to use other methods first, and avoid any  unnecessary medication during pregnancy, including acetaminophen. These alternative  modalities may include:  Hot  or cold packs to the area may help reduce discomfort or pain. However, do not  use a sauna or hot tub as these raise your core temperature, increasing the  risk for miscarriage or some birth defects.31 Your headache or muscle aches may  respond well to massage to increase relaxation and improve blood flow to aching  muscles or joints. Ginger tea may help relieve  tension and sooth your aching head. However, not all herbal teas are safe  during pregnancy. Teas contain many of the same nutrients as foods, but in more  concentrated forms. Ginger tea may help relieve aching muscles, reduce insulin  resistance, ease morning sickness and relieve stress.32 Use fresh organic ginger root to steep your own tea at home and avoid the  potential of accidentally ingesting harmful additives. Essential oils are  another way to relax, unwind and reduce pain and discomfort. A favorite of some  midwives is Frankincense topically, in your bath water or as a scent in your  room.33,34 Getting  plenty of sleep may also help reduce your perception of discomfort and pain.  During pregnancy your body is working to develop a new human being. You require  more rest and sleep than you normally would. Lack of sleep may increase your  perception of pain and discomfort. If you have trouble falling asleep or  staying asleep see my previous article, ""16 Chronological Tips  to Improve Your Sleep.""

Top Superfoods to Eat When You're Pregnant,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/11/02/top-pregnancy-foods.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  There is rarely a more nutritionally demanding time during a woman's life than pregnancy (and later breastfeeding), when your intake of nutrients from foods and supplements are needed not only to keep your body running, but also to nourish and support your rapidly growing baby.   Proper nutrition is crucial at all stages of fetal development (and even before conception), and if mom doesn't eat right, her growing baby won't either. For a succinct and easy-to-follow overview of the types of foods and nutrients that will support a healthy pregnancy, read my optimized nutrition plan.   Ideally, by the time you enter pregnancy, you will already be in the Intermediate or Advanced stage, but even the Beginner stage is far better that the typical American diet. As you'll see, it is focused on minimizing processed foods while increasing your intake of vegetables, healthy fats, and high-quality sources of protein, all of which are ideal for nurturing a growing fetus.   If you're wondering about specific foods, see below for some of the top superfoods to eat when you're pregnant.  10 Top Foods to Eat When You're Pregnant   1. Vitamin D   Vitamin D isn't a food but rather is made by your body in response to sunlight exposure. It's so important, however, that it deserves to be number one on this list.   Raising vitamin D levels among pregnant women is of particular concern, as deficiency affects not only the mother, increasing her risk of complications during pregnancy or delivery, but also has short- and long-term ramifications for her child's health.   I firmly believe optimizing your vitamin D during pregnancy is one of the most important things you can do for the health of your child. When a child is born deficient in vitamin D, his or her health can be significantly affected in any number of ways.  Research confirms there is a lifelong impact of vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy ranging from childhood allergies to asthma, colds and flu, dental cavities, diabetes, and even strokes and cardiovascular disease in later life of the child.   Further, each year, more than half a million preemies are born, and it's the number one killer of newborns. It's also the second leading cause of death among children under the age of five. Research shows that vitamin D could likely prevent half of all these premature births.  It can also cut your risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and prenatal infections by approximately 50 percent. Among African-American and Hispanic populations, approximately 70 to 75 percent of all preterm births could be prevented with vitamin D optimization. Vitamin D screening is key.  This is the only way to determine whether you might be deficient or not, and regular testing is important to make sure whatever dosage of vitamin D you're taking is sufficient to reach clinically relevant levels. GrassrootsHealth, which has a panel of 42 researchers who provide scientific evidence, recommends maintaining a vitamin D blood serum level of 40 to 60 ng/ml to protect your and your baby's health.  However, according to previous studies, your levels need to be above 50 ng/ml to protect your baby from serious complications, such as premature delivery and preeclampsia.1 So please, if you're pregnant, make sure to get your 25-hydroxy D levels checked.  While optimizing your vitamin D through sensible sun exposure is best, if this isn't possible Dr. Bruce Hollis' research indicates that 50 percent of women can achieve this level with 4,000 IUs daily during pregnancy and 6,400 IUs (for nursing mothers) of vitamin D3 on a daily basis. Again, you'll need to have your vitamin D levels tested to be sure you're within the optimal range.  2. Organic Free-Range Eggs   Eggs are a phenomenal source of protein, fat, and other nutrients, including choline and the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin. In pregnant women, choline plays an important role helping to prevent certain birth defects, such as spina bifida, and playing a role in brain development.   Prior research has concluded that choline intake during pregnancy ""super-charged"" the brain activity of animals in utero, indicating that it may boost cognitive function, improve learning and memory, and even diminish age-related memory decline and the brain's vulnerability to toxins during childhood, as well as conferring protection later in life.2  Consumption of higher levels of choline during pregnancy (about double the recommended pregnancy intake) is linked to beneficial epigenetic changes in the fetus, including protection from stress-related and metabolic disorders, that likely last into adulthood.3  3. Wild-Caught Alaskan or Sockeye Salmon, Sardines    Fish has always been the best source for the animal-based omega-3 fats EPA and DHA, but as levels of pollution have increased you have to be very choosy about which types of seafood you decide to eat  especially when you're pregnant.  If you're not careful, the toxic effects from the pollutants in the fish will outweigh the benefits of the omega-3 fats. Among the safest in terms of contamination, and the highest in healthy omega-3 fat, is wild-caught Alaskan and sockeye salmon.   Neither is allowed to be farmed, and are therefore always wild-caught. The risk of sockeye accumulating high amounts of mercury and other toxins is reduced because of its short life cycle, which is only about three years.   Additionally, bioaccumulation of toxins is also reduced by the fact that it doesn't feed on other, already contaminated, fish. The two designations you want to look for on the label are: ""Alaskan salmon"" (or wild Alaskan salmon) and ""Sockeye salmon.""   Canned salmon labeled ""Alaskan salmon"" is also a reasonable choice and offers a less expensive alternative to salmon fillets. A general guideline is that the closer to the bottom of the food chain the fish is, the less contamination it will have accumulated, so other safer choices include smaller fish like sardines, anchovies, and herring.   Sardines, in particular, are one of the most concentrated sources of omega-3 fats. They also contain a wealth of other nutrients, from vitamin B12 and selenium to protein, calcium, and choline, making them one of the best dietary sources of animal-based omega-3s. You can also supplement your diet with animal-based omega-3s by taking a krill oil supplement.   4. Full-Fat Grass-Fed Dairy   Whole dairy products made from grass-fed raw milk are a rich source of healthy fats, protein, calcium, B vitamins, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, and more. Grass-fed raw butter, milk, and cheese from high-quality sources are all beneficial. Raw organic milk from grass-fed cows not only contains beneficial bacteria that prime your immune system and can help reduce allergies, it's also an outstanding source of vitamins (especially vitamin A), zinc, enzymes, and healthy fats. Your absolute best bet when it comes to yogurt is to make your own using a starter culture and raw grass-fed milk, which you combine and leave at room temperature overnight.  By the time you wake up in the morning, you will likely have kefir (fermented milk). If it hasn't obtained the consistency of yogurt, you might want to set it out a bit longer and then store it in the fridge. If you want to sweeten up your homemade yogurt naturally, try adding in some whole berries or dried (unsweetened) coconut.    5. Sweet Potatoes   Orange-colored sweet potatoes owe their appearance to the carotenoid beta-carotene. As an antioxidant, beta-carotene can help ward off free radicals that damage cells through oxidation, which can speed up aging and make you vulnerable against chronic diseases.   This antioxidant can help support your immune system, as well as lower your risk of heart disease and cancer. It's also very important during pregnancy, as it's converted into vitamin A in your body.   Vitamin A is essential for fetal health and development, but high levels of animal-based vitamin A may cause toxicity, making beta-carotene an ideal alternative. Sweet potatoes are also an excellent source of fiber, which can help support healthy blood sugar levels and improve digestion.   6. Broccoli and Leafy Greens  Broccoli and dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale are loaded with important nutrients for pregnant women, including folate, fiber, potassium, calcium, iron, and vitamins C, K, and A. Their rich antioxidant content will also support your immune system health and digestion, while their fiber can help prevent constipation, which is a common problem in pregnant women.  7. Grass-Fed Beef and Pasture-Raised Chicken   Grass-fed beef is an excellent source of protein and other nutrients in high demand during pregnancy, like iron, choline, and B vitamins. Chicken is an excellent source of protein, B vitamins, selenium, phosphorus, and choline. It provides all B vitamins along with a surprisingly varied number of additional nutrients.   8. Berries  Berries contain concentrated amounts of the disease-fighting phytochemicals found to boost your immunity, prevent cancer, protect your heart, and prevent seasonal allergies. Berries are lower in sugar than many fruits, so they are less likely to destabilize your insulin levels. Berries also contain high amounts of vitamin C, which will help your body absorb iron, and a good amount of fiber.  9. Avocados  Avocados provide close to 20 essential health-boosting nutrients, including potassium, vitamin E, vitamin K, B vitamins, and folate. They're also one of few foods that contain significant levels of both vitamins C and E and are an excellent source of healthy monounsaturated fat. Avocados are even high in fiber, with about 4.6 grams in half an avocado. Fiber plays an essential role in your digestive, heart, and skin health, and may improve blood sugar control, and more, so when you eat avocados you're really providing your body  and your baby  with a comprehensive package of nutrition.  10. Chia Seeds  Chia seeds are a quick and easy-to-use source of protein, healthy fats, dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants, all rolled into one neat package. Although they have similar health benefits to flax seeds, chia seeds may soon edge these out because they don't have to be ground prior to consumption, and they don't go rancid as quickly either. Their high concentration of the plant-based omega-3 fat alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is one of their major claims to fame. Chia seeds contain up to 40 percent oil, with 60 percent comprised of plant-based omega-3.4   New Benefits Revealed for a High-Fiber Diet During Pregnancy  A fiber-rich diet is recommended for most adults, but ramping up your fiber intake may be especially beneficial during pregnancy. Researchers from the Department of Immunology at Monash University in Australia revealed that a high-fiber diet may beneficially alter a woman's gut bacteria during pregnancy, producing anti-inflammatory substances that suppress asthma-related genes in her baby.5,6 Mounting research also suggests that a high-fiber diet can help reduce your risk of premature death from any cause, likely because it helps to reduce your risk of a number of chronic diseases.  This includes type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Studies have also linked a high-fiber diet to beneficial reductions in blood pressure, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced inflammation  all of which can benefit your baby. The best way to increase your fiber intake during pregnancy is to focus on eating more vegetables, nuts, and seeds. The following whole foods, for example, contain high levels of both soluble and insoluble fiber.     Psyllium seed husk, flax hemp, and chia seeds  Berries  Vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts    Root vegetables and tubers, including onions, sweet potatoes, and jicama Almonds Peas   Green beans Cauliflower Beans    Gaining Too Much Weight During Pregnancy Linked to Children's Obesity   Healthy weight gain is important and expected during pregnancy, but women who are overweight before pregnancy, and those who gain too much weight while pregnant, may be putting their babies at risk of childhood obesity. Researchers followed more than 700 women who returned for follow up with their children were 7 years old. Children of mothers who had been overweight prior to pregnancy were more likely to be overweight.   Women with greater weight gain during pregnancy were also more likely to have children with a higher percentage of body fat, and those with excessive weight gain were nearly three times more likely to have obese children than those who did not gain weight excessively during pregnancy.7 The Institute of Medicine recommends women of average weight gain 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy, while overweight women should gain 15 to 25 pounds and obese women gain just 11 to 20 pounds.8   More Risks Revealed for Lack of Vitamin D During Pregnancy  From my perspective, it is simply reprehensible malpractice for a health care professional to fail to address your vitamin D level if you're pregnant  it's just that important. For pregnant women, optimizing your vitamin D is even more important for your child's health and development than folate, which is routinely recommended for pregnant women.  Recent research shed even more light on what's at stake if your vitamin D levels are low during pregnancy. One study revealed that women with low levels of vitamins D and E in early pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of asthma in her child within the first 10 years of life.9 Separate research found newborns of mothers whose diets were deficient in vitamins D and E had airway cells that reacted more to irritants and allergens.10 This may, in turn, impact the development of asthma or allergies later in life. Separate research also added to past data linking low vitamin D levels during pregnancy with premature birth. Women with the lowest levels of vitamin D were 1.5 times more likely to deliver early than those with the highest levels, perhaps because vitamin D helps reduce bacterial infection in the placenta, which may trigger early delivery.11 Along with reducing your risk of premature birth, studies have found that vitamin D may protect against a number of birth defects and autism, as well as pregnancy complications like high blood pressure. It is absolutely imperative that pregnant women maintain a blood level of between 50 and 70 ng/ml of 25-hydroxy D, and I am hopeful that in the not too distant future it will be mandatory for pregnant women to receive regular vitamin D blood test levels.   Dad's Diet Matters for Baby's Health, Too  It's not only mom's diet that influences the future health of her offspring. A father's diet prior to conception may also play a role, particularly in regard to folate. An animal study showed that paternal folate deficiency was associated with an increase in birth defects in offspring compared to fathers eating a folate-sufficient diet. There was, in fact, a nearly 30 percent increase in birth defects, including severe skeletal abnormalities, among litters sired by fathers who were deficient in folate. The Epoch Times reported:12   ""The research shows that there are regions of the sperm epigenome that are sensitive to life experience and particularly to diet. And that this information is in turn transferred to a so-called epigenomic map that influences development and may also influence metabolism and disease in the offspring in the long term. The epigenome is like a switch, which is affected by environmental cues, and is involved in many diseases including cancer and diabetes.   The epigenome influences the way that genes are turned on or off and hence how heritable information gets passed along. Although it has been known for some time that there is a massive erasure and re-establishment that takes place in the epigenome as the sperm develops, this study shows that along with the developmental map, the sperm also carries a memory of the father's environment and possibly even of his diet and lifestyle choices.""   If You're Planning to Have Children, the Time to Start Eating Right Is Now   If you're a woman (or a man) in your childbearing years and you're planning to have children any time soon, it's imperative that you start eating healthy now. Research published in 2013 showed that women who ate a vegetable-rich diet during the year before pregnancy had a significantly lower risk of having a baby with certain birth defects compared to women who ate an unhealthy high-sugar diet.13 Specifically, compared to those who ate unhealthy, women on a healthy diet experienced:  One-half  lower risk of anencephaly, a neural-tube defect that interferes with brain  development and often results in miscarriage  Up  to a one-third lower risk of cleft lip  One-quarter  lower risk of cleft palate  One-fifth  lower risk of spina bifida, another neural-tube defect   Finally, one additional food group that hasn't yet been mentioned, but is crucially important for pregnant women, is fermented foods. Nearly everyone can benefit from the beneficial microbes in fermented vegetables, but if you are pregnant or planning to be, this is of utmost importance to you and your new baby. Research shows giving pregnant women and newborns doses of good bacteria like those found in fermented vegetables may:    Radically reduce your child's risk of developing autism or autism-like disordersProtect babies from developing eczema in childhoodHelp prevent childhood allergies  Help optimize your baby's weight later in lifeImprove the symptoms of colic, decreasing average crying times by about 75 percentReduce your risk of premature labor   For more detailed healthy pregnancy guidelines, please review my special report: ""No-Nonsense Guide to a Naturally Healthy Pregnancy and Baby,"" which covers far more than the basic nutrition tips offered here.

How Bronchitis Can Affect Pregnant Women,http://articles.mercola.com/bronchitis/bronchitis-in-pregnancy.aspx,"Unfortunately, pregnant women can be vulnerable to catching bronchitis. While being diagnosed with this irritating illness at any point in your pregnancy is alarming, the good news is that you can treat bronchitis and prevent further occurrences from happening. What Causes Bronchitis Among Pregnant Women? The main causes of bronchitis among pregnant women include viral or bacterial infections and exposure to irritants in the workplace or immediate environment. Some of the known viruses, bacteria strains or irritants that can trigger bronchitis include:1,2      Viruses  Bacteria Strains  Irritants     Rhinovirus Mycoplasma pneumoniae Cigarette or tobacco smoke   Adenovirus Streptococcus pneumoniae Smog   Influenza A and B Haemophilus influenza Chemical fumes   Parainfluenza virus Moraxella catarrhalis Dust particles    Bordetella pertussis     Common Symptoms of Bronchitis in Pregnant Women If you are pregnant and experience any of these indicators, you should consult with your physician or gynecologist to confirm if you have bronchitis:3,4     Sore throat  Dry cough    Gradual rise in temperature  Chest pain    Coughing up of blood  Fever greater than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius)    Experiencing shortness of breath that does not heal even with adequate rest  Drowsiness, weakness, irritability and fatigue    Loss of appetite     These Harmful Complications Might Occur If You Dont Treat the Condition ASAP Having a potential case of bronchitis treated as soon as possible is vital. There are certain complications that could arise and negatively affect your and your childs health if not acted upon immediately. Pregnant women who have bronchitis may experience breathing difficulties. The disease results in ineffective oxygen intake into the lungs since the bronchial walls have been inflamed. Because of this, the oxygen  in your body is depleted, making you breathe lesser than the optimal required levels and lowering the necessary oxygen supply sent to the baby.5 Appetite loss typically occurs among all types of people when they are sick, pregnant women included. Unfortunately, this could be detrimental to the babys growth and overall health, since eating less decreases the amount of nutrients that the baby can get from the mother.6 Should you or someone you know breathe in fumes or smoke during pregnancy, this could not only exacerbate existing inflammation in the lungs and lead to chronic bronchitis, but also put your baby at risk of complications such as:7,8     Lower birth weight: Smoking an average of one pack of cigarettes per day during pregnancy slashes half a pound from the babys birth weight. If a woman smokes two packs a day, the babys birth weight is decreased by 1 pound or more.    Underdeveloped lungs and breathing problems: Babies born to mothers who smoke may have bodies that are underdeveloped during pregnancy, which affects their lungs and other organs. Babies may require respirator use for days or weeks to help them breathe properly and ensure optimal lung function.  Plus, even if they are able to breathe on their own, a child can still experience breathing problems.     Higher risk for asthma or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).    Heart defects: A baby is more likely to have a heart defect at birth if the mother smoked during the first trimester of pregnancy.    Impaired brain function: Its said that learning disorders, behavioral problems and a relatively low IQ may be present among babies whose mothers smoked while pregnant.    Placental abruption: Severe cases of a respiratory disease like bronchitis is associated with placental abruption, or the separation of the placenta from the uterus prior to delivery. Smoking during pregnancy is a known risk factor of this condition.9    Bronchitis during pregnancy could also swiftly progress to a severe respiratory disease like pneumonia or cause a low-grade fever to occur along with the disease. Either way, these sicknesses, especially if they reach high temperatures, could be bad for the babys health.10 Should you become affected with pneumonia during pregnancy, there is a higher risk for preterm birth, serious maternal complications such as respiratory failure and low birth weight for the baby.11 Dehydration may also occur because the mother is not taking enough fluids, which could lead to contractions that can cause preterm labor. A higher risk for complications like spina bifida (a birth defect wherein a babys spine is not formed normally12) or even death may also result because of bronchitis.13 < Previous Bronchitis in Children Next > Bronchitis Prevention   Previous Bronchitis in Children   Next Bronchitis Prevention [+] Sources and References      1,4,5,6,7,13Malachi, 3 Causes & 5 Risk Factors Of Bronchitis During Pregnancy, Mom Junction, July 26, 20162Worrall, G.

Study: Pregnant Women Aren't Getting Enough Omega-3,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/04/27/omega-3-pregnant-women.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Omega-3 fats are known as essential fatty acids because the only way you can get them is via your diet. In pregnant women, consuming enough omega-3 fats is especially important, as theyre important for the babys visual and cognitive development. In the US, most Americans diets are seriously lacking in omega-3 fats. Women tend to become further depleted during pregnancy, as the fetus uses omega-3s for nervous system development. After birth, omega-3s are again used to make breast milk, and for women on their second or third pregnancy, levels may be extremely low. Generally, with each subsequent pregnancy, women become further depleted in omega-3s.1 New research from the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary in Canada further confirmed that most pregnant women are seriously lacking in these beneficial fats.  Most Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women Arent Getting Enough Omega-3s  The American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada recommend that pregnant and lactating women (along with all adults) consume at least 500 milligrams (mg) of omega-3s, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), daily.  The European Commission recommends that pregnant and lactating women consume a minimum of 200 mg of DHA, in particular, per day.2 In a study of more than 2,000 women, the majority did not meet these recommendations. In fact, only 27 percent of pregnant women and 25 percent of women at three months postpartum met the EUs DHA recommendation.3 Overall, 79 percent of the omega-3s in the womens diets came from seafood, fish, and seaweed products, with the majority from salmon, however this often wasnt enough to provide therapeutic levels of omega-3s that are critical for infant development.  Health Canada recommends pregnant women consume one to two portions a week of fish high in omega-3 fats to help increase levels. The study also found that women taking an animal-based omega-3 fat supplement were much more likely to meet the recommendations.  Women who took a supplement containing DHA were 10.6 and 11 times more likely to meet the current EU consensus recommendation for pregnancy and postpartum, respectively. The researchers noted, taking a supplement significantly improved the likelihood that they would meet recommendations. Unfortunately, nearly half (44 percent) of the women who reported taking an omega-3 fat supplement during pregnancy were no longer doing so while breastfeeding at three months postpartum, a period of crucial development for the infant.  The researchers recommended nutritional counseling and education to help women understand that the omega-3 supplement offers continued benefits during breastfeeding and should be continued beyond pregnancy.  The Importance of Omega-3 Fats During Pregnancy  It's important to realize that your body cannot form omega-3 fats, so a fetus must obtain all of its omega-3 fats from his mother's diet. Hence, a mother's dietary intake and plasma concentrations of DHA directly influence the DHA status of the developing fetus, which can impact your child's brain development. Research has linked inadequate intake of omega-3 fats in pregnant women to premature birth, increased risk of preeclampsia, and low birth weight, in addition to hyperactivity in children. Adding EPA and DHA to the diet of pregnant women has also been found to benefit visual and cognitive development in the baby, while also reducing the risk of allergies in infants.4 After delivery and while breastfeeding, omega-3 fats continue to be important, both for baby and for mom. In women, low levels of omega-3 are linked to an increased risk of postpartum depression.5 In children, supplementation early in life increases intelligence. In one study, a group of infants received either an omega-3 fat supplement or a placebo.6 Tests to evaluate their cognition were given every six months starting at age 18 months and continuing until they were 6 years old. While no changes were noted in the early test done at 18 months, the study found that infants consuming omega-3 fats outscored the placebo group later, between 3 and 5 years old. The omega-3 fat group scored higher on rule learning, vocabulary, and intelligence testing, which suggests early omega-3 fat supplementation, during the key period when your childs brain is still developing, may pay off with greater intelligence in the pre-school and school-aged years. Omega-3 levels even appear to influence sleep in children. Children taking daily supplements of omega-3 fats had nearly one hour more sleep and seven fewer waking episodes per night compared with children taking a placebo.7  Should Pregnant Women Eat Fish?  Fish has always been one of the best sources for the animal-based omega-3 fats EPA and DHA, but as levels of pollution have increased, this treasure of a food has become less and less viable as a primary source of healthy fats.  The good news is that about 70 percent of tested wild-caught fish consumed in the US contain relatively low levels of mercury.8 However, fish like tuna, marlin, shark, barracuda, and swordfish have some of the highest levels of contamination.  So while consuming fish can certainly be beneficial, pregnant women in particular should be sure to choose the right kinds of fish to receive maximum benefits with minimal exposure to pollutants like mercury.  Mercury can cross the placenta to harm the rapidly developing nervous system in your baby, including the brain. Studies have associated prenatal methylmercury exposure with impaired development of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, resulting in learning difficulties, poor coordination, and inability to concentrate.  About 10 percent of the US populationincluding many children, pregnant women, and women of childbearing age, in particularhave mercury levels above the levels currently recommended for fetal and child health.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are in the process of updating the national advisory for fish consumption for pregnant women, nursing mothers, women of childbearing age, and young children. They now recommend pregnant women eat 8 to 12 ounces of a variety of fish each week from choices that are lower in mercury.  Tuna Is a Large Source of Mercury Exposure   They recommend avoiding high-mercury fish including tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel, and limiting white (albacore) tuna to 6 ounces a week. The lower mercury fish choices they recommend include salmon, shrimp, pollock, tilapia, catfish, cod and, unfortunately, tuna (light canned).  Tuna is one of the largest sources of mercury exposure in Americans diets, and anyone who wants to reduce their mercury intake probably needs to eat less of it. Research published in 2010, which quantified the contributions to total mercury in the US seafood supply by 51 different varieties of fish and shellfish, found that tuna was responsible for more than one-third of Americans' total exposure to methylmercury.9 According to the author:   ""The analysis performed here identifies the relative importance of different fish and shellfish as sources of mercury in the US seafood supply and proposes improved consumer advice, so that the public can benefit from fish consumption while minimizing mercury exposure.   Except for swordfish, most fish with the highest mercury levels are relatively minor contributors to total inputs. Tuna (canned light, canned albacore, and fresh/frozen varieties) accounts for 37.4 percent of total mercury inputs, while two-thirds of the seafood supply and nine of the 11 most heavily consumed fish and shellfish are low or very low in mercury.Substantial improvement in risk communication about mercury in fish and seafood is needed; in particular, several population subsets need better guidance to base their seafood choices more explicitly on mercury content.""   Further, a 2012 report by the Mercury Policy Project offers risk management advice for schools and parents, and warns that canned tuna is a major source of mercury exposure in children, which has implications for pregnant women as well.10Based on average contamination levels in tested samples, small children should eat light tuna no more than twice a month, according to the Mercury Policy Project, and albacore tuna should be avoided entirely.  Which Fish Are the Best Sources of Omega-3 Fats?   In addition to contamination concerns, the tuna population has also been decimated due to over-fishing, so I believe it is best to avoid tuna and make better choices when consuming seafood. Wild-caught Alaskan salmon, for example, is one very low mercury fish. Farmed salmon may contain only about half of the omega-3 of wild salmon and may also contain harmful contaminants, including environmental toxins, synthetic astaxanthin, and genetically engineered organisms from the grain feed theyre given  so choosing wild-caught Alaskan is important.  Unfortunately, salmon are often mislabeled. Studies have shown that as much as 70 percent to 80 percent of the fish marked ""wild"" are actually farmed. Avoid Atlantic salmon, as typically salmon labeled ""Atlantic Salmon"" currently comes from fish farms.The two designations you want to look for are: Alaskan salmon, and sockeye salmon, as Alaskan sockeye is not allowed to be farmed. So canned salmon labeled ""Alaskan Salmon"" is a good bet, and if you find sockeye salmon, it's bound to be wild.Cod and catfish, while lower in mercury, also primarily come from aquatic fish farms these days, so arent one of the best options.Other fish with short life cycles also tend to be better alternatives in terms of fat content, so its a win-win situation  lower contamination risk and higher nutritional value. A general guideline is that the closer to the bottom of the food chain the fish is, the less contamination it will have accumulated. This includes:  Sardines Anchovies  Herring   Sardines, in particular, are one of the most concentrated sources of omega-3 fats, with one serving containing more than 50 percent of your recommended daily value.11 In addition, look for fish that contains the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) label. The MSC label on wild-caught fish identifies seafood that is caught using sustainable, eco-friendly methods.   Whats the Optimal Source of Omega-3 Fats?   While a helpful form of omega-3 (ALA) can be found in flaxseed, chia, hemp, and a few other foods, the most beneficial form of omega-3 -- containing the two fatty acids DHA and EPA, which are essential to brain function -- can only be found in fish and krill. While your body can convert ALA into DHA/EPA, it only does so at a very low ratio, and only when sufficient enzymes (that many people are deficient in) are present. Youre probably aware that if you dont eat a lot of fish, you can supplement your diet with omega-3 fats with fish oil. Less widely known is that you can also get your omega-3s from krill oil, and it may, in fact, be preferable to do so.  The omega-3 in krill is attached to phospholipids that increase its absorption, which means you need less of it, and it won't cause belching or burping like many other fish oil products. Additionally, it naturally contains astaxanthin, a potent antioxidantalmost 50 times more than is present in fish oil. This prevents the highly perishable omega-3 fats from oxidizing before you are able to integrate them into your cellular tissue.   In laboratory tests, krill oil remained undamaged after being exposed to a steady flow of oxygen for 190 hours. Compare that to fish oil, which went rancid after just one hour. That makes krill oil nearly 200 times more resistant to oxidative damage compared to fish oil! When purchasing krill oil, you'll want to read the label and check the amount of astaxanthin it contains. The more the better, but anything above 0.2 mg per gram of krill oil will protect it from rancidity.   If you dont regularly eat safe forms of fish like wild Alaskan salmon or sardines, I recommend supplementing with krill oil before and during pregnancy, and while breastfeeding. Infants receive vital DHA through your breast milk, so if you can continue breastfeeding through at least the first year, you will give your child a great head start for success in life. Then, as soon as your child can safely swallow a capsule, he or she can start taking a high-quality krill oil supplement. The capsules should be kid-sized  about half the size of a regular capsule  and odor-free, making them easy and palatable for kids to swallow.

How to Deal With Hemorrhoids If You're Pregnant,http://articles.mercola.com/hemorrhoids/hemorrhoids-in-pregnancy.aspx,"Unfortunately, pregnant women are predisposed to a higher risk of having hemorrhoids.1 These often appear during the third trimester. Follow These Pain-Relieving Techniques In some cases, hemorrhoids develop while a woman is pushing during labor, and this may be a reason why hemorrhoids are a common early postpartum complaint.2 Fortunately, there are certain measures you can follow to relieve painful hemorrhoids during your pregnancy:3,4    Take a bath in warm water: use plain warm water and soak several times daily for about 10 to 15 minutes. Not only will a bath keep you clean, but it will potentially reduce discomfort too.   Try witch hazel: apply witch hazel pads to your anal area, but make sure to change these pads frequently.   Refrain from sitting for long periods of time: you increase pressure on the veins in your anus and rectum when you sit. However, if certain circumstances require you to sit down, make sure to stand up every once in a while.   Try an over-the-counter hemorrhoid remedy: there are hemorrhoid creams or medicated wipes available that are safe to use while pregnant. However, you should ask your physician or health care provider on what the best option is for you before buying and/or trying these remedies. Take note though that hemorrhoid creams cannot treat hemorrhoids, as they simply relieve pain caused by these swollen blood vessels.   Sleep on your side and not on your back: this will decrease the pressure on your backside.   Use a bidet to clean yourself thoroughly after bowel movement: you get more benefits from a bidet in the long run. It is less irritating and cleans your bottom more efficiently. If you dont have a bidet at home, use gentle, fragrance-free wipes or wet, two-ply, white toilet paper (preferably with warm water). Do not wipe your backside too hard because this can irritate your already sensitive skin.   Purchase a donut-shaped pillow: this can reduce the pressure brought about by sitting.  Make These Changes to Your Eating Habits Constipation, whether youre pregnant or not, greatly influences the development of hemorrhoids. As much as possible, do whatever you can to relieve constipation and consequently prevent hemorrhoids:5,6    Add fiber to your diet: getting enough dietary fiber in your body softens your stools and increases its weight and size. Improved stool quality can lead to the normalizing of your bowel movements, effectively preventing constipation and hemorrhoids in the long run.7 Just make sure to add these fiber-rich foods slowly to prevent gas problems.8   Drink plenty of pure water: by increasing your intake of pure water, you maintain your stools softness and allow it to pass easier. According to Yuri Elkaim, a registered holistic nutritionist, when youre constipated your colon is dehydrated, so when you drink enough water, you not only keep your body hydrated, but less water will be withdrawn from the colon.9   Incorporate physical activity into your daily routine: refrain from sitting or standing for a long period of time. A brisk five-minute walk every hour or so can already help improve circulation in the anal area and flush your stool out with less pain.  If you want to do a variety of exercises, consult your doctor first to know which workouts are safe for pregnant women. Kegel exercises are an example as they improve circulation in the anal area and inhibit hemorrhoids. If complications such as increased pain or bleeding still occur after you have tried these suggestions, consult your physician or health care provider. For pregnant women, hemorrhoids typically heal after delivery. Should the hemorrhoids still persist, homemade treatment protocols work best in eliminating them. If they worsen, ask your physician if surgical treatment might be necessary. < Previous Hemorrhoids Symptoms Next > Hemorrhoids Treatment   Previous Hemorrhoids Symptoms   Next Hemorrhoids Treatment [+] Sources and References      1,2Nordqvist, Hemorrhoids: Facts, Causes and Treatments, Medical News Today, December 31, 20153,6Hemorrhoids during pregnancy, Baby Center4,7Harms, What can I do to treat hemorrhoids during pregnancy?, Mayo Clinic, November 11, 20145Hemorrhoids During Pregnancy, What to Expect, October 5, 20158Mayo Clinic Staff, Dietary fiber: Essential for a diet, Mayo Clinic, September 22, 20159Mayo Clinic Staff, Prevention, Mayo Clinic, June 19, 201310Elkaim, The 5-Step Constipation Solution, U.S. News Health, December 2, 2013"
Anxiety Among Pregnant Women,http://articles.mercola.com/anxiety/pregnancy.aspx,"Being responsible for the health and well-being of an unborn child is no easy task. As such, expectant mothers tend to worry about the following aspects of life during a pregnancy:1    Pregnancy symptoms and their meanings  Progress of the babys development  Relationship with a partner  Monetary issues   Given that there are hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy, emotions tend to go haywire and make pregnant women more vulnerable to anxiety. First-time mothers typically feel overwhelmed, scared or uneasy because of this life-changing event.2  Prevalence of Anxiety Disorders During Pregnancy  Anxiety disorders are actually common among pregnant women. A 2009 poll conducted by the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) found that around 52 percent of pregnant women experienced increased anxiety or depression.3   There are certain factors that pregnant women should watch out for that could increase their risk for an anxiety disorder, such as:4      A previous diagnosis of an anxiety disorder  Experiences of anxiety during a past pregnancy    Previous pregnancy loss  Fertility struggles    Pregnancy with complications or bed rest  Stress at home or work   Warning Signs of Anxiety Disorders in Pregnant Women  Believe it or not, anxiety is considered a sign of a pregnancy, especially during the first trimester.5 Although its normal to worry about certain events during a pregnancy, it can become a serious problem when a woman finds it difficult to control her thoughts or feels miserable or depressed.    These actually are the first signs of an anxiety disorder, along with other symptoms like:6      Mental  Physical     Feeling nervous, anxious or on the edge most of the time Racing heartbeat   Inability to stop or control anxious thoughts Rapid breathing   Worrying over a range of different things Dizziness   Difficulty relaxing Excessive sweating   Restlessness Muscle tension, pain or trembling   Irritability and short-temperedness Numbing or tingling sensation in your fingers, toes or lips   Feeling afraid or thinking that bad things will occur      Some women may experience panic attacks when these aforementioned symptoms arise quickly and intensely, but they tend to get better in 10 minutes or so.7  How Anxiety Disorders Could Affect a Mother and Her Child  Consulting a psychiatrist or mental professional as soon as these first indicators of anxiety disorders appear is important, because they can have adverse effects, such as:8      Risks for the Mother  Risks for the Child        Suicide  Termination of pregnancy  Postpartum anxiety or depression  Substance use (alcohol or drugs)  Impaired attachment to the baby  Failure to take good care of her physical health  Preeclampsia  Preterm labor  Higher chance of undergoing a C-section      Low birthweight  Premature birth before 37 weeks  Low APGAR score, a test performed one and five minutes9 after birth to check a newborns health  Poor adaptation to life outside the womb, such as development of respiratory distress and jitteriness      Banish Your Feelings of Anxiety With the Proper Mentality  Pregnant women can take measures that will help in alleviating their anxiety, even without taking anti-anxiety medications that may cause negative side effects.    The very first step that a pregnant woman should take if she experiences panic attacks is to relax and calm down. Although some may say this is easier said than done, anxious women can try practicing the following techniques suggested by Morag Martindale in BabyCentre:10    Breathing deeply and slowly: This can help lessen symptoms of both panic and anxiety. As you breathe in, count slowly from 1 to 3, and do the same once you breathe out. Its also helpful if you breathe into your stomach instead of the chest, so the belly moves with each breath. Closing your eyes and focusing on your breathing could also be helpful, as suggested by the NHS.11  Focusing your attention to a specific object: Since this could be difficult for some people, this should only be done if the woman is capable of doing it despite suffering an attack. Examples of items you can focus on include a clock and its ticking hand or the melodies of a soothing song.  Visualizing a happy place: This involves imagining a peaceful, beautiful and calm place where you are surrounded by loved ones. Some people may find this easier to do when there is no panic attack.  Avoid fighting it: Counteracting these feelings could actually worsen the situation. If youre experiencing an attack, try to remember that there is no imminent danger and that the attack will soon be over. Make it a point to positively reassure yourself that you are OK until the attacks subside.   Another effective way to potentially relieve anxious feelings is by practicing the Emotional Freedom Techniques (EFT). This is an energy psychology tool that can assist in reconfiguring your bodys reactions to everyday stress and help reduce your chances of being affected with negative health effects.    The principle behind EFT is actually similar to that of acupunctures  a vital energy moves through your body via invisible passageways called meridians. When you practice EFT, use your fingers to tap certain energy meridian points in your body, and at the same time, speak to yourself using verbal affirmations. The good news is, you can practice EFT alone or under the supervision of a qualified therapist.  Lifestyle Changes to Reduce Your Stress Levels  Dont forget to incorporate these potentially stress-busting practices into your lifestyle as well:12    Getting enough sleep: Studies have shown that lack of sleep could trigger anxiety symptoms, so try to get at least seven to eight hours of sleep per night.  Eating whole and fresh food: A diet composed of fresh and organically grown fruits and vegetables, high-quality and grass-fed protein and healthy fats benefits both your mental and physical health. Plus, a healthy diet is also known to help boost the amount of beneficial bacteria in your gut.  Exercising: Apart from enhancing your mood and potentially lessening the risk of anxiety, getting a good workout while youre pregnant could also improve sleep and decrease aches and pains. Exercising could even help you prepare for birth since it assists in strengthening muscles and building endurance.13 Some of the best exercises for pregnant women include walking, aerobics, yoga, stretching and even weight training. Make sure you consult with a physician before doing any of these exercises.14  Building a support system: Isolating yourself because you have an anxiety disorder can exacerbate the symptoms.15 Spend time with friends, especially those who have anxiety disorders, or seek the advice of experienced parents. You should also consider joining support groups, whether in person or online, so you can share your experiences with people who feel the same way you do.  Scheduling relaxing activities during the day: Making time for activities such as regular meditation or acupuncture can help alleviate anxious feelings. Other examples of relaxing practices you should try include yoga, listening to soothing music or having a massage.

Fibromyalgia and Pregnancy: What You Need to Know,http://articles.mercola.com/fibromyalgia/pregnancy.aspx,"For most women, pregnancy comes with a host of unpleasant symptoms like morning sickness or nausea, back pain, and insomnia. If you are suffering from fibromyalgia, which is actually more prevalent in women, is it possible for you to go through pregnancy safely, and without the unbearable pain?   There are actually conflicting ideas on the effects of fibromyalgia on pregnancy. Some experts claim that pregnancy can trigger or worsen the symptoms. However, some doctors say that pregnant women with fibromyalgia experience less painful symptoms.    Pregnancy Can Worsen or Improve Fibromyalgia  One study conducted in 2005 suggests that pregnancy can worsen the hallmark symptoms of fibromyalgia, namely pain, fatigue, and psychological stress. Karen Schaefer, Ph.D., assistant professor of Nursing at Temple University's College of Health Professions and author of this study, said:1   ""This data is the first step toward gathering hard evidence of FM effects on this group and will hopefully help us identify ways to reduce the impact of fibromyalgia during pregnancy.""       An earlier study, conducted in 1997, from Norway presented the same findings. For the test subjects, the third trimester was the most challenging period, with their symptoms increasing in frequency.    They also experienced postpartum depression. Nevertheless, their babies were healthy, delivered full-term and had normal birth weight.2   On the other hand, some physicians believe that people with fibromyalgia actually had reduced symptoms. There are pregnant women who claim that, after overcoming nausea and morning sickness, they actually felt better than before they became pregnant.    Its believed that this relief is brought on by relaxin, an ovarian hormone that increases up to 10-fold during pregnancy.3   Dr. Daniel Clauw, a professor of Anesthesiology, Rheumatology and Psychiatry at the University of Michigan, speculates that oxytocin, which is released during pregnancy, childbirth, and breastfeeding, may play a role in relieving fibromyalgia pain as well. He says: ""It's at least theoretically possible that some of the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy make pain better.""4   Regardless of whether or not you feel pain during pregnancy, its best to avoid taking medications at all costs. Some drugs are purposefully not tested in pregnant women, and their effects on you and your baby are unknown. If you do experience fibromyalgia pain, try pain relief methods such as stretching, meditation, yoga, very light massage, or even pool therapy. Get enough rest as well.  Fibromyalgia and Breastfeeding  While the effects of pregnancy on fibromyalgia symptoms still vary, one thing has been concluded: fibromyalgia makes breastfeeding quite difficult. This is mostly caused by the muscle pain associated with the illness. Some women also feel the fibromyalgia symptoms returning after giving birth. For this reason, you must make breastfeeding as stress-free as possible. Some easy ways to do this include:    Use adequate support, such as a pillow or sling, when breastfeeding your baby.   Try lying on your side with your baby facing you  it will make feeding easier while allowing your body to rest.   Nurse in a quiet area, away from other people, so you can focus on bonding with your little one.  < Previous Is Fibromyalgia Hereditary?

Appendicitis During Pregnancy,http://articles.mercola.com/appendicitis/pregnancy.aspx,"Women are particularly more sensitive when they are expecting, as their body goes through many hormonal and physical changes. Certain types of pain are common during this period, particularly abdominal pain.    This is usually normal and is brought on by the expanding uterus, stretching of the ligaments and shifting of the organs. But in some cases, abdominal pain during pregnancy is brought on by certain health conditions  appendicitis is one of them.    Remember that having appendicitis while pregnant can be particularly dangerous both for you and your baby. This is why you should be on the lookout for this ailment and seek help immediately if you feel the symptoms of this ailment.    Incidence of Appendicitis in Pregnant Women  During pregnancy, appendicitis is the most common and non-obstetric emergency that may entail surgery. Its not a rare disorder and is seen in approximately 1 out of 1,500 pregnancies.1  It commonly happens during the second or third trimester, although it may also occur during the first trimester.    The appendicitis incidence rates range from 19 to 36 percent during the first trimester, 27 to 60 percent during the second trimester and 15 to 33 percent during the last three months of pregnancy.2   The incidence of appendicitis in women, is the same whether they are pregnant or not. However, pregnancy increases the risk of perforation.3   Whats alarming is that expectant mothers who have gone through an appendectomy are at a higher risk of fetal loss,4 especially if this condition occurs during early pregnancy and if the mother fails to receive appropriate medical attention immediately.5   Premature contractions and early labor may also be prompted by appendicitis, especially during the third trimester.6  This Condition May Be Mistaken as a Sign of Labor  The problem with accurately diagnosing appendicitis if youre pregnant is that the signs and symptoms are typically similar to those of pregnancy or the onset of labor. Aside from pain in the lower right abdomen, the most common symptoms include:7    Loss of appetite (anorexia)  Nausea  Vomiting   Fever and diarrhea are not common, although uterine contractions and painful or difficult urination (dysuria) may be felt. In some cases, the pain may be in the upper instead of lower right belly, because the appendix changes position during pregnancy.8  Appendicitis During This Delicate Period Must Be Addressed Immediately  If youre pregnant and are experiencing any of the symptoms above, have yourself (and your baby) checked immediately. If not diagnosed and treated promptly, appendicitis can lead to potentially dangerous side effects. This includes complications such as preterm labor, infection and risk of fetal or maternal loss. There is very low risk of the mother dying from appendicitis, though, with less than 2 percent succumbing to this illness. However, your infants health may be in jeopardy.    Those at a higher gestational age have a higher risk of perforation. If the appendix bursts during the third trimester, preterm labor might happen, and if no surgical intervention is done, the risk of fetal loss rises. The first week after the surgery is the riskiest, as it may lead to premature delivery  both the mother and unborn child should be closely monitored during this period.9  Previous Appendicitis in Children Next Appendicitis Duration   Previous Appendicitis in Children   Next Appendicitis Duration [+] Sources and References      1,6American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, May 2000;182(5):1027-92,7,9The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, 2006;19(6):621-6263,4Motherisk, Appendicitis during pregnancy, March 20045Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica, Oct 1999;78(9):758-628Everyday Health, Symptoms of Appendicitis, July 22, 2014"
Is Acetaminophen Safe During Pregnancy?,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/08/31/acetaminophen-during-pregnancy.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola Acetaminophen,  also known as paracetamol (International Nonproprietary Name),1 may be one of the more dangerous drugs you can purchase. This may surprise you  since most households carry one or two variations of the product to treat  headaches, fever or cold symptoms. Acetaminophen  is classified as an analgesic, or a medication acting to relieve pain.  According to the American Association of Poison Control Centers, analgesics are  the No. 1 reason people call a poison control center.2  The  U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) links 980 deaths per year to  acetaminophen and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)  determined that, beginning in 2006, the number of people who died after  accidentally taking too much acetaminophen exceeded the number who purposely  overdosed on acetaminophen.3 However,  these numbers may be deceiving, as other researchers have found 56,000  emergency room visits and 26,000 hospitalizations can be attributed to  acetaminophen.4  Although  frighteningly high for a drug most people routinely keep in their homes, this  isn't the only damage acetaminophen may cause.  A recent study published in the  Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) Pediatrics has linked taking acetaminophen  during pregnancy with conduct disorders and hyperactivity in children.5 Acetaminophen  During Pregnancy Linked to Hyperactivity and Conduct Disorders The  objective of this British study was to examine the association between  behavioral problems in children and mothers who took acetaminophen during pregnancy  and/or during the postpartum months, or partners who took acetaminophen.6 The  researchers concluded: ""Children exposed to acetaminophen prenatally are at  increased risk of multiple behavioral difficulties.""7 The researchers did find that these results were not explained by social  factors or other behavioral challenges linked to increased use of  acetaminophen. As  compared to individuals who did not use acetaminophen during their pregnancy, those who took the  drug during weeks 18 and 32 had a 31 percent increased risk of hyperactivity  and a 42 percent higher relative risk of conduct disorders in their children.8 This  study controlled for a number of different variables that could have affected  the results, such as genetics, smoking and alcohol use.9 There were over 7,700 participants. Not  everyone was convinced by the results of the study. Even lead author,  epidemiologist Evie Stergiakouli, PH.D., of the University of Bristol, stepped around  the issue, saying:10  ""Observational associations do not necessarily mean  that there is a causal association between the risk factor and the health  outcome.""  However,  the researchers also noted (quoted from Medical News Today):11  ""Children exposed to acetaminophen use prenatally are  at increased risk of multiple behavioral difficulties  Given the widespread  use of acetaminophen among pregnant women, this can have important implications  on public health advice.""   Other Studies Confirm Results and Identify More  Risk While  recent, this is not the only study associating acetaminophen with dangerous side  effects to your health and the health of your children.    A  recent study from the Center for Research in Environmental Epidemiology (CERAL),  Barcelona, Spain, found a link between acetaminophen use during pregnancy and hyperactivity and autism.12 Researchers discovered  more symptoms of autism in boys whose mothers took acetaminophen during  pregnancy, than in girls.  They found that all children exposed to acetaminophen  during pregnancy were 30 percent more likely by age 5 to demonstrate attention  impairments linked with hyperactivity disorder or autism.13  A  study found an association between the drug and children later diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD).14  Children whose mothers  used acetaminophen during pregnancy were at higher risk for hyperkinetic  disorder, use of ADHD medications or having ADHD-like behavior by age 7. There  was a stronger association when mothers took the drug in more than one  trimester.  A  study published in 2009 found mothers who used acetaminophen in the third  trimester were at higher risk for preterm birth.15   A  study published in 2013 found children exposed to acetaminophen during  pregnancy developed motor skills, communication and language skills more slowly  than those children who were not exposed.16  Use  of acetaminophen during pregnancy also appears to be linked to pre-eclampsia  and thromboembolic diseases,17 and taking the drug for more than four weeks during pregnancy, especially  during the first and second trimester, moderately increases the risk of  undescended testicles in boys.18  Acetaminophen Use and Toxicity     In  this short video, CBS News explains the statistics and risks associated with acetaminophen  use. The drug works by blocking feelings of pain and reduces fever without addressing the  source of the issue. As your body metabolizes the drug, it may damage your  liver. In 2009 the FDA issued this warning:19  ""Liver warning: This product contains acetaminophen. Severe  liver damage may occur if you take more than 4,000 mg of acetaminophen in 24  hours; with other drugs containing acetaminophen [or three] or more alcoholic  drinks every day while using this product.""  In 2014, the FDA  updated their warning to include:20  ""FDA is recommending health care professionals discontinue  prescribing and dispensing prescription combination drug products that contain  more than 325 milligrams (mg) of acetaminophen per tablet, capsule or other  dosage unit.""  Unfortunately,  there are times you may be taking more acetaminophen than you realize as the  drug is a common addition to other pain and over-the-counter cold remedies.   Vicodin and Percocet are two common prescription pain medications that include  acetaminophen, increasing your risk of acetaminophen poisoning, one of the more  common forms of toxicity, according to the National Institutes of Health (NIH).21 Other  common brand name over-the-counter medications that include acetaminophen in  their active ingredients include:22     Actifed Alka Seltzer Plus Anacin Cepacol   Contac Coricidin Dayquil Dimetapp   Dristan Excedrin Feverall Formula 44   Liquiprin Midol Mucinex Nyquil   Panadol Robitussin Saint Joseph Aspirin-Free Singlet   Sinutab Sudafed Theraflu Triaminic   Vanquish Vicks   As  the drug is a common ingredient in other over-the-counter medications, and has  a narrow therapeutic index, it is easy to accidentally overdose or take enough  to cause significant liver  damage.23 Doses over 5,000 mg per day if you don't consume alcohol, and 4,000 mg if you  do consume alcohol, can trigger significant liver damage. There's 4,000 mg of  acetaminophen in just eight extra strength tablets. While  other countries have placed a limit on how much consumers may purchase and have  restricted sales to pharmacies, no such limits are placed in the U.S.24 From 2001 to 2010, the related deaths attributed to acetaminophen were twice that  of all other over-the-counter pain relievers combined. Number of Children With ADHD Rising In  both private insurance and Medicaid populations, the number of children being  treated with drugs for ADHD continues to rise. According to the CDC,  approximately 3 out of 4 children between age 2 and 5 receive medication for  ADHD, but only half of those receive any form of psychological services.25 In  2011, approximately 11 percent of children between the ages of 4 and 17 were  diagnosed with ADHD. This is a significant rise from 7.8 percent in 2003.26The rate of diagnosis of ADHD also varies by state  in the U.S., with the highest being Kentucky at 18.7 percent and the lowest being  Nevada at 5.6 percent. According  to the National Survey of Children's Health, the average age of diagnosis is  6.2 years; 3.5 million children are taking medication for treatment, and boys  continue to be twice as likely as girls to be diagnosed with ADHD.27   Medications  used to treat this hyperactivity disorder are stimulants, which come with their  own list of side effects and dangers. Common side effects include headaches,  upset stomach and increased blood pressure. Less commonly, children may  experience loss of appetite, weight loss, insomnia and tics.28 Natural Alternatives for Pain, Fever and  Anti-Inflammatory Treatment Although  the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology (ACOG) continues to recommend  acetaminophen for treatment of minor discomfort, fever and pain during  pregnancy,29 the choice is ultimately yours. It will be you, your child and your family who  experience the repercussions from using medication that may affect your child's  neurological development. There  are other choices for treatment. Dr. Aisling Murphy, assistant clinical  professor at University of California Los Angeles Obstetrics and Gynecology, admitted to  CNN:30  ""Minor aches and pains (e.g., headaches or mild  backache), are common in pregnancy and often are a reason for patients to take  acetaminophen. The practice is very common.""  However,  she also counsels her patients to use other methods first, and avoid any  unnecessary medication during pregnancy, including acetaminophen. These alternative  modalities may include:  Hot  or cold packs to the area may help reduce discomfort or pain. However, do not  use a sauna or hot tub as these raise your core temperature, increasing the  risk for miscarriage or some birth defects.31 Your headache or muscle aches may  respond well to massage to increase relaxation and improve blood flow to aching  muscles or joints. Ginger tea may help relieve  tension and sooth your aching head. However, not all herbal teas are safe  during pregnancy. Teas contain many of the same nutrients as foods, but in more  concentrated forms. Ginger tea may help relieve aching muscles, reduce insulin  resistance, ease morning sickness and relieve stress.32 Use fresh organic ginger root to steep your own tea at home and avoid the  potential of accidentally ingesting harmful additives. Essential oils are  another way to relax, unwind and reduce pain and discomfort. A favorite of some  midwives is Frankincense topically, in your bath water or as a scent in your  room.33,34 Getting  plenty of sleep may also help reduce your perception of discomfort and pain.  During pregnancy your body is working to develop a new human being. You require  more rest and sleep than you normally would. Lack of sleep may increase your  perception of pain and discomfort. If you have trouble falling asleep or  staying asleep see my previous article, ""16 Chronological Tips  to Improve Your Sleep.""

How Bronchitis Can Affect Pregnant Women,http://articles.mercola.com/bronchitis/bronchitis-in-pregnancy.aspx,"Unfortunately, pregnant women can be vulnerable to catching bronchitis. While being diagnosed with this irritating illness at any point in your pregnancy is alarming, the good news is that you can treat bronchitis and prevent further occurrences from happening. What Causes Bronchitis Among Pregnant Women? The main causes of bronchitis among pregnant women include viral or bacterial infections and exposure to irritants in the workplace or immediate environment. Some of the known viruses, bacteria strains or irritants that can trigger bronchitis include:1,2      Viruses  Bacteria Strains  Irritants     Rhinovirus Mycoplasma pneumoniae Cigarette or tobacco smoke   Adenovirus Streptococcus pneumoniae Smog   Influenza A and B Haemophilus influenza Chemical fumes   Parainfluenza virus Moraxella catarrhalis Dust particles    Bordetella pertussis     Common Symptoms of Bronchitis in Pregnant Women If you are pregnant and experience any of these indicators, you should consult with your physician or gynecologist to confirm if you have bronchitis:3,4     Sore throat  Dry cough    Gradual rise in temperature  Chest pain    Coughing up of blood  Fever greater than 100 degrees Fahrenheit (37 degrees Celsius)    Experiencing shortness of breath that does not heal even with adequate rest  Drowsiness, weakness, irritability and fatigue    Loss of appetite     These Harmful Complications Might Occur If You Dont Treat the Condition ASAP Having a potential case of bronchitis treated as soon as possible is vital. There are certain complications that could arise and negatively affect your and your childs health if not acted upon immediately. Pregnant women who have bronchitis may experience breathing difficulties. The disease results in ineffective oxygen intake into the lungs since the bronchial walls have been inflamed. Because of this, the oxygen  in your body is depleted, making you breathe lesser than the optimal required levels and lowering the necessary oxygen supply sent to the baby.5 Appetite loss typically occurs among all types of people when they are sick, pregnant women included. Unfortunately, this could be detrimental to the babys growth and overall health, since eating less decreases the amount of nutrients that the baby can get from the mother.6 Should you or someone you know breathe in fumes or smoke during pregnancy, this could not only exacerbate existing inflammation in the lungs and lead to chronic bronchitis, but also put your baby at risk of complications such as:7,8     Lower birth weight: Smoking an average of one pack of cigarettes per day during pregnancy slashes half a pound from the babys birth weight. If a woman smokes two packs a day, the babys birth weight is decreased by 1 pound or more.    Underdeveloped lungs and breathing problems: Babies born to mothers who smoke may have bodies that are underdeveloped during pregnancy, which affects their lungs and other organs. Babies may require respirator use for days or weeks to help them breathe properly and ensure optimal lung function.  Plus, even if they are able to breathe on their own, a child can still experience breathing problems.     Higher risk for asthma or sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS).    Heart defects: A baby is more likely to have a heart defect at birth if the mother smoked during the first trimester of pregnancy.    Impaired brain function: Its said that learning disorders, behavioral problems and a relatively low IQ may be present among babies whose mothers smoked while pregnant.    Placental abruption: Severe cases of a respiratory disease like bronchitis is associated with placental abruption, or the separation of the placenta from the uterus prior to delivery. Smoking during pregnancy is a known risk factor of this condition.9    Bronchitis during pregnancy could also swiftly progress to a severe respiratory disease like pneumonia or cause a low-grade fever to occur along with the disease. Either way, these sicknesses, especially if they reach high temperatures, could be bad for the babys health.10 Should you become affected with pneumonia during pregnancy, there is a higher risk for preterm birth, serious maternal complications such as respiratory failure and low birth weight for the baby.11 Dehydration may also occur because the mother is not taking enough fluids, which could lead to contractions that can cause preterm labor. A higher risk for complications like spina bifida (a birth defect wherein a babys spine is not formed normally12) or even death may also result because of bronchitis.13 < Previous Bronchitis in Children Next > Bronchitis Prevention   Previous Bronchitis in Children   Next Bronchitis Prevention [+] Sources and References      1,4,5,6,7,13Malachi, 3 Causes & 5 Risk Factors Of Bronchitis During Pregnancy, Mom Junction, July 26, 20162Worrall, G.

Top Superfoods to Eat When You're Pregnant,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/11/02/top-pregnancy-foods.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  There is rarely a more nutritionally demanding time during a woman's life than pregnancy (and later breastfeeding), when your intake of nutrients from foods and supplements are needed not only to keep your body running, but also to nourish and support your rapidly growing baby.   Proper nutrition is crucial at all stages of fetal development (and even before conception), and if mom doesn't eat right, her growing baby won't either. For a succinct and easy-to-follow overview of the types of foods and nutrients that will support a healthy pregnancy, read my optimized nutrition plan.   Ideally, by the time you enter pregnancy, you will already be in the Intermediate or Advanced stage, but even the Beginner stage is far better that the typical American diet. As you'll see, it is focused on minimizing processed foods while increasing your intake of vegetables, healthy fats, and high-quality sources of protein, all of which are ideal for nurturing a growing fetus.   If you're wondering about specific foods, see below for some of the top superfoods to eat when you're pregnant.  10 Top Foods to Eat When You're Pregnant   1. Vitamin D   Vitamin D isn't a food but rather is made by your body in response to sunlight exposure. It's so important, however, that it deserves to be number one on this list.   Raising vitamin D levels among pregnant women is of particular concern, as deficiency affects not only the mother, increasing her risk of complications during pregnancy or delivery, but also has short- and long-term ramifications for her child's health.   I firmly believe optimizing your vitamin D during pregnancy is one of the most important things you can do for the health of your child. When a child is born deficient in vitamin D, his or her health can be significantly affected in any number of ways.  Research confirms there is a lifelong impact of vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy ranging from childhood allergies to asthma, colds and flu, dental cavities, diabetes, and even strokes and cardiovascular disease in later life of the child.   Further, each year, more than half a million preemies are born, and it's the number one killer of newborns. It's also the second leading cause of death among children under the age of five. Research shows that vitamin D could likely prevent half of all these premature births.  It can also cut your risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and prenatal infections by approximately 50 percent. Among African-American and Hispanic populations, approximately 70 to 75 percent of all preterm births could be prevented with vitamin D optimization. Vitamin D screening is key.  This is the only way to determine whether you might be deficient or not, and regular testing is important to make sure whatever dosage of vitamin D you're taking is sufficient to reach clinically relevant levels. GrassrootsHealth, which has a panel of 42 researchers who provide scientific evidence, recommends maintaining a vitamin D blood serum level of 40 to 60 ng/ml to protect your and your baby's health.  However, according to previous studies, your levels need to be above 50 ng/ml to protect your baby from serious complications, such as premature delivery and preeclampsia.1 So please, if you're pregnant, make sure to get your 25-hydroxy D levels checked.  While optimizing your vitamin D through sensible sun exposure is best, if this isn't possible Dr. Bruce Hollis' research indicates that 50 percent of women can achieve this level with 4,000 IUs daily during pregnancy and 6,400 IUs (for nursing mothers) of vitamin D3 on a daily basis. Again, you'll need to have your vitamin D levels tested to be sure you're within the optimal range.  2. Organic Free-Range Eggs   Eggs are a phenomenal source of protein, fat, and other nutrients, including choline and the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin. In pregnant women, choline plays an important role helping to prevent certain birth defects, such as spina bifida, and playing a role in brain development.   Prior research has concluded that choline intake during pregnancy ""super-charged"" the brain activity of animals in utero, indicating that it may boost cognitive function, improve learning and memory, and even diminish age-related memory decline and the brain's vulnerability to toxins during childhood, as well as conferring protection later in life.2  Consumption of higher levels of choline during pregnancy (about double the recommended pregnancy intake) is linked to beneficial epigenetic changes in the fetus, including protection from stress-related and metabolic disorders, that likely last into adulthood.3  3. Wild-Caught Alaskan or Sockeye Salmon, Sardines    Fish has always been the best source for the animal-based omega-3 fats EPA and DHA, but as levels of pollution have increased you have to be very choosy about which types of seafood you decide to eat  especially when you're pregnant.  If you're not careful, the toxic effects from the pollutants in the fish will outweigh the benefits of the omega-3 fats. Among the safest in terms of contamination, and the highest in healthy omega-3 fat, is wild-caught Alaskan and sockeye salmon.   Neither is allowed to be farmed, and are therefore always wild-caught. The risk of sockeye accumulating high amounts of mercury and other toxins is reduced because of its short life cycle, which is only about three years.   Additionally, bioaccumulation of toxins is also reduced by the fact that it doesn't feed on other, already contaminated, fish. The two designations you want to look for on the label are: ""Alaskan salmon"" (or wild Alaskan salmon) and ""Sockeye salmon.""   Canned salmon labeled ""Alaskan salmon"" is also a reasonable choice and offers a less expensive alternative to salmon fillets. A general guideline is that the closer to the bottom of the food chain the fish is, the less contamination it will have accumulated, so other safer choices include smaller fish like sardines, anchovies, and herring.   Sardines, in particular, are one of the most concentrated sources of omega-3 fats. They also contain a wealth of other nutrients, from vitamin B12 and selenium to protein, calcium, and choline, making them one of the best dietary sources of animal-based omega-3s. You can also supplement your diet with animal-based omega-3s by taking a krill oil supplement.   4. Full-Fat Grass-Fed Dairy   Whole dairy products made from grass-fed raw milk are a rich source of healthy fats, protein, calcium, B vitamins, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, and more. Grass-fed raw butter, milk, and cheese from high-quality sources are all beneficial. Raw organic milk from grass-fed cows not only contains beneficial bacteria that prime your immune system and can help reduce allergies, it's also an outstanding source of vitamins (especially vitamin A), zinc, enzymes, and healthy fats. Your absolute best bet when it comes to yogurt is to make your own using a starter culture and raw grass-fed milk, which you combine and leave at room temperature overnight.  By the time you wake up in the morning, you will likely have kefir (fermented milk). If it hasn't obtained the consistency of yogurt, you might want to set it out a bit longer and then store it in the fridge. If you want to sweeten up your homemade yogurt naturally, try adding in some whole berries or dried (unsweetened) coconut.    5. Sweet Potatoes   Orange-colored sweet potatoes owe their appearance to the carotenoid beta-carotene. As an antioxidant, beta-carotene can help ward off free radicals that damage cells through oxidation, which can speed up aging and make you vulnerable against chronic diseases.   This antioxidant can help support your immune system, as well as lower your risk of heart disease and cancer. It's also very important during pregnancy, as it's converted into vitamin A in your body.   Vitamin A is essential for fetal health and development, but high levels of animal-based vitamin A may cause toxicity, making beta-carotene an ideal alternative. Sweet potatoes are also an excellent source of fiber, which can help support healthy blood sugar levels and improve digestion.   6. Broccoli and Leafy Greens  Broccoli and dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale are loaded with important nutrients for pregnant women, including folate, fiber, potassium, calcium, iron, and vitamins C, K, and A. Their rich antioxidant content will also support your immune system health and digestion, while their fiber can help prevent constipation, which is a common problem in pregnant women.  7. Grass-Fed Beef and Pasture-Raised Chicken   Grass-fed beef is an excellent source of protein and other nutrients in high demand during pregnancy, like iron, choline, and B vitamins. Chicken is an excellent source of protein, B vitamins, selenium, phosphorus, and choline. It provides all B vitamins along with a surprisingly varied number of additional nutrients.   8. Berries  Berries contain concentrated amounts of the disease-fighting phytochemicals found to boost your immunity, prevent cancer, protect your heart, and prevent seasonal allergies. Berries are lower in sugar than many fruits, so they are less likely to destabilize your insulin levels. Berries also contain high amounts of vitamin C, which will help your body absorb iron, and a good amount of fiber.  9. Avocados  Avocados provide close to 20 essential health-boosting nutrients, including potassium, vitamin E, vitamin K, B vitamins, and folate. They're also one of few foods that contain significant levels of both vitamins C and E and are an excellent source of healthy monounsaturated fat. Avocados are even high in fiber, with about 4.6 grams in half an avocado. Fiber plays an essential role in your digestive, heart, and skin health, and may improve blood sugar control, and more, so when you eat avocados you're really providing your body  and your baby  with a comprehensive package of nutrition.  10. Chia Seeds  Chia seeds are a quick and easy-to-use source of protein, healthy fats, dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants, all rolled into one neat package. Although they have similar health benefits to flax seeds, chia seeds may soon edge these out because they don't have to be ground prior to consumption, and they don't go rancid as quickly either. Their high concentration of the plant-based omega-3 fat alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is one of their major claims to fame. Chia seeds contain up to 40 percent oil, with 60 percent comprised of plant-based omega-3.4   New Benefits Revealed for a High-Fiber Diet During Pregnancy  A fiber-rich diet is recommended for most adults, but ramping up your fiber intake may be especially beneficial during pregnancy. Researchers from the Department of Immunology at Monash University in Australia revealed that a high-fiber diet may beneficially alter a woman's gut bacteria during pregnancy, producing anti-inflammatory substances that suppress asthma-related genes in her baby.5,6 Mounting research also suggests that a high-fiber diet can help reduce your risk of premature death from any cause, likely because it helps to reduce your risk of a number of chronic diseases.  This includes type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Studies have also linked a high-fiber diet to beneficial reductions in blood pressure, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced inflammation  all of which can benefit your baby. The best way to increase your fiber intake during pregnancy is to focus on eating more vegetables, nuts, and seeds. The following whole foods, for example, contain high levels of both soluble and insoluble fiber.     Psyllium seed husk, flax hemp, and chia seeds  Berries  Vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts    Root vegetables and tubers, including onions, sweet potatoes, and jicama Almonds Peas   Green beans Cauliflower Beans    Gaining Too Much Weight During Pregnancy Linked to Children's Obesity   Healthy weight gain is important and expected during pregnancy, but women who are overweight before pregnancy, and those who gain too much weight while pregnant, may be putting their babies at risk of childhood obesity. Researchers followed more than 700 women who returned for follow up with their children were 7 years old. Children of mothers who had been overweight prior to pregnancy were more likely to be overweight.   Women with greater weight gain during pregnancy were also more likely to have children with a higher percentage of body fat, and those with excessive weight gain were nearly three times more likely to have obese children than those who did not gain weight excessively during pregnancy.7 The Institute of Medicine recommends women of average weight gain 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy, while overweight women should gain 15 to 25 pounds and obese women gain just 11 to 20 pounds.8   More Risks Revealed for Lack of Vitamin D During Pregnancy  From my perspective, it is simply reprehensible malpractice for a health care professional to fail to address your vitamin D level if you're pregnant  it's just that important. For pregnant women, optimizing your vitamin D is even more important for your child's health and development than folate, which is routinely recommended for pregnant women.  Recent research shed even more light on what's at stake if your vitamin D levels are low during pregnancy. One study revealed that women with low levels of vitamins D and E in early pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of asthma in her child within the first 10 years of life.9 Separate research found newborns of mothers whose diets were deficient in vitamins D and E had airway cells that reacted more to irritants and allergens.10 This may, in turn, impact the development of asthma or allergies later in life. Separate research also added to past data linking low vitamin D levels during pregnancy with premature birth. Women with the lowest levels of vitamin D were 1.5 times more likely to deliver early than those with the highest levels, perhaps because vitamin D helps reduce bacterial infection in the placenta, which may trigger early delivery.11 Along with reducing your risk of premature birth, studies have found that vitamin D may protect against a number of birth defects and autism, as well as pregnancy complications like high blood pressure. It is absolutely imperative that pregnant women maintain a blood level of between 50 and 70 ng/ml of 25-hydroxy D, and I am hopeful that in the not too distant future it will be mandatory for pregnant women to receive regular vitamin D blood test levels.   Dad's Diet Matters for Baby's Health, Too  It's not only mom's diet that influences the future health of her offspring. A father's diet prior to conception may also play a role, particularly in regard to folate. An animal study showed that paternal folate deficiency was associated with an increase in birth defects in offspring compared to fathers eating a folate-sufficient diet. There was, in fact, a nearly 30 percent increase in birth defects, including severe skeletal abnormalities, among litters sired by fathers who were deficient in folate. The Epoch Times reported:12   ""The research shows that there are regions of the sperm epigenome that are sensitive to life experience and particularly to diet. And that this information is in turn transferred to a so-called epigenomic map that influences development and may also influence metabolism and disease in the offspring in the long term. The epigenome is like a switch, which is affected by environmental cues, and is involved in many diseases including cancer and diabetes.   The epigenome influences the way that genes are turned on or off and hence how heritable information gets passed along. Although it has been known for some time that there is a massive erasure and re-establishment that takes place in the epigenome as the sperm develops, this study shows that along with the developmental map, the sperm also carries a memory of the father's environment and possibly even of his diet and lifestyle choices.""   If You're Planning to Have Children, the Time to Start Eating Right Is Now   If you're a woman (or a man) in your childbearing years and you're planning to have children any time soon, it's imperative that you start eating healthy now. Research published in 2013 showed that women who ate a vegetable-rich diet during the year before pregnancy had a significantly lower risk of having a baby with certain birth defects compared to women who ate an unhealthy high-sugar diet.13 Specifically, compared to those who ate unhealthy, women on a healthy diet experienced:  One-half  lower risk of anencephaly, a neural-tube defect that interferes with brain  development and often results in miscarriage  Up  to a one-third lower risk of cleft lip  One-quarter  lower risk of cleft palate  One-fifth  lower risk of spina bifida, another neural-tube defect   Finally, one additional food group that hasn't yet been mentioned, but is crucially important for pregnant women, is fermented foods. Nearly everyone can benefit from the beneficial microbes in fermented vegetables, but if you are pregnant or planning to be, this is of utmost importance to you and your new baby. Research shows giving pregnant women and newborns doses of good bacteria like those found in fermented vegetables may:    Radically reduce your child's risk of developing autism or autism-like disordersProtect babies from developing eczema in childhoodHelp prevent childhood allergies  Help optimize your baby's weight later in lifeImprove the symptoms of colic, decreasing average crying times by about 75 percentReduce your risk of premature labor   For more detailed healthy pregnancy guidelines, please review my special report: ""No-Nonsense Guide to a Naturally Healthy Pregnancy and Baby,"" which covers far more than the basic nutrition tips offered here.

Study: Pregnant Women Aren't Getting Enough Omega-3,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/04/27/omega-3-pregnant-women.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Omega-3 fats are known as essential fatty acids because the only way you can get them is via your diet. In pregnant women, consuming enough omega-3 fats is especially important, as theyre important for the babys visual and cognitive development. In the US, most Americans diets are seriously lacking in omega-3 fats. Women tend to become further depleted during pregnancy, as the fetus uses omega-3s for nervous system development. After birth, omega-3s are again used to make breast milk, and for women on their second or third pregnancy, levels may be extremely low. Generally, with each subsequent pregnancy, women become further depleted in omega-3s.1 New research from the University of Alberta and the University of Calgary in Canada further confirmed that most pregnant women are seriously lacking in these beneficial fats.  Most Pregnant or Breastfeeding Women Arent Getting Enough Omega-3s  The American Dietetic Association and Dietitians of Canada recommend that pregnant and lactating women (along with all adults) consume at least 500 milligrams (mg) of omega-3s, including eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), daily.  The European Commission recommends that pregnant and lactating women consume a minimum of 200 mg of DHA, in particular, per day.2 In a study of more than 2,000 women, the majority did not meet these recommendations. In fact, only 27 percent of pregnant women and 25 percent of women at three months postpartum met the EUs DHA recommendation.3 Overall, 79 percent of the omega-3s in the womens diets came from seafood, fish, and seaweed products, with the majority from salmon, however this often wasnt enough to provide therapeutic levels of omega-3s that are critical for infant development.  Health Canada recommends pregnant women consume one to two portions a week of fish high in omega-3 fats to help increase levels. The study also found that women taking an animal-based omega-3 fat supplement were much more likely to meet the recommendations.  Women who took a supplement containing DHA were 10.6 and 11 times more likely to meet the current EU consensus recommendation for pregnancy and postpartum, respectively. The researchers noted, taking a supplement significantly improved the likelihood that they would meet recommendations. Unfortunately, nearly half (44 percent) of the women who reported taking an omega-3 fat supplement during pregnancy were no longer doing so while breastfeeding at three months postpartum, a period of crucial development for the infant.  The researchers recommended nutritional counseling and education to help women understand that the omega-3 supplement offers continued benefits during breastfeeding and should be continued beyond pregnancy.  The Importance of Omega-3 Fats During Pregnancy  It's important to realize that your body cannot form omega-3 fats, so a fetus must obtain all of its omega-3 fats from his mother's diet. Hence, a mother's dietary intake and plasma concentrations of DHA directly influence the DHA status of the developing fetus, which can impact your child's brain development. Research has linked inadequate intake of omega-3 fats in pregnant women to premature birth, increased risk of preeclampsia, and low birth weight, in addition to hyperactivity in children. Adding EPA and DHA to the diet of pregnant women has also been found to benefit visual and cognitive development in the baby, while also reducing the risk of allergies in infants.4 After delivery and while breastfeeding, omega-3 fats continue to be important, both for baby and for mom. In women, low levels of omega-3 are linked to an increased risk of postpartum depression.5 In children, supplementation early in life increases intelligence. In one study, a group of infants received either an omega-3 fat supplement or a placebo.6 Tests to evaluate their cognition were given every six months starting at age 18 months and continuing until they were 6 years old. While no changes were noted in the early test done at 18 months, the study found that infants consuming omega-3 fats outscored the placebo group later, between 3 and 5 years old. The omega-3 fat group scored higher on rule learning, vocabulary, and intelligence testing, which suggests early omega-3 fat supplementation, during the key period when your childs brain is still developing, may pay off with greater intelligence in the pre-school and school-aged years. Omega-3 levels even appear to influence sleep in children. Children taking daily supplements of omega-3 fats had nearly one hour more sleep and seven fewer waking episodes per night compared with children taking a placebo.7  Should Pregnant Women Eat Fish?  Fish has always been one of the best sources for the animal-based omega-3 fats EPA and DHA, but as levels of pollution have increased, this treasure of a food has become less and less viable as a primary source of healthy fats.  The good news is that about 70 percent of tested wild-caught fish consumed in the US contain relatively low levels of mercury.8 However, fish like tuna, marlin, shark, barracuda, and swordfish have some of the highest levels of contamination.  So while consuming fish can certainly be beneficial, pregnant women in particular should be sure to choose the right kinds of fish to receive maximum benefits with minimal exposure to pollutants like mercury.  Mercury can cross the placenta to harm the rapidly developing nervous system in your baby, including the brain. Studies have associated prenatal methylmercury exposure with impaired development of sensory, motor, and cognitive functions, resulting in learning difficulties, poor coordination, and inability to concentrate.  About 10 percent of the US populationincluding many children, pregnant women, and women of childbearing age, in particularhave mercury levels above the levels currently recommended for fetal and child health.  The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) are in the process of updating the national advisory for fish consumption for pregnant women, nursing mothers, women of childbearing age, and young children. They now recommend pregnant women eat 8 to 12 ounces of a variety of fish each week from choices that are lower in mercury.  Tuna Is a Large Source of Mercury Exposure   They recommend avoiding high-mercury fish including tilefish from the Gulf of Mexico, shark, swordfish, and king mackerel, and limiting white (albacore) tuna to 6 ounces a week. The lower mercury fish choices they recommend include salmon, shrimp, pollock, tilapia, catfish, cod and, unfortunately, tuna (light canned).  Tuna is one of the largest sources of mercury exposure in Americans diets, and anyone who wants to reduce their mercury intake probably needs to eat less of it. Research published in 2010, which quantified the contributions to total mercury in the US seafood supply by 51 different varieties of fish and shellfish, found that tuna was responsible for more than one-third of Americans' total exposure to methylmercury.9 According to the author:   ""The analysis performed here identifies the relative importance of different fish and shellfish as sources of mercury in the US seafood supply and proposes improved consumer advice, so that the public can benefit from fish consumption while minimizing mercury exposure.   Except for swordfish, most fish with the highest mercury levels are relatively minor contributors to total inputs. Tuna (canned light, canned albacore, and fresh/frozen varieties) accounts for 37.4 percent of total mercury inputs, while two-thirds of the seafood supply and nine of the 11 most heavily consumed fish and shellfish are low or very low in mercury.Substantial improvement in risk communication about mercury in fish and seafood is needed; in particular, several population subsets need better guidance to base their seafood choices more explicitly on mercury content.""   Further, a 2012 report by the Mercury Policy Project offers risk management advice for schools and parents, and warns that canned tuna is a major source of mercury exposure in children, which has implications for pregnant women as well.10Based on average contamination levels in tested samples, small children should eat light tuna no more than twice a month, according to the Mercury Policy Project, and albacore tuna should be avoided entirely.  Which Fish Are the Best Sources of Omega-3 Fats?   In addition to contamination concerns, the tuna population has also been decimated due to over-fishing, so I believe it is best to avoid tuna and make better choices when consuming seafood. Wild-caught Alaskan salmon, for example, is one very low mercury fish. Farmed salmon may contain only about half of the omega-3 of wild salmon and may also contain harmful contaminants, including environmental toxins, synthetic astaxanthin, and genetically engineered organisms from the grain feed theyre given  so choosing wild-caught Alaskan is important.  Unfortunately, salmon are often mislabeled. Studies have shown that as much as 70 percent to 80 percent of the fish marked ""wild"" are actually farmed. Avoid Atlantic salmon, as typically salmon labeled ""Atlantic Salmon"" currently comes from fish farms.The two designations you want to look for are: Alaskan salmon, and sockeye salmon, as Alaskan sockeye is not allowed to be farmed. So canned salmon labeled ""Alaskan Salmon"" is a good bet, and if you find sockeye salmon, it's bound to be wild.Cod and catfish, while lower in mercury, also primarily come from aquatic fish farms these days, so arent one of the best options.Other fish with short life cycles also tend to be better alternatives in terms of fat content, so its a win-win situation  lower contamination risk and higher nutritional value. A general guideline is that the closer to the bottom of the food chain the fish is, the less contamination it will have accumulated. This includes:  Sardines Anchovies  Herring   Sardines, in particular, are one of the most concentrated sources of omega-3 fats, with one serving containing more than 50 percent of your recommended daily value.11 In addition, look for fish that contains the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) label. The MSC label on wild-caught fish identifies seafood that is caught using sustainable, eco-friendly methods.   Whats the Optimal Source of Omega-3 Fats?   While a helpful form of omega-3 (ALA) can be found in flaxseed, chia, hemp, and a few other foods, the most beneficial form of omega-3 -- containing the two fatty acids DHA and EPA, which are essential to brain function -- can only be found in fish and krill. While your body can convert ALA into DHA/EPA, it only does so at a very low ratio, and only when sufficient enzymes (that many people are deficient in) are present. Youre probably aware that if you dont eat a lot of fish, you can supplement your diet with omega-3 fats with fish oil. Less widely known is that you can also get your omega-3s from krill oil, and it may, in fact, be preferable to do so.  The omega-3 in krill is attached to phospholipids that increase its absorption, which means you need less of it, and it won't cause belching or burping like many other fish oil products. Additionally, it naturally contains astaxanthin, a potent antioxidantalmost 50 times more than is present in fish oil. This prevents the highly perishable omega-3 fats from oxidizing before you are able to integrate them into your cellular tissue.   In laboratory tests, krill oil remained undamaged after being exposed to a steady flow of oxygen for 190 hours. Compare that to fish oil, which went rancid after just one hour. That makes krill oil nearly 200 times more resistant to oxidative damage compared to fish oil! When purchasing krill oil, you'll want to read the label and check the amount of astaxanthin it contains. The more the better, but anything above 0.2 mg per gram of krill oil will protect it from rancidity.   If you dont regularly eat safe forms of fish like wild Alaskan salmon or sardines, I recommend supplementing with krill oil before and during pregnancy, and while breastfeeding. Infants receive vital DHA through your breast milk, so if you can continue breastfeeding through at least the first year, you will give your child a great head start for success in life. Then, as soon as your child can safely swallow a capsule, he or she can start taking a high-quality krill oil supplement. The capsules should be kid-sized  about half the size of a regular capsule  and odor-free, making them easy and palatable for kids to swallow.

Why Pregnant Women Should Not Drink Coffee,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/02/03/coffee-in-pregnancy.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  In  recent years, research has emerged demonstrating that coffeein moderationmay  have a number of previously unrecognized health-promoting properties. As a result  of the rather impressive list of therapeutic benefits, I've modified my stance  on coffee. However, it's important to understand that coffee is both a  potent drug, and a whole food provided it's organically grown, and the drug  element of coffee can present problems for pregnant women.  Caffeine can significantly impact the growing fetus as it is  able to freely pass through the placenta, and since caffeine  does not provide any benefits to your  baby, only potential hazards, I strongly recommend pregnant women avoid ALL  forms of caffeine. Unfortunately, most people (pregnant or not) use coffee for its  energy-boosting properties, which ends up serving as a band-aid for poor  nutrition. If you're supplying your body with the nutrients it needs, you simply  won't need the extra energy boost.  If this sounds like you, you may want to consider taking a look at your  dietary habits. Proper nutrition clearly becomes even more important when  pregnant or planning a pregnancy.  Coffee in Pregnancy Tied to Smaller, Later Newborns  In a recent Norwegian study,1 which included data on nearly 60,000 women, coffee and other caffeinated  beverages increased the odds of delivering a low birth weight baby and/or  extended the gestation period.  Lead researcher Dr. Verena Sengpiel, an  obstetrician/gynecologist at the Sahlgrenska Academy of Sahlgrenska University  in Goteborg, Sweden, believes the current recommendations from the American  College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists should be re-evaluated. American  women are currently advised to limit their caffeine intake during pregnancy to  two cups of coffee per day.2 According to Dr. Sengpiel, this may be too much, even though  her observational study cannot prove a cause-and-effect between caffeine and  low birth weight. She told MedicineNet.com:   ""We cannot say from our data whether caffeine is the  specific substance responsible for the fetus being at greater risk of [becoming  a] low birth weight infant, nor did we study if these babies actually had  special health problems during the neonatal period.""   Still, higher caffeine consumption was found to be  associated with an increased risk for reduced birth weight. Every 100 mg of  caffeine consumed by the mother per day equated to a nearly one ounce reduction  in the baby's weight at birth. Every 100 mg of caffeine also increased the  length of the pregnancy by five hours. Interestingly, when the source of the  caffeine was coffee, the length of the pregnancy was extended by eight hours.  The reason for this difference is unknown. Seeing how your average cup of  coffee contains anywhere between 95-200 mg of caffeine, it may be best to err  on the side of caution. According to the featured article:3  ""Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician/gynecologist at Lenox Hill  Hospital in New York City, said, 'Other studies have indicated that  caffeine can affect fetal weight, so this is in accord with findings of other  studies.' Why caffeine might cause this effect is unclear, she said.   'We do know that caffeine crosses the placenta and the  baby is not able to metabolize it very well, [so] it may affect some of the  factors associated with growth,' Wu theorized. She advised that women  limit the amount of caffeine they consume during pregnancy. The World Health  Organization says 300 mg a day, but in the United States the recommended amount  is 200 mg a day, she added.""   Caffeine During Pregnancy May Damage Your Baby's Heart  Previous animal  research from 20094 found  that drinking the equivalent of just two cups of coffee while pregnant could be  enough to affect long-term heart function of the offspring. They also found  that this minimal exposure could lead to increased levels of body fat in males,  when compared to offspring not exposed to caffeine in the womb. Scott Rivkees,  Yale's Associate Chair of Pediatric Research and a senior researcher on the  study, told Medical News Today:5  ""Our studies raise  potential concerns about caffeine exposure during very early pregnancy, but further  studies are necessary to evaluate caffeine's safety during pregnancy.""  In the study,  mice given caffeine during pregnancy produced embryos with ""a thinner layer of  tissue separating some of the heart's chambers than the group that was not  given caffeine."" Long term, this resulted in a 20 percent increase in body fat  in males, and a 35 percent decrease in cardiac function. According to Gerald Weissman, M.D. and  editor-in-chief of the FASEB Journal:6   ""Caffeine is  everywhere: in what we drink, in what we eat, in pills that we use to relieve  pain, and even in candy... This report shows that despite popular notions of  safety, there's one place it probably shouldn't be: in the diet of an expectant  mother.""   When You're Eating for Two...  There is rarely a more nutritionally  demanding time during a woman's life than pregnancy (and later breastfeeding),  when your intake of nutrients from foods and supplements are needed not only to  keep your body running but also to nourish and support your rapidly growing baby.  Proper nutrition is crucial at all stages of fetal development, and if mom  doesn't eat right, her growing baby won't either. If  you're a woman in your childbearing years and you're planning to have children  any time soon, it's imperative that you start eating healthy now. Research7 published just last year showed that women who ate a vegetable-rich diet during  the year before pregnancy had a significantly lower risk of having a baby with  certain birth defects as women who ate an unhealthy high-sugar diet.  Specifically, compared to those who ate unhealthy, women on a healthy diet  experienced:  One-half  lower risk of anencephaly, a neural-tube defect that interferes with brain  development and often results in miscarriage  Up  to a one-third lower risk of cleft lip  One-quarter  lower risk of cleft palate  One-fifth  lower risk of spina bifida, another neural-tube defect   Unfortunately, the researchers lumped saturated  fats in with ""unhealthy fat,"" when they are actually crucial for  pregnant women (and everyone, for that matter), and incorrectly labeled whole  grains as healthy, when the majority of Americans need to limit them. So I  believe their results may have been skewed and may have shown an even greater benefit if a true  healthy diet had been defined.  Crucial Nutrients for Pregnant Women (and Women of Childbearing Age)  Healthy  nutrition cannot be limited to a handful of nutrients; it can only be achieved  by eating a variety of whole, high-quality foods daily. I cannot stress this  enough, as if you seek to make up for a diet of processed foods by taking a  multi-vitamin or eating a salad here and there, you are deceiving yourself and  missing the point -- and the benefits. For a  succinct and easy-to-follow overview of the types of foods and nutrients that  will support a healthy pregnancy, read my optimized nutrition plan.  Ideally, by the time you enter pregnancy you will already be in the Intermediate or Advanced stage, but even the Beginner  stage is far better that the typical American diet. As you'll see, it is  focused on minimizing processed foods while increasing your intake of  vegetables, healthy fats and high-quality sources of protein, all of which are  ideal for nurturing a growing fetus.  For  more detailed healthy pregnancy guidelines, please review my special report: ""No-Nonsense  Guide to a Naturally Healthy Pregnancy and Baby,"" which covers far more than  the basic nutrition tips offered here. Some of the highlights you'll want to be sure  to include though are:  Fermented Foods and/or Probiotics: Nearly everyone can  benefit from optimizing the balance of good vs. bad bacteria in their gut using  probiotics, but if you are pregnant or planning to be, this is of utmost  importance to you and your new baby. One of the best ways to do this is to  avoid sugar and processed foods and to include fermented foods in your diet.   Research shows giving pregnant women and newborns doses of good bacteria can:  Radically reduce the risk of developing autism or autism like disorders Protect babies from developing eczema in childhood Help prevent childhood allergies;8Help optimize your baby's weight later in life;9 Improve the symptoms of colic, decreasing average crying times by about 75  percent;10 reduce your risk of premature labor The best way to ensure optimal gut flora is to regularly consume traditionally  fermented foods, which are naturally rich in probiotics. This includes Lassi,  kefir, sauerkraut and other fermented veggies, natto, kim chee, and tempeh. A  high-quality probiotic supplement is also an option, especially if you don't  eat many fermented foods. Vitamin D: I've included vitamin  D here even though your main source of it should be from the sun, not from food. Along  with reducing your risk of premature birth, studies have found that vitamin D  may protect against a number of birth defects and autism, as well as pregnancy  complications like high  blood pressure. It is absolutely imperative that pregnant women maintain a  blood level of between 50 and 70 ng/ml of 25 hydroxy D, and I am hopeful  that in the not too distant future it will be mandatory for pregnant women to  receive regular vitamin D blood test levels. Vitamin B12: Vitamin B12 is one of  the eight B complex vitamins and is naturally present in foods that come from  animals, including meat, fish, eggs, milk and milk products. B12 is critical  for normal neurological development and maintenance, and shortages can result in permanent birth defects. Note: If you eat a vegan diet, you are  likely to be dangerously  deficient in vitamin B12. Folate in the form of Metafolate: Another B complex vitamin (vitamin B9), folic acid deficiency at the time of conception is known  to increase the risk for birth defects such as spina bifida.Many women are aware of this and take folic acid supplements in their prenatal  vitamins, but many are not aware that in order for folic acid to perform its crucial duties in your body, and for your fetus, it must first be activated into the biologically active  form  L-5-MTHF. This is the form that's most usable by your body and the form  that's able to cross the blood-brain barrier to carry out important brain  functions. Nearly half of the population has difficulty converting folic acid to the bioactive 5-MTHF form because of a genetic reduction in enzyme activity, so it's important to look for metafolate or metafolin in your multi-vitamin  instead of folic acid.Be sure to read the label closely, as many companies  don't use the bioactive form because it is too expensive and about 10 times  more costly.Of course even better than a supplement would be a wide variety of healthy,  fresh, organically grown vegetables, which will supply not only folic acid in  the correct form but all the other important accessory micronutrients. Animal-Based Omega-3 Fats: Most women have major  deficiencies of animal-based omega-3  fat like EPA and DHA, which is unfortunate because fetal cells cannot form  omega-3 fats, meaning a fetus must obtain all of its omega-3 fatty acids  from mother's diet. A mother's dietary intake and plasma concentrations of  DHA directly influence the DHA status of the developing fetus.    DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is so essential to a child's development that if a  mother and infant are deficient in it, the child's nervous system and immune  system may never fully develop, and it can cause a lifetime of unexplained  emotional, learning, and immune system disorders. DHA makes up 15 percent to 20  percent of the cerebral cortex and 30 percent to 60 percent of the retina so it  is absolutely necessary for normal development of the fetus in utero, and  as a baby post birth.  Studies have shown that sufficient levels of omega-3 fats optimize brain growth  in children, especially during the third trimester. But because the fetus  depends on the mother's DHA sources, the constant drain on a mother's DHA  reserves can easily lead to a deficiency and some researchers believe that  preeclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure) and postpartum depression  could be linked to a DHA deficiency. The DHA in animal-based omega-3 fats will  also help to prevent the vast majority of premature deliveries.   If You're NOT Pregnant, Keep These Coffee Drinking Tips in Mind  Getting  back to coffee, I believe there are ways to include coffee in a healthy  lifestyle, provided you're not using it as a crutch to mask symptoms of a poor  diet, resulting in flagging energy levelsand provided you're not pregnant. To learn more, see this previous article on the health benefits of coffee. That said, another major caveat to  coffee drinking is quality. You can  find a great deal of information at Coffee & Conservation.11  Here are five primary considerations to follow if you want to use coffee for  its therapeutic benefits:  Choose Organic: Coffee beans are one of the most heavily sprayed crops. So, you should select only coffee  beans that are certified organic and hence grown without pesticides. This is  important, as you will obliterate ANY positive effects if you consume coffee  that's been doused in pesticides or other chemicals. Whenever possible,  purchase sustainable ""shade-grown"" coffee to help prevent the  continued destruction of our tropical rain forests and the birds that inhabit  them. There are many who say shade grown coffee tastes better as well.  Whole Bean: You'll want to  purchase whole bean coffee that smells and tastes fresh, not stale; if your  coffee does not have a pleasant aroma, it is likely rancid. Grind it yourself to  prevent rancidity as pre-ground coffee may be rancid by the time you get it  home.  Drink It Black: If you're interested  in the health benefits, drink your coffee black, without sugar or cream or  flavorings. Add sugar and you'll certainly ruin any of the benefits by spiking  your insulin levels, which contributes to insulin resistance. Make sure the  water you're using is pure.  Coffee Filters: If you use a  ""drip"" coffee maker, be sure to use non-bleached filters. The bright  white ones are chlorine-bleached, and some of this chlorine will leach from the  filter during the brewing process. Bleached filters are also notoriously full  of dangerous disinfection byproducts, such as dioxin.  Coffee Mugs: Be careful about  the container you use. Avoid plastic cups as the BPA will leach into your drink. Styrofoam cups can also leach chemicals. Your best  bets include glass and ceramic travel mugs.   Again, remember that while coffee has the potential to be  used therapeutically, you need to view it as both a drug and a whole food. As  other drugs, caffeine can have a potent impact and should be respected and used  with caution. As a whole food, it needs to fulfill certain criteria. Much of  the commercial coffee available can be likened to ""junk food"" in that it's  loaded with pesticide residues and otherwise of poor quality... The most important caveat is to avoid coffee and other sources of caffeine during pregnancy. There  are far too many contraindications during this time, and plenty of evidence  that it can cause long-term harm.If you feel like you cannot drag yourself into work without one or more  cups of coffee, you may want to address your diet and exercise, which is at the  root of your fatigue. If you're supplying your body with the nutrients it  needs, you simply won't need the extra energy boost.

Should Pregnant Women Avoid Cell Phone Use?,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/02/23/should-pregnant-women-avoid-using-cell-phones.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Cell phones have been used widely for only about a decade, and unfortunately their use became commonplace before their true health effects were revealed. As a result, we are only now beginning to see the potential repercussions, which include a number of potential health concerns for adults, including brain tumors, cognitive impairment, DNA damage, fertility risks and more. Children, due to their thinner skulls, smaller brains, softer brain tissue and far more rapidly dividing cells, are even more susceptible to damage from cell phone use than adults, which suggests that babies in the womb, who are perhaps the most vulnerable population of all, may be at similar or greater at risk. In fact, new research sheds light on the impacts of chronic cell phone use on the fetal brain in animals, and the effects are clearly detrimental.  Cell Phone Use During Pregnancy Shown to Cause ""Certain Harm"" to Fetal Rat Brains  A new study in Electromagnetic Biology and Medicine by Jing et al sought to evaluate the intensity of oxidative stress and the levels of neurotransmitters in the brains of fetal rats chronically exposed to radiation from cell phones.  Four groups of pregnant rats were exposed to different intensities of cell phone microwave radiation -- one group that was left unexposed, and three groups that were irradiated three times daily for either 10, 30, or 60 minutes at a time. After three weeks, the fetal rats were examined for changes in their brains.  All of the irradiated groups exhibited significant neurological differences, with researchers noting:  ""Through this study, we concluded that receiving a certain period of microwave radiation from cellular phones during pregnancy has certain harm on fetal rat brains.""  Should Pregnant Women Avoid Cell Phones?  It will be a long time before these findings are thoroughly explored or publicized, but in the meantime there is reason to believe that cell phones could have a negative impact on a developing fetus, just as they may have a negative impact on you and your children. In 2008, researchers analyzed data from nearly 13,000 children and found that exposure to cell phones while in the womb, and also as children, was linked to more behavioral difficulties.i Pregnant women using handsets just two or three times a day was enough to raise the risk of their babies developing hyperactivity and difficulties with conduct, emotions and relationships by the time they reached school age -- and the risk became even greater if the children also used the phones themselves before age 7. The 2008 study revealed that mothers who used mobile phones were in fact 54 percent more likely to have children with behavioral problems. When the children also later used the phones themselves, they were:  80 percent more likely to suffer from difficulties with behavior  25 percent more at risk from emotional problems  34 percent more likely to suffer from difficulties relating to their peers  35 percent more likely to be hyperactive  49 percent more prone to problems with conduct    Behavioral Problems in Children Exposed to Cell Phones in Utero Confirmed  In 2010, the researchers then looked at a larger group of children -- nearly 29,000 -- and also considered additional variables that could be swaying the results, and the association was found once again.ii In that study, children whose mothers used cell phones while pregnant were 40 percent more likely to have behavioral problems, and this rose to 50 percent when the children also used cell phones themselves. The researchers even accounted for family history of behavioral problems, inattention of the mother, breastfeeding and time spent with the child -- and the association remained. Autonomic nervous system expert Dr. Dietrich Klinghardt has noted this radiation may easily flip certain genes in the mitochondria. If this gene sequence is altered in a pregnant woman, she can pass her damaged mitochondria on to her child. The child can then develop a mitochondrial disorder, which can include muscular atrophy and severe developmental problems.  UK Experts Call for Health Warnings for Cell Phones and Children  In a report published by Mobilewise, a UK charity, medical experts and Mobilewise call on government and industry to provide warnings and advice on ways to reduce the risk of health damage when using mobile phones, especially in order to protect children.  The report, ""Mobile Phone Health Risks: the case for action to protect children,"" warns that children's health is being put at risk by the failure of government and phone companies to respond to the growing body of evidence linking mobile phone use with health hazards.iii It includes a chart of more than 200 peer-reviewed studies from numerous research institutions that link mobiles to serious health problems.  These include brain tumors and impact on fertility, genes, the blood-brain barrier and melatonin production, as well as other biological effects thought to have a role in the development of cancer. Endorsed by a number of prominent doctors and scientists, the Mobilewise report on the public health issue related to the impact on children highlights the body of evidence that has been ""obscured in the debate over these risks,"" according to Vicky Fobel, director of Mobilewise. I encourage you to read this report, and to print the list of studies with summaries and links to the cited research, and to share these with your communities.  ""  develop within different ministries (education, environment and health) targeted information campaigns aimed at teachers, parents and children to alert them to the specific risks of early, ill-considered and prolonged use of mobiles and other devices emitting microwaves  "" ban all mobile phones, DECT phones or WiFi or WLAN systems from classrooms and schools, as advocated by some regional authorities, medical associations and civil society organizations""  The European Parliament has also called for schools to be wireless free, in addition to hospitals, day care and retirement living facilities.iv And most recently, Russian researchers led by Yury Grigoriev, PhD of the Russian National Committee on Non-Ionizing Radiation Protection have demonstrated significant cognitive impairment in children after four years of exposure to wireless devices.v Dr. Grigoriev says:   ""The short-term and long-term potential consequences for society from exposing children to microwave radiation from cellular communication devices must be immediately acknowledged, globally, and responsibly addressed.""  My Top Tips for Cell Phone Safety  It's worth remembering that the telecommunication industry is much larger than the medical industrial complex, and they have far more influence than the drug companies. They're also mirroring many of the same tactics as the tobacco industry to pedal their wares. This includes attempting to discredit researchers who publish unfavorable cell phone studies. According to Camilla Rees, MBA of ElectromagneticHealth.org:  ""We have seen a recent steep increase in disparagement of scientific research where the research demonstrates risks to public health from telecommunications technologies. It is very clear that in the name of ""debate"" certain parties are aggressively creating confusion and doubt about the biological and health risks, shamefully supporting the interests of the telecommunications industry.""  There is already robust scientific evidence that cell phones and other wireless devices pose significant health risks to all of us, and especially to children and pregnant women. So while these findings are not being widely publicized as of yet, it makes sense to take action now to protect yourself and your children. You can help to minimize your exposure to electromagnetic radiation from cell phones and other wireless devices by heeding the following advice:   Children Should Always Avoid Using Cell Phones: Barring a life-threatening emergency, children should not use a cell phone, or a wireless device of any type. Children are far more vulnerable to cell phone radiation than adults, because of their thinner skull bones.  Reduce Your Cell Phone Use: Turn your cell phone off more often. Reserve it for emergencies or important matters. As long as your cell phone is on, it emits radiation intermittently, even when you are not actually making a call. If you're pregnant, avoiding or reducing your cell phone use may be especially important.  Use a Land Line at Home and at Work: Although more and more people are switching to using cell phones as their exclusive phone contact, it is a dangerous trend and you can choose to opt out of the madness. SKYPE offers a portable number via your computer that can plug into any Ethernet port while traveling.  Reduce or Eliminate Your Use of Other Wireless Devices: You would be wise to cut down your use of these devices. Just as with cell phones, it is important to ask yourself whether or not you really need to use them as often as you do. And most importantly, do not even consider having any electronic or wireless devices in the bedroom that will interfere with the quality of your sleep.  If you must use a portable home phone, use the older kind that operates at 900 MHz. They are not safer during calls, but at least many of them do not broadcast constantly even when no call is being made. Note the only way to truly be sure if there is an exposure from your cordless phone is to measure with an electrosmog meter, and it must be one that goes up to the frequency of your portable phone (so old meters won't help much). As many portable phones are 5.8 Gigahertz, we recommend you look for RF meters that go up to 8 Gigahertz, the highest range now available in a meter suitable for consumers. Alternatively you can be very careful with the base station placement as that causes the bulk of the problem since it transmits signals 24/7, even when you aren't talking. So if you can keep the base station at least three rooms away from where you spend most of your time, and especially your bedroom, they may not be as damaging to your health. Another option is to just simply turn the portable phone off, only using it when you specifically need the convenience of moving about while on a call. Ideally it would be helpful to turn off your base station every night before you go to bed. You can find RF meters as well as remediation supplies at www.emfsafetystore.com. But you can pretty much be sure your portable phone is a problem if the technology is DECT, or digitally enhanced cordless technology.  Use Your Cell Phone Only Where Reception is Good: The weaker the reception, the more power your phone must use to transmit, and the more power it uses, the more radiation it emits, and the deeper the dangerous radio waves penetrate into your body. Ideally, you should only use your phone with full bars and good reception.  Also Seek to Avoid Carrying Your Phone on Your Body as that merely maximizes any potential exposure. Ideally put it in your purse or carrying bag. Placing a cell phone in a shirt pocket over the heart is asking for trouble, as is placing it in a man's pocket if he seeks to preserve his fertility.  Don't Assume One Cell Phone is Safer Than Another: There's no such thing as a ""safe"" cell phone.  Keep Your Cell Phone Away From Your Body When it is On: The most dangerous place to be, in terms of radiation exposure, is within about six inches of the emitting antenna. You do not want any part of your body within that area.  Respect Others Who are More Sensitive: Some people who have become sensitive can feel the effects of others' cell phones in the same room, even when it is on but not being used. If you are in a meeting, on public transportation, in a courtroom or other public places, such as a doctor's office, keep your cell phone turned off out of consideration for the 'second hand radiation' effects. Children are also more vulnerable, so please avoid using your cell phone near children.  If you are using the Pong case, which redirects the cell phone radiation away from the head and successfully lowers the SAR effect, realize that in redirecting the radiation away from your head this may be intensifying the radiation in another direction, perhaps toward the person next to you, or, if in your pocket, increasing radiation intensity toward your body. Caution is always advised in dealing with any radiation-emitting device. We recommend cell phones be kept 'Off' except for emergencies.  Use Safer Headset Technology: Wired headsets will certainly allow you to keep the cell phone farther away from your body. However, if a wired headset is not well-shielded -- and most of them are not -- the wire itself acts as an antenna attracting ambient radio waves and transmitting radiation directly to your brain.  Make sure that the wire used to transmit the signal to your ear is shielded. The best kind of headset to use is a combination shielded wire and air-tube headset. These operate like a stethoscope, transmitting the information to your head as an actual sound wave; although there are wires that still must be shielded, there is no wire that goes all the way up to your head.

The Amazing Benefits of Breastfeeding,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/01/02/amazing-benefits-breastfeeding.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Contrary to what infant formula companies want you to believe, infant formula cannot replace breast milk when it comes to protecting your baby's health and promoting healthy long-term development.   In fact, breastfeeding offers a long list of life-long health benefits not just for the baby but for mother as well.   Considering the fact that babies have been successfully raised on breast milk since the beginning of mankind, it stands to reason that breast milk is a perfect food in every way, providing a growing infant with everything it needs.  Modern science confirms this logic, and it is my hope that more women start reevaluating their choice to substitute breastfeeding with infant formulas.   Nursing even has health benefits beyond nutrition. As noted in the video above, breastfeeding helps expand your child's palate and allows his oral cavity to develop properly, which helps prevent breathing disorders such as snoring and sleep apnea, and all the health risks associated with such sleep disruptions.  Breast Milk Is a Complete Food    As noted in the featured article in The Stranger:1   ""Colostrum, the thick golden liquid that first comes out of a woman's breasts after giving birth ... is engineered to be low in fat but high in carbohydrates and protein, making it quickly and easily digestible ...  Mature breast milk, which typically comes in a few days after a woman has given birth, is 3 to 5 percent fat and holds an impressive list of minerals and vitamins: sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, and vitamins A, C, and E.   Long chain fatty acids like DHA (an omega-3) and AA (an omega-6)  both critical to brain and nervous-system development  also abound in mother's milk.   The principal carbohydrate in breast milk is lactose, which provides copious calories and energy to fuel babies' relentless round-the-clock growth ...   Other sugars are also present, including some 150 oligosaccharides ... complex chains of sugars unique to human milk ... These oligosaccharides can't be digested by infants; they exist to feed the microbes that populate a baby's digestive system.  And speaking of microbes, there's a ton of them in breast milk ... much like yogurt and naturally fermented pickles and kefir, that keep our digestive systems functioning properly.""   Besides healthy bacteria, breast milk is also loaded with nutrient growth factors that support the growth of beneficial bacteria, along with components that inhibit the growth of bad bacteria and yeast.   So breast milk really ""primes"" your baby's gut and promotes the colonization of a healthy microbiome. This, we now know, is critical for both short- and long-term health.   Another important nutrient in breast milk that is not found in infant formula is cholesterol, which provides other crucial components for the formation of healthy nerve tissues.   Breast Milk Offers Natural Immunity    As noted in the featured article,2 ""Not nearly enough people know about this mind-blowing characteristic of breast milk: It changes daily based on signals from the baby."" Indeed, it's not just vitamins, minerals, proteins, and fats that make breast milk far superior to formula.   For starters, breast milk also contains antibodies, or immune molecules, that provide the baby with natural immunity to illnesses that the mother is immune to. This is why breastfed babies tend to have far fewer colds than formula fed babies.  Breastfed babies also have fewer ear, respiratory, stomach, and intestinal infections than their formula-fed counterparts. Perhaps even more remarkable, when a newborn is exposed to a germ, he or she will transfer it back to the mother while nursing.   The mother will then make antibodies to that particular germ and transfer them back to the baby at the next feeding, thereby speeding up the recovery process and promoting future immunity toward the organism, should it be encountered again.  Breast milk also contains growth factors that significantly enhance your baby's gut and brain development, and even helps augment emotional perception and social development.3  It may also help prevent obesity later in life, and offers protection against diseases such as type 2 diabetes.   Variations in Breast Milk Linked to Differences in Infant Obesity   Previous research has shown that children of obese mothers have an increased risk of future obesity, but recent research4,5 suggests the composition of a mother's breast milk may be a far more significant factor, and it goes back to the oligosaccharides mentioned earlier.   Twenty-five pairs of mothers and infants were included in the study, which found that infant growth and obesity was linked to variations in the complex carbohydrates (milk oligosaccharides) in the mothers' milk.   At 6 months of age, children whose mother's milk contained higher levels of two particular oligosaccharides gained about 1 pound more body fat than those with lower levels. Other oligosaccharides were found to be protective against obesity at 6 months, with one particular oligosaccharide being associated with a 1-pound lower fat mass.   According to the authors of this study, individual breast milk composition was more predictive of infant obesity than maternal obesity and pregnancy weight gain. Oligosaccharides are complex carbohydrates unique to breast milk. Their primary function, besides providing energy for rapid growth, is to feed the microbes in your baby's digestive tract, and numerous studies have demonstrated that the makeup of your gut microbiome can have a significant bearing on your weight.  Please note that milk oligosaccharides are not found in infant formula. They're unique to breast milk. Sugars in breast milk and infant formula are NOT the same. Infant formulas typically have processed corn syrup and refined sugar as their largest ingredient, both of which are high in fructose. In fact, many infant formulas have as much sugar as a can of soda. Fructose has NONE of the benefits of lactose and comes with a long list of adverse metabolic effects.6   There is a good deal of evidence that the addition of fructose to virtually every processed food on grocery store shelves today, including infant formula, is largely responsible for the explosion of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Research published in the journal Diabetes Cares hows that formula-fed babies are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes as adolescents.7  Breast Milk Helps Protect Preemies Against Blindness   Breast milk may be particularly important for preemies. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is an eye disease that in 10 percent of severe cases causes blindness. More than half of preemies born before 30 weeks of gestation are afflicted, and up to 50,000 children around the globe go blind as a result of it each year. A recent analysis suggests this number could be reduced by more than 50 percent if all preemies were fed breast milk.   The analysis looked at five studies published between 2001 and 2013, and found that prematurely born babies who received their mother's milk had a 46 to 90 percent reduced risk of developing ROP. The wide gap was due to variations in the amount of milk they received, and how severe their condition was. As reported by NPR:8   ""Infants who exclusively received breast milk had 89 percent reduced odds of severe ROP compared to infants who received any formula. Infants who received a mixture of breast milk and formula had roughly half the odds of developing severe ROP compared to infants exclusively receiving formula.  The analysis included a very large older study that had found no reduced risk for ROP from breast milk, but most infants in that study received less than 20 percent breast milk.""   Breast milk has also been shown to reduce other complications associated with premature birth, including:  Necrotizing enterocolitis, a severe gastrointestinal disease Blood infections Lung disease    How Breastfeeding Benefits the Mother   In the short-term, nursing helps a woman shed that extra ""baby weight"" she put on during pregnancy. That alone is reason enough to breastfeed for many women, but the benefits go far beyond that. For example, recent research9 suggests breastfeeding may reduce a woman's risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. Starting in 1985, the cardiovascular risk factors in 846 women were recorded. Twenty years later, the women underwent ultrasound to measure the thickness of their carotid arteries. Thicker arteries are a risk factor for heart disease. As reported in The New York Times:10   ""After controlling for many other risk factors, including race, blood pressure, B.M.I., age, and cholesterol levels, they found that the less time a woman breastfed, the thicker her carotid arteries. In addition, almost 17 percent of women who lactated for a month or less had atherosclerotic plaques, compared with less than 11 percent of those who breastfed for 10 months or longer.   Pregnancy makes the cardiovascular system work harder, increasing the risk for cardiovascular disease, and the authors suggest that lactation helps restore maternal physiological systems to their pre-pregnancy state.""   Other studies11 have also shown breastfeeding benefits the mother by:      Enhancing maternal behavior through increased release of oxytocin, a hormone referred to as the ""love hormone,"" or ""bonding hormone""   Acting as a natural birth control, as it suppresses ovulation, making pregnancy less likelyReducing diabetic mothers' need for insulin, as lactation lowers glucose levels naturally     Reducing the risk of women with gestational diabetes from becoming lifelong diabetics.   In one recent study,12 a woman's risk of progressing from gestational diabetes to type 2 diabetes was inversely associated with length and intensity of breastfeeding   Reducing your risk of endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancers, including hormone receptor negative tumors,13 which are a very aggressive form of breast cancerReducing your risk of metabolic syndrome    New Moms Need More Support   Hospitals also need to do a better job when it comes to promoting breastfeeding, and supporting women who want, but may struggle, to nurse. While some women cannot, for a variety of reasons, breastfeed, most can. More often than not, they simply need a little bit of guidance and support. As noted in a recent CNN article,14 only 14 percent of babies born in the U.S. are born in hospitals offering breast-feeding support according to the global standard, which includes, but is not limited to, teaching nursing techniques and feeding cues, and allowing the father and baby to stay in the same room as the mother to facilitate round-the-clock nursing.   Perhaps even more egregious, most hospitals insist on giving infant formula to breastfed babies, sometimes against the mother's wishes, which can make breastfeeding more difficult. As a society (and employers especially), we really need to provide new moms with the support and the means to breastfeed. In some cases, it's a matter of knowing your rights. According to the Affordable Care Act, nursing mothers who work have the right to:  Reasonable break times to express breast milk during your work day, for up to one year after the birth of your child A private place to pump other than a bathroom   Do You Need Help Breastfeeding?     The majority of women are able to produce adequate supplies of milk and breastfeed successfully. One common misperception is that you're not producing enough milk. It's important to realize that the more your baby nurses, the more milk you will produce. This is why supplementing with formula can be detrimental to your milk supply. Nursing moms also need to drink plenty of water and seek optimal nutrition while nursing. The first few weeks and months are critical in the process.   You should begin nursing as soon after birth as possible, as your baby's sucking instinct will be very strong at that time, giving you the best chance of success. In the beginning, the milk that is produced is called colostrum  a thick, golden-yellow fluid that is very gentle for your baby's stomach and full of beneficial antibodies. As your baby continues to nurse, your milk will gradually change in color and consistency from thick and yellow, to thinner with a bluish-white hue.   Newborns need to nurse at least once every two hours, for about 15 minutes or so on each side, but most do not adhere to any kind of strict schedule and feedings can vary in length. It is this frequent nursing that stimulates your breasts to produce increasing amounts of milk to keep up with demand.   You may want to begin planning for successful breastfeeding before your baby is even born by taking a breastfeeding class while you're pregnant. La Leche League15 is a terrific resource to contact for help whether you want to prepare beforehand or find you're having trouble breastfeeding once your baby is born. Also find out whether your hospital of choice offers breastfeeding classes and lactation consultants who can help you. If it doesn't, you may want to select a hospital that offers greater support.  Healthier Alternatives to Infant Formula   I encourage you to do all you can to breastfeed your baby successfully, and exclusively, for at least the first six months; and longer if possible. This is one of the best gifts you can give to your child and the health benefits will last a lifetime. If you find yourself unable to breastfeed, or you have adopted your newborn, you may want to consider using donated breast milk. Unfortunately, there is a major downside to using breast milk from human milk banks that are now available in the U.S. The milk has been pasteurized, which means many of the essential immune-building elements will be decimated in the pasteurization process and your infant will fail to receive this crucial support when they need it the most.  So while human milk banks are a fantastic idea, the sad reality is that milk obtained from them  assuming it is pasteurized, as is standard process at most milk banks  is far inferior to breast milk that is unpasteurized. An alternative may be to work with a physician or pediatrician who is willing to help you find a safe milk donor, and who will be involved in a screening process to ensure the milk is safe. If you're unable to breastfeed or find a safe source of breast milk, your next best bet is to make your own infant formula. There may be others, but here is one recipe for homemade formula created by the Weston Price Foundation, which I believe is sound.  Please steer clear of commercial infant formulas as much as possible. They're far too high in refined sugar for optimal health, and sets your child on the path of craving sugar. Definitely avoid soy infant formula, as it is loaded with dangerously high levels of toxic elements like manganese and aluminum. Soy formula is among the absolute worst commercial foods you could give your baby. However, even milk-based infant formulas have been found to be contaminated with chemical additives (including some boasting the ""organic"" label), and is best avoided.

Benefits of Breastfeeding Your Child,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/04/02/breastfeeding-benefits.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Breastfeeding rates continue to rise in the US. In 2011, the most recent year for which data is available, 79 percent of newborn infants started breastfeeding.1 This is wonderful news, as breastfeeding offers life-long health benefits, not just for the child, but for the mother as well.  Many women do not have access to the truth about breastfeeding and have been misled by infant-formula marketing to believe they must spend thousands of dollars a year to provide the best nutrition for their babies. In reality (and barring any extreme exceptions such as certain transmittable diseases or drug use), breast milk is the best food for babies, period. As reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), breastfeeding is the normal way of providing infants with the nutrients they need to grow and develop. They continue:   Virtually all mothers can breastfeed, provided they have accurate information, and the support of their family, the health care system and society at large. Colostrum, the yellowish, sticky breast milk produced at the end of pregnancy, is recommended by WHO as the perfect food for the newborn, and feeding should be initiated within the first hour after birth.  Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended up to 6 months of age, with continued breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods up to two years of age or beyond.    Breastfed Babies Grow into More Successful Adults  Proper nutrition in infancy has lasting effects on health and well-being. A study of nearly 6,000 babies followed from birth until they turned 30 years old found that those who were breastfed had increased intelligence, longer schooling, and higher earning as adults.2 Specifically, when compared to children who breastfed for less than a month, children who were breastfed for at least 12 months grew into adults who:  Scored close to four points higher on IQ tests Attended school for a year longer Made 15 percent more money at the age of 30  The studys lead author, Dr. Bernardo Lessa Horta from the Federal University of Pelotas in Brazil, noted:3   ""Our study provides the first evidence that prolonged breastfeeding not only increases intelligence until at least the age of 30 years but also has an impact both at an individual and societal level by improving educational attainment and earning ability.   What is unique about this study is the fact that, in the population we studied, breastfeeding was not more common among highly educated, high-income women, but was evenly distributed by social class.   Previous studies from developed countries have been criticized for failing to disentangle the effect of breastfeeding from that of socioeconomic advantage, but our work addresses this issue for the first time.""   In the study, the longer the children were breastfed, the better they tended to be doing as adults. Horta mentioned that babies breastfed for six months appeared to get most of the benefits of those who had been breastfed longer, but suggested Mothers should breastfeed for as long as possible.4 In the US, while breastfeeding rates start out strong, many women do not continue as long as recommended. In 2011, only 49 percent of infants were still breastfeeding at six months, and this dropped to 27 percent at 12 months.5 For comparison, in Sweden more than 98 percent of women initiate breastfeeding at birth, and 72 percent are still breastfeeding at six months.6   Breastfeeding Could Save 800,000 Childrens Lives Each Year  Worldwide, less than 40 percent of infants under six months of age are exclusively breastfed. According to WHO, If every child was breastfed within an hour of birth, given only breast milk for their first six months of life, and continued breastfeeding up to the age of two years, about 800 000 child lives would be saved every year. They note multiple reasons why breastfeeding is one of the most effective ways to boost and support your childs health, including:7  Breast milk contains antibodies to protect your baby from childhood illnesses, including diarrhea and pneumonia Promotes sensory and cognitive development Lowers the risk of overweight and obesity into adolescence and adulthood Lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes Improves performance on intelligence tests  Breastfeeding offers benefits to mom, too, including a natural method of birth control (about 98 percent effective for the first six months). Women who breastfeed also have a lower risk of breast and ovarian cancer, lower rates of obesity and return to their pre-pregnancy weight faster.  By not breastfeeding, you and your baby miss out on these important benefits, which translates into increased risk of diseases and corresponding medical costs. One study estimated the increased medical costs of diseases caused by a lack of breastfeeding infants in their first six months of life to be $13 billion each year in the US alone. The researchers concluded:8   If 90% of US families could comply with medical recommendations to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months, the United States would save $13 billion per year and prevent an excess 911 deaths, nearly all of which would be in infants ($10.5 billion and 741 deaths at 80% compliance).   Studies have also shown that breastfed babies gain added protection against:     Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) EczemaRespiratory, ear, and other types of infections  Heart diseaseObesityType 1 and type 2 diabetes  Bowel diseases such as Crohn's diseaseAsthma and allergiesNecrotizing enterocolitis among premature babies     Breastfeeding Encourages Optimal Gut Health in Your Baby  Breastfeeding helps ensure that your child's gut flora develops properly right from the start, as breast milk is loaded both with beneficial bacteria and nutrient growth factors that will support their continued growth. It also has powerful components that will inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and yeast.  Emerging research shows that bacteria are absolutely vital for human health, and imbalances in the human microbiome significantly contribute to chronic non-transmissible diseases. This is no small concern. Many diseases are directly impacted by your microbiome, which is why it's so important to address your baby's gut health both during pregnancy and from birth.  Researchers are also starting to understand how a child's microbiome can play a role in autism. As noted by Scientific American:9   ""Scientists have long wondered whether the composition of bacteria in the intestines, known as the gut microbiome, might be abnormal in people with autism and drive some of these symptoms. Now a spate of new studies10 supports this notion and suggests that restoring proper microbial balance could alleviate some of the disorder's behavioral symptoms.""   Indeed, this is precisely what Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride surmised when she created the Gut and Psychology Syndrome (GAPS) Nutritional Program, which is designed to heal leaky gut by restoring the integrity of your gut lining. According to Dr. Campbell-McBride, in children with GAPS, toxicity flows from their gut throughout their bodies and into their brains. This continually challenges their nervous system, preventing it from performing its normal functions and process sensory information. One of the most important foundational elements of building a healthy gastrointestinal system for your child is to first eat a healthy, probiotic-rich diet while you're pregnant, and then breastfeed after your child is born.   Do You Need Help Breastfeeding?   As the benefits of breastfeeding are beginning to be more widely recognized, at least in the US, there has been a growing stigma against moms who formula-feed their babies. If youre a formula-feeding mom, please dont feel attacked or judged! The information Ive compiled here is meant to empower women with the information they need to make healthy choices. There are certain medical conditions that can prevent a woman from breastfeeding, however the majority of women are able to produce adequate supplies of milk and breastfeed successfully.  Often, those who believe they cannot may be misinformed, and believe they don't have enough milk; this is a common misperception. However, in the vast majority of circumstances, all women have enough milk to breastfeed. The more the baby nurses, the more milk you will produce! Mom needs to drink plenty of water and seek optimal nutrition while nursing. The beginning weeks and months are critical in the process. As the La Leche League states:11   ""Some mothers need to know that they will be able to breastfeed their babies in less than ideal or special circumstances. For example, many mothers have been able to provide their own milk for their premature or ill babies. Many mothers also continue to breastfeed after returning to work and, in most cases, provide sufficient milk.  In other cases, because of lack of knowledge or a poor start, a mother may be in a situation where her body is not producing enough milk. Increasing frequency of nursing, making sure the baby is latched on correctly, and offering both breasts at each feeding are some of the proven techniques that help most nursing mothers increase their supply.""   You should begin nursing as soon after birth as possible, as your baby's sucking instinct will be very strong at that time, giving you the best chance of success. In the beginning, the milk that is produced is called colostrum -- a thick, golden-yellow fluid that is very gentle for your baby's stomach and full of beneficial antibodies. As your baby continues to nurse, your milk will gradually change in color and consistency from thick and yellow, to thinner with a bluish-white hue.  Newborns need to nurse at least once every two hours, for about 15 minutes or so on each side, but most do not adhere to any kind of strict schedule and feedings can vary in length. It is this frequent nursing that stimulates your breasts to produce increasing amounts of milk to keep up with demand. You may want to begin planning for successful breastfeeding before your baby is even born by taking a breastfeeding class while you're pregnant. La Leche League is a terrific resource to contact for help whether you want to prepare beforehand or find you're having trouble breastfeeding once your baby is born. But even many hospitals offer breastfeeding classes and lactation consultants who can help you.   Are There Healthy Alternatives to Breast Milk?   If you are a woman who is unable to breastfeed, or you have adopted your newborn, you may want to consider using donated breast milk. Unfortunately, there is a major downside to using breast milk from human milk banks that are now available in the US. The milk has been pasteurized, which means many of the essential immune-building elements will be decimated in the pasteurization process and your infant will fail to receive this crucial support when they need it the most.  So while human milk banks are a fantastic idea, the sad reality is that milk obtained from them -- assuming it is pasteurized, as is standard process at most milk banks -- is far inferior to breast milk that is unpasteurized. An alternative option to obtain unpasteurized breast milk straight from a donor may be to work with a physician or pediatrician who will work with you to find a safe milk donor, and will be involved in a screening process to ensure the milk is safe. If you're unable to breastfeed or find a safe source of breast milk, please steer clear of commercial infant formulas as much as possible and definitely avoid all soy infant formula, as it is loaded with toxic elements like high doses of manganese and aluminum.  It is among the worst commercial food you could give your baby. It is likely that at some point in the future when all the health complications are fully appreciated, it will be removed from the market and banned. However, even milk-based infant formulas have been found to be contaminated with chemical additives (including some that are organic!). The next best alternative to breast milk is to make a healthy homemade infant formula. There may be others, but here is one recipe for homemade formula created by the Weston Price Foundation, which I believe is sound.

Seven Reasons to Breastfeed Your Child That You Need to Know 5 ...,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2004/05/19/breast-feeding-part-one.aspx,
Breastfeeding Promotes Your Baby's Gut and Brain Development,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/08/26/probably-best-way-to-enhance-your-babys-gut-and-brain-development.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  A vast amount of research has reported that breast-feeding plays an important role for the development of a newborn. Non-breast fed premature infants have higher risk of developing infantile diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis. In a recent study, the content of brain cell growth factors and cytokines in human breast milk was analyzed. Growth factors and cytokines were found in all breast milk samples at varying concentrations. According to the study, as linked by Green Med Info:  ""It could be demonstrated that protein extracts of breast milk increased the amount of surviving enteric neurones as well as neurite outgrowth. Additionally it was shown, that the number of nestin and S100-expressing glial cells increased significantly after incubating in breast milk protein extracts. The data suggest that milk-born proteins support the development of the enteric nervous system.""  For more information about the benefits of breast milk and breastfeeding, you can click on the Green Med Info links below. Breastfeeding offers a list of life-long health benefits for both mom and baby, making it the best food you can give to your baby by far. Many are aware that breast milk contains antibodies, or immune molecules, that are transferred to the baby, giving her immunities to illnesses that the mother is immune to. The converse is also true -- if your newborn is exposed to a germ, she will transfer it back to the mother while nursing. The mother's body will then make antibodies to that particular germ and transfer them back to the baby at the next feeding. So it's not just a matter of vitamins, minerals, proteins and fats that makes breast milk far superior to formula. In fact, as a new study revealed, breast milk also contains substances that may significantly enhance your baby's gut and brain development.  How Breast Milk Supports Baby's Gut and Brain  Researchers recently analyzed human breast milk for brain cell growth factors (neurotrophic factors) and cytokines. Neurotrophic factors are proteins involved in the growth and survival of developing neurons -- they are essential during the early development of your brain and also help maintain healthy neuronal function throughout your life. ""Trophic"" is actually derived from a Greek word meaning ""to nourish,"" so neurotrophic factors are substances that nourish your neurons, or nerve, cells.  As for cytokines, they are substances secreted by immune system cells that play a role in cellular communication and behavior. Not only were growth factors and cytokines found in all breast milk samples at varying concentrations, but researchers demonstrated that protein extracts of breast milk increased the amount of surviving enteric neurons as well as neurite outgrowth, which indicates it likely plays a beneficial role in enteric nervous system development.  Why it's Important to Nourish Your Baby's Enteric Nervous System  Your brain and gut are actually created out of the same type of tissue. During fetal development, one part turns into your central nervous system while the other develops into your enteric nervous system. These two systems are connected via the vagus nerve; the tenth cranial nerve that runs from your brain stem down to your abdomen.  This is what connects your two ""brains"" together. Your gut is quite literally your second brain, and they work in tandem, each influencing the other. This is why your intestinal health can have such a profound influence on your mental health, and vice versa. An important example of this is explained in my interview below with Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride, a Russian neurologist who demonstrates that an impairment in a woman's gut flora due to antibiotic and birth control exposure, along with a poor diet, is then transferred to the children she has. This impairment in gut flora then makes her children sitting ducks for autism and other brain injuries.   Total Video Length: 1:13:21 Dr. Campbell-McBride has developed an extensive recovery protocol that has helped many thousands of autistic children recover. It involves no drugs, but rather dietary changes and detoxification intended to heal and rebalance the child's gut flora.  Breastfeeding can help your child's gut flora to develop in a beneficial way right from the start, as it provides protective, nourishing factors for both the brain and the gut. Dr. Campbell-McBride is convinced that autistic children are in fact born with perfectly normal brains and perfectly normal sensory organs. She explains:  ""What happens in these children [is that] they do not develop normal gut flora from birth  Gut flora is a hugely important part of our human physiology. Recently research in Scandinavia has demonstrated that 90 percent of all cells and all genetic material in a human body is our own gut flora. We are just a shell a habitat for this mass of microbes inside us. We ignore them at our own peril. As a result, their digestive systeminstead of being a source of nourishment for these childrenbecomes a major source of toxicity. These pathogenic microbes inside their digestive tract damage the integrity of the gut wall. So all sort of toxins and microbes flood into the bloodstream of the child, and get into the brain of the child. That usually happens in the second year of life in children who were breast fed because breastfeeding provides a protection against this abnormal gut flora. In children who were not breastfed, I see the symptoms of autism developing in the first year of life. So breastfeeding is crucial to protect these children.""   Breast milk is loaded with nutrient growth factors that will support the growth of beneficial bacteria. It also has components that will inhibit the growth of bad bacteria and yeast. So one of the most important foundational elements of building a healthy GI system for your child is to first eat a healthy, probiotic-rich diet while you're pregnant, and then breastfeed after your child is born.  The Many Benefits of Breastfeeding   Studies have shown that breastfed babies gain added protection against:    Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) Eczema Respiratory- and other types of infections   Heart disease Obesity Type 1 and type 2 diabetes   Bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease Asthma and allergies Necrotizing enterocolitis among premature babies     Breastfeeding can also help promote cognitive development in your child. It also benefits the mother in several ways, including:    Enhancing maternal behavior through increased oxytocin release ""Natural birth control,"" as it suppresses ovulation, making pregnancy less likely Diabetic mothers typically require less insulin   Easier weight loss Reducing your risk of endometrial-, ovarian- and breast cancers Reducing your risk of metabolic syndrome     As you can see, breastfeeding is actually about so much more than just feeding. It may even have a direct impact on a mother's brain, promoting 'maternal behavior' and increasing emotional bonding between the mother and child. This is not altogether surprising, since breastfeeding promotes the increased release of oxytocin, also known as the ""love hormone"" or ""bonding hormone.""  Do You Need Help Breastfeeding?  The majority of women are able to produce adequate supplies of milk and breastfeed successfully. Often, those who believe they cannot may be misinformed, and believe they don't have enough milk; this is a common misperception. In the vast majority of circumstances, most women have enough milk to breastfeed. The more your baby nurses, the more milk you will produce! This is why supplementing with formula can be detrimental to your milk supply.  Mom needs to drink plenty of water and seek optimal nutrition while nursing -- and the beginning weeks and months are critical in the process. You should begin nursing as soon after birth as possible, as your baby's sucking instinct will be very strong at that time, giving you the best chance of success.

But even many hospitals offer breastfeeding classes and lactation consultants who can help you. I do encourage you to do all you can to breastfeed your baby successfully, and exclusively, for at least the first six months, ideally longer. This is one of the best gifts you can give to your child and the health benefits will last a lifetime.

Breastfeeding vs Formula Feeding -- What's the Real Deal?,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/11/13/breastfeeding-vs-formula-feeding.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  The  market for functional and fortified foods grew significantly from 2012 to 2013,  with infant formula topping the list. In  2013, infant formula added nearly $5 billion in global sales, dwarfing gains  seen for energy drinks ($3.5 billion), pre- and probiotic yogurts ($2.4  billion) and waters ($2 billion).1  Middle-Class Consumers Are Being Targeted by Infant Formula Marketers  The  infant formula market isnt done growing yet. Experts believe that the product  will maintain an 11 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) until 2018, with  middle-class markets (especially those in Asia) largely fueling the rapid  expansion. Analyst Diana Cowland told FoodNavigator-USA:2  It is the rapidly  expanding base of middle-class consumers in emerging economies, with high  aspirations for their children and a willingness to make sacrifices, which is  the prime target audience for products containing ingredients which benefit  developing brains.  In  order to make up for the European and American infant-formula markets, which  are described as more sluggish, the marketers are now targeting Asia and  potentially Africa and the Middle East with earnest.  Whats the Real Cost of  Formula Feeding Your Baby?  Depending  on which type of formula you choose, it can cost upwards of $1,500 to $3,000 a  year to purchase enough formula to feed an infant. But thats only the  beginning. Breastfeeding offers a  long list of life-long health benefits, not just for the child, but for the  mother as well. Studies have shown that breastfed babies gain added protection  against:    Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)  Eczema Respiratory and other types of infections   Heart disease Obesity Type 1 and type 2 diabetes   Bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease Asthma and allergies Necrotizing enterocolitis among premature babies    Breastfeeding  can also help promote cognitive development in your child. It also benefits the  mother in several ways, including:    Enhancing maternal behavior through increased oxytocin release ""Natural birth control,"" as it suppresses ovulation, making pregnancy less likely Diabetic mothers typically require less insulin   Easier weight loss Reducing your risk of endometrial, ovarian and breast cancers Reducing your risk of metabolic syndrome     Not Breastfeeding Costs Billions of Dollars a Year, May Contribute  to Tens of Thousands of Illnesses  However,  you dont have to fall prey to the marketing plans of these companies, as there  are far better foods for your baby. By not breastfeeding, you and your  baby miss out on these important benefits noted above, which translates into  increased risk of diseases and corresponding medical costs. One study estimated the increased  medical costs of diseases caused by a lack of breastfeeding infants in their  first six months of life to be $13 billion each year in the US alone. The  researchers concluded:3  If 90% of US families could comply with medical  recommendations to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months, the United States would  save $13 billion per year and prevent an excess 911 deaths, nearly all of which  would be in infants ($10.5 billion and 741 deaths at 80% compliance). Women,  too, miss out when they formula feed in lieu of breastfeeding. Separate  research found that current US breastfeeding rates, in which only 23 percent of  women breastfeed for at least one year after birth, translate to:4  4,981 excess cases of breast cancer 53,847 cases of hypertension 13,946 cases of myocardial  infarction   This was compared with a cohort of 1.88 million US women who  optimally breastfed, and assumes that observed associations between  breastfeeding duration and maternal health are causal. The study concluded:  suboptimal breastfeeding incurs a total of $17.4 billion in cost to society  resulting from premature death,  $733.7 million in direct costs, and $126.1 million indirect morbidity costs   Even When You Factor in More Maternity Leave for Women,  Breastfeeding Still Saves Money  Increasing  numbers of women are co- or primary breadwinners in their households and may  return to work just weeks after giving birth. This, coupled with the fact that  research shows breastfeeding duration tends to be longer when maternity leave  is lengthened,5 represents one barrier to women wishing to breastfeed for longer periods. The  above referenced study that found not breastfeeding costs the US economy at  least $13 billion a year was sharply criticized for this very reason, with  critics saying it did not take into account the monetary losses women in the  workforce would incur by taking the time to breastfeed. So, the researchers  conducted another study that factored in such additional costs, including pediatric health costs, formula costs,  cost of extra food for breastfeeding women, paid leave, and additional factors.  The results spoke for themselves:6  If  90% of mothers could comply with current medical recommendations around  breastfeeding, our economy could save $3.7 billion in direct and indirect  pediatric health costs, with $10.1 billion in premature death from pediatric  disease. We would spend $3.9 billion less per year on infant formula.  Additional food for nursing mothers would cost up to $1.6-2.1 billion, and more  Baby-Friendly births [designed to promote breastfeeding] would cost $0.145  billion. Paid leave would cost $6.2 billion for 12 weeks at 55%  pay Even including paid leave, the net cost to our economy of our suboptimal  breastfeeding rates would still be at least $8.7 billion. Paid leave would be  expected to improve breastfeeding duration and reduce disparities.  As a revealing aside, the study also  uncovered that the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,  and Children (WIC) budget is dependent on  rebates from formula companies, which obviously represents a major conflict  with promoting the healthier option of breastfeeding:  Note that current formula company rebates of $2 billion  to Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children  (WIC) are equal to 32% of net WIC expenditures The WIC budget is dependent on  formula company rebates, a conflicting situation.   This Is About Empowerment, Not an Attack on Formula-Feeding Moms  As  the benefits of breastfeeding are beginning to be more widely recognized, at  least in the US, there has been a growing stigma against moms who formula-feed  their babies. If youre a formula-feeding mom, please dont feel attacked or  judged! The  information Ive compiled here is meant to empower women with the information they need to make healthy choices. Many women do  not have access to the truth about breastfeeding and have been mislead by  infant-formula marketing to believe they must spend thousands of dollars a year  to provide the best nutrition for their babies. In reality (and barring any  extreme exceptions such as certain transmittable diseases or drug use), breast  milk is the best food for babies, period. Ideally, you'll want to strive to breastfeed your baby  exclusively for the first 6 months, at which point you can begin to supplement  with solid foods and continue to breastfeed for a year or longer. But remember,  even breastfeeding for as little as one month can impart great health benefits  for both you and your baby.  Most Women Can Successfully  Breastfeed Their Babies  There are  certain medical conditions that can prevent a woman from breastfeeding, however  the majority of women are able to produce adequate supplies of milk and  breastfeed successfully. Often, those who believe they cannot may be  misinformed, and believe they don't have enough milk; this is a common  misperception.

The Amazing Benefits of Breastfeeding,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/01/02/amazing-benefits-breastfeeding.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Contrary to what infant formula companies want you to believe, infant formula cannot replace breast milk when it comes to protecting your baby's health and promoting healthy long-term development.   In fact, breastfeeding offers a long list of life-long health benefits not just for the baby but for mother as well.   Considering the fact that babies have been successfully raised on breast milk since the beginning of mankind, it stands to reason that breast milk is a perfect food in every way, providing a growing infant with everything it needs.  Modern science confirms this logic, and it is my hope that more women start reevaluating their choice to substitute breastfeeding with infant formulas.   Nursing even has health benefits beyond nutrition. As noted in the video above, breastfeeding helps expand your child's palate and allows his oral cavity to develop properly, which helps prevent breathing disorders such as snoring and sleep apnea, and all the health risks associated with such sleep disruptions.  Breast Milk Is a Complete Food    As noted in the featured article in The Stranger:1   ""Colostrum, the thick golden liquid that first comes out of a woman's breasts after giving birth ... is engineered to be low in fat but high in carbohydrates and protein, making it quickly and easily digestible ...  Mature breast milk, which typically comes in a few days after a woman has given birth, is 3 to 5 percent fat and holds an impressive list of minerals and vitamins: sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, phosphorous, and vitamins A, C, and E.   Long chain fatty acids like DHA (an omega-3) and AA (an omega-6)  both critical to brain and nervous-system development  also abound in mother's milk.   The principal carbohydrate in breast milk is lactose, which provides copious calories and energy to fuel babies' relentless round-the-clock growth ...   Other sugars are also present, including some 150 oligosaccharides ... complex chains of sugars unique to human milk ... These oligosaccharides can't be digested by infants; they exist to feed the microbes that populate a baby's digestive system.  And speaking of microbes, there's a ton of them in breast milk ... much like yogurt and naturally fermented pickles and kefir, that keep our digestive systems functioning properly.""   Besides healthy bacteria, breast milk is also loaded with nutrient growth factors that support the growth of beneficial bacteria, along with components that inhibit the growth of bad bacteria and yeast.   So breast milk really ""primes"" your baby's gut and promotes the colonization of a healthy microbiome. This, we now know, is critical for both short- and long-term health.   Another important nutrient in breast milk that is not found in infant formula is cholesterol, which provides other crucial components for the formation of healthy nerve tissues.   Breast Milk Offers Natural Immunity    As noted in the featured article,2 ""Not nearly enough people know about this mind-blowing characteristic of breast milk: It changes daily based on signals from the baby."" Indeed, it's not just vitamins, minerals, proteins, and fats that make breast milk far superior to formula.   For starters, breast milk also contains antibodies, or immune molecules, that provide the baby with natural immunity to illnesses that the mother is immune to. This is why breastfed babies tend to have far fewer colds than formula fed babies.  Breastfed babies also have fewer ear, respiratory, stomach, and intestinal infections than their formula-fed counterparts. Perhaps even more remarkable, when a newborn is exposed to a germ, he or she will transfer it back to the mother while nursing.   The mother will then make antibodies to that particular germ and transfer them back to the baby at the next feeding, thereby speeding up the recovery process and promoting future immunity toward the organism, should it be encountered again.  Breast milk also contains growth factors that significantly enhance your baby's gut and brain development, and even helps augment emotional perception and social development.3  It may also help prevent obesity later in life, and offers protection against diseases such as type 2 diabetes.   Variations in Breast Milk Linked to Differences in Infant Obesity   Previous research has shown that children of obese mothers have an increased risk of future obesity, but recent research4,5 suggests the composition of a mother's breast milk may be a far more significant factor, and it goes back to the oligosaccharides mentioned earlier.   Twenty-five pairs of mothers and infants were included in the study, which found that infant growth and obesity was linked to variations in the complex carbohydrates (milk oligosaccharides) in the mothers' milk.   At 6 months of age, children whose mother's milk contained higher levels of two particular oligosaccharides gained about 1 pound more body fat than those with lower levels. Other oligosaccharides were found to be protective against obesity at 6 months, with one particular oligosaccharide being associated with a 1-pound lower fat mass.   According to the authors of this study, individual breast milk composition was more predictive of infant obesity than maternal obesity and pregnancy weight gain. Oligosaccharides are complex carbohydrates unique to breast milk. Their primary function, besides providing energy for rapid growth, is to feed the microbes in your baby's digestive tract, and numerous studies have demonstrated that the makeup of your gut microbiome can have a significant bearing on your weight.  Please note that milk oligosaccharides are not found in infant formula. They're unique to breast milk. Sugars in breast milk and infant formula are NOT the same. Infant formulas typically have processed corn syrup and refined sugar as their largest ingredient, both of which are high in fructose. In fact, many infant formulas have as much sugar as a can of soda. Fructose has NONE of the benefits of lactose and comes with a long list of adverse metabolic effects.6   There is a good deal of evidence that the addition of fructose to virtually every processed food on grocery store shelves today, including infant formula, is largely responsible for the explosion of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Research published in the journal Diabetes Cares hows that formula-fed babies are more likely to develop type 2 diabetes as adolescents.7  Breast Milk Helps Protect Preemies Against Blindness   Breast milk may be particularly important for preemies. Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is an eye disease that in 10 percent of severe cases causes blindness. More than half of preemies born before 30 weeks of gestation are afflicted, and up to 50,000 children around the globe go blind as a result of it each year. A recent analysis suggests this number could be reduced by more than 50 percent if all preemies were fed breast milk.   The analysis looked at five studies published between 2001 and 2013, and found that prematurely born babies who received their mother's milk had a 46 to 90 percent reduced risk of developing ROP. The wide gap was due to variations in the amount of milk they received, and how severe their condition was. As reported by NPR:8   ""Infants who exclusively received breast milk had 89 percent reduced odds of severe ROP compared to infants who received any formula. Infants who received a mixture of breast milk and formula had roughly half the odds of developing severe ROP compared to infants exclusively receiving formula.  The analysis included a very large older study that had found no reduced risk for ROP from breast milk, but most infants in that study received less than 20 percent breast milk.""   Breast milk has also been shown to reduce other complications associated with premature birth, including:  Necrotizing enterocolitis, a severe gastrointestinal disease Blood infections Lung disease    How Breastfeeding Benefits the Mother   In the short-term, nursing helps a woman shed that extra ""baby weight"" she put on during pregnancy. That alone is reason enough to breastfeed for many women, but the benefits go far beyond that. For example, recent research9 suggests breastfeeding may reduce a woman's risk of cardiovascular disease later in life. Starting in 1985, the cardiovascular risk factors in 846 women were recorded. Twenty years later, the women underwent ultrasound to measure the thickness of their carotid arteries. Thicker arteries are a risk factor for heart disease. As reported in The New York Times:10   ""After controlling for many other risk factors, including race, blood pressure, B.M.I., age, and cholesterol levels, they found that the less time a woman breastfed, the thicker her carotid arteries. In addition, almost 17 percent of women who lactated for a month or less had atherosclerotic plaques, compared with less than 11 percent of those who breastfed for 10 months or longer.   Pregnancy makes the cardiovascular system work harder, increasing the risk for cardiovascular disease, and the authors suggest that lactation helps restore maternal physiological systems to their pre-pregnancy state.""   Other studies11 have also shown breastfeeding benefits the mother by:      Enhancing maternal behavior through increased release of oxytocin, a hormone referred to as the ""love hormone,"" or ""bonding hormone""   Acting as a natural birth control, as it suppresses ovulation, making pregnancy less likelyReducing diabetic mothers' need for insulin, as lactation lowers glucose levels naturally     Reducing the risk of women with gestational diabetes from becoming lifelong diabetics.   In one recent study,12 a woman's risk of progressing from gestational diabetes to type 2 diabetes was inversely associated with length and intensity of breastfeeding   Reducing your risk of endometrial, ovarian, and breast cancers, including hormone receptor negative tumors,13 which are a very aggressive form of breast cancerReducing your risk of metabolic syndrome    New Moms Need More Support   Hospitals also need to do a better job when it comes to promoting breastfeeding, and supporting women who want, but may struggle, to nurse. While some women cannot, for a variety of reasons, breastfeed, most can. More often than not, they simply need a little bit of guidance and support. As noted in a recent CNN article,14 only 14 percent of babies born in the U.S. are born in hospitals offering breast-feeding support according to the global standard, which includes, but is not limited to, teaching nursing techniques and feeding cues, and allowing the father and baby to stay in the same room as the mother to facilitate round-the-clock nursing.   Perhaps even more egregious, most hospitals insist on giving infant formula to breastfed babies, sometimes against the mother's wishes, which can make breastfeeding more difficult. As a society (and employers especially), we really need to provide new moms with the support and the means to breastfeed. In some cases, it's a matter of knowing your rights. According to the Affordable Care Act, nursing mothers who work have the right to:  Reasonable break times to express breast milk during your work day, for up to one year after the birth of your child A private place to pump other than a bathroom   Do You Need Help Breastfeeding?     The majority of women are able to produce adequate supplies of milk and breastfeed successfully. One common misperception is that you're not producing enough milk. It's important to realize that the more your baby nurses, the more milk you will produce. This is why supplementing with formula can be detrimental to your milk supply. Nursing moms also need to drink plenty of water and seek optimal nutrition while nursing. The first few weeks and months are critical in the process.   You should begin nursing as soon after birth as possible, as your baby's sucking instinct will be very strong at that time, giving you the best chance of success. In the beginning, the milk that is produced is called colostrum  a thick, golden-yellow fluid that is very gentle for your baby's stomach and full of beneficial antibodies. As your baby continues to nurse, your milk will gradually change in color and consistency from thick and yellow, to thinner with a bluish-white hue.   Newborns need to nurse at least once every two hours, for about 15 minutes or so on each side, but most do not adhere to any kind of strict schedule and feedings can vary in length. It is this frequent nursing that stimulates your breasts to produce increasing amounts of milk to keep up with demand.   You may want to begin planning for successful breastfeeding before your baby is even born by taking a breastfeeding class while you're pregnant. La Leche League15 is a terrific resource to contact for help whether you want to prepare beforehand or find you're having trouble breastfeeding once your baby is born. Also find out whether your hospital of choice offers breastfeeding classes and lactation consultants who can help you. If it doesn't, you may want to select a hospital that offers greater support.  Healthier Alternatives to Infant Formula   I encourage you to do all you can to breastfeed your baby successfully, and exclusively, for at least the first six months; and longer if possible. This is one of the best gifts you can give to your child and the health benefits will last a lifetime. If you find yourself unable to breastfeed, or you have adopted your newborn, you may want to consider using donated breast milk. Unfortunately, there is a major downside to using breast milk from human milk banks that are now available in the U.S. The milk has been pasteurized, which means many of the essential immune-building elements will be decimated in the pasteurization process and your infant will fail to receive this crucial support when they need it the most.  So while human milk banks are a fantastic idea, the sad reality is that milk obtained from them  assuming it is pasteurized, as is standard process at most milk banks  is far inferior to breast milk that is unpasteurized. An alternative may be to work with a physician or pediatrician who is willing to help you find a safe milk donor, and who will be involved in a screening process to ensure the milk is safe. If you're unable to breastfeed or find a safe source of breast milk, your next best bet is to make your own infant formula. There may be others, but here is one recipe for homemade formula created by the Weston Price Foundation, which I believe is sound.  Please steer clear of commercial infant formulas as much as possible. They're far too high in refined sugar for optimal health, and sets your child on the path of craving sugar. Definitely avoid soy infant formula, as it is loaded with dangerously high levels of toxic elements like manganese and aluminum. Soy formula is among the absolute worst commercial foods you could give your baby. However, even milk-based infant formulas have been found to be contaminated with chemical additives (including some boasting the ""organic"" label), and is best avoided.

Benefits of Breastfeeding Your Child,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/04/02/breastfeeding-benefits.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Breastfeeding rates continue to rise in the US. In 2011, the most recent year for which data is available, 79 percent of newborn infants started breastfeeding.1 This is wonderful news, as breastfeeding offers life-long health benefits, not just for the child, but for the mother as well.  Many women do not have access to the truth about breastfeeding and have been misled by infant-formula marketing to believe they must spend thousands of dollars a year to provide the best nutrition for their babies. In reality (and barring any extreme exceptions such as certain transmittable diseases or drug use), breast milk is the best food for babies, period. As reported by the World Health Organization (WHO), breastfeeding is the normal way of providing infants with the nutrients they need to grow and develop. They continue:   Virtually all mothers can breastfeed, provided they have accurate information, and the support of their family, the health care system and society at large. Colostrum, the yellowish, sticky breast milk produced at the end of pregnancy, is recommended by WHO as the perfect food for the newborn, and feeding should be initiated within the first hour after birth.  Exclusive breastfeeding is recommended up to 6 months of age, with continued breastfeeding along with appropriate complementary foods up to two years of age or beyond.    Breastfed Babies Grow into More Successful Adults  Proper nutrition in infancy has lasting effects on health and well-being. A study of nearly 6,000 babies followed from birth until they turned 30 years old found that those who were breastfed had increased intelligence, longer schooling, and higher earning as adults.2 Specifically, when compared to children who breastfed for less than a month, children who were breastfed for at least 12 months grew into adults who:  Scored close to four points higher on IQ tests Attended school for a year longer Made 15 percent more money at the age of 30  The studys lead author, Dr. Bernardo Lessa Horta from the Federal University of Pelotas in Brazil, noted:3   ""Our study provides the first evidence that prolonged breastfeeding not only increases intelligence until at least the age of 30 years but also has an impact both at an individual and societal level by improving educational attainment and earning ability.   What is unique about this study is the fact that, in the population we studied, breastfeeding was not more common among highly educated, high-income women, but was evenly distributed by social class.   Previous studies from developed countries have been criticized for failing to disentangle the effect of breastfeeding from that of socioeconomic advantage, but our work addresses this issue for the first time.""   In the study, the longer the children were breastfed, the better they tended to be doing as adults. Horta mentioned that babies breastfed for six months appeared to get most of the benefits of those who had been breastfed longer, but suggested Mothers should breastfeed for as long as possible.4 In the US, while breastfeeding rates start out strong, many women do not continue as long as recommended. In 2011, only 49 percent of infants were still breastfeeding at six months, and this dropped to 27 percent at 12 months.5 For comparison, in Sweden more than 98 percent of women initiate breastfeeding at birth, and 72 percent are still breastfeeding at six months.6   Breastfeeding Could Save 800,000 Childrens Lives Each Year  Worldwide, less than 40 percent of infants under six months of age are exclusively breastfed. According to WHO, If every child was breastfed within an hour of birth, given only breast milk for their first six months of life, and continued breastfeeding up to the age of two years, about 800 000 child lives would be saved every year. They note multiple reasons why breastfeeding is one of the most effective ways to boost and support your childs health, including:7  Breast milk contains antibodies to protect your baby from childhood illnesses, including diarrhea and pneumonia Promotes sensory and cognitive development Lowers the risk of overweight and obesity into adolescence and adulthood Lowers the risk of type 2 diabetes Improves performance on intelligence tests  Breastfeeding offers benefits to mom, too, including a natural method of birth control (about 98 percent effective for the first six months). Women who breastfeed also have a lower risk of breast and ovarian cancer, lower rates of obesity and return to their pre-pregnancy weight faster.  By not breastfeeding, you and your baby miss out on these important benefits, which translates into increased risk of diseases and corresponding medical costs. One study estimated the increased medical costs of diseases caused by a lack of breastfeeding infants in their first six months of life to be $13 billion each year in the US alone. The researchers concluded:8   If 90% of US families could comply with medical recommendations to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months, the United States would save $13 billion per year and prevent an excess 911 deaths, nearly all of which would be in infants ($10.5 billion and 741 deaths at 80% compliance).   Studies have also shown that breastfed babies gain added protection against:     Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) EczemaRespiratory, ear, and other types of infections  Heart diseaseObesityType 1 and type 2 diabetes  Bowel diseases such as Crohn's diseaseAsthma and allergiesNecrotizing enterocolitis among premature babies     Breastfeeding Encourages Optimal Gut Health in Your Baby  Breastfeeding helps ensure that your child's gut flora develops properly right from the start, as breast milk is loaded both with beneficial bacteria and nutrient growth factors that will support their continued growth. It also has powerful components that will inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and yeast.  Emerging research shows that bacteria are absolutely vital for human health, and imbalances in the human microbiome significantly contribute to chronic non-transmissible diseases. This is no small concern. Many diseases are directly impacted by your microbiome, which is why it's so important to address your baby's gut health both during pregnancy and from birth.  Researchers are also starting to understand how a child's microbiome can play a role in autism. As noted by Scientific American:9   ""Scientists have long wondered whether the composition of bacteria in the intestines, known as the gut microbiome, might be abnormal in people with autism and drive some of these symptoms. Now a spate of new studies10 supports this notion and suggests that restoring proper microbial balance could alleviate some of the disorder's behavioral symptoms.""   Indeed, this is precisely what Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride surmised when she created the Gut and Psychology Syndrome (GAPS) Nutritional Program, which is designed to heal leaky gut by restoring the integrity of your gut lining. According to Dr. Campbell-McBride, in children with GAPS, toxicity flows from their gut throughout their bodies and into their brains. This continually challenges their nervous system, preventing it from performing its normal functions and process sensory information. One of the most important foundational elements of building a healthy gastrointestinal system for your child is to first eat a healthy, probiotic-rich diet while you're pregnant, and then breastfeed after your child is born.   Do You Need Help Breastfeeding?   As the benefits of breastfeeding are beginning to be more widely recognized, at least in the US, there has been a growing stigma against moms who formula-feed their babies. If youre a formula-feeding mom, please dont feel attacked or judged! The information Ive compiled here is meant to empower women with the information they need to make healthy choices. There are certain medical conditions that can prevent a woman from breastfeeding, however the majority of women are able to produce adequate supplies of milk and breastfeed successfully.  Often, those who believe they cannot may be misinformed, and believe they don't have enough milk; this is a common misperception. However, in the vast majority of circumstances, all women have enough milk to breastfeed. The more the baby nurses, the more milk you will produce! Mom needs to drink plenty of water and seek optimal nutrition while nursing. The beginning weeks and months are critical in the process. As the La Leche League states:11   ""Some mothers need to know that they will be able to breastfeed their babies in less than ideal or special circumstances. For example, many mothers have been able to provide their own milk for their premature or ill babies. Many mothers also continue to breastfeed after returning to work and, in most cases, provide sufficient milk.  In other cases, because of lack of knowledge or a poor start, a mother may be in a situation where her body is not producing enough milk. Increasing frequency of nursing, making sure the baby is latched on correctly, and offering both breasts at each feeding are some of the proven techniques that help most nursing mothers increase their supply.""   You should begin nursing as soon after birth as possible, as your baby's sucking instinct will be very strong at that time, giving you the best chance of success. In the beginning, the milk that is produced is called colostrum -- a thick, golden-yellow fluid that is very gentle for your baby's stomach and full of beneficial antibodies. As your baby continues to nurse, your milk will gradually change in color and consistency from thick and yellow, to thinner with a bluish-white hue.

Breastfeeding Promotes Your Baby's Gut and Brain Development,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/08/26/probably-best-way-to-enhance-your-babys-gut-and-brain-development.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  A vast amount of research has reported that breast-feeding plays an important role for the development of a newborn. Non-breast fed premature infants have higher risk of developing infantile diarrhea and necrotizing enterocolitis.

Growth factors and cytokines were found in all breast milk samples at varying concentrations. According to the study, as linked by Green Med Info:  ""It could be demonstrated that protein extracts of breast milk increased the amount of surviving enteric neurones as well as neurite outgrowth. Additionally it was shown, that the number of nestin and S100-expressing glial cells increased significantly after incubating in breast milk protein extracts. The data suggest that milk-born proteins support the development of the enteric nervous system.""  For more information about the benefits of breast milk and breastfeeding, you can click on the Green Med Info links below. Breastfeeding offers a list of life-long health benefits for both mom and baby, making it the best food you can give to your baby by far. Many are aware that breast milk contains antibodies, or immune molecules, that are transferred to the baby, giving her immunities to illnesses that the mother is immune to. The converse is also true -- if your newborn is exposed to a germ, she will transfer it back to the mother while nursing. The mother's body will then make antibodies to that particular germ and transfer them back to the baby at the next feeding. So it's not just a matter of vitamins, minerals, proteins and fats that makes breast milk far superior to formula. In fact, as a new study revealed, breast milk also contains substances that may significantly enhance your baby's gut and brain development.  How Breast Milk Supports Baby's Gut and Brain  Researchers recently analyzed human breast milk for brain cell growth factors (neurotrophic factors) and cytokines. Neurotrophic factors are proteins involved in the growth and survival of developing neurons -- they are essential during the early development of your brain and also help maintain healthy neuronal function throughout your life. ""Trophic"" is actually derived from a Greek word meaning ""to nourish,"" so neurotrophic factors are substances that nourish your neurons, or nerve, cells.  As for cytokines, they are substances secreted by immune system cells that play a role in cellular communication and behavior. Not only were growth factors and cytokines found in all breast milk samples at varying concentrations, but researchers demonstrated that protein extracts of breast milk increased the amount of surviving enteric neurons as well as neurite outgrowth, which indicates it likely plays a beneficial role in enteric nervous system development.  Why it's Important to Nourish Your Baby's Enteric Nervous System  Your brain and gut are actually created out of the same type of tissue. During fetal development, one part turns into your central nervous system while the other develops into your enteric nervous system. These two systems are connected via the vagus nerve; the tenth cranial nerve that runs from your brain stem down to your abdomen.  This is what connects your two ""brains"" together. Your gut is quite literally your second brain, and they work in tandem, each influencing the other. This is why your intestinal health can have such a profound influence on your mental health, and vice versa. An important example of this is explained in my interview below with Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride, a Russian neurologist who demonstrates that an impairment in a woman's gut flora due to antibiotic and birth control exposure, along with a poor diet, is then transferred to the children she has. This impairment in gut flora then makes her children sitting ducks for autism and other brain injuries.   Total Video Length: 1:13:21 Dr. Campbell-McBride has developed an extensive recovery protocol that has helped many thousands of autistic children recover. It involves no drugs, but rather dietary changes and detoxification intended to heal and rebalance the child's gut flora.  Breastfeeding can help your child's gut flora to develop in a beneficial way right from the start, as it provides protective, nourishing factors for both the brain and the gut. Dr. Campbell-McBride is convinced that autistic children are in fact born with perfectly normal brains and perfectly normal sensory organs. She explains:  ""What happens in these children [is that] they do not develop normal gut flora from birth  Gut flora is a hugely important part of our human physiology. Recently research in Scandinavia has demonstrated that 90 percent of all cells and all genetic material in a human body is our own gut flora. We are just a shell a habitat for this mass of microbes inside us. We ignore them at our own peril. As a result, their digestive systeminstead of being a source of nourishment for these childrenbecomes a major source of toxicity. These pathogenic microbes inside their digestive tract damage the integrity of the gut wall. So all sort of toxins and microbes flood into the bloodstream of the child, and get into the brain of the child. That usually happens in the second year of life in children who were breast fed because breastfeeding provides a protection against this abnormal gut flora. In children who were not breastfed, I see the symptoms of autism developing in the first year of life. So breastfeeding is crucial to protect these children.""   Breast milk is loaded with nutrient growth factors that will support the growth of beneficial bacteria. It also has components that will inhibit the growth of bad bacteria and yeast. So one of the most important foundational elements of building a healthy GI system for your child is to first eat a healthy, probiotic-rich diet while you're pregnant, and then breastfeed after your child is born.  The Many Benefits of Breastfeeding   Studies have shown that breastfed babies gain added protection against:    Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) Eczema Respiratory- and other types of infections   Heart disease Obesity Type 1 and type 2 diabetes   Bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease Asthma and allergies Necrotizing enterocolitis among premature babies     Breastfeeding can also help promote cognitive development in your child. It also benefits the mother in several ways, including:    Enhancing maternal behavior through increased oxytocin release ""Natural birth control,"" as it suppresses ovulation, making pregnancy less likely Diabetic mothers typically require less insulin   Easier weight loss Reducing your risk of endometrial-, ovarian- and breast cancers Reducing your risk of metabolic syndrome     As you can see, breastfeeding is actually about so much more than just feeding. It may even have a direct impact on a mother's brain, promoting 'maternal behavior' and increasing emotional bonding between the mother and child. This is not altogether surprising, since breastfeeding promotes the increased release of oxytocin, also known as the ""love hormone"" or ""bonding hormone.""  Do You Need Help Breastfeeding?  The majority of women are able to produce adequate supplies of milk and breastfeed successfully. Often, those who believe they cannot may be misinformed, and believe they don't have enough milk; this is a common misperception. In the vast majority of circumstances, most women have enough milk to breastfeed. The more your baby nurses, the more milk you will produce! This is why supplementing with formula can be detrimental to your milk supply.  Mom needs to drink plenty of water and seek optimal nutrition while nursing -- and the beginning weeks and months are critical in the process. You should begin nursing as soon after birth as possible, as your baby's sucking instinct will be very strong at that time, giving you the best chance of success. In the beginning, the milk that is produced is called colostrum -- a thick, golden-yellow fluid that is very gentle for your baby's stomach and full of beneficial antibodies. As your baby continues to nurse, your milk will gradually change in color and consistency from thick and yellow, to thinner with a bluish-white hue. Newborns need to nurse at least once every two hours, for about 15 minutes or so on each side, but most do not adhere to any kind of strict schedule and feedings can vary in length. It is this frequent nursing that stimulates your breasts to produce increasing amounts of milk to keep up with demand. You may want to begin planning for successful breastfeeding before your baby is even born by taking a breastfeeding class while you're pregnant. Le Leche League is a terrific resource to contact for help whether you want to prepare beforehand or find you're having trouble breastfeeding once your baby is born. But even many hospitals offer breastfeeding classes and lactation consultants who can help you. I do encourage you to do all you can to breastfeed your baby successfully, and exclusively, for at least the first six months, ideally longer. This is one of the best gifts you can give to your child and the health benefits will last a lifetime.

Breastfeeding vs Formula Feeding -- What's the Real Deal?,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/11/13/breastfeeding-vs-formula-feeding.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  The  market for functional and fortified foods grew significantly from 2012 to 2013,  with infant formula topping the list. In  2013, infant formula added nearly $5 billion in global sales, dwarfing gains  seen for energy drinks ($3.5 billion), pre- and probiotic yogurts ($2.4  billion) and waters ($2 billion).1  Middle-Class Consumers Are Being Targeted by Infant Formula Marketers  The  infant formula market isnt done growing yet. Experts believe that the product  will maintain an 11 percent compound annual growth rate (CAGR) until 2018, with  middle-class markets (especially those in Asia) largely fueling the rapid  expansion. Analyst Diana Cowland told FoodNavigator-USA:2  It is the rapidly  expanding base of middle-class consumers in emerging economies, with high  aspirations for their children and a willingness to make sacrifices, which is  the prime target audience for products containing ingredients which benefit  developing brains.  In  order to make up for the European and American infant-formula markets, which  are described as more sluggish, the marketers are now targeting Asia and  potentially Africa and the Middle East with earnest.  Whats the Real Cost of  Formula Feeding Your Baby?  Depending  on which type of formula you choose, it can cost upwards of $1,500 to $3,000 a  year to purchase enough formula to feed an infant. But thats only the  beginning. Breastfeeding offers a  long list of life-long health benefits, not just for the child, but for the  mother as well. Studies have shown that breastfed babies gain added protection  against:    Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)  Eczema Respiratory and other types of infections   Heart disease Obesity Type 1 and type 2 diabetes   Bowel diseases such as Crohn's disease Asthma and allergies Necrotizing enterocolitis among premature babies    Breastfeeding  can also help promote cognitive development in your child. It also benefits the  mother in several ways, including:    Enhancing maternal behavior through increased oxytocin release ""Natural birth control,"" as it suppresses ovulation, making pregnancy less likely Diabetic mothers typically require less insulin   Easier weight loss Reducing your risk of endometrial, ovarian and breast cancers Reducing your risk of metabolic syndrome     Not Breastfeeding Costs Billions of Dollars a Year, May Contribute  to Tens of Thousands of Illnesses  However,  you dont have to fall prey to the marketing plans of these companies, as there  are far better foods for your baby. By not breastfeeding, you and your  baby miss out on these important benefits noted above, which translates into  increased risk of diseases and corresponding medical costs. One study estimated the increased  medical costs of diseases caused by a lack of breastfeeding infants in their  first six months of life to be $13 billion each year in the US alone. The  researchers concluded:3  If 90% of US families could comply with medical  recommendations to breastfeed exclusively for 6 months, the United States would  save $13 billion per year and prevent an excess 911 deaths, nearly all of which  would be in infants ($10.5 billion and 741 deaths at 80% compliance). Women,  too, miss out when they formula feed in lieu of breastfeeding. Separate  research found that current US breastfeeding rates, in which only 23 percent of  women breastfeed for at least one year after birth, translate to:4  4,981 excess cases of breast cancer 53,847 cases of hypertension 13,946 cases of myocardial  infarction   This was compared with a cohort of 1.88 million US women who  optimally breastfed, and assumes that observed associations between  breastfeeding duration and maternal health are causal. The study concluded:  suboptimal breastfeeding incurs a total of $17.4 billion in cost to society  resulting from premature death,  $733.7 million in direct costs, and $126.1 million indirect morbidity costs   Even When You Factor in More Maternity Leave for Women,  Breastfeeding Still Saves Money  Increasing  numbers of women are co- or primary breadwinners in their households and may  return to work just weeks after giving birth. This, coupled with the fact that  research shows breastfeeding duration tends to be longer when maternity leave  is lengthened,5 represents one barrier to women wishing to breastfeed for longer periods. The  above referenced study that found not breastfeeding costs the US economy at  least $13 billion a year was sharply criticized for this very reason, with  critics saying it did not take into account the monetary losses women in the  workforce would incur by taking the time to breastfeed. So, the researchers  conducted another study that factored in such additional costs, including pediatric health costs, formula costs,  cost of extra food for breastfeeding women, paid leave, and additional factors.  The results spoke for themselves:6  If  90% of mothers could comply with current medical recommendations around  breastfeeding, our economy could save $3.7 billion in direct and indirect  pediatric health costs, with $10.1 billion in premature death from pediatric  disease. We would spend $3.9 billion less per year on infant formula.  Additional food for nursing mothers would cost up to $1.6-2.1 billion, and more  Baby-Friendly births [designed to promote breastfeeding] would cost $0.145  billion. Paid leave would cost $6.2 billion for 12 weeks at 55%  pay Even including paid leave, the net cost to our economy of our suboptimal  breastfeeding rates would still be at least $8.7 billion. Paid leave would be  expected to improve breastfeeding duration and reduce disparities.  As a revealing aside, the study also  uncovered that the Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants,  and Children (WIC) budget is dependent on  rebates from formula companies, which obviously represents a major conflict  with promoting the healthier option of breastfeeding:  Note that current formula company rebates of $2 billion  to Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants, and Children  (WIC) are equal to 32% of net WIC expenditures The WIC budget is dependent on  formula company rebates, a conflicting situation.   This Is About Empowerment, Not an Attack on Formula-Feeding Moms  As  the benefits of breastfeeding are beginning to be more widely recognized, at  least in the US, there has been a growing stigma against moms who formula-feed  their babies. If youre a formula-feeding mom, please dont feel attacked or  judged! The  information Ive compiled here is meant to empower women with the information they need to make healthy choices. Many women do  not have access to the truth about breastfeeding and have been mislead by  infant-formula marketing to believe they must spend thousands of dollars a year  to provide the best nutrition for their babies. In reality (and barring any  extreme exceptions such as certain transmittable diseases or drug use), breast  milk is the best food for babies, period. Ideally, you'll want to strive to breastfeed your baby  exclusively for the first 6 months, at which point you can begin to supplement  with solid foods and continue to breastfeed for a year or longer. But remember,  even breastfeeding for as little as one month can impart great health benefits  for both you and your baby.  Most Women Can Successfully  Breastfeed Their Babies  There are  certain medical conditions that can prevent a woman from breastfeeding, however  the majority of women are able to produce adequate supplies of milk and  breastfeed successfully. Often, those who believe they cannot may be  misinformed, and believe they don't have enough milk; this is a common  misperception. However, in the vast majority of circumstances, all women have  enough milk to breastfeed.The more the  baby nurses, the more milk you will produce! Mom needs to drink plenty of water  and seek optimal nutrition while nursing. The beginning weeks and months are  critical in the process. As the La Leche League states:7  ""Some  mothers need to know that they will be able to breastfeed their babies in less than  ideal or special circumstances. For example, many mothers have been  able to provide their own milk for their premature or ill babies. Many mothers  also continue to breastfeed after returning to work and, in most cases, provide  sufficient milk. In  other cases, because of lack of knowledge or a poor start, a mother may be in a  situation where her body is not producing enough milk. Increasing frequency of  nursing, making sure the baby is latched on correctly, and offering both  breasts at each feeding are some of the proven techniques that help most  nursing mothers increase their supply.""   What Are the Next Best  Options to Breastfeeding?  If  you are a woman who is unable to breastfeed, you may want to consider using donated breast milk. Unfortunately, there  is a major downside to using breast milk from human milk banks that are now  available in the US. The milk has been pasteurized, which means many of the  essential immune-building elements will be decimated in the pasteurization  process and your infant will fail to receive this crucial support when they  need it the most. So while human milk banks are a fantastic idea, the sad  reality is that milk obtained from them -- assuming it is pasteurized, as is  standard process at most milk banks -- is far inferior to breast milk that is  unpasteurized. An alternative option to obtain unpasteurized breast milk  straight from a donor may be to work with a physician or pediatrician who will  work with you to find a safe milk donor, and will be involved in a screening  process to ensure the milk is safe. If for  whatever reason you're unable to breastfeed or find a safe source of breast milk, please steer clear of commercial infant  formulas as much as possible and definitely avoid all soy infant  formula,  as it is loaded with toxic elements like high doses of manganese and aluminum. It is  amongthe worst commercial food you could give your baby. It is likely  that at some point in the future when all the health complications are fully  appreciated, it will be removed from the market and banned. However, even  milk-based infant formulas have been found to be contaminated with  chemical additives (including some that are organic!). The next best alternative to breast milk  is to make a healthy homemade infant formula. There may be others, but here is  one recipe for homemade  formula created by the Weston Price Foundation, which I believe is sound.

Brazil Admits Birth Defects Are Not Caused by Zika Virus,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/08/16/birth-defects-brazil-not-zika-virus.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola Amidst growing fear-based propaganda warning of the threat of Zika virus comes a quiet admission from health officials in Brazil: Zika alone may not be responsible for the rise in birth defects that plagued parts of the country. While there is some evidence suggesting Zika virus may be linked to the birth defect microcephaly, and the virus has been spreading throughout Brazil, rates of the condition have only risen to very high rates in the northeast section of Brazil. Since the virus has spread throughout Brazil, but extremely high rates of microcephaly have not, officials are now being forced to admit that something else is likely at play.  Dr. Fatima Marinho, director of information and health analysis at Brazil's ministry of health, told the journal Nature, ""We suspect that something more than Zika virus is causing the high intensity and severity of cases.""1 Nearly 90 Percent of Brazil Microcephaly Cases Occurred in the Northeast Since last November, more than 1,700 confirmed cases of congenital microcephaly or other birth defects of the central nervous system have been reported in Brazil.  When the cases first began and were reportedly linked to Zika virus, health officials believed they'd see ""an explosion of birth defects"" across Brazil, according to Marinho.2 But that hasn't happened.  Data compiled by Marinho and colleagues, which has been submitted for publication, suggest socio-economic factors may be involved. Most of the women who gave birth to babies with microcephaly were poor and lived in small cities or on the outskirts of big cities.   In addition, the outbreak occurred in a largely poverty-stricken agricultural area of Brazil that uses large amounts of banned pesticides.   Between these factors and the lack of sanitation and widespread vitamin A and zinc deficiency, you have the basic framework for an increase in poor health outcomes among newborn infants in that area.   Environmental pollution and toxic pesticide exposure have been positively linked to a wide array of adverse health effects, including birth defects. For instance:    Vitamin A deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of microcephaly3  The CDC lists malnutrition and exposure to toxic chemicals as known risk factors4  The CDC also notes certain infections during pregnancy, including rubella, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis and others, are risk factors  Data Is Lacking to Confirm Zika-Microcephaly Link It's also been suggested that microcephaly may be the result of Zika virus occurring alongside other infections, such as dengue and chikungunya.  The Brazilian doctor who first reportedly established the link between Zika virus and microcephaly is even considering whether another disease, Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), may be involved, as BVDV proteins were also detected in the brains of three fetuses with microcephaly.  BVDV causes birth defects in cattle but is not known to infect people. Researchers suggested that infection with Zika virus may make it easier for BVDV to infect humans.5 Adding to the complexities, much of the microcephaly data from Brazil comes from incomplete hospital reports. In most cases, tests to confirm Zika infection were not carried out.  In June 2016, the Zika in Infants and Pregnancy Study was launched in Puerto Rico. It aims to monitor up to 10,000 pregnant women to examine Zika virus along with nutritional, socio-economic and environmental factors and their potential link to birth defects. However, the results of a similar study have only raised further doubts. 12,000 Zika Cases Confirmed in Pregnant Colombian Women  Zero Microcephaly Cases According to a report by the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI), there are serious questions about whether Zika virus is the cause of microcephaly. They cite the preliminary results of a New England Journal of Medicine study, which followed nearly 12,000 pregnant Colombian women infected with Zika virus.6 No cases of microcephaly were reported in their babies as of May 2016, yet four cases of microcephaly were reported among women who had Zika infection with no symptoms and were therefore not included in the study. The researchers then speculated that this means there could be four times as many cases of Zika infection that are unreported, for a total of at least 60,000 Zika-infected pregnancies in Colombia.  Using this data, an analysis revealed the rate of microcephaly to be what would be expected in any area, whether Zika is in the picture or not, which is 2 cases in 10,000 births.7 According to NECSI:8  ""This gives a consistent interpretation that there is no direct link between Zika and microcephaly except for random co-occurrence.    We note that the base rate of microcephaly in the absence of Zika is 140 per year in Colombia, which is consistent with the approximately 50 microcephaly cases in the first [four] months of 2016, only [four] of which have been connected to Zika. When interpreting Zika as the cause, background cases must be subtracted.""  By June 2016, 11 total microcephaly cases had been reported in women with Zika infections in Colombia. If Zika and microcephaly are linked, NECSI pointed out that the total number of microcephaly cases should rise dramatically in the next few months, reaching more than 10 microcephaly-Zika births each week.9 NECSI also suggested, ""An alternative cause of microcephaly in Brazil could be the pesticide pyriproxyfen, which is cross-reactive with retinoic acid, which causes microcephaly, and is being used in drinking water.""10 WHO Expert: Zika Response 'Completely Hysterical'  Florence Fouque, a World Health Organization (WHO) expert on animals that carry viruses, called the public response to the Zika virus ""completely hysterical.""11 She blamed the hysteria on the findings that the virus affects pregnant women and can be sexually transmitted.   ""It's like AIDS,"" she told PRI. ""People make this link and that's why they are really afraid.""12 At one restaurant in downtown Miami, Florida, where a handful of Zika cases were detected in August 2016, insect repellent was placed on all the tables.13  Even Oliver Brady, an epidemiologist with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who was asked by Brazilian officials to assess the Zika-microcephaly situation, said there's no conclusive evidence that Zika causes birth defects in humans.   He told PRI that while animal studies have shown the virus attacks brain cells, this isn't ""final proof:""14   ""You see that with a lot of arboviruses [viruses spread by mosquitoes and other insects]  They have pathogenic qualities and if you put them in the right tissue then they will cause some sort of damage. And they tend to be quite transmissible across a variety of barriers anyway.     So it doesn't necessarily mean that that's the mechanism that's happening out there in the field, even if it does work in the lab.""  National Institutes of Health Launches Trial for Experimental Zika Vaccine  The U.S. is among those ignoring data and rushing to launch a vaccine against Zika virus before it's even known whether it's causing birth defects. What is known, however, is that experimental vaccines have real risks, which are often downplayed in the wake of perceived global ""emergencies"" such as Zika. In August 2016, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced it launched a clinical trial of an experimental Zika vaccine  again, before there is conclusive proof that Zika causes microcephaly. Eighty healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 35 will be vaccinated with varying doses of the experimental vaccine. No placebos will be given. The vaccine is said to be similar to a West Nile Virus vaccine that was previously developed by the NIH, but has not yet been approved. This alone should be a red flag, as should the disastrous outcome of the CYD-TDV vaccine, the first dengue vaccine approved by WHO in April 2016.  Dengue Vaccine Hints at Potential Problems With Zika Vaccines Dr. Scott B. Halstead, former senior adviser of the Dengue Vaccine Initiative and the founder of Children's Vaccine Initiative, told the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy:15   ""It's happened. We have a vaccine that enhances dengue  It's clear as the nose on my face: Vaccine recipients less than 5 years old had five to seven times more rates of hospitalizations for severe dengue virus than placebo controls.""   He's referring to the results of a three-year study published in the New England Journal of Medicine,16 which suggest the vaccine causes antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Halstead explained:17 ""Over time, you make and keep protective levels of antibody from the initial infection, but you lose the cross-reactive antibodies  That allows a second dengue infection to cause severe illness  ""  At this point, it's unknown how this relates to Zika virus, but it's possible that pre-existing immunity to dengue may lead to more severe infection with Zika virus. The University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy quoted concerns voiced by Dr. Philip K. Russell, the former director of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and commander of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, as well as founding president and chairman of the Sabin Vaccine Institute:   ""Russell said that the fact that Zika is occurring in areas where dengue has been endemic hints at a serious potential problem with ADE and Zika vaccine development. 'The current epidemic of Zika, which is usually mild disease, is made a lot worse in these populations,' Russell said. 'I think there's a major effect, but the studies haven't been done yet to sort that out.'  More Toxic Exposures Are Not the Answer Many areas are ramping up pesticide spraying to combat Zika virus. A Clean Water Act permit is generally required to spray pesticides in areas where they might end up in water. The permit is intended to keep the toxic chemicals from contaminating water, but now the Zika virus has been used as an excuse to do away with this common-sense precaution.  The language was inserted into the Zika Vector Control Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives. It would exempt pesticide applicators from needing a Clean Water Act permit, even when spraying near water. Critics argued the bill would do little to help fight Zika virus, since mosquito-control agencies already have authority to apply pesticides in emergency situations to prevent the spread of infectious disease without applying for permits. Opponents say the bill has nothing to do with combating Zika and, instead, has been on the table for years, with the majority pushing for its passage ""under whatever name"" was convenient at the time.18 A White House spokesman also said it hasn't ruled out relaxing restrictions on some pesticides to fight Zika.19 By removing requirements for permits when spraying pesticides near water, it's likely the use of these chemicals will skyrocket, including via aerial spraying, which was recently started in Miami, Florida. Aerial Mosquito Spraying May Increase Autism Risk Unfortunately, many may suffer as a result. In research presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies 2016 Meeting, aerial pesticide exposure was linked to an increased risk of developmental delays and autism spectrum disorder among children.20 The study compared children living in zip codes where aerial pesticide spraying was used each summer to combat mosquitoes that carry the eastern equine encephalitis virus with children living in non-aerial-spraying zip codes.  Children exposed to the aerial pesticide spraying were about 25 percent more likely to be diagnosed with autism or have a documented developmental delay than those living in areas that used other methods of pesticide application (such as manual spreading of granules).  If authorities use the supposed threat of Zika to increase aerial spraying, it could increase children's risk of brain disorders, which is the opposite of what anti-Zika campaigns are supposed to achieve. Mosquito Experts Admit Zika Threat Risk 'Near Zero' Even mosquito experts are questioning the extent of emergency that actually exists. Chris Barker, Ph.D., a mosquito-borne virus researcher at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, told WebMD:21  ""I think the risk for Zika actually setting up transmission cycles that become established in the continental U.S. is near zero."" Barker expects Zika to go the way of other tropical diseases spread by mosquitoes, such as dengue fever and chikungunya, in the U.S. with small clusters of outbreaks in southern states and little activity elsewhere. You needn't go dousing your backyard in chemicals in an attempt to stay safe from Zika virus (whose connection to birth defects is still being explored).  If, however, mosquitoes are bothersome for you, draining standing water, including pet bowls, gutters, garbage and recycling bins, spare tires, bird baths, children's toys and so on, is important. This is where mosquitoes breed, so if you eliminate standing water you'll eliminate many mosquitoes. A simple house fan could also help keep mosquitoes at bay if you're having a get-together in your backyard or, for a longer-term solution, try installing a bat house (bats are voracious consumers of insects, especially mosquitoes). Regularly consuming garlic may also help protect against mosquito bites, as may the following natural insect repellants:   Cinnamon leaf oil (one study found it was more effective at killing mosquitoes than DEET22)   Clear liquid vanilla extract mixed with olive oil  Wash with citronella soap, and then put some 100 percent pure citronella essential oil on your skin.

The Link Between Birth Control Pills and Depression,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/10/20/birth-control-pills-depression.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola Birth  control pills are the most popular form of contraception among U.S. women. They're  taken by 16 percent of this population, while just over 7 percent use  long-acting reversible forms of contraception, such as a hormonal intrauterine  device or implant. What  these pills, devices and implants have in common is that they're forms of hormonal  birth control  that is, they contain or release synthetic forms of hormones,  such as estrogen and progestin (a form of progesterone), which work to prevent  pregnancy in various ways.  The problem is that  these sex hormones also affect mood and other biological processes and  artificially manipulating them can lead to many unintended consequences in your  body, some of them uncomfortable and some quite serious, including altering  your mental health. Birth Control Pills Linked to Depression Researchers  from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark analyzed data from  more than 1 million women over a period of 14 years. None of the women, who  were between 15 and 34 years of age, had been diagnosed with depression at the start of the study.1 However, the analysis showed that women who used hormonal  birth control had a 40 percent increased risk of developing depression after  six months compared to women who did not. The risk was greatest among  adolescents. The use of hormonal birth control was also associated with  subsequent use of antidepressant drugs. Certain types of hormonal contraception  had varying risks. Specifically, the use of:  Progestin-only pills led to a  1.3-fold higher rate of antidepressant use Combined birth control pills led to  a 1.2 higher rate Transdermal patch led to a 2-fold increased risk Vaginal ring led to a 1.5-fold increased risk  Anecdotal Reports Suggest Hormonal Contraceptives Lead to Mood Changes Lead study supervisor, Dr. jvind Lidegaard, a professor at  the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, told CNN:2 ""We  have known for decades that women's sex hormones estrogen and progesterone have  an influence on many women's mood.  Therefore,  it is not very surprising that also external artificial hormones acting in the  same way and on the same centers as the natural hormones might also influence  women's mood or even be responsible for depression development."" Despite  this knowledge, many health care professionals are reluctant to suggest that  the risks of hormonal birth control may be too steep for some women, especially  those with a history of depression.  While  scientific validation has yielded some conflicting results, one report in the  Oxford Medical Case Reports journal detailed two cases of women with a history  of depression who developed depressive symptoms after treatment  with hormonal contraceptives (the combined oral contraceptive pill,  progestin-only pill and combined contraceptive vaginal ring).3 Case Reports Detail Onset of Depressive Symptoms After Use of Hormonal Contraceptives In  one case, a 31-year-old woman experienced gradual improvement of her depressive  symptoms after she stopped using the vaginal ring. However, ""a  sudden and acute worsening occurred"" shortly after she started using a combined  birth control pill. About a month later, she again experienced a worsening of  symptoms ""almost simultaneously with the initiation of treatment with combined  contraceptive vaginal ring."" The researchers noted:4 ""HC [Hormonal contraception] was  again interrupted, with a subsequent clear improvement in depressive symptoms.  The patient remained stable without depression for the following [six] months."" In  the second case, a 33-year-old woman developed depressive symptoms shortly  after starting a progestin-only birth control pill. Her symptoms disappeared  completely within one week of stopping the pill. The researchers concluded:5 ""Caution should be used when starting  up treatment with HC in women diagnosed with depression, since it might in some  cases lead to worsening of the depressive symptoms.  Likewise,  attention should be paid to the pre-existing use of HC in women who develop  depression, as discontinuation of HC might in some cases be sufficient to treat  the depression."" Hormonal Contraceptives Are Linked to Glaucoma and Other Health Risks Women who  used oral contraceptives for longer than three years were more than twice as  likely to have been diagnosed with glaucoma, a leading cause of vision loss and  blindness, according to one study.6 The results  were so striking that the researchers recommended women taking the pill for  three or more years be screened for glaucoma and followed closely by an  ophthalmologist. It might seem  unusual that contraceptives could affect your vision, but it's important to understand that there are  body-wide repercussions of artificially manipulating your hormones. Most birth  control pills, patches, vaginal rings and implants contain a combination of the  derivatives of the hormones estrogen and progestin. They work by mimicking  these hormones in your body to fool your reproductive system into producing the  following effects:  Preventing your ovaries from  releasing eggs  Thickening your cervical mucus to  help block sperm from fertilizing an egg  Thinning the lining of your uterus,  which makes it difficult for an egg to implant, should it become fertilized   However, your  reproductive system does not exist in a bubble. It is connected to all of your  other bodily systems, and therefore hormonal contraception is capable of  altering much more than your reproductive status.  According to  one report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 30  percent of women who have used the pill and nearly half of women using other  hormonal contraception methods stopped their use due to ""dissatisfaction,""  which was most often caused by side effects.7 Potential health risks include:     Cancer: Women who take birth control pills increase  their risk of cervical and breast cancers, and possibly liver cancer as well.  Thinner bones: Women who take birth control pills have lower  bone mineral density (BMD) than women who have never used oral contraceptives.  Heart disease:Long-term use of birth control pills may increase plaque artery buildups in your body that may raise your risk of heart disease.    Fatal blood clots: Birth control pills increase your risk of blood clots  and subsequent stroke.   Impaired muscle gains: Oral contraceptive use may impair muscle gains from resistance exercise training in women.   Long-term sexual  dysfunction: The pill may interfere with a protein that  keeps testosterone unavailable, leading to long-term sexual dysfunction  including decreased desire and arousal.    Migraines  Weight gain and mood  changes   Yeast overgrowth and  infection    The Pill May Be a Libido Killer About  15 percent of women taking oral contraceptives report a decrease in libido,  likely because they lower levels of sex hormones, including testosterone.8 One  study also found seven  times the amount of the libido-killing sex  hormone binding globulin (SHBG) was present in women who took oral contraceptives  compared to women who never used the pill. Even though  SHBG levels declined in women who had stopped taking the pill, they still  remained three to four times higher than they were in women with no history of  using oral contraceptives, which suggests oral contraceptives may kill a  woman's libido for the long-term. Researchers concluded:9 ""Long-term sexual, metabolic, and  mental health consequences might result as a consequence of chronic SHBG  elevation [in women who take, or have taken, oral contraceptives]."" Synthetic Hormones in Drinking Water May Be Increasing Cancer Rates in Men It's  not only women who are at risk from synthetic hormones contained in hormonal  contraceptives. An analysis of data from 100  countries found oral contraceptive use is associated with prostate cancer,  which may be due to exposure to synthetic estrogens excreted by women that end  up in the drinking water supply.10 While it's been argued that only a  small amount of additional estrogen is excreted by a woman using this form of  contraception, this ""small amount"" is compounded by millions of  women, many of whom use the pill for long periods of time. Also, synthetic  estrogen and progestin does not biodegrade rapidly and is far harder to remove  through conventional water purification systems, resulting in greater  accumulation in the environment. While this study did not prove cause  and effect  that is, it did not prove that environmental estrogen from women's  oral contraceptive use causes prostate cancer in men  it did find a  significant association between the two that deserves further investigation,  especially in light of estrogen's well-established role in a wide range of  cancers and the prevalence of hormonal contraceptive use. Non-Hormonal Methods of Contraception Women  and men looking for reversible non-hormonal options of contraception may be  surprised to learn that there are many options. Conventional health care  providers typically steer patients toward the popular hormonal options, but  they are far from the only ones. Barrier  methods, which work by preventing the man's sperm from reaching the woman's egg,  include the diaphragm, cervical cap, sponge and male and female condoms. None  of these are foolproof, which is why many couples use them in combination with  fertility awareness-based methods. Fertility  awareness involves knowing when a woman's fertile period occurs each month, and  then avoiding sexual intercourse during (and just prior to) this time (or using  a barrier method if you do). When  used consistently and correctly, fertility awareness is highly effective at  preventing pregnancy; fewer than 1 to 5 women out of 100 will become pregnant  using fertility awareness in this manner.11 In order to track  fertility, a number of methods can be used by women, including tracking basal  body temperature, mucus production, saliva indicators and cervical position.  Many  women use a combination of methods, and there are also commercially available  ovulation monitors that can be used in conjunction with the other methods.  Ninety-nine percent of U.S. women of reproductive age have used at least one  contraceptive method at some point in their lifetime, with 88 percent choosing  hormonal options.12 However,  you may be relieved to learn that you don't have to subject yourself to the  risks of hormonal contraception, or learn to live with the side effects, in  order to take control of your reproductive health. An experienced holistic  health care provider can help you choose the best non-hormonal contraception  options for you.

Use of Pesticides Increasingly Threaten Human Health,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/09/08/pesticides-threaten-human-health.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Pesticides... The chemical technology industry insists we can't grow sufficient amounts of food without them, yet mounting research1,2,3 suggests they may carry a great deal of blame for the rise in human disease.  A recent article in The Guardian4 highlights a disturbing trend of spiking rates of birth defects in Kauai, Hawaii, which many suspect is due to an increase in pesticide use on genetically engineered (GE) corn.   Rates of learning disabilities are also higher in areas with heavy pesticide use.   The video above features a clip from a much longer GMO Free News interview with State House Representative Andria Tupola (R) and Tiana Laranio, a Kauai resident.   Birth Defects and Learning Disabilities on the Rise in Kauai   In one school, which is a mere 1700 feet from Syngenta's genetically engineered (GE) corn fields, 10 percent of children need special education, compared to the state average of just over six percent.  As reported in the featured article:   ""In Kauai, chemical companies Dow, BASF, Syngenta, and DuPont spray 17 times more pesticide per acre (mostly herbicides, along with insecticides and fungicides) than on ordinary cornfields in the US mainland, according to the most detailed study5 of the sector...  Sidney Johnson, a pediatric surgeon at the Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children who oversees all children born in Hawaii with major birth defects... says he's been thinking about pesticides a lot lately.   The reason: he's noticed that the number of babies born here with their abdominal organs outside, a rare condition known as gastroschisis, has grown from three a year in the 1980s to about a dozen now...  So he's working with a medical student on a study of his hospital's records to determine whether the parents of the gastroschisis infants were living near fields that were being sprayed around the time of conception and early pregnancy.""     Poisoning Paradise   The reason for this alarmingly elevated use of pesticides on the island of Kauai is because the companies are testing GE corn's ability to resist chemicals that normally kill other plants.   One quarter of the 12,000 acres is dedicated to ""restricted use pesticides""  chemicals known for their elevated toxicity, such as chlorpyrifos, atrazine, and paraquat; the latter two of which are banned in Europe.  In 2012, 18 tons of these ""restricted use"" pesticides were applied in Kauai. Glyphosate, in the form of Roundup, is also used of course, and this broad-spectrum herbicide may also be far more toxic than anyone ever imagined.   Far from being harmless and biodegradable as Monsanto's PR department has maintained, glyphosate has now been reclassified as a ""probable carcinogen"" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a division of the World Health Organization (WHO).  In response to the IARC's determination, some British and German retailers have started removing Roundup from its lineup of weed killers sold to the general public, and France has announced plans to restrict its sale at garden centers.6  In a recent interview, researcher Anthony Samsel, PhD also revealed that internal Monsanto documents show they actually knew, over 30 years ago, that glyphosate caused adenomas and carcinomas in rats...  Recent follow-up research7,8 by Gilles-ric Sralini also shows that long-term exposure to ultra-low amounts of Roundup may cause liver and kidney damage, tumors, and hemorrhagic bleeding.  The expression of more than 4,000 genes in the rats' liver and kidneys had changed in response to the herbicide, and since the dose used is ""environmentally relevant in terms of human, domesticated animals, and wildlife levels of exposure,"" the authors suggest Roundup may have significant health implications.   ""When the spraying is underway and the wind blows downhill from the fields to the town  a time no spraying should occur  residents complain of stinging eyes, headaches, and vomiting,"" The Guardian writes.   Unfortunately, the pesticide companies refuse to divulge exactly which chemicals are used, and in what amounts. This makes treating patients more difficult, as there's no information about what they might have been exposed to.  What's worse, these companies are also operating under a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that was grandfathered in from the days when the area was a sugar plantation. Back then, far fewer pesticides were used, but this decades-old permit still allows them to discharge chemicals into local water supplies.  A number of attempts have been made to restrict the growing of GE crops and curb the undisclosed use of pesticides on the island chain of Hawaii, but none have been completely successful as of yet.   In Maui County, a ballot initiative calling for a moratorium on all GE farming was successfully passed, despite Monsanto and its allies spending $7.2 million to defeat it.   But, the industry sued and a federal judge overturned the law saying the Maui County initiative was preempted by federal law. That and a few other rulings in favor of the chemical technology industry are still under appeal.    Pesticides Pose Greater Risk to Pollinators Than Previously Thought   In related news, a new European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) study has concluded that neonicotinoid pesticides may actually pose a greater risk to bees than previously thought, and is calling for extending the EU's ban on neonicotinoids.   According to The Guardian:9   ""Already proscribed for seed treatments and soil applications, the Efsa analysis says that clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam also pose a 'high risk' to bees when sprayed on leaves.  The UK is currently facing a legal challenge to an emergency exemption it granted, allowing use of two of the substances... But far from supporting the British case, the advisory expert assessment will add to pressure for an extension of the ban to apply to fruit orchards after blooming, and crops grown in greenhouses...""   Syngenta, which manufactures thiamethoxam, has historically not garnered the same horrible reputation as Monsanto. But in this case, Syngenta showed it operates according to the same ruthless rulebook when it threatened to sue EFSA officials involved with the creation of the original risk assessment two years ago.10  Speaking of Syngenta, Monsanto's bid to buy the company has fallen through after Syngenta rejected the latest offer of $47 billion.11 One by one, pesticides are eventually found to be profoundly harmful  at least that appears to be the trend.  So to keep one step ahead, companies need to continue creating new ones, which is likely why Monsanto sought to acquire Syngenta in the first place, In addition to changing their brand name, which has been associated by many with evil incarnate, the purchase would have added mammoth holdings and power to Monsanto's GMO arsenal. With Roundup's patent expiring a few years ago, I believe it's only a matter of time before regulators will have to curb (if not ban) the use of Roundup due to its toxicity, which means Monsanto undoubtedly needs to find something to replace its best-selling flagship product.   Next-Generation Weed and Pest Killers    Disturbingly, Monsanto is reportedly working on a whole new breed of pesticides  sprays that employ RNA interference technology rather than toxic chemicals to kill insects and weeds. In a nutshell, such a product kills its target by way of silencing certain genes that are crucial to the target's survival. As reported by Mother Jones:12   ""RNAi, as it's known, is an emerging science; the two US researchers who discovered it brought home a Nobel Prize in 2006. Regalado describes the process like this:   'The cells of plants and animals carry their instructions in the form of DNA. To make a protein, the sequence of genetic letters in each gene gets copied into matching strands of RNA, which then float out of the nucleus to guide the protein-making machinery of the cell. RNA interference, or gene silencing, is a way to destroy specific RNA messages so that a particular protein is not made.'   If you can nix RNA messages that exist to generate crucial genes, you've got yourself an effective bug or weed killer...  The first obstacle is technological  the problem of 'how to get a large, electrically charged molecule like RNA to move through a plant's waxy cuticle and into its cells,' Regalado writes. That's crucial, because the technology works like this: A targeted bug... chomps on a leaf that's been sprayed by RNA solution and then, fatally, gets critical genes turned off. To make that happen, you have to get the RNA material into the leaf.""   An obvious question here is: how may this RNA material in the plant affect animals and humans that eat it? RNAi sounds reminiscent of the experimental GE wheat created two years ago, which employed a gene silencing technique to alter the wheat's carbohydrate content.   At the time, University of Canterbury Professor Jack Heinemann released results from genetic research he conducted on the wheat, which showed the gene silencing molecules created in the wheat could potentially silence human genes as well. University Professor Judy Carman agreed with Heinemann's analysis, stating that children in whom that specific enzyme does not work tend to die by the age of five.13 So, if you ask me, the health risks may reach brand new heights if this kind of gene silencing technology takes over the pesticide industry.   Pesticide Use Near Schools Raise Concerns   Pesticides pose risks in two ways. One is via contaminated foods  and GE foods in particular, as they're more heavily treated than conventional varieties. The other is via the pesticide application itself. Gardeners, farm workers, and those living near farms are at greatest risk. Concerns over pesticide application near schools, playgrounds, and churches have also been raised.  For example, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) recently released a report14 showing that Roundup is being sprayed in fields next to 12,000 churches, which might put thousands of Christians in harm's way.15   In Ventura County, the Board of Supervisors recently demanded to know why the California Department of Pesticide Regulation allowed strawberry farmers to use ""unusually high"" levels of 1,3-Dichloropropene  a known carcinogen via inhalation or ingestion  on fields surrounding the Rio Mesa high school. A Reveal News article16 discussing this case notes that the California Department of Pesticide Regulation responded to community concerns ""with statements that contradict the findings of their own scientists.""   According to the article:    ""By carving out a loophole for Dow AgroSciences and growers, the department allowed heavy amounts of the pesticide to be used near schools, homes, and businesses in Ventura County, and across the state. In all, the investigation found, more than 100 communities were put at greater risk of cancer... The department was effectively letting growers use as much 1,3-D as they wanted, despite the possible health concerns...""    Conflicts of Interest Place Citizens at Risk   The situation in Ventura County has become typical. Again and again, we see regulators bowing to the will of the chemical industry and growers who aren't wise to less toxic alternatives. The end result is an increasingly toxic food supply, and an increasingly toxic environment. How long are we going to allow the food industry to be one of the greatest sources of pollution and toxic exposure in this world? It's really madness when you stop and think about it.  It really makes one wonder just how bad the situation needs to get before money ceases to have more value than ecological and human life... When it comes to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and pesticides, conflicts of interest seem to have had a particularly strong influence.   In February, the California-based activist group US Right to Know filed a request under Washington's freedom-of-information law (FOIA) to obtain correspondence between 40 researchers at US public universities and 36 different companies, trade groups, and PR firms. The purpose of the FOIA requests was to determine whether or not academics and researchers are coordinating their messaging with the industry, and/or receiving undisclosed remuneration for spreading positive messages about GMO's.   According to the journal Nature,17 obtained documentation included ""roughly 4,600 pages of emails and other records from Kevin Folta, a plant scientist at the University of Florida in Gainesville and a well-known advocate of GM organisms. The records... reveal his close ties to the agriculture giant Monsanto... and other biotechnology-industry interests.""    The Case of Kevin Folta  Kevin Folta is one of the scientists answering questions on the industry website GMO Answers, which is managed by the biotechnology PR firm Ketchum. Folta claimed he never accepted any honoraria for any of his pro-GMO outreach work. According to GMO Watch, a couple of months ago he even declared18 he had ""nothing to do with Monsanto."" Yet the FOIA documentation shows he received an ""unrestricted grant"" of $25,000 from Monsanto in 2014  monies he never disclosed receiving.   According to Gary Ruskin, executive director of US Right to Know:    ""I think it's important for professors who take money from industry to disclose it. And if they're not disclosing it, that's a problem. And if they say they aren't taking money, and they are, then that's a problem.""  To quell growing criticism, Folta's employer now wants the grant money Folta received to be donated to a food pantry.19 A recent article by GMO Watch20 points out how Folta is now playing the victim after playing the public as fools, and is claiming to have received ""implied threats."" But according to GMO Watch, this may be nothing more than ""a flimsy attempt to distract from the real issue  his own apparent dishonesty  while vilifying his critics..."" noting a number of non-GMO advocates and anti-GMO scientists who have received very real death threats.   ""[I]t has to be said that neither Folta playing the victim nor the reallocation of Monsanto's money does anything to address the driving force behind all the criticism,"" GMO Watch writes. ""People are angry with Folta not about the Monsanto money per se, but about Folta not being straight about it or about his wider relationship with the biotech industry. And nothing Folta has done since the news came out has done anything to repair that yawning integrity gap.""   Academics Increasingly Used as Public Relations Pawns   The now-routine ""third-party approach"" of enlisting academics and ""independent"" researchers like Folta to push an industry agenda is also discussed in a recent New York Times article,21 which includes a rather damning quote from Folta to an Monsanto executive. In response to the approval of the $25,000 grant in August last year, Folta wrote back saying: ""I am grateful for this opportunity and promise a solid return on the investment.""  That doesn't sound like a comment from an impartial party, does it? In another email22 from Folta to a Monsanto executive released by US Right to Know, Folta wrote: ""I'm glad to sign on to whatever you like, or write whatever you like.""  Moreover, while the initial Nature23 article made it seem as though Folta had ignored the pre-written answers provided for him by the biotech PR firm Ketchum, along with the questions they sent to be answered for the GMO Answers website, the New York Times claims Folta often did use the canned answers nearly verbatim, noting he now says doing so was ""a mistake,"" and ""absolutely not the right thing."" This is yet another lie Folta's been caught in, according to the latest US Right to Know update on its investigation24  lies that the New York Times did not address.   What's more, since the $25,000 Folta received was given as a SHARE contribution, it's not subject to IDC and not publicly noted. In other words, it's a way for donations to be made without having to disclose the contribution and the potential influence of the donor, while still being able to claim full transparency.    ""Corporations have poured money into universities to fund research for decades, but now, the debate over bioengineered foods has escalated into a billion-dollar food industry war,"" the New York Times writes. ""Companies like Monsanto are squaring off against major organic firms like Stonyfield Farm, the yogurt company, and both sides have aggressively recruited academic researchers, emails obtained through open records laws show.  The emails provide a rare view into the strategy and tactics of a lobbying campaign that has transformed ivory tower elites into powerful players. The use by both sides of third-party scientists, and their supposedly unbiased research, helps explain why the American public is often confused as it processes the conflicting information... There is no evidence that academic work was compromised, but the emails show how academics have shifted from researchers to actors in lobbying and corporate public relations campaigns."" [Emphasis mine]   Another Trend: Retracting Articles Unfavorable to Industry   The FOIA requests issued by US Right to Know also received support in an article25 published in PLOS Biology Community Blog, written by Paul D. Thacker and Charles Seife. Monsanto and the biotech industry at large has developed a pattern of demanding retractions of unfavorable articles, so it was no great surprise to find that Thacker and Seife's article (which argued in favor of using FOIA requests to scrutinize scientists' behavior and potentially undisclosed industry ties) was promptly removed from the PLOS website.   According to PLOS,26,27 the article ""was not consistent with at least the spirit and intent of our community guidelines."" It's become quite clear that not only is the industry trying to monopolize science  allowing only favorable research to see the light of day  they're also trying to protect the system of conflicts of interest. The end goal is to keep consumers in the dark about what's really going on. And about what's in their food. Why else would they pour tens of millions of dollars into lobbying against transparency?    Chemical, Agricultural, and Food Industries All Spend Big Bucks Lobbying for Less Transparency  According to Civil Eats,28 food and beverage companies have spent $51.6 million on a series of efforts to defeat GMO labeling laws, including lobbing for HR 1599, which would bar states from implementing their own GMO labeling laws. As of July 21 Monsanto alone had spent $2.5 million lobbying Congress.29  The food industry has also spent $54.2 million lobbying for the removal of country-of-origin labeling (COOL) requirements for beef, chicken, and pork (HR 2393).30   In a similar vein, in 2013 and 2014, agribusinesses, agricultural organizations, and trade associations spent more than $11 million lobbying for an early version of S1500,31 which eliminates the need for permits to discharge pesticides into rivers, lakes, streams, and other bodies of water regulated under the Clean Water Act. Who does that benefit? Certainly not the environment or people living near bodies of water! International trade agreements also threaten to restrict transparency about food  how it's produced, and where it comes from. In addition to hampering GMO labeling efforts in the US, provisions in both the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) would also effectively force participating nations to eliminate country of origin from their food labels or run the risk of being sued for harming trade.  It seems the reason why these industries are spending so much money and going to such great lengths to eliminate transparency about toxic exposures and potentially harmful substances in our food supply is because they too can see that the jig is almost up. The situation is simply unsustainable. It's only a matter of time before the human lifespan begins to dwindle in response to excessive toxic exposures  people's health is already being compromised at an ever-earlier age.   These industries are really just grasping for straws right now, trying to hang on for as long as they can, until the whole system falls apart  as it must, eventually. But just because the opposition is great, that doesn't mean we quit fighting to turn the system around. On the contrary, now is the time to press on with greater resolve. I believe we can still avoid a lot of hardship and misery by standing up for what's right, and right now, that includes pressing our US Senators to reject HR 1599.

But according to a new report by Earth Open Source, one of the biggest concerns may be something that you're totally in the dark about, namely birth defects.  Research published last year shows that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, causes birth defects in frogs and chicken embryos at far lower levels than used in agricultural and garden applications.  The malformations primarily affected the:  Skull  Face  Midline and developing brain  Spinal cord   Other independent scientific research has also found that glyphosate causes:     Endocrine disruption   DNA damage     Developmental toxicity   Neurotoxicity     Reproductive toxicity   Cancer      Dr. Mercola Recommends...  Every ""Like"" Helps Support This Cause  Many of these effects were apparent at much lower doses than the typical levels of pesticide residues found in food Yet despite the evidence, which strongly suggests that the precautionary principle should be applied, regulators are turning a blind eye. According to the Earth Open Source report:  ""The EU Commission dismissed these findings, based on a rebuttal provided by the German Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL). BVL cited unpublished industry studies to back its claim that glyphosate was safe."" [Emphasis mine.]  Massive, Uncontrolled Experiments are Currently Taking Place The above-mentioned study was prompted after reports surfaced of high rates of birth defects in areas of Argentina growing genetically modified (GM) Roundup Ready soy. This GM soy has been genetically altered to be tolerant to otherwise lethal doses of Roundup. What this means is that the plants absorb the herbicide and survive, which makes them vessels of potentially high levels of glyphosate. Naturally, when you eat this crop, you also ingest glyphosate, which makes these findings extremely disturbing According to the lead author:  ""From the ecotoxicological point of view, what is happening in Argentina is a massive experiment. It is a cautionary tale of what could happen in any country that adopts glyphosate-tolerant GM crops on a large scale.""  Unfortunately for American consumers, the United States is a major grower of genetically modified crops. For example, in the US, over 90 percent of all canola grown is GM Roundup Ready canola, as is about 90 percent of US soybeans, and about 70 percent of all corn and cotton. And according to the featured report, industry and regulators KNEW that glyphosate causes deformities as early as the 1980's, but withheld the information from the public  Quite shockingly, the amount of glyphosate residue you can be exposed to through food is remarkably high, in terms of being close to the maximum residue limit (MRL) allowed. According to the featured report, the highest MRL for glyphosate in food and feed products in the EU is 20 mg/kg. GM soybeans have been found to contain residue levels as high as 17 mg/kg, and malformations in frog and chicken embryos occurred at 2.03 mg/kg! That's 10 times lower than the MRL.  According to GMO expert Jeffrey Smith, there is so much glyphosate in GM soybeans, when they were introduced Europe had to increase their allowable residue levels by 200-fold! The report does mention that an injected dose, which is how the animal study was done, is not the same as ingesting that amount. However, it strongly suggests that we need to thoroughly investigate just how much glyphosate humans and animals can safely ingest. At present, no such investigation has taken place, and regulatory agencies choose instead to rely in industry studies showing that glyphosate is safe Roundup Lethal to Amphibians In another study on the effect of Roundup on aquatic and terrestrial amphibians, researchers discovered that the herbicide can be lethal, and may cause amphibian population declines. According to the authors, previous studies have shown that Roundup may be ""highly lethal"" to North American tadpoles. Here, they sought to determine whether the herbicide might also be lethal under more natural conditions, and in post-metamorphic amphibians.  Turns out the answer is a resounding yes. The author writes:  ""I assembled communities of three species of North American tadpoles in outdoor pond mesocosms that contained different types of soil (which can absorb the pesticide) and applied Roundup as a direct overspray. After three weeks, Roundup killed 96100 percent of larval amphibians (regardless of soil presence).    I then exposed three species of juvenile (post-metamorphic) anurans to a direct overspray of Roundup in laboratory containers. After one day, Roundup killed 6886 percent of juvenile amphibians. These results suggest that Roundup, a compound designed to kill plants, can cause extremely high rates of mortality to amphibians that could lead to population declines.""  InfertilityAnother Potential Health Risk of GM Foods There's plenty of evidence suggesting that GM foods may pose a threat to future generations in more ways than one. Aside from birth defects, reproductive failure is another recurring theme in independent research. For example:  A 2009 Brazilian study found that female rats fed GM soy for 15 months showed significant changes in their uterus and reproductive cycle, compared to rats fed organic soy or those raised without soy. The glyphosate in the soybeans is believed to be the cause of the problem as it throws off the delicate hormonal balance that governs the whole reproductive cycle.  In a 2009 French study , scientists discovered that glyphosate can kill the cells in the outer layer of the human placenta (the trophoblast membrane), which in turn can kill the placenta. Only 1/500th the amount needed to kill weeds was able to kill the cells. The amount is so small, according to the study authors, the ""residual levels to be expected, especially in food and feed derived from R[oundup] formulation-treated crops"" could be enough to ""cause cell damage and even [cell] death.""  A Canadian epidemiological study, which looked at nearly 4,000 pregnancies in 1,898 couples, women exposed to glyphosate during the three months before getting pregnant had a significantly higher risk ofmiscarriages, especially for those above 34 years of age. Fathers who were exposed to glyphosate before their wives got pregnant showed an increase in early delivery and spontaneous abortions.  A study on male rabbits showed that glyphosate can cause a reduction in sexual activity and sperm concentration, and an increase in dead or abnormal sperm.  In 2005, Irina Ermakova with the Russian National Academy of Sciences reported that more than half the babies from mother rats fed GM soy died within three weeks. This was also five times higher than the 10 percent death rate of the non-GMO soy group. The babies in the GM group were also smaller and could not reproduce. When Ermakova fed male rats GM soy, their testicles changed from the normal pink to dark blue.  Italian scientists similarly found changes in mice testes (PDF), including damaged young sperm cells. Furthermore, the DNA of embryos from parent mice fed GM soy functioned differently.   Say NO to GMO's! These GM crops can now be found in nearly all processed foods, in the form of high fructose corn syrup, corn oil, canola oil, soybean oil, soy lectin and so on. This means that if you eat processed foods, you are virtually guaranteed to consume GM ingredients. Children are clearly at greatest risk, as no one knows exactly what kind of harm these experimental foods may cause over an entire human lifetime, let alone two or more generations. So what can you do? In your own home, you can:  Avoid using glyphosate-containing weed killers on your lawn and garden, and  Buy organic foods to avoid both genetically modified crops and agricultural chemicals like glyphosate   If you still want to purchase some processed foods, make sure you avoid those that may contain GM ingredients. This would be any food product containing any of the following ingredients, or any derivative thereof, unless labeled USDA 100% Organic:       Soy    Sugar from sugar beets      Corn    Hawaiian papaya      Cottonseed (used in vegetable cooking oils)    Some varieties of zucchini      Canola (canola oil)    Crookneck squash     Common derivatives include items such as:  High fructose corn syrup  Soy lecithin   Other common food ingredients you may not be aware are genetically modified include:  Milk containing rbGH  Rennet (containing genetically modified enzymes) used to make hard cheeses  Aspartame (NutraSweet)   More Information Fortunately, you and I do have the power to turn this horrific trend of genetically engineered foods around, but it will require steadfast avoidance of all GM foods, which by and large means avoiding processed foods that contain any of the ingredients or derivatives listed aboveunless it's USDA Certified 100% Organic.  It will also require steadfast sharing of information to educate those around you about the problems with GM foods and why it's so essential to vote them off the market with your pocket book. It's quite clear that we cannot win this fight through regulatory action, but we can still force it off our shelves and out of our fields if sufficient amounts of people simply refuse to buy these products. On an individual level, you can get educated on GM foods, which are prevalent in your supermarket right now (virtually all processed foods contain GM ingredients, unless they are certified organic), so you can opt out of including these foods in your diet. To start,  I urge you to print out and use the Non-GMO Shopping Guide, created by the Institute for Responsible Technology. Share it with your friends and family, and post it to your social networks. You can also download a free iPhone application, available in the iTunes store. You can find it by searching for ShopNoGMO in the applications.

Lessons from 50 Years of Utilizing the Birth Control Pill,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2010/05/15/the-pill-at-50-sex-freedom-and-paradox.aspx,"The birth control pill, which the FDA approved 50 years ago, was the first medicine designed to be taken by people who were not sick. In 1999, it was called the most important scientific advance of the 20th century by The Economist. Many women still question whether the health risks outweigh the benefits. In the article linked below, Time Magazine explores the Pill in depth, eventually concluding that:  As the conversation of the past half-century makes plain, science alone will not resolve questions that reach this deep into our relations with one another.

"Natural Birth Control Methods Just as Effective, Much Safer Than ...",http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2006/11/16/natural-birth-control-methods-just-as-effective-much-safer-than-hormones.aspx,"This interesting guide lists a number of birth control techniques that can be used instead of pills or patches.The article recommends practicing two or more natural birth control methods at the same time, and lists such methods as:Withdrawal: The man withdraws his penis from the woman's vagina before he ejaculates. This doesn't always work; even before ejaculation, the penis releases small amounts of semen that can contain sperm, so this is only 60 to 80 percent successful at preventing pregnancy.Calendar Method: Abstention from sex during the week the woman is ovulating. This technique works best when a woman's menstrual cycle is very regular. The calendar method doesn't work very well for couples who use it by itself (about a 75 percent success rate), but it can be effective when combined with the temperature and mucus methods described below.The temperature method: This is a way to pinpoint the day of ovulation so that sex can be avoided for a few days before and after. It involves taking the basal body temperature (your temperature upon first waking) each morning with an accurate ""basal"" thermometer, and noting the rise in temperaturethat occurs after ovulation. Illness or lack of sleep can change body temperature and make this method unreliable by itself, but when it is combined with the mucus method, it can be an accurate way of assessing fertility. The two methods combined can have a success rate as high as 98 percent.The mucus method: This involves tracking changes in the amount and texture of vaginal discharge, which reflect rising levels of estrogen in the body. For the first few days after your period, there is often no discharge, but there will be a cloudy, tacky mucus as estrogen starts to rise. When the discharge starts to increase in volume and becomes clear and stringy, ovulation is near. A return to the tacky, cloudy mucus or no discharge means that ovulation has passed.Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM): Some experts believe that exclusively breastfeeding protects a woman from pregnancy by curbing hormones that trigger ovulation. However, every woman's body responds differently to the hormonal influences of breastfeeding, so this is an unreliable method. [+] Sources and References     Pregnancy Guide November 2, 2006"
GM Foods: The Shocking Cause of Birth Defects,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/05/13/ge-food-cause-birth-defects.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Roundup Ready soy is now being cultivated on a massive scale across the globe, along with the exponentially increasing use of the herbicide Roundup. Monsanto's ""Roundup Ready"" soy beans are genetically modified to survive otherwise lethal doses of glyphosate, the active ingredient in the company's herbicide Roundup.  It's a win-win for Monsanto. But it's a loss for just about everyone else. One of the countries most affected by genetically engineered soy is Argentina, whose population is being sickened by massive spraying of herbicides across the country's Pampas (the country's ""fertile plain"").  Argentina's Pampas used to be dotted with dairy and vegetable farms, but now, large-scale soybean monoculture blankets most of their cultivated land, making them especially susceptible to the damaging effects of genetically engineered soy. The impact can be better appreciated by considering the following statistics:  Soy is the main income source for landowners and the statesoybeans are considered a ""gold mine"" by Argentinians; soy exports generate 16,000 million dollars a year  The area cultivated with soy has reached 19 million hectares, representing 56 percent of Argentina's cultivated land1 98 percent of Argentina's soybean production is genetically modified2 190 million liters of glyphosate (the active agent in Roundup) are sprayed in Argentina annually, which is leading to not only illness among the population but to widespread deforestation, as trees are among the victims these herbicides leave in their wake of destruction   Soya burgers are a staple of today's Argentinian diet. Argentinian children were consuming so much genetically engineered soy that they began developing breasts from the estrogenic effects, before authorities stepped in with warnings.  Studies also strongly suggest that the glyphosate that these crops are doused with can cause cancer and birth deformities; both of which are occurring at increasing rates in areas where spraying is done. Sterility and miscarriages are also increasing. Experts warn that in 10 to 15 years, rates of cancer, infertility, and endocrine dysfunction could reach catastrophic levels in Argentina. But few people are listening.  'It's Food for Today, Hunger and Cancer for Tomorrow'  The immediate symptoms are always the same for Argentinian bystanders in the spray zone: dizziness, allergic reactions and itching, mouth swelling, and general malaise that's similar to the feeling of coming down with the flu. People are warned to stay inside when spraying is underway, but they report getting sick in spite of this confinement.  When those affected visit their physicians, they're told it's ""all in their heads."" Authorities also turn a deaf earas does the government when it's presented with scientific evidence of the dangerous effects of Monsanto's products for their people and environment. Fortunately, increasing numbers of scientists are now starting to speak out. For example, the engineers' school in Santiago del Estero announced that chemicals are causing 100 babies to be born with deformities every year. One of the most influential studies was conducted by one of Argentina's leading scientists, Andres Carrasco, who works in Argentina's Ministry of Science.   Andrs Carrasco Attacked for Exposing the Truth  Embryonic specialist Andres Carrasco decided to investigate the health effects of glyphosate for himself after hearing so many reports by desperate peasant and indigenous communities who were suffering from exposure to toxic herbicides. According to Dr. Carrasco, his studies show glyphosate exposure can cause defects in the brain, intestines, and hearts of amphibian fetuses, and these results can be applied to humans. Moreover, the amount of Roundup used on genetically engineered soy fields was as much as 1,500 times greater than that which created the defects. According to an article in Grain, the biotech industry ""mounted an unprecedented attack on Carrasco, ridiculing his research and even issuing personal threats."" In addition, four men arrived unannounced at his laboratory and were extremely aggressive, attempting to interrogate Carrasco and obtain details of his study.   ""It was a violent, disproportionate, dirty reaction,"" he said. ""I hadn't even discovered anything new, only confirmed conclusions that others had reached.""  The conclusions to which Carrasco is referring are those from independent researchers who have found strong evidence glyphosate causes the following:    Endocrine disruption DNA damage   Developmental toxicity Neurotoxicity   Reproductive toxicity Cancer    Carrasco's and others' work point to the fact that the public, in Argentina and elsewhere, is being subject to a massive biological experiment involving the effects of genetic manipulation of the food supply. Genetically engineered food products have NEVER been tested for safetyso the long-term effects are largely unknown. The warnings science has provided demand a thorough investigation into just how much glyphosate human beings and animals can safely ingest. At present, no such investigation has taken place, and most regulatory agencies choose instead to rely in industry studies claiming glyphosate is safe. Roundup has been shown to be lethal to amphibians. Are we next? Where is the tipping point for the human race? How much more can we tolerate in the adulteration of our food supply?  Why We MUST Insist on Labeling of Genetically Engineered Foods  Labeling may be the only way to stop the proliferation of genetically engineered foods in the U.S., but simple petitions will likely fail. We strongly supported state initiatives, such as California's ballot initiative to require labeling for genetically engineered foods sold in their state.  Many don't fully appreciate the strategy of seeking to have genetically engineered foods labeled in California. The belief is that large food companies would refuse to have dual labeling; one for California and another for the rest of the country. It would be very expensive, not to mention a logistical nightmare. To avoid the dual labeling, many would likely opt to not use genetically engineered ingredients in their product, especially if the new label would be the equivalent of a skull and crossbones. This is why we were so committed to this initiative. Powerful confirmation of this belief occurred in early 2012 when both Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo Inc. chose to alter one of their soda ingredients as a result of California's labeling requirements for carcinogens:3  ""Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. are changing the way they make the caramel coloring used in their sodas as a result of a California law that mandates drinks containing a certain level of carcinogens bear a cancer warning label. The companies said the changes will be expanded nationally to streamline their manufacturing processes. They've already been made for drinks sold in California.""   This is a PERFECT example of the national impact a California labeling law can, and no doubt WILL, have. While California is the only state requiring the label to state that the product contains the offending ingredient, these companies are switching their formula for the entire US market, rather than have two different labels. According to USA Today:  ""A representative for Coca-Cola, Diana Garza Ciarlante, said the company directed its caramel suppliers to modify their manufacturing processes to reduce the levels of the chemical 4-methylimidazole, which can be formed during the cooking process and as a result may be found in trace amounts in many foods. 'While we believe that there is no public health risk that justifies any such change, we did ask our caramel suppliers to take this step so that our products would not be subject to the requirement of a scientifically unfounded warning,' Garza-Giarlante said in an email.""

Learn More About Genetically Engineered Foods  Due to lack of labeling, many Americans are still unfamiliar with what genetically engineered foods are.

You can also download a free iPhone application, available in the iTunes store. You can find it by searching for ShopNoGMO in the applications.  Your BEST strategy, however, is to simply buy USDA 100% Organic products whenever possible, (as these do not permit genetically engineered ingredients) or buy whole fresh produce and meat from local farmers. The majority of the genetically modified organisms (GMOs) you're exposed to are via processed foods, so by cooking from scratch with whole foods, you can be sure you're not inadvertently consuming something laced with altered ingredients. When you do purchase processed food, avoid products containing anything related to corn or soy that are not 100 percent organic, as any foods containing these two non-organic ingredients are virtually guaranteed to contain genetically engineered ingredients, as well as toxic herbicide residues.

Just Say No to Birth Control Pills 10/27/04,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2004/10/27/birth-control-part-two.aspx,
A Healthy Diet Can Help Prevent Birth Defects,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/10/18/probiotics-may-reduce-risk-of-birth-defects.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  There is rarely a more nutritionally demanding time during a woman's life than pregnancy (and later breastfeeding), when your intake of nutrients from foods and supplements are needed not only to keep your body running but also to nourish and support your rapidly growing baby.  Proper nutrition is crucial at all stages of fetal development, and if mom doesn't eat right, her growing baby won't either.  Wholesome Diet Before Pregnancy Reduces Risk of Birth Defects  If you're a woman in your childbearing years and you're planning to have children any time soon, it's imperative that you start eating healthy now.  New research shows that women who ate a vegetable-rich diet during the year before pregnancy had a significantly lower risk of having a baby with certain birth defects as women who ate an unhealthy high-sugar diet. Specifically, compared to those who ate unhealthy, women who ate healthy experienced:  One-half lower risk of anencephaly, a neural-tube defect that interferes with brain development and often results in miscarriage  Up to a one-third lower risk of cleft lip  One-quarter lower risk of cleft palate  One-fifth lower risk of spina bifida, another neural-tube defect   Unfortunately, the researchers lumped saturated fats in with ""unhealthy fat,"" when they are actually crucial for pregnant women (and everyone, for that matter), and incorrectly labeled whole grains as healthy, when the majority of Americans need to limit them. So I believe their results may have been skewed and may have shown an even greater benefit if a true healthy diet had been defined (as an aside, the commonly referred to ""Mediterranean diet"" vilifies saturated fats, but a true traditional Mediterranean diet was by no means low in saturated fats) nonetheless, you can still get the gist of the importance of eating whole foods vs. unhealthy, high-sugar alternatives.  Additionally many of the benefits of the Mediterranean diet may actually be related to the soil of the Mediterranean, which is very high in sulfur so the foods grown there provide much higher sulfur levels. So people eating similar foods not grown in sulfur-rich soils may not obtain the same benefits. It is also important to note that the benefits occurred among women who ate healthy in the year prior to pregnancy, as it takes time for your body, and your developing baby, to be able to reap all the benefits of healthy nutrition. The later in the pregnancy these changes are implemented the less the benefit. Ideally one should be eating healthy foods prior to conception. If you wait to start eating healthy until you are already pregnant, the fetus will miss out on important nutrients in the first crucial weeks of development, when the foundations of your baby's organs are forming. Many are not aware of this, but it is between 17 and 56 days of pregnancy that the embryo is most vulnerable and susceptible to influences that may interfere with its normal development. So not only is it crucial to avoid exposures to pesticides and other chemicals during this time, but it's also very important that your nutritional requirements are fully met from the moment conception takes place.  What Nutrients are Crucial for Pregnant Women (and Women of Childbearing Age)?  Healthy nutrition cannot be limited to a handful of nutrients; it can only be achieved by eating a variety of whole, high-quality foods daily. I cannot stress this enough, as if you seek to make up for a diet of processed foods by taking a multi-vitamin or eating a salad here and there, you are deceiving yourself and missing the point -- and the benefits. For a succinct and easy-to-follow overview of the types of foods and nutrients that will support a healthy pregnancy, read my nutrition plan. Ideally, by the time you enter pregnancy you will already be in the Intermediate or Advanced stage, but even the Beginner stage is far better that the typical American diet.  As you'll see, it is focused on minimizing processed foods while increasing your intake of vegetables, healthy fats and high-quality sources of protein, all of which are ideal for nurturing a growing fetus. Some of the highlights you'll want to be sure to include are: Vitamin B12  Vitamin B12 is one of the eight B complex vitamins and is naturally present in foods that come from animals, including meat, fish, eggs, milk and milk products. B12 is critical for normal neurological development and maintenance, and shortages can result in permanent birth defects. Note: If you eat a vegan diet, you are likelyto be dangerously deficient in vitamin B12.  Folic Acid in the form of Metafolate  Another B complex vitamin (vitamin B9), folic acid deficiency at the time of conception is known to increase the risk for birth defects such as spina bifida. Many women are aware of this and take folic acid supplements in their prenatal vitamins, but many are not aware that in order for folic acid to perform its crucial duties in your body, and for your fetus, it must first be activated into the biologically active form  L-5-MTHF.  This is the form that's most usable by your body and the form that's able to cross the blood-brain barrier to carry out important brain functions. Nearly half of the population has difficulty converting folic acid to the bioactive 5-MTHF form because of a genetic reduction in enzyme activity, so it's important to look for metafolate or metafolin in your multi-vitamin instead of folic acid. Be sure to read the label closely, as many companies don't use the bioactive form because it is too expensive and about 10 times more costly. Of course even better than a supplement would be a wide variety of healthy, fresh, organically grown vegetables, which will supply not only folic acid in the correct form but all the other important accessory micronutrients.   Animal-based Omega-3 Fats  Most women have major deficiencies of animal-based omega-3 fat like EPA and DHA, which is unfortunate because fetal cells cannot form omega-3 fats, meaning a fetus must obtain all of its omega-3 fatty acids frommother's diet. A mother's dietary intake and plasma concentrations of DHA directly influence the DHA status of the developing fetus. DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is so essential to a child's development that if a mother and infant are deficient in it, the child's nervous system and immune system may never fully develop, and it can cause a lifetime of unexplained emotional, learning, and immune system disorders. DHA makes up 15 percent to 20 percent of the cerebral cortex and 30 percent to 60 percent of the retina so it is absolutely necessary for normal development of the fetusin utero, and as a baby post birth. Omega-3s are simply powerhouse nutrients to ensure that your baby will develop properly and reach its highest potential. These nutrients help to maximize the intelligence of your child, and protect your baby from brain injuries such as autism, pervasive developmental delay, and ADHD. Studies have shown that sufficient levels of omega-3 fats optimize brain growth in children, especially during the third trimester. But because the fetus depends on the mother's DHA sources, the constant drain on a mother's DHA reserves can easily lead to a deficiency and some researchers believe that preeclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure) and postpartum depression could be linked to a DHA deficiency. The DHA in animal-based omega-3 fats will also help to prevent the vast majority of premature deliveries. In my view, krill oil is your best option when it comes to obtaining important high-quality animal-based omega-3 fats. It contains EPA and DHA in a double-chain phospholipid structure that makes it far more absorbable than the omega-3s in fish oil. Krill is a clean, sustainable resource and also does not present the contamination risks that eating fish does. I do not advise pregnant women to eat fish, even though itcontains omega-3, most sources are contaminated with mercury and other toxins. It is important to note that plant-based omega 3 fats (such as flaxseeds) do not provide the same benefits as animal-based, because most of us can't convert the ALA in plant-based fats to the appropriate amount of DHA that is required. You can consume plant-based omega-3s additionally, I just don't recommend making them your sole source.  Fermented Foods and/or Probiotics  Nearly everyone can benefit from optimizing the balance of good vs. bad bacteria in their gut using probiotics, but if you are pregnant or planning to be, this is of utmost importance to you and your new baby. One of the best ways to do this is to avoid sugar and processed foods and to include fermented foods in your diet. Additionally, taking a high-quality probiotic may help you to regain your figure after pregnancy, but the benefits go well beyond this. Research shows giving pregnant women and newborns doses of good bacteria can:  Protect babies from developing eczema in childhood  Help prevent childhood allergies by training infants' immune systems to resist allergic reactions  Help optimize your baby's weight later in life  Improve the symptoms of colic, decreasing average crying times by about 75 percent  Reduce your risk of premature labor   The best way to ensure optimal gut flora is to regularly consume traditionally fermented foods, which are naturally rich in probiotics. This includes Lassi, kefir, sauerkraut and other fermented veggies, natto, kim chee and tempeh. A high-quality probiotic supplement is also an option, especially if you don't eat many fermented foods.  Vitamin D   I've included vitamin D here even though your main source of it should be from the sun, not from food. Along with reducing your risk of premature birth, studies have found that vitamin D may protect against a number of birth defects and autism, as well as pregnancy complications like high blood pressure. It is absolutely imperative that pregnant women maintain a blood level of between 50 and 70 ng/ml of 25 hydroxy D, and I amhopeful that in the not too distant future it will be mandatory for pregnant women to receive regular vitamin D blood test levels. So please watch my free one-hour vitamin D lecture to find out how to get your levels optimized. Ideally you should get it by having UVB exposure on at least half of your skin. You can do this for free in the summer with sunlight but the rest of the year for many, the next best option is a safe tanning bed. Yourother option would be oral vitamin D3.  If you are unable to have sunshine or a safe tanning bed exposure than it will be VERY important to take oral vitamin D3. The average adult dose is 8000 units. Your prenatal supplement will likely only contain 1000 units of vitamin D3 or less, so make sure you get the correct dose and to check your blood level as many people need far more than 8000 units a day, and some may require less. Also please understand that you will get between 10,000 and 40,000 units of vitamin D every day you properly suntan.  An Important (and All-Too-Common) Food to Avoid   Just as it's imperative to include the right foods in your diet, it's also crucial to limit those that can be harmful. Pregnant women are often warned about the ""dangers"" of eating undercooked meat and drinking unpasteurized milk, even though those risks are largely unfounded as long as the foods come from clean, safe, high-quality sources (i.e. NOT CAFOs (confined animal feeding operations). What you will rarely hear, however -- but that should be explained to every pregnant woman at her first midwife or OB visit -- is that there is powerful emerging evidence of the danger of excess fructose consumption. It will increase insulin and leptin resistance and also radically increase total inflammation in your body, which can cause pregnancy complications.  So please be sure and count your fructose grams (it's often hidden in processed foods) and keep them below 25 grams per day. Fructose is found not only in fresh fruit but also, and more importantly, in soda, cookies, candy, crackers, salad dressing, bread, and countless other processed foods. Fortifying your diet with healthy fresh foods, and avoiding junk food and fast foods, is truly one of the best gifts you can give to your child. The more high-quality foods you consume, the better health start your baby will receive.

Brazil Admits Birth Defects Are Not Caused by Zika Virus,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/08/16/birth-defects-brazil-not-zika-virus.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola Amidst growing fear-based propaganda warning of the threat of Zika virus comes a quiet admission from health officials in Brazil: Zika alone may not be responsible for the rise in birth defects that plagued parts of the country. While there is some evidence suggesting Zika virus may be linked to the birth defect microcephaly, and the virus has been spreading throughout Brazil, rates of the condition have only risen to very high rates in the northeast section of Brazil. Since the virus has spread throughout Brazil, but extremely high rates of microcephaly have not, officials are now being forced to admit that something else is likely at play.  Dr. Fatima Marinho, director of information and health analysis at Brazil's ministry of health, told the journal Nature, ""We suspect that something more than Zika virus is causing the high intensity and severity of cases.""1 Nearly 90 Percent of Brazil Microcephaly Cases Occurred in the Northeast Since last November, more than 1,700 confirmed cases of congenital microcephaly or other birth defects of the central nervous system have been reported in Brazil.  When the cases first began and were reportedly linked to Zika virus, health officials believed they'd see ""an explosion of birth defects"" across Brazil, according to Marinho.2 But that hasn't happened.  Data compiled by Marinho and colleagues, which has been submitted for publication, suggest socio-economic factors may be involved. Most of the women who gave birth to babies with microcephaly were poor and lived in small cities or on the outskirts of big cities.   In addition, the outbreak occurred in a largely poverty-stricken agricultural area of Brazil that uses large amounts of banned pesticides.   Between these factors and the lack of sanitation and widespread vitamin A and zinc deficiency, you have the basic framework for an increase in poor health outcomes among newborn infants in that area.   Environmental pollution and toxic pesticide exposure have been positively linked to a wide array of adverse health effects, including birth defects. For instance:    Vitamin A deficiency has been linked to an increased risk of microcephaly3  The CDC lists malnutrition and exposure to toxic chemicals as known risk factors4  The CDC also notes certain infections during pregnancy, including rubella, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis and others, are risk factors  Data Is Lacking to Confirm Zika-Microcephaly Link It's also been suggested that microcephaly may be the result of Zika virus occurring alongside other infections, such as dengue and chikungunya.  The Brazilian doctor who first reportedly established the link between Zika virus and microcephaly is even considering whether another disease, Bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), may be involved, as BVDV proteins were also detected in the brains of three fetuses with microcephaly.  BVDV causes birth defects in cattle but is not known to infect people. Researchers suggested that infection with Zika virus may make it easier for BVDV to infect humans.5 Adding to the complexities, much of the microcephaly data from Brazil comes from incomplete hospital reports. In most cases, tests to confirm Zika infection were not carried out.  In June 2016, the Zika in Infants and Pregnancy Study was launched in Puerto Rico. It aims to monitor up to 10,000 pregnant women to examine Zika virus along with nutritional, socio-economic and environmental factors and their potential link to birth defects. However, the results of a similar study have only raised further doubts. 12,000 Zika Cases Confirmed in Pregnant Colombian Women  Zero Microcephaly Cases According to a report by the New England Complex Systems Institute (NECSI), there are serious questions about whether Zika virus is the cause of microcephaly. They cite the preliminary results of a New England Journal of Medicine study, which followed nearly 12,000 pregnant Colombian women infected with Zika virus.6 No cases of microcephaly were reported in their babies as of May 2016, yet four cases of microcephaly were reported among women who had Zika infection with no symptoms and were therefore not included in the study. The researchers then speculated that this means there could be four times as many cases of Zika infection that are unreported, for a total of at least 60,000 Zika-infected pregnancies in Colombia.  Using this data, an analysis revealed the rate of microcephaly to be what would be expected in any area, whether Zika is in the picture or not, which is 2 cases in 10,000 births.7 According to NECSI:8  ""This gives a consistent interpretation that there is no direct link between Zika and microcephaly except for random co-occurrence.    We note that the base rate of microcephaly in the absence of Zika is 140 per year in Colombia, which is consistent with the approximately 50 microcephaly cases in the first [four] months of 2016, only [four] of which have been connected to Zika. When interpreting Zika as the cause, background cases must be subtracted.""  By June 2016, 11 total microcephaly cases had been reported in women with Zika infections in Colombia. If Zika and microcephaly are linked, NECSI pointed out that the total number of microcephaly cases should rise dramatically in the next few months, reaching more than 10 microcephaly-Zika births each week.9 NECSI also suggested, ""An alternative cause of microcephaly in Brazil could be the pesticide pyriproxyfen, which is cross-reactive with retinoic acid, which causes microcephaly, and is being used in drinking water.""10 WHO Expert: Zika Response 'Completely Hysterical'  Florence Fouque, a World Health Organization (WHO) expert on animals that carry viruses, called the public response to the Zika virus ""completely hysterical.""11 She blamed the hysteria on the findings that the virus affects pregnant women and can be sexually transmitted.   ""It's like AIDS,"" she told PRI. ""People make this link and that's why they are really afraid.""12 At one restaurant in downtown Miami, Florida, where a handful of Zika cases were detected in August 2016, insect repellent was placed on all the tables.13  Even Oliver Brady, an epidemiologist with the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine who was asked by Brazilian officials to assess the Zika-microcephaly situation, said there's no conclusive evidence that Zika causes birth defects in humans.   He told PRI that while animal studies have shown the virus attacks brain cells, this isn't ""final proof:""14   ""You see that with a lot of arboviruses [viruses spread by mosquitoes and other insects]  They have pathogenic qualities and if you put them in the right tissue then they will cause some sort of damage. And they tend to be quite transmissible across a variety of barriers anyway.     So it doesn't necessarily mean that that's the mechanism that's happening out there in the field, even if it does work in the lab.""  National Institutes of Health Launches Trial for Experimental Zika Vaccine  The U.S. is among those ignoring data and rushing to launch a vaccine against Zika virus before it's even known whether it's causing birth defects. What is known, however, is that experimental vaccines have real risks, which are often downplayed in the wake of perceived global ""emergencies"" such as Zika. In August 2016, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) announced it launched a clinical trial of an experimental Zika vaccine  again, before there is conclusive proof that Zika causes microcephaly. Eighty healthy volunteers between the ages of 18 and 35 will be vaccinated with varying doses of the experimental vaccine. No placebos will be given. The vaccine is said to be similar to a West Nile Virus vaccine that was previously developed by the NIH, but has not yet been approved. This alone should be a red flag, as should the disastrous outcome of the CYD-TDV vaccine, the first dengue vaccine approved by WHO in April 2016.  Dengue Vaccine Hints at Potential Problems With Zika Vaccines Dr. Scott B. Halstead, former senior adviser of the Dengue Vaccine Initiative and the founder of Children's Vaccine Initiative, told the University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy:15   ""It's happened. We have a vaccine that enhances dengue  It's clear as the nose on my face: Vaccine recipients less than 5 years old had five to seven times more rates of hospitalizations for severe dengue virus than placebo controls.""   He's referring to the results of a three-year study published in the New England Journal of Medicine,16 which suggest the vaccine causes antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE). Halstead explained:17 ""Over time, you make and keep protective levels of antibody from the initial infection, but you lose the cross-reactive antibodies  That allows a second dengue infection to cause severe illness  ""  At this point, it's unknown how this relates to Zika virus, but it's possible that pre-existing immunity to dengue may lead to more severe infection with Zika virus. The University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy quoted concerns voiced by Dr. Philip K. Russell, the former director of the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research and commander of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command, as well as founding president and chairman of the Sabin Vaccine Institute:   ""Russell said that the fact that Zika is occurring in areas where dengue has been endemic hints at a serious potential problem with ADE and Zika vaccine development. 'The current epidemic of Zika, which is usually mild disease, is made a lot worse in these populations,' Russell said. 'I think there's a major effect, but the studies haven't been done yet to sort that out.'  More Toxic Exposures Are Not the Answer Many areas are ramping up pesticide spraying to combat Zika virus. A Clean Water Act permit is generally required to spray pesticides in areas where they might end up in water. The permit is intended to keep the toxic chemicals from contaminating water, but now the Zika virus has been used as an excuse to do away with this common-sense precaution.  The language was inserted into the Zika Vector Control Act, which was passed by the House of Representatives. It would exempt pesticide applicators from needing a Clean Water Act permit, even when spraying near water. Critics argued the bill would do little to help fight Zika virus, since mosquito-control agencies already have authority to apply pesticides in emergency situations to prevent the spread of infectious disease without applying for permits. Opponents say the bill has nothing to do with combating Zika and, instead, has been on the table for years, with the majority pushing for its passage ""under whatever name"" was convenient at the time.18 A White House spokesman also said it hasn't ruled out relaxing restrictions on some pesticides to fight Zika.19 By removing requirements for permits when spraying pesticides near water, it's likely the use of these chemicals will skyrocket, including via aerial spraying, which was recently started in Miami, Florida. Aerial Mosquito Spraying May Increase Autism Risk Unfortunately, many may suffer as a result. In research presented at the Pediatric Academic Societies 2016 Meeting, aerial pesticide exposure was linked to an increased risk of developmental delays and autism spectrum disorder among children.20 The study compared children living in zip codes where aerial pesticide spraying was used each summer to combat mosquitoes that carry the eastern equine encephalitis virus with children living in non-aerial-spraying zip codes.  Children exposed to the aerial pesticide spraying were about 25 percent more likely to be diagnosed with autism or have a documented developmental delay than those living in areas that used other methods of pesticide application (such as manual spreading of granules).  If authorities use the supposed threat of Zika to increase aerial spraying, it could increase children's risk of brain disorders, which is the opposite of what anti-Zika campaigns are supposed to achieve. Mosquito Experts Admit Zika Threat Risk 'Near Zero' Even mosquito experts are questioning the extent of emergency that actually exists. Chris Barker, Ph.D., a mosquito-borne virus researcher at the University of California, Davis School of Veterinary Medicine, told WebMD:21  ""I think the risk for Zika actually setting up transmission cycles that become established in the continental U.S. is near zero."" Barker expects Zika to go the way of other tropical diseases spread by mosquitoes, such as dengue fever and chikungunya, in the U.S. with small clusters of outbreaks in southern states and little activity elsewhere. You needn't go dousing your backyard in chemicals in an attempt to stay safe from Zika virus (whose connection to birth defects is still being explored).  If, however, mosquitoes are bothersome for you, draining standing water, including pet bowls, gutters, garbage and recycling bins, spare tires, bird baths, children's toys and so on, is important. This is where mosquitoes breed, so if you eliminate standing water you'll eliminate many mosquitoes. A simple house fan could also help keep mosquitoes at bay if you're having a get-together in your backyard or, for a longer-term solution, try installing a bat house (bats are voracious consumers of insects, especially mosquitoes). Regularly consuming garlic may also help protect against mosquito bites, as may the following natural insect repellants:   Cinnamon leaf oil (one study found it was more effective at killing mosquitoes than DEET22)   Clear liquid vanilla extract mixed with olive oil  Wash with citronella soap, and then put some 100 percent pure citronella essential oil on your skin. Java Citronella is considered the highest quality citronella on the market  Catnip oil (according to one study, this oil is 10 times more effective than DEET23) [+] Sources and References     Nature July 25, 2016   PRI August 2, 2016   Science Daily June 24, 2016   USA Today August 3, 2016   Reuters August 3, 2016   BBC August 4, 2016   Time April 30, 2016       1,2,5Nature July 25, 20163Obstet Gynecol. 1959 Mar;13(3):299-301.4CDC, Facts About Microcephaly6New England Journal of Medicine May 19, 20167Science Daily June 24, 20168,10New England Complex Systems Institute June 22, 20169Science Daily June 28, 201611,12,14PRI August 2, 201613BBC August 4, 201615,17University of Minnesota Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy July 28, 201616N Engl J Med 2015; 373:1195-120618Think Progress May 25, 201619Reuters August 3, 201620Science Daily April 30, 201621WebMD May 26, 201622J Agric Food Chem. 2004 Jul 14;52(14):4395-400.23Science Daily August 28, 2001"
The Link Between Birth Control Pills and Depression,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2016/10/20/birth-control-pills-depression.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola Birth  control pills are the most popular form of contraception among U.S. women. They're  taken by 16 percent of this population, while just over 7 percent use  long-acting reversible forms of contraception, such as a hormonal intrauterine  device or implant. What  these pills, devices and implants have in common is that they're forms of hormonal  birth control  that is, they contain or release synthetic forms of hormones,  such as estrogen and progestin (a form of progesterone), which work to prevent  pregnancy in various ways.  The problem is that  these sex hormones also affect mood and other biological processes and  artificially manipulating them can lead to many unintended consequences in your  body, some of them uncomfortable and some quite serious, including altering  your mental health. Birth Control Pills Linked to Depression Researchers  from the University of Copenhagen in Denmark analyzed data from  more than 1 million women over a period of 14 years. None of the women, who  were between 15 and 34 years of age, had been diagnosed with depression at the start of the study.1 However, the analysis showed that women who used hormonal  birth control had a 40 percent increased risk of developing depression after  six months compared to women who did not. The risk was greatest among  adolescents. The use of hormonal birth control was also associated with  subsequent use of antidepressant drugs. Certain types of hormonal contraception  had varying risks. Specifically, the use of:  Progestin-only pills led to a  1.3-fold higher rate of antidepressant use Combined birth control pills led to  a 1.2 higher rate Transdermal patch led to a 2-fold increased risk Vaginal ring led to a 1.5-fold increased risk  Anecdotal Reports Suggest Hormonal Contraceptives Lead to Mood Changes Lead study supervisor, Dr. jvind Lidegaard, a professor at  the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, told CNN:2 ""We  have known for decades that women's sex hormones estrogen and progesterone have  an influence on many women's mood.  Therefore,  it is not very surprising that also external artificial hormones acting in the  same way and on the same centers as the natural hormones might also influence  women's mood or even be responsible for depression development."" Despite  this knowledge, many health care professionals are reluctant to suggest that  the risks of hormonal birth control may be too steep for some women, especially  those with a history of depression.  While  scientific validation has yielded some conflicting results, one report in the  Oxford Medical Case Reports journal detailed two cases of women with a history  of depression who developed depressive symptoms after treatment  with hormonal contraceptives (the combined oral contraceptive pill,  progestin-only pill and combined contraceptive vaginal ring).3 Case Reports Detail Onset of Depressive Symptoms After Use of Hormonal Contraceptives In  one case, a 31-year-old woman experienced gradual improvement of her depressive  symptoms after she stopped using the vaginal ring. However, ""a  sudden and acute worsening occurred"" shortly after she started using a combined  birth control pill. About a month later, she again experienced a worsening of  symptoms ""almost simultaneously with the initiation of treatment with combined  contraceptive vaginal ring."" The researchers noted:4 ""HC [Hormonal contraception] was  again interrupted, with a subsequent clear improvement in depressive symptoms.  The patient remained stable without depression for the following [six] months."" In  the second case, a 33-year-old woman developed depressive symptoms shortly  after starting a progestin-only birth control pill. Her symptoms disappeared  completely within one week of stopping the pill. The researchers concluded:5 ""Caution should be used when starting  up treatment with HC in women diagnosed with depression, since it might in some  cases lead to worsening of the depressive symptoms.  Likewise,  attention should be paid to the pre-existing use of HC in women who develop  depression, as discontinuation of HC might in some cases be sufficient to treat  the depression."" Hormonal Contraceptives Are Linked to Glaucoma and Other Health Risks Women who  used oral contraceptives for longer than three years were more than twice as  likely to have been diagnosed with glaucoma, a leading cause of vision loss and  blindness, according to one study.6 The results  were so striking that the researchers recommended women taking the pill for  three or more years be screened for glaucoma and followed closely by an  ophthalmologist. It might seem  unusual that contraceptives could affect your vision, but it's important to understand that there are  body-wide repercussions of artificially manipulating your hormones. Most birth  control pills, patches, vaginal rings and implants contain a combination of the  derivatives of the hormones estrogen and progestin. They work by mimicking  these hormones in your body to fool your reproductive system into producing the  following effects:  Preventing your ovaries from  releasing eggs  Thickening your cervical mucus to  help block sperm from fertilizing an egg  Thinning the lining of your uterus,  which makes it difficult for an egg to implant, should it become fertilized   However, your  reproductive system does not exist in a bubble. It is connected to all of your  other bodily systems, and therefore hormonal contraception is capable of  altering much more than your reproductive status.  According to  one report by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 30  percent of women who have used the pill and nearly half of women using other  hormonal contraception methods stopped their use due to ""dissatisfaction,""  which was most often caused by side effects.7 Potential health risks include:     Cancer: Women who take birth control pills increase  their risk of cervical and breast cancers, and possibly liver cancer as well.  Thinner bones: Women who take birth control pills have lower  bone mineral density (BMD) than women who have never used oral contraceptives.  Heart disease:Long-term use of birth control pills may increase plaque artery buildups in your body that may raise your risk of heart disease.    Fatal blood clots: Birth control pills increase your risk of blood clots  and subsequent stroke.   Impaired muscle gains: Oral contraceptive use may impair muscle gains from resistance exercise training in women.   Long-term sexual  dysfunction: The pill may interfere with a protein that  keeps testosterone unavailable, leading to long-term sexual dysfunction  including decreased desire and arousal.    Migraines  Weight gain and mood  changes   Yeast overgrowth and  infection    The Pill May Be a Libido Killer About  15 percent of women taking oral contraceptives report a decrease in libido,  likely because they lower levels of sex hormones, including testosterone.8 One  study also found seven  times the amount of the libido-killing sex  hormone binding globulin (SHBG) was present in women who took oral contraceptives  compared to women who never used the pill. Even though  SHBG levels declined in women who had stopped taking the pill, they still  remained three to four times higher than they were in women with no history of  using oral contraceptives, which suggests oral contraceptives may kill a  woman's libido for the long-term. Researchers concluded:9 ""Long-term sexual, metabolic, and  mental health consequences might result as a consequence of chronic SHBG  elevation [in women who take, or have taken, oral contraceptives]."" Synthetic Hormones in Drinking Water May Be Increasing Cancer Rates in Men It's  not only women who are at risk from synthetic hormones contained in hormonal  contraceptives. An analysis of data from 100  countries found oral contraceptive use is associated with prostate cancer,  which may be due to exposure to synthetic estrogens excreted by women that end  up in the drinking water supply.10 While it's been argued that only a  small amount of additional estrogen is excreted by a woman using this form of  contraception, this ""small amount"" is compounded by millions of  women, many of whom use the pill for long periods of time. Also, synthetic  estrogen and progestin does not biodegrade rapidly and is far harder to remove  through conventional water purification systems, resulting in greater  accumulation in the environment. While this study did not prove cause  and effect  that is, it did not prove that environmental estrogen from women's  oral contraceptive use causes prostate cancer in men  it did find a  significant association between the two that deserves further investigation,  especially in light of estrogen's well-established role in a wide range of  cancers and the prevalence of hormonal contraceptive use. Non-Hormonal Methods of Contraception Women  and men looking for reversible non-hormonal options of contraception may be  surprised to learn that there are many options. Conventional health care  providers typically steer patients toward the popular hormonal options, but  they are far from the only ones. Barrier  methods, which work by preventing the man's sperm from reaching the woman's egg,  include the diaphragm, cervical cap, sponge and male and female condoms. None  of these are foolproof, which is why many couples use them in combination with  fertility awareness-based methods. Fertility  awareness involves knowing when a woman's fertile period occurs each month, and  then avoiding sexual intercourse during (and just prior to) this time (or using  a barrier method if you do). When  used consistently and correctly, fertility awareness is highly effective at  preventing pregnancy; fewer than 1 to 5 women out of 100 will become pregnant  using fertility awareness in this manner.11 In order to track  fertility, a number of methods can be used by women, including tracking basal  body temperature, mucus production, saliva indicators and cervical position.  Many  women use a combination of methods, and there are also commercially available  ovulation monitors that can be used in conjunction with the other methods.  Ninety-nine percent of U.S. women of reproductive age have used at least one  contraceptive method at some point in their lifetime, with 88 percent choosing  hormonal options.12 However,  you may be relieved to learn that you don't have to subject yourself to the  risks of hormonal contraception, or learn to live with the side effects, in  order to take control of your reproductive health. An experienced holistic  health care provider can help you choose the best non-hormonal contraception  options for you.

GM Foods: The Shocking Cause of Birth Defects,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/05/13/ge-food-cause-birth-defects.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Roundup Ready soy is now being cultivated on a massive scale across the globe, along with the exponentially increasing use of the herbicide Roundup. Monsanto's ""Roundup Ready"" soy beans are genetically modified to survive otherwise lethal doses of glyphosate, the active ingredient in the company's herbicide Roundup.  It's a win-win for Monsanto. But it's a loss for just about everyone else. One of the countries most affected by genetically engineered soy is Argentina, whose population is being sickened by massive spraying of herbicides across the country's Pampas (the country's ""fertile plain"").  Argentina's Pampas used to be dotted with dairy and vegetable farms, but now, large-scale soybean monoculture blankets most of their cultivated land, making them especially susceptible to the damaging effects of genetically engineered soy. The impact can be better appreciated by considering the following statistics:  Soy is the main income source for landowners and the statesoybeans are considered a ""gold mine"" by Argentinians; soy exports generate 16,000 million dollars a year  The area cultivated with soy has reached 19 million hectares, representing 56 percent of Argentina's cultivated land1 98 percent of Argentina's soybean production is genetically modified2 190 million liters of glyphosate (the active agent in Roundup) are sprayed in Argentina annually, which is leading to not only illness among the population but to widespread deforestation, as trees are among the victims these herbicides leave in their wake of destruction   Soya burgers are a staple of today's Argentinian diet. Argentinian children were consuming so much genetically engineered soy that they began developing breasts from the estrogenic effects, before authorities stepped in with warnings.  Studies also strongly suggest that the glyphosate that these crops are doused with can cause cancer and birth deformities; both of which are occurring at increasing rates in areas where spraying is done. Sterility and miscarriages are also increasing. Experts warn that in 10 to 15 years, rates of cancer, infertility, and endocrine dysfunction could reach catastrophic levels in Argentina. But few people are listening.  'It's Food for Today, Hunger and Cancer for Tomorrow'  The immediate symptoms are always the same for Argentinian bystanders in the spray zone: dizziness, allergic reactions and itching, mouth swelling, and general malaise that's similar to the feeling of coming down with the flu. People are warned to stay inside when spraying is underway, but they report getting sick in spite of this confinement.  When those affected visit their physicians, they're told it's ""all in their heads."" Authorities also turn a deaf earas does the government when it's presented with scientific evidence of the dangerous effects of Monsanto's products for their people and environment. Fortunately, increasing numbers of scientists are now starting to speak out. For example, the engineers' school in Santiago del Estero announced that chemicals are causing 100 babies to be born with deformities every year. One of the most influential studies was conducted by one of Argentina's leading scientists, Andres Carrasco, who works in Argentina's Ministry of Science.   Andrs Carrasco Attacked for Exposing the Truth  Embryonic specialist Andres Carrasco decided to investigate the health effects of glyphosate for himself after hearing so many reports by desperate peasant and indigenous communities who were suffering from exposure to toxic herbicides. According to Dr. Carrasco, his studies show glyphosate exposure can cause defects in the brain, intestines, and hearts of amphibian fetuses, and these results can be applied to humans. Moreover, the amount of Roundup used on genetically engineered soy fields was as much as 1,500 times greater than that which created the defects. According to an article in Grain, the biotech industry ""mounted an unprecedented attack on Carrasco, ridiculing his research and even issuing personal threats."" In addition, four men arrived unannounced at his laboratory and were extremely aggressive, attempting to interrogate Carrasco and obtain details of his study.   ""It was a violent, disproportionate, dirty reaction,"" he said. ""I hadn't even discovered anything new, only confirmed conclusions that others had reached.""  The conclusions to which Carrasco is referring are those from independent researchers who have found strong evidence glyphosate causes the following:    Endocrine disruption DNA damage   Developmental toxicity Neurotoxicity   Reproductive toxicity Cancer    Carrasco's and others' work point to the fact that the public, in Argentina and elsewhere, is being subject to a massive biological experiment involving the effects of genetic manipulation of the food supply. Genetically engineered food products have NEVER been tested for safetyso the long-term effects are largely unknown. The warnings science has provided demand a thorough investigation into just how much glyphosate human beings and animals can safely ingest. At present, no such investigation has taken place, and most regulatory agencies choose instead to rely in industry studies claiming glyphosate is safe. Roundup has been shown to be lethal to amphibians. Are we next? Where is the tipping point for the human race? How much more can we tolerate in the adulteration of our food supply?  Why We MUST Insist on Labeling of Genetically Engineered Foods  Labeling may be the only way to stop the proliferation of genetically engineered foods in the U.S., but simple petitions will likely fail. We strongly supported state initiatives, such as California's ballot initiative to require labeling for genetically engineered foods sold in their state.  Many don't fully appreciate the strategy of seeking to have genetically engineered foods labeled in California. The belief is that large food companies would refuse to have dual labeling; one for California and another for the rest of the country. It would be very expensive, not to mention a logistical nightmare. To avoid the dual labeling, many would likely opt to not use genetically engineered ingredients in their product, especially if the new label would be the equivalent of a skull and crossbones. This is why we were so committed to this initiative. Powerful confirmation of this belief occurred in early 2012 when both Coca-Cola Company and PepsiCo Inc. chose to alter one of their soda ingredients as a result of California's labeling requirements for carcinogens:3  ""Coca-Cola Co. and PepsiCo Inc. are changing the way they make the caramel coloring used in their sodas as a result of a California law that mandates drinks containing a certain level of carcinogens bear a cancer warning label. The companies said the changes will be expanded nationally to streamline their manufacturing processes. They've already been made for drinks sold in California.""   This is a PERFECT example of the national impact a California labeling law can, and no doubt WILL, have. While California is the only state requiring the label to state that the product contains the offending ingredient, these companies are switching their formula for the entire US market, rather than have two different labels. According to USA Today:  ""A representative for Coca-Cola, Diana Garza Ciarlante, said the company directed its caramel suppliers to modify their manufacturing processes to reduce the levels of the chemical 4-methylimidazole, which can be formed during the cooking process and as a result may be found in trace amounts in many foods. 'While we believe that there is no public health risk that justifies any such change, we did ask our caramel suppliers to take this step so that our products would not be subject to the requirement of a scientifically unfounded warning,' Garza-Giarlante said in an email.""

Learn More About Genetically Engineered Foods  Due to lack of labeling, many Americans are still unfamiliar with what genetically engineered foods are. We have a plan to change that, and I urge you to participate and to continue learning more about genetically engineered foods and helping your friends and family do the same.  To start, please print out and use the Non-GMO Shopping Guide, created by the Institute for Responsible Technology. Share it with your friends and family, and post it to your social networks. You can also download a free iPhone application, available in the iTunes store. You can find it by searching for ShopNoGMO in the applications.  Your BEST strategy, however, is to simply buy USDA 100% Organic products whenever possible, (as these do not permit genetically engineered ingredients) or buy whole fresh produce and meat from local farmers. The majority of the genetically modified organisms (GMOs) you're exposed to are via processed foods, so by cooking from scratch with whole foods, you can be sure you're not inadvertently consuming something laced with altered ingredients. When you do purchase processed food, avoid products containing anything related to corn or soy that are not 100 percent organic, as any foods containing these two non-organic ingredients are virtually guaranteed to contain genetically engineered ingredients, as well as toxic herbicide residues.

Genetically-Modified (GM) Crops May Cause Birth Defects,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/10/07/are-you-being-kept-in-the-dark-about-birth-defects-from-weed-killers.aspx,"Concerns about Monsanto's herbicide, Roundup, are at an all-time high. But according to a new report by Earth Open Source, one of the biggest concerns may be something that you're totally in the dark about, namely birth defects.  Research published last year shows that glyphosate, the active ingredient in Roundup, causes birth defects in frogs and chicken embryos at far lower levels than used in agricultural and garden applications.  The malformations primarily affected the:  Skull  Face  Midline and developing brain  Spinal cord   Other independent scientific research has also found that glyphosate causes:     Endocrine disruption   DNA damage     Developmental toxicity   Neurotoxicity     Reproductive toxicity   Cancer      Dr. Mercola Recommends...  Every ""Like"" Helps Support This Cause  Many of these effects were apparent at much lower doses than the typical levels of pesticide residues found in food Yet despite the evidence, which strongly suggests that the precautionary principle should be applied, regulators are turning a blind eye. According to the Earth Open Source report:  ""The EU Commission dismissed these findings, based on a rebuttal provided by the German Federal Office for Consumer Protection and Food Safety (BVL). BVL cited unpublished industry studies to back its claim that glyphosate was safe."" [Emphasis mine.]  Massive, Uncontrolled Experiments are Currently Taking Place The above-mentioned study was prompted after reports surfaced of high rates of birth defects in areas of Argentina growing genetically modified (GM) Roundup Ready soy. This GM soy has been genetically altered to be tolerant to otherwise lethal doses of Roundup. What this means is that the plants absorb the herbicide and survive, which makes them vessels of potentially high levels of glyphosate. Naturally, when you eat this crop, you also ingest glyphosate, which makes these findings extremely disturbing According to the lead author:  ""From the ecotoxicological point of view, what is happening in Argentina is a massive experiment. It is a cautionary tale of what could happen in any country that adopts glyphosate-tolerant GM crops on a large scale.""  Unfortunately for American consumers, the United States is a major grower of genetically modified crops. For example, in the US, over 90 percent of all canola grown is GM Roundup Ready canola, as is about 90 percent of US soybeans, and about 70 percent of all corn and cotton. And according to the featured report, industry and regulators KNEW that glyphosate causes deformities as early as the 1980's, but withheld the information from the public  Quite shockingly, the amount of glyphosate residue you can be exposed to through food is remarkably high, in terms of being close to the maximum residue limit (MRL) allowed. According to the featured report, the highest MRL for glyphosate in food and feed products in the EU is 20 mg/kg. GM soybeans have been found to contain residue levels as high as 17 mg/kg, and malformations in frog and chicken embryos occurred at 2.03 mg/kg! That's 10 times lower than the MRL.  According to GMO expert Jeffrey Smith, there is so much glyphosate in GM soybeans, when they were introduced Europe had to increase their allowable residue levels by 200-fold! The report does mention that an injected dose, which is how the animal study was done, is not the same as ingesting that amount. However, it strongly suggests that we need to thoroughly investigate just how much glyphosate humans and animals can safely ingest. At present, no such investigation has taken place, and regulatory agencies choose instead to rely in industry studies showing that glyphosate is safe Roundup Lethal to Amphibians In another study on the effect of Roundup on aquatic and terrestrial amphibians, researchers discovered that the herbicide can be lethal, and may cause amphibian population declines. According to the authors, previous studies have shown that Roundup may be ""highly lethal"" to North American tadpoles. Here, they sought to determine whether the herbicide might also be lethal under more natural conditions, and in post-metamorphic amphibians.  Turns out the answer is a resounding yes. The author writes:  ""I assembled communities of three species of North American tadpoles in outdoor pond mesocosms that contained different types of soil (which can absorb the pesticide) and applied Roundup as a direct overspray. After three weeks, Roundup killed 96100 percent of larval amphibians (regardless of soil presence).    I then exposed three species of juvenile (post-metamorphic) anurans to a direct overspray of Roundup in laboratory containers. After one day, Roundup killed 6886 percent of juvenile amphibians. These results suggest that Roundup, a compound designed to kill plants, can cause extremely high rates of mortality to amphibians that could lead to population declines.""  InfertilityAnother Potential Health Risk of GM Foods There's plenty of evidence suggesting that GM foods may pose a threat to future generations in more ways than one. Aside from birth defects, reproductive failure is another recurring theme in independent research. For example:  A 2009 Brazilian study found that female rats fed GM soy for 15 months showed significant changes in their uterus and reproductive cycle, compared to rats fed organic soy or those raised without soy. The glyphosate in the soybeans is believed to be the cause of the problem as it throws off the delicate hormonal balance that governs the whole reproductive cycle.  In a 2009 French study , scientists discovered that glyphosate can kill the cells in the outer layer of the human placenta (the trophoblast membrane), which in turn can kill the placenta. Only 1/500th the amount needed to kill weeds was able to kill the cells. The amount is so small, according to the study authors, the ""residual levels to be expected, especially in food and feed derived from R[oundup] formulation-treated crops"" could be enough to ""cause cell damage and even [cell] death.""  A Canadian epidemiological study, which looked at nearly 4,000 pregnancies in 1,898 couples, women exposed to glyphosate during the three months before getting pregnant had a significantly higher risk ofmiscarriages, especially for those above 34 years of age. Fathers who were exposed to glyphosate before their wives got pregnant showed an increase in early delivery and spontaneous abortions.  A study on male rabbits showed that glyphosate can cause a reduction in sexual activity and sperm concentration, and an increase in dead or abnormal sperm.  In 2005, Irina Ermakova with the Russian National Academy of Sciences reported that more than half the babies from mother rats fed GM soy died within three weeks. This was also five times higher than the 10 percent death rate of the non-GMO soy group. The babies in the GM group were also smaller and could not reproduce. When Ermakova fed male rats GM soy, their testicles changed from the normal pink to dark blue.  Italian scientists similarly found changes in mice testes (PDF), including damaged young sperm cells. Furthermore, the DNA of embryos from parent mice fed GM soy functioned differently.   Say NO to GMO's! These GM crops can now be found in nearly all processed foods, in the form of high fructose corn syrup, corn oil, canola oil, soybean oil, soy lectin and so on. This means that if you eat processed foods, you are virtually guaranteed to consume GM ingredients. Children are clearly at greatest risk, as no one knows exactly what kind of harm these experimental foods may cause over an entire human lifetime, let alone two or more generations. So what can you do? In your own home, you can:  Avoid using glyphosate-containing weed killers on your lawn and garden, and  Buy organic foods to avoid both genetically modified crops and agricultural chemicals like glyphosate   If you still want to purchase some processed foods, make sure you avoid those that may contain GM ingredients. This would be any food product containing any of the following ingredients, or any derivative thereof, unless labeled USDA 100% Organic:       Soy    Sugar from sugar beets      Corn    Hawaiian papaya      Cottonseed (used in vegetable cooking oils)    Some varieties of zucchini      Canola (canola oil)    Crookneck squash     Common derivatives include items such as:  High fructose corn syrup  Soy lecithin   Other common food ingredients you may not be aware are genetically modified include:  Milk containing rbGH  Rennet (containing genetically modified enzymes) used to make hard cheeses  Aspartame (NutraSweet)   More Information Fortunately, you and I do have the power to turn this horrific trend of genetically engineered foods around, but it will require steadfast avoidance of all GM foods, which by and large means avoiding processed foods that contain any of the ingredients or derivatives listed aboveunless it's USDA Certified 100% Organic.  It will also require steadfast sharing of information to educate those around you about the problems with GM foods and why it's so essential to vote them off the market with your pocket book. It's quite clear that we cannot win this fight through regulatory action, but we can still force it off our shelves and out of our fields if sufficient amounts of people simply refuse to buy these products. On an individual level, you can get educated on GM foods, which are prevalent in your supermarket right now (virtually all processed foods contain GM ingredients, unless they are certified organic), so you can opt out of including these foods in your diet. To start,  I urge you to print out and use the Non-GMO Shopping Guide, created by the Institute for Responsible Technology. Share it with your friends and family, and post it to your social networks. You can also download a free iPhone application, available in the iTunes store. You can find it by searching for ShopNoGMO in the applications.

Just Say No to Birth Control Pills 10/27/04,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2004/10/27/birth-control-part-two.aspx,
"Natural Birth Control Methods Just as Effective, Much Safer Than ...",http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2006/11/16/natural-birth-control-methods-just-as-effective-much-safer-than-hormones.aspx,"This interesting guide lists a number of birth control techniques that can be used instead of pills or patches.The article recommends practicing two or more natural birth control methods at the same time, and lists such methods as:Withdrawal: The man withdraws his penis from the woman's vagina before he ejaculates. This doesn't always work; even before ejaculation, the penis releases small amounts of semen that can contain sperm, so this is only 60 to 80 percent successful at preventing pregnancy.Calendar Method: Abstention from sex during the week the woman is ovulating. This technique works best when a woman's menstrual cycle is very regular. The calendar method doesn't work very well for couples who use it by itself (about a 75 percent success rate), but it can be effective when combined with the temperature and mucus methods described below.The temperature method: This is a way to pinpoint the day of ovulation so that sex can be avoided for a few days before and after. It involves taking the basal body temperature (your temperature upon first waking) each morning with an accurate ""basal"" thermometer, and noting the rise in temperaturethat occurs after ovulation. Illness or lack of sleep can change body temperature and make this method unreliable by itself, but when it is combined with the mucus method, it can be an accurate way of assessing fertility. The two methods combined can have a success rate as high as 98 percent.The mucus method: This involves tracking changes in the amount and texture of vaginal discharge, which reflect rising levels of estrogen in the body. For the first few days after your period, there is often no discharge, but there will be a cloudy, tacky mucus as estrogen starts to rise. When the discharge starts to increase in volume and becomes clear and stringy, ovulation is near. A return to the tacky, cloudy mucus or no discharge means that ovulation has passed.Lactational Amenorrhea Method (LAM): Some experts believe that exclusively breastfeeding protects a woman from pregnancy by curbing hormones that trigger ovulation. However, every woman's body responds differently to the hormonal influences of breastfeeding, so this is an unreliable method. [+] Sources and References     Pregnancy Guide November 2, 2006"
Use of Pesticides Increasingly Threaten Human Health,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/09/08/pesticides-threaten-human-health.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Pesticides... The chemical technology industry insists we can't grow sufficient amounts of food without them, yet mounting research1,2,3 suggests they may carry a great deal of blame for the rise in human disease.  A recent article in The Guardian4 highlights a disturbing trend of spiking rates of birth defects in Kauai, Hawaii, which many suspect is due to an increase in pesticide use on genetically engineered (GE) corn.   Rates of learning disabilities are also higher in areas with heavy pesticide use.   The video above features a clip from a much longer GMO Free News interview with State House Representative Andria Tupola (R) and Tiana Laranio, a Kauai resident.   Birth Defects and Learning Disabilities on the Rise in Kauai   In one school, which is a mere 1700 feet from Syngenta's genetically engineered (GE) corn fields, 10 percent of children need special education, compared to the state average of just over six percent.  As reported in the featured article:   ""In Kauai, chemical companies Dow, BASF, Syngenta, and DuPont spray 17 times more pesticide per acre (mostly herbicides, along with insecticides and fungicides) than on ordinary cornfields in the US mainland, according to the most detailed study5 of the sector...  Sidney Johnson, a pediatric surgeon at the Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children who oversees all children born in Hawaii with major birth defects... says he's been thinking about pesticides a lot lately.   The reason: he's noticed that the number of babies born here with their abdominal organs outside, a rare condition known as gastroschisis, has grown from three a year in the 1980s to about a dozen now...  So he's working with a medical student on a study of his hospital's records to determine whether the parents of the gastroschisis infants were living near fields that were being sprayed around the time of conception and early pregnancy.""     Poisoning Paradise   The reason for this alarmingly elevated use of pesticides on the island of Kauai is because the companies are testing GE corn's ability to resist chemicals that normally kill other plants.   One quarter of the 12,000 acres is dedicated to ""restricted use pesticides""  chemicals known for their elevated toxicity, such as chlorpyrifos, atrazine, and paraquat; the latter two of which are banned in Europe.  In 2012, 18 tons of these ""restricted use"" pesticides were applied in Kauai. Glyphosate, in the form of Roundup, is also used of course, and this broad-spectrum herbicide may also be far more toxic than anyone ever imagined.   Far from being harmless and biodegradable as Monsanto's PR department has maintained, glyphosate has now been reclassified as a ""probable carcinogen"" by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a division of the World Health Organization (WHO).  In response to the IARC's determination, some British and German retailers have started removing Roundup from its lineup of weed killers sold to the general public, and France has announced plans to restrict its sale at garden centers.6  In a recent interview, researcher Anthony Samsel, PhD also revealed that internal Monsanto documents show they actually knew, over 30 years ago, that glyphosate caused adenomas and carcinomas in rats...  Recent follow-up research7,8 by Gilles-ric Sralini also shows that long-term exposure to ultra-low amounts of Roundup may cause liver and kidney damage, tumors, and hemorrhagic bleeding.  The expression of more than 4,000 genes in the rats' liver and kidneys had changed in response to the herbicide, and since the dose used is ""environmentally relevant in terms of human, domesticated animals, and wildlife levels of exposure,"" the authors suggest Roundup may have significant health implications.   ""When the spraying is underway and the wind blows downhill from the fields to the town  a time no spraying should occur  residents complain of stinging eyes, headaches, and vomiting,"" The Guardian writes.   Unfortunately, the pesticide companies refuse to divulge exactly which chemicals are used, and in what amounts. This makes treating patients more difficult, as there's no information about what they might have been exposed to.  What's worse, these companies are also operating under a permit from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) that was grandfathered in from the days when the area was a sugar plantation. Back then, far fewer pesticides were used, but this decades-old permit still allows them to discharge chemicals into local water supplies.  A number of attempts have been made to restrict the growing of GE crops and curb the undisclosed use of pesticides on the island chain of Hawaii, but none have been completely successful as of yet.   In Maui County, a ballot initiative calling for a moratorium on all GE farming was successfully passed, despite Monsanto and its allies spending $7.2 million to defeat it.   But, the industry sued and a federal judge overturned the law saying the Maui County initiative was preempted by federal law. That and a few other rulings in favor of the chemical technology industry are still under appeal.    Pesticides Pose Greater Risk to Pollinators Than Previously Thought   In related news, a new European Food and Safety Authority (EFSA) study has concluded that neonicotinoid pesticides may actually pose a greater risk to bees than previously thought, and is calling for extending the EU's ban on neonicotinoids.   According to The Guardian:9   ""Already proscribed for seed treatments and soil applications, the Efsa analysis says that clothianidin, imidacloprid, and thiamethoxam also pose a 'high risk' to bees when sprayed on leaves.  The UK is currently facing a legal challenge to an emergency exemption it granted, allowing use of two of the substances... But far from supporting the British case, the advisory expert assessment will add to pressure for an extension of the ban to apply to fruit orchards after blooming, and crops grown in greenhouses...""   Syngenta, which manufactures thiamethoxam, has historically not garnered the same horrible reputation as Monsanto. But in this case, Syngenta showed it operates according to the same ruthless rulebook when it threatened to sue EFSA officials involved with the creation of the original risk assessment two years ago.10  Speaking of Syngenta, Monsanto's bid to buy the company has fallen through after Syngenta rejected the latest offer of $47 billion.11 One by one, pesticides are eventually found to be profoundly harmful  at least that appears to be the trend.  So to keep one step ahead, companies need to continue creating new ones, which is likely why Monsanto sought to acquire Syngenta in the first place, In addition to changing their brand name, which has been associated by many with evil incarnate, the purchase would have added mammoth holdings and power to Monsanto's GMO arsenal. With Roundup's patent expiring a few years ago, I believe it's only a matter of time before regulators will have to curb (if not ban) the use of Roundup due to its toxicity, which means Monsanto undoubtedly needs to find something to replace its best-selling flagship product.   Next-Generation Weed and Pest Killers    Disturbingly, Monsanto is reportedly working on a whole new breed of pesticides  sprays that employ RNA interference technology rather than toxic chemicals to kill insects and weeds. In a nutshell, such a product kills its target by way of silencing certain genes that are crucial to the target's survival. As reported by Mother Jones:12   ""RNAi, as it's known, is an emerging science; the two US researchers who discovered it brought home a Nobel Prize in 2006. Regalado describes the process like this:   'The cells of plants and animals carry their instructions in the form of DNA. To make a protein, the sequence of genetic letters in each gene gets copied into matching strands of RNA, which then float out of the nucleus to guide the protein-making machinery of the cell. RNA interference, or gene silencing, is a way to destroy specific RNA messages so that a particular protein is not made.'   If you can nix RNA messages that exist to generate crucial genes, you've got yourself an effective bug or weed killer...  The first obstacle is technological  the problem of 'how to get a large, electrically charged molecule like RNA to move through a plant's waxy cuticle and into its cells,' Regalado writes. That's crucial, because the technology works like this: A targeted bug... chomps on a leaf that's been sprayed by RNA solution and then, fatally, gets critical genes turned off. To make that happen, you have to get the RNA material into the leaf.""   An obvious question here is: how may this RNA material in the plant affect animals and humans that eat it? RNAi sounds reminiscent of the experimental GE wheat created two years ago, which employed a gene silencing technique to alter the wheat's carbohydrate content.   At the time, University of Canterbury Professor Jack Heinemann released results from genetic research he conducted on the wheat, which showed the gene silencing molecules created in the wheat could potentially silence human genes as well. University Professor Judy Carman agreed with Heinemann's analysis, stating that children in whom that specific enzyme does not work tend to die by the age of five.13 So, if you ask me, the health risks may reach brand new heights if this kind of gene silencing technology takes over the pesticide industry.   Pesticide Use Near Schools Raise Concerns   Pesticides pose risks in two ways. One is via contaminated foods  and GE foods in particular, as they're more heavily treated than conventional varieties. The other is via the pesticide application itself. Gardeners, farm workers, and those living near farms are at greatest risk. Concerns over pesticide application near schools, playgrounds, and churches have also been raised.  For example, the Environmental Working Group (EWG) recently released a report14 showing that Roundup is being sprayed in fields next to 12,000 churches, which might put thousands of Christians in harm's way.15   In Ventura County, the Board of Supervisors recently demanded to know why the California Department of Pesticide Regulation allowed strawberry farmers to use ""unusually high"" levels of 1,3-Dichloropropene  a known carcinogen via inhalation or ingestion  on fields surrounding the Rio Mesa high school. A Reveal News article16 discussing this case notes that the California Department of Pesticide Regulation responded to community concerns ""with statements that contradict the findings of their own scientists.""   According to the article:    ""By carving out a loophole for Dow AgroSciences and growers, the department allowed heavy amounts of the pesticide to be used near schools, homes, and businesses in Ventura County, and across the state. In all, the investigation found, more than 100 communities were put at greater risk of cancer... The department was effectively letting growers use as much 1,3-D as they wanted, despite the possible health concerns...""    Conflicts of Interest Place Citizens at Risk   The situation in Ventura County has become typical. Again and again, we see regulators bowing to the will of the chemical industry and growers who aren't wise to less toxic alternatives. The end result is an increasingly toxic food supply, and an increasingly toxic environment. How long are we going to allow the food industry to be one of the greatest sources of pollution and toxic exposure in this world? It's really madness when you stop and think about it.  It really makes one wonder just how bad the situation needs to get before money ceases to have more value than ecological and human life... When it comes to genetically modified organisms (GMOs) and pesticides, conflicts of interest seem to have had a particularly strong influence.   In February, the California-based activist group US Right to Know filed a request under Washington's freedom-of-information law (FOIA) to obtain correspondence between 40 researchers at US public universities and 36 different companies, trade groups, and PR firms. The purpose of the FOIA requests was to determine whether or not academics and researchers are coordinating their messaging with the industry, and/or receiving undisclosed remuneration for spreading positive messages about GMO's.   According to the journal Nature,17 obtained documentation included ""roughly 4,600 pages of emails and other records from Kevin Folta, a plant scientist at the University of Florida in Gainesville and a well-known advocate of GM organisms. The records... reveal his close ties to the agriculture giant Monsanto... and other biotechnology-industry interests.""    The Case of Kevin Folta  Kevin Folta is one of the scientists answering questions on the industry website GMO Answers, which is managed by the biotechnology PR firm Ketchum. Folta claimed he never accepted any honoraria for any of his pro-GMO outreach work. According to GMO Watch, a couple of months ago he even declared18 he had ""nothing to do with Monsanto."" Yet the FOIA documentation shows he received an ""unrestricted grant"" of $25,000 from Monsanto in 2014  monies he never disclosed receiving.   According to Gary Ruskin, executive director of US Right to Know:    ""I think it's important for professors who take money from industry to disclose it. And if they're not disclosing it, that's a problem. And if they say they aren't taking money, and they are, then that's a problem.""  To quell growing criticism, Folta's employer now wants the grant money Folta received to be donated to a food pantry.19 A recent article by GMO Watch20 points out how Folta is now playing the victim after playing the public as fools, and is claiming to have received ""implied threats."" But according to GMO Watch, this may be nothing more than ""a flimsy attempt to distract from the real issue  his own apparent dishonesty  while vilifying his critics..."" noting a number of non-GMO advocates and anti-GMO scientists who have received very real death threats.   ""[I]t has to be said that neither Folta playing the victim nor the reallocation of Monsanto's money does anything to address the driving force behind all the criticism,"" GMO Watch writes. ""People are angry with Folta not about the Monsanto money per se, but about Folta not being straight about it or about his wider relationship with the biotech industry. And nothing Folta has done since the news came out has done anything to repair that yawning integrity gap.""   Academics Increasingly Used as Public Relations Pawns   The now-routine ""third-party approach"" of enlisting academics and ""independent"" researchers like Folta to push an industry agenda is also discussed in a recent New York Times article,21 which includes a rather damning quote from Folta to an Monsanto executive. In response to the approval of the $25,000 grant in August last year, Folta wrote back saying: ""I am grateful for this opportunity and promise a solid return on the investment.""  That doesn't sound like a comment from an impartial party, does it? In another email22 from Folta to a Monsanto executive released by US Right to Know, Folta wrote: ""I'm glad to sign on to whatever you like, or write whatever you like.""  Moreover, while the initial Nature23 article made it seem as though Folta had ignored the pre-written answers provided for him by the biotech PR firm Ketchum, along with the questions they sent to be answered for the GMO Answers website, the New York Times claims Folta often did use the canned answers nearly verbatim, noting he now says doing so was ""a mistake,"" and ""absolutely not the right thing."" This is yet another lie Folta's been caught in, according to the latest US Right to Know update on its investigation24  lies that the New York Times did not address.   What's more, since the $25,000 Folta received was given as a SHARE contribution, it's not subject to IDC and not publicly noted. In other words, it's a way for donations to be made without having to disclose the contribution and the potential influence of the donor, while still being able to claim full transparency.    ""Corporations have poured money into universities to fund research for decades, but now, the debate over bioengineered foods has escalated into a billion-dollar food industry war,"" the New York Times writes. ""Companies like Monsanto are squaring off against major organic firms like Stonyfield Farm, the yogurt company, and both sides have aggressively recruited academic researchers, emails obtained through open records laws show.  The emails provide a rare view into the strategy and tactics of a lobbying campaign that has transformed ivory tower elites into powerful players. The use by both sides of third-party scientists, and their supposedly unbiased research, helps explain why the American public is often confused as it processes the conflicting information... There is no evidence that academic work was compromised, but the emails show how academics have shifted from researchers to actors in lobbying and corporate public relations campaigns."" [Emphasis mine]   Another Trend: Retracting Articles Unfavorable to Industry   The FOIA requests issued by US Right to Know also received support in an article25 published in PLOS Biology Community Blog, written by Paul D. Thacker and Charles Seife. Monsanto and the biotech industry at large has developed a pattern of demanding retractions of unfavorable articles, so it was no great surprise to find that Thacker and Seife's article (which argued in favor of using FOIA requests to scrutinize scientists' behavior and potentially undisclosed industry ties) was promptly removed from the PLOS website.   According to PLOS,26,27 the article ""was not consistent with at least the spirit and intent of our community guidelines."" It's become quite clear that not only is the industry trying to monopolize science  allowing only favorable research to see the light of day  they're also trying to protect the system of conflicts of interest. The end goal is to keep consumers in the dark about what's really going on. And about what's in their food. Why else would they pour tens of millions of dollars into lobbying against transparency?    Chemical, Agricultural, and Food Industries All Spend Big Bucks Lobbying for Less Transparency  According to Civil Eats,28 food and beverage companies have spent $51.6 million on a series of efforts to defeat GMO labeling laws, including lobbing for HR 1599, which would bar states from implementing their own GMO labeling laws. As of July 21 Monsanto alone had spent $2.5 million lobbying Congress.29  The food industry has also spent $54.2 million lobbying for the removal of country-of-origin labeling (COOL) requirements for beef, chicken, and pork (HR 2393).30   In a similar vein, in 2013 and 2014, agribusinesses, agricultural organizations, and trade associations spent more than $11 million lobbying for an early version of S1500,31 which eliminates the need for permits to discharge pesticides into rivers, lakes, streams, and other bodies of water regulated under the Clean Water Act. Who does that benefit? Certainly not the environment or people living near bodies of water! International trade agreements also threaten to restrict transparency about food  how it's produced, and where it comes from. In addition to hampering GMO labeling efforts in the US, provisions in both the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP) would also effectively force participating nations to eliminate country of origin from their food labels or run the risk of being sued for harming trade.  It seems the reason why these industries are spending so much money and going to such great lengths to eliminate transparency about toxic exposures and potentially harmful substances in our food supply is because they too can see that the jig is almost up. The situation is simply unsustainable. It's only a matter of time before the human lifespan begins to dwindle in response to excessive toxic exposures  people's health is already being compromised at an ever-earlier age.   These industries are really just grasping for straws right now, trying to hang on for as long as they can, until the whole system falls apart  as it must, eventually. But just because the opposition is great, that doesn't mean we quit fighting to turn the system around. On the contrary, now is the time to press on with greater resolve. I believe we can still avoid a lot of hardship and misery by standing up for what's right, and right now, that includes pressing our US Senators to reject HR 1599.

Risk Factors of Certain Diseases Linked to Birth Month,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/06/24/diseases-linked-to-birth-month.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Your birth month may have a significant impact on your risk of developing certain diseases throughout your lifetime. In a study of 1,688 different health conditions, 55 were significantly dependent on birth month.1 While 19 of these associations were previously reported in medical journals (such as asthma and short-sightedness), and 20 were for diseases with close associations to those already reported, 16 new connections were revealed  including nine different types of heart disease. Overall, those born in May had the lowest disease risk while those born in October had the highest, but there were many additional variables reported. According to the researchers:2  Hippocrates described a connection between seasonality and disease nearly 2500 years ago, for knowing the changes of the seasonshow each of them takes place, he [the clinician] will be able to know beforehand what sort of a year is going to ensue for with the seasons the digestive organs of men undergo a change.  Following in footsteps laid more than 2 millennia ago, recent studies have linked birth month with neurological, reproductive, endocrine and immune/inflammatory disorders, and overall lifespan.    What Does Your Month of Birth Say About Your Health?  Several trends stood out to the researchers, including those linking neurological, reproductive, endocrine, and immune system health with birth month. Specifically, people born in:  March and April were more likely to have heart issues, including atherosclerosis October and November were more likely to suffer from bronchitis, viral infections, and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) December were more prone to bruising September had a higher risk of vomiting January were more likely to suffer from essential hypertension  Past research has also linked birth month with various diseases. In 1983, researchers found those born from May to September, when dust mites tend to be more abundant in the home, had a 40 percent increased risk of developing asthma, complicated by dust mite allergies.3 According to the featured study, Their finding was corroborated later when it was found that sensitization to allergens during infancy increases lifetime risk of developing allergies.4 Last year, researchers also found Swedish children born in November and December had an increased risk of being diagnosed with ADHD, which they suggested might be due to their relative immaturity age-wise relative to their peers in school.5 Researchers of the featured study found a similar trend:6  We compared our ADHD smoothed proportions to odds ratios reported by a Swedish study and found a similar upward trend towards the later part of the year peaking in November. A rationale for their findings (and ours) is that relative immaturity (born later in the year) may result in increased ADHD detection.  This occurs because more immature children (i.e., younger in age) face higher demands early on in their school years making them more susceptible to ADHD diagnosis. The age cutoff for schools in Sweden is 31 December, which is the same for NYC public schools.    Birth Month Influences Your Sun Exposure and Vitamin D  Many of the associations could have their roots in sun exposure, which increases vitamin D levels. For instance, babies born in spring have a higher risk of heart issues later in life, and spring babies would have been in utero during the winter months, when sun exposure, and vitamin D levels, tend to fall. Vitamin D is very important for reducing hypertension, atherosclerotic heart disease, heart attack, and stroke, which brings the connection full circle. Further, that ADHD is more commonly diagnosed in children born in the fall and winter could also be related to vitamin D status. According to the featured study:7  the relationship between Vitamin D and ADHD and learning patterns has been established in rats and Vitamin D deficiency in early development (in utero or shortly after birth) could be related to ADHD.   In addition, past research found that those who were born in April or May, just after the darker, colder winter months, were significantly more likely to have multiple sclerosis (MS) than those born during October and November (after the summer months).8   Vitamin D may affect MS risk by altering chemicals called cytokines, which modulate your immune system and can either reduce or increase inflammation depending on their levels and proportions.  Food Allergies and Mood Also Linked to Birth Month    Similarly, US children (those living in Boston, in particular) born in fall and winter also have a higher risk of developing food allergies, which researchers again believe is due to seasonal fluctuations in sunlight and lower vitamin D levels.9 Even your mood might be affected by your birth month or, as researchers call it, your seasonal biology. Animal studies suggest mice raised in winter conditions (with less daily light exposure) may be prone to poor mood, including seasonal affective disorder, while mice raised in summer conditions had happier dispositions.10 Researcher Professor Douglas McMahon told the Daily Mail:11  Several studies show that people born in the winter months have an elevated risk of mood disorders such as seasonal depression, bipolar depression and schizophrenia  all of which are associated with disruption of normal circadian rhythms  Whether seasonal birth could impact personality and mood is speculative, but not too far-fetched. Even though this sounds a bit like astrology, it is not: its seasonal biology.    Even Time of Conception May Matter  You probably rarely think about your health in relation to your birth month, let alone the month in which you were conceived, but even this may impact your future health.  Specifically, birth defect rates tend to be highest for women who conceive in the spring and summer  a time that correlates with increased levels of pesticides in surface water.12 Researcher Paul Winchester, M.D., Indiana University School of Medicine professor of clinical pediatrics, noted:13  Elevated concentrations of pesticides and other agrochemicals in surface water during April through July coincided with significantly higher risk of birth defects in live births conceived by women whose last menstrual period began in the same months.While our study didn't prove a cause and effect link, the fact that birth defects and pesticides in surface water peak during the same four months makes us suspect that the two are related.    Your Habits and Lifestyle Matter More Than Your Birth Month  You cant do anything to change your birth month, and you certainly shouldnt worry if you were born in October, which had the highest rate of disease associations. Nor should you feel your health is guaranteed if you happened to be born in the healthiest month of May. Your lifestyle choices matter far more for your ongoing health than your birth month. As reported by Newsweek:14  The scientists behind the research have noted that other variables, such as an unhealthy diet and lack of exercise, play a far greater role in susceptibility to disease and advised that prospective parents should not worry about rearranging their reproductive calendars.    I've previously written about how your environment and lifestyle, particularly your diet, has a direct influence on your genetic expression. For example, research using identical twins have shown that diet trumps genes in terms of the level of health you achieve.   The science of epigenetics also challenges the conventional view of genetics, proving that the environment determines which traits a gene will express, and that your fate is in no way written in stone even if you have genetic predispositions or are born in a certain unhealthy month. As an example, take a look at cancer research. While a lot of research money is funneled into genetic research, virtually nothing is spent on determining the extent to which our food and environment triggers the disease.   As mentioned, your genes will express or suppress genetic data depending on the environment in which it finds itself, meaning the presence or absence of appropriate nutrients, toxins, and even your thoughts and feelings, which unleash hormones and other chemicals in your body. Research into the health of our ancient ancestors also suggests that cancer is indeed a manmade disease, in large part caused by environmental factors such as:    Pesticide- and other synthetic chemical exposures   A predominance of sugars and grains which causes the body to burn sugar rather than fat as its primary fuel  Wireless technologies, dirty electricity, and medical diagnostic radiation exposure    Pharmaceutical drugs  Obesity, stress, and poor sleeping habits  Lack of sunshine exposure and use of sunscreens   Were this to be officially acknowledged to be at the heart of our cancer epidemic, people would likely demand a complete overhaul of most industries that provide us with everything from food and clothes to personal care products, furnishings and more. No one really wants to take that bull by the horn, and our flawed system allows these industries to pad the pockets of politicians and regulators who make sure they're protected from invasive scrutiny. And, this isnt only relevant to cancer. Many other chronic diseases, from heart disease and diabetes to obesity and even likely Alzheimers disease, stem from poor diet, toxic exposures, inactivity, and other lifestyle factors.  How to Take Control of Your Health   Ideally you're already leading a healthy lifestyle, eating right, exercising, maintaining healthy vitamin D levels and managing stress, but if you're not, it's never too late to start. Each tissue only uses about 10 percent to 20 percent of its gene complement, and you want to be sure that those genes are the most advantageous ones possible for your health. You can begin to ""remind"" your cells to express in a healthful way, long before you manifest a disease, by encouraging your genes to express positive, disease-fighting behaviors by leading a healthy lifestyle.   No matter what your birth month or current state of health, I suggest you take matter into your own hands, educate yourself about health, and do that which is within your own powerwhich is a lot, by the way. Keep in mind that diet is only part of the equation. You can also turn your genes on and off with your emotions, and exercise has a direct impact on DNA as well.

10 Ways to Address Your Root Causes of Infertility Naturally,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/10/29/10-ways-to-address-your-root-causes-of-infertility--naturally.aspx,
Vitamin D Has Been Shown to Dramatically Improve Fertility,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/02/16/the-vitamin-that-has-been-shown-to-dramatically-improve-infertility.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Did you know that in northern countries, which have dark, cold winters, couples are less likely to conceive during the winter, whereas conception rates peak in the summer?  There are a number of reasons why this association exists, but new research highlights vitamin D as one of the most important variable. Vitamin D, a steroid hormone that influences virtually every cell in your body and has been positively linked to health conditions ranging from cancer to heart disease, may significantly boost fertility in both men and women.  If Youre Struggling With Infertility, Get Your Vitamin D Levels Checked  Vitamin D is so crucial to health that I urge everyone to make sure their levels are optimized, but if youve been dealing with infertility, this is especially important.  A new report has shown that exposure to sunlight boosts fertility in both men and women by increasing their levels of vitamin D, a benefit that appears to work on multiple levels. As the researchers reported in the European Journal of Endocrinology:  Among women, vitamin D appears to impact in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common female endocrine disorder, as well as boost levels of progesterone and estrogen, which regulate menstrual cycles and improve the likelihood of successful conception  In men, vitamin D is essential for the healthy development of the nucleus of the sperm cell, and helps maintain semen quality and sperm count. Vitamin D also increases levels of testosterone, which may boost libido   The researchers state:  Given the high prevalence of infertility as well as vitamin D insufficiency in otherwise healthy young women and men and the possible role of vitamin D in human reproduction, research might lead to new therapeutic approaches such as vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of female and male reproductive disorders.  Low Vitamin D Levels Previously Linked to Infertility  This is not the first time the sunshine vitamin has been linked to infertility. In 2008, Australian fertility specialist Dr. Anne Clark found almost one-third of the 800 infertile men included in her study had lower than normal levels of vitamin D, (bear in mind here that ""normal"" does not equal ""optimal"" -- so by optimal standards, the rate of vitamin D deficiency was likely far higher than one-third) stating that:1   ""Vitamin D and folate deficiency are known to be associated with infertility in women, but the outcomes of the screening among men in our study group came as a complete surprise. Men in the study group who agreed to make lifestyle changes and take dietary supplements had surprisingly good fertility outcomes.""  In fact, of the 100 men who agreed to make and maintain certain lifestyle changes (quitting smoking, minimizing intake of caffeine and alcohol, weight reduction, along with a course of vitamins and antioxidants) for three months prior to fertility treatment, 11 of them went on to achieve pregnancy naturally, without IVF treatment. Previous studies, such as one published in The Journal of Nutrition, also found that although vitamin-D-deficient female rats were capable of reproduction, it reduced fertility by an astounding 75 percent, diminished litter sizes by 30 percent, and impaired neonatal growth.2 Interestingly, another study published in November 2009 confirmed that human sperm does in fact have a vitamin D receptor.3 Analysis indicated that vitamin D is produced locally in the sperm, which suggests that vitamin D may be involved in the signaling between cells in the reproductive system. According to the authors, the study revealed ""an unexpected significance of this hormone [vitamin D] in the acquisition of fertilizing ability,"" and the results imply that vitamin D is involved in a variety of sperm signaling pathways.  What Else Might be Impacting Your Fertility?  An estimated 1 in 6 American couples struggle with getting pregnant each year, and there's compelling evidence that lifestyle, diet and environmental exposures are largely to blame. Not only are you exposed to hundreds (if not thousands) of toxins each and every day, but some of the most commonly prescribed drugs, poor diet, and common vitamin deficiencies have also been linked to reduced fertility, just to name a few.  As Iva Keene, author of the Natural Fertility Prescription, stated:  Conventional IVF and other assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments dont address root causes of infertility. These root causes include: nutritional deficiencies, toxin exposure, stress, food intolerances, allergies and immune deficiencies. These subtle but critical factors interact synergistically to impact the quality of your eggs and sperm, affecting your ability to conceive and the health of your embryo.  during the generation and maturation of gamete cells -- sperm and ovum -- that form an embryo [a period of 120 days], everything that you and your partner ingest, inhale or are exposed to will influence the health of your eggs and sperm for better or worse, and the ultimate quality of the genetic building blocks you pass onto your child. This is why its crucial to follow a good preconception plan for a minimum of 4 months before conception. A baby is a 50-50 product of his or her parents -- therefore optimizing the quality of eggs and sperm is of paramount importance.  You can find 10 tips that may help resolve infertility naturally in her past article, but here are a few initial strategies to consider:  Genetically modified food (GM), especially corn and soy, contain significant concentrations of the herbicide glyphosate (the active ingredient in Roundup), which has been linked to infertility in a number of studies.  Avoid chemicals as much as possible. Bisphenol-A (BPA), phthalates, fluoride (in drinking water), MSG, and many, many others have shown negative impacts on your reproductive health.  Consume a healthy diet, rich in healthy fats and antioxidants, and low in sugar and grains. Insulin resistance is an underlying factor responsible for most chronic disease, and it should come as no surprise that it plays a role in fertility as well. The treatment strategy is to reduce or eliminate grains along with sugars, especially fructose.  Identify potential gluten intolerance. Celiac disease (gluten intolerance) has been linked to fertility problems in both sexes. In men, it's associated with abnormal sperm, such as lower sperm numbers, altered shape, and reduced function. Men with untreated celiac disease may also have lower testosterone levels.  Be aware of electromagnetic fields, as research suggests cell phones may impact sperm quality as well. One study found men who talked on a cell phone for more than four hours a day had the lowest average sperm counts (50 million per milliliter) and the least healthy sperm.4    Are You Ready to Optimize Your Vitamin D Levels?  This is an imperative step for anyone planning a pregnancy, not only for increasing the rate of conception but also for the benefits it offers during pregnancy. Vitamin D deficiency is currently at epidemic proportions in the United States and many other regions around the world, largely because people do not spend enough time in the sun to facilitate this important process of vitamin D production. So the first step to ensuring you are receiving all the benefits of vitamin D is to find out what your levels are using a 25(OH)D test, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. There are two vitamin D tests -- 1,25(OH)D and 25(OH)D -- but 25(OH)D is the better marker of overall D status. It is this marker that is most strongly associated with overall health, and it is the one you should ask your physician for.. The point of vitamin D testing is, of course, to be sure you are maintaining a therapeutic level of vitamin D in your blood. A few years back, the recommended level was between 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml), but more recently the optimal vitamin D level has been raised to 50-70 ng/ml.  To get your levels into the healthy range, sun exposure is the BEST way to optimize your vitamin D levels; exposing a large amount of your skin until it turns the lightest shade of pink, as near to solar noon as possible, is typically necessary to achieve adequate vitamin D production. If sun exposure is not an option, a safe tanning bed (with electronic ballasts rather than magnetic ballasts, to avoid unnecessary exposure to EMF fields) can be used.  As a last resort, a vitamin D3 supplement can be taken orally, but research suggests the average adult needs to take 8,000 IU's of vitamin D per day in order to elevate their levels above 40 ng/ml, which is the absolute minimum for disease prevention. For more details, be sure to read How to Get Your Vitamin D Within Healthy Ranges. Infertility can be a challenging condition with multiple contributing factors, but you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by optimizing your vitamin D levels. It is free if you do it via sun exposure, and inexpensive if you use a safe tanning bed or vitamin D3 supplement. Its a simple step that can have a profound impact on your health, even if trying to conceive naturally is not your primary goal.

What Pheromones Reveal About Your Love Life,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/02/28/pheromones.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Insects, fish, and non-human mammals all have pheromones, which are chemical signals that influence the behavior or physiology of other members of the same species. Pheromones may, for instance, divulge an animals age, gender, and emotional state, along with their social and reproductive status. Whether or not humans release pheromones, and what role they play considering humans have multiple other systems to acquire information, is a subject of debate and considerable research.  While the underpinnings of human pheromones are still being discovered, its clear that humans do communicate on a chemical level and, according to The Monell Chemical Senses Center, Its much more than we thought.1  Pheromones Likely Influence Sexual Attraction  If youve ever found yourself inexplicably attracted to a stranger youve just met, it could very well be their chemical signals that you find irresistible. Humans tend to be attracted to those with a dissimilar genetic make-up to themselves, which is signaled by subtle odors (though you probably dont consciously recognize).  This ensures genetic diversity for the species. For instance, its thought that each of us has a unique signature smell due to a collection of proteins called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHCs help to regulate your immune system, and theres evidence that they also play a role in your selection of a mate.  Ideally, you would select a partner with MHCs quite different from your own, as this would diversify your childs immune system, making them better equipped to fight off pathogens. In one study, women sniffed shirts worn by men and selected those which theyd most like to socialize with. The women tended to choose men with dissimilar MHC except when they were taking birth control pills.  When a woman is on the Pill, her odor preferences change. The Pill essentially mimics pregnancy, and when a woman is pregnant, she tends to prefer the scent of men with similar MHC as her ownperhaps as a biological cue to now seek out and bond with supportive family members as opposed to potential mates.  What this means is that when you're taking a hormonal contraceptive, you interfere with your biology and risk producing a hormonal imbalance that might make you more attracted to men with similar chemical makeup.  If you were on the pill when you met your mate, you might, therefore, feel less attracted to him when you stop taking it. The studys lead author noted:2  Choosing a non-hormonal barrier method of contraception for a few months before getting married might be one way for a woman to check or reassure herself that shes still attracted to her partner.   Scientific Proof of Chemical Attraction  There are many fascinating studies that show there really can be an unconscious chemistry between two people. Often, this appears related to estrus, or the time in a womens menstrual cycle when shes most fertile and able to conceive.  One study involved professional lap dancers in a gentlemens club. The women earned the most tips just prior to ovulation, the most fertile period, and the least tips during menstruation.3 Women taking birth control pills, however, did not show a significant difference in tips throughout their cycle. A separate study involved men smelling t-shirts worn by women who were about to ovulate. The men had higher testosterone levels than when they smelled t-shirts from women not about to ovulate or those with a control scent. According to the study:4  Hence, olfactory cues signaling women's levels of reproductive fertility were associated with specific endocrinological responses in men--responses that have been linked to sexual behavior and the initiation of romantic courtship.  There are actually a growing number of studies showing that scent communication may play a central role in mating not just in non-human mammals but in humans as well. For instance, men may perceive women's high-fertility body scents (collected near ovulation) as more attractive than their low-fertility body scents.5  A Womans Fertility Status May Influence a Mans Behavior  Research even shows that subtle signs of womens fertility influences mens mating cognition and behavior and facilitates psychological and behavioral processes associated with the pursuit of a sexual partner. According to one series of studies:6  In Study 1, men exposed to the scent of a woman near peak levels of fertility displayed increased accessibility to sexual concepts. Study 2 demonstrated that, among men who reported being sensitive to odors, scent cues of fertility triggered heightened perceptions of women's sexual arousal.  Study 3 revealed that, in a face-to-face interaction, high levels of female fertility were associated with a greater tendency for men to make risky decisions and to behaviorally mimic a female partner. Hence, subtle cues of fertility led to a cascade of mating-related processes-from lower order cognition to overt behavior-that reflected heightened mating motivation. The opposite may also hold true, in that women who smelled mens sweat reported feeling less tense and more relaxed than women who smelled a placebo. Researchers also detected a shift in luteinizing hormone, which typically surge just prior to ovulation (but also peaks hundreds of times during the menstrual cycle).7   6 Weird Facts About Kissing  While were on the topic of attraction, you may be surprised to learn that that first kiss (or the many after) may serve a very important purpose. Actually, it may serve multiple purposes. As reported in TIME:8 1. Kissing May Build Your Immunity  A 10-second kiss may transfer 80 million germs from one mouth to another. As you pass these bugs around, your body can build up immunity to them. One such bug is cytomegalovirus, which lurks in saliva. It normally causes no problems, but it can be extremely dangerous if caught while pregnant and can kill unborn babies or cause birth defects. Research suggests that kissing the same person for about six months may provide optimum protection and allow women time to build up immunity against cytomegalovirus. Writing in the journal Medical Hypotheses, researcher Dr. Colin Hendrie from the University of Leeds said:9  Female inoculation with a specific male's cytomegalovirus is most efficiently achieved through mouth-to-mouth contact and saliva exchange, particularly where the flow of saliva is from the male to the typically shorter female.   2. Kissing Is Another Way to Assess Your Potential Mate  Women rate kissing differently at different points in their menstrual cycle. When theyre close to ovulation, romantic kissing is rated as more important.10  3. It May Boost Libido  French kissing is enjoyed by both men and women in long-term relationships, but in short-term relationships its the men who tend to prefer it. According to Laura Berman, PhD, assistant clinical professor of ob-gyn and psychiatry at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University: One theory is that their saliva transfers testosterone to the woman, which in turn increases her sexual desire.  4. Boost Your Mood  Kissing triggers the release of feel-good chemicals like endorphins while lowering levels of the stress hormone cortisol.  5. Strengthen Your Relationship  People who report frequent kissing have greater levels of sexual satisfaction in their relationship. Men who kiss frequently also report feeling three times happier in their relationship than men who do not.  6. The Longest Kiss  The longest kiss award goes to Ekkachai Tiranarat and Laksana Tiranarat, who kissed for 58 hours, 35 minutes, and 58 seconds in 2013!   Beyond Romance: Chemical Signals May Influence Mood, Social Support and More   Chemical signals arent only reserved for attracting a mate. They influence a complex array of biological processes and human relationships. For instance:  Women who sniffed fear-induced sweat became more mentally alert and intelligent, according to a study in Chemical Senses.11 According to researchers, Humans distinguish between fear and other emotional chemosignals based on olfactory cues. Women who sniffed the scent of 2-day-old babies had increased activity in the reward-related areas of their brain.12 Exposure to other womens pheromones may cause womens menstrual cycles to speed up or slow down.13 Odors collected from pads in the underarm and breast area of breastfeeding women changed menstrual cycle length and sexual motivation in other women.14 Chemical communication may convey social support, for instance among a support group for breastfeeding women.15  So while it seems clear that chemical signals, including pheromones, play a role in sexual attraction and finding a mate, they likely influence other key relationships as well, such as those between you and your child and, possibly, even close friends. These signals may help you avoid potentially threatening situations and may one day even be harnessed to help diagnose diseases (some of which also emit a unique odor production). So you might want to think twice about covering up your own natural scent with artificial perfumes. As neuroscientist Charles Wysocki observed:16  With every little piece ofinformation we gain, we scrape away a little bit of blackness on the window. As wepeek through a little more and begin to see thathumans have the potential to communicatewith chemical signals, were finding thathuman behavior and physiology respond much more to chemical communication than we originally believed.

Vitamin D May Help Ease Menstrual Cramps,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/03/14/can-vitamin-d3-ease-menstrual-cramps.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola At least half of reproductive-age women suffer from painful menstrual cramps that begin shortly before the start of menstrual flow and continue for several days.  For some the pain is a mild annoyance, but for others it can be so severe that it interferes with daily activities. Severe menstrual cramps are actually among the most common reasons for missed work and school days among young women. For treatment, many women rely on over-the-counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen for pain relief, and conventional physicians may even prescribe birth control pills, which prevent ovulation and reduce the severity of cramps. Both of these ""solutions"" carry significant risks of side effects while doing nothing to treat the underlying reasons why menstrual cramps occur. Now researchers have uncovered another option that might ease menstrual cramp pain naturally via the ""sunshine vitamin,"" or vitamin D. Vitamin D Might Relieve Menstrual Cramp Pain During menstruation, your uterus contracts to expel its lining, a process that's triggered by hormone-like substances called prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are associated with both pain and inflammation, and higher levels of these substances are linked to more severe menstrual cramps. Vitamin D not only helps to decrease the production of prostaglandins, it also helps decrease the production of cytokines, which promote inflammation in your body.  In fact, researchers recently revealed that women with relatively low vitamin D levels (less than 45 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL)) who took a 300,000 IU mega-dose of vitamin D3 had a significant reduction in menstrual cramp pain. Two months after taking the vitamin D, the women rated their pain more than 2 points lower on a scale of 1-10, and all had stopped using painkillers. On the other hand, those who had taken a placebo reported no reduction in pain, and 40 percent were still taking pain medications. These are impressive results, however I would caution you against taking this massive dose of vitamin D, especially without medical supervision, as it is possible to overdose on vitamin D when taken in supplement form especially when your vitamin A (not beta carotene) and vitamin K2 are not properly balanced. Very high doses of vitamin D3 supplements may lead to hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) over time. This can result in deposits of calcium in your heart, lungs or kidneys, and the damage can be permanent if your vitamin D levels remain elevated for too long. The ideal way to optimize your vitamin D levels is through safe sun exposure, as this carries virtually no risk of overdosing on vitamin D.  Regular, Consistent Dosing is Best to Optimize Your Vitamin D Vitamin D deficiency is currently at epidemic proportions in the United States and many other regions around the world, largely because people do not spend enough time in the sun to facilitate this important process of vitamin D production. This is linked to a number of serious health conditions including cancer and heart disease, not to mention that researchers in the above study found that the lower a woman's level of vitamin D, the more menstrual cramp pain she experienced. So the first step to ensuring you are receiving all the benefits of vitamin D is to find out what your levels are using a 25(OH)D test, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. There are two vitamin D tests -- 1,25(OH)D and 25(OH)D -- but 25(OH)D is the better marker of overall D status. It is this marker that is most strongly associated with overall health, and it is the one you should ask your physician for. The point of vitamin D testing is, of course, to be sure you are maintaining a therapeutic level of vitamin D in your blood. A few years back, the recommended level was between 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml), but more recently the optimal vitamin D level has been raised to at least 50 ng/ml. Sun exposure is the BEST way to optimize your vitamin D levels; exposing a large amount of your skin until it turns the lightest shade of pink, as near to solar noon as possible, is typically necessary to achieve adequate vitamin D production. If sun exposure is not an option, a safe tanning bed (with electronic ballasts rather than magnetic ballasts, to avoid unnecessary exposure to EMF fields) can be used. As a last resort, a vitamin D3 supplement can be taken orally, but research suggests the average adult needs to take 8,000 IU's of vitamin D per day in order to elevate their levels above 40 ng/ml, which is the absolute minimum for disease prevention. The dosage that is right for you will be determined, ultimately, by how much is needed to keep your levels in the therapeutic range above. For more details, be sure to read How to Get Your Vitamin D Within Healthy Ranges. What's Wrong with Conventional Treatments for Menstrual Cramps? If you visit a conventional physician complaining of menstrual cramps, you're likely to leave the office with a prescription for one of two medications: an NSAID or an oral contraceptive. Aside from the fact that these only cover up your symptoms, and do nothing to heal the problem, they carry significant risks. These are made even worse since most women with menstrual cramps seek long-term relief, and may take the drugs for many months or even years. NSAIDs NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are linked to serious gastrointestinal risks, like bleeding of the digestive tract, increased blood pressure and kidney problems. This applies not only to prescription medications like Celebrex but also over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, Advil and Motrin. NSAIDs are also notoriously bad for your heart; a study by researchers at The University of Bern in Switzerland revealed that NSAIDs lead to a two to fourfold increase in the risk of heart attacks, stroke or cardiovascular death, noting that it would only take 25-50 patients being treated with NSAIDs for one year to lead to an additional heart attack or stroke.1 Birth Control Pills Hormonal birth control methods like ""the pill"" contain synthetic progesterone and synthetic estrogen -- something that is clearly not advantageous if you want to maintain optimal health. These contraceptives contain the same synthetic hormones as those used in hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which has well-documented risks, including an increased risk of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, and breast cancer.  In fact, studies have found that HRT increases post-menopausal women's breast cancer risk by at least one percent per year, and HRT with progestin increases your risk by eight percent per year, potentially going as high as 30 percent after just four years of use! Furthermore, using birth control pills to relieve menstrual cramps is counterproductive, because you may end up simply exchanging them for another health condition. Birth control pills have been linked to an increased risk of:     Cancer: Women who take birth control pills increase their risk of cervical and breast cancers, and possibly liver cancer as well.  Thinner bones: Women who take birth control pills have lower bone mineral density (BMD) than women who have never used oral contraceptives.  Heart disease: Long-term use of birth control pills may increase plaque artery buildups in your body that may raise your risk of heart disease.    Fatal blood clots: All birth control pills increase your risk of blood clots and subsequent stroke. And if your prescription contains the synthetic hormone desogestrel, your risk of fatal blood clots nearly doubles!  Impaired muscle gains: A recent study found that oral contraceptive use impairs muscle gains from resistance exercise training in women.  Long-term sexual dysfunction: The Pill may interfere with a protein that keeps testosterone unavailable, leading to long-term sexual dysfunction including decreased desire and arousal.    Migraines  Weight gain and mood changes  Yeast overgrowth and infection    More Natural Strategies to Ease Menstrual Cramps If painful menstrual cramps are interfering with your quality of life, there are a number of safe, natural strategies to consider, in addition to optimizing your vitamin D levels.   Evening Primrose Oil: This contains the essential fatty acid gamma linolenic acid (GLA), which is useful for treating pain. It is also helpful to restore abnormal hormone physiology, which can contribute to PMS symptoms.   DIM (diindolylmethane): DIM is a natural phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and Brussels sprouts. It has unique properties that allow it to modify the metabolism of estrogen, promoting optimal estrogen balance and supporting healthy progesterone and testosterone production. The severity of PMS symptoms in women has been linked to elevated estrogen, with symptoms becoming more severe as estrogen rises.2 DIM exerts a balancing effect on hormones and may benefit conditions like PMS, which are associated with estrogen-progesterone imbalance.   Chinese Herbs: Chinese herbal medicine has been used to treat menstrual pain for hundreds of years, and one study found certain Chinese herbs were more effective than NSAIDs, oral contraceptive pills, acupuncture, heat compressions, placebos, or no treatment at all in relieving menstrual cramp pain.3 Herbs in the study included:    Chinese angelica root   Szechuan lovage root   Red peony root, white peony root   Chinese motherwort   Cinnamon bark    Acupuncture: A review of 27 studies found that acupuncture may alleviate menstrual cramps better than drugs or herbal medicine by stimulating the production of endorphins and serotonin in your central nervous system.4   Dietary changes: Dietary changes can be very useful to relieve cramping and other PMS symptoms. You can try:    Avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated drinks    Reducing your sugar intake    Avoiding smoked cheeses, meats, and fish (as they can increase your fluid retention)    Making sure you're getting enough nutrients in your diet, specifically vitamin B6, manganese, vitamins A and E, calcium, magnesium, animal-based omega-3 fats and tryptophan     Exercise: This is another useful tool that helps to relieve menstrual cramps, perhaps because it raises your levels of endorphins, which are chemicals in your brain that are associated with pain relief.    Heat: Using a hot water bottle on your lower abdomen or soaking in a warm bath may provide temporary relief of menstrual pain.

This Hormone Makes Counting Calories Irrelevant,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/06/20/this-hormone-makes-counting-calories-irrelevant.aspx,"By Ron Rosedale, M.D.  It is amazing how the little twists and turns of researchers can have such a profound impact on what we generally come to realize as scientific truth. Let me share a recent fascinating example of how this impacted one of the most powerful hormones in your body. The Ob mouse is a strain of mouse that has a genetic mutation that makes it obese and unhealthy. It has been used for many years as a model of obesity to do research on, though the reason that it was obese had eluded scientists.  This changed when, in 1994, Jeffrey Friedman discovered that this mouse lacked a previously unknown hormone called leptin, and when it was injected with leptin it became thin, vibrant, and very healthy within weeks. This made headlines around the world, ""the cure for obesity found"" and pharmaceutical companies started tripping over themselves with trillion dollar signs in their eyes to be the first to genetically manufacture leptin on a large-scale.  This did not last long. When people were tested for leptin, it was found that, unlike the Ob mouse, they did not lack leptin; on the contrary almost all overweight and obese people have excess leptin.  These people were ""leptin resistant"" and giving extra leptin did little good.  The financial disappointment was extreme and scientists working for pharmaceutical companies said that leptin wasn't important anymore since they could not find a drug to control it, and therefore the industry couldn't make money on it. To make big money in medicine one needs a patent and this generally means remedies which are not commonly or easily available -- that are not natural.  This illustrates two extremely unfortunate principles in modern medicine; only those therapies that will make lots of money (generally for the pharmaceutical industry or hospitals), ever get pursued and then taught to physicians (since most of medical education after medical school takes place by drug reps), and these therapies, almost by definition, will be unnatural.  This inhibition of extremely important knowledge is not only unfortunate, it is deadly, and is exemplified by how few people, including doctors, know anything about leptin, though I would consider it to be the most important chemical in your body that will determine your health and lifespan.  Two Hormones that are Vital for Optimal Health  Each and every one of us is a combination of lives within lives. We are made up of trillions of individual living cells that each must maintain itself. Even more significantly, the cells must communicate and interact with each other to form a republic of cells that we call our individual self.  Our health and life depends on how accurately instructions are conveyed to our cells so that they can act in harmony. It is the communication among the individual cells that will determine our health and our life.  The communication takes place by hormones. Arguably therefore, the most important molecules in your body that ultimately will decide your health and life are hormones.  Many would say that genes and chromosomes are the most important molecules, however once born your genes pretty much just sit there; hormones tell them what to do. Certainly, the most important message that our cells receive is how and what to do with energy,and therefore life cannot take place without that.  The two most important hormones that deliver messages about energy and metabolism are insulin and leptin. Metabolism can roughly be defined as the chemistry that turns food into life, and therefore insulin and leptin are critical to health and disease. Both insulin and leptin work together to control the quality of your metabolism (and, to a significant extent, the rate of metabolism).  Insulin works mostly at the individual cell level, telling the vast majority of cells whether to burn or store fat or sugar and whether to utilize that energy for maintenance and repair or reproduction. This is extremely important as we shall see, for on an individual cell level turning on maintenance and repair equates to increased longevity, and turning up cellular reproduction can increase your risk of cancer. Leptin, on the other hand, controls the energy storage and utilization of the entire republic of cells allowing the body to communicate with the brain about how much energy (fat) the republic has stored, and whether it needs more, or should burn some off, and whether it is an advantageous time nutritionally-speaking for the republic --you-- to reproduce or not.  What Exactly is Leptin?  Leptin is a very powerful and influential hormone produced by fat cells that has totally changed the way that science (real science, outside of medicine) looks at fat, nutrition, and metabolism in general.  Prior to leptin's discovery, fat was viewed as strictly an ugly energy storage depot that most everyone was trying to get rid of. After it was discovered that fat produced the hormone leptin (and subsequently it was discovered that fat produced other very significant hormones), fat became an endocrine organ like the ovaries, pancreas and pituitary, influencing the rest of the body and, in particular, the brain.  Leptin, as far as science currently knows, is the most powerful regulator that tells your brain what to do about life's two main biological goals: eating and reproduction. Your fat, by way of leptin, tells your brain whether you should be hungry, eat and make more fat, whether you should reproduce and make babies, or (partly by controlling insulin) whether to ""hunker down"" and work overtime to maintain and repair yourself.  I believe I could now make a very convincing and scientifically accurate statement that that rather than your brain being in control of the rest of your body, your brain is, in fact, subservient to your fat -- and leptin. In short, leptin is the way that your fat stores speak to your brain to let your brain know how much energy is available and, very importantly, what to do with it. Therefore, leptin may be ""on top of the food chain"" in metabolic importance and relevance to disease.  How Leptin Regulates Your Weight  It has been known for many years that fat stores are highly regulated. It appeared that when one tried to lose weight the body would try to gain it back. This commonly results in ""yo-yo"" dieting and in scientific circles one talks about the ""set point"" of weight. It has long been theorized that there must be a hormone that determines this.  Science points now to leptin as being that hormone. In our ancestral history, it was advantageous to store some fat to call upon during times of famine. However, it was equally disadvantageous to be too fat. For most of our evolutionary history, it was necessary to run, to obtain prey and perhaps most importantly, to avoid being prey. If a lion was chasing a group of people it would most likely catch and eliminate from the gene pool the slowest runner and the one who could not make it up the tree -- the fattest one. Thus, fat storage had to be highly regulated and this is done, as is any regulation, through hormones, the most significant being leptin.  If a person is getting too fat, the extra fat produces more leptin which is supposed to tell the brain that there is too much fat stored, more should not be stored, and the excess should be burned.  Signals are therefore sent to an area of the brain in the hypothalamus (the arcuate nucleus) to stop being hungry, to stop eating, to stop storing fat and to start burning some extra fat off.  Controlling hunger is a major (though not the only) way that leptin controls energy storage. Hunger is a very powerful, ancient, and deep-seated drive that, if stimulated long enough, will make you eat and store more energy. Asking somebody to not eat, to voluntarily restrict calories even though they are hungry, is asking the near impossible. The only way to eat less in the long-term is to not be hungry, and the only way to do this is to control the hormones that regulate hunger, the primary one being leptin.  How Leptin Resistance Leads to Disease  More recently, it has been found that leptin not only changes brain chemistry, but can also ""rewire"" the very important areas of the brain that control hunger and metabolism. I'm not aware of any other chemical in the body that has been shown to accomplish this ""mind bending"" event. This has really caught the attention of the scientific community. Further studies have now shown that leptin, or more correctly the inability of the body to properly hear leptins signals, in other words leptin resistance, plays significant if not primary roles in heart disease, obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases, reproductive disorders, and perhaps the rate of aging itself.  It helps to control the brain areas that regulate thyroid levels and the sympathetic nervous system which also has huge impacts on blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and aging. Leptin's stimulatory effect on the sympathetic nervous system also helps determine the adrenal stress response including cortisol levels.  Leptin May Be Even More Critical Than Insulin  The importance of insulin in health and disease is becoming well-known. Aside from its obvious role in diabetes, it plays a very significant role in hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.  I was one of the first to speak publicly to doctors about insulins critical role in health well over a decade ago (see the transcribed talk Insulin and its Metabolic Effects) and I am even more convinced now.  However leptin may even supersede insulin in importance, for new research is revealing that in the long run glucose and therefore insulin levels may be largely determined by leptin. It had been previously believed that the insulin sensitivity of muscle and fat tissues were the most important factor in determining whether one would become diabetic or not. Elegant new studies are showing that the brain and liver are most important in regulating a persons blood sugar levels especially in type 2 or insulin resistant diabetes.  It should be noted again that leptin plays a vital role in regulating your brains hypothalamic activity which in turn regulates much of a persons ""autonomic"" functions; those functions that you don't necessarily think about but which determines much of your life (and health) such as body temperature, heart rate, hunger, the stress response, fat burning or storage, reproductive behavior, and newly discovered roles in bone growth and blood sugar levels.  Another very recent study reveals leptin's importance in directly regulating how much sugar that the liver manufactures via gluconeogenesis. Many chronic diseases are now linked to excess inflammation such as heart disease and diabetes. High leptin levels are very pro-inflammatory, and leptin also helps to mediate the manufacture of other very potent inflammatory chemicals from fat cells that also play a significant role in the progression of heart disease and diabetes. It has long been known that obesity greatly increased risk for many chronic diseases including heart disease and diabetes, but no one really knew why.   Leptin appears to be the missing link.  Could Leptin Also Affect How Fast You Age?  Leptin will not only determine how much fat you have, but also where that fat is put. When you are leptin resistant you put that fat mostly in your belly, your viscera, causing the so-called ""apple shape"" that is linked to much disease. Some of that fat permeates the liver, impeding the liver's ability to listen to insulin, and further hastening diabetes.   Leptin plays a far more important role in your health than, for instance, cholesterol, yet how many doctors measure leptin levels in their patients, know their own level, even know that it can be easily measured, or even what it would mean? Leptin appears to play a significant role in obesity, heart disease, osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. These are the so-called ""chronic diseases of aging"".  Could it perhaps affect the rate of aging itself?   The Biology of Aging  Scientists who study the biology of aging are beginning to look at that question. There are two endeavors, two drives that life has been programmed, since its inception, to succeed at and to succumb to. These are to eat and to reproduce.  If every one of our ancestors had not succeeded in eating and reproducing we would not be here, and this paper would be moot. All of your morphological characteristics from your hair to your toenails are designed to help you succeed at those two activities. That is what nature wants us to do. Nature's purpose is not necessarily to have you live a long and healthy life, but to perpetuate the instructions, the genes that tell how to perpetuate life.  Even so-called ""paleolithic"" diets, though undoubtedly far better than what is generally eaten today, were not necessarily designed by nature to help us live a long and healthy life but, at best, to maximize reproduction. Nature appears to not care much about what happens to us after we have had a sufficient chance to reproduce. That is why we die.  But there are clues as to how to live a long and healthy life. And that brings us once again to fat--and leptin. It takes energy to make babies; lots of it. Energy was and always will be a coveted commodity. Nature, and evolution, hates wasting it. It makes no sense to try and make babies when it appears that there's not enough energy available to successfully accomplish that goal.  Instead, it seems that virtually all living forms can ""switch gears"" and direct energy away from reproduction and towards mechanism that will allow it to ""hunker down"" for the long haul and thus be able to reproduce at a future more nutritionally opportune time. In other words nature will then let you live longer to accomplish its primary directive of reproduction.  It does this by up regulating maintenance and repair genes that increase production of intracellular antioxidant systems, heat shock proteins (that help maintain protein shape), and DNA repair enzymes. This is what happens when you restrict calories (without starvation) in animals, and that has been shown convincingly for 70 years to greatly extend the life span of many dozens of species. Thus, there is a powerful link between reproduction, energy stores, and longevity.  Genetic studies in simple organisms have shown that that link is at least partially mediated by insulin (which in simple organisms also functions as a growth hormone), and that when insulin signals are kept low, indicating scarce energy availability, maximal lifespan can be extended--- a lot; several hundred percent in worms and flies.  Glucose is an ancient fuel used even before there was oxygen in the atmosphere, for life can burn glucose without oxygen; it is an anaerobic fuel. The use of fat as fuel came later, after life in the form of plants soaked the earth in oxygen, for you cannot burn fat without oxygen.  The primary source of energy stores in people by far is fat, as many unfortunately are all too aware of. The primary signal that indicates how much fat is stored is leptin, and it is also leptin that allows for reproduction, or not.  It has long been known that women with very little body fat, such as marathon runners, stop ovulating. There is not enough leptin being produced to permit it. Paradoxically, the first pharmaceutical use of leptin was recently approved to give to skinny women to allow them to reproduce.   Leptins Role in Improving Your Metabolism  Leptin also is instrumental in regulating body temperature, partly by controlling the rate of metabolism via its regulation of the thyroid.   Metabolic rate and temperature has long been connected with longevity. Almost all mechanisms that extend lifespan in many different organisms result in lower temperature. Flowers are refrigerated at the florist to extend their lifespan. Restricting calories in animals also results in lower temperature, reduced thyroid levels, and longer life.   It should be noted that reduced thyroid levels in this case are not synonymous with hypothyroidism. Here, the body is choosing to lower thyroid hormones because the increased efficiency of energy use and hormonal signaling (including perhaps thyroid) is allowing this to happen. Anything will dissolve faster in hot water than cold water. Extra heat will dissolve, disrupt and disorganize. This is not what I try to do to make someone healthy. It is commonly advised to ""increase metabolism"" and increase ""thermogenesis"" for health and weight loss.  Yet how many of you would put a brand of gasoline in your car that advertised that it would make your engine run hotter? What would that do to the life of your car? It is not an increase in metabolism that I am after; it is improved metabolic quality.  That will be determined at the quality of your leptin signaling.  If it is poor, if you are insulin and leptin resistant, your metabolism is unhealthy and high in what I call ""metabolic friction"". If you then increase its rate you will likely accelerate your demise. To increase the quality of your metabolism you must be able to properly listen to insulin and especially to leptin.  If your fasting blood serum level of leptin is elevated you are likely leptin resistant and you will not be healthy unless you correct it.  How Do You Become Leptin Resistant?  This is the subject of much research. I believe people become leptin-resistant by the same general mechanism that people become insulin-resistant; by overexposure to high levels of the hormone.  High blood glucose levels cause repeated surges in insulin, and this causes one's cells to become ""insulin-resistant"" which leads to further high levels of insulin and diabetes. It is much the same as being in a smelly room for a period of time. Soon, you stop being able to smell it, because the signal no longer gets through. I believe the same happens with leptin. It has been shown that as sugar gets metabolized in fat cells, fat releases surges in leptin, and I believe that those surges result in leptin-resistance just as it results in insulin-resistance. The only known way to reestablish proper leptin (and insulin) signaling is to prevent those surges, and the only known way to do that is via diet and supplements.  As such, these can have a more profound effect on your health than any other known modality of medical treatment.  When leptin signaling is restored, your brain can finally hear the message that perhaps should have been delivered decades ago; high leptin levels can now scream to your brain that you have too much fat and that you better start burning some off for your life is in danger.  Your brain will finally allow you access into your pantry that you have been storing your fat in. Your cells will be fed the food from that fat and they will be satisfied. They will not know whether that food came from your belly fat or from your mouth; nor will they care. They will be receiving energy that they need and will not have to ask for more. You will not be hungry.  This also makes counting calories irrelevant, for the calories that you put into your mouth today are not necessarily what your cells will be eating; that will be determined primarily by leptin. Whether or not you put food into your mouth, your cells will be eating, and if they cannot eat fat they must eat sugar.  Since little sugar is stored, that sugar will be had by making you crave it, or by turning the protein in your muscle and bone into sugar. This contributes in a major way to weakness and osteoporosis. Whether or not this lean tissue wasting happens is determined by your capacity, or incapacity, to burn fat, and that is determined by your ability to listen to leptin. A strategic diet that emphasizes good fats and avoids blood sugar spikes coupled with targeted supplements (as recommended in my Rosedale Diet and Dr. Mercolas Take Control of Your Health), will enhance insulin and leptin sensitivity so that you can once again hear their music, allowing your life to be the symphony it was meant to be.

Vitamin D Has Been Shown to Dramatically Improve Fertility,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/02/16/the-vitamin-that-has-been-shown-to-dramatically-improve-infertility.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Did you know that in northern countries, which have dark, cold winters, couples are less likely to conceive during the winter, whereas conception rates peak in the summer?  There are a number of reasons why this association exists, but new research highlights vitamin D as one of the most important variable. Vitamin D, a steroid hormone that influences virtually every cell in your body and has been positively linked to health conditions ranging from cancer to heart disease, may significantly boost fertility in both men and women.  If Youre Struggling With Infertility, Get Your Vitamin D Levels Checked  Vitamin D is so crucial to health that I urge everyone to make sure their levels are optimized, but if youve been dealing with infertility, this is especially important.  A new report has shown that exposure to sunlight boosts fertility in both men and women by increasing their levels of vitamin D, a benefit that appears to work on multiple levels. As the researchers reported in the European Journal of Endocrinology:  Among women, vitamin D appears to impact in vitro fertilization (IVF) outcomes, endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS), the most common female endocrine disorder, as well as boost levels of progesterone and estrogen, which regulate menstrual cycles and improve the likelihood of successful conception  In men, vitamin D is essential for the healthy development of the nucleus of the sperm cell, and helps maintain semen quality and sperm count. Vitamin D also increases levels of testosterone, which may boost libido   The researchers state:  Given the high prevalence of infertility as well as vitamin D insufficiency in otherwise healthy young women and men and the possible role of vitamin D in human reproduction, research might lead to new therapeutic approaches such as vitamin D supplementation in the treatment of female and male reproductive disorders.  Low Vitamin D Levels Previously Linked to Infertility  This is not the first time the sunshine vitamin has been linked to infertility. In 2008, Australian fertility specialist Dr. Anne Clark found almost one-third of the 800 infertile men included in her study had lower than normal levels of vitamin D, (bear in mind here that ""normal"" does not equal ""optimal"" -- so by optimal standards, the rate of vitamin D deficiency was likely far higher than one-third) stating that:1   ""Vitamin D and folate deficiency are known to be associated with infertility in women, but the outcomes of the screening among men in our study group came as a complete surprise. Men in the study group who agreed to make lifestyle changes and take dietary supplements had surprisingly good fertility outcomes.""  In fact, of the 100 men who agreed to make and maintain certain lifestyle changes (quitting smoking, minimizing intake of caffeine and alcohol, weight reduction, along with a course of vitamins and antioxidants) for three months prior to fertility treatment, 11 of them went on to achieve pregnancy naturally, without IVF treatment. Previous studies, such as one published in The Journal of Nutrition, also found that although vitamin-D-deficient female rats were capable of reproduction, it reduced fertility by an astounding 75 percent, diminished litter sizes by 30 percent, and impaired neonatal growth.2 Interestingly, another study published in November 2009 confirmed that human sperm does in fact have a vitamin D receptor.3 Analysis indicated that vitamin D is produced locally in the sperm, which suggests that vitamin D may be involved in the signaling between cells in the reproductive system. According to the authors, the study revealed ""an unexpected significance of this hormone [vitamin D] in the acquisition of fertilizing ability,"" and the results imply that vitamin D is involved in a variety of sperm signaling pathways.  What Else Might be Impacting Your Fertility?  An estimated 1 in 6 American couples struggle with getting pregnant each year, and there's compelling evidence that lifestyle, diet and environmental exposures are largely to blame. Not only are you exposed to hundreds (if not thousands) of toxins each and every day, but some of the most commonly prescribed drugs, poor diet, and common vitamin deficiencies have also been linked to reduced fertility, just to name a few.  As Iva Keene, author of the Natural Fertility Prescription, stated:  Conventional IVF and other assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments dont address root causes of infertility. These root causes include: nutritional deficiencies, toxin exposure, stress, food intolerances, allergies and immune deficiencies. These subtle but critical factors interact synergistically to impact the quality of your eggs and sperm, affecting your ability to conceive and the health of your embryo.  during the generation and maturation of gamete cells -- sperm and ovum -- that form an embryo [a period of 120 days], everything that you and your partner ingest, inhale or are exposed to will influence the health of your eggs and sperm for better or worse, and the ultimate quality of the genetic building blocks you pass onto your child. This is why its crucial to follow a good preconception plan for a minimum of 4 months before conception. A baby is a 50-50 product of his or her parents -- therefore optimizing the quality of eggs and sperm is of paramount importance.  You can find 10 tips that may help resolve infertility naturally in her past article, but here are a few initial strategies to consider:  Genetically modified food (GM), especially corn and soy, contain significant concentrations of the herbicide glyphosate (the active ingredient in Roundup), which has been linked to infertility in a number of studies.  Avoid chemicals as much as possible. Bisphenol-A (BPA), phthalates, fluoride (in drinking water), MSG, and many, many others have shown negative impacts on your reproductive health.  Consume a healthy diet, rich in healthy fats and antioxidants, and low in sugar and grains. Insulin resistance is an underlying factor responsible for most chronic disease, and it should come as no surprise that it plays a role in fertility as well. The treatment strategy is to reduce or eliminate grains along with sugars, especially fructose.  Identify potential gluten intolerance. Celiac disease (gluten intolerance) has been linked to fertility problems in both sexes. In men, it's associated with abnormal sperm, such as lower sperm numbers, altered shape, and reduced function. Men with untreated celiac disease may also have lower testosterone levels.  Be aware of electromagnetic fields, as research suggests cell phones may impact sperm quality as well. One study found men who talked on a cell phone for more than four hours a day had the lowest average sperm counts (50 million per milliliter) and the least healthy sperm.4    Are You Ready to Optimize Your Vitamin D Levels?  This is an imperative step for anyone planning a pregnancy, not only for increasing the rate of conception but also for the benefits it offers during pregnancy. Vitamin D deficiency is currently at epidemic proportions in the United States and many other regions around the world, largely because people do not spend enough time in the sun to facilitate this important process of vitamin D production. So the first step to ensuring you are receiving all the benefits of vitamin D is to find out what your levels are using a 25(OH)D test, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. There are two vitamin D tests -- 1,25(OH)D and 25(OH)D -- but 25(OH)D is the better marker of overall D status. It is this marker that is most strongly associated with overall health, and it is the one you should ask your physician for.. The point of vitamin D testing is, of course, to be sure you are maintaining a therapeutic level of vitamin D in your blood. A few years back, the recommended level was between 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml), but more recently the optimal vitamin D level has been raised to 50-70 ng/ml.  To get your levels into the healthy range, sun exposure is the BEST way to optimize your vitamin D levels; exposing a large amount of your skin until it turns the lightest shade of pink, as near to solar noon as possible, is typically necessary to achieve adequate vitamin D production. If sun exposure is not an option, a safe tanning bed (with electronic ballasts rather than magnetic ballasts, to avoid unnecessary exposure to EMF fields) can be used.  As a last resort, a vitamin D3 supplement can be taken orally, but research suggests the average adult needs to take 8,000 IU's of vitamin D per day in order to elevate their levels above 40 ng/ml, which is the absolute minimum for disease prevention. For more details, be sure to read How to Get Your Vitamin D Within Healthy Ranges. Infertility can be a challenging condition with multiple contributing factors, but you have nothing to lose and everything to gain by optimizing your vitamin D levels. It is free if you do it via sun exposure, and inexpensive if you use a safe tanning bed or vitamin D3 supplement. Its a simple step that can have a profound impact on your health, even if trying to conceive naturally is not your primary goal.

What Pheromones Reveal About Your Love Life,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/02/28/pheromones.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Insects, fish, and non-human mammals all have pheromones, which are chemical signals that influence the behavior or physiology of other members of the same species. Pheromones may, for instance, divulge an animals age, gender, and emotional state, along with their social and reproductive status. Whether or not humans release pheromones, and what role they play considering humans have multiple other systems to acquire information, is a subject of debate and considerable research.  While the underpinnings of human pheromones are still being discovered, its clear that humans do communicate on a chemical level and, according to The Monell Chemical Senses Center, Its much more than we thought.1  Pheromones Likely Influence Sexual Attraction  If youve ever found yourself inexplicably attracted to a stranger youve just met, it could very well be their chemical signals that you find irresistible. Humans tend to be attracted to those with a dissimilar genetic make-up to themselves, which is signaled by subtle odors (though you probably dont consciously recognize).  This ensures genetic diversity for the species. For instance, its thought that each of us has a unique signature smell due to a collection of proteins called the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). MHCs help to regulate your immune system, and theres evidence that they also play a role in your selection of a mate.  Ideally, you would select a partner with MHCs quite different from your own, as this would diversify your childs immune system, making them better equipped to fight off pathogens. In one study, women sniffed shirts worn by men and selected those which theyd most like to socialize with. The women tended to choose men with dissimilar MHC except when they were taking birth control pills.  When a woman is on the Pill, her odor preferences change. The Pill essentially mimics pregnancy, and when a woman is pregnant, she tends to prefer the scent of men with similar MHC as her ownperhaps as a biological cue to now seek out and bond with supportive family members as opposed to potential mates.  What this means is that when you're taking a hormonal contraceptive, you interfere with your biology and risk producing a hormonal imbalance that might make you more attracted to men with similar chemical makeup.  If you were on the pill when you met your mate, you might, therefore, feel less attracted to him when you stop taking it. The studys lead author noted:2  Choosing a non-hormonal barrier method of contraception for a few months before getting married might be one way for a woman to check or reassure herself that shes still attracted to her partner.   Scientific Proof of Chemical Attraction  There are many fascinating studies that show there really can be an unconscious chemistry between two people. Often, this appears related to estrus, or the time in a womens menstrual cycle when shes most fertile and able to conceive.  One study involved professional lap dancers in a gentlemens club. The women earned the most tips just prior to ovulation, the most fertile period, and the least tips during menstruation.3 Women taking birth control pills, however, did not show a significant difference in tips throughout their cycle. A separate study involved men smelling t-shirts worn by women who were about to ovulate. The men had higher testosterone levels than when they smelled t-shirts from women not about to ovulate or those with a control scent. According to the study:4  Hence, olfactory cues signaling women's levels of reproductive fertility were associated with specific endocrinological responses in men--responses that have been linked to sexual behavior and the initiation of romantic courtship.  There are actually a growing number of studies showing that scent communication may play a central role in mating not just in non-human mammals but in humans as well. For instance, men may perceive women's high-fertility body scents (collected near ovulation) as more attractive than their low-fertility body scents.5  A Womans Fertility Status May Influence a Mans Behavior  Research even shows that subtle signs of womens fertility influences mens mating cognition and behavior and facilitates psychological and behavioral processes associated with the pursuit of a sexual partner. According to one series of studies:6  In Study 1, men exposed to the scent of a woman near peak levels of fertility displayed increased accessibility to sexual concepts. Study 2 demonstrated that, among men who reported being sensitive to odors, scent cues of fertility triggered heightened perceptions of women's sexual arousal.  Study 3 revealed that, in a face-to-face interaction, high levels of female fertility were associated with a greater tendency for men to make risky decisions and to behaviorally mimic a female partner. Hence, subtle cues of fertility led to a cascade of mating-related processes-from lower order cognition to overt behavior-that reflected heightened mating motivation. The opposite may also hold true, in that women who smelled mens sweat reported feeling less tense and more relaxed than women who smelled a placebo. Researchers also detected a shift in luteinizing hormone, which typically surge just prior to ovulation (but also peaks hundreds of times during the menstrual cycle).7   6 Weird Facts About Kissing  While were on the topic of attraction, you may be surprised to learn that that first kiss (or the many after) may serve a very important purpose. Actually, it may serve multiple purposes. As reported in TIME:8 1. Kissing May Build Your Immunity  A 10-second kiss may transfer 80 million germs from one mouth to another. As you pass these bugs around, your body can build up immunity to them. One such bug is cytomegalovirus, which lurks in saliva. It normally causes no problems, but it can be extremely dangerous if caught while pregnant and can kill unborn babies or cause birth defects. Research suggests that kissing the same person for about six months may provide optimum protection and allow women time to build up immunity against cytomegalovirus. Writing in the journal Medical Hypotheses, researcher Dr. Colin Hendrie from the University of Leeds said:9  Female inoculation with a specific male's cytomegalovirus is most efficiently achieved through mouth-to-mouth contact and saliva exchange, particularly where the flow of saliva is from the male to the typically shorter female.   2. Kissing Is Another Way to Assess Your Potential Mate  Women rate kissing differently at different points in their menstrual cycle. When theyre close to ovulation, romantic kissing is rated as more important.10  3. It May Boost Libido  French kissing is enjoyed by both men and women in long-term relationships, but in short-term relationships its the men who tend to prefer it. According to Laura Berman, PhD, assistant clinical professor of ob-gyn and psychiatry at the Feinberg School of Medicine at Northwestern University: One theory is that their saliva transfers testosterone to the woman, which in turn increases her sexual desire.  4. Boost Your Mood  Kissing triggers the release of feel-good chemicals like endorphins while lowering levels of the stress hormone cortisol.  5. Strengthen Your Relationship  People who report frequent kissing have greater levels of sexual satisfaction in their relationship. Men who kiss frequently also report feeling three times happier in their relationship than men who do not.  6. The Longest Kiss  The longest kiss award goes to Ekkachai Tiranarat and Laksana Tiranarat, who kissed for 58 hours, 35 minutes, and 58 seconds in 2013!   Beyond Romance: Chemical Signals May Influence Mood, Social Support and More   Chemical signals arent only reserved for attracting a mate. They influence a complex array of biological processes and human relationships. For instance:  Women who sniffed fear-induced sweat became more mentally alert and intelligent, according to a study in Chemical Senses.11 According to researchers, Humans distinguish between fear and other emotional chemosignals based on olfactory cues. Women who sniffed the scent of 2-day-old babies had increased activity in the reward-related areas of their brain.12 Exposure to other womens pheromones may cause womens menstrual cycles to speed up or slow down.13 Odors collected from pads in the underarm and breast area of breastfeeding women changed menstrual cycle length and sexual motivation in other women.14 Chemical communication may convey social support, for instance among a support group for breastfeeding women.15  So while it seems clear that chemical signals, including pheromones, play a role in sexual attraction and finding a mate, they likely influence other key relationships as well, such as those between you and your child and, possibly, even close friends. These signals may help you avoid potentially threatening situations and may one day even be harnessed to help diagnose diseases (some of which also emit a unique odor production). So you might want to think twice about covering up your own natural scent with artificial perfumes. As neuroscientist Charles Wysocki observed:16  With every little piece ofinformation we gain, we scrape away a little bit of blackness on the window. As wepeek through a little more and begin to see thathumans have the potential to communicatewith chemical signals, were finding thathuman behavior and physiology respond much more to chemical communication than we originally believed.

Vitamin D May Help Ease Menstrual Cramps,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/03/14/can-vitamin-d3-ease-menstrual-cramps.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola At least half of reproductive-age women suffer from painful menstrual cramps that begin shortly before the start of menstrual flow and continue for several days.  For some the pain is a mild annoyance, but for others it can be so severe that it interferes with daily activities. Severe menstrual cramps are actually among the most common reasons for missed work and school days among young women. For treatment, many women rely on over-the-counter NSAIDs like ibuprofen for pain relief, and conventional physicians may even prescribe birth control pills, which prevent ovulation and reduce the severity of cramps. Both of these ""solutions"" carry significant risks of side effects while doing nothing to treat the underlying reasons why menstrual cramps occur. Now researchers have uncovered another option that might ease menstrual cramp pain naturally via the ""sunshine vitamin,"" or vitamin D. Vitamin D Might Relieve Menstrual Cramp Pain During menstruation, your uterus contracts to expel its lining, a process that's triggered by hormone-like substances called prostaglandins.  Prostaglandins are associated with both pain and inflammation, and higher levels of these substances are linked to more severe menstrual cramps. Vitamin D not only helps to decrease the production of prostaglandins, it also helps decrease the production of cytokines, which promote inflammation in your body.  In fact, researchers recently revealed that women with relatively low vitamin D levels (less than 45 nanograms per milliliter (ng/mL)) who took a 300,000 IU mega-dose of vitamin D3 had a significant reduction in menstrual cramp pain. Two months after taking the vitamin D, the women rated their pain more than 2 points lower on a scale of 1-10, and all had stopped using painkillers. On the other hand, those who had taken a placebo reported no reduction in pain, and 40 percent were still taking pain medications. These are impressive results, however I would caution you against taking this massive dose of vitamin D, especially without medical supervision, as it is possible to overdose on vitamin D when taken in supplement form especially when your vitamin A (not beta carotene) and vitamin K2 are not properly balanced. Very high doses of vitamin D3 supplements may lead to hypercalcemia (high blood calcium) over time. This can result in deposits of calcium in your heart, lungs or kidneys, and the damage can be permanent if your vitamin D levels remain elevated for too long. The ideal way to optimize your vitamin D levels is through safe sun exposure, as this carries virtually no risk of overdosing on vitamin D.  Regular, Consistent Dosing is Best to Optimize Your Vitamin D Vitamin D deficiency is currently at epidemic proportions in the United States and many other regions around the world, largely because people do not spend enough time in the sun to facilitate this important process of vitamin D production. This is linked to a number of serious health conditions including cancer and heart disease, not to mention that researchers in the above study found that the lower a woman's level of vitamin D, the more menstrual cramp pain she experienced. So the first step to ensuring you are receiving all the benefits of vitamin D is to find out what your levels are using a 25(OH)D test, also called 25-hydroxyvitamin D. There are two vitamin D tests -- 1,25(OH)D and 25(OH)D -- but 25(OH)D is the better marker of overall D status. It is this marker that is most strongly associated with overall health, and it is the one you should ask your physician for. The point of vitamin D testing is, of course, to be sure you are maintaining a therapeutic level of vitamin D in your blood. A few years back, the recommended level was between 40 to 60 nanograms per milliliter (ng/ml), but more recently the optimal vitamin D level has been raised to at least 50 ng/ml.

As a last resort, a vitamin D3 supplement can be taken orally, but research suggests the average adult needs to take 8,000 IU's of vitamin D per day in order to elevate their levels above 40 ng/ml, which is the absolute minimum for disease prevention. The dosage that is right for you will be determined, ultimately, by how much is needed to keep your levels in the therapeutic range above. For more details, be sure to read How to Get Your Vitamin D Within Healthy Ranges. What's Wrong with Conventional Treatments for Menstrual Cramps? If you visit a conventional physician complaining of menstrual cramps, you're likely to leave the office with a prescription for one of two medications: an NSAID or an oral contraceptive. Aside from the fact that these only cover up your symptoms, and do nothing to heal the problem, they carry significant risks. These are made even worse since most women with menstrual cramps seek long-term relief, and may take the drugs for many months or even years. NSAIDs NSAIDs (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs) are linked to serious gastrointestinal risks, like bleeding of the digestive tract, increased blood pressure and kidney problems. This applies not only to prescription medications like Celebrex but also over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, Advil and Motrin. NSAIDs are also notoriously bad for your heart; a study by researchers at The University of Bern in Switzerland revealed that NSAIDs lead to a two to fourfold increase in the risk of heart attacks, stroke or cardiovascular death, noting that it would only take 25-50 patients being treated with NSAIDs for one year to lead to an additional heart attack or stroke.1 Birth Control Pills Hormonal birth control methods like ""the pill"" contain synthetic progesterone and synthetic estrogen -- something that is clearly not advantageous if you want to maintain optimal health. These contraceptives contain the same synthetic hormones as those used in hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which has well-documented risks, including an increased risk of blood clots, stroke, heart attack, and breast cancer.  In fact, studies have found that HRT increases post-menopausal women's breast cancer risk by at least one percent per year, and HRT with progestin increases your risk by eight percent per year, potentially going as high as 30 percent after just four years of use! Furthermore, using birth control pills to relieve menstrual cramps is counterproductive, because you may end up simply exchanging them for another health condition. Birth control pills have been linked to an increased risk of:     Cancer: Women who take birth control pills increase their risk of cervical and breast cancers, and possibly liver cancer as well.  Thinner bones: Women who take birth control pills have lower bone mineral density (BMD) than women who have never used oral contraceptives.  Heart disease: Long-term use of birth control pills may increase plaque artery buildups in your body that may raise your risk of heart disease.    Fatal blood clots: All birth control pills increase your risk of blood clots and subsequent stroke. And if your prescription contains the synthetic hormone desogestrel, your risk of fatal blood clots nearly doubles!  Impaired muscle gains: A recent study found that oral contraceptive use impairs muscle gains from resistance exercise training in women.  Long-term sexual dysfunction: The Pill may interfere with a protein that keeps testosterone unavailable, leading to long-term sexual dysfunction including decreased desire and arousal.    Migraines  Weight gain and mood changes  Yeast overgrowth and infection    More Natural Strategies to Ease Menstrual Cramps If painful menstrual cramps are interfering with your quality of life, there are a number of safe, natural strategies to consider, in addition to optimizing your vitamin D levels.   Evening Primrose Oil: This contains the essential fatty acid gamma linolenic acid (GLA), which is useful for treating pain. It is also helpful to restore abnormal hormone physiology, which can contribute to PMS symptoms.   DIM (diindolylmethane): DIM is a natural phytochemical found in cruciferous vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage and Brussels sprouts. It has unique properties that allow it to modify the metabolism of estrogen, promoting optimal estrogen balance and supporting healthy progesterone and testosterone production. The severity of PMS symptoms in women has been linked to elevated estrogen, with symptoms becoming more severe as estrogen rises.2 DIM exerts a balancing effect on hormones and may benefit conditions like PMS, which are associated with estrogen-progesterone imbalance.   Chinese Herbs: Chinese herbal medicine has been used to treat menstrual pain for hundreds of years, and one study found certain Chinese herbs were more effective than NSAIDs, oral contraceptive pills, acupuncture, heat compressions, placebos, or no treatment at all in relieving menstrual cramp pain.3 Herbs in the study included:    Chinese angelica root   Szechuan lovage root   Red peony root, white peony root   Chinese motherwort   Cinnamon bark    Acupuncture: A review of 27 studies found that acupuncture may alleviate menstrual cramps better than drugs or herbal medicine by stimulating the production of endorphins and serotonin in your central nervous system.4   Dietary changes: Dietary changes can be very useful to relieve cramping and other PMS symptoms. You can try:    Avoiding caffeine, alcohol, and carbonated drinks    Reducing your sugar intake    Avoiding smoked cheeses, meats, and fish (as they can increase your fluid retention)    Making sure you're getting enough nutrients in your diet, specifically vitamin B6, manganese, vitamins A and E, calcium, magnesium, animal-based omega-3 fats and tryptophan     Exercise: This is another useful tool that helps to relieve menstrual cramps, perhaps because it raises your levels of endorphins, which are chemicals in your brain that are associated with pain relief.    Heat: Using a hot water bottle on your lower abdomen or soaking in a warm bath may provide temporary relief of menstrual pain.

This Hormone Makes Counting Calories Irrelevant,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/06/20/this-hormone-makes-counting-calories-irrelevant.aspx,"By Ron Rosedale, M.D.  It is amazing how the little twists and turns of researchers can have such a profound impact on what we generally come to realize as scientific truth. Let me share a recent fascinating example of how this impacted one of the most powerful hormones in your body. The Ob mouse is a strain of mouse that has a genetic mutation that makes it obese and unhealthy. It has been used for many years as a model of obesity to do research on, though the reason that it was obese had eluded scientists.  This changed when, in 1994, Jeffrey Friedman discovered that this mouse lacked a previously unknown hormone called leptin, and when it was injected with leptin it became thin, vibrant, and very healthy within weeks. This made headlines around the world, ""the cure for obesity found"" and pharmaceutical companies started tripping over themselves with trillion dollar signs in their eyes to be the first to genetically manufacture leptin on a large-scale.  This did not last long. When people were tested for leptin, it was found that, unlike the Ob mouse, they did not lack leptin; on the contrary almost all overweight and obese people have excess leptin.  These people were ""leptin resistant"" and giving extra leptin did little good.  The financial disappointment was extreme and scientists working for pharmaceutical companies said that leptin wasn't important anymore since they could not find a drug to control it, and therefore the industry couldn't make money on it. To make big money in medicine one needs a patent and this generally means remedies which are not commonly or easily available -- that are not natural.  This illustrates two extremely unfortunate principles in modern medicine; only those therapies that will make lots of money (generally for the pharmaceutical industry or hospitals), ever get pursued and then taught to physicians (since most of medical education after medical school takes place by drug reps), and these therapies, almost by definition, will be unnatural.  This inhibition of extremely important knowledge is not only unfortunate, it is deadly, and is exemplified by how few people, including doctors, know anything about leptin, though I would consider it to be the most important chemical in your body that will determine your health and lifespan.  Two Hormones that are Vital for Optimal Health  Each and every one of us is a combination of lives within lives. We are made up of trillions of individual living cells that each must maintain itself. Even more significantly, the cells must communicate and interact with each other to form a republic of cells that we call our individual self.  Our health and life depends on how accurately instructions are conveyed to our cells so that they can act in harmony. It is the communication among the individual cells that will determine our health and our life.  The communication takes place by hormones. Arguably therefore, the most important molecules in your body that ultimately will decide your health and life are hormones.  Many would say that genes and chromosomes are the most important molecules, however once born your genes pretty much just sit there; hormones tell them what to do. Certainly, the most important message that our cells receive is how and what to do with energy,and therefore life cannot take place without that.  The two most important hormones that deliver messages about energy and metabolism are insulin and leptin. Metabolism can roughly be defined as the chemistry that turns food into life, and therefore insulin and leptin are critical to health and disease. Both insulin and leptin work together to control the quality of your metabolism (and, to a significant extent, the rate of metabolism).  Insulin works mostly at the individual cell level, telling the vast majority of cells whether to burn or store fat or sugar and whether to utilize that energy for maintenance and repair or reproduction. This is extremely important as we shall see, for on an individual cell level turning on maintenance and repair equates to increased longevity, and turning up cellular reproduction can increase your risk of cancer. Leptin, on the other hand, controls the energy storage and utilization of the entire republic of cells allowing the body to communicate with the brain about how much energy (fat) the republic has stored, and whether it needs more, or should burn some off, and whether it is an advantageous time nutritionally-speaking for the republic --you-- to reproduce or not.  What Exactly is Leptin?  Leptin is a very powerful and influential hormone produced by fat cells that has totally changed the way that science (real science, outside of medicine) looks at fat, nutrition, and metabolism in general.  Prior to leptin's discovery, fat was viewed as strictly an ugly energy storage depot that most everyone was trying to get rid of. After it was discovered that fat produced the hormone leptin (and subsequently it was discovered that fat produced other very significant hormones), fat became an endocrine organ like the ovaries, pancreas and pituitary, influencing the rest of the body and, in particular, the brain.  Leptin, as far as science currently knows, is the most powerful regulator that tells your brain what to do about life's two main biological goals: eating and reproduction. Your fat, by way of leptin, tells your brain whether you should be hungry, eat and make more fat, whether you should reproduce and make babies, or (partly by controlling insulin) whether to ""hunker down"" and work overtime to maintain and repair yourself.  I believe I could now make a very convincing and scientifically accurate statement that that rather than your brain being in control of the rest of your body, your brain is, in fact, subservient to your fat -- and leptin. In short, leptin is the way that your fat stores speak to your brain to let your brain know how much energy is available and, very importantly, what to do with it. Therefore, leptin may be ""on top of the food chain"" in metabolic importance and relevance to disease.  How Leptin Regulates Your Weight  It has been known for many years that fat stores are highly regulated. It appeared that when one tried to lose weight the body would try to gain it back. This commonly results in ""yo-yo"" dieting and in scientific circles one talks about the ""set point"" of weight. It has long been theorized that there must be a hormone that determines this.  Science points now to leptin as being that hormone. In our ancestral history, it was advantageous to store some fat to call upon during times of famine. However, it was equally disadvantageous to be too fat. For most of our evolutionary history, it was necessary to run, to obtain prey and perhaps most importantly, to avoid being prey. If a lion was chasing a group of people it would most likely catch and eliminate from the gene pool the slowest runner and the one who could not make it up the tree -- the fattest one. Thus, fat storage had to be highly regulated and this is done, as is any regulation, through hormones, the most significant being leptin.  If a person is getting too fat, the extra fat produces more leptin which is supposed to tell the brain that there is too much fat stored, more should not be stored, and the excess should be burned.  Signals are therefore sent to an area of the brain in the hypothalamus (the arcuate nucleus) to stop being hungry, to stop eating, to stop storing fat and to start burning some extra fat off.  Controlling hunger is a major (though not the only) way that leptin controls energy storage. Hunger is a very powerful, ancient, and deep-seated drive that, if stimulated long enough, will make you eat and store more energy. Asking somebody to not eat, to voluntarily restrict calories even though they are hungry, is asking the near impossible. The only way to eat less in the long-term is to not be hungry, and the only way to do this is to control the hormones that regulate hunger, the primary one being leptin.  How Leptin Resistance Leads to Disease  More recently, it has been found that leptin not only changes brain chemistry, but can also ""rewire"" the very important areas of the brain that control hunger and metabolism. I'm not aware of any other chemical in the body that has been shown to accomplish this ""mind bending"" event. This has really caught the attention of the scientific community. Further studies have now shown that leptin, or more correctly the inability of the body to properly hear leptins signals, in other words leptin resistance, plays significant if not primary roles in heart disease, obesity, diabetes, osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases, reproductive disorders, and perhaps the rate of aging itself.  It helps to control the brain areas that regulate thyroid levels and the sympathetic nervous system which also has huge impacts on blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes, osteoporosis and aging. Leptin's stimulatory effect on the sympathetic nervous system also helps determine the adrenal stress response including cortisol levels.  Leptin May Be Even More Critical Than Insulin  The importance of insulin in health and disease is becoming well-known. Aside from its obvious role in diabetes, it plays a very significant role in hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and cancer.  I was one of the first to speak publicly to doctors about insulins critical role in health well over a decade ago (see the transcribed talk Insulin and its Metabolic Effects) and I am even more convinced now.  However leptin may even supersede insulin in importance, for new research is revealing that in the long run glucose and therefore insulin levels may be largely determined by leptin. It had been previously believed that the insulin sensitivity of muscle and fat tissues were the most important factor in determining whether one would become diabetic or not. Elegant new studies are showing that the brain and liver are most important in regulating a persons blood sugar levels especially in type 2 or insulin resistant diabetes.  It should be noted again that leptin plays a vital role in regulating your brains hypothalamic activity which in turn regulates much of a persons ""autonomic"" functions; those functions that you don't necessarily think about but which determines much of your life (and health) such as body temperature, heart rate, hunger, the stress response, fat burning or storage, reproductive behavior, and newly discovered roles in bone growth and blood sugar levels.  Another very recent study reveals leptin's importance in directly regulating how much sugar that the liver manufactures via gluconeogenesis. Many chronic diseases are now linked to excess inflammation such as heart disease and diabetes. High leptin levels are very pro-inflammatory, and leptin also helps to mediate the manufacture of other very potent inflammatory chemicals from fat cells that also play a significant role in the progression of heart disease and diabetes. It has long been known that obesity greatly increased risk for many chronic diseases including heart disease and diabetes, but no one really knew why.   Leptin appears to be the missing link.  Could Leptin Also Affect How Fast You Age?  Leptin will not only determine how much fat you have, but also where that fat is put. When you are leptin resistant you put that fat mostly in your belly, your viscera, causing the so-called ""apple shape"" that is linked to much disease. Some of that fat permeates the liver, impeding the liver's ability to listen to insulin, and further hastening diabetes.   Leptin plays a far more important role in your health than, for instance, cholesterol, yet how many doctors measure leptin levels in their patients, know their own level, even know that it can be easily measured, or even what it would mean? Leptin appears to play a significant role in obesity, heart disease, osteoporosis, autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. These are the so-called ""chronic diseases of aging"".  Could it perhaps affect the rate of aging itself?   The Biology of Aging  Scientists who study the biology of aging are beginning to look at that question. There are two endeavors, two drives that life has been programmed, since its inception, to succeed at and to succumb to. These are to eat and to reproduce.  If every one of our ancestors had not succeeded in eating and reproducing we would not be here, and this paper would be moot. All of your morphological characteristics from your hair to your toenails are designed to help you succeed at those two activities. That is what nature wants us to do. Nature's purpose is not necessarily to have you live a long and healthy life, but to perpetuate the instructions, the genes that tell how to perpetuate life.  Even so-called ""paleolithic"" diets, though undoubtedly far better than what is generally eaten today, were not necessarily designed by nature to help us live a long and healthy life but, at best, to maximize reproduction. Nature appears to not care much about what happens to us after we have had a sufficient chance to reproduce. That is why we die.  But there are clues as to how to live a long and healthy life. And that brings us once again to fat--and leptin. It takes energy to make babies; lots of it. Energy was and always will be a coveted commodity. Nature, and evolution, hates wasting it. It makes no sense to try and make babies when it appears that there's not enough energy available to successfully accomplish that goal.  Instead, it seems that virtually all living forms can ""switch gears"" and direct energy away from reproduction and towards mechanism that will allow it to ""hunker down"" for the long haul and thus be able to reproduce at a future more nutritionally opportune time. In other words nature will then let you live longer to accomplish its primary directive of reproduction.  It does this by up regulating maintenance and repair genes that increase production of intracellular antioxidant systems, heat shock proteins (that help maintain protein shape), and DNA repair enzymes. This is what happens when you restrict calories (without starvation) in animals, and that has been shown convincingly for 70 years to greatly extend the life span of many dozens of species. Thus, there is a powerful link between reproduction, energy stores, and longevity.  Genetic studies in simple organisms have shown that that link is at least partially mediated by insulin (which in simple organisms also functions as a growth hormone), and that when insulin signals are kept low, indicating scarce energy availability, maximal lifespan can be extended--- a lot; several hundred percent in worms and flies.  Glucose is an ancient fuel used even before there was oxygen in the atmosphere, for life can burn glucose without oxygen; it is an anaerobic fuel. The use of fat as fuel came later, after life in the form of plants soaked the earth in oxygen, for you cannot burn fat without oxygen.  The primary source of energy stores in people by far is fat, as many unfortunately are all too aware of. The primary signal that indicates how much fat is stored is leptin, and it is also leptin that allows for reproduction, or not.  It has long been known that women with very little body fat, such as marathon runners, stop ovulating. There is not enough leptin being produced to permit it. Paradoxically, the first pharmaceutical use of leptin was recently approved to give to skinny women to allow them to reproduce.   Leptins Role in Improving Your Metabolism  Leptin also is instrumental in regulating body temperature, partly by controlling the rate of metabolism via its regulation of the thyroid.   Metabolic rate and temperature has long been connected with longevity. Almost all mechanisms that extend lifespan in many different organisms result in lower temperature. Flowers are refrigerated at the florist to extend their lifespan. Restricting calories in animals also results in lower temperature, reduced thyroid levels, and longer life.   It should be noted that reduced thyroid levels in this case are not synonymous with hypothyroidism. Here, the body is choosing to lower thyroid hormones because the increased efficiency of energy use and hormonal signaling (including perhaps thyroid) is allowing this to happen. Anything will dissolve faster in hot water than cold water. Extra heat will dissolve, disrupt and disorganize. This is not what I try to do to make someone healthy. It is commonly advised to ""increase metabolism"" and increase ""thermogenesis"" for health and weight loss.  Yet how many of you would put a brand of gasoline in your car that advertised that it would make your engine run hotter? What would that do to the life of your car? It is not an increase in metabolism that I am after; it is improved metabolic quality.  That will be determined at the quality of your leptin signaling.  If it is poor, if you are insulin and leptin resistant, your metabolism is unhealthy and high in what I call ""metabolic friction"". If you then increase its rate you will likely accelerate your demise. To increase the quality of your metabolism you must be able to properly listen to insulin and especially to leptin.  If your fasting blood serum level of leptin is elevated you are likely leptin resistant and you will not be healthy unless you correct it.  How Do You Become Leptin Resistant?  This is the subject of much research. I believe people become leptin-resistant by the same general mechanism that people become insulin-resistant; by overexposure to high levels of the hormone.  High blood glucose levels cause repeated surges in insulin, and this causes one's cells to become ""insulin-resistant"" which leads to further high levels of insulin and diabetes. It is much the same as being in a smelly room for a period of time. Soon, you stop being able to smell it, because the signal no longer gets through. I believe the same happens with leptin. It has been shown that as sugar gets metabolized in fat cells, fat releases surges in leptin, and I believe that those surges result in leptin-resistance just as it results in insulin-resistance. The only known way to reestablish proper leptin (and insulin) signaling is to prevent those surges, and the only known way to do that is via diet and supplements.  As such, these can have a more profound effect on your health than any other known modality of medical treatment.  When leptin signaling is restored, your brain can finally hear the message that perhaps should have been delivered decades ago; high leptin levels can now scream to your brain that you have too much fat and that you better start burning some off for your life is in danger.  Your brain will finally allow you access into your pantry that you have been storing your fat in. Your cells will be fed the food from that fat and they will be satisfied. They will not know whether that food came from your belly fat or from your mouth; nor will they care. They will be receiving energy that they need and will not have to ask for more. You will not be hungry.  This also makes counting calories irrelevant, for the calories that you put into your mouth today are not necessarily what your cells will be eating; that will be determined primarily by leptin. Whether or not you put food into your mouth, your cells will be eating, and if they cannot eat fat they must eat sugar.  Since little sugar is stored, that sugar will be had by making you crave it, or by turning the protein in your muscle and bone into sugar. This contributes in a major way to weakness and osteoporosis. Whether or not this lean tissue wasting happens is determined by your capacity, or incapacity, to burn fat, and that is determined by your ability to listen to leptin. A strategic diet that emphasizes good fats and avoids blood sugar spikes coupled with targeted supplements (as recommended in my Rosedale Diet and Dr. Mercolas Take Control of Your Health), will enhance insulin and leptin sensitivity so that you can once again hear their music, allowing your life to be the symphony it was meant to be.

What Is Postpartum Depression and What Causes It?,http://articles.mercola.com/depression/postpartum-depression.aspx,"Giving birth is a joyful and exciting experience for most mothers. After months of waiting and anticipating, there's nothing more fulfilling than finally holding your newborn in your arms.    But unfortunately, not all moms feel like this. In fact, some generally feel overwhelmed and become prone to the ""baby blues""  an emotional reaction wherein the mother feels anxious, weepy, irritable, moody and unable to sleep.1  Usually, baby blues go away after two week or less. But in some mothers, these emotions do not go away and intensify instead. They often become more severe and long-lasting, resulting in extreme sadness, difficulty bonding with their baby and even having thoughts of death and suicide.    When this happens, this is no longer a simple case of baby blues  it's already postpartum depression.  What Is Postpartum Depression and What Causes It?   As its name implies, postpartum depression (also called postnatal depression) is a mood disorder that can affect a mother after giving birth.2 It's a common problem that's believed to affect more than 1 in every 10 women within the first year after childbirth. Postpartum depression may also affect fathers and partners, but this is rare.3   Experts haven't determined one single cause for postpartum depression; however, it's speculated to come from a combination of emotional and physical factors. One possible cause is the fluctuating hormones due to pregnancy.    After a woman gives birth, the levels of hormones (estrogen and progesterone in particular) in her body drop quickly. As a result, chemical changes occur in her brain, triggering mood swings.    Another cause is the lack of time to fully recover from childbirth. Mothers are often sleep deprived as they try to accommodate their newborn's needs, leading to exhaustion and physical discomfort, which then contribute to postnatal depression symptoms.4   Mothers who suffer from postpartum depression usually exhibit different behaviors. Postpartum Progress has a comprehensive list of symptoms,5 such as:      Feeling overwhelmed and/or guilty    Not bonding with the baby    Being irritated, angry or moody    Extreme sadness and hopelessness    Lack of appetite    Inability to sleep and concentrate    Feeling disconnected from the rest of the world     Although rare, some mothers develop more severe symptoms when dealing with depression. They lose interest in their newborn child, and/or think about (or even attempt) hurting themselves and/or their baby. Some develop hallucinations and may even have suicidal thoughts.6  How Long Does Postpartum Depression Last?  Aside from being more severe than baby blues in terms of symptoms, postpartum depression actually lasts longer. It can begin any time after childbirth, from a few days or weeks after the baby is born up to six months after delivery. If left untreated, this disorder can last for many months or even longer, interfering with the mother's ability to care for the child or do other chores and tasks.7  Try These Natural Postpartum Depression Remedies  While many conventional healthcare practitioners will immediately recommend antidepressants as your primary postpartum depression treatment method, remember that these drugs may do more harm than good. Some antidepressants are also ill-advised especially if you're breastfeeding.8  Instead, try these natural methods to get rid of this disorder:    Increase your omega-3 intake. A study has shown that insufficient dietary intake of omega-3s may increase a woman's risk of postpartum depression.9 You can get omega-3s from foods like wild Alaskan salmon, small fish like sardines and anchovies, and flax seeds and chia seeds. Supplementing with high-quality krill oil is also recommended.10  Get vitamin B2. It may decrease your risk of this type of depression if consumed in moderation.11  Herbs and supplements. These may help treat depression in general (and postpartum depression in particular), however, you may need to consult with your physician if these are safe to take, especially if you're breastfeeding. For example, St. John's wort has mixed evidence regarding its safety when taken while breastfeeding.   Additionally, make sure to evaluate your lifestyle and determine how you can limit or reduce your stress, so you will be able to better recover from this disorder. Here are a few tips to remember:12      Connect with your partner, friends and family. Let them know that you need their guidance and support. Don't hesitate to ask for help, especially for caring for your baby, if you truly need it.    Accept help from others. Consider if you need to hire extra help to do tasks like cooking, housework and shopping, so that you can spend more time and bond with your baby.    Make time for yourself. Allot time for relaxing and enjoyable activities. Meditate, go for a walk, take a warm bath, listen to music or read a book.    Rest whenever you can. Sleep if you get the chance. Take ""shifts"" with your partner, so that you can get enough shuteye.    Exercise regularly. It helps boost people's mood.    Nourish yourself with regular, healthy meals made from wholesome organic foods. Avoid processed foods and don't go for long periods without having a snack.    Avoid substances like alcohol or recreational drugs, which can only make you feel worse.

Advances in Understanding of Depression Offer New Hope,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/01/22/depression-causes.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Depression is thought to affect about one in 10 Americans.1 In 2010, antidepressants were the second most commonly prescribed type of medication in the US,2 hinting at the severity of the problem. Contrary to popular belief, depression is not likely caused by unbalanced brain chemicals; however there are a number of other biological factors that appear to be highly significant. Chronic inflammation is one. As noted in the featured article:3  George Slavich, a clinical psychologist at the University of California in Los Angeles, has spent years studying depression, and has come to the conclusion that it has as much to do with the body as the mind.  I dont even talk about it as a psychiatric condition anymore, he says. It does involve psychology, but it also involves equal parts of biology and physical health. The basis of this new view is blindingly obvious once it is pointed out: everyone feels miserable when they are ill. That feeling of being too tired, bored and fed up to move off the sofa and get on with life is known among psychologists as sickness behaviour.  It happens for a good reason, helping us avoid doing more damage or spreading an infection any further. It also looks a lot like depression.  One researcher even goes so far as to suggest depression should be rebranded as an infectious but non-contagious disease,4 while the author of the featured article playfully compares depression with an allergic reactionin this case an allergy to modern lifeconsidering the many environmental factors that are known to cause inflammation, from diet to toxic exposures and stress. Scientists have also found that your mental health can be adversely impacted by factors such as vitamin D deficiency and/or unbalanced gut floraboth of which, incidentally, play a role in keeping inflammation in check, which is really what the remedy to depression is all about. Inflammation and Depression  As discussed in an article by Dr Brogan, depressive symptoms can be viewed as downstream manifestations of inflammation.   The source itself may be singularly or multiply-focused as stress, dietary and toxic exposures, and infection... [I]nflammation appears to be a highly relevant determinant of depressive symptoms such as flat mood, slowed thinking, avoidance, alterations in perception, and metabolic changes,5 she writes. Certain biomarkers, such as cytokines in your blood and inflammatory messengers like CRP, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, show promise as potential new diagnostic tools, as theyre predictive6 and linearly7 correlative with depression.  For example, researchers have found8 that melancholic depression, bipolar disorder, and postpartum depression, are associated with elevated levels of cytokines in combination with decreased cortisol sensitivity (cortisol is both a stress hormone and a buffer against inflammation). As explained by Dr. Brogan:  Once triggered in the body, these inflammatory agents transfer information to the nervous system, typically through stimulation of major nerves such as the vagus, which connects9 the gut and brain. Specialized cells called microglia in the brain represent the brains immune hubs and are activated in inflammatory states.  In activated microglia, an enzyme called IDO (indoleamine 2 3-dioxygenase) has been shown10 to direct tryptophan away from the production of serotonin and melatonin and towards the production of an NMDA agonist called quinolinic acid that may be responsible for symptoms of anxiety and agitation.  These are just some of the changes that may conspire to let your brain in on what your body may know is wrong. Using Brain Scans to Help Choose Treatment Type  Speaking of biomarkers, research11 by Dr. Helen Mayberg, a professor of psychiatry at Emory University, may also pave the way toward a more refined and customized treatment plan. Her research is discussed in the video above.  Dr. Mayberg has identified a biomarker in the brain that can be used to predict whether a depressed patient is a good candidate for medication, or might be better off with psychotherapy. As noted by the New York Times:12  Patients who had low activity in a brain region called the anterior insula measured before treatment responded quite well to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT} but poorly to Lexapro; conversely, those with high activity in this region had an excellent response to Lexapro, but did poorly with CBT....  [T]he insula is centrally involved in the capacity for emotional self-awareness, cognitive control and decision making, all of which are impaired by depression. Perhaps cognitive behavior therapy has a more powerful effect than an antidepressant in patients with an underactive insula because it teaches patients to control their emotionally disturbing thoughts in a way that an antidepressant cannot. The Links Between Gut and Mental Health  A number of studies have confirmed that gastrointestinal inflammation specifically can play a critical role in the development of depression, suggesting that beneficial bacteria (probiotics) may be an important part of treatment. For example, a Hungarian scientific review13 published in 2011 made the following observations:  Depression is often found alongside gastrointestinal inflammations and autoimmune diseases as well as with cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, type 2 diabetes and also cancer, in which chronic low-grade inflammation is a significant contributing factor.  Thus researchers suggested depression may be a neuropsychiatric manifestation of a chronic inflammatory syndrome. An increasing number of clinical studies have shown that treating gastrointestinal inflammation with probiotics, vitamin B, vitamin D, may also improve depression symptoms and quality of life by attenuating pro-inflammatory stimuli to your brain.  Research suggests the primary cause of inflammation may be dysfunction of the gut-brain axis.  Your gut is literally your second brain -- created from the identical tissue as your brain during gestation -- and contains higher levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is associated with mood control.  It's important to understand that your gut bacteria are an active and integrated part of serotonin regulation and actually produce more serotonin than your brain. Optimizing your gut flora is a key part of the equation to optimize your levels. If you consume loads of processed foods and sugars, your gut bacteria will be severely compromised because processed foods tend to decimate healthy microflora. This leaves a void that is filled by disease-causing bacteria and yeast and fungi that will promote inflammation and decrease the health of your second brain. Low-Sugar Diet Is an Important Anti-Depressant Tool   Besides distorting your microflora, sugar also triggers a cascade of other chemical reactions in your body known to promote both chronic inflammation and depression. For starters, excessive sugar consumption leads to elevated insulin levels. That can have a detrimental impact on your mood and mental health by causing higher levels of glutamate to be secreted in your brain, which has been linked to agitation, depression, anger, anxiety, and panic attacks.  Sugar suppresses activity of a key growth hormone called BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) which promotes healthy brain neurons. BDNF levels are critically low in both depression and schizophrenia, which animal models suggest might actually be causative.  Cultured and fermented foods, on the other hand, help reseed your gut with a wide variety of healthy bacteria that promote mental and physical health as long as your keep your sugar and processed food intake low. For instance, one 2011 study14 found that the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus has a marked effect on GABA levels in certain brain regions and lowers the stress-induced hormone corticosterone, resulting in reduced anxiety- and depression-related behavior. So the three-prong dietary answer for treating depression is to:  Severely limit sugars, especially fructose, as well as grains, as all forms of sugar feed pathogenic bacteria in your gut. The easiest way to do this is to avoid processed foods, and start cooking from scratch using whole ingredients. As a standard recommendation, I suggest limiting your daily fructose consumption from all sources to 25 grams per day or less.  Avoid foods with genetically engineered ingredients, as they too have been implicated in the destruction of gut flora, along with promoting chronic inflammation. Keep in mind that conventionally-grown foods may also be contaminated with glyphosate, which has been found to selectively destroy beneficial, health-promoting gut bacteria, so ideally, youll want to make sure as much of your food as possible is organically grown to avoid pesticide exposure.  Introduce fermented foods into your diet to rebalance your gut flora.  Beware that your gut bacteria are also very sensitive to and can be harmed by the following, all of which should be avoided:    Antibiotics, unless absolutely necessary (and when you do, make sure to reseed your gut with fermented foods and/or a probiotic supplement)  Conventionally-raised meats and other animal products, as CAFO animals are routinely fed low-dose antibiotics, plus genetically engineered grains  Chlorinated and/or fluoridated water  Antibacterial soap Vitamin D Deficiency Predisposes You to Depression  Vitamin D deficiency is another important biological factor that can play a significant role in mental health. In one 2006 study,15 seniors with vitamin D levels below 20 ng/ml were found to be 11 times more prone to be depressed than those with higher levels. Its worth noting that the mean vitamin D level was just under 19 ng/ml, which is a severe deficiency state. In fact, 58 percent of the participants had levels below 20 ng/ml. A 2007 study16 suggested that vitamin D deficiency is responsible for symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients with fibromyalgia. Vitamin D deficiency is also a well-recognized cause in Seasonal Affective Disorder17 (SAD). A double-blind randomized trial18 published in 2008 also concluded that:   It appears to be a relation between serum levels of 25(OH)D and symptoms of depression. Supplementation with high doses of vitamin D seems to ameliorate these symptoms indicating a possible causal relationship.  More recently, researchers19 found that seniors with depression had vitamin D levels that were 14 percent lower than those who were not depressed. Here, those with vitamin D levels below 20 ng/ml had an 85 percent increased risk of depression, compared to those with levels above 30 ng/ml. Yet another paper20 published in 2011 noted that:   Effective detection and treatment of inadequate vitamin D levels in persons with depression and other mental disorders may be an easy and cost-effective therapy which could improve patients long-term health outcomes as well as their quality of life. Based on the evaluation of healthy populations that get plenty of natural sun exposure, the optimal range for general physical and mental health appears to be somewhere between 50 and 70 ng/ml. So, if youre depressed, youd be well advised to get your vitamin D level checked, and to address any insufficiency or deficiency. The D*Action Project by GrassrootsHealth is one cost effective testing solution. As for optimizing your levels, sensible sun exposure is the ideal way. Alternatively, use a tanning bed with an electronic ballast, and/or an oral vitamin D3 supplement. GrassrootsHealth has a helpful chart showing the average adult dose required to reach healthy vitamin D levels based upon your measured starting point. Keep in mind that if you opt for a vitamin D supplement, you also need to take vitamin K2 and magnesium, as these nutrients work in tandem.   There Are Many Alternatives to Drug Treatment   Antidepressant drugs come with a long laundry list of risks, and are therefore best left as a last resort, if all else fails. Medical journalist and Pulitzer Prize nominee Robert Whitaker has detailed the many drawbacks and benefits of various treatments in his two books: Mad in America, and Anatomy of an Epidemic: Magic Bullets, Psychiatric Drugs, and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America, noting that physical exercise actually comes out on top in most studieseven when compared against antidepressant drugs.  Exercise primarily works by helping to normalize your insulin levels while simultaneously boosting feel good"" hormones in your brain. But researchers have also discovered that exercise allows your body to eliminate kynurenine, a harmful protein associated with depression.21 And, again showing the link between inflammation and depression, your body metabolizes kynurenine in the first place via a process that is activated by stress and inflammatory factors... While I addressed several dietary factors to restore health to your gut, I also recommend supplementing your diet with a high quality animal-based omega-3 fat, such as krill oil. This may be the single most important nutrient for optimal brain function, thereby easing symptoms of depression. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also contribute to depression, and affects one in four people.  Last but not least, make sure you get enough sleep. The link between depression and lack of sleep is well established. Of the approximately 18 million Americans with depression, more than half of them struggle with insomnia. While it was long thought that insomnia was a symptom of depression, it now seems that insomnia may precede depression in some cases.22 Recent research also found that sleep therapy resulted in remarkable improvements in depressed patients. The take-home message here is that one or more lifestyle factors may be at the heart of your depression, so youd be well advised to address the factors discussed in this article before resorting to drug treatmentwhich science has shown is no more effective than placebo, while being fraught with potentially dangerous side effects.

The Link Between Depression and Gastrointestinal Inflammation,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/10/06/can-inflammation-in-this-organ-be-at-the-root-of-your-depression.aspx,"Recent studies have shown that inflammation may be involved in the pathogenesis of depression. In fact, some research has demonstrated that depression is frequently associated with gastrointestinal inflammations and autoimmune diseases as well as with other ailments in which chronic low-grade inflammation is a significant contributing factor. It is possible that depression could be a neuropsychiatric manifestation of a chronic inflammatory syndrome. And the primary cause of inflammation may be the dysfunction of the ""gut-brain axis"". According to a study reprinted on the website Green Med Info: ""... [A]n increasing number of clinical studies have shown that treating gastrointestinal inflammations with probiotics, vitamin B, D and omega 3 fatty acids, through attenuating proinflammatory stimuli to brain, may also improve depression symptoms and quality of life. All these findings justify an assumption that treating gastrointestinal inflammations may improve the efficacy of the currently used treatment modalities of depression and related diseases."" By Dr. Mercola  The notion that inflammation in your gut could be linked to your symptoms of depression may sound far-fetched, but it actually makes perfect sense when you understand the intricate connection between your brain and your digestive tract. Perhaps the simplest example to use is getting butterflies in your stomach when you're nervous, thus your thoughts, i.e. brain, are manifesting symptoms in your gut. But another route of connection is via low-grade inflammation, which is a significant contributing factor to numerous diseases that often occur alongside depression, and may, in fact, be manifesting your depressive symptoms.  Is Depression the Result of Chronic Inflammation?  A recent review has pointed out several mechanisms by which gastrointestinal inflammation may play a critical role in the development of depression.  Among them:  Depression is often found alongside gastrointestinal inflammations and autoimmune diseases as well as with cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, type 2-diabetes and also cancer, in which chronic low-grade inflammation is a significant contributing factor. Thus researchers suggested ""depression may be a neuropsychiatric manifestation of a chronic inflammatory syndrome.""  Research suggests the primary cause of inflammation may be dysfunction of the ""gut-brain axis."" Your gut is literally your second brain -- created from the identical tissue as your brain during gestation -- and contains larger amounts of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is associated with mood control. It's important to understand that your gut bacteria are an active and integrated part of your body, and as such are heavily dependent on your diet and vulnerable to your lifestyle. If you consume a lot of processed foods and sweetened drinks, for instance, your gut bacteria are likely going to be severely compromised because processed foods in general will destroy healthy microflora and sugars of all kinds feed bad bacteria and yeast, as well as promote systemic inflammation. An increasing number of clinical studies have shown that treating gastrointestinal inflammation with probiotics, vitamin B, vitamin D and omega-3 fats may also improve depression symptoms and quality of life by attenuating proinflammatory stimuli to your brain.   What this all boils down to is that chronic inflammation in your body disrupts the normal functioning of many bodily systems, and can wreak havoc on your brain. But it appears inflammation may be more than just another risk factor for depression; it may in fact be THE risk factor that underlies all others. Although this refers to postpartum depression, the inflammatory response is the same in its impact on all forms of depression. Published in the International Breastfeeding Journal, researchers stated:  ""The old paradigm described inflammation as simply one of many risk factors for depression. The new paradigm is based on more recent research that has indicated that physical and psychological stressors increase inflammation. These recent studies constitute an important shift in the depression paradigm: inflammation is not simply a risk factor; it is the risk factor that underlies all the others. Moreover, inflammation explains why psychosocial, behavioral and physical risk factors increase the risk of depression. This is true for depression in general and for postpartum depression in particular. Puerperal women are especially vulnerable to these effects because their levels of proinflammatory cytokines significantly increase during the last trimester of pregnancy -- a time when they are also at high risk for depression.Moreover, common experiences of new motherhood, such as sleep disturbance, postpartum pain, and past or current psychological trauma, act as stressors that cause proinflammatory cytokine levels to rise.""  This is Why Sugar is Also a Major Factor in Depression  There's a great book on this subject, The Sugar Blues, written by William Duffy more than 35 years ago, that delves into the sugar-depression link in great detail. The central argument Duffy makes in the book is that sugar is an extremely health-harming addictive drug, and that simply making that one dietary change -- eliminating as much sugar as possible -- can have a profoundly beneficial impact on your mental health. He even advocated eliminating sugar from the diet of the mentally ill, stating it could be an effective treatment in and of itself for some people. It's become increasingly clear that one route by which sugar is so detrimental to your mental health is because sugar consumption triggers a cascade of chemical reactions in your body that promote chronic inflammation. Further, excess sugar and fructose will distort the ratio of good to bad bacteria in your gut, which also plays an integral role in your mental health. Sugar does this by serving as a fertilizer/fuel for pathogenic bacteria, yeast and fungi that negatively inhibit the beneficial bacteria in your gut. For instance, recent research showed the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus was found to have a marked effect on GABA levels in certain brain regions and lowered the stress-induced hormone corticosterone, resulting in reduced anxiety- and depression-related behavior. But if you consume a lot of processed foods and sweetened drinks (which are typically fructose-heavy), your gut bacteria are likely going to be severely compromised and so is your mental health! So the dietary answer for treating depression is to severely limit sugars, especially fructose, as well as grains.  It's worth noting that sugar can also lead to excessive insulin release that can lead to hypoglycemia, which, in turn, causes your brain to secrete glutamate in levels that can cause agitation, depression, anger, anxiety, panic attacks and an increase in suicide risk. So radically reducing your sugar intake, especially fructose, to less than 25 grams per day will be one of the most powerful interventions for dealing with depression, as well as fighting chronic inflammation and supporting healthy gut bacteria. Consuming more than 25 grams of fructose a day will clearly push your brain biochemistry, and your overall health, in the wrong direction.  Relieving Gastrointestinal Inflammation May Ease Your Depressive Symptoms  We discussed the importance of limiting sugar and fructose, which is one of the primary ways to treat gastrointestinal inflammation, above. You will also want to be sure your gut is regularly ""reseeded"" with good bacteria, or probiotics, which are the foundation of a healthy gastrointestinal tract. My recommendations for optimizing your gut bacteria are as follows:  Fermented foods are still the best route to optimal digestive health, as long as you eat the traditionally made, unpasteurized versions. Healthy choices include lassi (an Indian yoghurt drink, traditionally enjoyed before dinner), fermented raw (unpasteurrized) grass-fed organic milk such as kefir, various pickled fermentations of cabbage, turnips, eggplant, cucumbers, onions, squash and carrots, and natto (fermented soy). If you regularly eat fermented foods such as these that, again, have not been pasteurized (pasteurization kills the naturally occurring probiotics), your healthy gut bacteria will thrive. Probiotic supplement. Although I'm not a major proponent of taking many supplements (as I believe the majority of your nutrients need to come from food), probiotics aredefinitely anexception. I have used many different brands over the past 15 years and there are many good ones out there. If you do not eat fermented foods, taking a high-quality probiotic supplement certainly makes a lot of sense considering how important they are to optimizing your mental health.  Probiotics have a direct effect on brain chemistry, transmitting mood- and behavior-regulating signals to your brain via the vagus nerve, which is yet another reason why your intestinal health can have such a profound influence on your mental health, and vice versa. Two other important factors to treat gastrointestinal inflammation and also help relieve depression are:  Animal-based omega-3 fats: These not only regulate inflammatory processes and responses, but also positively influence outcome in depressive disorders. So if you are currently struggling with depression, taking a high-quality, animal-based omega-3 fat supplement like krill oil daily is a simple and smart choice.  Vitamin D: Most people are not aware that vitamin D deficiency is associated with inflammation and depression. One previous study found that people with the lowest levels of vitamin D were 11 times more prone to be depressed than those who had normal levels, so you will want to be sure your levels are in the healthy range by getting proper sun exposure or using a safe tanning bed. As a last resort, you can also take a high-quality vitamin D3 supplement, but make sure you have your levels monitored if you choose this route.   There's a wealth of evidence showing gastrointestinal involvement in a variety of neurological disease. With this in mind, it should also be crystal clear that nourishing your gut flora with good bacteria is extremely important, from cradle to old age, because in a very real sense you have two brains, one inside your skull and one in your gut, and each needs its own vital nourishment.

The Link Between Mental Illness and Hypothyroid Disease,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/06/19/mental-illness-hypothyroidism.aspx,"By Kelly Brogan, M.D.  Meet your mitochondria.1 With a laundry list of responsibilities ranging from creating energy to determining the time of a cell's death, mitochondria have increasingly become the focus of chronic disease research.2 The keeper of our mitochondria is our thyroid hormone.3 This is why, when thyroid hormone is deficient or poorly functioning, patients experience an array of symptoms, including fatigue, constipation, hair loss, depression, foggy thinking, cold body temperature, low metabolism, and muscle aches.  How much of what we call ""mental illness"" is actually thyroid-driven? In my experience, a vast majority, and certainly enough of a subset to warrant a more sophisticated appreciation for proper diagnosis and treatment in these patients.  To Reverse Pathology, You Need a Whole Mind-Body Approach  Thyroid health is so much more than pumping out a hormonal product  it is a sophisticated conversation between the brain, gland, hormones, and the receiving cells and tissues.  This circuitry is at the mercy of yet another hormone, cortisol,4 produced by your adrenal glands, signaled by your brain.  This is why hypothyroidism can also look like anxiety, palpitations, insomnia, and sweating, and why one person may feel restored on thyroid hormone and another decimated.  Once we ask about the state of adrenal function, we have to dig a step deeper and ask what is taxing the adrenals. From this point of inquiry, we are typically talking about gut, diet, and environmental immune provocation.  This is the model of medicine that prizes root-causes, considerations like gluten enteropathy, sugar imbalance, fluoride toxicity, and iodine deficiency as potential drivers of thyroid hypofunction. The many lifestyle and environmental factors that can influence this relationship are prime examples of the web-like, whole mind-body approach that medicine must take in an effort to truly reverse pathology. Underdiagnoses and Mistreatment   When patients are tested for thyroid pathology, typically at their own request, they are often confronted with ""reference range"" rejection  physicians staring at numbers instead of the suffering humans before them.  Reference ranges that bracket your lab results are based on unscreened and clinically unassessed populations (many were active hypothyroid patients), never calibrated for diagnostic practice. Doctors are trained to look at a brain hormone  TSH  as an absolute indicator of whether or not a patient is living in a glandular hormonal deficiency state.  Dysfunction of the endocrine system at large is totally ignored by this metric that ""diagnoses"" only the lowest 2.5 percent of those in a given reference range, as hypothyroid, without looking at the whole picture of their hormone activity. There is also neglect for the significance of antibodies as a relevant indicator of endocrine/immune dynamics, and consideration of autoimmune drivers. For those who do receive the label of hypothyroid, they remain obliquely objectified by their lab work as their doctors use synthetic T4  Synthroid  to attempt to move their TSH within range, more often leaving them symptomatic but ""treated"" because of poor conversion to active thyroid hormone (T3) and suppression of natural T3 production because of their now lower TSH.  When patients are denied appropriate hormonal treatment, it can be a slippery slope to medications for their remaining symptoms, and one category of medications in particular  psychiatric. The Psychiatric Slide   Psychiatry is often positioned to slap Band-Aids on the festering unwashed wounds of the population. When these patients are told that they are ""fine"" or ""treated"" but they continue to feel unwell, they are sent to a psychiatrist, or started on psychotropics by a nonspecialist. Are many psych patients actual thyroid patients?  The literature seems to suggest as much, particularly in pregnant women. An important premise, however, is that there is likely gross underdiagnosis taking place in the literature secondary to use of a single metric TSH. We will see the significance of thyroid autoantibodies in various psychiatric diagnosis.  This reflects what functional medicine and naturopathy have claimed for years  that immune dysregulation is the key factor in thyroid hypofunction, and may predate actual change in hormone production by up to seven years.5 The role of thyroid in brain health has been the subject of speculation for over a century. As noted in a 1949 paper in the British Medical Journal:6  ""[Since] 1888 the Committee of the Clinical society of London reported on the mental changes observed in over 100 cases of Myxoedema and noted the general retardation, sluggishness and slowness of apprehension, which was associated with insanity in the form of melancholia, chronic mania and dementia.""  Another study published in the journal Encephale7 in 2004 notes several actions of thyroid hormone on your brain:   ""Thyroid hormones receptors are predominantly present in cerebral cortex, amygdala, plexus choroideus and structures of adult neurogenesis: hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Thyroid hormones modify expression of genes encoding myelin, neurotrophins, and proteins involved in intracellular signaling pathways. They have also neuroprotective and vasodilatory effects.""   Dipping Hormones and Depression   In the case of depression, there is much dispute as to the significance of hypothyroidism in presentations of classical and treatment resistant cases. Estimates of ""subclinical hypothyroidism"" (where free hormones are low, but TSH is normal) are up to 52 percent in the resistant population,8 which is demonstrative of the importance of looking beyond TSH.  The specific suppression of free T3 levels in depressed patients has been evaluated in several studies including those which specifically identified poor conversion of T4 to T3 in depressed women who were less likely to improve with standard medication treatments.9, 10 In 10 years after initial hospital admission, those with evidence of thyroid dysfunction through a stimulation test (TRH) were significantly more likely to relapse.11 Antibodies to thyroid tissue are also present in 20 percent of depressed patients,12 as compared to 5-10 percent of the general population.  If All Else Fails, Add Some Thyroid   In both bipolar and unipolar depression, there have been six randomized, placebo-controlled trials conducted wherein thyroid hormone was used as an augmentation to an incompletely effective antidepressant (tricyclic) and found to be effective, particularly in women. In the STAR*D report,13 the largest and most expensive trial ever conducted on antidepressant treatments, T3 was found to result in remission in 24.7 percent of patients. Predicting Postpartum?   Perhaps the best studied population when it comes to the predictive role of thyroid abnormalities, pregnant and postpartum women deserve the most vigilant screening. Of 31 inpatient women with a diagnosis of postpartum psychosis,14 19 percent had detectable thyroid autoantibodies and 67 percent of these women developed thyroid dysfunction by six months as compared to 20 percent in the controls. TSH at delivery has been shown to be a predictor of postpartum depression at six months postpartum.15, 16, 17 Even in the setting of ""normal"" TSH levels, thyroid autoantibodies are predictive of postpartum depression and anger18, 19 including in prospective trials.20, 21 Risks of hypothyroidism include adverse pregnancy outcomes such as hemorrhage, preeclampsia, fetal cardiac rhythm anomalies, and labor abnormalities.22 Thyroid antibodies, once again, represent a significant risk factor, not just for psychiatric pathology but for tripled odds of miscarriage and double of preterm birth.23 Importantly, in one randomized, placebo-controlled trial,24 supplementation with 200 micrograms (mcg) of selenium during pregnancy reduced antibody activity and improved hormone parameters likely owing to selenium's antioxidant properties in thyroid tissue. Hypermania Hyperthyroid   In a recent review entitled ""Gender differences in thyroid system function: relevance to bipolar disorder and its treatment,""25 the authors discuss high prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in female bipolar patients with a focus on rapid cycling illness, resistant to treatment. Lithium, considered a gold-standard mood-stabilizer, interferes with thyroid hormone secretion, and may induce or unmask underlying pathology.  A randomized, placebo controlled trial26 of T4 treatment in bipolar depression showed improvement that was limited, statistically, by high rates of placebo response, and likely the same conversion limitations of using T4 as opposed to a T3 containing preparation. A rational extension of this finding was demonstrated in two studies that found elevated T3 in manic bipolar patients, one noting that patients with bipolar mania relative to controls were 2.55 times as likely to have abnormal free hormone levels.27, 28 Feeling like a mental patient? Look out for these offenders. The establishment of a relationship between suboptimal thyroid function and symptoms of mental illness tells us that appropriate and comprehensive screening is vital in this population. It also leads us to ask, why is the thyroid flagging, and what can we do about it. High on my list of causative offenders are:  Birth control pills:29 The synthetic hormones in this pharmaceutical product increase thyroid hormone binding globulin, effectively lowering available thyroid hormone even without perturbing lab values.   Gluten:30 In addition to its direct effects on the brain through opioid compounds, indirect effects through autoimmune and cytokine stimulation, gluten drives at least two pathologies  celiac and Hashimoto's  that are significantly associated with depression and other mental illnesses. The prevalence and causative role of gluten in Hashimoto's Disease (thyroid autoimmunity) has been established.31 The role of gluten in brain health is of increasing interest, and in celiac patients with thyroid autoantibodies, depression and panic disorder risk is greatly increased.32  Fluoride:33 Historically, fluoride was used, even in the milligram range, to suppress thyroid function in hyperthyroid patients. It interferes with multiple aspects of thyroid tissue integrity, hormone activation, and displacement of iodine, a critical and essential mineral for thyroid function.   Endocrine disruptors:34 From exposure in utero, 35 industrial and agricultural chemicals such as phthalates, flame retardants, and PCBs are pervasive toxicants that interfere with the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal signaling, stimulating the immune system and derailing hormones.  Summary of Recommendations   For all of the reasons listed above, my top recommendations for anyone experiencing symptoms of mood disturbance are to:  Clean up your local environment: from personal care products to cleaning agents, water, air, and electromagnetic fields Clean up your diet: eliminate gluten, dairy, GMOs (soy, corn, and vegetable oils), and sugar  Clean up your mind: initiate a meditation practice to heal your adrenals and promote anti-inflammatory signaling.   In my article, ""Thyroid Dysfunction and Treatment,"" I explore these interventions a bit further. The thyroid is a canary in the coalmine. In our fast-paced, technology-smothered, nutrient-depleted, and toxicant-replete lifestyles, your thyroid gland may be the first to come under siege. Recognize the profound significance of treating a thyroid condition with psychotropic medications, and choose to go to the root of the problem, first.

"How to Build a Healthy Microbiome, Before, During, & After Birth",http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/12/29/healthy-gut-microbiome.aspx,"By Kelly Brogan, MD   My patients are often surprised when I ask them where they were born and whether or not hospital walls and their mothers vaginal canal were key players in their emergence.  As someone who follows a burgeoning literature on the role of the microbiome in regulation of immunity, inflammatory response, and brain health, the formative role of the birth experience in later mental health is one I choose to shine my investigative light on.   Mental health and wellness are often, if not always, a reflection of bodily and physiologic balance  endocrine, gut, immune, neurochemical. Through this lens, allergic and autoimmune disorders, metabolic derailments, and cancer are all relevant indicators of the nature of this multifocal imbalance and the pathway to repair.  Pathologies such as obsessive-compulsive disorder1 can be seen as an inflammatory/immune/microbiome-based problem with a non-medication resolution (far from the hand-waving attribution of these symptoms to a serotonin imbalance).  Increasing evidence supports the primary role of the gut microbiome in influencing stress-response patterns, most notably cortisol production and regulation.2  The Rise of Epigenetics  When, with the completion of the Human Genome Project, we learned that we must have outsourced the vast majority of our human physiology to somewhere other than our 25,000 genes, we began to focus on epigenetics.  This is the bodys ability to manifest variable genetic expression within our epigenome without changes to the primary nucleotide sequences of our DNA itself, and this mechanism relies primarily on environmental cues, sometimes referred to as the exposome.  As our greatest interface with our environment, the gut houses the microflora, primarily bacteria that extend our genomic library 150 fold; it is home to the majority of our immune system,  The gut is also responsible for metabolizing food that we couldnt otherwise, for producing nutrients that we couldnt otherwise, and even for detoxing chemical exposures3 that we couldnt otherwise.  In short, the gut is arguably home base for health. But how do our guts get set up? What are the contributing factors to gut health? When does it start? Before Birth  Adding to a long list of oops! in the history of medicine, it was long-held that the womb was a sterile environment. We now have broadened our appreciation of the ubiquitous nature of microbes to encompass their special place in the placenta, umbilical cord, and fetal membranes.4  In this way, the pregnant, mother-to-bes long life of antibiotics, birth control, gluten, GMOs, chronic stress, and vaccination all conspire to set the stage for the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum passage of microbial information for gene expression.  This supports the vital importance of a detoxified pregnancy and a nutrient dense diet. I look to the tenets of Weston Price, and borrow from the principles of ancestral health which acknowledges the role of nutrient dense animal foods for fatty acid support, fat-soluble vitamins, choline, B vitamins, and zinc.  I recommend strict avoidance of gluten, sugar, pesticides, and genetically modified foods such as virtually all corn, soy, and vegetable oils on the market today.  During Birth  I am no longer interested in defending the safety of homebirth. Well-conducted meta-analyses have done this, such as those published in 2005 and 2013 in the British Medical Journal5 which found that those who gave birth at home had lower (by more than half) rates of severe, acute maternal morbidity, postpartum hemorrhage, and manual placenta removal.  These statistics, and the fear-mongering rhetoric around birth, are speaking around the primary issue: birth is not a medical problem to be managed. Women have allowed this most primal and transformative experience to be co-opted by a male-dominated paradigm of abusive interventionism.  In no way, should the burden of proof lie in defending how we have birthed for the entirety of our presence here on this planet. Birth is not about monitoring strips, pain, and apgar scores. It is an evolutionarily orchestrated dance in a womans mind and body that gives way to a mother-baby dyad, a unit that must be preserved, protected, and honored.  Is it possible that 1/3 of American women, now having surgical births, have lost the ability to birth as we evolved to do?  According to Dr. Stuart Fischbein,6 a homebirthing obstetrician, in one generation we have gone from birthing 99 percent of babies at home in 1920 to 99 percent of babies born in the hospital by 1950, and a C-section rate that has increased by 50 percent since 1996 with no improvement in neonatal mortality. A fascinating study entitled Cesarean delivery and hematopoietic stem cell epigenetics in the newborn infant: implications for future health?7 identified significant epigenetic changes induced by vaginal birth, that were apparent as global methylation differences and even specific DNA loci that seemed to correlate with labor duration and vaginal birth.  This means that vaginal birth influences gene expression in enduring cell lines in newborns  its an important part of the process! Beyond the unintended side effects of pain interventions, the interference with breastfeeding onset and potential risk for postpartum depression, a medicalized birth also disturbs and jeopardizes the health of the microbiome.  We know that babies born surgically are more likely to have gut colonization from non-mother skin flora than mothers gut,8, 9 but what about babies born vaginally in a hospital vs. at home? Vaginal Birth in Hospital versus HomeDoes It Make a Difference?  In a 2011 study in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,10 researchers attempted to answer this question. In a birth cohort, fecal samples were collected at one month of age, and blood samples at ages one and 6-7. The authors concluded that: Colonization by Clostridium difficile at age one month was associated with wheeze and eczema throughout the first 6 to 7 years of life and with asthma at age 6 to 7 years. Vaginal home delivery compared with vaginal hospital delivery was associated with a decreased risk of eczema, sensitization to food allergens, and asthma. In this analysis, they corroborated the non-maternal skin bacteria inheritance of the infants born surgically, and found that they were colonized by less beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacterium and bacteroides. They attribute differences in health outcomes in these children to the presence of a pathogenic species  Clostridium difficile. It is possible that there was an unappreciated influence from other related factors, what is referred to as healthy user bias, wherein those women birthing at home were more likely to engage in conscious health decisions, generally.  In this cohort, 491 of the recruited were in the alternative lifestyle group noted for child-rearing practices, dietary habits, restricted use of medication, and vaccination schemes, but we do know that there are fundamental differences in microbial colonization depending on place of delivery. A recent article also attempted to explain what we are doing wrong in the hospital, from a microbial perspective. With 99,000 deaths annually attributed to hospital acquired infection, all of the Purelling, efforts towards sterility, and employee protocols may be enabling these deadly pathogens to take hold. This is a prime example of how we need to look beyond the one-germ-exposure-equals-infection meme that has driven a multi-billion dollar vaccination program, reckless use of antibiotics, and personal disinfectants.  According to Environmental Health Perspectives:11 A new hypothesis says that hospital-acquired infections are being driven not by the existence of harmful microbes but by the absence of helpful species. It certainly appears that we may be setting the stage for lifelong obesity, asthma, allergy, and mental illness by neglecting the role of hospital-based microbial life and interference with maternal transfer of bacteria, in the birthing of our babies. Intrapartum Antibiotics: The GBS Heist  One of the specific perils of a medicalized pregnancy is the routine screening for a specific pathogen at 35-37 weeks  Group B Strep. Part of the commensal vaginal microbiome for a large majority of women, the belief has been cultivated that its presence is significant cause for harm. Because of the inability to predetermine what babies might be vulnerable to this infection when exposed, 68,966 women would be treated to prevent 1 neonatal death12  if, indeed, thats what antibiotics are capable of doing. According to the gold standard in objective evaluation of available research, the Cochrane Database:13  This review finds that giving antibiotics is not supported by conclusive evidence. The review identified four trials involving 852 GBS positive women. Very few of the women in labor who are GBS positive give birth to babies who are infected with GBS and antibiotics can have harmful effects such as severe maternal allergic reactions, increase in drug-resistant organisms and exposure of newborn infants to resistant bacteria, and postnatal maternal and neonatal yeast infections.   Additionally, a retrospective study in Pediatrics14 found that all of the infants with GBS infection were, in fact, administered intrapartum antibiotics. Of potentially greater concern is the increased risk of late-onset serious and drug-resistant bacterial infection conferred by intrapartum antibiotic exposure15 and the 40 percent increase in neonatal mortality (despite 68 percent decrease in GBS colonization) when infants are given antibiotic prophylaxis postpartum.16 Notably, if we are to regard GBS as a stand-alone risk factor, garlic and probiotics may be all thats needed to safely shift vaginal colonization.17, 18, 19 Perhaps universal screening without appreciation for other contributing risk factors for neonatal GBS infection, and mandatory IV antibiotics which are not only ineffective, but potentially threatening to a cultivated commensal microbiome, does not represent best practice. Then again, most obstetricians dont tend to concern themselves with evidence based medicine, let alone, supporting physiologic birth.  After Birth  Weve explored two parts of this tripartite microbial inheritance and the final means of educating a newborns immune system, inflammatory and cortisol response is breastfeeding. Breast milk is so much more than food. It is emblematic of food as information, as more than the sum of its caloric or micro/macronutrient parts. It contains immune factors, bacteria (termed entero-mammary transfer20), and over 200 unique oligosaccharides, designed to nourish gut bacteria, which are not replicable and conspicuously absent from each and every formula on the market. Recently, epigenetic modifiers as packets of immune-related information or exosomes have been discovered in breast milk,21 further revealing the hubris involved in assuming that we have decoded the elements of infant immunity and nutrition evolved over millions of years. Infants are born with an anti-inflammatory phenotype, designed to rely on maternal immunity for temporary genomic education and expression. Vaccine-induced antibody production and associated immune-stimulating toxic adjuvants have no place in this relationship, and are, in no way, a surrogate. Studies demonstrate that vaccine-induced antibodies are present in 49 percent of babies born to naturally immune mothers and 15 percent in vaccinated at 8 months.22, 23 Modern conceptualization of immunity and psychoneuroendocrinology has rendered archaic the simplified antibody-based paradigm of vaccinology.  We have come a long way from our roots as evidenced by studies examining the vastly different gut microbiomes of modern day hunter-gatherers and urban dwelling Italians. Given the now acknowledged estimate that 90 percent of our cells are bacterial in origin, it could be argued that we have forcibly evolved our species out of its natural manifestation  one defined by a coevolution within an ecosystem. Now, our very humanity, as largely defined by the microbial communities in and on us, has been permuted by exposures to medical interventions, pharmaceuticals, genetic modification, industrialization, poisoning of our food supply, and chronic stress. Healing from these transgressions will require that we start to recognize the sanctity of pregnancy, birth, and postpartum in establishing the bedrock for future mental and physical health of each child, and our childrens children.

How to Fight Depression Naturally,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/09/03/friendship-fights-depression.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Previous research shows that having a strong social network of good friends is a significant factor in longevity. If you're socially isolated, you may experience poor health and a shorter lifespan.   Friendships can also be a significant factor in successful recuperation from depression. According to recent research,1 good mood and a positive outlook can actually spread like a contagion through social groups.   Perhaps more importantly, this study refutes earlier claims that depression is ""contagious,"" finding instead that only positive moods tend to spread among people in close association.  Certainly, being depressed can have a dampening effect on the mood of those around you, but according to the authors, there's little risk of a depressed person actually pulling others into a state of clinical depression.  Friends Can Help Protect You from Depression   Data from more than 2,000 high school students was reviewed in this study. Over a period of six to 12 months, the students answered questions about symptoms of depression and who their friends were.   As reported by The Atlantic:2   ""Kids who initially scored as clinically depressed did not 'infect' their friends, but if they had enough friends who had what the study called a 'healthy mood'... that doubled their chances of recovering from their depression.   And for people who weren't depressed in the first place, having enough mentally healthy friends halved their chances of developing depression.  That's a pretty large effect, and supports previous research3 saying that high-quality social relationships lower people's risk of depression.""   According to the authors, when you find clusters of friends who are depressed, which other studies have found, this probably isn't due to one depressed individual pulling the others into the dumps with them.  Instead, it may be due to a third factor. Perhaps they're all heavy drinkers for example, or engaging in other activities that promote a negative mindset.  Co-author Thomas House claims their study method ""wasn't susceptible to that because we looked at direct changes of state. We were pretty much directly observing this process of your friend influencing you.    ""And the nice conclusion that we got was that your friends can protect you from depression and help you recover from it.""     The Inflammatory Roots of Depression   As important as friendships can be, they will probably not solve depression rooted in poor diet and lifestyle habits.   It's important to realize that, contrary to popular belief, depression is not likely caused by unbalanced brain chemicals; however there are a number of other biological factors that appear to be highly significant.   Chronic inflammation is one such factor.4   For example, researchers have found that melancholic depression, bipolar disorder, and postpartum depression are associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in combination with decreased cortisol sensitivity (cortisol is both a stress hormone and a buffer against inflammation).5 Scientists have also found that your mental health can be adversely impacted by factors such as vitamin D deficiency and/or unbalanced gut flora  both of which, incidentally, play a role in keeping inflammation in check, which is really what the remedy to depression is all about. Sugar, found in ample supply in most processed foods, is among the most pro-inflammatory ingredients there are, so the first step would be to replace processed foods with real, whole foods (ideally organic to avoid harmful pesticides and other detrimental ingredients).   Besides promoting chronic inflammation, refined sugar can exert a toxic effect by contributing to insulin and leptin resistance and impaired signaling, which play a significant role in your mental health.   Sugar also suppresses activity of a key growth hormone called BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) which promotes healthy brain neurons. BDNF levels are critically low in both depression and schizophrenia, which animal models suggest might actually be causative.  Sugar also facilitates the growth of pathogenic microbes in your gut and causes an imbalance of your microbiome that will also contribute to depression through a wide variety of mechanisms.   What to Do if Someone You Know Is Depressed  Perhaps one of the most helpful things you can do if you have a friend or family member that struggles with depression is to help guide them toward healthier eating and lifestyle habits, as making changes can be particularly difficult when you're feeling blue  or worse, suicidal. If you are feeling desperate or have any thoughts of suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a toll-free number: 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or call 911, or simply go to your nearest Hospital Emergency Department. You can't make long-term plans for lifestyle changes when you are in a crisis.  One Boy's Sadness Turns Into a Smile Campaign     On the topic of friendship, this CBS report features a young boy with remarkable emotional resilience and capacity to reach out in friendship to others despite his own pain. By the time he was 6 years old, Jaden Hayes had lost both parents. While heartbroken, he was still determined to live with joy, and one day he told his aunt and guardian he was ""sick and tired of seeing everyone so sad all the time.""   He wanted to turn people's frowns into smiles. And so began this young boy's ""smile campaign."" Since that day, he and his aunt have handed out about 500 toys  small rubber duckies, dinosaurs, etc.  just to make people smile, who weren't. His goal, he says, is to make 33,000 people smile; a goal he may well have reached already through this news report.   Jaden is proof positive that going through a rough time in life does not automatically doom you to depression and despair. You have a choice in how you deal with your situation. And while some seem to have a ""hardier"" emotional constitution than others, happiness is often a choice that we make.   That said, your lifestyle can wield great influence over your emotional and mental state, so it would be unreasonable to say a depressed person should simply ""snap out of it"" and ""turn their frown upside-down."" I believe most cases of depression are rooted in an unhealthy diet and subsequent gut dysfunction and/or nutritional deficiencies, with vitamin D and omega-3 being two very significant ones, in terms of their effect on mental health.   The Importance of Omega-3    Healthy fats play a particularly important role in depression. Without healthy fats, your brain function may be adversely affected, and one potential side effect is depression, as well as more serious psychiatric disorders. Healthy fats include saturated fats like avocados, butter made from raw grass-fed organic milk, raw dairy, organic pastured egg yolks, coconuts and coconut oil, unheated organic nut oils, raw nuts, and grass-fed meats.  You'll want to make sure you're getting plenty of these types of fat in your diet. Beyond that, animal-based omega-3 fat, found in fish and krill oil, may be the single most important nutrient to battle depression. It's particularly important when combating more serious problems such as psychosis and schizophrenia.  In one recent study,6,7,8,9 taking an omega-3 supplement for three months substantially reduced the risk of developing a psychotic disorder in the future. Eighty-one individuals considered at risk for developing schizophrenia or psychosis took part in the randomized, double blind trial.  Half of them got a daily course of fish oil for 12 weeks while the other half received a placebo. After the intervention period, all participants were monitored for one full year.   Seventy-six of the 81 participants completed the study, and only two of the 41 people who took fish oil went on to develop a psychotic disorder during the follow-up period. In the placebo group, 11 of the 40 participants developed psychosis. Interestingly, seven years later, only four from the original treatment group had developed a psychotic disorder compared to a total of 16 in the placebo group, suggesting even short-term omega-3 supplementation can have long lasting effects.   Eating Real Food May Be Key for Successful Treatment of Depression   The evidence clearly indicates that your diet plays a key role in your mental health, for better or worse. So if you're struggling with depression, mood swings, or feel yourself sliding into ""the blues,"" I strongly advise you to look at what you're eating. The key is to eat real food, ideally organic (to avoid chemical exposures) and locally grown (for maximum freshness).   Also make sure to eat plenty of traditionally cultured and fermented foods, which will help nourish beneficial bacteria in your gut. Good examples include fermented vegetables of all kinds, including sauerkraut and kimchi, kombucha (a fermented drink), as well as fiber-rich prebiotic foods like jicama (Mexican yam).   Optimizing your gut flora appears to be absolutely crucial for good mental health, which is understandable when you consider that gut bacteria actually manufacture neurochemicals such as dopamine and serotonin, along with vitamins that are important for brain health. In fact, you have a greater concentration of serotonin in your gut than in your brain.  I recommend eating REAL food and avoiding all types of processed foods, including certified organic ones, as processed foods are no longer ""alive."" What you're looking for is whole, unadulterated foods, with which to cook from scratch (or eat raw). Processed foods are simply loaded with ingredients known to alter your gut flora and promote inflammation, thereby inviting depression. This includes: Added sugar and high fructose corn syrup Genetically engineered (GE) ingredients (primarily corn, soy, and sugar beets) which, besides their own unknown health risks, also tend to be heavily contaminated with glyphosate  a Class 2A carcinogen that can also damage your gut microbiome and has been linked to antibiotic-resistance. Most conventional (non-GE) wheat is also treated with toxic glyphosate prior to harvesting.  By altering the balance of your gut flora, pesticides and herbicides also disrupt the production of essential amino acids like tryptophan, a serotonin precursor, and promote production of p-cresol, a compound that interferes with metabolism of other environmental chemicals, thereby increasing your vulnerability to their toxic effects. Artificial sweeteners, along with thousands of food additives, most of which have never been tested for safety Chemicals in the food packaging, such as bisphenol-A (BPA), bisphenol-S (BPS), and phthalates, which can migrate into the food Trans fats, which can harm your memory among other things   It is possible to fight depression with a good, can-do mindset coupled with positive changes to your diet, all of which can help you start on the path to effortless healing and taking control of your health.

What Is Postpartum Depression and What Causes It?,http://articles.mercola.com/depression/postpartum-depression.aspx,"Giving birth is a joyful and exciting experience for most mothers. After months of waiting and anticipating, there's nothing more fulfilling than finally holding your newborn in your arms.    But unfortunately, not all moms feel like this. In fact, some generally feel overwhelmed and become prone to the ""baby blues""  an emotional reaction wherein the mother feels anxious, weepy, irritable, moody and unable to sleep.1  Usually, baby blues go away after two week or less. But in some mothers, these emotions do not go away and intensify instead. They often become more severe and long-lasting, resulting in extreme sadness, difficulty bonding with their baby and even having thoughts of death and suicide.    When this happens, this is no longer a simple case of baby blues  it's already postpartum depression.  What Is Postpartum Depression and What Causes It?   As its name implies, postpartum depression (also called postnatal depression) is a mood disorder that can affect a mother after giving birth.2 It's a common problem that's believed to affect more than 1 in every 10 women within the first year after childbirth. Postpartum depression may also affect fathers and partners, but this is rare.3   Experts haven't determined one single cause for postpartum depression; however, it's speculated to come from a combination of emotional and physical factors. One possible cause is the fluctuating hormones due to pregnancy.    After a woman gives birth, the levels of hormones (estrogen and progesterone in particular) in her body drop quickly. As a result, chemical changes occur in her brain, triggering mood swings.    Another cause is the lack of time to fully recover from childbirth. Mothers are often sleep deprived as they try to accommodate their newborn's needs, leading to exhaustion and physical discomfort, which then contribute to postnatal depression symptoms.4   Mothers who suffer from postpartum depression usually exhibit different behaviors. Postpartum Progress has a comprehensive list of symptoms,5 such as:      Feeling overwhelmed and/or guilty    Not bonding with the baby    Being irritated, angry or moody    Extreme sadness and hopelessness    Lack of appetite    Inability to sleep and concentrate    Feeling disconnected from the rest of the world     Although rare, some mothers develop more severe symptoms when dealing with depression. They lose interest in their newborn child, and/or think about (or even attempt) hurting themselves and/or their baby. Some develop hallucinations and may even have suicidal thoughts.6  How Long Does Postpartum Depression Last?  Aside from being more severe than baby blues in terms of symptoms, postpartum depression actually lasts longer. It can begin any time after childbirth, from a few days or weeks after the baby is born up to six months after delivery. If left untreated, this disorder can last for many months or even longer, interfering with the mother's ability to care for the child or do other chores and tasks.7  Try These Natural Postpartum Depression Remedies  While many conventional healthcare practitioners will immediately recommend antidepressants as your primary postpartum depression treatment method, remember that these drugs may do more harm than good. Some antidepressants are also ill-advised especially if you're breastfeeding.8  Instead, try these natural methods to get rid of this disorder:    Increase your omega-3 intake. A study has shown that insufficient dietary intake of omega-3s may increase a woman's risk of postpartum depression.9 You can get omega-3s from foods like wild Alaskan salmon, small fish like sardines and anchovies, and flax seeds and chia seeds. Supplementing with high-quality krill oil is also recommended.10  Get vitamin B2. It may decrease your risk of this type of depression if consumed in moderation.11  Herbs and supplements. These may help treat depression in general (and postpartum depression in particular), however, you may need to consult with your physician if these are safe to take, especially if you're breastfeeding. For example, St. John's wort has mixed evidence regarding its safety when taken while breastfeeding.   Additionally, make sure to evaluate your lifestyle and determine how you can limit or reduce your stress, so you will be able to better recover from this disorder. Here are a few tips to remember:12      Connect with your partner, friends and family. Let them know that you need their guidance and support. Don't hesitate to ask for help, especially for caring for your baby, if you truly need it.    Accept help from others. Consider if you need to hire extra help to do tasks like cooking, housework and shopping, so that you can spend more time and bond with your baby.    Make time for yourself. Allot time for relaxing and enjoyable activities. Meditate, go for a walk, take a warm bath, listen to music or read a book.    Rest whenever you can. Sleep if you get the chance. Take ""shifts"" with your partner, so that you can get enough shuteye.    Exercise regularly. It helps boost people's mood.    Nourish yourself with regular, healthy meals made from wholesome organic foods. Avoid processed foods and don't go for long periods without having a snack.    Avoid substances like alcohol or recreational drugs, which can only make you feel worse.

Advances in Understanding of Depression Offer New Hope,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/01/22/depression-causes.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Depression is thought to affect about one in 10 Americans.1 In 2010, antidepressants were the second most commonly prescribed type of medication in the US,2 hinting at the severity of the problem. Contrary to popular belief, depression is not likely caused by unbalanced brain chemicals; however there are a number of other biological factors that appear to be highly significant. Chronic inflammation is one. As noted in the featured article:3  George Slavich, a clinical psychologist at the University of California in Los Angeles, has spent years studying depression, and has come to the conclusion that it has as much to do with the body as the mind.  I dont even talk about it as a psychiatric condition anymore, he says. It does involve psychology, but it also involves equal parts of biology and physical health. The basis of this new view is blindingly obvious once it is pointed out: everyone feels miserable when they are ill. That feeling of being too tired, bored and fed up to move off the sofa and get on with life is known among psychologists as sickness behaviour.  It happens for a good reason, helping us avoid doing more damage or spreading an infection any further. It also looks a lot like depression.  One researcher even goes so far as to suggest depression should be rebranded as an infectious but non-contagious disease,4 while the author of the featured article playfully compares depression with an allergic reactionin this case an allergy to modern lifeconsidering the many environmental factors that are known to cause inflammation, from diet to toxic exposures and stress. Scientists have also found that your mental health can be adversely impacted by factors such as vitamin D deficiency and/or unbalanced gut floraboth of which, incidentally, play a role in keeping inflammation in check, which is really what the remedy to depression is all about. Inflammation and Depression  As discussed in an article by Dr Brogan, depressive symptoms can be viewed as downstream manifestations of inflammation.   The source itself may be singularly or multiply-focused as stress, dietary and toxic exposures, and infection... [I]nflammation appears to be a highly relevant determinant of depressive symptoms such as flat mood, slowed thinking, avoidance, alterations in perception, and metabolic changes,5 she writes. Certain biomarkers, such as cytokines in your blood and inflammatory messengers like CRP, IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-alpha, show promise as potential new diagnostic tools, as theyre predictive6 and linearly7 correlative with depression.  For example, researchers have found8 that melancholic depression, bipolar disorder, and postpartum depression, are associated with elevated levels of cytokines in combination with decreased cortisol sensitivity (cortisol is both a stress hormone and a buffer against inflammation). As explained by Dr. Brogan:  Once triggered in the body, these inflammatory agents transfer information to the nervous system, typically through stimulation of major nerves such as the vagus, which connects9 the gut and brain. Specialized cells called microglia in the brain represent the brains immune hubs and are activated in inflammatory states.  In activated microglia, an enzyme called IDO (indoleamine 2 3-dioxygenase) has been shown10 to direct tryptophan away from the production of serotonin and melatonin and towards the production of an NMDA agonist called quinolinic acid that may be responsible for symptoms of anxiety and agitation.  These are just some of the changes that may conspire to let your brain in on what your body may know is wrong. Using Brain Scans to Help Choose Treatment Type  Speaking of biomarkers, research11 by Dr. Helen Mayberg, a professor of psychiatry at Emory University, may also pave the way toward a more refined and customized treatment plan. Her research is discussed in the video above.  Dr. Mayberg has identified a biomarker in the brain that can be used to predict whether a depressed patient is a good candidate for medication, or might be better off with psychotherapy. As noted by the New York Times:12  Patients who had low activity in a brain region called the anterior insula measured before treatment responded quite well to cognitive behavior therapy (CBT} but poorly to Lexapro; conversely, those with high activity in this region had an excellent response to Lexapro, but did poorly with CBT....  [T]he insula is centrally involved in the capacity for emotional self-awareness, cognitive control and decision making, all of which are impaired by depression. Perhaps cognitive behavior therapy has a more powerful effect than an antidepressant in patients with an underactive insula because it teaches patients to control their emotionally disturbing thoughts in a way that an antidepressant cannot. The Links Between Gut and Mental Health  A number of studies have confirmed that gastrointestinal inflammation specifically can play a critical role in the development of depression, suggesting that beneficial bacteria (probiotics) may be an important part of treatment. For example, a Hungarian scientific review13 published in 2011 made the following observations:  Depression is often found alongside gastrointestinal inflammations and autoimmune diseases as well as with cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, type 2 diabetes and also cancer, in which chronic low-grade inflammation is a significant contributing factor.  Thus researchers suggested depression may be a neuropsychiatric manifestation of a chronic inflammatory syndrome. An increasing number of clinical studies have shown that treating gastrointestinal inflammation with probiotics, vitamin B, vitamin D, may also improve depression symptoms and quality of life by attenuating pro-inflammatory stimuli to your brain.  Research suggests the primary cause of inflammation may be dysfunction of the gut-brain axis.  Your gut is literally your second brain -- created from the identical tissue as your brain during gestation -- and contains higher levels of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is associated with mood control.  It's important to understand that your gut bacteria are an active and integrated part of serotonin regulation and actually produce more serotonin than your brain. Optimizing your gut flora is a key part of the equation to optimize your levels. If you consume loads of processed foods and sugars, your gut bacteria will be severely compromised because processed foods tend to decimate healthy microflora. This leaves a void that is filled by disease-causing bacteria and yeast and fungi that will promote inflammation and decrease the health of your second brain. Low-Sugar Diet Is an Important Anti-Depressant Tool   Besides distorting your microflora, sugar also triggers a cascade of other chemical reactions in your body known to promote both chronic inflammation and depression. For starters, excessive sugar consumption leads to elevated insulin levels. That can have a detrimental impact on your mood and mental health by causing higher levels of glutamate to be secreted in your brain, which has been linked to agitation, depression, anger, anxiety, and panic attacks.  Sugar suppresses activity of a key growth hormone called BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) which promotes healthy brain neurons. BDNF levels are critically low in both depression and schizophrenia, which animal models suggest might actually be causative.  Cultured and fermented foods, on the other hand, help reseed your gut with a wide variety of healthy bacteria that promote mental and physical health as long as your keep your sugar and processed food intake low. For instance, one 2011 study14 found that the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus has a marked effect on GABA levels in certain brain regions and lowers the stress-induced hormone corticosterone, resulting in reduced anxiety- and depression-related behavior. So the three-prong dietary answer for treating depression is to:  Severely limit sugars, especially fructose, as well as grains, as all forms of sugar feed pathogenic bacteria in your gut. The easiest way to do this is to avoid processed foods, and start cooking from scratch using whole ingredients. As a standard recommendation, I suggest limiting your daily fructose consumption from all sources to 25 grams per day or less.  Avoid foods with genetically engineered ingredients, as they too have been implicated in the destruction of gut flora, along with promoting chronic inflammation. Keep in mind that conventionally-grown foods may also be contaminated with glyphosate, which has been found to selectively destroy beneficial, health-promoting gut bacteria, so ideally, youll want to make sure as much of your food as possible is organically grown to avoid pesticide exposure.  Introduce fermented foods into your diet to rebalance your gut flora.  Beware that your gut bacteria are also very sensitive to and can be harmed by the following, all of which should be avoided:    Antibiotics, unless absolutely necessary (and when you do, make sure to reseed your gut with fermented foods and/or a probiotic supplement)  Conventionally-raised meats and other animal products, as CAFO animals are routinely fed low-dose antibiotics, plus genetically engineered grains  Chlorinated and/or fluoridated water  Antibacterial soap Vitamin D Deficiency Predisposes You to Depression  Vitamin D deficiency is another important biological factor that can play a significant role in mental health. In one 2006 study,15 seniors with vitamin D levels below 20 ng/ml were found to be 11 times more prone to be depressed than those with higher levels. Its worth noting that the mean vitamin D level was just under 19 ng/ml, which is a severe deficiency state. In fact, 58 percent of the participants had levels below 20 ng/ml. A 2007 study16 suggested that vitamin D deficiency is responsible for symptoms of depression and anxiety in patients with fibromyalgia. Vitamin D deficiency is also a well-recognized cause in Seasonal Affective Disorder17 (SAD). A double-blind randomized trial18 published in 2008 also concluded that:   It appears to be a relation between serum levels of 25(OH)D and symptoms of depression. Supplementation with high doses of vitamin D seems to ameliorate these symptoms indicating a possible causal relationship.  More recently, researchers19 found that seniors with depression had vitamin D levels that were 14 percent lower than those who were not depressed. Here, those with vitamin D levels below 20 ng/ml had an 85 percent increased risk of depression, compared to those with levels above 30 ng/ml. Yet another paper20 published in 2011 noted that:   Effective detection and treatment of inadequate vitamin D levels in persons with depression and other mental disorders may be an easy and cost-effective therapy which could improve patients long-term health outcomes as well as their quality of life. Based on the evaluation of healthy populations that get plenty of natural sun exposure, the optimal range for general physical and mental health appears to be somewhere between 50 and 70 ng/ml. So, if youre depressed, youd be well advised to get your vitamin D level checked, and to address any insufficiency or deficiency. The D*Action Project by GrassrootsHealth is one cost effective testing solution. As for optimizing your levels, sensible sun exposure is the ideal way. Alternatively, use a tanning bed with an electronic ballast, and/or an oral vitamin D3 supplement. GrassrootsHealth has a helpful chart showing the average adult dose required to reach healthy vitamin D levels based upon your measured starting point. Keep in mind that if you opt for a vitamin D supplement, you also need to take vitamin K2 and magnesium, as these nutrients work in tandem.   There Are Many Alternatives to Drug Treatment   Antidepressant drugs come with a long laundry list of risks, and are therefore best left as a last resort, if all else fails. Medical journalist and Pulitzer Prize nominee Robert Whitaker has detailed the many drawbacks and benefits of various treatments in his two books: Mad in America, and Anatomy of an Epidemic: Magic Bullets, Psychiatric Drugs, and the Astonishing Rise of Mental Illness in America, noting that physical exercise actually comes out on top in most studieseven when compared against antidepressant drugs.  Exercise primarily works by helping to normalize your insulin levels while simultaneously boosting feel good"" hormones in your brain. But researchers have also discovered that exercise allows your body to eliminate kynurenine, a harmful protein associated with depression.21 And, again showing the link between inflammation and depression, your body metabolizes kynurenine in the first place via a process that is activated by stress and inflammatory factors... While I addressed several dietary factors to restore health to your gut, I also recommend supplementing your diet with a high quality animal-based omega-3 fat, such as krill oil. This may be the single most important nutrient for optimal brain function, thereby easing symptoms of depression. Vitamin B12 deficiency can also contribute to depression, and affects one in four people.  Last but not least, make sure you get enough sleep. The link between depression and lack of sleep is well established. Of the approximately 18 million Americans with depression, more than half of them struggle with insomnia. While it was long thought that insomnia was a symptom of depression, it now seems that insomnia may precede depression in some cases.22 Recent research also found that sleep therapy resulted in remarkable improvements in depressed patients. The take-home message here is that one or more lifestyle factors may be at the heart of your depression, so youd be well advised to address the factors discussed in this article before resorting to drug treatmentwhich science has shown is no more effective than placebo, while being fraught with potentially dangerous side effects.

The Link Between Depression and Gastrointestinal Inflammation,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/10/06/can-inflammation-in-this-organ-be-at-the-root-of-your-depression.aspx,"Recent studies have shown that inflammation may be involved in the pathogenesis of depression. In fact, some research has demonstrated that depression is frequently associated with gastrointestinal inflammations and autoimmune diseases as well as with other ailments in which chronic low-grade inflammation is a significant contributing factor. It is possible that depression could be a neuropsychiatric manifestation of a chronic inflammatory syndrome. And the primary cause of inflammation may be the dysfunction of the ""gut-brain axis"". According to a study reprinted on the website Green Med Info: ""... [A]n increasing number of clinical studies have shown that treating gastrointestinal inflammations with probiotics, vitamin B, D and omega 3 fatty acids, through attenuating proinflammatory stimuli to brain, may also improve depression symptoms and quality of life. All these findings justify an assumption that treating gastrointestinal inflammations may improve the efficacy of the currently used treatment modalities of depression and related diseases."" By Dr. Mercola  The notion that inflammation in your gut could be linked to your symptoms of depression may sound far-fetched, but it actually makes perfect sense when you understand the intricate connection between your brain and your digestive tract. Perhaps the simplest example to use is getting butterflies in your stomach when you're nervous, thus your thoughts, i.e. brain, are manifesting symptoms in your gut. But another route of connection is via low-grade inflammation, which is a significant contributing factor to numerous diseases that often occur alongside depression, and may, in fact, be manifesting your depressive symptoms.  Is Depression the Result of Chronic Inflammation?  A recent review has pointed out several mechanisms by which gastrointestinal inflammation may play a critical role in the development of depression.  Among them:  Depression is often found alongside gastrointestinal inflammations and autoimmune diseases as well as with cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, type 2-diabetes and also cancer, in which chronic low-grade inflammation is a significant contributing factor. Thus researchers suggested ""depression may be a neuropsychiatric manifestation of a chronic inflammatory syndrome.""  Research suggests the primary cause of inflammation may be dysfunction of the ""gut-brain axis."" Your gut is literally your second brain -- created from the identical tissue as your brain during gestation -- and contains larger amounts of the neurotransmitter serotonin, which is associated with mood control. It's important to understand that your gut bacteria are an active and integrated part of your body, and as such are heavily dependent on your diet and vulnerable to your lifestyle. If you consume a lot of processed foods and sweetened drinks, for instance, your gut bacteria are likely going to be severely compromised because processed foods in general will destroy healthy microflora and sugars of all kinds feed bad bacteria and yeast, as well as promote systemic inflammation. An increasing number of clinical studies have shown that treating gastrointestinal inflammation with probiotics, vitamin B, vitamin D and omega-3 fats may also improve depression symptoms and quality of life by attenuating proinflammatory stimuli to your brain.   What this all boils down to is that chronic inflammation in your body disrupts the normal functioning of many bodily systems, and can wreak havoc on your brain. But it appears inflammation may be more than just another risk factor for depression; it may in fact be THE risk factor that underlies all others. Although this refers to postpartum depression, the inflammatory response is the same in its impact on all forms of depression. Published in the International Breastfeeding Journal, researchers stated:  ""The old paradigm described inflammation as simply one of many risk factors for depression. The new paradigm is based on more recent research that has indicated that physical and psychological stressors increase inflammation. These recent studies constitute an important shift in the depression paradigm: inflammation is not simply a risk factor; it is the risk factor that underlies all the others. Moreover, inflammation explains why psychosocial, behavioral and physical risk factors increase the risk of depression. This is true for depression in general and for postpartum depression in particular. Puerperal women are especially vulnerable to these effects because their levels of proinflammatory cytokines significantly increase during the last trimester of pregnancy -- a time when they are also at high risk for depression.Moreover, common experiences of new motherhood, such as sleep disturbance, postpartum pain, and past or current psychological trauma, act as stressors that cause proinflammatory cytokine levels to rise.""  This is Why Sugar is Also a Major Factor in Depression  There's a great book on this subject, The Sugar Blues, written by William Duffy more than 35 years ago, that delves into the sugar-depression link in great detail. The central argument Duffy makes in the book is that sugar is an extremely health-harming addictive drug, and that simply making that one dietary change -- eliminating as much sugar as possible -- can have a profoundly beneficial impact on your mental health. He even advocated eliminating sugar from the diet of the mentally ill, stating it could be an effective treatment in and of itself for some people. It's become increasingly clear that one route by which sugar is so detrimental to your mental health is because sugar consumption triggers a cascade of chemical reactions in your body that promote chronic inflammation. Further, excess sugar and fructose will distort the ratio of good to bad bacteria in your gut, which also plays an integral role in your mental health. Sugar does this by serving as a fertilizer/fuel for pathogenic bacteria, yeast and fungi that negatively inhibit the beneficial bacteria in your gut. For instance, recent research showed the probiotic Lactobacillus rhamnosus was found to have a marked effect on GABA levels in certain brain regions and lowered the stress-induced hormone corticosterone, resulting in reduced anxiety- and depression-related behavior. But if you consume a lot of processed foods and sweetened drinks (which are typically fructose-heavy), your gut bacteria are likely going to be severely compromised and so is your mental health! So the dietary answer for treating depression is to severely limit sugars, especially fructose, as well as grains.  It's worth noting that sugar can also lead to excessive insulin release that can lead to hypoglycemia, which, in turn, causes your brain to secrete glutamate in levels that can cause agitation, depression, anger, anxiety, panic attacks and an increase in suicide risk. So radically reducing your sugar intake, especially fructose, to less than 25 grams per day will be one of the most powerful interventions for dealing with depression, as well as fighting chronic inflammation and supporting healthy gut bacteria. Consuming more than 25 grams of fructose a day will clearly push your brain biochemistry, and your overall health, in the wrong direction.  Relieving Gastrointestinal Inflammation May Ease Your Depressive Symptoms  We discussed the importance of limiting sugar and fructose, which is one of the primary ways to treat gastrointestinal inflammation, above. You will also want to be sure your gut is regularly ""reseeded"" with good bacteria, or probiotics, which are the foundation of a healthy gastrointestinal tract. My recommendations for optimizing your gut bacteria are as follows:  Fermented foods are still the best route to optimal digestive health, as long as you eat the traditionally made, unpasteurized versions. Healthy choices include lassi (an Indian yoghurt drink, traditionally enjoyed before dinner), fermented raw (unpasteurrized) grass-fed organic milk such as kefir, various pickled fermentations of cabbage, turnips, eggplant, cucumbers, onions, squash and carrots, and natto (fermented soy). If you regularly eat fermented foods such as these that, again, have not been pasteurized (pasteurization kills the naturally occurring probiotics), your healthy gut bacteria will thrive. Probiotic supplement. Although I'm not a major proponent of taking many supplements (as I believe the majority of your nutrients need to come from food), probiotics aredefinitely anexception. I have used many different brands over the past 15 years and there are many good ones out there. If you do not eat fermented foods, taking a high-quality probiotic supplement certainly makes a lot of sense considering how important they are to optimizing your mental health.  Probiotics have a direct effect on brain chemistry, transmitting mood- and behavior-regulating signals to your brain via the vagus nerve, which is yet another reason why your intestinal health can have such a profound influence on your mental health, and vice versa. Two other important factors to treat gastrointestinal inflammation and also help relieve depression are:  Animal-based omega-3 fats: These not only regulate inflammatory processes and responses, but also positively influence outcome in depressive disorders. So if you are currently struggling with depression, taking a high-quality, animal-based omega-3 fat supplement like krill oil daily is a simple and smart choice.  Vitamin D: Most people are not aware that vitamin D deficiency is associated with inflammation and depression. One previous study found that people with the lowest levels of vitamin D were 11 times more prone to be depressed than those who had normal levels, so you will want to be sure your levels are in the healthy range by getting proper sun exposure or using a safe tanning bed. As a last resort, you can also take a high-quality vitamin D3 supplement, but make sure you have your levels monitored if you choose this route.   There's a wealth of evidence showing gastrointestinal involvement in a variety of neurological disease. With this in mind, it should also be crystal clear that nourishing your gut flora with good bacteria is extremely important, from cradle to old age, because in a very real sense you have two brains, one inside your skull and one in your gut, and each needs its own vital nourishment.

The Link Between Mental Illness and Hypothyroid Disease,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/06/19/mental-illness-hypothyroidism.aspx,"By Kelly Brogan, M.D.  Meet your mitochondria.1 With a laundry list of responsibilities ranging from creating energy to determining the time of a cell's death, mitochondria have increasingly become the focus of chronic disease research.2 The keeper of our mitochondria is our thyroid hormone.3 This is why, when thyroid hormone is deficient or poorly functioning, patients experience an array of symptoms, including fatigue, constipation, hair loss, depression, foggy thinking, cold body temperature, low metabolism, and muscle aches.  How much of what we call ""mental illness"" is actually thyroid-driven? In my experience, a vast majority, and certainly enough of a subset to warrant a more sophisticated appreciation for proper diagnosis and treatment in these patients.  To Reverse Pathology, You Need a Whole Mind-Body Approach  Thyroid health is so much more than pumping out a hormonal product  it is a sophisticated conversation between the brain, gland, hormones, and the receiving cells and tissues.  This circuitry is at the mercy of yet another hormone, cortisol,4 produced by your adrenal glands, signaled by your brain.  This is why hypothyroidism can also look like anxiety, palpitations, insomnia, and sweating, and why one person may feel restored on thyroid hormone and another decimated.  Once we ask about the state of adrenal function, we have to dig a step deeper and ask what is taxing the adrenals. From this point of inquiry, we are typically talking about gut, diet, and environmental immune provocation.  This is the model of medicine that prizes root-causes, considerations like gluten enteropathy, sugar imbalance, fluoride toxicity, and iodine deficiency as potential drivers of thyroid hypofunction. The many lifestyle and environmental factors that can influence this relationship are prime examples of the web-like, whole mind-body approach that medicine must take in an effort to truly reverse pathology. Underdiagnoses and Mistreatment   When patients are tested for thyroid pathology, typically at their own request, they are often confronted with ""reference range"" rejection  physicians staring at numbers instead of the suffering humans before them.  Reference ranges that bracket your lab results are based on unscreened and clinically unassessed populations (many were active hypothyroid patients), never calibrated for diagnostic practice. Doctors are trained to look at a brain hormone  TSH  as an absolute indicator of whether or not a patient is living in a glandular hormonal deficiency state.  Dysfunction of the endocrine system at large is totally ignored by this metric that ""diagnoses"" only the lowest 2.5 percent of those in a given reference range, as hypothyroid, without looking at the whole picture of their hormone activity. There is also neglect for the significance of antibodies as a relevant indicator of endocrine/immune dynamics, and consideration of autoimmune drivers. For those who do receive the label of hypothyroid, they remain obliquely objectified by their lab work as their doctors use synthetic T4  Synthroid  to attempt to move their TSH within range, more often leaving them symptomatic but ""treated"" because of poor conversion to active thyroid hormone (T3) and suppression of natural T3 production because of their now lower TSH.  When patients are denied appropriate hormonal treatment, it can be a slippery slope to medications for their remaining symptoms, and one category of medications in particular  psychiatric. The Psychiatric Slide   Psychiatry is often positioned to slap Band-Aids on the festering unwashed wounds of the population. When these patients are told that they are ""fine"" or ""treated"" but they continue to feel unwell, they are sent to a psychiatrist, or started on psychotropics by a nonspecialist. Are many psych patients actual thyroid patients?  The literature seems to suggest as much, particularly in pregnant women. An important premise, however, is that there is likely gross underdiagnosis taking place in the literature secondary to use of a single metric TSH. We will see the significance of thyroid autoantibodies in various psychiatric diagnosis.  This reflects what functional medicine and naturopathy have claimed for years  that immune dysregulation is the key factor in thyroid hypofunction, and may predate actual change in hormone production by up to seven years.5 The role of thyroid in brain health has been the subject of speculation for over a century. As noted in a 1949 paper in the British Medical Journal:6  ""[Since] 1888 the Committee of the Clinical society of London reported on the mental changes observed in over 100 cases of Myxoedema and noted the general retardation, sluggishness and slowness of apprehension, which was associated with insanity in the form of melancholia, chronic mania and dementia.""  Another study published in the journal Encephale7 in 2004 notes several actions of thyroid hormone on your brain:   ""Thyroid hormones receptors are predominantly present in cerebral cortex, amygdala, plexus choroideus and structures of adult neurogenesis: hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Thyroid hormones modify expression of genes encoding myelin, neurotrophins, and proteins involved in intracellular signaling pathways. They have also neuroprotective and vasodilatory effects.""   Dipping Hormones and Depression   In the case of depression, there is much dispute as to the significance of hypothyroidism in presentations of classical and treatment resistant cases. Estimates of ""subclinical hypothyroidism"" (where free hormones are low, but TSH is normal) are up to 52 percent in the resistant population,8 which is demonstrative of the importance of looking beyond TSH.  The specific suppression of free T3 levels in depressed patients has been evaluated in several studies including those which specifically identified poor conversion of T4 to T3 in depressed women who were less likely to improve with standard medication treatments.9, 10 In 10 years after initial hospital admission, those with evidence of thyroid dysfunction through a stimulation test (TRH) were significantly more likely to relapse.11 Antibodies to thyroid tissue are also present in 20 percent of depressed patients,12 as compared to 5-10 percent of the general population.  If All Else Fails, Add Some Thyroid   In both bipolar and unipolar depression, there have been six randomized, placebo-controlled trials conducted wherein thyroid hormone was used as an augmentation to an incompletely effective antidepressant (tricyclic) and found to be effective, particularly in women. In the STAR*D report,13 the largest and most expensive trial ever conducted on antidepressant treatments, T3 was found to result in remission in 24.7 percent of patients. Predicting Postpartum?   Perhaps the best studied population when it comes to the predictive role of thyroid abnormalities, pregnant and postpartum women deserve the most vigilant screening. Of 31 inpatient women with a diagnosis of postpartum psychosis,14 19 percent had detectable thyroid autoantibodies and 67 percent of these women developed thyroid dysfunction by six months as compared to 20 percent in the controls. TSH at delivery has been shown to be a predictor of postpartum depression at six months postpartum.15, 16, 17 Even in the setting of ""normal"" TSH levels, thyroid autoantibodies are predictive of postpartum depression and anger18, 19 including in prospective trials.20, 21 Risks of hypothyroidism include adverse pregnancy outcomes such as hemorrhage, preeclampsia, fetal cardiac rhythm anomalies, and labor abnormalities.22 Thyroid antibodies, once again, represent a significant risk factor, not just for psychiatric pathology but for tripled odds of miscarriage and double of preterm birth.23 Importantly, in one randomized, placebo-controlled trial,24 supplementation with 200 micrograms (mcg) of selenium during pregnancy reduced antibody activity and improved hormone parameters likely owing to selenium's antioxidant properties in thyroid tissue. Hypermania Hyperthyroid   In a recent review entitled ""Gender differences in thyroid system function: relevance to bipolar disorder and its treatment,""25 the authors discuss high prevalence of subclinical hypothyroidism in female bipolar patients with a focus on rapid cycling illness, resistant to treatment. Lithium, considered a gold-standard mood-stabilizer, interferes with thyroid hormone secretion, and may induce or unmask underlying pathology.  A randomized, placebo controlled trial26 of T4 treatment in bipolar depression showed improvement that was limited, statistically, by high rates of placebo response, and likely the same conversion limitations of using T4 as opposed to a T3 containing preparation. A rational extension of this finding was demonstrated in two studies that found elevated T3 in manic bipolar patients, one noting that patients with bipolar mania relative to controls were 2.55 times as likely to have abnormal free hormone levels.27, 28 Feeling like a mental patient? Look out for these offenders. The establishment of a relationship between suboptimal thyroid function and symptoms of mental illness tells us that appropriate and comprehensive screening is vital in this population. It also leads us to ask, why is the thyroid flagging, and what can we do about it. High on my list of causative offenders are:  Birth control pills:29 The synthetic hormones in this pharmaceutical product increase thyroid hormone binding globulin, effectively lowering available thyroid hormone even without perturbing lab values.   Gluten:30 In addition to its direct effects on the brain through opioid compounds, indirect effects through autoimmune and cytokine stimulation, gluten drives at least two pathologies  celiac and Hashimoto's  that are significantly associated with depression and other mental illnesses. The prevalence and causative role of gluten in Hashimoto's Disease (thyroid autoimmunity) has been established.31 The role of gluten in brain health is of increasing interest, and in celiac patients with thyroid autoantibodies, depression and panic disorder risk is greatly increased.32  Fluoride:33 Historically, fluoride was used, even in the milligram range, to suppress thyroid function in hyperthyroid patients. It interferes with multiple aspects of thyroid tissue integrity, hormone activation, and displacement of iodine, a critical and essential mineral for thyroid function.   Endocrine disruptors:34 From exposure in utero, 35 industrial and agricultural chemicals such as phthalates, flame retardants, and PCBs are pervasive toxicants that interfere with the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal signaling, stimulating the immune system and derailing hormones.  Summary of Recommendations   For all of the reasons listed above, my top recommendations for anyone experiencing symptoms of mood disturbance are to:  Clean up your local environment: from personal care products to cleaning agents, water, air, and electromagnetic fields Clean up your diet: eliminate gluten, dairy, GMOs (soy, corn, and vegetable oils), and sugar  Clean up your mind: initiate a meditation practice to heal your adrenals and promote anti-inflammatory signaling.   In my article, ""Thyroid Dysfunction and Treatment,"" I explore these interventions a bit further. The thyroid is a canary in the coalmine. In our fast-paced, technology-smothered, nutrient-depleted, and toxicant-replete lifestyles, your thyroid gland may be the first to come under siege. Recognize the profound significance of treating a thyroid condition with psychotropic medications, and choose to go to the root of the problem, first.

"How to Build a Healthy Microbiome, Before, During, & After Birth",http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/12/29/healthy-gut-microbiome.aspx,"By Kelly Brogan, MD   My patients are often surprised when I ask them where they were born and whether or not hospital walls and their mothers vaginal canal were key players in their emergence.  As someone who follows a burgeoning literature on the role of the microbiome in regulation of immunity, inflammatory response, and brain health, the formative role of the birth experience in later mental health is one I choose to shine my investigative light on.   Mental health and wellness are often, if not always, a reflection of bodily and physiologic balance  endocrine, gut, immune, neurochemical. Through this lens, allergic and autoimmune disorders, metabolic derailments, and cancer are all relevant indicators of the nature of this multifocal imbalance and the pathway to repair.  Pathologies such as obsessive-compulsive disorder1 can be seen as an inflammatory/immune/microbiome-based problem with a non-medication resolution (far from the hand-waving attribution of these symptoms to a serotonin imbalance).  Increasing evidence supports the primary role of the gut microbiome in influencing stress-response patterns, most notably cortisol production and regulation.2  The Rise of Epigenetics  When, with the completion of the Human Genome Project, we learned that we must have outsourced the vast majority of our human physiology to somewhere other than our 25,000 genes, we began to focus on epigenetics.  This is the bodys ability to manifest variable genetic expression within our epigenome without changes to the primary nucleotide sequences of our DNA itself, and this mechanism relies primarily on environmental cues, sometimes referred to as the exposome.  As our greatest interface with our environment, the gut houses the microflora, primarily bacteria that extend our genomic library 150 fold; it is home to the majority of our immune system,  The gut is also responsible for metabolizing food that we couldnt otherwise, for producing nutrients that we couldnt otherwise, and even for detoxing chemical exposures3 that we couldnt otherwise.  In short, the gut is arguably home base for health. But how do our guts get set up? What are the contributing factors to gut health? When does it start? Before Birth  Adding to a long list of oops! in the history of medicine, it was long-held that the womb was a sterile environment. We now have broadened our appreciation of the ubiquitous nature of microbes to encompass their special place in the placenta, umbilical cord, and fetal membranes.4  In this way, the pregnant, mother-to-bes long life of antibiotics, birth control, gluten, GMOs, chronic stress, and vaccination all conspire to set the stage for the antepartum, intrapartum, and postpartum passage of microbial information for gene expression.  This supports the vital importance of a detoxified pregnancy and a nutrient dense diet. I look to the tenets of Weston Price, and borrow from the principles of ancestral health which acknowledges the role of nutrient dense animal foods for fatty acid support, fat-soluble vitamins, choline, B vitamins, and zinc.  I recommend strict avoidance of gluten, sugar, pesticides, and genetically modified foods such as virtually all corn, soy, and vegetable oils on the market today.  During Birth  I am no longer interested in defending the safety of homebirth. Well-conducted meta-analyses have done this, such as those published in 2005 and 2013 in the British Medical Journal5 which found that those who gave birth at home had lower (by more than half) rates of severe, acute maternal morbidity, postpartum hemorrhage, and manual placenta removal.  These statistics, and the fear-mongering rhetoric around birth, are speaking around the primary issue: birth is not a medical problem to be managed. Women have allowed this most primal and transformative experience to be co-opted by a male-dominated paradigm of abusive interventionism.  In no way, should the burden of proof lie in defending how we have birthed for the entirety of our presence here on this planet. Birth is not about monitoring strips, pain, and apgar scores. It is an evolutionarily orchestrated dance in a womans mind and body that gives way to a mother-baby dyad, a unit that must be preserved, protected, and honored.  Is it possible that 1/3 of American women, now having surgical births, have lost the ability to birth as we evolved to do?  According to Dr. Stuart Fischbein,6 a homebirthing obstetrician, in one generation we have gone from birthing 99 percent of babies at home in 1920 to 99 percent of babies born in the hospital by 1950, and a C-section rate that has increased by 50 percent since 1996 with no improvement in neonatal mortality. A fascinating study entitled Cesarean delivery and hematopoietic stem cell epigenetics in the newborn infant: implications for future health?7 identified significant epigenetic changes induced by vaginal birth, that were apparent as global methylation differences and even specific DNA loci that seemed to correlate with labor duration and vaginal birth.  This means that vaginal birth influences gene expression in enduring cell lines in newborns  its an important part of the process! Beyond the unintended side effects of pain interventions, the interference with breastfeeding onset and potential risk for postpartum depression, a medicalized birth also disturbs and jeopardizes the health of the microbiome.  We know that babies born surgically are more likely to have gut colonization from non-mother skin flora than mothers gut,8, 9 but what about babies born vaginally in a hospital vs. at home? Vaginal Birth in Hospital versus HomeDoes It Make a Difference?  In a 2011 study in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology,10 researchers attempted to answer this question. In a birth cohort, fecal samples were collected at one month of age, and blood samples at ages one and 6-7. The authors concluded that: Colonization by Clostridium difficile at age one month was associated with wheeze and eczema throughout the first 6 to 7 years of life and with asthma at age 6 to 7 years. Vaginal home delivery compared with vaginal hospital delivery was associated with a decreased risk of eczema, sensitization to food allergens, and asthma. In this analysis, they corroborated the non-maternal skin bacteria inheritance of the infants born surgically, and found that they were colonized by less beneficial bacteria such as bifidobacterium and bacteroides. They attribute differences in health outcomes in these children to the presence of a pathogenic species  Clostridium difficile. It is possible that there was an unappreciated influence from other related factors, what is referred to as healthy user bias, wherein those women birthing at home were more likely to engage in conscious health decisions, generally.  In this cohort, 491 of the recruited were in the alternative lifestyle group noted for child-rearing practices, dietary habits, restricted use of medication, and vaccination schemes, but we do know that there are fundamental differences in microbial colonization depending on place of delivery. A recent article also attempted to explain what we are doing wrong in the hospital, from a microbial perspective. With 99,000 deaths annually attributed to hospital acquired infection, all of the Purelling, efforts towards sterility, and employee protocols may be enabling these deadly pathogens to take hold. This is a prime example of how we need to look beyond the one-germ-exposure-equals-infection meme that has driven a multi-billion dollar vaccination program, reckless use of antibiotics, and personal disinfectants.  According to Environmental Health Perspectives:11 A new hypothesis says that hospital-acquired infections are being driven not by the existence of harmful microbes but by the absence of helpful species. It certainly appears that we may be setting the stage for lifelong obesity, asthma, allergy, and mental illness by neglecting the role of hospital-based microbial life and interference with maternal transfer of bacteria, in the birthing of our babies. Intrapartum Antibiotics: The GBS Heist  One of the specific perils of a medicalized pregnancy is the routine screening for a specific pathogen at 35-37 weeks  Group B Strep. Part of the commensal vaginal microbiome for a large majority of women, the belief has been cultivated that its presence is significant cause for harm. Because of the inability to predetermine what babies might be vulnerable to this infection when exposed, 68,966 women would be treated to prevent 1 neonatal death12  if, indeed, thats what antibiotics are capable of doing. According to the gold standard in objective evaluation of available research, the Cochrane Database:13  This review finds that giving antibiotics is not supported by conclusive evidence. The review identified four trials involving 852 GBS positive women. Very few of the women in labor who are GBS positive give birth to babies who are infected with GBS and antibiotics can have harmful effects such as severe maternal allergic reactions, increase in drug-resistant organisms and exposure of newborn infants to resistant bacteria, and postnatal maternal and neonatal yeast infections.   Additionally, a retrospective study in Pediatrics14 found that all of the infants with GBS infection were, in fact, administered intrapartum antibiotics. Of potentially greater concern is the increased risk of late-onset serious and drug-resistant bacterial infection conferred by intrapartum antibiotic exposure15 and the 40 percent increase in neonatal mortality (despite 68 percent decrease in GBS colonization) when infants are given antibiotic prophylaxis postpartum.16 Notably, if we are to regard GBS as a stand-alone risk factor, garlic and probiotics may be all thats needed to safely shift vaginal colonization.17, 18, 19 Perhaps universal screening without appreciation for other contributing risk factors for neonatal GBS infection, and mandatory IV antibiotics which are not only ineffective, but potentially threatening to a cultivated commensal microbiome, does not represent best practice. Then again, most obstetricians dont tend to concern themselves with evidence based medicine, let alone, supporting physiologic birth.  After Birth  Weve explored two parts of this tripartite microbial inheritance and the final means of educating a newborns immune system, inflammatory and cortisol response is breastfeeding. Breast milk is so much more than food. It is emblematic of food as information, as more than the sum of its caloric or micro/macronutrient parts. It contains immune factors, bacteria (termed entero-mammary transfer20), and over 200 unique oligosaccharides, designed to nourish gut bacteria, which are not replicable and conspicuously absent from each and every formula on the market. Recently, epigenetic modifiers as packets of immune-related information or exosomes have been discovered in breast milk,21 further revealing the hubris involved in assuming that we have decoded the elements of infant immunity and nutrition evolved over millions of years. Infants are born with an anti-inflammatory phenotype, designed to rely on maternal immunity for temporary genomic education and expression. Vaccine-induced antibody production and associated immune-stimulating toxic adjuvants have no place in this relationship, and are, in no way, a surrogate. Studies demonstrate that vaccine-induced antibodies are present in 49 percent of babies born to naturally immune mothers and 15 percent in vaccinated at 8 months.22, 23 Modern conceptualization of immunity and psychoneuroendocrinology has rendered archaic the simplified antibody-based paradigm of vaccinology.  We have come a long way from our roots as evidenced by studies examining the vastly different gut microbiomes of modern day hunter-gatherers and urban dwelling Italians. Given the now acknowledged estimate that 90 percent of our cells are bacterial in origin, it could be argued that we have forcibly evolved our species out of its natural manifestation  one defined by a coevolution within an ecosystem. Now, our very humanity, as largely defined by the microbial communities in and on us, has been permuted by exposures to medical interventions, pharmaceuticals, genetic modification, industrialization, poisoning of our food supply, and chronic stress. Healing from these transgressions will require that we start to recognize the sanctity of pregnancy, birth, and postpartum in establishing the bedrock for future mental and physical health of each child, and our childrens children.

How to Fight Depression Naturally,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/09/03/friendship-fights-depression.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  Previous research shows that having a strong social network of good friends is a significant factor in longevity. If you're socially isolated, you may experience poor health and a shorter lifespan.   Friendships can also be a significant factor in successful recuperation from depression. According to recent research,1 good mood and a positive outlook can actually spread like a contagion through social groups.   Perhaps more importantly, this study refutes earlier claims that depression is ""contagious,"" finding instead that only positive moods tend to spread among people in close association.  Certainly, being depressed can have a dampening effect on the mood of those around you, but according to the authors, there's little risk of a depressed person actually pulling others into a state of clinical depression.  Friends Can Help Protect You from Depression   Data from more than 2,000 high school students was reviewed in this study. Over a period of six to 12 months, the students answered questions about symptoms of depression and who their friends were.   As reported by The Atlantic:2   ""Kids who initially scored as clinically depressed did not 'infect' their friends, but if they had enough friends who had what the study called a 'healthy mood'... that doubled their chances of recovering from their depression.   And for people who weren't depressed in the first place, having enough mentally healthy friends halved their chances of developing depression.  That's a pretty large effect, and supports previous research3 saying that high-quality social relationships lower people's risk of depression.""   According to the authors, when you find clusters of friends who are depressed, which other studies have found, this probably isn't due to one depressed individual pulling the others into the dumps with them.  Instead, it may be due to a third factor. Perhaps they're all heavy drinkers for example, or engaging in other activities that promote a negative mindset.  Co-author Thomas House claims their study method ""wasn't susceptible to that because we looked at direct changes of state. We were pretty much directly observing this process of your friend influencing you.    ""And the nice conclusion that we got was that your friends can protect you from depression and help you recover from it.""     The Inflammatory Roots of Depression   As important as friendships can be, they will probably not solve depression rooted in poor diet and lifestyle habits.   It's important to realize that, contrary to popular belief, depression is not likely caused by unbalanced brain chemicals; however there are a number of other biological factors that appear to be highly significant.   Chronic inflammation is one such factor.4   For example, researchers have found that melancholic depression, bipolar disorder, and postpartum depression are associated with elevated levels of inflammatory cytokines in combination with decreased cortisol sensitivity (cortisol is both a stress hormone and a buffer against inflammation).5 Scientists have also found that your mental health can be adversely impacted by factors such as vitamin D deficiency and/or unbalanced gut flora  both of which, incidentally, play a role in keeping inflammation in check, which is really what the remedy to depression is all about. Sugar, found in ample supply in most processed foods, is among the most pro-inflammatory ingredients there are, so the first step would be to replace processed foods with real, whole foods (ideally organic to avoid harmful pesticides and other detrimental ingredients).   Besides promoting chronic inflammation, refined sugar can exert a toxic effect by contributing to insulin and leptin resistance and impaired signaling, which play a significant role in your mental health.   Sugar also suppresses activity of a key growth hormone called BDNF (brain derived neurotrophic factor) which promotes healthy brain neurons. BDNF levels are critically low in both depression and schizophrenia, which animal models suggest might actually be causative.  Sugar also facilitates the growth of pathogenic microbes in your gut and causes an imbalance of your microbiome that will also contribute to depression through a wide variety of mechanisms.   What to Do if Someone You Know Is Depressed  Perhaps one of the most helpful things you can do if you have a friend or family member that struggles with depression is to help guide them toward healthier eating and lifestyle habits, as making changes can be particularly difficult when you're feeling blue  or worse, suicidal. If you are feeling desperate or have any thoughts of suicide, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, a toll-free number: 1-800-273-TALK (8255), or call 911, or simply go to your nearest Hospital Emergency Department. You can't make long-term plans for lifestyle changes when you are in a crisis.  One Boy's Sadness Turns Into a Smile Campaign     On the topic of friendship, this CBS report features a young boy with remarkable emotional resilience and capacity to reach out in friendship to others despite his own pain. By the time he was 6 years old, Jaden Hayes had lost both parents. While heartbroken, he was still determined to live with joy, and one day he told his aunt and guardian he was ""sick and tired of seeing everyone so sad all the time.""   He wanted to turn people's frowns into smiles. And so began this young boy's ""smile campaign."" Since that day, he and his aunt have handed out about 500 toys  small rubber duckies, dinosaurs, etc.  just to make people smile, who weren't. His goal, he says, is to make 33,000 people smile; a goal he may well have reached already through this news report.   Jaden is proof positive that going through a rough time in life does not automatically doom you to depression and despair. You have a choice in how you deal with your situation. And while some seem to have a ""hardier"" emotional constitution than others, happiness is often a choice that we make.   That said, your lifestyle can wield great influence over your emotional and mental state, so it would be unreasonable to say a depressed person should simply ""snap out of it"" and ""turn their frown upside-down."" I believe most cases of depression are rooted in an unhealthy diet and subsequent gut dysfunction and/or nutritional deficiencies, with vitamin D and omega-3 being two very significant ones, in terms of their effect on mental health.   The Importance of Omega-3    Healthy fats play a particularly important role in depression. Without healthy fats, your brain function may be adversely affected, and one potential side effect is depression, as well as more serious psychiatric disorders. Healthy fats include saturated fats like avocados, butter made from raw grass-fed organic milk, raw dairy, organic pastured egg yolks, coconuts and coconut oil, unheated organic nut oils, raw nuts, and grass-fed meats.  You'll want to make sure you're getting plenty of these types of fat in your diet. Beyond that, animal-based omega-3 fat, found in fish and krill oil, may be the single most important nutrient to battle depression. It's particularly important when combating more serious problems such as psychosis and schizophrenia.  In one recent study,6,7,8,9 taking an omega-3 supplement for three months substantially reduced the risk of developing a psychotic disorder in the future. Eighty-one individuals considered at risk for developing schizophrenia or psychosis took part in the randomized, double blind trial.  Half of them got a daily course of fish oil for 12 weeks while the other half received a placebo. After the intervention period, all participants were monitored for one full year.   Seventy-six of the 81 participants completed the study, and only two of the 41 people who took fish oil went on to develop a psychotic disorder during the follow-up period. In the placebo group, 11 of the 40 participants developed psychosis. Interestingly, seven years later, only four from the original treatment group had developed a psychotic disorder compared to a total of 16 in the placebo group, suggesting even short-term omega-3 supplementation can have long lasting effects.   Eating Real Food May Be Key for Successful Treatment of Depression   The evidence clearly indicates that your diet plays a key role in your mental health, for better or worse. So if you're struggling with depression, mood swings, or feel yourself sliding into ""the blues,"" I strongly advise you to look at what you're eating. The key is to eat real food, ideally organic (to avoid chemical exposures) and locally grown (for maximum freshness).   Also make sure to eat plenty of traditionally cultured and fermented foods, which will help nourish beneficial bacteria in your gut. Good examples include fermented vegetables of all kinds, including sauerkraut and kimchi, kombucha (a fermented drink), as well as fiber-rich prebiotic foods like jicama (Mexican yam).   Optimizing your gut flora appears to be absolutely crucial for good mental health, which is understandable when you consider that gut bacteria actually manufacture neurochemicals such as dopamine and serotonin, along with vitamins that are important for brain health. In fact, you have a greater concentration of serotonin in your gut than in your brain.  I recommend eating REAL food and avoiding all types of processed foods, including certified organic ones, as processed foods are no longer ""alive."" What you're looking for is whole, unadulterated foods, with which to cook from scratch (or eat raw). Processed foods are simply loaded with ingredients known to alter your gut flora and promote inflammation, thereby inviting depression. This includes: Added sugar and high fructose corn syrup Genetically engineered (GE) ingredients (primarily corn, soy, and sugar beets) which, besides their own unknown health risks, also tend to be heavily contaminated with glyphosate  a Class 2A carcinogen that can also damage your gut microbiome and has been linked to antibiotic-resistance. Most conventional (non-GE) wheat is also treated with toxic glyphosate prior to harvesting.  By altering the balance of your gut flora, pesticides and herbicides also disrupt the production of essential amino acids like tryptophan, a serotonin precursor, and promote production of p-cresol, a compound that interferes with metabolism of other environmental chemicals, thereby increasing your vulnerability to their toxic effects. Artificial sweeteners, along with thousands of food additives, most of which have never been tested for safety Chemicals in the food packaging, such as bisphenol-A (BPA), bisphenol-S (BPS), and phthalates, which can migrate into the food Trans fats, which can harm your memory among other things   It is possible to fight depression with a good, can-do mindset coupled with positive changes to your diet, all of which can help you start on the path to effortless healing and taking control of your health.

How to Deal with Endometriosis When You Are Pregnant,http://articles.mercola.com/endometriosis/pregnancy.aspx,"It is said that endometriosis typically affects between 3 to 10 percent of women of reproductive age, usually between the ages of 30 and 40, or virtually any woman with menstrual periods.1,2 Unfortunately, pregnant women may also experience endometriosis, although it can be said that its less painful compared to an ordinary womans struggle with the condition. Endometriosis is known to relapse while youre pregnant because of the hormonal environment that prevents the condition from becoming too stressful. However, endometriosis may come back during post-pregnancy.3 A pregnant woman with endometriosis is considered to be a high-risk case because the condition could be life-threatening for the mother and child. Why so? Dr. Lucky Saraswat, a gynecologist consultant from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the U.K., explains:4 We believe such changes in the pelvic and uterine environment could influence implantation and development of placenta, predisposing them to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Saraswat is also the first author of a nationwide cohort study that took place in Scotland, wherein the discharge data from all state hospitals was investigated, resulting in an analysis of the health records of 14,655 women.5 These Risks Are Common in Pregnant Women With Endometriosis Although a definite link between pregnancy and endometriosis has yet to be formally announced, there are studies, such as this Scotland study, that  shows that endometriosis increases the risk of a pregnant woman and her child to these conditions:6,7,8     Preterm birth: a woman has a greater risk of delivering her baby earlier compared to a woman without endometriosis. The results from the Scotland study showed that women with a history of endometriosis and had pregnancies that progressed beyond 24 weeks displayed a higher than average risk for preterm birth.    Ectopic pregnancy:9  during an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg implants itself in an area other than the main cavity of the uterus, usually on the fallopian tubes or on the cervix. An odd ratio of 2.7 was recorded when the Scotland study researchers compared the reproductive and pregnancy outcomes of 5,375 women with endometriosis and 8,280 women without endometriosis  with both groups of women being pregnant at the same time and after age and previous pregnancy rates were adjusted.    Caesarean delivery: women with endometriosis may be more likely to deliver their babies via a caesarean section.    Pre-eclampsia: usually occurring among women who are in their second and third trimesters, pre-eclampsia leads to high blood pressure levels.    Antepartum hemorrhage: this is the bleeding that takes place during the second half of the pregnancy. Just like in preterm birth, a womans risk for antepartum hemorrhage shoots up if she is suffering from endometriosis and if her pregnancy has progressed beyond 24 weeks. In numerous cases, however, the cause of bleeding is still unknown, but it could be initiated by placental abruption or placenta previa. Placental abruption occurs when the placenta separates from the inner wall of the uterus, either partially or completely, prior to delivery.10 Meanwhile, placenta previa happens when the babys placenta is partially or completely covering the opening in the mothers cervix.11   Miscarriage: defined as the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks, there are some studies that have highlighted endometriosis link with spontaneous abortion, but other studies have still not found any definite link. For miscarriage, an odds ratio of 1.76 was established in the Scotland study.   Stillbirth: a stillbirth is the loss of a pregnancy after 20 weeks. While the connection between endometriosis and stillbirth is yet to be established, some studies have found evidence between these two. Nevertheless, the main cause of stillbirth is still unknown.     < Previous Endometriosis Treatment Next > Endometriosis vs Adenomyosis   Previous Endometriosis Treatment   Next Endometriosis vs Adenomyosis [+] Sources and References      1Endometriosis, UCLA Obstetrics and Gynecology2Endometriosis, WomensHealth.gov3Endometriosis, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 20124,5,7,8Endometriosis associated with a greater risk of complications in pregnancy, European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, EurekAlert!, June6Samuel, Endometriosis During Pregnancy, PregnancyCorner, August 20159Mayo Clinic Staff, Ectopic pregnancy Definition, Mayo Clinic, January 20, 201510Mayo Clinic Staff, Placental abruption Definition, Mayo Clinic, December 13, 201411Mayo Clinic Staff, Placentra previa Definition, Mayo Clinic, May 9, 2014"
232 Toxic Chemicals found in 10 Babies,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/12/31/232-toxic-chemicals-found-in-10-babies.aspx,"Laboratory tests commissioned by the Environmental Working Group have detected bisphenol A (BPA), a plastic component and synthetic estrogen, in umbilical cord blood of American infants. Nine of 10 randomly selected samples of cord blood tested positive for BPA, an industrial petrochemical.  BPA has been implicated in a lengthening list of serious chronic disorders, including cancer, cognitive and behavioral impairments, endocrine system disruption, reproductive and cardiovascular system abnormalities, diabetes, asthma and obesity. In all, the tests found as many as 232 chemicals in the 10 newborns, all of minority descent. The cord blood study has produced hard new evidence that American children are being exposed, beginning in the womb, to complex mixtures of dangerous substances that may have lifelong consequences. And in a separate study, researchers found that complications of pregnancy, such as preterm labor, preterm birth, and infection were lowest in women with the highest vitamin D levels. Blood levels of activated vitamin D usually rise during very early pregnancy, and some of it crosses the placenta to bathe the fetus, especially the developing fetal brain, in activated vitamin D. But many -- in fact most -- pregnant women do not make as much vitamin D as they need. 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day during pregnancy was found to be safe (not a single adverse event). However, this amount only resulted in a mean vitamin D blood level of 27 ng/ml in the newborn infants, indicating that even 4,000 IU per day during pregnancy is not enough. <!--Session data--> [+] Sources and References     Mothering December 9, 2009   Environmental Working Group   New Research Findings Two December 3, 2009   National Institutes of Health"

Pregnant Women Are at Risk Due to Environmental Toxin Exposure,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/07/09/pregnant-women-environmental-toxin-exposure.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  If you're a pregnant woman, avoiding exposure to environmental toxins is one of the most important steps you can take to protect your developing baby. In fact, avoiding toxic exposures while pregnant is equally as important to your baby's health as your healthy diet, stress management, safe exercise, and sound sleep. Unfortunately, few obstetricians routinely warn expectant mothers about the risks of environmental toxins, often because they feel they lack the medical training to do so. Many Doctors Are Unprepared to Discuss Toxic Exposures with Pregnant Women  In a survey of more than 2,500 US obstetricians on the topic of prenatal environmental exposures, the majority (78 percent) agreed that they could reduce women's exposure to environmental health hazards by counseling their patients.1 However, 50 percent said they rarely take an environmental health history and less than 20 percent said they routinely ask about environmental exposures common to pregnant women.  Worse still, only one in 15 obstetricians reported receiving any training on the topic. In short, while most obstetricians acknowledge the importance of talking to pregnant women about exposure to environmental toxins, few actually do in practice because they feel unprepared to do so. The surveyed obstetricians reported the following barriers to environmental counseling:  A lack of knowledge of and uncertainty about the evidence Concerns that patients lack the capacity to reduce harmful exposures Fear of causing anxiety among patients  The study's lead author, Naomi Stotland, a professor of obstetrics at the University of California, San Francisco, explained:2  ""Providers were saying, 'If I bring this up with patients... it's going to raise anxiety and questions that I don't know how to deal with There's a sense that, yes, these things may be harmful, but I don't know how to tell her how to reduce her risk.'""   Developing Babies Are Especially Vulnerable to Environmental Toxins  Obstetricians' reluctance to discuss environmental toxins with pregnant women is unfortunate  and that is a profound understatement. The nine months of development that take place in the womb are the most rapid and most vulnerable period of your baby's life.   And while no one knows exactly what happens when a developing fetus is exposed to hundreds of chemicals in utero, we'll likely be finding out whether we like it or not, as this is occurring daily.   What is known, however, is that children experience greater exposure to chemicals pound-for-pound than adults, and though the blood-brain barrier is fully formed at birth,3 its function may be immature, which may allow greater chemical exposures to reach their developing brains.  Children also have lower levels of some chemical-binding proteins, according to the Environmental Working Group (EWG), which allows more of a chemical to reach their organs, while systems that detoxify and excrete chemicals in adults are not fully developed.4   These factors, coupled with the fact that a child will be around for 80 years or more, allowing more than enough time for chemicals to do their damage, signals a major challenge for kids born today. Experts believe rising rates of birth defects, asthma, neurodevelopmental disorders, and other serious diseases in US children are a result of these early chemical exposures. Environmental Chemicals Induce Multiple Harms with Effects Seen in Childhood and Adulthood   There are approximately 75,000 chemicals regularly manufactured and imported by US industries, and, disturbingly, most of them have never been adequately tested for safety for adults, let alone their impacts on the most vulnerable among us, our children.  It's becoming hard to deny that early life exposure to a slew of chemicals is changing the health of humankind and is likely instrumental in the rising rates of chronic diseases we're seeing among developed countries. How might these toxins be harming your unborn child? A landmark 2005 study by EWG found that blood samples from newborns contained an average of 287 toxins.   Of these, 180 are known to cause cancer in humans or animals, 217 are toxic to your brain and nervous system, and 208 have been found to cause birth defects or abnormal development in animal tests.5 Taken together, the chemical cocktail that bathes most babies in the womb can exert harm in multiple ways. EWG explained:6   ""Some chemicals are directly toxic to an exposed child  lead and mercury, for example, which harm a developing brain  while other chemicals induce a chain of events that may culminate in a diagnosed health problem later in life.   Hormone-mimicking chemicals like dioxins and furans, for example, could induce delayed cancers in hormone-sensitive tissues like the breast, testicle, or prostate gland. Chemicals like PCBs or DDT can reduce growth rates in the womb, initiating in low birth weight babies lasting, internal survival mechanisms that cascade into cardiovascular disease or diabetes later in life.   The fact is, a child can bear a lifelong imprint of risks from the countless molecules of industrial pollutants that find their way through the placenta, down the umbilical cord, and into the baby's body.   The consequences  health disorders, subtle or serious  can surface not only in childhood but also in adulthood. Studies now support origins in early life exposures for a startling array of adult diseases, including Alzheimer's, mental disorders, heart disease, and diabetes.""    High Blood Pressure and Autism Are Risks of Chemical Exposure During Pregnancy   It's difficult to quantify the damage potential of environmental chemicals, especially in utero. However, the studies that have tried have yielded some disturbing results. For instance, earlier this year a study published in the journal PLOS Computational Biology7 found that every 1-percent increase in genital malformations in newborn males within a particular county was associated with a 283 percent increased rate in autism.   According to the researchers, genital malformations such as micropenis, undescended testicles, and hypospadias (when the urethra forms on the underside of the penis) are signs of exposure to harmful toxins.   And the correlation between genital malformation and autism in turn offer strong support for the notion that autism may be at least partially the result of parental overexposure to environmental toxins. According to one of the authors, Andrey Rzhetsky, Ph.D., professor of genetic medicine and human genetics at the University of Chicago:8   ""Autism appears to be strongly correlated with rate of congenital malformations of the genitals in males across the country. This gives an indicator of environmental load and the effect is surprisingly strong... We interpret the results of this study as a strong environmental signal.""    Other recent research has revealed that exposure while in the womb to DDT, a pesticide banned in 1972 after close to 30 years of use, increases women's risk of high blood pressure decades later. Like many environmental toxins, DDT passes freely through the placenta during pregnancy, where it gains direct access to the developing fetus. Past studies have linked DDT to high blood pressure, decreased fertility, premature delivery, and diabetes in adults, but this is the first study to reveal its health risks when exposure occurs prenatally.  The research revealed that women exposed to the most DDT before birth were 2.5 to 3.6 times more likely to develop high blood pressure before the age of 50 than those with the lowest prenatal exposure.9 This means health problems you're experiencing now could potentially be the result of chemical exposures before you were even born.  Damage from Chemical Exposure in Utero May Persist for Many Generations   What is perhaps even more shocking is that toxins you're exposed to while in your mother's womb can end up impacting the health of your great-grandchildren through inherited epigenetic changes. So not only are environmental chemicals potentially jeopardizing the health of your children, they're jeopardizing the health of multiple future generations. EWG noted:10   ""Early life [chemical] exposures can lead to health problems not only in adulthood, but also down through subsequent generations. For instance, adult diseases linked to newborns' low birth weight cause adverse effects not only in those babies born small, but also in their children of any birth size, through heritable changes in gene expression that result in a phenomenon known as 'epigenetic inheritance.' Very different from genetic mutations, which are physical changes in gene structure, epigenetic inheritance is instead characterized by certain genes being turned on or off, but near permanently in ways that can be inherited.   If a genetic mutation is like changing a light fixture, the comparable epigenetic change would involve taping the light switch on or off. Since genes are responsible for making the chemicals that build and repair the body, this unnatural forcing to a permanent on or off position can have far-reaching consequences. In humans, both kinds of genetic changes, mutations as well as epigenetic changes in gene expression, can be passed down to a baby in the womb.""    Even 'Safe' OTC Meds Like Tylenol May Be Harmful   It may be obvious to avoid exposures to toxins like lead, mercury, and pesticides. But if you're pregnant, it is generally best to avoid taking any medications as well, including over-the-counter (OTC) varieties, unless absolutely necessary. This includes while you're trying to conceive, as you could become pregnant and not know it. Most medications have never been tested on pregnant women and their effects on a developing baby are completely unknown. Even the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges that very little is known about the impacts of most medications on unborn babies:11   ""We do not have enough information about the effects of many medications when they are taken by pregnant women All prescription and over-the-counter medications are tested to see if they are safe and effective before they become available to the public. Pregnant women usually are not included in these tests because of the possible risks to the unborn baby. As a result, little information is available about the safety of most medications during pregnancyincluding those available over the counterwhen they first become available.""    Even acetaminophen (Tylenol), which has long been considered the ""safest"" pain reliever for pregnant women, was recently found to be risky as it may raise the risk of behavior problems in your child later on. The study, published in the journal JAMA Pediatrics, noted that ""research data suggest that acetaminophen is a hormone disruptor, and abnormal hormonal exposures in pregnancy may influence fetal brain development.""12 The study included data from more than 64,000 mothers and children in the Danish National Birth Cohort. Over 50 percent of the women reported taking acetaminophen while pregnant, which was found to be linked to:  A 30 percent increased risk for ADHD in the child during the first seven years of life 37 percent increased risk of being diagnosed with hyperkinetic disorder (HKD), a severe form of ADHD   Behavioral effects appeared to be dose dependent. The more frequent the use of acetaminophen during pregnancy, the higher the offspring's chances of being diagnosed with ADHD-related problems. Children of women who used the drug for 20 or more weeks during pregnancy had nearly double the risk of getting an HKD diagnosis. They also had a 50 percent greater chance of being prescribed an ADHD medication. As reported by Forbes:13   ""Acetaminophen can cross the placenta, making its way to the fetus and its delicate developing nervous system. The drug is a known endocrine (hormone) disrupter, and has previously been linked to undescended testes in male infants. Since the maternal hormone environment plays a critical role in the development of the fetus, the authors say that it's 'possible that acetaminophen may interrupt brain development by interfering with maternal hormones or via neurotoxicity such as the induction of oxidative stress that can cause neuronal death.'""    Infographic: Top Toxins to Avoid if You're Pregnant  If you're pregnant or trying to conceive, trying to wade through the information pertaining to toxicant exposures can be overwhelming. The infographic below can help to take some of your anxiety away, as it offers a concise list of some of the most damaging toxins that pregnant women should avoid. Ideally, it's important to reduce your chemical exposures and encourage detoxification before you become pregnant in order to protect your future children from your body's toxic load. With that in mind, here are the top toxins to avoid if you're pregnant or planning to become pregnant, including where you're most likely to find them.     Leading a Healthy Lifestyle Will Minimize Your Chemical Exposures Naturally  Since it's unlikely that your obstetrician will advise you on how to reduce your exposure to environmental toxins, you'll need to take matters into your own hands. As an aside, you may want to consider switching to a pregnancy health care provider that will be more in tune with such risks, including how to avoid them, such as a midwife. You'll want to begin with what are likely your largest avenues of chemical exposures: your diet and your home, starting by paying careful attention to what you eat.  Eating organically grown, biodynamic whole foods are a primary strategy and, as an added bonus, when you eat properly, you're also optimizing your body's natural detoxification system, which can help eliminate toxins your body encounters from other sources. From there, simply leading a healthy lifestyle will help you to have as minimal a chemical exposure as possible. This includes the following:   As much as possible, purchase organic produce and free-range, organic foods to reduce your exposure to pesticides, growth hormones, GMOs, and synthetic fertilizers.  Rather than using conventional or farm-raised fish, which are often heavily contaminated with PCBs and mercury, supplement with a high-quality purified krill oil, or eat fish that is wild-caught and lab tested for purity.  Eat mostly raw, fresh foods, steering clear of processed, prepackaged foods of all kinds. This way you automatically avoid artificial food additives, including dangerous artificial sweeteners, food coloring, and MSG. Freshly grown sprouts are particularly nutritious, especially watercress, sunflower, and pea sprouts. Store your food and beverages in glass rather than plastic, and avoid using plastic wrap and canned foods (which are often lined with BPA- and BPS-containing liners).  Have your tap water tested and, if contaminants are found, install an appropriate water filter on all your faucets (even those in your shower or bath).  Only use natural cleaning products in your home.  Switch over to natural brands of toiletries such as shampoo, toothpaste, antiperspirants, and cosmetics. The Environmental Working Group has a useful database to help you find personal care products that are free of phthalates and other potentially dangerous chemicals.14 I also offer one of the highest quality organic skin care lines, shampoo, and conditioner, and body butter that are completely natural and safe.  Avoid using artificial air fresheners, dryer sheets, fabric softeners, or other synthetic fragrances.  Replace your non-stick pots and pans with ceramic or glass cookware.  When redoing your home, look for ""green"", toxin-free alternatives in lieu of regular paint and vinyl floor coverings.  Replace your vinyl shower curtain with one made of fabric, or install a glass shower door. Most flexible plastics, like shower curtains, contain dangerous plasticizers like phthalates.  Limit your use of drugs (prescription and over-the-counter) as much as possible. Drugs are chemicals too, and they will leave residues and accumulate in your body over time.  Avoid spraying pesticides around your home or insect repellants that contain DEET on your body. There are safe, effective, and natural alternatives out there.

How to Deal with Endometriosis When You Are Pregnant,http://articles.mercola.com/endometriosis/pregnancy.aspx,"It is said that endometriosis typically affects between 3 to 10 percent of women of reproductive age, usually between the ages of 30 and 40, or virtually any woman with menstrual periods.1,2 Unfortunately, pregnant women may also experience endometriosis, although it can be said that its less painful compared to an ordinary womans struggle with the condition. Endometriosis is known to relapse while youre pregnant because of the hormonal environment that prevents the condition from becoming too stressful. However, endometriosis may come back during post-pregnancy.3 A pregnant woman with endometriosis is considered to be a high-risk case because the condition could be life-threatening for the mother and child. Why so? Dr. Lucky Saraswat, a gynecologist consultant from Aberdeen Royal Infirmary in the U.K., explains:4 We believe such changes in the pelvic and uterine environment could influence implantation and development of placenta, predisposing them to adverse pregnancy outcomes. Saraswat is also the first author of a nationwide cohort study that took place in Scotland, wherein the discharge data from all state hospitals was investigated, resulting in an analysis of the health records of 14,655 women.5 These Risks Are Common in Pregnant Women With Endometriosis Although a definite link between pregnancy and endometriosis has yet to be formally announced, there are studies, such as this Scotland study, that  shows that endometriosis increases the risk of a pregnant woman and her child to these conditions:6,7,8     Preterm birth: a woman has a greater risk of delivering her baby earlier compared to a woman without endometriosis. The results from the Scotland study showed that women with a history of endometriosis and had pregnancies that progressed beyond 24 weeks displayed a higher than average risk for preterm birth.    Ectopic pregnancy:9  during an ectopic pregnancy, the fertilized egg implants itself in an area other than the main cavity of the uterus, usually on the fallopian tubes or on the cervix. An odd ratio of 2.7 was recorded when the Scotland study researchers compared the reproductive and pregnancy outcomes of 5,375 women with endometriosis and 8,280 women without endometriosis  with both groups of women being pregnant at the same time and after age and previous pregnancy rates were adjusted.    Caesarean delivery: women with endometriosis may be more likely to deliver their babies via a caesarean section.    Pre-eclampsia: usually occurring among women who are in their second and third trimesters, pre-eclampsia leads to high blood pressure levels.    Antepartum hemorrhage: this is the bleeding that takes place during the second half of the pregnancy. Just like in preterm birth, a womans risk for antepartum hemorrhage shoots up if she is suffering from endometriosis and if her pregnancy has progressed beyond 24 weeks. In numerous cases, however, the cause of bleeding is still unknown, but it could be initiated by placental abruption or placenta previa. Placental abruption occurs when the placenta separates from the inner wall of the uterus, either partially or completely, prior to delivery.10 Meanwhile, placenta previa happens when the babys placenta is partially or completely covering the opening in the mothers cervix.11   Miscarriage: defined as the loss of a pregnancy before 20 weeks, there are some studies that have highlighted endometriosis link with spontaneous abortion, but other studies have still not found any definite link. For miscarriage, an odds ratio of 1.76 was established in the Scotland study.   Stillbirth: a stillbirth is the loss of a pregnancy after 20 weeks. While the connection between endometriosis and stillbirth is yet to be established, some studies have found evidence between these two. Nevertheless, the main cause of stillbirth is still unknown.     < Previous Endometriosis Treatment Next > Endometriosis vs Adenomyosis   Previous Endometriosis Treatment   Next Endometriosis vs Adenomyosis [+] Sources and References      1Endometriosis, UCLA Obstetrics and Gynecology2Endometriosis, WomensHealth.gov3Endometriosis, American Society for Reproductive Medicine, 20124,5,7,8Endometriosis associated with a greater risk of complications in pregnancy, European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology, EurekAlert!, June6Samuel, Endometriosis During Pregnancy, PregnancyCorner, August 20159Mayo Clinic Staff, Ectopic pregnancy Definition, Mayo Clinic, January 20, 201510Mayo Clinic Staff, Placental abruption Definition, Mayo Clinic, December 13, 201411Mayo Clinic Staff, Placentra previa Definition, Mayo Clinic, May 9, 2014"
232 Toxic Chemicals found in 10 Babies,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/12/31/232-toxic-chemicals-found-in-10-babies.aspx,"Laboratory tests commissioned by the Environmental Working Group have detected bisphenol A (BPA), a plastic component and synthetic estrogen, in umbilical cord blood of American infants. Nine of 10 randomly selected samples of cord blood tested positive for BPA, an industrial petrochemical.  BPA has been implicated in a lengthening list of serious chronic disorders, including cancer, cognitive and behavioral impairments, endocrine system disruption, reproductive and cardiovascular system abnormalities, diabetes, asthma and obesity. In all, the tests found as many as 232 chemicals in the 10 newborns, all of minority descent. The cord blood study has produced hard new evidence that American children are being exposed, beginning in the womb, to complex mixtures of dangerous substances that may have lifelong consequences. And in a separate study, researchers found that complications of pregnancy, such as preterm labor, preterm birth, and infection were lowest in women with the highest vitamin D levels. Blood levels of activated vitamin D usually rise during very early pregnancy, and some of it crosses the placenta to bathe the fetus, especially the developing fetal brain, in activated vitamin D. But many -- in fact most -- pregnant women do not make as much vitamin D as they need. 4,000 IU of vitamin D per day during pregnancy was found to be safe (not a single adverse event). However, this amount only resulted in a mean vitamin D blood level of 27 ng/ml in the newborn infants, indicating that even 4,000 IU per day during pregnancy is not enough. <!--Session data--> [+] Sources and References     Mothering December 9, 2009   Environmental Working Group   New Research Findings Two December 3, 2009   National Institutes of Health"

Pregnant Women Are at Risk Due to Environmental Toxin Exposure,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/07/09/pregnant-women-environmental-toxin-exposure.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  If you're a pregnant woman, avoiding exposure to environmental toxins is one of the most important steps you can take to protect your developing baby. In fact, avoiding toxic exposures while pregnant is equally as important to your baby's health as your healthy diet, stress management, safe exercise, and sound sleep. Unfortunately, few obstetricians routinely warn expectant mothers about the risks of environmental toxins, often because they feel they lack the medical training to do so. Many Doctors Are Unprepared to Discuss Toxic Exposures with Pregnant Women  In a survey of more than 2,500 US obstetricians on the topic of prenatal environmental exposures, the majority (78 percent) agreed that they could reduce women's exposure to environmental health hazards by counseling their patients.1 However, 50 percent said they rarely take an environmental health history and less than 20 percent said they routinely ask about environmental exposures common to pregnant women.  Worse still, only one in 15 obstetricians reported receiving any training on the topic. In short, while most obstetricians acknowledge the importance of talking to pregnant women about exposure to environmental toxins, few actually do in practice because they feel unprepared to do so. The surveyed obstetricians reported the following barriers to environmental counseling:  A lack of knowledge of and uncertainty about the evidence Concerns that patients lack the capacity to reduce harmful exposures Fear of causing anxiety among patients  The study's lead author, Naomi Stotland, a professor of obstetrics at the University of California, San Francisco, explained:2  ""Providers were saying, 'If I bring this up with patients... it's going to raise anxiety and questions that I don't know how to deal with There's a sense that, yes, these things may be harmful, but I don't know how to tell her how to reduce her risk.'""   Developing Babies Are Especially Vulnerable to Environmental Toxins  Obstetricians' reluctance to discuss environmental toxins with pregnant women is unfortunate  and that is a profound understatement. The nine months of development that take place in the womb are the most rapid and most vulnerable period of your baby's life.   And while no one knows exactly what happens when a developing fetus is exposed to hundreds of chemicals in utero, we'll likely be finding out whether we like it or not, as this is occurring daily.   What is known, however, is that children experience greater exposure to chemicals pound-for-pound than adults, and though the blood-brain barrier is fully formed at birth,3 its function may be immature, which may allow greater chemical exposures to reach their developing brains.  Children also have lower levels of some chemical-binding proteins, according to the Environmental Working Group (EWG), which allows more of a chemical to reach their organs, while systems that detoxify and excrete chemicals in adults are not fully developed.4   These factors, coupled with the fact that a child will be around for 80 years or more, allowing more than enough time for chemicals to do their damage, signals a major challenge for kids born today. Experts believe rising rates of birth defects, asthma, neurodevelopmental disorders, and other serious diseases in US children are a result of these early chemical exposures. Environmental Chemicals Induce Multiple Harms with Effects Seen in Childhood and Adulthood   There are approximately 75,000 chemicals regularly manufactured and imported by US industries, and, disturbingly, most of them have never been adequately tested for safety for adults, let alone their impacts on the most vulnerable among us, our children.  It's becoming hard to deny that early life exposure to a slew of chemicals is changing the health of humankind and is likely instrumental in the rising rates of chronic diseases we're seeing among developed countries. How might these toxins be harming your unborn child? A landmark 2005 study by EWG found that blood samples from newborns contained an average of 287 toxins.   Of these, 180 are known to cause cancer in humans or animals, 217 are toxic to your brain and nervous system, and 208 have been found to cause birth defects or abnormal development in animal tests.5 Taken together, the chemical cocktail that bathes most babies in the womb can exert harm in multiple ways. EWG explained:6   ""Some chemicals are directly toxic to an exposed child  lead and mercury, for example, which harm a developing brain  while other chemicals induce a chain of events that may culminate in a diagnosed health problem later in life.   Hormone-mimicking chemicals like dioxins and furans, for example, could induce delayed cancers in hormone-sensitive tissues like the breast, testicle, or prostate gland. Chemicals like PCBs or DDT can reduce growth rates in the womb, initiating in low birth weight babies lasting, internal survival mechanisms that cascade into cardiovascular disease or diabetes later in life.   The fact is, a child can bear a lifelong imprint of risks from the countless molecules of industrial pollutants that find their way through the placenta, down the umbilical cord, and into the baby's body.   The consequences  health disorders, subtle or serious  can surface not only in childhood but also in adulthood. Studies now support origins in early life exposures for a startling array of adult diseases, including Alzheimer's, mental disorders, heart disease, and diabetes.""

Trimester of Pregnancy is Crucial,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/08/23/trimester-pregnancy-affects-baby-health.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  The microbes that reside in your gut are very much a living, and integral, part of you. Far from being just passive bystanders, the bacteria are impacted by your health, your lifestyle and even your life stages  and they actively change in response to different periods of your life, like pregnancy.  Your Gut Microbes Change During Each Pregnancy Trimester to Support Fetal Growth  The composition of a woman's gut microbes actually changes during each trimester of pregnancy in ways that support the growth of the fetus. This is largely influenced by the hormonal shifts that occur during pregnancy.  Interestingly, for the first time, research has shown the microbes actually become less diverse and the number of beneficial bacteria decline while disease-related bacteria increase. Under normal circumstances, such changes could lead to weight gain and inflammation, but in pregnancy, they induce metabolic changes that promote energy storage in fat tissue so the fetus can grow.1 The study's lead author noted:2  ""The findings suggest that our bodies have coevolved with the microbiota and may actually be using them as a tool -- to help alter the mother's metabolism to support the growth of the fetus.""  The importance of gut flora continues during and after birth, and may have a profound influence on the baby's health and development. An article in Science Daily reported on the featured findings of one related study,3 stating:4  ""Each individual's community of gut microbes is unique and profoundly sensitive to environmental conditions, beginning at birth. Indeed, the mode of delivery during the birthing process has been shown to affect an infant's microbial profile. Communities of vaginal microbes change during pregnancy in preparation for birth, delivering beneficial microbes to the newborn.  At the time of delivery, the vagina is dominated by a pair of bacterial species, Lactobacillus and Prevotella. In contrast, infants delivered by caesarean section typically show microbial communities associated with the skin, including Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium. While the full implications of these distinctions are still murky, evidence suggests they may affect an infant's subsequent development and health, particularly in terms of susceptibility to pathogens.""  Interestingly, gut flora is not the only factor influenced by the method of birth. One recent study showed that vaginal birth triggers the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in mice, which is important for improving brain development and function in adulthood. The expression of this protein was impaired in mice born via caesarean section (C-section).5   Mom's Gut Bacteria Seriously Impacts Baby's Future Health  Microorganisms in your gastrointestinal tract form a highly intricate, living ""fabric"" that affects body weight, energy, and nutrition, among other factors.  Not only is each individual's community of gut microbes unique, but the groundwork for each person's gut flora is laid from birth. In fact, the mode of delivery during the birthing process has been shown to affect an infant's microbial profile. This is in part why it's so important for pregnant women to become mindful of their gut health, as it will affect not just their own health, but also that of their child.  The health implications of this variation in gut bacteria acquired from birth is exactly what Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride's research sheds light upon. Her research shows there's a profound dynamic interaction between your gut, your brain, and your immune system, starting from birth. She has developed what might be one of the most profoundly important treatment strategies for a wide range of neurological, psychological, and autoimmune disordersall of which are heavily influenced by your gut health.  I believe her Gut and Psychology Syndrome, and Gut and Physiology Syndrome (GAPS) Nutritional program is vitally important for MOST people, as the majority of people have such poor gut health due to poor diet and toxic exposures, but it's particularly crucial for pregnant women and young children.  According to Dr. Campbell-McBride, in children with GAPS, the toxicity flowing from their gut throughout their bodies and into their brains continually challenges their nervous system, preventing it from performing its normal function and process sensory information. GAPS may manifest in a wide range of symptoms, fitting the diagnosis of either autism, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD) without hyperactivity, dyslexia, dyspraxia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, just to name a few possibilities... She explained:  ""What I see in the families of autistic children is that 100 percent of mom's of autistic children have abnormal gut flora and health problems related to that. But then I look at grandmothers on the mother's side, and I find that the grandmothers also have abnormal gut flora, but much milder.""   In essence, what we have is a generational build-up of abnormal gut flora, with each generation becoming ever more prone to being further harmed.  Download Interview Transcript  What Might be Putting Your Gut Flora at Risk?  If you've taken antibiotics or birth control pills, if you eat a lot of processed or sugary foods  even if you were bottle-fed as a baby, all of these can impact the makeup of bacteria and microbes in your gut. For instance, we now know that breastfed babies develop entirely different gut flora compared to bottle-fed babies. Infant formula never was, and never will be, a healthy replacement to breast milk, for a number of reasons -- altered gut flora being one of them.  Dr. Campbell-McBride discovered that a large percentage of the mothers of autistic children were bottle-fed. Then, as they received many courses of antibiotics throughout their childhood, the abnormalities in their gut flora further deepened.   ""Ever since antibiotics were prescribed, particularly from the 50s and 60s, they were prescribed for every cough and sneeze. They really over-prescribed antibiotics. And with every course of antibiotics, the abnormalities in the gut flora would get deeper and deeper in these girls. And then, at the age of 15, 16, these ladies were put on a contraceptive pill [which] have a devastating effect on the gut flora. Nowadays ladies are taking it for quite a few years before they're ready to start their family.""   So, to recap, bottle-feeding along with over-use of antibiotics and use of the contraceptive pill set the stage for increasingly abnormal gut flora with each passing generation. Then, add to that a diet of processed junk food and excessive consumption of fructose and other sugars and you have a prescription for disaster in terms of gastrointestinal health.  Dr. Campbell-McBride continued:  ""Many of these modern factors created a whole plethora of young ladies in our modern world who have quite deeply abnormal gut flora by the time they are ready to have their first child. This is the abnormal gut flora that they are passing through their children.  So these babies acquire abnormal gut flora from the start and while the baby is breastfed the baby is receiving protection because whatever is in the mother's blood will be in her milk. Women who have abnormal gut flora would have immune factors in their blood, which they have developed against their own gut flora to protect them. These immune factors will be in their milk.  While the baby is breastfed, despite the fact that the baby has acquired abnormal gut flora from the mom, there will be some protection. But as soon as the breastfeeding stops that protection stops as well. That is the time when the abnormalities in the gut flora really flourish and the child starts sliding down into autism or ADHD or ADD or any other learning disability or physical problems such as diabetes type 1, for example, and celiac disease or other autoimmune conditions, or asthma, eczema and other physical problems. That's where this epidemic comes from.""   If You're Pregnant, This is One of the Healthiest Types of Food to Eat  Maintaining optimal gut flora by eating raw food grown in healthy, organic soil and 'reseeding' your gut with fermented foods and probiotics (this is essential when you're taking an antibiotic), may be one of the most important steps you can take to improve your health and your baby's during pregnancy. If you aren't eating fermented foods, you most likely need to supplement with a probiotic on a regular basis, especially if you're eating a lot of processed foods.  If you're pregnant, however, I strongly recommend adding fermented foods to your diet. You can ferment virtually any food, and nearly every culture has traditionally fermented their foods to prevent spoilage. There are also many fermented beverages and yoghurts.  Fermenting your own foods is a fairly straightforward process. To learn more, please listen to my interview with Caroline Barringer, a Nutritional Therapy Practitioner (NTP) who has been involved with nutrition for about 20 years and is an expert in the preparation of the foods prescribed in Dr. Campbell-McBride's GAPS Nutritional Program.   Download Interview Transcript  What Can You do to Encourage Healthy Gut Flora Once Your Baby is Born?  Breastfeeding was designed by nature to ensure that your child's gut flora develops properly right from the start, as it is loaded both with beneficial bacteria and nutrient growth factors that will support their continued growth. It also has powerful components that will inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and yeast. So one of the most important foundational elements of building a healthy GI system for your child is to first eat a healthy diet with fermented foods while you're pregnant, and then breastfeed (whenever possible) for at least one year after your child is born. Providing abundant beneficial bacteria in the form of breast milk and, later, fermented foods is one of the most powerful ways to restore your baby's gut flora.  Once your baby is ready to start solid foods, the first fermented food Dr. Campbell-McBride recommends for your infant is raw organic grass-fed yogurt (not commercial yogurt from the grocery store), because it's well tolerated by most infants and children. It's best to make your own yogurt at home from raw organic milk, and start with a very tiny amount. Once yogurt is well tolerated by your baby, then start introducing kefir. If you have any problems with cow's milk, you can always try goat's milk or substitute vegetables fermented with yogurt culture or kefir culture.

Appendicitis During Pregnancy,http://articles.mercola.com/appendicitis/pregnancy.aspx,"Women are particularly more sensitive when they are expecting, as their body goes through many hormonal and physical changes. Certain types of pain are common during this period, particularly abdominal pain.    This is usually normal and is brought on by the expanding uterus, stretching of the ligaments and shifting of the organs. But in some cases, abdominal pain during pregnancy is brought on by certain health conditions  appendicitis is one of them.    Remember that having appendicitis while pregnant can be particularly dangerous both for you and your baby. This is why you should be on the lookout for this ailment and seek help immediately if you feel the symptoms of this ailment.    Incidence of Appendicitis in Pregnant Women  During pregnancy, appendicitis is the most common and non-obstetric emergency that may entail surgery. Its not a rare disorder and is seen in approximately 1 out of 1,500 pregnancies.1  It commonly happens during the second or third trimester, although it may also occur during the first trimester.    The appendicitis incidence rates range from 19 to 36 percent during the first trimester, 27 to 60 percent during the second trimester and 15 to 33 percent during the last three months of pregnancy.2   The incidence of appendicitis in women, is the same whether they are pregnant or not. However, pregnancy increases the risk of perforation.3   Whats alarming is that expectant mothers who have gone through an appendectomy are at a higher risk of fetal loss,4 especially if this condition occurs during early pregnancy and if the mother fails to receive appropriate medical attention immediately.5   Premature contractions and early labor may also be prompted by appendicitis, especially during the third trimester.6  This Condition May Be Mistaken as a Sign of Labor  The problem with accurately diagnosing appendicitis if youre pregnant is that the signs and symptoms are typically similar to those of pregnancy or the onset of labor. Aside from pain in the lower right abdomen, the most common symptoms include:7    Loss of appetite (anorexia)  Nausea  Vomiting   Fever and diarrhea are not common, although uterine contractions and painful or difficult urination (dysuria) may be felt. In some cases, the pain may be in the upper instead of lower right belly, because the appendix changes position during pregnancy.8  Appendicitis During This Delicate Period Must Be Addressed Immediately  If youre pregnant and are experiencing any of the symptoms above, have yourself (and your baby) checked immediately. If not diagnosed and treated promptly, appendicitis can lead to potentially dangerous side effects. This includes complications such as preterm labor, infection and risk of fetal or maternal loss. There is very low risk of the mother dying from appendicitis, though, with less than 2 percent succumbing to this illness. However, your infants health may be in jeopardy.    Those at a higher gestational age have a higher risk of perforation. If the appendix bursts during the third trimester, preterm labor might happen, and if no surgical intervention is done, the risk of fetal loss rises. The first week after the surgery is the riskiest, as it may lead to premature delivery  both the mother and unborn child should be closely monitored during this period.9  Previous Appendicitis in Children Next Appendicitis Duration   Previous Appendicitis in Children   Next Appendicitis Duration [+] Sources and References      1,6American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, May 2000;182(5):1027-92,7,9The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, 2006;19(6):621-6263,4Motherisk, Appendicitis during pregnancy, March 20045Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica, Oct 1999;78(9):758-628Everyday Health, Symptoms of Appendicitis, July 22, 2014"
The Truth About Caffeine (Especially During Pregnancy),http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/01/02/truth-caffeine-pregnancy.aspx,
Why Pregnant Women Should Not Drink Coffee,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/02/03/coffee-in-pregnancy.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  In  recent years, research has emerged demonstrating that coffeein moderationmay  have a number of previously unrecognized health-promoting properties. As a result  of the rather impressive list of therapeutic benefits, I've modified my stance  on coffee. However, it's important to understand that coffee is both a  potent drug, and a whole food provided it's organically grown, and the drug  element of coffee can present problems for pregnant women.  Caffeine can significantly impact the growing fetus as it is  able to freely pass through the placenta, and since caffeine  does not provide any benefits to your  baby, only potential hazards, I strongly recommend pregnant women avoid ALL  forms of caffeine. Unfortunately, most people (pregnant or not) use coffee for its  energy-boosting properties, which ends up serving as a band-aid for poor  nutrition. If you're supplying your body with the nutrients it needs, you simply  won't need the extra energy boost.  If this sounds like you, you may want to consider taking a look at your  dietary habits. Proper nutrition clearly becomes even more important when  pregnant or planning a pregnancy.  Coffee in Pregnancy Tied to Smaller, Later Newborns  In a recent Norwegian study,1 which included data on nearly 60,000 women, coffee and other caffeinated  beverages increased the odds of delivering a low birth weight baby and/or  extended the gestation period.  Lead researcher Dr. Verena Sengpiel, an  obstetrician/gynecologist at the Sahlgrenska Academy of Sahlgrenska University  in Goteborg, Sweden, believes the current recommendations from the American  College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists should be re-evaluated. American  women are currently advised to limit their caffeine intake during pregnancy to  two cups of coffee per day.2 According to Dr. Sengpiel, this may be too much, even though  her observational study cannot prove a cause-and-effect between caffeine and  low birth weight. She told MedicineNet.com:   ""We cannot say from our data whether caffeine is the  specific substance responsible for the fetus being at greater risk of [becoming  a] low birth weight infant, nor did we study if these babies actually had  special health problems during the neonatal period.""   Still, higher caffeine consumption was found to be  associated with an increased risk for reduced birth weight. Every 100 mg of  caffeine consumed by the mother per day equated to a nearly one ounce reduction  in the baby's weight at birth. Every 100 mg of caffeine also increased the  length of the pregnancy by five hours. Interestingly, when the source of the  caffeine was coffee, the length of the pregnancy was extended by eight hours.  The reason for this difference is unknown. Seeing how your average cup of  coffee contains anywhere between 95-200 mg of caffeine, it may be best to err  on the side of caution. According to the featured article:3  ""Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician/gynecologist at Lenox Hill  Hospital in New York City, said, 'Other studies have indicated that  caffeine can affect fetal weight, so this is in accord with findings of other  studies.' Why caffeine might cause this effect is unclear, she said.   'We do know that caffeine crosses the placenta and the  baby is not able to metabolize it very well, [so] it may affect some of the  factors associated with growth,' Wu theorized. She advised that women  limit the amount of caffeine they consume during pregnancy. The World Health  Organization says 300 mg a day, but in the United States the recommended amount  is 200 mg a day, she added.""   Caffeine During Pregnancy May Damage Your Baby's Heart  Previous animal  research from 20094 found  that drinking the equivalent of just two cups of coffee while pregnant could be  enough to affect long-term heart function of the offspring. They also found  that this minimal exposure could lead to increased levels of body fat in males,  when compared to offspring not exposed to caffeine in the womb. Scott Rivkees,  Yale's Associate Chair of Pediatric Research and a senior researcher on the  study, told Medical News Today:5  ""Our studies raise  potential concerns about caffeine exposure during very early pregnancy, but further  studies are necessary to evaluate caffeine's safety during pregnancy.""  In the study,  mice given caffeine during pregnancy produced embryos with ""a thinner layer of  tissue separating some of the heart's chambers than the group that was not  given caffeine."" Long term, this resulted in a 20 percent increase in body fat  in males, and a 35 percent decrease in cardiac function. According to Gerald Weissman, M.D. and  editor-in-chief of the FASEB Journal:6   ""Caffeine is  everywhere: in what we drink, in what we eat, in pills that we use to relieve  pain, and even in candy... This report shows that despite popular notions of  safety, there's one place it probably shouldn't be: in the diet of an expectant  mother.""   When You're Eating for Two...  There is rarely a more nutritionally  demanding time during a woman's life than pregnancy (and later breastfeeding),  when your intake of nutrients from foods and supplements are needed not only to  keep your body running but also to nourish and support your rapidly growing baby.  Proper nutrition is crucial at all stages of fetal development, and if mom  doesn't eat right, her growing baby won't either. If  you're a woman in your childbearing years and you're planning to have children  any time soon, it's imperative that you start eating healthy now. Research7 published just last year showed that women who ate a vegetable-rich diet during  the year before pregnancy had a significantly lower risk of having a baby with  certain birth defects as women who ate an unhealthy high-sugar diet.  Specifically, compared to those who ate unhealthy, women on a healthy diet  experienced:  One-half  lower risk of anencephaly, a neural-tube defect that interferes with brain  development and often results in miscarriage  Up  to a one-third lower risk of cleft lip  One-quarter  lower risk of cleft palate  One-fifth  lower risk of spina bifida, another neural-tube defect   Unfortunately, the researchers lumped saturated  fats in with ""unhealthy fat,"" when they are actually crucial for  pregnant women (and everyone, for that matter), and incorrectly labeled whole  grains as healthy, when the majority of Americans need to limit them. So I  believe their results may have been skewed and may have shown an even greater benefit if a true  healthy diet had been defined.  Crucial Nutrients for Pregnant Women (and Women of Childbearing Age)  Healthy  nutrition cannot be limited to a handful of nutrients; it can only be achieved  by eating a variety of whole, high-quality foods daily. I cannot stress this  enough, as if you seek to make up for a diet of processed foods by taking a  multi-vitamin or eating a salad here and there, you are deceiving yourself and  missing the point -- and the benefits. For a  succinct and easy-to-follow overview of the types of foods and nutrients that  will support a healthy pregnancy, read my optimized nutrition plan.  Ideally, by the time you enter pregnancy you will already be in the Intermediate or Advanced stage, but even the Beginner  stage is far better that the typical American diet. As you'll see, it is  focused on minimizing processed foods while increasing your intake of  vegetables, healthy fats and high-quality sources of protein, all of which are  ideal for nurturing a growing fetus.  For  more detailed healthy pregnancy guidelines, please review my special report: ""No-Nonsense  Guide to a Naturally Healthy Pregnancy and Baby,"" which covers far more than  the basic nutrition tips offered here. Some of the highlights you'll want to be sure  to include though are:  Fermented Foods and/or Probiotics: Nearly everyone can  benefit from optimizing the balance of good vs. bad bacteria in their gut using  probiotics, but if you are pregnant or planning to be, this is of utmost  importance to you and your new baby. One of the best ways to do this is to  avoid sugar and processed foods and to include fermented foods in your diet.   Research shows giving pregnant women and newborns doses of good bacteria can:  Radically reduce the risk of developing autism or autism like disorders Protect babies from developing eczema in childhood Help prevent childhood allergies;8Help optimize your baby's weight later in life;9 Improve the symptoms of colic, decreasing average crying times by about 75  percent;10 reduce your risk of premature labor The best way to ensure optimal gut flora is to regularly consume traditionally  fermented foods, which are naturally rich in probiotics. This includes Lassi,  kefir, sauerkraut and other fermented veggies, natto, kim chee, and tempeh. A  high-quality probiotic supplement is also an option, especially if you don't  eat many fermented foods. Vitamin D: I've included vitamin  D here even though your main source of it should be from the sun, not from food. Along  with reducing your risk of premature birth, studies have found that vitamin D  may protect against a number of birth defects and autism, as well as pregnancy  complications like high  blood pressure. It is absolutely imperative that pregnant women maintain a  blood level of between 50 and 70 ng/ml of 25 hydroxy D, and I am hopeful  that in the not too distant future it will be mandatory for pregnant women to  receive regular vitamin D blood test levels. Vitamin B12: Vitamin B12 is one of  the eight B complex vitamins and is naturally present in foods that come from  animals, including meat, fish, eggs, milk and milk products. B12 is critical  for normal neurological development and maintenance, and shortages can result in permanent birth defects. Note: If you eat a vegan diet, you are  likely to be dangerously  deficient in vitamin B12. Folate in the form of Metafolate: Another B complex vitamin (vitamin B9), folic acid deficiency at the time of conception is known  to increase the risk for birth defects such as spina bifida.Many women are aware of this and take folic acid supplements in their prenatal  vitamins, but many are not aware that in order for folic acid to perform its crucial duties in your body, and for your fetus, it must first be activated into the biologically active  form  L-5-MTHF. This is the form that's most usable by your body and the form  that's able to cross the blood-brain barrier to carry out important brain  functions. Nearly half of the population has difficulty converting folic acid to the bioactive 5-MTHF form because of a genetic reduction in enzyme activity, so it's important to look for metafolate or metafolin in your multi-vitamin  instead of folic acid.Be sure to read the label closely, as many companies  don't use the bioactive form because it is too expensive and about 10 times  more costly.Of course even better than a supplement would be a wide variety of healthy,  fresh, organically grown vegetables, which will supply not only folic acid in  the correct form but all the other important accessory micronutrients. Animal-Based Omega-3 Fats: Most women have major  deficiencies of animal-based omega-3  fat like EPA and DHA, which is unfortunate because fetal cells cannot form  omega-3 fats, meaning a fetus must obtain all of its omega-3 fatty acids  from mother's diet. A mother's dietary intake and plasma concentrations of  DHA directly influence the DHA status of the developing fetus.    DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is so essential to a child's development that if a  mother and infant are deficient in it, the child's nervous system and immune  system may never fully develop, and it can cause a lifetime of unexplained  emotional, learning, and immune system disorders. DHA makes up 15 percent to 20  percent of the cerebral cortex and 30 percent to 60 percent of the retina so it  is absolutely necessary for normal development of the fetus in utero, and  as a baby post birth.  Studies have shown that sufficient levels of omega-3 fats optimize brain growth  in children, especially during the third trimester. But because the fetus  depends on the mother's DHA sources, the constant drain on a mother's DHA  reserves can easily lead to a deficiency and some researchers believe that  preeclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure) and postpartum depression  could be linked to a DHA deficiency. The DHA in animal-based omega-3 fats will  also help to prevent the vast majority of premature deliveries.   If You're NOT Pregnant, Keep These Coffee Drinking Tips in Mind  Getting  back to coffee, I believe there are ways to include coffee in a healthy  lifestyle, provided you're not using it as a crutch to mask symptoms of a poor  diet, resulting in flagging energy levelsand provided you're not pregnant. To learn more, see this previous article on the health benefits of coffee. That said, another major caveat to  coffee drinking is quality. You can  find a great deal of information at Coffee & Conservation.11  Here are five primary considerations to follow if you want to use coffee for  its therapeutic benefits:  Choose Organic: Coffee beans are one of the most heavily sprayed crops. So, you should select only coffee  beans that are certified organic and hence grown without pesticides. This is  important, as you will obliterate ANY positive effects if you consume coffee  that's been doused in pesticides or other chemicals. Whenever possible,  purchase sustainable ""shade-grown"" coffee to help prevent the  continued destruction of our tropical rain forests and the birds that inhabit  them. There are many who say shade grown coffee tastes better as well.  Whole Bean: You'll want to  purchase whole bean coffee that smells and tastes fresh, not stale; if your  coffee does not have a pleasant aroma, it is likely rancid. Grind it yourself to  prevent rancidity as pre-ground coffee may be rancid by the time you get it  home.  Drink It Black: If you're interested  in the health benefits, drink your coffee black, without sugar or cream or  flavorings. Add sugar and you'll certainly ruin any of the benefits by spiking  your insulin levels, which contributes to insulin resistance. Make sure the  water you're using is pure.  Coffee Filters: If you use a  ""drip"" coffee maker, be sure to use non-bleached filters. The bright  white ones are chlorine-bleached, and some of this chlorine will leach from the  filter during the brewing process. Bleached filters are also notoriously full  of dangerous disinfection byproducts, such as dioxin.  Coffee Mugs: Be careful about  the container you use. Avoid plastic cups as the BPA will leach into your drink. Styrofoam cups can also leach chemicals. Your best  bets include glass and ceramic travel mugs.   Again, remember that while coffee has the potential to be  used therapeutically, you need to view it as both a drug and a whole food. As  other drugs, caffeine can have a potent impact and should be respected and used  with caution. As a whole food, it needs to fulfill certain criteria. Much of  the commercial coffee available can be likened to ""junk food"" in that it's  loaded with pesticide residues and otherwise of poor quality... The most important caveat is to avoid coffee and other sources of caffeine during pregnancy. There  are far too many contraindications during this time, and plenty of evidence  that it can cause long-term harm.If you feel like you cannot drag yourself into work without one or more  cups of coffee, you may want to address your diet and exercise, which is at the  root of your fatigue. If you're supplying your body with the nutrients it  needs, you simply won't need the extra energy boost.

Taking Antibiotics During Pregnancy Is a Bad Idea,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/12/06/antibiotics-during-pregnancy.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  According to recent research1 from Denmark, children whose mothers took antibiotics during their pregnancy were more likely to develop asthma, compared to those whose mother did not take antibiotics. Taking other risk factors into account, the researchers estimated that children exposed to antibiotics were 17 percent more likely to be hospitalized for asthma before the age of five. Furthermore, children who were predisposed to asthma due to their mother having the condition were twice as likely to develop asthma if their mother used antibiotics during the third trimester, compared to those whose mother did not use antibiotics.  While the study doesn't prove causation (they cannot tell whether the asthma was the result of the antibiotic or the infection itself), the increased asthma risk found does support the theory that probiotics  beneficial bacteria residing in your gut, which are decimated by antibiotics  play a role in the development of asthma. Co-author Dr. Hans Bisgaard told Reuters Health2:   ""We speculate that mothers' use of antibiotics changes the balance of natural bacteria, which is transmitted to the newborn, and that such unbalanced bacteria in early life impact on the immune maturation in the newborn.""   Indeed, one of the most important prerequisites for your newborn is establishing a healthy gastrointestinal tract. Regardless of age, your gut is your first line of defense in terms of immunity. Without a well-functioning GI tract, your child will not get the proper nourishment to grow, or defend himself against pathogens of all types.  The baby gets his or her first ""inoculation"" of gut flora from the mother's birth canal during childbirth, which is why a mother's use of antibiotics during pregnancy can predispose the child to asthma and a variety of other ailments.It's important to understand that if a mother'sflora is abnormal,her baby's flora will also be abnormal, as whatever organisms live in her vagina end up coatingher baby's body and lining his or her intestinal tract.  The Importance of Gut Health During Pregnancy  Unfortunately, studies show that a growing number of women have unknown vaginal infections at childbirth, which can result in the passage of abnormal microflora onto their babies. This introduction of unfriendly flora, combined with antibiotic use, can predispose a baby to GAPS (Gut and Psychology Syndrome, and also Gut and Physiology Syndrome). GAPS can have very damaging long-term effects on a child's health, both neurologically and physiologically, predisposing him or her to:    Autism, ADHD/ADD and learning disabilities, such as dyslexia  Arthritis  Asthma and allergies    Mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder  Skin problems  Kidney problems    Schizophrenia  Digestive ailments  Autoimmune disorders      GAPS may have profound implications for the autism epidemic. Rates of childhood autism are staggering, now 50 times higher in some areas than three decades ago. Not surprisingly, there is a matching epidemic of GAPS. Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride is a neurologist and neurosurgeon who has devoted years of her career to studying this phenomenon, and how to treat and prevent it. To learn more, please listen to the interview featured in my previous article How a Physician Cured Her Son's Autism.  In this follow-up interview, she discusses the physiological aspect of GAPS, and its impact on autoimmune disease and allergies.   Download Interview Transcript  Antibiotic Resistance Major Public Health Problem  The frivolous use of antibiotics, not just in medicine, but also in food production, is the root cause of skyrocketing antibiotic resistance. Data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control3 (ECDC) shows a significant rise of resistance to multiple antibiotics in Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli in just the last four years alone, affecting more than one-third of the EU. According to a recent report by Medical News Today4:  ""In several of the member states, between 25 and over 60 percent of K pneumoniae from bloodstream infections show combined resistance to multiple antibiotics.... The ECDC data shows that consumption of carbapenems, a major class of last-line antibiotics, went up significantly in EU/EEA countries between 2007 and 2010. The report suggests this is most likely due to increasing multidrug resistance in Gram-negative infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections, which are often treated with carbapenems.""  November 18 was European Antibiotic Awareness Day5. The UK issued an informational leaflet6 to raise awareness about the need for judicious use of antibiotics, urging patients to not ask their doctors for an antibiotic to treat symptoms of cold and flu, as antibiotics do not work on infections caused by viruses. Americans also need to heed this advice, as a recent poll shows many Americans are still a bit clueless about antibiotics and antibiotic resistance.  As reported by MedicineNet.com7:  ""[A]lthough almost 90 percent of Americans know that antibiotics are effective for treating bacterial infections, more than a third also erroneously believed the drugs can fight viral infections such as the common cold or the flu...   'It's a common misperception that antibiotics can cure the common cold, and unnecessary overuse of antibiotics for illnesses like colds is dumping fuel on a wildfire of resistance,"" said Dr. Lauri Hicks, medical director of the 'Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work' program at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.... Many participants wrongly believed that individuals build up tolerance to antibiotics, when it is the bacteria themselves that become resistant.'     Rise in Antibiotic Resistance is Alarming  Between the years of 1993 and 2005, the number of Americans hospitalized due to the antibiotic-resistant ""superbug"" MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) skyrocketed from about 2,000 to 370,000. Currently, MRSA and other antibiotic-resistant infections kill about 60,000 Americans annually, and account for billions of dollars in health care costs8. According to many health experts, antibiotic-resistance is one of our greatest health threats, and it's really all our own doing. When used properly, in the correct contexts and with responsibility, antibiotics can and do save lives that are threatened by bacterial infections. But there is one important variable that wasn't considered when the widespread use of these ""miracle medicines"" began, and that is that bacteria are highly adaptable. They are clearly capable of outsmarting antibiotics, and they are doing so with a vengeance. According to the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System9:  ""Antibiotics kill or inhibit the growth of susceptible bacteria. Sometimes one of the bacteria survives because it has the ability to neutralize or evade the effect of the antibiotic; that one bacteria can then multiply and replace all the bacteria that were killed off.   Exposure to antibiotics therefore provides selective pressure, which makes the surviving bacteria more likely to be resistant. In addition, bacteria that were at one time susceptible to an antibiotic can acquire resistance through mutation of their genetic material or by acquiring pieces of DNA that code for the resistance properties from other bacteria.The DNA that codes for resistance can be grouped in a single easily transferable package. This means that bacteria can become resistant to many antimicrobial agents because of the transfer of one piece of DNA.""  The Rise of ""Superbugs""...  Bacteria are, in essence, hard-wired to adapt to threats such as antibiotics and, as such, there has been talk that the ""end of antibiotics"" is near. At that point, infections that were once easily treated will undoubtedly return with renewed force. Casualties are to be expected... Numerous bacteria are already resistant to many commonly prescribed antibiotics10, including:    Acinetobacter: A bacteria found in soil and water that often causes infections in seriously ill hospital patients.  Anthrax: Spread by infected animals or potentially bioterrorist weapons.  Group B streptococcus: A common bacteria in newborns, the elderly and adults with other illnesses.    Klebsiella pneumonia: A bacteria that can lead to pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound and surgical site infections and meningitis.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): A superbug that can be so difficult to treat, it can easily progress from a superficial skin infection to a life-threatening infection in your bones, joints, bloodstream, heart valves, lungs, or surgical wounds.  Neisseria meningitides: One of the leading causes of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults.    Shigella: An infectious disease caused by Shigella bacteria.  Streptococcus pneumoniae: A leading cause of pneumonia, bacteremia, sinusitis, and acute otitis media (AOM).  Tuberculosis (TB): Both ""multi-drug resistant"" and ""extensively drug-resistant"" forms of TB are now being seen.    Typhoid fever: A life-threatening illness caused by the Salmonella Typhi bacteria.  Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE): Infection with the enteroccocci bacteria that often occurs in hospitals and is resistant to vancomycin, an antibiotic.  Vancomycin-Intermediate/Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA/VRSA): Various strains of staph bacteria that are resistant to vancomycin.      Two of the latest drug-resistant infections are gonorrhea and tuberculosis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the first reports of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis began surfacing in 200611. WHO now also recognizes drug-resistant gonorrhea as ""an emergency."" Earlier this summer, Wired Magazine12 reported on the issue:  ""Millions of people with gonorrhoea may be at risk of running out of treatment options unless urgent action is taken, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Already several countries, including Australia, France, Japan, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom are reporting cases of resistance to cephalosporin antibiotics  the last treatment option against gonorrhoea. Every year an estimated 106 million people are infected.""  Your Dietary Choices Also Contribute to Rising Antibiotic Resistance  Compounding the problem is the fact that antibiotics are also widely over-used in agriculture. In fact, agricultural uses account for about 70 percent of all antibiotic use in the US, so it's a MAJOR source of human antibiotic consumption. Animals are often fed antibiotics at low doses for disease prevention and growth promotion, and those antibiotics are transferred to you via meat, and even via the manure used as crop fertilizer.  Reducing the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is yet another reason for making sure you're only eating grass-fed, organically-raised meats.  What You Can Do to Help Stop the Spread of Antibiotic-Resistant Disease  You can help yourself and your community by using antibiotics only when absolutely necessary and by purchasing organic, antibiotic-free meats and other foods. We're all in this fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria together, and the more people who get involved on a personal level to stop unnecessary antibiotic use the better. Avoiding all unnecessary antibiotics is an important step that I urge everyone to take, even though ultimately the problem of antibiotic-resistance needs to be stemmed through public policy on a nationwide level. If you live in the United States and want to get involved on a national level, Food Democracy Now! has created a petition against the overuse of antibiotics in livestock production13. If you care about this issue, I suggest you use this petition to make your voice heard. Also, to bring us back to the first featured story, please make sure to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics during pregnancy. Not every bacterial infection needs to be treated with a drug. First, as an all-around preventive measure, you'll want to make sure your vitamin D level is optimized year-round, especially during pregnancy, along with vitamin K2. But there are also a number of natural compounds that act as broad-based antibiotics/anti-virals that you can try first, such as:  Oregano Garlic  Echinacea  Manuka honey (for topical application) [+] Sources and References      1The Journal of Pediatrics, Published Online November 8, 2012 2Reuters Health November 19, 2012 3European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control  4Medical News Today November 19, 2012 5European Antibiotic Awareness Day 6Antibiotic Information Leaflet 7MedicineNet.com November 13, 2012 8See ref 79CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System 10CDC, Antibiotic Resistance 11WHO, Drug Resistant Tuberculosis 12Wired Magazine June 6, 2012 13Food Democracy Now!

Top Foods to Eat When You're Pregnant,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/11/02/top-pregnancy-foods.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  There is rarely a more nutritionally demanding time during a woman's life than pregnancy (and later breastfeeding), when your intake of nutrients from foods and supplements are needed not only to keep your body running, but also to nourish and support your rapidly growing baby.   Proper nutrition is crucial at all stages of fetal development (and even before conception), and if mom doesn't eat right, her growing baby won't either. For a succinct and easy-to-follow overview of the types of foods and nutrients that will support a healthy pregnancy, read my optimized nutrition plan.   Ideally, by the time you enter pregnancy, you will already be in the Intermediate or Advanced stage, but even the Beginner stage is far better that the typical American diet. As you'll see, it is focused on minimizing processed foods while increasing your intake of vegetables, healthy fats, and high-quality sources of protein, all of which are ideal for nurturing a growing fetus.   If you're wondering about specific foods, see below for some of the top superfoods to eat when you're pregnant.  10 Top Foods to Eat When You're Pregnant   1. Vitamin D   Vitamin D isn't a food but rather is made by your body in response to sunlight exposure. It's so important, however, that it deserves to be number one on this list.   Raising vitamin D levels among pregnant women is of particular concern, as deficiency affects not only the mother, increasing her risk of complications during pregnancy or delivery, but also has short- and long-term ramifications for her child's health.   I firmly believe optimizing your vitamin D during pregnancy is one of the most important things you can do for the health of your child. When a child is born deficient in vitamin D, his or her health can be significantly affected in any number of ways.  Research confirms there is a lifelong impact of vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy ranging from childhood allergies to asthma, colds and flu, dental cavities, diabetes, and even strokes and cardiovascular disease in later life of the child.   Further, each year, more than half a million preemies are born, and it's the number one killer of newborns. It's also the second leading cause of death among children under the age of five. Research shows that vitamin D could likely prevent half of all these premature births.  It can also cut your risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and prenatal infections by approximately 50 percent. Among African-American and Hispanic populations, approximately 70 to 75 percent of all preterm births could be prevented with vitamin D optimization. Vitamin D screening is key.  This is the only way to determine whether you might be deficient or not, and regular testing is important to make sure whatever dosage of vitamin D you're taking is sufficient to reach clinically relevant levels. GrassrootsHealth, which has a panel of 42 researchers who provide scientific evidence, recommends maintaining a vitamin D blood serum level of 40 to 60 ng/ml to protect your and your baby's health.  However, according to previous studies, your levels need to be above 50 ng/ml to protect your baby from serious complications, such as premature delivery and preeclampsia.1 So please, if you're pregnant, make sure to get your 25-hydroxy D levels checked.  While optimizing your vitamin D through sensible sun exposure is best, if this isn't possible Dr. Bruce Hollis' research indicates that 50 percent of women can achieve this level with 4,000 IUs daily during pregnancy and 6,400 IUs (for nursing mothers) of vitamin D3 on a daily basis. Again, you'll need to have your vitamin D levels tested to be sure you're within the optimal range.  2. Organic Free-Range Eggs   Eggs are a phenomenal source of protein, fat, and other nutrients, including choline and the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin. In pregnant women, choline plays an important role helping to prevent certain birth defects, such as spina bifida, and playing a role in brain development.   Prior research has concluded that choline intake during pregnancy ""super-charged"" the brain activity of animals in utero, indicating that it may boost cognitive function, improve learning and memory, and even diminish age-related memory decline and the brain's vulnerability to toxins during childhood, as well as conferring protection later in life.2  Consumption of higher levels of choline during pregnancy (about double the recommended pregnancy intake) is linked to beneficial epigenetic changes in the fetus, including protection from stress-related and metabolic disorders, that likely last into adulthood.3  3. Wild-Caught Alaskan or Sockeye Salmon, Sardines    Fish has always been the best source for the animal-based omega-3 fats EPA and DHA, but as levels of pollution have increased you have to be very choosy about which types of seafood you decide to eat  especially when you're pregnant.  If you're not careful, the toxic effects from the pollutants in the fish will outweigh the benefits of the omega-3 fats. Among the safest in terms of contamination, and the highest in healthy omega-3 fat, is wild-caught Alaskan and sockeye salmon.   Neither is allowed to be farmed, and are therefore always wild-caught. The risk of sockeye accumulating high amounts of mercury and other toxins is reduced because of its short life cycle, which is only about three years.   Additionally, bioaccumulation of toxins is also reduced by the fact that it doesn't feed on other, already contaminated, fish. The two designations you want to look for on the label are: ""Alaskan salmon"" (or wild Alaskan salmon) and ""Sockeye salmon.""   Canned salmon labeled ""Alaskan salmon"" is also a reasonable choice and offers a less expensive alternative to salmon fillets. A general guideline is that the closer to the bottom of the food chain the fish is, the less contamination it will have accumulated, so other safer choices include smaller fish like sardines, anchovies, and herring.   Sardines, in particular, are one of the most concentrated sources of omega-3 fats. They also contain a wealth of other nutrients, from vitamin B12 and selenium to protein, calcium, and choline, making them one of the best dietary sources of animal-based omega-3s. You can also supplement your diet with animal-based omega-3s by taking a krill oil supplement.   4. Full-Fat Grass-Fed Dairy   Whole dairy products made from grass-fed raw milk are a rich source of healthy fats, protein, calcium, B vitamins, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, and more. Grass-fed raw butter, milk, and cheese from high-quality sources are all beneficial. Raw organic milk from grass-fed cows not only contains beneficial bacteria that prime your immune system and can help reduce allergies, it's also an outstanding source of vitamins (especially vitamin A), zinc, enzymes, and healthy fats. Your absolute best bet when it comes to yogurt is to make your own using a starter culture and raw grass-fed milk, which you combine and leave at room temperature overnight.  By the time you wake up in the morning, you will likely have kefir (fermented milk). If it hasn't obtained the consistency of yogurt, you might want to set it out a bit longer and then store it in the fridge. If you want to sweeten up your homemade yogurt naturally, try adding in some whole berries or dried (unsweetened) coconut.    5. Sweet Potatoes   Orange-colored sweet potatoes owe their appearance to the carotenoid beta-carotene. As an antioxidant, beta-carotene can help ward off free radicals that damage cells through oxidation, which can speed up aging and make you vulnerable against chronic diseases.   This antioxidant can help support your immune system, as well as lower your risk of heart disease and cancer. It's also very important during pregnancy, as it's converted into vitamin A in your body.   Vitamin A is essential for fetal health and development, but high levels of animal-based vitamin A may cause toxicity, making beta-carotene an ideal alternative. Sweet potatoes are also an excellent source of fiber, which can help support healthy blood sugar levels and improve digestion.   6. Broccoli and Leafy Greens  Broccoli and dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale are loaded with important nutrients for pregnant women, including folate, fiber, potassium, calcium, iron, and vitamins C, K, and A. Their rich antioxidant content will also support your immune system health and digestion, while their fiber can help prevent constipation, which is a common problem in pregnant women.  7. Grass-Fed Beef and Pasture-Raised Chicken   Grass-fed beef is an excellent source of protein and other nutrients in high demand during pregnancy, like iron, choline, and B vitamins. Chicken is an excellent source of protein, B vitamins, selenium, phosphorus, and choline. It provides all B vitamins along with a surprisingly varied number of additional nutrients.   8. Berries  Berries contain concentrated amounts of the disease-fighting phytochemicals found to boost your immunity, prevent cancer, protect your heart, and prevent seasonal allergies. Berries are lower in sugar than many fruits, so they are less likely to destabilize your insulin levels. Berries also contain high amounts of vitamin C, which will help your body absorb iron, and a good amount of fiber.  9. Avocados  Avocados provide close to 20 essential health-boosting nutrients, including potassium, vitamin E, vitamin K, B vitamins, and folate. They're also one of few foods that contain significant levels of both vitamins C and E and are an excellent source of healthy monounsaturated fat. Avocados are even high in fiber, with about 4.6 grams in half an avocado. Fiber plays an essential role in your digestive, heart, and skin health, and may improve blood sugar control, and more, so when you eat avocados you're really providing your body  and your baby  with a comprehensive package of nutrition.  10. Chia Seeds  Chia seeds are a quick and easy-to-use source of protein, healthy fats, dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants, all rolled into one neat package. Although they have similar health benefits to flax seeds, chia seeds may soon edge these out because they don't have to be ground prior to consumption, and they don't go rancid as quickly either. Their high concentration of the plant-based omega-3 fat alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is one of their major claims to fame. Chia seeds contain up to 40 percent oil, with 60 percent comprised of plant-based omega-3.4   New Benefits Revealed for a High-Fiber Diet During Pregnancy  A fiber-rich diet is recommended for most adults, but ramping up your fiber intake may be especially beneficial during pregnancy. Researchers from the Department of Immunology at Monash University in Australia revealed that a high-fiber diet may beneficially alter a woman's gut bacteria during pregnancy, producing anti-inflammatory substances that suppress asthma-related genes in her baby.5,6 Mounting research also suggests that a high-fiber diet can help reduce your risk of premature death from any cause, likely because it helps to reduce your risk of a number of chronic diseases.  This includes type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Studies have also linked a high-fiber diet to beneficial reductions in blood pressure, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced inflammation  all of which can benefit your baby. The best way to increase your fiber intake during pregnancy is to focus on eating more vegetables, nuts, and seeds. The following whole foods, for example, contain high levels of both soluble and insoluble fiber.     Psyllium seed husk, flax hemp, and chia seeds  Berries  Vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts    Root vegetables and tubers, including onions, sweet potatoes, and jicama Almonds Peas   Green beans Cauliflower Beans    Gaining Too Much Weight During Pregnancy Linked to Children's Obesity   Healthy weight gain is important and expected during pregnancy, but women who are overweight before pregnancy, and those who gain too much weight while pregnant, may be putting their babies at risk of childhood obesity. Researchers followed more than 700 women who returned for follow up with their children were 7 years old. Children of mothers who had been overweight prior to pregnancy were more likely to be overweight.   Women with greater weight gain during pregnancy were also more likely to have children with a higher percentage of body fat, and those with excessive weight gain were nearly three times more likely to have obese children than those who did not gain weight excessively during pregnancy.7 The Institute of Medicine recommends women of average weight gain 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy, while overweight women should gain 15 to 25 pounds and obese women gain just 11 to 20 pounds.8   More Risks Revealed for Lack of Vitamin D During Pregnancy  From my perspective, it is simply reprehensible malpractice for a health care professional to fail to address your vitamin D level if you're pregnant  it's just that important. For pregnant women, optimizing your vitamin D is even more important for your child's health and development than folate, which is routinely recommended for pregnant women.  Recent research shed even more light on what's at stake if your vitamin D levels are low during pregnancy. One study revealed that women with low levels of vitamins D and E in early pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of asthma in her child within the first 10 years of life.9 Separate research found newborns of mothers whose diets were deficient in vitamins D and E had airway cells that reacted more to irritants and allergens.10 This may, in turn, impact the development of asthma or allergies later in life. Separate research also added to past data linking low vitamin D levels during pregnancy with premature birth. Women with the lowest levels of vitamin D were 1.5 times more likely to deliver early than those with the highest levels, perhaps because vitamin D helps reduce bacterial infection in the placenta, which may trigger early delivery.11 Along with reducing your risk of premature birth, studies have found that vitamin D may protect against a number of birth defects and autism, as well as pregnancy complications like high blood pressure. It is absolutely imperative that pregnant women maintain a blood level of between 50 and 70 ng/ml of 25-hydroxy D, and I am hopeful that in the not too distant future it will be mandatory for pregnant women to receive regular vitamin D blood test levels.   Dad's Diet Matters for Baby's Health, Too  It's not only mom's diet that influences the future health of her offspring. A father's diet prior to conception may also play a role, particularly in regard to folate. An animal study showed that paternal folate deficiency was associated with an increase in birth defects in offspring compared to fathers eating a folate-sufficient diet. There was, in fact, a nearly 30 percent increase in birth defects, including severe skeletal abnormalities, among litters sired by fathers who were deficient in folate. The Epoch Times reported:12   ""The research shows that there are regions of the sperm epigenome that are sensitive to life experience and particularly to diet. And that this information is in turn transferred to a so-called epigenomic map that influences development and may also influence metabolism and disease in the offspring in the long term. The epigenome is like a switch, which is affected by environmental cues, and is involved in many diseases including cancer and diabetes.   The epigenome influences the way that genes are turned on or off and hence how heritable information gets passed along. Although it has been known for some time that there is a massive erasure and re-establishment that takes place in the epigenome as the sperm develops, this study shows that along with the developmental map, the sperm also carries a memory of the father's environment and possibly even of his diet and lifestyle choices.""   If You're Planning to Have Children, the Time to Start Eating Right Is Now   If you're a woman (or a man) in your childbearing years and you're planning to have children any time soon, it's imperative that you start eating healthy now. Research published in 2013 showed that women who ate a vegetable-rich diet during the year before pregnancy had a significantly lower risk of having a baby with certain birth defects compared to women who ate an unhealthy high-sugar diet.13 Specifically, compared to those who ate unhealthy, women on a healthy diet experienced:  One-half  lower risk of anencephaly, a neural-tube defect that interferes with brain  development and often results in miscarriage  Up  to a one-third lower risk of cleft lip  One-quarter  lower risk of cleft palate  One-fifth  lower risk of spina bifida, another neural-tube defect   Finally, one additional food group that hasn't yet been mentioned, but is crucially important for pregnant women, is fermented foods. Nearly everyone can benefit from the beneficial microbes in fermented vegetables, but if you are pregnant or planning to be, this is of utmost importance to you and your new baby. Research shows giving pregnant women and newborns doses of good bacteria like those found in fermented vegetables may:    Radically reduce your child's risk of developing autism or autism-like disordersProtect babies from developing eczema in childhoodHelp prevent childhood allergies  Help optimize your baby's weight later in lifeImprove the symptoms of colic, decreasing average crying times by about 75 percentReduce your risk of premature labor   For more detailed healthy pregnancy guidelines, please review my special report: ""No-Nonsense Guide to a Naturally Healthy Pregnancy and Baby,"" which covers far more than the basic nutrition tips offered here.

Vaccination During Pregnancy: Is It Really Safe?,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/11/10/vaccination-during-pregnancy.aspx,"By Barbara Loe Fisher  It was 1977 when I found out I was going to become a Mom. I instinctively knew I needed to be careful while I was pregnant, especially during the first two trimesters when the major organ systems of the fetus develop at a rapid rate. In the 1960s, there had been a lot of publicity about babies dying or being born without arms or legs because women had taken a drug (Thalidomide) for morning sickness in the first or second trimester of pregnancy1 and I wanted to make sure I did everything I could to protect my health and the health of my baby before and after he was born. Mothers to be in my generation were told to take extra vitamins and eat nutritious food but, most of all, to avoid anything that could harm the developing fetus like alcohol, cigarette smoke, medications, radiation, household cleaning products and other toxic exposures. Some of us were aware of the risks of heavy anesthesia during delivery and signed up for Lamaze classes to prepare for a drug-free birth, which many obstetricians discouraged, and we chose to breastfeed, even though a lot of pediatricians were pushing formula and bottles back then. Today, pregnant women face a different set of difficult questions and choices about keeping themselves and their babies healthy. Among them are whether or not to get vaccinations during pregnancy that public health officials, obstetricians and pediatricians say will protect pregnant women and their newborns from getting sick with influenza and B. pertussis whooping cough.  Toxic Exposures & Assumption of Safety  Is It A Good Idea?  Although since the 1970s, public health officials have recommended influenza vaccinations for pregnant women in the second or third trimester,2 relatively few obstetricians promoted the vaccine until the past decade when, in 2006, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) strengthened recommendations that all pregnant women, healthy or not, should get a flu shot in any trimester.3   Then, in 2011, a pertussis containing Tdap shot was recommended for all pregnant women, preferably after 20 weeks gestation.4 Both current vaccine recommendations are5, 6, 7 endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),8, 9 the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other medical trade associations.10, 11 With these recommendations, the time-honored rule of avoiding any potential toxic exposure that might interfere with the normal development of the fetus has been suspended and replaced with an assumption that vaccination during pregnancy is safe. But what is the scientific evidence documenting that this assumption is a well-informed one?  Glaring Lack of Safety Testing  You have to look no further than information in the vaccine manufacturer product inserts and posted online by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to quickly answer that question. FACT: Drug companies did not test the safety and effectiveness of giving influenza or Tdap vaccine to pregnant women before the vaccines were licensed in the U.S.12, 13 and there is almost no data on inflammatory or other biological responses to these vaccines that could affect pregnancy and birth outcomes.14 FACT: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists influenza and Tdap vaccines as either Pregnancy Category B or C biologicals,15 which means that adequate testing has not been done in humans to demonstrate safety for pregnant women and it is not known whether the vaccines can cause fetal harm or affect reproduction capacity. The manufacturers of influenza and Tdap vaccines state that human toxicity and fertility studies are inadequate and warn that the influenza and Tdap vaccines should ""be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.""16, 17, 18 FACT: There are ingredients in influenza and pertussis containing Tdap vaccines that have not been fully evaluated for potential genotoxic19 or other adverse effects on the human fetus developing in the womb that may negatively affect health after birth, including aluminum adjuvants, mercury containing (Thimerosal) preservatives and many more bioactive and potentially toxic ingredients.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 FACT: There are serious problems with outdated testing procedures for determining the potency and toxicity of pertussis vaccines and some scientists are calling for limits to be established for specific toxin content of pertussis-containing vaccines.30 FACT: There are no published biological mechanism studies that assess pre-vaccination health status and measure changes in brain and immune function and chromosomal integrity after vaccination of pregnant women or their babies developing in the womb.31 FACT: Since licensure of influenza and Tdap vaccines in the U.S., there have been no well designed prospective case controlled studies comparing the health outcomes of large groups of women who get influenza and pertussis containing Tdap vaccines during pregnancy either separately or simultaneously compared to those who do not get the vaccines, and no similar health outcome comparisons of their newborns at birth or in the first year of life have been conducted.  Safety and effectiveness evaluations that have been conducted are either small,32 retrospective,33, 34 compare vaccinated women to vaccinated women35 or have been performed by drug company or government health officials using unpublished data.36 FACT: The FDA has licensed Tdap vaccines to be given once as a single dose pertussis booster shot to individuals over 10 or 11 years old. The CDC's recommendation that doctors give every pregnant woman a Tdap vaccination during every pregnancy  regardless of whether a woman has already received one dose of Tdap  is an off-label use of the vaccine.37 FACT: Injuries and deaths from pertussis-containing vaccines are the most compensated claims in the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) and influenza vaccine injuries and deaths are the second most compensated claim.38 FACT: A 2013 published study evaluating reports of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) following vaccination in the U. S. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) and in a European vaccine reaction reporting system found that seasonal influenza vaccine was the most frequently suspected cause of brain inflammation after 18 years old, representing 32 percent of the total cases reported, and pertussis containing DTaP was among the vaccines most frequently associated with brain inflammation in children between birth and age five.39 FACT: When a pregnant woman is harmed by an influenza or Tdap vaccine, drug companies selling the vaccines in the U.S., doctors and other vaccine providers are shielded from vaccine injury lawsuits40 but it is unclear whether vaccine injuries sustained by an unborn child in the womb will qualify for federal vaccine injury compensation.41  Rush to Vaccinate: Policy Preceding Science  In addition to lack of credible scientific evidence to demonstrate safety,42, 43 there is not enough credible epidemiological and biological mechanism evidence to demonstrate it is effective or necessary44, 45, 46, 47 for every pregnant woman to get an influenza and Tdap shot during every pregnancy. The rush to vaccinate pregnant women and reach into the womb to try to passively vaccinate the developing fetus48, 49 is a clear case of policy preceding science. An experimental genetically engineered nanoparticle vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and another one for Group B Streptococcus are in advanced clinical trials and reportedly likely will be exclusively recommended for pregnant women after they are licensed.50 With new vaccines on the horizon that will target pregnant women, it is critically important that more bad vaccine policy does not precede good vaccine science. Pregnant women today need to take a long, hard look at the well advertised but theoretical benefits and unknown risks of getting vaccinated during pregnancy before making a vaccine decision. It is especially important when there are so many warning signs that America's highly vaccinated child and adult population in the 21st century is not very healthy. Maternal and infant mortality statistics are a classic measure of a nation's public health status and, in this country, here are red flags that cannot be ignored any longer.  Maternal and Infant Mortality Rates High in America  How many young couples of child bearing age know that women getting pregnant and delivering babies in America today have more than twice the risk of dying during pregnancy, childbirth or after giving birth than they did three decades ago?51, 52 Women having babies are dying of heart failure, high blood pressure and stroke, infection of the blood, diabetes and blood clots in greater numbers because the maternal death rate in America has been climbing since 1987.53   We now rank a dismal number 50 in maternal mortality in the world, which is worse than that of most European countries and some countries in Asia and the Middle East.54 Equally shocking is the fact that the U.S. now has the highest first day infant death rate of all industrialized countries55 and ranks number 31 among nations in infant mortality.56 Preterm birth rates have increased 36% since the early 1980s57 and 6 out of every 1,000 babies born alive in America die before their first birthday.58 Birth defects, chromosomal damage, premature birth, low birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome are the leading causes of death for about 23,000 newborn infants every year,59 with half of those deaths occurring on the first day of life. A baby born in America is twice as likely to die within the first 24 hours as babies born in the European Union.60  Why Is Health in the U.S. on Such A Steep Decline?  U.S. public health officials say there are ""no clear"" answers for why our maternal mortality rate is skyrocketing.61 They don't know why so many of our babies are dying on the first day and within the first year of life, in stark contrast to many other nations where maternal and infant mortality rates are declining. Public health officials also can't figure out why so many infants and children in America are plagued with brain and immune system problems. The unprecedented, unexplained chronic disease and disability epidemic62 has gotten worse in the past three decades  with 1 child in 6 now learning disabled;63 1 in 9 suffering with asthma;64 1 in 50 developing autism;65 1 in 400 becoming diabetic66 and millions more suffering with severe food allergies,67 inflammatory bowel disease68 and other chronic illness.69,70 The health of American adults has also deteriorated during the past three decades compared to other wealthy nations where health is improving71 and our life expectancy is worse than many other countries as well.72 The CDC says that today chronic diseases are the most common and costly causes of death and disability with about half of all adults living with at least one chronic illness.73  U.S. Number One Market for Drugs & Vaccines  What is not on the list of potential causes for this failing public health report card is lack of access to drugs and vaccines. With a population of 316 million people out of 7 billion people on the Earth, the U.S. spends nearly $3 trillion per year on health care74  more than any other nation in the world75, 76  and we consume 40 percent of all drugs sold globally.77, 78, 79 In addition, America is the leading purchaser of vaccines in the world's $32 billion vaccine market.80, 81, 82 Since 1981, 95 percent of all children entering kindergarten have received multiple doses of seven vaccines including pertussis and measles vaccines.83 In 1991, the CDC recommended all infants get a hepatitis B shot at 12 hours old84 and, by 2012, more than 70 percent of all newborns had received a hepatitis B shot at birth while between 80 and 90 percent of three year olds had gotten multiple doses of eleven vaccines.85 In a crusade to eliminate an expanding list of microbes, U.S. health officials currently direct pediatricians to give children 49 doses of 14 vaccines by age six starting on the day of birth with more than two dozen doses administered by an infant's first birthday.86 More than two dozen additional vaccinations are recommended or mandated for teenagers and adults, including annual flu shots throughout life.87  Has Mandated Use of More Vaccines Compromised America's Health?  Every state in the U.S. has laws requiring dozens of vaccinations for daycare and school attendance88 in contrast to neighboring Mexico and Canada, which recommend but do not mandate vaccines (a provision in Canada's Constitution prohibits compulsory vaccination).89 Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Iceland and Norway recommend but do not legally require vaccines and 15 countries in the European Union, including United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Greece, Denmark, Netherlands, Finland and Austria similarly recommend but do not mandate vaccines.90 All of these countries have lower infant mortality rates than the U.S. and do not recommend that infants under one year old get as many vaccines as American infants do.91   In fact, no other country legally requires92 the numbers of vaccinations that the U.S. does for children to attend daycare and school or for adults to keep their jobs.93 It is no wonder that more Americans are asking questions about why our children need so many vaccines and why adults need to get a flu shot every year  even during pregnancy  when our population is already the most vaccinated in the world but far less healthy than other countries that do not mandate or recommend so many vaccines.  Ask for the Science  If you are pregnant and have other children, be aware that the American Academy of Pediatrics is urging pediatricians to vaccinate parents bringing their children in for sick or well baby visits, especially pregnant women.94 If an obstetrician or pediatrician pressures you to get vaccinated while you are pregnant, ask the doctor to show you the science.95 If you conclude the vaccine's benefits do not outweigh the risks for you and your baby but are threatened or sanctioned in any way for making an informed choice, you should find another doctor who will treat you with respect and honor your health care choices.

Over-the-Counter Drugs May Double Your Risk of Miscarriage,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/10/04/alert-these-overthecounter-drugs-double-the-risk-of-miscarriage.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  It's estimated that between 10-25 percent of pregnancies result in miscarriage, and in most cases the cause is unknown, presenting a frustrating and heartbreaking scenario for many women who feel powerless to prevent a second or third miscarriage from occurring. There are, however, a growing number of factors that could play a role in your miscarriage risk, and one recently revealed is not only widespread but also very strongly correlated to miscarriage risk, so I wanted to bring it to the attention of those who may be newly pregnant or trying to conceive. Understanding this risk factor for miscarriage will give you a powerful way to take control of your pregnancy.  Avoid NSAIDS if You're Pregnant or Trying to Conceive  Many millions of Americans depend on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to relieve pain from arthritis, headaches, injuries and countless other conditions that cause chronic pain, but the drugs are among the most dangerous on the market. If you're pregnant, it's particularly imperative that you find another option for pain relief, as a new study found that taking non-aspirin NSAIDs in early pregnancy more than doubles your risk of miscarriage. The study involved both prescription and over-the-counter NSAIDs, all of which increased the risk of miscarriage when taken alone or in combination:  Diclofenac  Naproxen (Aleve)  Celecoxib (Celebrex)  Rofecoxib (Vioxx, now withdrawn)  Ibuprofen (Advil)   The researchers concluded:  ""Gestational exposure to any type or dosage of nonaspirin NSAIDs may increase the risk of spontaneous abortion. These drugs should be used with caution during pregnancy.""  Despite this finding, and the fact that other studies, including one published more than a decade ago, also have linked NSAIDs with an increased risk of miscarriage, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) 2011 Medication Guide for NSAIDs does not mention the potential risk. It does warn that pregnant women should not use NSAIDs late in pregnancy -- ibuprofen in the third trimester has been linked to heart problems in the baby, low amniotic fluid, and prolonged labor -- but this does nothing to warn and protect those who are newly pregnant. NSAIDs work by suppressing the production of prostaglandins (fatty acids needed for successful implantation of an embryo in the womb). Because NSAIDs and aspirin act on your whole body, they could lead to abnormal implantation that predisposes an embryo to miscarriage. The link is well established now, as still more research from 2003 found women who take NSAIDS or aspirin during pregnancy increase their risk of miscarriage by 80 percent.   Most Medications are Not Tested for Safety During Pregnancy   The truth is you need to be very careful when taking any drugs while you're pregnant. The nine months of development that take place in the womb are the most rapid and most vulnerable period of your baby's life. For this reason, it is generally best to avoid taking any medications unless absolutely necessary, including while you're trying to conceive, as you could become pregnant and not know it. Most medications have never been tested on pregnant women and their effects on a developing baby are completely unknown. Even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges that very little is known about the impacts of most medications on unborn babies:  ""We do not have enough information about the effects of many medications when they are taken by pregnant women  All prescription and over-the-counter medications are tested to see if they are safe and effective before they become available to the public. Pregnant women usually are not included in these tests because of the possible risks to the unborn baby.  As a result, little information is available about the safety of most medications during pregnancyincluding those available over the counterwhen they first become available.""   This is true even among drugs that are widely used by pregnant women. For instance, nearly 4 percent of pregnant women take antidepressants during their first trimester, even though a study last year -- by one of the same researchers who conducted the new NSAID study -- found they may increase your miscarriage risk by 68 percent. So it's best to use extreme caution with medications and only use those that are absolutely necessary.  More Reasons to Avoid NSAIDs (Even if You're Not Pregnant)  NSAIDs are not only dangerous to pregnant women and fetuses; they pose significant health risks to virtually everyone who takes them, and are particularly disastrous for your heart. You may be familiar with Vioxx, an NSAID pulled from the market in 2004 after 60,000 people died from its increased heart risks. Later that year, the FDA also warned that NSAIDS, such as Cox-2 inhibitors Bextra (which was pulled from the market in 2005) and Celebrex, as well as over-the-counter varieties like Aleve, Ibuprofen and aspirin, also lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular problems. A 2011 study by researchers at The University of Bern in Switzerland also revealed that NSAIDs lead to a two- to four-fold increase in your risk of heart attacks, stroke or cardiovascular death, noting that it would only take 25-50 patients being treated with NSAIDs for one year to lead to an additional heart attack or stroke. Aside from significantly increasing your heart risks, NSAIDs are linked to serious gastrointestinal risks, like bleeding of the digestive tract, increased blood pressure and kidney problems. Additionally, another class of prescription drugs, statins, which are used on tens of millions to lower cholesterol levels, should NEVER be taken in pregnancy as they are a Class X drug, which means they are virtually guaranteed to cause birth defects or miscarriage.  What are Some Non-Drug Options for Pain Relief During Pregnancy?  Medications only provide symptomatic relief and in no way, shape or form treat the underlying cause of your pain. So if you are suffering, I suggest you work with a knowledgeable health care practitioner to determine what's really triggering your pain, and then address the underlying cause. You don't need to suffer unnecessarily in the meantime, however; the following options provide excellent pain relief without any of the health hazards that medications carry:   Astaxanthin: One of the most effective oil-soluble antioxidants known. It has very potent anti-inflammatory properties and in many cases works far more effectively than many NSAIDs. Higher doses are typically required and one may need 8 mg or more per day to achieve this benefit.  Ginger: This herb is anti-inflammatory and offers pain relief and stomach-settling properties. Fresh ginger works well steeped in boiling water as a tea or grated into vegetable juice.  Curcumin: In a study of osteoarthritis patients, those who added 200 mg of curcumin a day to their treatment plan had reduced pain and increased mobility. A past study also found that a turmeric extract composed of curcuminoids (plant-based nutrients that contain powerful antioxidant properties) blocked inflammatory pathways, effectively preventing the launch of a protein that triggers swelling and pain.  Krill Oil: The omega-3 fats EPA and DHA contained in krill oil have been found by many animal and clinical studies to have anti-inflammatory properties useful for pain relief. They are also incredibly important during pregnancy.  Bromelain: This enzyme, found in pineapples, is a natural anti-inflammatory. It can be taken in supplement form but eating fresh pineapple may also be helpful.  Cetyl Myristoleate (CMO): This oil, found in fish and dairy butter, acts as a ""joint lubricant"" and an anti-inflammatory. I have used this for myself to relieve ganglion cysts and a mild annoying carpal tunnel syndrome that pops up when I type too much on non-ergonomic keyboards. I used a topical preparation for this.  Evening Primrose, Black Currant and Borage Oils: These contain the essential fatty acid gamma linolenic acid (GLA), which is useful for treating arthritic pain.  Cayenne Cream: Also called capsaicin cream, this spice comes from dried hot peppers. It alleviates pain by depleting the body's supply of substance P, a chemical component of nerve cells that transmits pain signals to your brain.  Methods such as yoga, acupuncture, meditation, hot and cold packs, and even holding hands can also result in astonishing pain relief without any drugs.    3 Tips for a Healthy Pregnancy  In addition to eating right and exercising regularly, you can give your baby the best start pre-, during and post-pregnancy by:  Making sure you keep your fructose level under 25 grams per day. There is powerful emerging evidence of the danger of excess fructose consumption. It will increase insulin and leptin resistance and also radically increase total inflammation in your body, which can cause pregnancy complications. So please be sure and count your fructose grams (it's often hidden in processed foods) and keep them below 25 grams per day.  Taking a high-quality, animal-based omega-3 fat, such as krill oil. As noted above, one of the most important dietary influences on your prenatal health is adequate omega-3 fats. Most women have major deficiencies of this fat, and given the statistics, it's very possible you do too.  Optimizing your omega-3 intake will not only virtually guarantee that your baby will be full term, but it is so essential to a child's development that if a mother and infant are deficient, the child's nervous system and immune system may never fully develop, and it can cause a lifetime of unexplained emotional, learning, and immune system disorders.  Optimizing your vitamin D levels. In the not too distant future I believe it will be mandatory for pregnant women to receive regular vitamin D blood tests. Along with reducing your risk of premature birth, studies have found that vitamin D may protect against a number of birth defects and autism.  It is absolutely imperative that pregnant women maintain a blood level of between 50 and 70 ng/ml of 25 hydroxy D. So please watch my free one-hour vitamin D lecture to find out how to get your levels optimized. Ideally you should get it by having UVB exposure on at least half of your skin. You can do this for free in the summer with sunlight but the rest of the year for many the next best option is a safe tanning bed. Your last option would be oral vitamin D, which will work but will not provide all of the benefits of the UVB skin exposure.

What You Should Know About Diarrhea During Pregnancy,http://articles.mercola.com/diarrhea/diarrhea-during-pregnancy.aspx,"Along with the usual discomforts during early pregnancy, such as morning sickness and heartburn, your digestive system can go haywire as well  it can slow down, making you constipated, or speed up, resulting in diarrhea. This is due to your increasing levels of hormones, particularly estrogen, progesterone and human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG).1,2 New food sensitivities, dietary changes, lactose intolerance and prenatal vitamins are some of the pregnancy-related causes of diarrhea. However, there are other culprits to blame for getting diarrhea when pregnant, which include the stomach flu, intestinal parasites, viruses, bacteria and food poisoning. Health conditions like irritable bowel syndrome, Crohns disease, celiac disease and ulcerative colitis may also be behind a nasty bout of diarrhea during pregnancy.3 Diarrhea can be one of the early symptoms of pregnancy, but it happens less in your second trimester. However, passing frequent loose stools is a pretty common visitor late in pregnancy.4,5 You May Experience Diarrhea in Your Third Trimester According to the American Pregnancy Association, you may find that diarrhea becomes more common as you near your due date: It could be a sign that labor is near, and it can occur right before labor or a couple of weeks before labor. If it is a couple of weeks before your due date, a premature birth should not be expected. This typically means your body is simply preparing itself for labor, but it doesnt necessarily mean that labor is imminent.6 Think of it as your bodys natural means of preparation and cleaning out impurities before your babys arrival. Take note that while some women may experience recurrent diarrhea in their third trimester, others will not.7 If you are passing at least three runny, watery bowel movements in one day, your main concern should be to stay hydrated, as you can quickly lose body fluids and get dehydrated, a major risk factor for premature labor.8,9 Severe dehydration can impede blood flow to the fetus,10 and may stimulate the uterus to contract.11 How to Deal With Diarrhea If You Are Pregnant If you are leery of medications while pregnant, the good news is that most cases of diarrhea will clear up in a few days, without treatment.12 While staying hydrated should be your priority, a few dietary changes can help alleviate this problem:  Replenish fluids and electrolytes your body has lost by consuming plenty of pure water (at least 80 ounces of water every day) and mineral-rich bone broth. Avoid food groups that can make diarrhea worse, such as spicy, high-fiber and high-fat foods.13 Do not consume sodas and processed drinks, which are high in sugar or artificial sweeteners that can disrupt your digestive system and worsen your diarrhea.14 Drink a half cup of water with some peppermint oil extract (two to three times a day).15  If your diarrhea doesnt clear up on its own after three days, or if you are experiencing symptoms, such as fever, abdominal pain, blood or mucus in the stool, signs of dehydration (dry mouth, decreased urine output, lightheadedness or dizziness), vaginal discharge, pressure in your pelvic area and cramps, call your doctor immediately.16,17 As a rule of thumb, diarrhea is not life-threatening, but it should not be taken lightly, especially while you are pregnant. < Previous Diarrhea In Kids Next > Diarrhea Duration   Previous Diarrhea In Kids   Next Diarrhea Duration [+] Sources and References      1Diet in Pregnancy, Digestive Problems during Pregnancy2The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, Problems of the Digestive System3,5,14Mom Junction, Diarrhea in Pregnancy: What Causes It And Remedies4,15PregMed.org, Diarrhea During Pregnancy6,8,12American Pregnancy Association, Diarrhea During Pregnancy7,13,17Healthline, Why Diarrhea Is Common During Pregnancy9What to Expect, Diarrhea During Pregnancy10Web Medicine Center, Diarrhea During Pregnancy11The Bump, Diarrhea During Pregnancy16Baby Center, Is It Normal to Have Diarrhea in Late Pregnancy?"

Trimester of Pregnancy is Crucial,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/08/23/trimester-pregnancy-affects-baby-health.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  The microbes that reside in your gut are very much a living, and integral, part of you. Far from being just passive bystanders, the bacteria are impacted by your health, your lifestyle and even your life stages  and they actively change in response to different periods of your life, like pregnancy.  Your Gut Microbes Change During Each Pregnancy Trimester to Support Fetal Growth  The composition of a woman's gut microbes actually changes during each trimester of pregnancy in ways that support the growth of the fetus. This is largely influenced by the hormonal shifts that occur during pregnancy.  Interestingly, for the first time, research has shown the microbes actually become less diverse and the number of beneficial bacteria decline while disease-related bacteria increase. Under normal circumstances, such changes could lead to weight gain and inflammation, but in pregnancy, they induce metabolic changes that promote energy storage in fat tissue so the fetus can grow.1 The study's lead author noted:2  ""The findings suggest that our bodies have coevolved with the microbiota and may actually be using them as a tool -- to help alter the mother's metabolism to support the growth of the fetus.""  The importance of gut flora continues during and after birth, and may have a profound influence on the baby's health and development. An article in Science Daily reported on the featured findings of one related study,3 stating:4  ""Each individual's community of gut microbes is unique and profoundly sensitive to environmental conditions, beginning at birth. Indeed, the mode of delivery during the birthing process has been shown to affect an infant's microbial profile. Communities of vaginal microbes change during pregnancy in preparation for birth, delivering beneficial microbes to the newborn.  At the time of delivery, the vagina is dominated by a pair of bacterial species, Lactobacillus and Prevotella. In contrast, infants delivered by caesarean section typically show microbial communities associated with the skin, including Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, and Propionibacterium. While the full implications of these distinctions are still murky, evidence suggests they may affect an infant's subsequent development and health, particularly in terms of susceptibility to pathogens.""  Interestingly, gut flora is not the only factor influenced by the method of birth. One recent study showed that vaginal birth triggers the expression of mitochondrial uncoupling protein 2 (UCP2) in mice, which is important for improving brain development and function in adulthood. The expression of this protein was impaired in mice born via caesarean section (C-section).5   Mom's Gut Bacteria Seriously Impacts Baby's Future Health  Microorganisms in your gastrointestinal tract form a highly intricate, living ""fabric"" that affects body weight, energy, and nutrition, among other factors.  Not only is each individual's community of gut microbes unique, but the groundwork for each person's gut flora is laid from birth. In fact, the mode of delivery during the birthing process has been shown to affect an infant's microbial profile. This is in part why it's so important for pregnant women to become mindful of their gut health, as it will affect not just their own health, but also that of their child.  The health implications of this variation in gut bacteria acquired from birth is exactly what Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride's research sheds light upon. Her research shows there's a profound dynamic interaction between your gut, your brain, and your immune system, starting from birth. She has developed what might be one of the most profoundly important treatment strategies for a wide range of neurological, psychological, and autoimmune disordersall of which are heavily influenced by your gut health.  I believe her Gut and Psychology Syndrome, and Gut and Physiology Syndrome (GAPS) Nutritional program is vitally important for MOST people, as the majority of people have such poor gut health due to poor diet and toxic exposures, but it's particularly crucial for pregnant women and young children.  According to Dr. Campbell-McBride, in children with GAPS, the toxicity flowing from their gut throughout their bodies and into their brains continually challenges their nervous system, preventing it from performing its normal function and process sensory information. GAPS may manifest in a wide range of symptoms, fitting the diagnosis of either autism, or attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), attention deficit disorder (ADD) without hyperactivity, dyslexia, dyspraxia, or obsessive-compulsive disorder, just to name a few possibilities... She explained:  ""What I see in the families of autistic children is that 100 percent of mom's of autistic children have abnormal gut flora and health problems related to that. But then I look at grandmothers on the mother's side, and I find that the grandmothers also have abnormal gut flora, but much milder.""   In essence, what we have is a generational build-up of abnormal gut flora, with each generation becoming ever more prone to being further harmed.  Download Interview Transcript  What Might be Putting Your Gut Flora at Risk?  If you've taken antibiotics or birth control pills, if you eat a lot of processed or sugary foods  even if you were bottle-fed as a baby, all of these can impact the makeup of bacteria and microbes in your gut. For instance, we now know that breastfed babies develop entirely different gut flora compared to bottle-fed babies. Infant formula never was, and never will be, a healthy replacement to breast milk, for a number of reasons -- altered gut flora being one of them.  Dr. Campbell-McBride discovered that a large percentage of the mothers of autistic children were bottle-fed. Then, as they received many courses of antibiotics throughout their childhood, the abnormalities in their gut flora further deepened.   ""Ever since antibiotics were prescribed, particularly from the 50s and 60s, they were prescribed for every cough and sneeze. They really over-prescribed antibiotics. And with every course of antibiotics, the abnormalities in the gut flora would get deeper and deeper in these girls. And then, at the age of 15, 16, these ladies were put on a contraceptive pill [which] have a devastating effect on the gut flora. Nowadays ladies are taking it for quite a few years before they're ready to start their family.""   So, to recap, bottle-feeding along with over-use of antibiotics and use of the contraceptive pill set the stage for increasingly abnormal gut flora with each passing generation. Then, add to that a diet of processed junk food and excessive consumption of fructose and other sugars and you have a prescription for disaster in terms of gastrointestinal health.  Dr. Campbell-McBride continued:  ""Many of these modern factors created a whole plethora of young ladies in our modern world who have quite deeply abnormal gut flora by the time they are ready to have their first child. This is the abnormal gut flora that they are passing through their children.  So these babies acquire abnormal gut flora from the start and while the baby is breastfed the baby is receiving protection because whatever is in the mother's blood will be in her milk. Women who have abnormal gut flora would have immune factors in their blood, which they have developed against their own gut flora to protect them. These immune factors will be in their milk.  While the baby is breastfed, despite the fact that the baby has acquired abnormal gut flora from the mom, there will be some protection. But as soon as the breastfeeding stops that protection stops as well. That is the time when the abnormalities in the gut flora really flourish and the child starts sliding down into autism or ADHD or ADD or any other learning disability or physical problems such as diabetes type 1, for example, and celiac disease or other autoimmune conditions, or asthma, eczema and other physical problems. That's where this epidemic comes from.""   If You're Pregnant, This is One of the Healthiest Types of Food to Eat  Maintaining optimal gut flora by eating raw food grown in healthy, organic soil and 'reseeding' your gut with fermented foods and probiotics (this is essential when you're taking an antibiotic), may be one of the most important steps you can take to improve your health and your baby's during pregnancy. If you aren't eating fermented foods, you most likely need to supplement with a probiotic on a regular basis, especially if you're eating a lot of processed foods.  If you're pregnant, however, I strongly recommend adding fermented foods to your diet. You can ferment virtually any food, and nearly every culture has traditionally fermented their foods to prevent spoilage. There are also many fermented beverages and yoghurts.  Fermenting your own foods is a fairly straightforward process. To learn more, please listen to my interview with Caroline Barringer, a Nutritional Therapy Practitioner (NTP) who has been involved with nutrition for about 20 years and is an expert in the preparation of the foods prescribed in Dr. Campbell-McBride's GAPS Nutritional Program.   Download Interview Transcript  What Can You do to Encourage Healthy Gut Flora Once Your Baby is Born?  Breastfeeding was designed by nature to ensure that your child's gut flora develops properly right from the start, as it is loaded both with beneficial bacteria and nutrient growth factors that will support their continued growth. It also has powerful components that will inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and yeast. So one of the most important foundational elements of building a healthy GI system for your child is to first eat a healthy diet with fermented foods while you're pregnant, and then breastfeed (whenever possible) for at least one year after your child is born. Providing abundant beneficial bacteria in the form of breast milk and, later, fermented foods is one of the most powerful ways to restore your baby's gut flora.  Once your baby is ready to start solid foods, the first fermented food Dr. Campbell-McBride recommends for your infant is raw organic grass-fed yogurt (not commercial yogurt from the grocery store), because it's well tolerated by most infants and children. It's best to make your own yogurt at home from raw organic milk, and start with a very tiny amount. Once yogurt is well tolerated by your baby, then start introducing kefir. If you have any problems with cow's milk, you can always try goat's milk or substitute vegetables fermented with yogurt culture or kefir culture.

Appendicitis During Pregnancy,http://articles.mercola.com/appendicitis/pregnancy.aspx,"Women are particularly more sensitive when they are expecting, as their body goes through many hormonal and physical changes. Certain types of pain are common during this period, particularly abdominal pain.    This is usually normal and is brought on by the expanding uterus, stretching of the ligaments and shifting of the organs. But in some cases, abdominal pain during pregnancy is brought on by certain health conditions  appendicitis is one of them.    Remember that having appendicitis while pregnant can be particularly dangerous both for you and your baby. This is why you should be on the lookout for this ailment and seek help immediately if you feel the symptoms of this ailment.    Incidence of Appendicitis in Pregnant Women  During pregnancy, appendicitis is the most common and non-obstetric emergency that may entail surgery. Its not a rare disorder and is seen in approximately 1 out of 1,500 pregnancies.1  It commonly happens during the second or third trimester, although it may also occur during the first trimester.    The appendicitis incidence rates range from 19 to 36 percent during the first trimester, 27 to 60 percent during the second trimester and 15 to 33 percent during the last three months of pregnancy.2   The incidence of appendicitis in women, is the same whether they are pregnant or not. However, pregnancy increases the risk of perforation.3   Whats alarming is that expectant mothers who have gone through an appendectomy are at a higher risk of fetal loss,4 especially if this condition occurs during early pregnancy and if the mother fails to receive appropriate medical attention immediately.5   Premature contractions and early labor may also be prompted by appendicitis, especially during the third trimester.6  This Condition May Be Mistaken as a Sign of Labor  The problem with accurately diagnosing appendicitis if youre pregnant is that the signs and symptoms are typically similar to those of pregnancy or the onset of labor. Aside from pain in the lower right abdomen, the most common symptoms include:7    Loss of appetite (anorexia)  Nausea  Vomiting   Fever and diarrhea are not common, although uterine contractions and painful or difficult urination (dysuria) may be felt. In some cases, the pain may be in the upper instead of lower right belly, because the appendix changes position during pregnancy.8  Appendicitis During This Delicate Period Must Be Addressed Immediately  If youre pregnant and are experiencing any of the symptoms above, have yourself (and your baby) checked immediately. If not diagnosed and treated promptly, appendicitis can lead to potentially dangerous side effects. This includes complications such as preterm labor, infection and risk of fetal or maternal loss. There is very low risk of the mother dying from appendicitis, though, with less than 2 percent succumbing to this illness. However, your infants health may be in jeopardy.    Those at a higher gestational age have a higher risk of perforation. If the appendix bursts during the third trimester, preterm labor might happen, and if no surgical intervention is done, the risk of fetal loss rises. The first week after the surgery is the riskiest, as it may lead to premature delivery  both the mother and unborn child should be closely monitored during this period.9  Previous Appendicitis in Children Next Appendicitis Duration   Previous Appendicitis in Children   Next Appendicitis Duration [+] Sources and References      1,6American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology, May 2000;182(5):1027-92,7,9The Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine, 2006;19(6):621-6263,4Motherisk, Appendicitis during pregnancy, March 20045Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica, Oct 1999;78(9):758-628Everyday Health, Symptoms of Appendicitis, July 22, 2014"
The Truth About Caffeine (Especially During Pregnancy),http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2008/01/02/truth-caffeine-pregnancy.aspx,
Why Pregnant Women Should Not Drink Coffee,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2014/02/03/coffee-in-pregnancy.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  In  recent years, research has emerged demonstrating that coffeein moderationmay  have a number of previously unrecognized health-promoting properties. As a result  of the rather impressive list of therapeutic benefits, I've modified my stance  on coffee. However, it's important to understand that coffee is both a  potent drug, and a whole food provided it's organically grown, and the drug  element of coffee can present problems for pregnant women.  Caffeine can significantly impact the growing fetus as it is  able to freely pass through the placenta, and since caffeine  does not provide any benefits to your  baby, only potential hazards, I strongly recommend pregnant women avoid ALL  forms of caffeine. Unfortunately, most people (pregnant or not) use coffee for its  energy-boosting properties, which ends up serving as a band-aid for poor  nutrition. If you're supplying your body with the nutrients it needs, you simply  won't need the extra energy boost.  If this sounds like you, you may want to consider taking a look at your  dietary habits. Proper nutrition clearly becomes even more important when  pregnant or planning a pregnancy.  Coffee in Pregnancy Tied to Smaller, Later Newborns  In a recent Norwegian study,1 which included data on nearly 60,000 women, coffee and other caffeinated  beverages increased the odds of delivering a low birth weight baby and/or  extended the gestation period.  Lead researcher Dr. Verena Sengpiel, an  obstetrician/gynecologist at the Sahlgrenska Academy of Sahlgrenska University  in Goteborg, Sweden, believes the current recommendations from the American  College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists should be re-evaluated. American  women are currently advised to limit their caffeine intake during pregnancy to  two cups of coffee per day.2 According to Dr. Sengpiel, this may be too much, even though  her observational study cannot prove a cause-and-effect between caffeine and  low birth weight. She told MedicineNet.com:   ""We cannot say from our data whether caffeine is the  specific substance responsible for the fetus being at greater risk of [becoming  a] low birth weight infant, nor did we study if these babies actually had  special health problems during the neonatal period.""   Still, higher caffeine consumption was found to be  associated with an increased risk for reduced birth weight. Every 100 mg of  caffeine consumed by the mother per day equated to a nearly one ounce reduction  in the baby's weight at birth. Every 100 mg of caffeine also increased the  length of the pregnancy by five hours. Interestingly, when the source of the  caffeine was coffee, the length of the pregnancy was extended by eight hours.  The reason for this difference is unknown. Seeing how your average cup of  coffee contains anywhere between 95-200 mg of caffeine, it may be best to err  on the side of caution. According to the featured article:3  ""Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician/gynecologist at Lenox Hill  Hospital in New York City, said, 'Other studies have indicated that  caffeine can affect fetal weight, so this is in accord with findings of other  studies.' Why caffeine might cause this effect is unclear, she said.   'We do know that caffeine crosses the placenta and the  baby is not able to metabolize it very well, [so] it may affect some of the  factors associated with growth,' Wu theorized. She advised that women  limit the amount of caffeine they consume during pregnancy. The World Health  Organization says 300 mg a day, but in the United States the recommended amount  is 200 mg a day, she added.""   Caffeine During Pregnancy May Damage Your Baby's Heart  Previous animal  research from 20094 found  that drinking the equivalent of just two cups of coffee while pregnant could be  enough to affect long-term heart function of the offspring. They also found  that this minimal exposure could lead to increased levels of body fat in males,  when compared to offspring not exposed to caffeine in the womb. Scott Rivkees,  Yale's Associate Chair of Pediatric Research and a senior researcher on the  study, told Medical News Today:5  ""Our studies raise  potential concerns about caffeine exposure during very early pregnancy, but further  studies are necessary to evaluate caffeine's safety during pregnancy.""  In the study,  mice given caffeine during pregnancy produced embryos with ""a thinner layer of  tissue separating some of the heart's chambers than the group that was not  given caffeine."" Long term, this resulted in a 20 percent increase in body fat  in males, and a 35 percent decrease in cardiac function. According to Gerald Weissman, M.D. and  editor-in-chief of the FASEB Journal:6   ""Caffeine is  everywhere: in what we drink, in what we eat, in pills that we use to relieve  pain, and even in candy... This report shows that despite popular notions of  safety, there's one place it probably shouldn't be: in the diet of an expectant  mother.""   When You're Eating for Two...  There is rarely a more nutritionally  demanding time during a woman's life than pregnancy (and later breastfeeding),  when your intake of nutrients from foods and supplements are needed not only to  keep your body running but also to nourish and support your rapidly growing baby.  Proper nutrition is crucial at all stages of fetal development, and if mom  doesn't eat right, her growing baby won't either. If  you're a woman in your childbearing years and you're planning to have children  any time soon, it's imperative that you start eating healthy now. Research7 published just last year showed that women who ate a vegetable-rich diet during  the year before pregnancy had a significantly lower risk of having a baby with  certain birth defects as women who ate an unhealthy high-sugar diet.  Specifically, compared to those who ate unhealthy, women on a healthy diet  experienced:  One-half  lower risk of anencephaly, a neural-tube defect that interferes with brain  development and often results in miscarriage  Up  to a one-third lower risk of cleft lip  One-quarter  lower risk of cleft palate  One-fifth  lower risk of spina bifida, another neural-tube defect   Unfortunately, the researchers lumped saturated  fats in with ""unhealthy fat,"" when they are actually crucial for  pregnant women (and everyone, for that matter), and incorrectly labeled whole  grains as healthy, when the majority of Americans need to limit them. So I  believe their results may have been skewed and may have shown an even greater benefit if a true  healthy diet had been defined.  Crucial Nutrients for Pregnant Women (and Women of Childbearing Age)  Healthy  nutrition cannot be limited to a handful of nutrients; it can only be achieved  by eating a variety of whole, high-quality foods daily. I cannot stress this  enough, as if you seek to make up for a diet of processed foods by taking a  multi-vitamin or eating a salad here and there, you are deceiving yourself and  missing the point -- and the benefits. For a  succinct and easy-to-follow overview of the types of foods and nutrients that  will support a healthy pregnancy, read my optimized nutrition plan.  Ideally, by the time you enter pregnancy you will already be in the Intermediate or Advanced stage, but even the Beginner  stage is far better that the typical American diet. As you'll see, it is  focused on minimizing processed foods while increasing your intake of  vegetables, healthy fats and high-quality sources of protein, all of which are  ideal for nurturing a growing fetus.  For  more detailed healthy pregnancy guidelines, please review my special report: ""No-Nonsense  Guide to a Naturally Healthy Pregnancy and Baby,"" which covers far more than  the basic nutrition tips offered here. Some of the highlights you'll want to be sure  to include though are:  Fermented Foods and/or Probiotics: Nearly everyone can  benefit from optimizing the balance of good vs. bad bacteria in their gut using  probiotics, but if you are pregnant or planning to be, this is of utmost  importance to you and your new baby. One of the best ways to do this is to  avoid sugar and processed foods and to include fermented foods in your diet.   Research shows giving pregnant women and newborns doses of good bacteria can:  Radically reduce the risk of developing autism or autism like disorders Protect babies from developing eczema in childhood Help prevent childhood allergies;8Help optimize your baby's weight later in life;9 Improve the symptoms of colic, decreasing average crying times by about 75  percent;10 reduce your risk of premature labor The best way to ensure optimal gut flora is to regularly consume traditionally  fermented foods, which are naturally rich in probiotics. This includes Lassi,  kefir, sauerkraut and other fermented veggies, natto, kim chee, and tempeh. A  high-quality probiotic supplement is also an option, especially if you don't  eat many fermented foods. Vitamin D: I've included vitamin  D here even though your main source of it should be from the sun, not from food. Along  with reducing your risk of premature birth, studies have found that vitamin D  may protect against a number of birth defects and autism, as well as pregnancy  complications like high  blood pressure. It is absolutely imperative that pregnant women maintain a  blood level of between 50 and 70 ng/ml of 25 hydroxy D, and I am hopeful  that in the not too distant future it will be mandatory for pregnant women to  receive regular vitamin D blood test levels. Vitamin B12: Vitamin B12 is one of  the eight B complex vitamins and is naturally present in foods that come from  animals, including meat, fish, eggs, milk and milk products. B12 is critical  for normal neurological development and maintenance, and shortages can result in permanent birth defects. Note: If you eat a vegan diet, you are  likely to be dangerously  deficient in vitamin B12. Folate in the form of Metafolate: Another B complex vitamin (vitamin B9), folic acid deficiency at the time of conception is known  to increase the risk for birth defects such as spina bifida.Many women are aware of this and take folic acid supplements in their prenatal  vitamins, but many are not aware that in order for folic acid to perform its crucial duties in your body, and for your fetus, it must first be activated into the biologically active  form  L-5-MTHF. This is the form that's most usable by your body and the form  that's able to cross the blood-brain barrier to carry out important brain  functions. Nearly half of the population has difficulty converting folic acid to the bioactive 5-MTHF form because of a genetic reduction in enzyme activity, so it's important to look for metafolate or metafolin in your multi-vitamin  instead of folic acid.Be sure to read the label closely, as many companies  don't use the bioactive form because it is too expensive and about 10 times  more costly.Of course even better than a supplement would be a wide variety of healthy,  fresh, organically grown vegetables, which will supply not only folic acid in  the correct form but all the other important accessory micronutrients. Animal-Based Omega-3 Fats: Most women have major  deficiencies of animal-based omega-3  fat like EPA and DHA, which is unfortunate because fetal cells cannot form  omega-3 fats, meaning a fetus must obtain all of its omega-3 fatty acids  from mother's diet. A mother's dietary intake and plasma concentrations of  DHA directly influence the DHA status of the developing fetus.    DHA (docosahexaenoic acid) is so essential to a child's development that if a  mother and infant are deficient in it, the child's nervous system and immune  system may never fully develop, and it can cause a lifetime of unexplained  emotional, learning, and immune system disorders. DHA makes up 15 percent to 20  percent of the cerebral cortex and 30 percent to 60 percent of the retina so it  is absolutely necessary for normal development of the fetus in utero, and  as a baby post birth.  Studies have shown that sufficient levels of omega-3 fats optimize brain growth  in children, especially during the third trimester. But because the fetus  depends on the mother's DHA sources, the constant drain on a mother's DHA  reserves can easily lead to a deficiency and some researchers believe that  preeclampsia (pregnancy-related high blood pressure) and postpartum depression  could be linked to a DHA deficiency. The DHA in animal-based omega-3 fats will  also help to prevent the vast majority of premature deliveries.   If You're NOT Pregnant, Keep These Coffee Drinking Tips in Mind  Getting  back to coffee, I believe there are ways to include coffee in a healthy  lifestyle, provided you're not using it as a crutch to mask symptoms of a poor  diet, resulting in flagging energy levelsand provided you're not pregnant. To learn more, see this previous article on the health benefits of coffee. That said, another major caveat to  coffee drinking is quality. You can  find a great deal of information at Coffee & Conservation.11  Here are five primary considerations to follow if you want to use coffee for  its therapeutic benefits:  Choose Organic: Coffee beans are one of the most heavily sprayed crops. So, you should select only coffee  beans that are certified organic and hence grown without pesticides. This is  important, as you will obliterate ANY positive effects if you consume coffee  that's been doused in pesticides or other chemicals. Whenever possible,  purchase sustainable ""shade-grown"" coffee to help prevent the  continued destruction of our tropical rain forests and the birds that inhabit  them. There are many who say shade grown coffee tastes better as well.  Whole Bean: You'll want to  purchase whole bean coffee that smells and tastes fresh, not stale; if your  coffee does not have a pleasant aroma, it is likely rancid. Grind it yourself to  prevent rancidity as pre-ground coffee may be rancid by the time you get it  home.  Drink It Black: If you're interested  in the health benefits, drink your coffee black, without sugar or cream or  flavorings. Add sugar and you'll certainly ruin any of the benefits by spiking  your insulin levels, which contributes to insulin resistance. Make sure the  water you're using is pure.  Coffee Filters: If you use a  ""drip"" coffee maker, be sure to use non-bleached filters. The bright  white ones are chlorine-bleached, and some of this chlorine will leach from the  filter during the brewing process. Bleached filters are also notoriously full  of dangerous disinfection byproducts, such as dioxin.  Coffee Mugs: Be careful about  the container you use. Avoid plastic cups as the BPA will leach into your drink. Styrofoam cups can also leach chemicals. Your best  bets include glass and ceramic travel mugs.   Again, remember that while coffee has the potential to be  used therapeutically, you need to view it as both a drug and a whole food. As  other drugs, caffeine can have a potent impact and should be respected and used  with caution. As a whole food, it needs to fulfill certain criteria. Much of  the commercial coffee available can be likened to ""junk food"" in that it's  loaded with pesticide residues and otherwise of poor quality... The most important caveat is to avoid coffee and other sources of caffeine during pregnancy. There  are far too many contraindications during this time, and plenty of evidence  that it can cause long-term harm.If you feel like you cannot drag yourself into work without one or more  cups of coffee, you may want to address your diet and exercise, which is at the  root of your fatigue. If you're supplying your body with the nutrients it  needs, you simply won't need the extra energy boost.

Taking Antibiotics During Pregnancy Is a Bad Idea,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2012/12/06/antibiotics-during-pregnancy.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  According to recent research1 from Denmark, children whose mothers took antibiotics during their pregnancy were more likely to develop asthma, compared to those whose mother did not take antibiotics. Taking other risk factors into account, the researchers estimated that children exposed to antibiotics were 17 percent more likely to be hospitalized for asthma before the age of five. Furthermore, children who were predisposed to asthma due to their mother having the condition were twice as likely to develop asthma if their mother used antibiotics during the third trimester, compared to those whose mother did not use antibiotics.  While the study doesn't prove causation (they cannot tell whether the asthma was the result of the antibiotic or the infection itself), the increased asthma risk found does support the theory that probiotics  beneficial bacteria residing in your gut, which are decimated by antibiotics  play a role in the development of asthma. Co-author Dr. Hans Bisgaard told Reuters Health2:   ""We speculate that mothers' use of antibiotics changes the balance of natural bacteria, which is transmitted to the newborn, and that such unbalanced bacteria in early life impact on the immune maturation in the newborn.""   Indeed, one of the most important prerequisites for your newborn is establishing a healthy gastrointestinal tract. Regardless of age, your gut is your first line of defense in terms of immunity. Without a well-functioning GI tract, your child will not get the proper nourishment to grow, or defend himself against pathogens of all types.  The baby gets his or her first ""inoculation"" of gut flora from the mother's birth canal during childbirth, which is why a mother's use of antibiotics during pregnancy can predispose the child to asthma and a variety of other ailments.It's important to understand that if a mother'sflora is abnormal,her baby's flora will also be abnormal, as whatever organisms live in her vagina end up coatingher baby's body and lining his or her intestinal tract.  The Importance of Gut Health During Pregnancy  Unfortunately, studies show that a growing number of women have unknown vaginal infections at childbirth, which can result in the passage of abnormal microflora onto their babies. This introduction of unfriendly flora, combined with antibiotic use, can predispose a baby to GAPS (Gut and Psychology Syndrome, and also Gut and Physiology Syndrome). GAPS can have very damaging long-term effects on a child's health, both neurologically and physiologically, predisposing him or her to:    Autism, ADHD/ADD and learning disabilities, such as dyslexia  Arthritis  Asthma and allergies    Mood disorders, such as depression and bipolar disorder  Skin problems  Kidney problems    Schizophrenia  Digestive ailments  Autoimmune disorders      GAPS may have profound implications for the autism epidemic. Rates of childhood autism are staggering, now 50 times higher in some areas than three decades ago. Not surprisingly, there is a matching epidemic of GAPS. Dr. Natasha Campbell-McBride is a neurologist and neurosurgeon who has devoted years of her career to studying this phenomenon, and how to treat and prevent it. To learn more, please listen to the interview featured in my previous article How a Physician Cured Her Son's Autism.  In this follow-up interview, she discusses the physiological aspect of GAPS, and its impact on autoimmune disease and allergies.   Download Interview Transcript  Antibiotic Resistance Major Public Health Problem  The frivolous use of antibiotics, not just in medicine, but also in food production, is the root cause of skyrocketing antibiotic resistance. Data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control3 (ECDC) shows a significant rise of resistance to multiple antibiotics in Klebsiella pneumoniae and E. coli in just the last four years alone, affecting more than one-third of the EU. According to a recent report by Medical News Today4:  ""In several of the member states, between 25 and over 60 percent of K pneumoniae from bloodstream infections show combined resistance to multiple antibiotics.... The ECDC data shows that consumption of carbapenems, a major class of last-line antibiotics, went up significantly in EU/EEA countries between 2007 and 2010. The report suggests this is most likely due to increasing multidrug resistance in Gram-negative infections, such as pneumonia or bloodstream infections, which are often treated with carbapenems.""  November 18 was European Antibiotic Awareness Day5. The UK issued an informational leaflet6 to raise awareness about the need for judicious use of antibiotics, urging patients to not ask their doctors for an antibiotic to treat symptoms of cold and flu, as antibiotics do not work on infections caused by viruses. Americans also need to heed this advice, as a recent poll shows many Americans are still a bit clueless about antibiotics and antibiotic resistance.  As reported by MedicineNet.com7:  ""[A]lthough almost 90 percent of Americans know that antibiotics are effective for treating bacterial infections, more than a third also erroneously believed the drugs can fight viral infections such as the common cold or the flu...   'It's a common misperception that antibiotics can cure the common cold, and unnecessary overuse of antibiotics for illnesses like colds is dumping fuel on a wildfire of resistance,"" said Dr. Lauri Hicks, medical director of the 'Get Smart: Know When Antibiotics Work' program at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.... Many participants wrongly believed that individuals build up tolerance to antibiotics, when it is the bacteria themselves that become resistant.'     Rise in Antibiotic Resistance is Alarming  Between the years of 1993 and 2005, the number of Americans hospitalized due to the antibiotic-resistant ""superbug"" MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) skyrocketed from about 2,000 to 370,000. Currently, MRSA and other antibiotic-resistant infections kill about 60,000 Americans annually, and account for billions of dollars in health care costs8. According to many health experts, antibiotic-resistance is one of our greatest health threats, and it's really all our own doing. When used properly, in the correct contexts and with responsibility, antibiotics can and do save lives that are threatened by bacterial infections. But there is one important variable that wasn't considered when the widespread use of these ""miracle medicines"" began, and that is that bacteria are highly adaptable. They are clearly capable of outsmarting antibiotics, and they are doing so with a vengeance. According to the CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System9:  ""Antibiotics kill or inhibit the growth of susceptible bacteria. Sometimes one of the bacteria survives because it has the ability to neutralize or evade the effect of the antibiotic; that one bacteria can then multiply and replace all the bacteria that were killed off.   Exposure to antibiotics therefore provides selective pressure, which makes the surviving bacteria more likely to be resistant. In addition, bacteria that were at one time susceptible to an antibiotic can acquire resistance through mutation of their genetic material or by acquiring pieces of DNA that code for the resistance properties from other bacteria.The DNA that codes for resistance can be grouped in a single easily transferable package. This means that bacteria can become resistant to many antimicrobial agents because of the transfer of one piece of DNA.""  The Rise of ""Superbugs""...  Bacteria are, in essence, hard-wired to adapt to threats such as antibiotics and, as such, there has been talk that the ""end of antibiotics"" is near. At that point, infections that were once easily treated will undoubtedly return with renewed force. Casualties are to be expected... Numerous bacteria are already resistant to many commonly prescribed antibiotics10, including:    Acinetobacter: A bacteria found in soil and water that often causes infections in seriously ill hospital patients.  Anthrax: Spread by infected animals or potentially bioterrorist weapons.  Group B streptococcus: A common bacteria in newborns, the elderly and adults with other illnesses.    Klebsiella pneumonia: A bacteria that can lead to pneumonia, bloodstream infections, wound and surgical site infections and meningitis.  Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA): A superbug that can be so difficult to treat, it can easily progress from a superficial skin infection to a life-threatening infection in your bones, joints, bloodstream, heart valves, lungs, or surgical wounds.  Neisseria meningitides: One of the leading causes of bacterial meningitis in children and young adults.    Shigella: An infectious disease caused by Shigella bacteria.  Streptococcus pneumoniae: A leading cause of pneumonia, bacteremia, sinusitis, and acute otitis media (AOM).  Tuberculosis (TB): Both ""multi-drug resistant"" and ""extensively drug-resistant"" forms of TB are now being seen.    Typhoid fever: A life-threatening illness caused by the Salmonella Typhi bacteria.  Vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE): Infection with the enteroccocci bacteria that often occurs in hospitals and is resistant to vancomycin, an antibiotic.  Vancomycin-Intermediate/Resistant Staphylococcus aureus (VISA/VRSA): Various strains of staph bacteria that are resistant to vancomycin.      Two of the latest drug-resistant infections are gonorrhea and tuberculosis. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), the first reports of extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis began surfacing in 200611. WHO now also recognizes drug-resistant gonorrhea as ""an emergency."" Earlier this summer, Wired Magazine12 reported on the issue:  ""Millions of people with gonorrhoea may be at risk of running out of treatment options unless urgent action is taken, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Already several countries, including Australia, France, Japan, Norway, Sweden and the United Kingdom are reporting cases of resistance to cephalosporin antibiotics  the last treatment option against gonorrhoea. Every year an estimated 106 million people are infected.""  Your Dietary Choices Also Contribute to Rising Antibiotic Resistance  Compounding the problem is the fact that antibiotics are also widely over-used in agriculture. In fact, agricultural uses account for about 70 percent of all antibiotic use in the US, so it's a MAJOR source of human antibiotic consumption. Animals are often fed antibiotics at low doses for disease prevention and growth promotion, and those antibiotics are transferred to you via meat, and even via the manure used as crop fertilizer.  Reducing the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is yet another reason for making sure you're only eating grass-fed, organically-raised meats.  What You Can Do to Help Stop the Spread of Antibiotic-Resistant Disease  You can help yourself and your community by using antibiotics only when absolutely necessary and by purchasing organic, antibiotic-free meats and other foods. We're all in this fight against antibiotic-resistant bacteria together, and the more people who get involved on a personal level to stop unnecessary antibiotic use the better. Avoiding all unnecessary antibiotics is an important step that I urge everyone to take, even though ultimately the problem of antibiotic-resistance needs to be stemmed through public policy on a nationwide level. If you live in the United States and want to get involved on a national level, Food Democracy Now! has created a petition against the overuse of antibiotics in livestock production13. If you care about this issue, I suggest you use this petition to make your voice heard. Also, to bring us back to the first featured story, please make sure to avoid unnecessary use of antibiotics during pregnancy. Not every bacterial infection needs to be treated with a drug. First, as an all-around preventive measure, you'll want to make sure your vitamin D level is optimized year-round, especially during pregnancy, along with vitamin K2. But there are also a number of natural compounds that act as broad-based antibiotics/anti-virals that you can try first, such as:  Oregano Garlic  Echinacea  Manuka honey (for topical application) [+] Sources and References      1The Journal of Pediatrics, Published Online November 8, 2012 2Reuters Health November 19, 2012 3European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control  4Medical News Today November 19, 2012 5European Antibiotic Awareness Day 6Antibiotic Information Leaflet 7MedicineNet.com November 13, 2012 8See ref 79CDC's National Antimicrobial Resistance Monitoring System 10CDC, Antibiotic Resistance 11WHO, Drug Resistant Tuberculosis 12Wired Magazine June 6, 2012 13Food Democracy Now!

Top Foods to Eat When You're Pregnant,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2015/11/02/top-pregnancy-foods.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  There is rarely a more nutritionally demanding time during a woman's life than pregnancy (and later breastfeeding), when your intake of nutrients from foods and supplements are needed not only to keep your body running, but also to nourish and support your rapidly growing baby.   Proper nutrition is crucial at all stages of fetal development (and even before conception), and if mom doesn't eat right, her growing baby won't either. For a succinct and easy-to-follow overview of the types of foods and nutrients that will support a healthy pregnancy, read my optimized nutrition plan.

As you'll see, it is focused on minimizing processed foods while increasing your intake of vegetables, healthy fats, and high-quality sources of protein, all of which are ideal for nurturing a growing fetus.   If you're wondering about specific foods, see below for some of the top superfoods to eat when you're pregnant.  10 Top Foods to Eat When You're Pregnant   1. Vitamin D   Vitamin D isn't a food but rather is made by your body in response to sunlight exposure. It's so important, however, that it deserves to be number one on this list.   Raising vitamin D levels among pregnant women is of particular concern, as deficiency affects not only the mother, increasing her risk of complications during pregnancy or delivery, but also has short- and long-term ramifications for her child's health.   I firmly believe optimizing your vitamin D during pregnancy is one of the most important things you can do for the health of your child. When a child is born deficient in vitamin D, his or her health can be significantly affected in any number of ways.  Research confirms there is a lifelong impact of vitamin D deficiency in pregnancy ranging from childhood allergies to asthma, colds and flu, dental cavities, diabetes, and even strokes and cardiovascular disease in later life of the child.   Further, each year, more than half a million preemies are born, and it's the number one killer of newborns. It's also the second leading cause of death among children under the age of five. Research shows that vitamin D could likely prevent half of all these premature births.  It can also cut your risk of preeclampsia, gestational diabetes, and prenatal infections by approximately 50 percent. Among African-American and Hispanic populations, approximately 70 to 75 percent of all preterm births could be prevented with vitamin D optimization. Vitamin D screening is key.  This is the only way to determine whether you might be deficient or not, and regular testing is important to make sure whatever dosage of vitamin D you're taking is sufficient to reach clinically relevant levels. GrassrootsHealth, which has a panel of 42 researchers who provide scientific evidence, recommends maintaining a vitamin D blood serum level of 40 to 60 ng/ml to protect your and your baby's health.  However, according to previous studies, your levels need to be above 50 ng/ml to protect your baby from serious complications, such as premature delivery and preeclampsia.1 So please, if you're pregnant, make sure to get your 25-hydroxy D levels checked.  While optimizing your vitamin D through sensible sun exposure is best, if this isn't possible Dr. Bruce Hollis' research indicates that 50 percent of women can achieve this level with 4,000 IUs daily during pregnancy and 6,400 IUs (for nursing mothers) of vitamin D3 on a daily basis. Again, you'll need to have your vitamin D levels tested to be sure you're within the optimal range.  2. Organic Free-Range Eggs   Eggs are a phenomenal source of protein, fat, and other nutrients, including choline and the antioxidants lutein and zeaxanthin. In pregnant women, choline plays an important role helping to prevent certain birth defects, such as spina bifida, and playing a role in brain development.   Prior research has concluded that choline intake during pregnancy ""super-charged"" the brain activity of animals in utero, indicating that it may boost cognitive function, improve learning and memory, and even diminish age-related memory decline and the brain's vulnerability to toxins during childhood, as well as conferring protection later in life.2  Consumption of higher levels of choline during pregnancy (about double the recommended pregnancy intake) is linked to beneficial epigenetic changes in the fetus, including protection from stress-related and metabolic disorders, that likely last into adulthood.3  3. Wild-Caught Alaskan or Sockeye Salmon, Sardines    Fish has always been the best source for the animal-based omega-3 fats EPA and DHA, but as levels of pollution have increased you have to be very choosy about which types of seafood you decide to eat  especially when you're pregnant.  If you're not careful, the toxic effects from the pollutants in the fish will outweigh the benefits of the omega-3 fats. Among the safest in terms of contamination, and the highest in healthy omega-3 fat, is wild-caught Alaskan and sockeye salmon.   Neither is allowed to be farmed, and are therefore always wild-caught. The risk of sockeye accumulating high amounts of mercury and other toxins is reduced because of its short life cycle, which is only about three years.   Additionally, bioaccumulation of toxins is also reduced by the fact that it doesn't feed on other, already contaminated, fish. The two designations you want to look for on the label are: ""Alaskan salmon"" (or wild Alaskan salmon) and ""Sockeye salmon.""   Canned salmon labeled ""Alaskan salmon"" is also a reasonable choice and offers a less expensive alternative to salmon fillets. A general guideline is that the closer to the bottom of the food chain the fish is, the less contamination it will have accumulated, so other safer choices include smaller fish like sardines, anchovies, and herring.   Sardines, in particular, are one of the most concentrated sources of omega-3 fats. They also contain a wealth of other nutrients, from vitamin B12 and selenium to protein, calcium, and choline, making them one of the best dietary sources of animal-based omega-3s. You can also supplement your diet with animal-based omega-3s by taking a krill oil supplement.   4. Full-Fat Grass-Fed Dairy   Whole dairy products made from grass-fed raw milk are a rich source of healthy fats, protein, calcium, B vitamins, magnesium, zinc, phosphorus, and more. Grass-fed raw butter, milk, and cheese from high-quality sources are all beneficial. Raw organic milk from grass-fed cows not only contains beneficial bacteria that prime your immune system and can help reduce allergies, it's also an outstanding source of vitamins (especially vitamin A), zinc, enzymes, and healthy fats. Your absolute best bet when it comes to yogurt is to make your own using a starter culture and raw grass-fed milk, which you combine and leave at room temperature overnight.  By the time you wake up in the morning, you will likely have kefir (fermented milk). If it hasn't obtained the consistency of yogurt, you might want to set it out a bit longer and then store it in the fridge. If you want to sweeten up your homemade yogurt naturally, try adding in some whole berries or dried (unsweetened) coconut.    5. Sweet Potatoes   Orange-colored sweet potatoes owe their appearance to the carotenoid beta-carotene. As an antioxidant, beta-carotene can help ward off free radicals that damage cells through oxidation, which can speed up aging and make you vulnerable against chronic diseases.   This antioxidant can help support your immune system, as well as lower your risk of heart disease and cancer. It's also very important during pregnancy, as it's converted into vitamin A in your body.   Vitamin A is essential for fetal health and development, but high levels of animal-based vitamin A may cause toxicity, making beta-carotene an ideal alternative. Sweet potatoes are also an excellent source of fiber, which can help support healthy blood sugar levels and improve digestion.   6. Broccoli and Leafy Greens  Broccoli and dark green leafy vegetables like spinach and kale are loaded with important nutrients for pregnant women, including folate, fiber, potassium, calcium, iron, and vitamins C, K, and A. Their rich antioxidant content will also support your immune system health and digestion, while their fiber can help prevent constipation, which is a common problem in pregnant women.  7. Grass-Fed Beef and Pasture-Raised Chicken   Grass-fed beef is an excellent source of protein and other nutrients in high demand during pregnancy, like iron, choline, and B vitamins. Chicken is an excellent source of protein, B vitamins, selenium, phosphorus, and choline. It provides all B vitamins along with a surprisingly varied number of additional nutrients.   8. Berries  Berries contain concentrated amounts of the disease-fighting phytochemicals found to boost your immunity, prevent cancer, protect your heart, and prevent seasonal allergies. Berries are lower in sugar than many fruits, so they are less likely to destabilize your insulin levels. Berries also contain high amounts of vitamin C, which will help your body absorb iron, and a good amount of fiber.  9. Avocados  Avocados provide close to 20 essential health-boosting nutrients, including potassium, vitamin E, vitamin K, B vitamins, and folate. They're also one of few foods that contain significant levels of both vitamins C and E and are an excellent source of healthy monounsaturated fat. Avocados are even high in fiber, with about 4.6 grams in half an avocado. Fiber plays an essential role in your digestive, heart, and skin health, and may improve blood sugar control, and more, so when you eat avocados you're really providing your body  and your baby  with a comprehensive package of nutrition.  10. Chia Seeds  Chia seeds are a quick and easy-to-use source of protein, healthy fats, dietary fiber, minerals, vitamins, and antioxidants, all rolled into one neat package. Although they have similar health benefits to flax seeds, chia seeds may soon edge these out because they don't have to be ground prior to consumption, and they don't go rancid as quickly either. Their high concentration of the plant-based omega-3 fat alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) is one of their major claims to fame. Chia seeds contain up to 40 percent oil, with 60 percent comprised of plant-based omega-3.4   New Benefits Revealed for a High-Fiber Diet During Pregnancy  A fiber-rich diet is recommended for most adults, but ramping up your fiber intake may be especially beneficial during pregnancy. Researchers from the Department of Immunology at Monash University in Australia revealed that a high-fiber diet may beneficially alter a woman's gut bacteria during pregnancy, producing anti-inflammatory substances that suppress asthma-related genes in her baby.5,6 Mounting research also suggests that a high-fiber diet can help reduce your risk of premature death from any cause, likely because it helps to reduce your risk of a number of chronic diseases.  This includes type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and cancer. Studies have also linked a high-fiber diet to beneficial reductions in blood pressure, improved insulin sensitivity, and reduced inflammation  all of which can benefit your baby. The best way to increase your fiber intake during pregnancy is to focus on eating more vegetables, nuts, and seeds. The following whole foods, for example, contain high levels of both soluble and insoluble fiber.     Psyllium seed husk, flax hemp, and chia seeds  Berries  Vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts    Root vegetables and tubers, including onions, sweet potatoes, and jicama Almonds Peas   Green beans Cauliflower Beans    Gaining Too Much Weight During Pregnancy Linked to Children's Obesity   Healthy weight gain is important and expected during pregnancy, but women who are overweight before pregnancy, and those who gain too much weight while pregnant, may be putting their babies at risk of childhood obesity. Researchers followed more than 700 women who returned for follow up with their children were 7 years old. Children of mothers who had been overweight prior to pregnancy were more likely to be overweight.   Women with greater weight gain during pregnancy were also more likely to have children with a higher percentage of body fat, and those with excessive weight gain were nearly three times more likely to have obese children than those who did not gain weight excessively during pregnancy.7 The Institute of Medicine recommends women of average weight gain 25 to 35 pounds during pregnancy, while overweight women should gain 15 to 25 pounds and obese women gain just 11 to 20 pounds.8   More Risks Revealed for Lack of Vitamin D During Pregnancy  From my perspective, it is simply reprehensible malpractice for a health care professional to fail to address your vitamin D level if you're pregnant  it's just that important. For pregnant women, optimizing your vitamin D is even more important for your child's health and development than folate, which is routinely recommended for pregnant women.  Recent research shed even more light on what's at stake if your vitamin D levels are low during pregnancy. One study revealed that women with low levels of vitamins D and E in early pregnancy are associated with an increased risk of asthma in her child within the first 10 years of life.9 Separate research found newborns of mothers whose diets were deficient in vitamins D and E had airway cells that reacted more to irritants and allergens.10 This may, in turn, impact the development of asthma or allergies later in life. Separate research also added to past data linking low vitamin D levels during pregnancy with premature birth. Women with the lowest levels of vitamin D were 1.5 times more likely to deliver early than those with the highest levels, perhaps because vitamin D helps reduce bacterial infection in the placenta, which may trigger early delivery.11 Along with reducing your risk of premature birth, studies have found that vitamin D may protect against a number of birth defects and autism, as well as pregnancy complications like high blood pressure. It is absolutely imperative that pregnant women maintain a blood level of between 50 and 70 ng/ml of 25-hydroxy D, and I am hopeful that in the not too distant future it will be mandatory for pregnant women to receive regular vitamin D blood test levels.   Dad's Diet Matters for Baby's Health, Too  It's not only mom's diet that influences the future health of her offspring. A father's diet prior to conception may also play a role, particularly in regard to folate. An animal study showed that paternal folate deficiency was associated with an increase in birth defects in offspring compared to fathers eating a folate-sufficient diet. There was, in fact, a nearly 30 percent increase in birth defects, including severe skeletal abnormalities, among litters sired by fathers who were deficient in folate. The Epoch Times reported:12   ""The research shows that there are regions of the sperm epigenome that are sensitive to life experience and particularly to diet. And that this information is in turn transferred to a so-called epigenomic map that influences development and may also influence metabolism and disease in the offspring in the long term. The epigenome is like a switch, which is affected by environmental cues, and is involved in many diseases including cancer and diabetes.   The epigenome influences the way that genes are turned on or off and hence how heritable information gets passed along. Although it has been known for some time that there is a massive erasure and re-establishment that takes place in the epigenome as the sperm develops, this study shows that along with the developmental map, the sperm also carries a memory of the father's environment and possibly even of his diet and lifestyle choices.""   If You're Planning to Have Children, the Time to Start Eating Right Is Now   If you're a woman (or a man) in your childbearing years and you're planning to have children any time soon, it's imperative that you start eating healthy now. Research published in 2013 showed that women who ate a vegetable-rich diet during the year before pregnancy had a significantly lower risk of having a baby with certain birth defects compared to women who ate an unhealthy high-sugar diet.13 Specifically, compared to those who ate unhealthy, women on a healthy diet experienced:  One-half  lower risk of anencephaly, a neural-tube defect that interferes with brain  development and often results in miscarriage  Up  to a one-third lower risk of cleft lip  One-quarter  lower risk of cleft palate  One-fifth  lower risk of spina bifida, another neural-tube defect   Finally, one additional food group that hasn't yet been mentioned, but is crucially important for pregnant women, is fermented foods. Nearly everyone can benefit from the beneficial microbes in fermented vegetables, but if you are pregnant or planning to be, this is of utmost importance to you and your new baby. Research shows giving pregnant women and newborns doses of good bacteria like those found in fermented vegetables may:    Radically reduce your child's risk of developing autism or autism-like disordersProtect babies from developing eczema in childhoodHelp prevent childhood allergies  Help optimize your baby's weight later in lifeImprove the symptoms of colic, decreasing average crying times by about 75 percentReduce your risk of premature labor   For more detailed healthy pregnancy guidelines, please review my special report: ""No-Nonsense Guide to a Naturally Healthy Pregnancy and Baby,"" which covers far more than the basic nutrition tips offered here.

Over-the-Counter Drugs May Double Your Risk of Miscarriage,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2011/10/04/alert-these-overthecounter-drugs-double-the-risk-of-miscarriage.aspx,"By Dr. Mercola  It's estimated that between 10-25 percent of pregnancies result in miscarriage, and in most cases the cause is unknown, presenting a frustrating and heartbreaking scenario for many women who feel powerless to prevent a second or third miscarriage from occurring. There are, however, a growing number of factors that could play a role in your miscarriage risk, and one recently revealed is not only widespread but also very strongly correlated to miscarriage risk, so I wanted to bring it to the attention of those who may be newly pregnant or trying to conceive. Understanding this risk factor for miscarriage will give you a powerful way to take control of your pregnancy.  Avoid NSAIDS if You're Pregnant or Trying to Conceive  Many millions of Americans depend on non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) to relieve pain from arthritis, headaches, injuries and countless other conditions that cause chronic pain, but the drugs are among the most dangerous on the market. If you're pregnant, it's particularly imperative that you find another option for pain relief, as a new study found that taking non-aspirin NSAIDs in early pregnancy more than doubles your risk of miscarriage. The study involved both prescription and over-the-counter NSAIDs, all of which increased the risk of miscarriage when taken alone or in combination:  Diclofenac  Naproxen (Aleve)  Celecoxib (Celebrex)  Rofecoxib (Vioxx, now withdrawn)  Ibuprofen (Advil)   The researchers concluded:  ""Gestational exposure to any type or dosage of nonaspirin NSAIDs may increase the risk of spontaneous abortion. These drugs should be used with caution during pregnancy.""  Despite this finding, and the fact that other studies, including one published more than a decade ago, also have linked NSAIDs with an increased risk of miscarriage, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) 2011 Medication Guide for NSAIDs does not mention the potential risk. It does warn that pregnant women should not use NSAIDs late in pregnancy -- ibuprofen in the third trimester has been linked to heart problems in the baby, low amniotic fluid, and prolonged labor -- but this does nothing to warn and protect those who are newly pregnant. NSAIDs work by suppressing the production of prostaglandins (fatty acids needed for successful implantation of an embryo in the womb). Because NSAIDs and aspirin act on your whole body, they could lead to abnormal implantation that predisposes an embryo to miscarriage. The link is well established now, as still more research from 2003 found women who take NSAIDS or aspirin during pregnancy increase their risk of miscarriage by 80 percent.   Most Medications are Not Tested for Safety During Pregnancy   The truth is you need to be very careful when taking any drugs while you're pregnant. The nine months of development that take place in the womb are the most rapid and most vulnerable period of your baby's life. For this reason, it is generally best to avoid taking any medications unless absolutely necessary, including while you're trying to conceive, as you could become pregnant and not know it. Most medications have never been tested on pregnant women and their effects on a developing baby are completely unknown. Even the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) acknowledges that very little is known about the impacts of most medications on unborn babies:  ""We do not have enough information about the effects of many medications when they are taken by pregnant women  All prescription and over-the-counter medications are tested to see if they are safe and effective before they become available to the public. Pregnant women usually are not included in these tests because of the possible risks to the unborn baby.  As a result, little information is available about the safety of most medications during pregnancyincluding those available over the counterwhen they first become available.""   This is true even among drugs that are widely used by pregnant women. For instance, nearly 4 percent of pregnant women take antidepressants during their first trimester, even though a study last year -- by one of the same researchers who conducted the new NSAID study -- found they may increase your miscarriage risk by 68 percent. So it's best to use extreme caution with medications and only use those that are absolutely necessary.  More Reasons to Avoid NSAIDs (Even if You're Not Pregnant)  NSAIDs are not only dangerous to pregnant women and fetuses; they pose significant health risks to virtually everyone who takes them, and are particularly disastrous for your heart. You may be familiar with Vioxx, an NSAID pulled from the market in 2004 after 60,000 people died from its increased heart risks. Later that year, the FDA also warned that NSAIDS, such as Cox-2 inhibitors Bextra (which was pulled from the market in 2005) and Celebrex, as well as over-the-counter varieties like Aleve, Ibuprofen and aspirin, also lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular problems. A 2011 study by researchers at The University of Bern in Switzerland also revealed that NSAIDs lead to a two- to four-fold increase in your risk of heart attacks, stroke or cardiovascular death, noting that it would only take 25-50 patients being treated with NSAIDs for one year to lead to an additional heart attack or stroke. Aside from significantly increasing your heart risks, NSAIDs are linked to serious gastrointestinal risks, like bleeding of the digestive tract, increased blood pressure and kidney problems. Additionally, another class of prescription drugs, statins, which are used on tens of millions to lower cholesterol levels, should NEVER be taken in pregnancy as they are a Class X drug, which means they are virtually guaranteed to cause birth defects or miscarriage.  What are Some Non-Drug Options for Pain Relief During Pregnancy?  Medications only provide symptomatic relief and in no way, shape or form treat the underlying cause of your pain. So if you are suffering, I suggest you work with a knowledgeable health care practitioner to determine what's really triggering your pain, and then address the underlying cause. You don't need to suffer unnecessarily in the meantime, however; the following options provide excellent pain relief without any of the health hazards that medications carry:   Astaxanthin: One of the most effective oil-soluble antioxidants known. It has very potent anti-inflammatory properties and in many cases works far more effectively than many NSAIDs. Higher doses are typically required and one may need 8 mg or more per day to achieve this benefit.  Ginger: This herb is anti-inflammatory and offers pain relief and stomach-settling properties. Fresh ginger works well steeped in boiling water as a tea or grated into vegetable juice.  Curcumin: In a study of osteoarthritis patients, those who added 200 mg of curcumin a day to their treatment plan had reduced pain and increased mobility. A past study also found that a turmeric extract composed of curcuminoids (plant-based nutrients that contain powerful antioxidant properties) blocked inflammatory pathways, effectively preventing the launch of a protein that triggers swelling and pain.  Krill Oil: The omega-3 fats EPA and DHA contained in krill oil have been found by many animal and clinical studies to have anti-inflammatory properties useful for pain relief. They are also incredibly important during pregnancy.  Bromelain: This enzyme, found in pineapples, is a natural anti-inflammatory. It can be taken in supplement form but eating fresh pineapple may also be helpful.  Cetyl Myristoleate (CMO): This oil, found in fish and dairy butter, acts as a ""joint lubricant"" and an anti-inflammatory. I have used this for myself to relieve ganglion cysts and a mild annoying carpal tunnel syndrome that pops up when I type too much on non-ergonomic keyboards. I used a topical preparation for this.  Evening Primrose, Black Currant and Borage Oils: These contain the essential fatty acid gamma linolenic acid (GLA), which is useful for treating arthritic pain.  Cayenne Cream: Also called capsaicin cream, this spice comes from dried hot peppers. It alleviates pain by depleting the body's supply of substance P, a chemical component of nerve cells that transmits pain signals to your brain.  Methods such as yoga, acupuncture, meditation, hot and cold packs, and even holding hands can also result in astonishing pain relief without any drugs.    3 Tips for a Healthy Pregnancy  In addition to eating right and exercising regularly, you can give your baby the best start pre-, during and post-pregnancy by:  Making sure you keep your fructose level under 25 grams per day. There is powerful emerging evidence of the danger of excess fructose consumption. It will increase insulin and leptin resistance and also radically increase total inflammation in your body, which can cause pregnancy complications. So please be sure and count your fructose grams (it's often hidden in processed foods) and keep them below 25 grams per day.  Taking a high-quality, animal-based omega-3 fat, such as krill oil. As noted above, one of the most important dietary influences on your prenatal health is adequate omega-3 fats. Most women have major deficiencies of this fat, and given the statistics, it's very possible you do too.  Optimizing your omega-3 intake will not only virtually guarantee that your baby will be full term, but it is so essential to a child's development that if a mother and infant are deficient, the child's nervous system and immune system may never fully develop, and it can cause a lifetime of unexplained emotional, learning, and immune system disorders.  Optimizing your vitamin D levels. In the not too distant future I believe it will be mandatory for pregnant women to receive regular vitamin D blood tests. Along with reducing your risk of premature birth, studies have found that vitamin D may protect against a number of birth defects and autism.  It is absolutely imperative that pregnant women maintain a blood level of between 50 and 70 ng/ml of 25 hydroxy D. So please watch my free one-hour vitamin D lecture to find out how to get your levels optimized. Ideally you should get it by having UVB exposure on at least half of your skin. You can do this for free in the summer with sunlight but the rest of the year for many the next best option is a safe tanning bed. Your last option would be oral vitamin D, which will work but will not provide all of the benefits of the UVB skin exposure.

Vaccination During Pregnancy: Is It Really Safe?,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2013/11/10/vaccination-during-pregnancy.aspx,"By Barbara Loe Fisher  It was 1977 when I found out I was going to become a Mom. I instinctively knew I needed to be careful while I was pregnant, especially during the first two trimesters when the major organ systems of the fetus develop at a rapid rate. In the 1960s, there had been a lot of publicity about babies dying or being born without arms or legs because women had taken a drug (Thalidomide) for morning sickness in the first or second trimester of pregnancy1 and I wanted to make sure I did everything I could to protect my health and the health of my baby before and after he was born. Mothers to be in my generation were told to take extra vitamins and eat nutritious food but, most of all, to avoid anything that could harm the developing fetus like alcohol, cigarette smoke, medications, radiation, household cleaning products and other toxic exposures. Some of us were aware of the risks of heavy anesthesia during delivery and signed up for Lamaze classes to prepare for a drug-free birth, which many obstetricians discouraged, and we chose to breastfeed, even though a lot of pediatricians were pushing formula and bottles back then. Today, pregnant women face a different set of difficult questions and choices about keeping themselves and their babies healthy. Among them are whether or not to get vaccinations during pregnancy that public health officials, obstetricians and pediatricians say will protect pregnant women and their newborns from getting sick with influenza and B. pertussis whooping cough.  Toxic Exposures & Assumption of Safety  Is It A Good Idea?  Although since the 1970s, public health officials have recommended influenza vaccinations for pregnant women in the second or third trimester,2 relatively few obstetricians promoted the vaccine until the past decade when, in 2006, the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) strengthened recommendations that all pregnant women, healthy or not, should get a flu shot in any trimester.3   Then, in 2011, a pertussis containing Tdap shot was recommended for all pregnant women, preferably after 20 weeks gestation.4 Both current vaccine recommendations are5, 6, 7 endorsed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG),8, 9 the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and other medical trade associations.10, 11 With these recommendations, the time-honored rule of avoiding any potential toxic exposure that might interfere with the normal development of the fetus has been suspended and replaced with an assumption that vaccination during pregnancy is safe. But what is the scientific evidence documenting that this assumption is a well-informed one?  Glaring Lack of Safety Testing  You have to look no further than information in the vaccine manufacturer product inserts and posted online by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control (CDC) to quickly answer that question. FACT: Drug companies did not test the safety and effectiveness of giving influenza or Tdap vaccine to pregnant women before the vaccines were licensed in the U.S.12, 13 and there is almost no data on inflammatory or other biological responses to these vaccines that could affect pregnancy and birth outcomes.14 FACT: The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) lists influenza and Tdap vaccines as either Pregnancy Category B or C biologicals,15 which means that adequate testing has not been done in humans to demonstrate safety for pregnant women and it is not known whether the vaccines can cause fetal harm or affect reproduction capacity. The manufacturers of influenza and Tdap vaccines state that human toxicity and fertility studies are inadequate and warn that the influenza and Tdap vaccines should ""be given to a pregnant woman only if clearly needed.""16, 17, 18 FACT: There are ingredients in influenza and pertussis containing Tdap vaccines that have not been fully evaluated for potential genotoxic19 or other adverse effects on the human fetus developing in the womb that may negatively affect health after birth, including aluminum adjuvants, mercury containing (Thimerosal) preservatives and many more bioactive and potentially toxic ingredients.20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29 FACT: There are serious problems with outdated testing procedures for determining the potency and toxicity of pertussis vaccines and some scientists are calling for limits to be established for specific toxin content of pertussis-containing vaccines.30 FACT: There are no published biological mechanism studies that assess pre-vaccination health status and measure changes in brain and immune function and chromosomal integrity after vaccination of pregnant women or their babies developing in the womb.31 FACT: Since licensure of influenza and Tdap vaccines in the U.S., there have been no well designed prospective case controlled studies comparing the health outcomes of large groups of women who get influenza and pertussis containing Tdap vaccines during pregnancy either separately or simultaneously compared to those who do not get the vaccines, and no similar health outcome comparisons of their newborns at birth or in the first year of life have been conducted.  Safety and effectiveness evaluations that have been conducted are either small,32 retrospective,33, 34 compare vaccinated women to vaccinated women35 or have been performed by drug company or government health officials using unpublished data.36 FACT: The FDA has licensed Tdap vaccines to be given once as a single dose pertussis booster shot to individuals over 10 or 11 years old. The CDC's recommendation that doctors give every pregnant woman a Tdap vaccination during every pregnancy  regardless of whether a woman has already received one dose of Tdap  is an off-label use of the vaccine.37 FACT: Injuries and deaths from pertussis-containing vaccines are the most compensated claims in the federal Vaccine Injury Compensation Program (VICP) and influenza vaccine injuries and deaths are the second most compensated claim.38 FACT: A 2013 published study evaluating reports of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) following vaccination in the U. S. Vaccine Adverse Events Reporting System (VAERS) and in a European vaccine reaction reporting system found that seasonal influenza vaccine was the most frequently suspected cause of brain inflammation after 18 years old, representing 32 percent of the total cases reported, and pertussis containing DTaP was among the vaccines most frequently associated with brain inflammation in children between birth and age five.39 FACT: When a pregnant woman is harmed by an influenza or Tdap vaccine, drug companies selling the vaccines in the U.S., doctors and other vaccine providers are shielded from vaccine injury lawsuits40 but it is unclear whether vaccine injuries sustained by an unborn child in the womb will qualify for federal vaccine injury compensation.41  Rush to Vaccinate: Policy Preceding Science  In addition to lack of credible scientific evidence to demonstrate safety,42, 43 there is not enough credible epidemiological and biological mechanism evidence to demonstrate it is effective or necessary44, 45, 46, 47 for every pregnant woman to get an influenza and Tdap shot during every pregnancy. The rush to vaccinate pregnant women and reach into the womb to try to passively vaccinate the developing fetus48, 49 is a clear case of policy preceding science. An experimental genetically engineered nanoparticle vaccine for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and another one for Group B Streptococcus are in advanced clinical trials and reportedly likely will be exclusively recommended for pregnant women after they are licensed.50 With new vaccines on the horizon that will target pregnant women, it is critically important that more bad vaccine policy does not precede good vaccine science. Pregnant women today need to take a long, hard look at the well advertised but theoretical benefits and unknown risks of getting vaccinated during pregnancy before making a vaccine decision. It is especially important when there are so many warning signs that America's highly vaccinated child and adult population in the 21st century is not very healthy. Maternal and infant mortality statistics are a classic measure of a nation's public health status and, in this country, here are red flags that cannot be ignored any longer.  Maternal and Infant Mortality Rates High in America  How many young couples of child bearing age know that women getting pregnant and delivering babies in America today have more than twice the risk of dying during pregnancy, childbirth or after giving birth than they did three decades ago?51, 52 Women having babies are dying of heart failure, high blood pressure and stroke, infection of the blood, diabetes and blood clots in greater numbers because the maternal death rate in America has been climbing since 1987.53   We now rank a dismal number 50 in maternal mortality in the world, which is worse than that of most European countries and some countries in Asia and the Middle East.54 Equally shocking is the fact that the U.S. now has the highest first day infant death rate of all industrialized countries55 and ranks number 31 among nations in infant mortality.56 Preterm birth rates have increased 36% since the early 1980s57 and 6 out of every 1,000 babies born alive in America die before their first birthday.58 Birth defects, chromosomal damage, premature birth, low birth weight and sudden infant death syndrome are the leading causes of death for about 23,000 newborn infants every year,59 with half of those deaths occurring on the first day of life. A baby born in America is twice as likely to die within the first 24 hours as babies born in the European Union.60  Why Is Health in the U.S. on Such A Steep Decline?  U.S. public health officials say there are ""no clear"" answers for why our maternal mortality rate is skyrocketing.61 They don't know why so many of our babies are dying on the first day and within the first year of life, in stark contrast to many other nations where maternal and infant mortality rates are declining. Public health officials also can't figure out why so many infants and children in America are plagued with brain and immune system problems. The unprecedented, unexplained chronic disease and disability epidemic62 has gotten worse in the past three decades  with 1 child in 6 now learning disabled;63 1 in 9 suffering with asthma;64 1 in 50 developing autism;65 1 in 400 becoming diabetic66 and millions more suffering with severe food allergies,67 inflammatory bowel disease68 and other chronic illness.69,70 The health of American adults has also deteriorated during the past three decades compared to other wealthy nations where health is improving71 and our life expectancy is worse than many other countries as well.72 The CDC says that today chronic diseases are the most common and costly causes of death and disability with about half of all adults living with at least one chronic illness.73  U.S. Number One Market for Drugs & Vaccines  What is not on the list of potential causes for this failing public health report card is lack of access to drugs and vaccines. With a population of 316 million people out of 7 billion people on the Earth, the U.S. spends nearly $3 trillion per year on health care74  more than any other nation in the world75, 76  and we consume 40 percent of all drugs sold globally.77, 78, 79 In addition, America is the leading purchaser of vaccines in the world's $32 billion vaccine market.80, 81, 82 Since 1981, 95 percent of all children entering kindergarten have received multiple doses of seven vaccines including pertussis and measles vaccines.83 In 1991, the CDC recommended all infants get a hepatitis B shot at 12 hours old84 and, by 2012, more than 70 percent of all newborns had received a hepatitis B shot at birth while between 80 and 90 percent of three year olds had gotten multiple doses of eleven vaccines.85 In a crusade to eliminate an expanding list of microbes, U.S. health officials currently direct pediatricians to give children 49 doses of 14 vaccines by age six starting on the day of birth with more than two dozen doses administered by an infant's first birthday.86 More than two dozen additional vaccinations are recommended or mandated for teenagers and adults, including annual flu shots throughout life.87  Has Mandated Use of More Vaccines Compromised America's Health?  Every state in the U.S. has laws requiring dozens of vaccinations for daycare and school attendance88 in contrast to neighboring Mexico and Canada, which recommend but do not mandate vaccines (a provision in Canada's Constitution prohibits compulsory vaccination).89 Japan, New Zealand, Australia, Iceland and Norway recommend but do not legally require vaccines and 15 countries in the European Union, including United Kingdom, Germany, Spain, Greece, Denmark, Netherlands, Finland and Austria similarly recommend but do not mandate vaccines.90 All of these countries have lower infant mortality rates than the U.S. and do not recommend that infants under one year old get as many vaccines as American infants do.91   In fact, no other country legally requires92 the numbers of vaccinations that the U.S. does for children to attend daycare and school or for adults to keep their jobs.93 It is no wonder that more Americans are asking questions about why our children need so many vaccines and why adults need to get a flu shot every year  even during pregnancy  when our population is already the most vaccinated in the world but far less healthy than other countries that do not mandate or recommend so many vaccines.  Ask for the Science  If you are pregnant and have other children, be aware that the American Academy of Pediatrics is urging pediatricians to vaccinate parents bringing their children in for sick or well baby visits, especially pregnant women.94 If an obstetrician or pediatrician pressures you to get vaccinated while you are pregnant, ask the doctor to show you the science.95 If you conclude the vaccine's benefits do not outweigh the risks for you and your baby but are threatened or sanctioned in any way for making an informed choice, you should find another doctor who will treat you with respect and honor your health care choices.

It's your health, your family, your choice. [+] Sources and References      1See All References"
Omega 3 Benefits Your Baby's Brain and Eyes,http://articles.mercola.com/sites/articles/archive/2009/11/17/Omega3-Benefits-Baby-Brains-and-Eyes.aspx,"The European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) has confirmed that the omega-3 fats, DHA and ALA, can benefit eye and cognitive development in babies. EFSA supported the role of these fats in fetal and newborn eye and brain development but said there was an adequate supply in breast milk. Their rejection of the need for supplementation did not please those that back omega-3 supplementation in infants and other population sub-groups. These groups say that EFSA ignored intervention studies, and did not take into account the totality of evidence before it. [+] Sources and References     NutraIngredients October 28, 2009"
