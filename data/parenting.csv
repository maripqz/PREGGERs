 Rethinking Toddler Nutrition,http://www.parenting.com/toddler/feeding-nutrition/rethink-toddler-nutrition,"Fruits and veggies are a good start, but most toddler diets are missing a key nutritional element.<a href=""http://www.shutterstock.com/pic.mhtml?id=171827480&amp;src=id"" target=""_blank"">Shutterstock</a>Family meals should feel more like bonding opportunities than chores or ordeals. But to make mealtime more positive, you have to serve foods that both meet your kids' nutritional needs and are tasty enough for children to actually eat and enjoy.Proper nutrition involves more than fruits and vegetables, says Dr. Scott Cohen, a pediatrician, father and author of ""<a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Eat-Sleep-Poop-Common-Sense/dp/1439117063/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1413827216&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=eat+sleep+poop"" target=""_blank"">Eat, Sleep, Poop: A Common Sense Guide to Your Baby's First Year</a><em>.</em>"" He says DHA is another critical component. DHA is an omega-3 fatty acid beneficial to brain development and cognition.""Eighty-five percent of brain growth happens in the first three years of life,"" Cohen says. Infants receive vital nutrients through breastfeeding and fortified formula, but their supply dwindles when children begin eating solid food.In fact, toddlers only average 25 percent of the recommended daily DHA intake, which is 70 to 100 milligrams. It can be easy to reach the allowance, but DHA-rich foods aren't popular items on toddler's plates. Major sources include fish, such as tuna, salmon and trout.To <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/toddler/feeding-nutrition/get-your-toddler-kitchen-and-eating-healthier"">improve your child's nutrition</a>, Cohen recommends a five-item nutrition checklist:Increasing DHA in your child's diet doesn't have to be difficult. Cohen recommends trying DHA-friendly options, such as <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/toddler/feeding-nutrition/fish-back-menu-pregnant-women-and-tots"">fish</a>, or DHA-fortified foods such as pasta and milk. ""One size doesn't fit all,"" Cohen says. ""Any way toddlers can get it is good.""Cohen says toddlers should consume two to three dairy sources each day for strong bones, muscles and teeth. Common child favorites include milk, yogurt and cheese, but fortified orange juice can also do the trick.""A lot of kids don't like typical protein sources,"" Cohen says. Look at protein alternatives instead of battling over eggs, fish or meat your picky eater won't try. Soy products and beans are subtle substitutes.While each meal can be a step in the right nutritional direction, Cohen recommends looking at the big picture. ""It's more important to teach healthy eating habits than to concentrate on volume,"" he says. Proper routines set children up for a lifetime of nutrition success.Introduce a variety of food to children beyond standard favorites. ""Offer three or four different options in the hope that they will eat one of them,"" Cohen says. Don't give up if children resist at first. It can take 10 to 12 tries before they develop preferences. ""They might like it next week,"" he says. ""The bottom line is not to stress too much. Every healthy child grows, no matter what."""

They then pull a “smash lever” that comes down and (you guessed it) smashes the food into a flat, gooey mess. The food drips into three jars that illustrate its actual sugar, salt, and oil content. From there, your kids can see how accurate their guess was. After the results are shown, a chart pops up that illustrates how the nutrient levels in the food compare to the nutritional needs of a child their age, activity level, and gender.

Focusing on good nutrition, diverse food options and healthy snacks, rather than calories and weight, can help teach kids how to eat healthy and make smart decisions for themselves.""Instilling good eating habits early can help put a child on the path to a healthy future,"" says Dr. Kathleen Reidy, a registered dietitian and head of Nutrition Science for Meals and Drinks in Nestlé's Infant Nutrition department.Reidy is the lead author of <a href=""http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?mID=3445&amp;sKey=4a0019aa-3f7b-42f2-99c4-f152a77fdde4&amp;cKey=7fd8db4d-f161-47bc-b4e7-f55ccdf2f8fe&amp;mKey=5b9d1ebb-5eef-4e8e-9ffa-641686838541"" target=""_blank"">Nestlé's Feeding Infants and Toddlers Study</a> (FITS), which is the largest dietary-intake survey of young children from birth to 4 years old in the United States.""Nestlé realized a huge gap in nutrition information available for this age group, and this study help fills that gap,"" Reidy says. ""It is a valuable resource in the pediatric and health community and referenced by organizations, such as the <a href=""http://www.fda.gov"" target=""_blank"">FDA</a> and <a href=""http://www.aap.org/en-us/Pages/Default.aspx"" target=""_blank"">AAP</a>.""The initial study was completed in 2002, and Nestlé has continued to collect and analyze data and learn from it. The findings that were published in 2008 have been updated and were presented at the 2014 <a href=""http://experimentalbiology.org/2014/Home.aspx"" target=""_blank"">Experimental Biology</a> conference on April 28 in San Diego, Calif.<strong>The</strong> <strong>power</strong> <strong>of snacks</strong><br>At a time when <a href=""http://www.fns.usda.gov/school-meals/smart-snacks-school"" target=""_blank"">Smart Snacks in Schools</a> nutrition standards and guidelines are being implemented across the United States, these insights may have implications for helping address childhood obesity even before kids go to school.</br>""Our findings indicate snacks provide a significant portion—25 percent—of calories in children 1 to 4 years old,"" Reidy says.The study also found that young children who consume snacks away from home—at daycare, friends' houses or while running errands with Mom or Dad—eat an additional 50 calories per day.<a href=""http://www.abstractsonline.com/Plan/ViewAbstract.aspx?mID=3445&amp;sKey=4a0019aa-3f7b-42f2-99c4-f152a77fdde4&amp;cKey=9e7cedfc-bda9-4c5d-b082-4ea24a3d93c6&amp;mKey=5b9d1ebb-5eef-4e8e-9ffa-641686838541"" target=""_blank"">According to the study</a>, children who eat one or more snacks away from home are more likely to consume sweets, such as cookies, candy and sweetened beverages, and less likely to consume milk.<strong>Dairy intake</strong><br>Milk is key in children's diets and a top contributor of many important nutrients, including protein; calcium; vitamins A, D and B12; thiamin; and riboflavin. However, it was found to be one of the top sources of saturated fat in children's diets because they were generally consuming whole or two percent milk. Therefore, the recommendation is not for parents to limit milk, but instead to offer lower-fat options, such as one percent and skim.</br>The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends breast milk from 0 to 12 months old, whole milk from 1 to 2 years old and low-fat milk after age 2. If heart disease runs in a child's family, the AAP advises switching to low-fat milk at 1 year old.""Nestlé supports the <a href=""http://www.who.int/en/"" target=""_blank"">World Health Organization</a>'s recommendation of <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/tips-for-breastfeeding-success"">breastfeeding</a> children for the first six months their lives, then introducing safe and appropriate complementary foods, preferably while continuing to breastfeed, until children turn 2,"" Reidy says. ""Whenever you make the switch to low-fat milk, make sure you add healthy fat. Avocado, fish and products made with olive, canola and safflower oils are all good sources of it. Children do need fat but tend to not get enough healthy fat.""<strong>Nutrients</strong> <strong>on</strong> <strong>the go</strong><br>Kids also have trouble getting enough of the daily recommended amount of nutrients, such as calcium to build strong bones; iron to make hemoglobin, the oxygen-carrying component of red blood cells; potassium to aid in nerve and muscle function and water balance; and fiber to help with digestion and food intake.</br>""Nutrition issues during this period can have lifelong effects,"" Reidy says. ""The period of 0 to 4 years old is such a critical time in child development because every organ system in kids' bodies is developing and being shaped and formed rapidly.""Reidy says families can play an important role in this development by <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/gallery/healthy-kids-snacks"">providing nutritious snacks</a>, especially when on the go, by cutting up fresh fruits or precooked veggies to pack in to-go containers.Many food distributors, such as <a href=""https://www.gerber.com/Home"" target=""_blank"">Gerber</a>, which is part of Nestlé, package healthy snacks in convenient pouches or single-serving containers.""Snacks provide nutrition throughout the day for energy, so think of them as mini-meals rather than treats,"" Reidy says. ""Plan ahead, and talk to your child's other caretakers, such as family members and daycare providers, to make sure you're on the same page.""<strong>Fruits and veggies</strong><br>During the second year, it is especially important for parents to provide healthy options when transitioning their kids to table food. According to Reidy, between 9 and 11 months old, kids consume more veggies than at any other time between birth and 4 years old. When baby food drops out of the diet, kids consume much fewer veggies and the quality of the veggies changes. For example, starchy potatoes replace vitamin-rich yellow and green veggies.</br>To help kids get the nutrients they need, Reidy recommends <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/food-recipes/snacks/10-creative-healthy-snacks-kids"">snacks that contain a variety of colorful fruits and vegetables</a>, low-fat dairy and whole grains and ones that limit saturated fat, sugar and sodium.""Expose kids to different tastes and textures, and pay attention to the developmental appropriateness of foods. Kids don't always have the motor skills to eat a wide variety of food,"" Reidy says.

 Nursing Nutrition,http://www.parenting.com/article/nursing-nutrition,"Sure, your milk is affected by what you eat, but you can still breastfeed and chow down on chili, says Stacey Rubin, author of <em>The ABCs of Breastfeeding</em>. Here's what you need to know:<strong>Whole Grains, Protein, Fresh Fruits and Vegetables</strong> You know the bulk of your nutrition should come from whole grains, protein, veggies, and fruits, but even if you have an odd day when your diet consists mostly of M&amp;M's, you'll still produce healthy milk to satisfy your baby.<strong>Water</strong> You only need to quench your thirst -- there's no reason to guzzle more than that. Just keep a glass of water handy when you sit down to nurse (breastfeeding will naturally make you thirsty).<strong>Fish</strong> The same rules as pregnancy apply: Eat no more than a total of 12 ounces a week of low-mercury cooked fish such as wild salmon, shrimp, pollock, and up to 6 ounces a week of canned chunk-light tuna.<strong>Dairy</strong> Most babies are fine with cow's-milk proteins in their breast milk. Cut out dairy -- milk, cheese, yogurt -- only if your baby has signs of an allergic reaction: diarrhea, irritability, a rash, hives (call his doctor if these signs appear).<strong>Caffeine and Alcohol</strong> One or two cups of coffee, tea, or soda is not the reason your baby is up all night -- if only it were that easy! Enjoy a glass of wine with a meal after your baby's last feeding and you won't need to pump and dump.To learn more about your nursing nutritional needs, visit mypyramid.gov."
 The Growing Baby's Guide to Nutrition,http://www.parenting.com/article/growing-babys-guide-to-nutrition,"One of the thrills of being a parent is watching your child take that first spoonful of mushy baby food. It's a milestone you'll never forget, and as she advances to chunkier solids and eventually real family meals, both baby's and mom's pleasure increase. But how do you know when your little one is ready for a new food experience? And what should you be feeding her in the meantime to optimize her health? To aid in your food shopping and preparation, here's a guide organized by age group, along with suggested items for nutritious -- and delicious -- daily dining.<b>6 Months: The Experimental Stage</b><b>WHAT TO FEED:</b> Breast milk or formula should make up the bulk of baby's diet for the first six months, meeting most of his nutritional needs. Between 4 and 6 months, you should gradually ease solids into your child's meals. Start with a good source of iron, especially if your infant has been breastfed. (Infant formula has iron added.) Iron-deficiency anemia is a health concern, so it's a must-have mineral for your baby. The best source of iron is red meat or poultry. The next best source is fortified cereals, with whole-grain cereals being better than rice cereal. Mix cereal with enough breast milk or formula to create a liquid consistency, and feed with a spoon. Once he's accepted this, you can offer strained fruits and vegetables. Start with single-ingredient foods; this way, if there are any allergic reactions (rash, vomiting or extremely loose stools), identifying the source won't be an issue. Offer baby about a half-teaspoonful of food at a time. At 7 to 9 months, you should add strained meats and poultry (another great source of iron and protein), and by 10 months, you can begin the transition to table food by offering teething biscuits for baby to gum and mashed foods to introduce a little texture.Making your own baby food is an option, but commercial baby food is safe and nutritious too. Frank Greer, M.D., professor of pediatrics at the University of Wisconsin and former chairman of the American Academy of Pediatrics National Committee on Nutrition, points out one advantage to jarred baby food is that it's preserved. ""Home preparations are not sterilized, so moms have to be careful to wash everything very well,"" he says. ""Also, homemade baby food can't be kept around very long. If it hasn't been eaten after two days, throw it out."" Moms who are concerned about preservatives but don't have the time to make baby food at home can try one of the organic baby food lines such as Earth's Best and Gerber Organic.<b>WHAT'S GOING ON AT THIS STAGE:</b> The introduction of solids is a social learning exercise for baby. ""Children want to be part of the family unit, and eating together is important,"" says nutritionist Althea Zanecosky, R.D., former spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association and mother of two. ""Sit baby in a high chair and pull it up to the table. Even if he rejects the food you're trying that day, you're teaching him that food is a social activity. He'll learn that this is the time we put away the toys and we're all together.""<b>WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR:</b> When introducing new foods, it's important to watch for signs of food intolerance. Offer baby a small amount of one new food for several days before moving onto the next. Avoid feeding your baby honey, which can cause infant botulism, a form of food poisoning, and citrus fruits, which are too acidic for young stomachs. Zanecosky notes that while eggs and nuts have a reputation as infant allergens, they are actually fine. In fact, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) changed its stance on delaying the introduction of common allergens in 2008. ""Many pediatricians recommend against giving eggs and fish in the first year of life because of allergic reactions, but there is no evidence that introducing these nutrient-dense foods after 4 to 6 months of age determines whether your baby will be allergic to them,"" she explains.Experts also advise that you pay attention to baby's signals of hunger and fullness. By 6 months, an infant will show his desire to eat by opening his mouth and leaning forward. When baby turns his face or mouth away, he's telling you he's finished eating for now.<b>12 Months: Expanding Culinary Horizons</b><b>WHAT TO FEED:</b> By 1 year, baby should be comfortably eating table food. A variety of healthful choices should meet her protein, energy and vitamin needs. Keep in mind that despite having a mouthful of teeth, babies process food by mashing it with their gums, so the table foods shouldn't be too tough. Here's a good test: Try to mash and dissolve the food in your mouth without chewing or biting down. If you're successful, baby should be as well.Breastfeeding may continue at this age, but whole milk is a very important part of a 1-year-old diet as well. ""Children under 2 need whole milk for brain, bone and nervous system development,"" explains Greer. However, Zanecosky notes the AAP's new 2008 milk guidelines, which advise parents to switch to reduced-fat milk for toddlers between 1 and 2 years old if a toddler is overweight or obese, or if there is a family history of obesity, high cholesterol or cardiovascular disease.Focus on good eating habits overall. Don't offer too many fried foods or sweets that are high in fat, and give your tot nutritious snacks like fresh fruit or graham crackers. Offer 100 percent whole-wheat bread or whole grains instead of white bread.<b>WHAT'S GOING ON AT THIS STAGE:</b> ""Babies are learning about taste and texture, as taste buds and swallowing skills come together between 12 and 18 months,"" says Janice E. Stuff, Ph.D., R.D., assistant professor at the USDA/ARS Children's Nutrition Research Center at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston. ""So if your child rejects a certain food, try again later. Or, if she's pushing food around, it means she's had enough. Put her plate aside -- in an hour she may want it again.""Studies show that babies eat when they're hungry and don't eat when they're not. ""Children have a wonderful ability to self-regulate,"" Zanecosky says. ""You really have to listen to their cues. If they're not hungry, don't force them to eat, even if it's inconvenient for you. Bring portable food with you for them to eat later.""<b>WHAT TO WATCH OUT FOR:</b> If, like many kids, baby rejects vegetables, you can substitute fruits, which have many of the same nutrients. For example, both zucchini and cantaloupe are good sources of vitamin A. Start with the zucchini on the plate, but keep cantaloupe available as a backup.<b></b>18 Months: Try Everything<b>WHAT TO FEED:</b> By 1 1/2, toddlers are more adept at eating finger foods or using a spoon, but they still require supervision at mealtime. Serve table food cut in very small pieces, and avoid choking hazards like popcorn, hard candy, hot dogs, jellybeans, chunks of carrots, grapes and raisins.It's important not to rely on milk -- breast or otherwise -- as the sole source of key nutrients at this point. ""Keep trying a variety of foods, using the major food groups as a guide,"" says Greer.<b>WHAT'S GOING ON AT THIS STAGE:</b> At this age, baby will point, try to articulate a word for food, or bang his fists or a utensil on the high chair tray if he's still interested in eating. It's perfectly fine to offer more until your little one indicates he's had enough. A food baby rejected at 12 months might be acceptable to him at 18 months, and having family members as role models will encourage him to try new foods. If baby sees his sister eating her vegetables, he'll try his too."

But many healthy foods can fulfill those pesky cravings and help you control weight gain during pregnancy. Maintaining a healthy diet and knowing what to eat and what not to eat during pregnancy are important not only to avoid excessive weight gain but also because what you eat affects the overall health of you and your baby.<p dir=""ltr"">""As moms-to-be embark on this exciting phase of their lives and bring a new life into the world, your health and managing a healthy weight gain during pregnancy is of the utmost importance,"" says Dr. Liz Applegate, nationally renowned nutrition and fitness expert. ""Research reveals that excessive weight gain can set the stage for weight struggles for mom persisting well beyond 'baby years.'""<p dir=""ltr"">Weight gain during pregnancy is different for every mom, but the optimal amount of weight gain for women who have a healthy body mass index — defined as between 18.5 and 24.9 — is 25 to 35 pounds. If a woman starts out underweight, the amount of gain should be more; if she is overweight, the amount should be less.<p dir=""ltr"">A common misconception about eating while pregnant stems from the idea that a woman is ""eating for two."" A pregnant woman does not have to double her caloric intake and portions. Women should only consume an extra 200 to 300 calories per day — and that's only during the second and third trimesters.<p dir=""ltr"">""Proper weight gain promotes normal development of the developing baby,"" Applegate says. ""Being overweight or obese during pregnancy can increase the risk of developing gestational diabetes, problems with blood pressure and complications with delivery, such as preterm birth.""<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Sweet </span><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/gallery/weird-pregnancy-cravings"" style=""line-height: 1.6;"">cravings</a><span style=""line-height: 1.6;""> are common during pregnancy because of changes in hormonal levels, and research shows that women with gestational diabetes experience more intense cravings.</span><p dir=""ltr"">""Incorporating low- and no-calorie sweeteners is a safe and helpful way to satisfy sweet desires without unwanted calories,"" Applegate says.<p dir=""ltr"">The FDA has deemed some low- or zero-calorie sweeteners, including sucralose (Splenda), aspartame (Equal), saccharin (Sweet'N Low), and stevia (Truvia), safe for pregnant and breastfeeding women. Applegate recommends using one of these sweeteners in iced tea or a sugar-free yogurt topped with berries, which includes calcium, vitamin C and other nutrients.<p dir=""ltr""><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Approximately 200 milligrams or less of caffiene is safe to consume daily, according to the </span><a href=""http://www.acog.org/Resources_And_Publications/Committee_Opinions/Committee_on_Obstetric_Practice/Moderate_Caffeine_Consumption_During_Pregnancy"" style=""line-height: 1.6;"" target=""_blank"">American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists</a><span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">. This is equivalent to a 12-ounce brewed coffee or four cans of Diet Coke.</span>""A mom-to-be can feel comfortable about enjoying this moderate amount of caffeine during the day but should avoid caffeine intake later in the day so as not to disrupt sleeping,"" Applegate says.<span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Another key aspect of staying healthy during pregnancy is exercise. The goal for all adults, whether they are pregnant or not, is 150 minutes per week of moderate exercise. The most important thing to remember is that you can continue with the same level of activity you performed before becoming pregnant, but pay attention to what your body is telling you.</span>""Women who are very athletic, such as serious runners and dancers, can continue with their activities, but should modify according to how they feel,"" Applegate says. ""Any cramping, dizziness or nausea should signal a woman to slow down or stop the activity."" Contact sports, though, should be avoided.<span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Another misconception is that </span><a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/help-what-can-i-eat"" style=""line-height: 1.6;"">pregnant women should steer clear from fish and seafood</a><span style=""line-height: 1.6;""> because of mercury, a metal contaminant found in fish. However, Applegate believes you should view fish as a ""critical part"" of your pregnancy diet.</span>Fish supplies omega-3 fats, which are essential for brain and eye development in babies, improve heart health, and possibly reduce anxiety and depression for moms.The <a href=""http://www.cnpp.usda.gov/Publications/NutritionInsights/Insight46.pdf"" target=""_blank"">USDA Diet Guidelines</a> and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that pregnant and breastfeeding women consume at least 8 to 12 ounces of fish per week.""The best fish and seafood to consume are salmon, shrimp, catfish, pollock and canned fish, such as light tuna and wild-caught salmon. [They] can provide a convenient option,"" Applegate says. ""Pregnant and breastfeeding women should avoid four exotic fish: shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish, which are not commonly eaten or available in the U.S., as these fish tend to contain higher amounts of mercury.""<span style=""line-height: 1.6;"">Foods that present risk for food-borne illness, such as raw seafood, sprouts and certain dairy and meats, should not be consumed. When consuming dairy, Applegate advises to check the label to make sure the items are made with pasteurized milk and milk products.</span>""Soft cheeses, such as Brie, Camembert and Mexican-style cheeses, are typically unpasteurized and may pose a risk for food-borne illness called listeriosis,"" Applegate says. ""Pregnant women are more susceptible to this form of food-borne illness than the general population. This illness may result in miscarriage and premature delivery.""Some everyday foods with a risk for bacterial contamination and listeriosis include meats such as hot dogs and cold cuts; eggs; raw seafood; and sprouts.<p dir=""ltr"">Eating healthy during pregnancy also makes for an easier weight-loss journey after delivery. Maintaining a proper diet doesn't have to stop after your baby is born.<p dir=""ltr"">""Your eating habits during pregnancy and after childbirth set the stage for your new baby and family,"" Applegate says. ""Establishing healthy eating patterns now will benefit all your loved ones."""

In other words, the child adapts to its environment before it's even born.""The nine months of pregnancy are not just important for the health of the mom and fetus but also the adult life of the unborn baby,"" Daneshmand says. ""Many health care providers don't take time to really talk with pregnant women about their health. Instead of prescribing pills and medications, we should be educating women about healthy food and exercise and giving them access to these things before disease occurs.""That's why Daneshmand founded <a href=""http://www.miraclebabies.org"" target=""_blank"">Miracle Babies</a> and its preventive arm, <a href=""http://www.miraclebabies.org/programs/healthy-women-healthy-children/"" target=""_blank"">Healthy Women, Healthy Children</a> (HWHC).""It's simple,"" Daneshmand says. ""If women are healthier, then children, and eventually adults, will be healthier. It's the circle of life, and it starts with women.""HWHC enhances the well-being of women, children, and families through education, prevention, and medical care. The nonprofit organization is currently working with three YMCAs in California area to provide prescription passes, free child care, and nutritional classes to low-income women.HWHC has also teamed up with researchers to conduct additional study of fetal programming. They include Sean Newcomer, assistant professor and exercise physiologist at California State University, San Marcos; Kristin Spivey, a cell biologist and scientific consultant at Annuary Healthcare; and Lynn Fieser, HWHC's program director.""We are in the early stages of a pilot research study that will examine the umbilical cord blood vessel of 10 pregnant women: five who are exercising during their pregnancy and five who aren't,"" Daneshmand says. ""We will look for DNA sequencing and methylation status, which play an important role in development and disease.""Their theory: If a pregnant woman is eating healthy foods and exercising, certain genes in the fetus ""turn on"" and or ""turn off."" This way, she reduces the risk of her child growing up to develop long-term diseases, such as diabetes and hypertension.""By eliminating long-term diseases, we can reduce health care costs,"" Daneshmand says. ""If we focus on the causes of poor nutrition—genetics and a lack of education and resources, especially in low-income areas—we can solve this issue systemically.""According to the <a href=""http://www.cdc.gov"" target=""_blank"">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a>, 75 percent of health care spending goes toward treating chronic diseases.""For less than $800 in 6 months,"" Daneshmand says, ""HWHC can get a woman healthier through its collaboration with local OB/GYNs, federally funded community clinics, and gyms, such as the YMCA.""On May 4, Miracle Babies will host its annual fundraiser, a <a href=""http://www.miraclebabies.org/2013/upcoming-events/miracle-babies-5k/"" target=""_blank"">5K run/walk</a>.

It means what you eat affects the health of both you and baby. Maintaining proper nutrition during pregnancy can help keep you energized through all three trimesters, and it can give your growing baby the right combination of vitamins, minerals, and proteins to develop correctly. Eating a little junk food now and then will not harm you and your baby, but you don't want to get all of your daily calories from foods high in fat and low in nutrients.According to the <a href=""http://food.unl.edu/fnh"" target=""_blank"">University of Nebraska</a>, avoiding the wrong foods can help you as much as eating the right foods.Throughout your pregnancy, morning sickness and heartburn can make you feel miserable and affect your eating habits. Luckily, eating meals and snacks more frequently can help keep tummy woes at bay. Instead of eating three large meals per day, try eating six to eight small meals per day. Aim to eat something about every four hours throughout the day."
 Drive-Thru Nutrition,http://www.parenting.com/article/drive-thru-nutrition,"It's okay to succumb to temptation every once in a while. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that you eat about 300 extra calories daily during pregnancy and 500 extra if you're breastfeeding. So while you'll probably want to avoid the Big Mac (which has an incredible 32 grams of fat!), here are some mom-friendly fast-food dishes.<i>Tracey Zemitis is a freelance writer based in Santa Monica, CA.</i>Quick tip: A healthy side salad or other tasty side dish can often be substituted at no extra charge for the greasy french fries in a value meal. You should also ask to switch the caffeine-laden soda with low-fat milk or orange juice (or just go with water) so you'll limit your intake of this sometimes nerve-jangling substance.Don't be fooled: The breaded or fried chicken and fish items at your favorite burger spot, which would be good for you if they were grilled or broiled, are loaded with fat and calories  -- usually outweighing the burgers on both counts.Subway sandwich shops actively promote the health benefits of their menu, which offers ""seven for six"": seven different sandwiches, with less than 6 grams of fat apiece. Subway is a great choice for moms, because it also offers healthy salads, veggie burgers, veggie sandwiches, light salad dressings, baked potato chips, and fat-free pretzels. It also uses only low-fat, low-calorie mayonnaise in its tuna, chicken, and seafood salads.Another safe choice is Arby's  -- if you stick to the ""Light"" menu. The Light Roast Chicken Deluxe, Light Roast Beef Deluxe, and Light Roast Turkey Deluxe each have less than 300 calories and 5 grams of fat or less. Or try Taco Bell to curb your craving for Mexican food: A Taco Bell Taco (170 cal, 10g fat) or Soft Taco (210 cal, 10g fat) with a side of fiber-rich Pintos n' Cheese or Mexican Rice (each 190 cal, 9g fat) provide tasty and healthy options. Other great selections: a Grilled Steak Soft Taco or a Grilled Chicken Soft Taco (each 200 cal, 7g fat).Don't be fooled: Many items sound like they're good for you, but the numbers tell a different story. For example, an Arby's Turkey Sub Sandwich has a whopping 670 calories and 39 grams of fat, and an Arby's Chicken Broccoli Baked Potato weighs in at 830 calories and 47 grams of fat. Advertisements can also lead you astray  -- heavily promoted wrap and pita-bread sandwiches often contain high-fat cheese and dressing in addition to the more promotable lean meat and lettuce. When researchers at Tufts University recently tested several wraps from different fast-food chains, they topped out at 64 grams of fat and 790 calories.KFC's Tender Roast Sandwich, without the sauce (270 cal, 5g fat), makes a healthy and tasty selection. Pair with a side such as mashed potatoes (even with gravy, it's a healthier choice than potato wedges, which at KFC weigh in at 280 cal, 13g fat), corn on the cob, or BBQ baked beans, all of which contain less than 200 calories and 6 grams of fat. Even KFC's Macaroni and Cheese (180 cal, 8g fat) is a fairly safe indulgence.At Boston Market, a good bet is white-meat chicken without skin, which has a mere 170 calories and 4 grams of fat (as a general rule, chicken with dark meat and skin is higher in calories and fat). For variety, try the lean Skinless Rotisserie Turkey (170 cal, 1g fat).Don't be fooled: Beware of items Boston Market labels ""low-fat""; their calorie count is often sky-high. For example, the Chunky Cinnamon Apple Sauce may be fat-free, but it's loaded with sugar at 250 calories, and a low-fat Baked Sweet Potato has a heart-stopping 460 calories. For side dishes at Boston Market, stick with steamed vegetables, rice pilaf, black beans, mashed potatoes, and fresh fruit.Don't be fooled: Think a Pizza Hut Personal Pan Pizza sounds like a way to trim portion size and, therefore, calories? Think again: One of these offerings has more than 800 calories and nearly 30 grams of fat.Practice Safe SaladEach of McDonalds' new ""McSalad Shakers""  -- Chef, Garden, and Grilled Chicken Caesar  -- has less than 150 calories and 8 grams of fat (stick to the fat-free vinaigrette dressing, which has only 30 calories per packet). Wendy's salad menu also features a variety of healthy alternatives  -- Caesar Side, Deluxe Garden, Grilled Chicken, and Grilled Chicken Caesar  -- for less than 300 calories and 10 grams of fat apiece. Avoid the Taco Salad, though: It's got 19 grams of fat.Salad bars (such as the one at Pizza Hut or Wendy's Garden Spot) become a nutritious option only when you load up on the veggies and go easy on cheeses, meats, prepared salads, and desserts. The way you top your greens can make all the difference: Picking light over regular dressing can save you up to 300 calories and 30 grams of fat.Don't be fooled: Not all salads are the lowest calorie and fat choices at a fast-food restaurant: A Boston Market Chicken Caesar Salad has about the same amount of calories and fat as a Burger King Whopper without the mayo, and a Taco Bell Taco Salad with Salsa has a ridiculous 52 grams of fat!Quick tip: McDonalds' new Fruit n' Yogurt Parfait (fruit layered with lowfat yogurt, only available in some cities) is not only a low-fat, low-calorie calcium boost, but can work for breakfast or dessert.Though fast food should never be a staple of any diet, it's often a must for moms on the go. Armed with the right information, you can find tasty, healthy choices that will give you the energy you need without super-sizing your body.Don't answer until you've read these tips:<b>Look for variety. </b>Select a chain that offers as much variety as possible in food choices (are grains, fruits, vegetables, and low-fat dairy products available?) and cooking methods (are some items grilled or broiled instead of fried?).<b>Ask for it. </b>Just because it's a fast-food restaurant doesn't mean you must sacrifice your consumer rights. Ask how an item is prepared, and ask for dressing or cheese on the side, or replace it with lettuce and tomato. Don't assume a restaurant won't oblige: Many chains, such as Burger King, pride themselves on their ability to customize their menu.<b>Keep it simple.</b> The fewer toppings (bacon, cheese, croutons), breading, dressing, and other add-ons, the better. Plain items are generally lower in fat and in calories.<b>Control portion size.</b> Cut a burger in half, or share it with a friend to cut back on the calories. Smaller sandwiches and side dishes are usually healthier, even if you must fork over a little more cash for an extra item or two.<b>Soothe morning sickness.</b> Select items that are light on grease and spice, and drink plenty of water with your meal. Ask for ""simplified"" items (a plain English muffin or a grilled chicken filet without the sauce or bun, for example).<b>Educate yourself.</b> Detailed nutrition information on many fast-food items is available on the Internet (check out <a class=""vglnk"" href=""http://www.mcdonalds.com"" rel=""nofollow""><span>www</span><span>.</span><span>mcdonalds</span><span>.</span><span>com</span></a> or <a class=""vglnk"" href=""http://www.tacobell.com"" rel=""nofollow""><span>www</span><span>.</span><span>tacobell</span><span>.</span><span>com</span></a>, for example).

 3 Biggest Kid Nutrition Myths,http://www.parenting.com/article/3-biggest-kid-nutrition-myths,"With so much conflicting information out there, figuring out what and how to feed your kids these days is confusing. Below, William Sears, M.D., tackles the most confounding kid-food conundrums.<b>Kids need to eat three square meals a day.</b> Nope. In fact, grazing, or eating a few small meals throughout the day, is a very healthy way to eat (and that goes for parents, too). Plus, it comes naturally to kids, who can't hold as much food in their stomachs at one time as adults. A slow-and-steady schedule of meals and snacks keeps their blood-sugar levels, energy, and moods on a more even keel. So if they don't clean their plates at lunch, don't stress; they'll want the leftovers in a couple of hours.<b>Sugar is bad.</b> Actually, it really depends on the type. There's a wide spectrum of carbohydrates (the other name for sugar), and those that are complex (veggies, whole grains, legumes) are always recommended. Complex carbs are digested slowly and act like a time-released capsule of energy. Fruits and dairy products (which contain lactose, another form of sugar) are also good choices. It's the simple sugars -- table sugar and high-fructose corn syrup in candy, cookies, soft drinks, and packaged treats -- that are responsible for that dreaded crash and burn. These are the ones worth limiting.<b>Children should eat from each food group every day. </b>The fact is, kids have ever-changing taste preferences. One week they may eat pasta and tomato sauce, while the next they shun it for peanut-butter crackers. Doesn't matter. As long as their diets balance out over the course of a month -- not a day -- they'll be on the right track."
 Iron-Clad Nutrition,http://www.parenting.com/article/iron-clad-nutrition-21354364,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekDuring pregnancy a woman's daily requirement for iron doubles, from 15 to 30 milligrams -- and no wonder: Iron is a major component of hemoglobin, which carries oxygen throughout the body and to the placenta. It also enables both mother and fetus to form new red blood cells. Getting enough iron becomes especially important in the second and third trimesters, when maternal blood volume increases and the fetus begins to store the mineral for the first few months after birth.A shortage of iron can leave an expectant mom tired, pale, and infection-prone. If you have a deficiency, your doctor may prescribe an iron supplement in addition to your prenatal vitamin. However, you should still aim to eat at least four or five servings of iron-rich foods each day. For an extra boost, preparing foods in cast-iron cookware can increase their iron content. You can also enhance your body's absorption of iron by pairing foods containing iron with a source of vitamin C (a snack of raisins and orange juice, a tomato-and-ground beef pasta sauce), and combining meat sources of iron with nonmeat sources (as in beef-and-bean chili). Because the tannin in tea and the polyphenols in coffee can interfere with iron absorption, avoid drinking them with meals."

" Nutrition Labels, Decoded",http://www.parenting.com/article/nutrition-labels-decoded-1203711328503,"<span class=""blue10b""><b>Serving Size</b></span><br><b>Start here, since the rest of the label's info is based on this number.</b> You might have to do some quick math when it comes to food for kids: If your toddler snacks on only 1/2 cup of cereal and the serving size is 1 cup, adjust accordingly to find out what nutrients he's getting. Also crucial: the ""servings per container"" line. Since many snacks (like a 16-ounce bottle of juice) actually have two servings per container, you'll have to double all the numbers if you end up scarfing down the whole thing. <br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Calories</b></span><br>One of the least important numbers for kids under 5, if they're at a normal weight. ""Little kids are more tuned in to their hunger than we are, so they can usually regulate their own calories,"" says Jeannie Gazzaniga-Moloo, Ph.D., a dietitian in Sacramento, California, and spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association (ADA). <b>For school-age kids -- and younger, if they're overweight -- you'll want to pay closer attention to how many calories they're taking in.</b> The ADA's recommended calorie intake:<br><b>Ages 2-3:</b> 1,000 to 1,400 calories per day <br><b>Ages 4-8:</b> 1,200 to 1,800 calories per day (boys need slightly more calories, and so do really active kids) <br><b>Ages 9-13:</b> 1,600 to 2,200 calories per day for girls; 1,800 to 2,600 calories per day for boys.<br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Calories From Fat</b></span><br><b>Kids should get 30 to 35 percent of their daily calories from fat,</b> while adults should shoot for less than 30 percent. An easy way to calculate fat calories: Look for a low ""calories from fat"" number. For example, a 100-calorie snack should have fewer than 30 calories from fat. <br><br><b><span class=""blue10b"">Cholesterol</span></b><br><b>Both kids and adults need to take in around 300 mg of cholesterol per day</b>, in part to make the myelin sheath that surrounds the body's nerves. While it's true that too much cholesterol can build up in the arteries and cause heart disease, experts now know that trans and saturated fats play a bigger role in raising blood cholesterol than does the cholesterol in food. The bottom line: Shoot for foods low in cholesterol, but you don't have to avoid it at all costs. <br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Sodium</b></span><br>The daily recommended allowance for kids: <br><b>Ages 2-3:</b> 1,000 to 1,500 mg per day<br><b>Ages 4-8:</b> 1,200 to 1,900 mg per day <br><b>Ages 9-13:</b> 1,500 to 2,200 mg per day <br>Since sodium may raise blood pressure in some people, the <b>maximum recommended for adults is 2,300 mg</b> -- about one teaspoon of salt! Of course, we all consume far more than that thanks to the amount of processed foods we eat. (Just one cup of boxed mac and cheese has nearly 600 mg.) And since most restaurant food is typically higher in sodium, it's smart to limit sodium-rich foods at home. <br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Vitamins </b></span><br>Vitamins and minerals are essential for growing kids, but your child is likely getting most of what she needs as long as she really eats things from every food group.<b> The nutrients kids most often lack include vitamins A, B6, C, and D and the minerals calcium, iron, and zinc.</b> See the % Daily Value to find out if a food is a good source of the vitamins and minerals listed on the label.<br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>% Daily Value</b></span><br><b>The percentage of nutrients in a food, based on the Food and Drug Administration's recommended daily intake. </b>The percentages are keyed to a 2,000-calorie diet, though, so a quick way to figure out what your child is getting is to use the percentage as a clue to whether a food is high or low in certain nutrients. A food that's 5 percent or less is considered to be low in that nutrient; if it's between 10 percent and 19 percent, it's a good source; 20 percent or higher means it's an excellent source.<br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Fats</b></span><br>We all need some fat to absorb vitamins, help our internal organs work efficiently, and keep us feeling satisfied after meals -- and it's especially important for kids' brain development. <b>But it's the type of fat to zero in on here.</b> When you check out a label, look for a low saturated-fat content and little or no trans fat. For both adults and children over 2, fewer than 10 percent of daily calories should come from saturated fat. Shortcut: Try to limit -- or, better, avoid -- packaged foods with a saturated-fat content over 1.5 grams per serving.<br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Carbohydrates</b></span><br><b>Pay attention to total carbohydrates, as well as the amount of dietary fiber and sugars in a food.</b> For a good idea of the type of fiber and sugar it contains, check the ingredients list. Whole-grain fiber is ideal, and should be high on the list, while sugars (which may be hiding under names that end in ""ose,"" like sucrose and high-fructose corn syrup) should be lower. <br><br><span class=""blue10b""><b>Ingredients</b></span><br><b>These are always listed from the greatest to smallest quantity,</b> so the first three to five ingredients will give you a sense of how healthy a food is. ""In general, you want to look for those that are recognizable, like whole grains, fruits, and vegetables, and steer clear of anything that's hydrogenated, which signifies that it's a trans fat,"" says Gazzaniga- Moloo. What about those ingredients you can't pronounce? If there are lots, it probably means you're getting more preservatives than nutrients.<br><br><i>Meghan Rabbitt is a senior editor for</i> Natural Solutions<i> magazine.</i></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>"

 8 Ways Your Baby Says I Love You,http://www.parenting.com/8-ways-your-baby-says-i-love-you,"How do you know your <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">baby</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> loves you back? Sweet, surprising ways she shows itLet's be real. Babies this little are not going to give you the kind of feedback you might desperately wish for after that grueling labor and those sleepless nights. But as you and your baby get to know each other, you'll get glimmers that a bond is forming and that can be more meaningful than a big declaration of love. ""Attachment is a process,"" says Debbie Laible, Ph.D., a professor of psychology at Lehigh University. When you take care of your baby, he falls more in love with you every day and says thanks in his own <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/how-babies-show-their-love"">baby ways</a>.<strong>He knows you're you</strong><br>“Within a few weeks, babies can recognize their caregiver and they prefer her to other people,” says Alison Gopnik, Ph.D., author of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/s/?ie=UTF8&amp;keywords=the+philosophical+baby&amp;tag=googhydr-20&amp;index=aps&amp;hvadid=33558749985&amp;hvpos=1t1&amp;hvexid=&amp;hvnetw=g&amp;hvrand=15568618364359806974&amp;hvpone=&amp;hvptwo=&amp;hvqmt=e&amp;hvdev=c&amp;ref=pd_sl_ishqycmpy_e""><em>The Philosophical Baby</em></a> and a professor of psychology at the University of California, Berkeley. Partly, your little one's just following her nose: In one study, researchers put a nursing newborn between two breast pads, one belonging to her mother. The scent of Mom's milk was enough to get the baby to turn toward that pad.</br>Become the foremost expert on what your baby's various cries mean. Relentless and desperate usually means hunger, abrupt might mean pain, and more plaintive can signal discomfort. You'll figure it out through trial and error, eventually grasping nuances that will baffle outsiders. The better you know his language, the better you can meet his needs. “When a baby's distressed and his parents respond, he learns he can count on them for comfort and relief and that he matters,” says Linda Gilkerson, Ph.D., director of the Irving B. Harris Infant Studies Program at Erikson University. But don't worry if you can't always nail the wail: “You don't have to be perfect,” says Gilkerson. In fact, she says, research shows that caregivers are in perfect sync with their babies only about 40 percent of the time. What's more important is that you will learn to recognize and respond when your baby needs you. “Your baby learns ‘I can rely on Mom. Even if I cry for a little bit, she gets to me soon enough that I don't fall apart,’” Gilkerson says.<strong>She'll totally flirt with you</strong><br>“Within a month or so of being born, babies respond to the facial expressions of their mothers and without thinking about it, the moms start doing it right back,” says Gopnik. We're talking about the smiles, the meaningful looks, the coy looking away and back again (think back to ninth-grade study hall; you get the idea!). These goofy games appear to be as important in cementing a baby's attachment as your responses to her physical needs. At around 4 months, she'll also be unable to take her eyes off of you. And who can blame her? By then, she's gotten used to life on the outside, can suck and swallow and is physiologically more regulated (i.e., is no longer eating and sleeping like a jet-lagged traveler), so she can begin to pay attention to more than just her immediate bodily needs, explains Gilkerson.</br>Flirt back—and don't be afraid to use exaggerated expressions. “Face-to-face interaction is part of how babies learn about positive give-and-take,” says Gilkerson. Your child's starting to realize that with a single look, she can show you how happy she is that you're around—and that it's a feeling worth sharing, since you'll beam back.<strong>He smiles, even for a split second</strong><br>You know those people who say that your baby's early smiles are just gas or an involuntary reflex? Don't listen to them. Recent research indicates that an infant's grin may mean a lot more. The goofy newborn smiles may be your baby reflecting your own smile. He's instinctively building a bond with you.</br>The first true social smiles start brightening moms' days between 6 and 8 weeks. Your baby may smile when he sees your face -- or Dad's or a big sib's. He's starting to associate your face with feeling good. The bond deepens!<strong>He'll latch on to a lovey</strong><br>Babies often pick a favorite object, like a stuffed animal or a blankie, at around a year old. Gopnik explains that these transitional objects symbolize you and your affection, which explains the histrionics if you—heaven forbid!—put it in the wash for an hour. “It represents your love, but in a way your child can control,” she says.</br> Let your child keep his lovey close by in situations where he might feel insecure, if that's possible. Don't worry that there's some set time to get rid of it, as with a bottle. Chances are he won't be clutching it as he walks down the aisle on his wedding day (though, let's be honest, many of us still have Mr. Fuzzybear tucked away somewhere).<strong>She stares at you, so intently it's practically rude</strong><br>Right from birth, a baby can recognize his mother's face, voice and smell, says Laible. The next step is linking those sounds and smells he trusts with something he can see. That's why he'll start studying your face as if he's trying to memorize it. In a way, he is. He's making sure he knows what comfort -- and love -- looks like. So next time you catch your baby's eyes locked on you, give him time to drink you in.</br><strong>He gives you smooches (sort of)</strong><br>Sometime around a year old, your baby might start giving kisses—and they probably won't be chaste pecks. Expect wet and sloppy ones that land (sometimes hard!) on whatever part of you is closest. ""When I ask my daughter Evvi for a smooch, she crunches up her nose, tilts back her head and then swoops up to my face and plants her lips on mine,"" VA. ""She totally melts my heart!""</br>Evvi's enthusiasm shows she's been paying attention to the way her mom shows affection, and she wants to do the same, says Richard Gallagher, Ph.D., director of the Parenting Institute at the NYU Child Study Center. Babies are eager learners when it comes to physical affection, and there's no one they'd rather practice on than Mom and Dad.This is when it starts to get really fun. Babies past the 6-month mark are a lot more aware of the world around them and are developing new abilities practically every day. So your baby can now show her big-time affection for you in some pretty adorable ways:<strong>She holds up her arms so you'll pick her up</strong><br>Kerry Smith recently noticed that her 6-month-old son, Leo, has a new way of expressing whom he wants the most. ""When someone else is holding him and I walk up, he'll twist his body toward me and hold out his arms,"" says the Prescott Valley, AZ, mom of three.</br>Many babies adore being held right from the start, but it takes about six months until they have the physical and cognitive abilities to ask for a pick-me-up. It's a body-language expression of how much they've come to trust and adore their parents. And it can be enough, especially on one of those endless days, to make your heart lurch, too.<strong>She'll pull away from you, and then run back</strong><br>You'll start seeing this as soon as your baby crawls. “You're your child's warm, cozy, secure base. But she's also thinking ‘Hey, wait! I can crawl! I want to get out there and find out what's in the world!’” Gopnik explains. So she does, until she gets insecure. Then she's all “Let me go back and make sure Mom's still there.”</br>Freedom to explore—and then bungee back to a safe place—is what this is about, so let her do it. Of course, for many moms, this is harder than it sounds. But instead of hovering, put your energies into some extra babyproofing.<strong>She's bouncing, wiggling and cheering for you</strong><br>The way your baby acts when she sees you after a few hours -- or a few minutes? You'd be forgiven for thinking you're a bit of a rock star. This glee isn't just cute; it's a sign of the deep attachment that's grown between you.</br>On the flip side are your baby's wails of distress when you leave. It's part of her development, and she'll learn that you always come back. She understands object permanence now (you exist even when you're not around), so it's rough for her to know that the object of her affection is out there and not here to snuggle.Babies this age do their emotions big, so whether it's heartbreak that you're gone or earthshaking excitement that you're back, one thing is clear: You are loved. By a tiny, crazy little person, yes, but loved.As your baby goes from blob to bright-eyed to whirlwind, the way he shows his love gets more complicated, too. In the early toddler stage, your child is exploring his little world and testing boundaries and he relies on you—yep, because he loves you—to help him. It's a busy time for a toddler, and that's why the ways he expresses his love can seem indirect:<strong>He does what you do</strong><br>Whoever said imitation is the sincerest form of flattery must have known a toddler or two. Whether he's lugging a briefcase down the stairs or cooing over a baby doll, he's definitely showing how cool he thinks you are. Like all people—adults included!—toddlers imitate the activities and behaviors of the people they love most, says Laible.</br><strong>Making a beeline for you when he's hurt</strong><br>When Emily Cook of Calgary, Alberta, gets a scrape or a sniffle, nothing makes her feel better like rocking on her mom's lap. The fact that your toddler runs to you for comfort—and then can dry his eyes and run off—means he loves and needs you.</br>Of course, you may also notice that your kid doesn't have to be that hurt to come to you wailing. Even a minor accident can make for big drama if Mom's around to see it. ""Emily puts on this pout, coupled with dramatic sniffling. Then she throws in a big, unblinking stare that says 'Poor me!'?"" says her mom, Heather. Yes, there's a plea for attention in there, but it really does make your baby feel better to get proof that you love him as much as he loves<strong>He reserves bad behavior just for you</strong><br>What mom hasn't heard ""He was an angel!"" when picking up a toddler from a sitter, then witnessed downright devilish behavior mere minutes later? Toddlers test limits with abandon—but most often with those people they love and trust. This isn't exactly the warmest, fuzziest way your child will say he loves you. But that's exactly what he's doing. ""You know you've done your job well if he can hold it together in public but saves his blowups for you,"" says Elizabeth Short, Ph.D., professor of psychology at Case Western Reserve University. ""He knows that you're safe—he can act up and you'll still love him."" You may never <em>welcome</em> a meltdown, but at least you can stop thinking your thrashing, screaming toddler is out to get you. He isn't. He just loves you sooo much.</br><strong>He'll freak out when you leave</strong><br>Starting around his first birthday, and often continuing until he's 3 or so, your child may get upset when you have to part—and rejoice when you return. “Separation anxiety is a sign he knows that the person he loves is different from others, and he's beginning to have object permanence—an understanding that people and things don't disappear the minute they're out of sight,” says Gilkerson.</br>This is one behavior you don't want to reinforce. Because, let's face it, it can be excruciating to listen to your child's wails as you leave him in daycare. Offer reassurance: Say “I know you'll miss me, but Mrs. Rosie will take great care of you and I'll be back to pick you up.” Rest assured that he'll be fine, says Gopnik, and know that you're teaching him that he can count on you to come back for him later.<strong>She wants to marry one of her friends at school</strong><br>At 3 or 4, she's figured out that getting married means you love someone. Even if she doesn't push for wedlock with her pals, she'll start to love certain friends in a way she didn't when she was younger than 2 and it was all about her parents. “It's an extension of the bond she feels with her intimate caregivers,” says Gopnik. As kids enter kindergarten, their friendships become more central to their lives. Wanting to marry a buddy isn't a direct expression of her love for you, but it shows you've created a caring environment for her, both at school and at home.</br>Arrange playdates and praise her when she does things like sharing or hugging. Just be aware that some kids go a little overboard with displays of affection. Teaching your child how to recognize when someone's feeling a bit smothered (“Sweetie, see how she's pulling away?”) will help her learn to respect others' boundaries.<em>Meagan Francis, a mom of four, is the author of </em><a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1592576737?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=parentingcom&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=1592576737"" target=""_new"">Table for Eight: Raising a Large Family in a Small-Family World</a>.<a href=""https://secure.parents.com/order/?containerName=i5bg4rm90&amp;psrc=I5BG4RM90""><img alt="""" draggable=""false"" src=""http://images.parenting.mdpcdn.com/sites/parenting.com/files/openpage/pmm_SI_600x400.jpg"" style=""height:400px; width:600px""/></a>"
 Healthy Bites,http://www.parenting.com/article/healthy-bites,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekAs winter's chill sets in, so does the craving for warm, hearty <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">meals</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>. But as satisfying as they are, classic comfort foods like spaghetti and meatballs and chicken pot pie generally pack way too much fat. Fortunately, you can easily slim down some perennial favorites -- without losing the flavor:Keep in mind that not all cold-weather dishes serve up high amounts of fat, so don't overlook pot roast and beef stew -- which can be made with leaner cuts of meat -- and mushroom barley and lentil soups -- which are made with the tiniest bit of fat (usually just a little oil to saute the onions).Need one more reason to consider breastfeeding your baby? Research suggests it's then easier to introduce solids, because infants who nurse are more willing to try new foods.According to studies by Leann Birch, Ph.D., a children's nutrition researcher at Pennsylvania State University, breast milk transmits food flavors from a mother's diet, which helps ready an infant for ""real"" foods. Birch and her colleagues found that breastfed babies more readily accept foods like peas and green beans than formula-fed babies, who are exposed to the same formula flavor day after day.What if your baby is formula-fed? Don't worry: The more often you offer a new food, the more likely it is your child will eat it.In some families, licking the mixing bowl is as much a holiday tradition as baking festive cookies and cakes. The problem: Most raw batter contains uncooked eggs -- the primary source of the bacteria salmonella -- so even a finger swipe means risking a run-in with food poisoning.Though the odds of getting salmonella poisoning from raw eggs are relatively small, the number of cases in the United States is rising because of strong new strains of the bacteria, as well as unsafe food-handling practices. Toddlers, pregnant women, and those with a weak immune system are particularly vulnerable to infection. Symptoms can appear from 12 to 36 hours after eating and include abdominal pains, diarrhea, vomiting, chills, fever, and headache.Your family's best line of defense, according to the Food and Drug Administration: Steer clear of uncooked eggs in raw batter and dough, and avoid using them in recipes that don't require cooking, such as homemade mayonnaise, salad dressings, and sauces.If your child's pleas to lick the mixing bowl are just too great to bear, consider using a pasteurized egg product, located next to the eggs at most grocery stores. It will have undergone a heating process that kills salmonella. Another way to appease kids who are begging for batter: Buy premade cookie batter or ice cream with cookie dough. The eggs in these products are also pasteurized.All produce is not created equal: To get the most vitamin A from your fruits and vegetables, buy the darkest orange, red, yellow, and leafy green ones you can find. Vitamin A -- especially plentiful in carrots, tomatoes, spinach, sweet potatoes, and winter squash -- helps keep vision sharp and skin, bones, and teeth in top form.<strong>Q.</strong> Is it okay for a constantly hungry preschooler to snack all day, even if it lessens his appetite for meals?<strong>A.</strong> Kids' energy needs are about two to three times that of adults, but they don't have adult-size stomachs to eat what they need in one sitting, so snacking is definitely in order. The key is to make sure most of what he munches on is nutritious. To teach good eating habits, consider limiting him to two or three scheduled snacks a day. ""A child who nibbles all the time can fall in the trap of eating when he's not hungry, which can lead to overeating later on,"" says Patty Morse, a pediatric dietitian at Loyola University Medical Center, in Chicago.Try offering a bite two to three hours after breakfast or lunch, but at least two hours before his next meal. If he's hungry, an evening snack is fine as well. When possible, have him sit at a table -- not in front of the TV or computer. Distractions can make a child feel he hasn't really tasted his food, which means he's likely to feel hungry again sooner.<em>Daryn Eller is working on a book about boosting energy.</em>"
 5 Simple Ways To Prevent Illness,http://www.parenting.com/article/5-simple-ways-to-prevent-illness,"The cold and flu season may be in full swing, but that doesn't mean the whole <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">family</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> has to succumb to days or weeks of sniffling, coughing, and achy misery. The key to staying healthy: Keep your bodies in top form, ready to fight off illness, by eating well; getting enough sleep, exercise, and fresh air; and being savvy about fending off germs. Here, tips on how to strengthen your family's overall health.The evidence is clear: Kids and adults need a diverse diet, one chock-full of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and protein, to keep immunity high.""Go for the nutritional superstars  -- most often foods high in vitamins A, B, C, and E  -- that truly help boost immunity,"" says Annemarie Colbin, founder of the Natural Gourmet Cookery School and author of <em>Food and Healing</em>. She recommends eating plenty of orange and yellow produce (one or two of the recommended five total daily fruit and vegetable servings), which are naturally high in disease-fighting flavonoids and carotenoids  -- such as butternut and acorn squashes, sweet potatoes, and carrots, or brightly colored fruits like kiwis, mangoes, clementines, and pink grapefruit.Drinking 100 percent fruit juices is a good way to up your vitamin intake. To make sure you get a wide range of nutrients, vary the type of juice that you serve: Instead of giving your toddler a daily dose of apple juice, go for a mango-guava mix or banana-kiwi blend. Most supermarkets now offer ready-to-serve exotic juice combinations.If you can't get fresh fruits and vegetables, are canned or frozen as good? ""In general, yes, although frozen vegetables and fruits are slightly more likely to retain valuable nutrients than canned varieties, which may leach out some vitamins during processing,"" says Michael Morse, M.D., professor of clinical family medicine at the University of Virginia. ""But since the difference is negligible, canned produce is fine.""Minerals also play a key role in health. Many kid staples, such as cereals and breads, are fortified with extra vitamins, but don't contain substantial minerals, says Luke Bucci, Ph.D., a nutritionist in Salt Lake City. So include foods high in calcium (milk, yogurt, tofu, cheese, broccoli); potassium (bananas, baked potatoes, raisins, grapes); zinc and protein (lamb chops and other red meats, seafood, peanut butter, chicken); and magnesium (brown rice, whole-wheat bagels, pastas, milk, yogurt, nuts, and seeds).The mercury is dipping. The wind is whipping. Why bother to bundle up and head out? Research shows that spending time outside can promote better sleep, boost overall wellness, and may improve your mood. ""Being outdoors in daylight for as little as twenty minutes a day can make a big difference in raising your energy level and preventing the winter blues,"" says Norman Rosenthal, M.D., director of seasonal studies at the National Institute of Mental Health and author of <em>Winter Blues</em>. While studies show that bright morning light offers the most benefits, he says, ""getting out in the afternoon may help as well.""Depression caused by seasonal affective disorder, known as SAD, occurs in only about 3 percent of children. For kids who do develop it, it has many similarities to the adult form, such as an inability to concentrate and irritability. Many more kids and adults experience a milder seasonal sadness. With either condition, research suggests that both adults and children would respond well to regular exposure to outdoor light.Just having to wrestle your 2-year-old into her jacket and mittens can deter you from getting out  -- but the extra effort is worth it. ""Most of us are surprised that once outdoors, away from the recirculated air and heat that fill most modern homes and offices, we feel refreshed,"" says Dr. Morse. And the more active you and your kids are  -- whether it's building a snowman or heading out for a brisk stroll to get milk instead of taking the car  -- the better you'll all feel.Although people's sleep requirements differ  -- from 8 hours on average for adults to at least 13 hours for most toddlers  -- experts believe that prolonged lack of sleep (causing you to nod off any chance you get, impairing your ability to concentrate, and slowing your reaction time) or a disruption of sleep patterns can impair immunity in adults and children. ""Some studies show that being sleep-deprived limits the body's natural killer-cell activity  -- white blood cells, which help battle disease,"" says Michael Bonnet, Ph.D., director of the sleep laboratory at the Dayton Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center, in OH. And in overtired 4- and 5-year-olds, he says, fatigue appears to cause irritability, hyperactivity, and night terrors.To cope with exhaustion and maximize sleep efficiency, Claudio Stampi, M.D., director of the Chronobiology Research Institute, in Newton, MA, suggests getting sleep in small doses. ""The best way to boost alertness is to try to grab a twenty- or thirty-minute nap,"" he says, so doze off for a little while on the train, behind a closed office door if you have one, or in your car in a parking lot.However, though catnaps will definitely help you make up for a sleep deficit, short naps that last longer than 30 or 40 minutes will only make you groggier. But people with more time on their hands can go for a longer snooze, sleeping for 90-minute intervals (or an hour and a half, three hours, four and a half hours, and so on).Why the specific time recommendations? ""Sleep occurs in ninety-minute cycles, so napping this way allows you to go into a deep sleep. At the end of each cycle the body enters a lighter sleep phase, enabling you to wake up more refreshed,"" explains Dr. Stampi.Don't underestimate the value of short snatches of restorative time: a warm bath or a ten-minute foot massage before bed can relax you. For little ones, try a whole-body massage with unscented oil. And don't overlook bedtime rituals  -- same time, same place, same stories  -- to help ready toddlers, older kids, and even adults for slumber.Close quarters. Snow days. These long winter months can get to even the calmest parent  -- and leave your body as stressed out as your brain. ""There's extensive research showing that stress is a primary factor in susceptibility to colds and gastrointestinal disorders and may be a contributor to chronic pain syndromes, such as arthritis,"" says Henry Dreher, author of <em>The Immune Power Personality</em>.A key strategy for combatting stress: Get moving. Regular, moderate exercise  -- aerobic or strength training  -- can improve the quality of sleep, lift your mood, and help you battle winter weight gain. ""It's probably the single best way to keep your energy up and your stress level down, which is doubly important during cold and flu season,"" says Ray Sahelian, M.D., a family physician and author of <em>The Common Cold Cure</em>. In fact, researchers at Appalachian State University, in Boone, NC, found that previously sedentary women who started walking five days a week for 35 to 45 minutes reported about half the number of days with cold symptoms as women who didn't walk. When it's too cold to exercise outdoors, consider swimming at a local Y that offers a babysitting service, walking on a gymnasium track, or ice-skating at an indoor rink with your kids.Lastly, try to check your anxiety at the front door. ""An emotionally healthy, caring environment is at the root of staying well,"" says Dr. Sahelian. Several studies show that stress makes children more susceptible to colds and flu, and lowers their ability to fight off viruses, particularly upper-respiratory illness. So make sleep, good nutrition, and exercise a priority, and do a reality check every week: Are you or your kids overtired and chronically cranky? Are your and your family's schedules too hectic? If so, recharge by taking a mental health day or by freeing up a weekend to simply do nothing."
 The Truth About Healthy Eating,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-truth-about-healthy-eating,"Here, the truth behind some common myths so you can make sure you feed your children healthy foods that will help them grow. Just remember: Since kids have different body types and caloric requirements, you should talk to your pediatrician about your child's particular needs.<i>William Sears, M.D., is a contributing editor to </i>Parenting.<i> His latest book, </i>The Successful Child: What Parents Can Do to Help Kids Turn Out Well,<i> will be published next month by Little, Brown and Company.</i>Kids typically don't eat large helpings, but they still need calories to grow. Fats can help, since they pack the most calories in the smallest volume of food, providing nine calories per gram, compared with four calories per gram of carbohydrates or proteins.How much fat do kids need? During the first two years, it should make up at least 50 percent of their daily calories (infants get all the fat they need from breast milk or fortified formula). Children ages 2 to 5 should get about 30 percent. However, this doesn't mean you should start to feed your kids french fries and snack cakes  -- it's important that they eat the right kinds of fat. American children tend to eat an excess of unhealthy ones (animal fats and hydrogenated fats often found in junk food) but not enough of the good-for-you variety, omega-3s, which are found mostly in fish and vegetable oils. Omega-3 fats may be linked to improved eyesight, higher IQ, and increased attention span in kids.Grazing (a few small meals throughout the day) is a healthy way to eat. When a child, or an adult for that matter, gorges on a lot of food at once (especially foods high in sugar), blood sugar may rise, which sends a message to the pancreas: ""You've got too much sugar in your blood  -- let's reduce it."" The pancreas then releases insulin, which drives the excess sugar out of the bloodstream and into the cells. As a result, the child's blood-sugar level may plummet. Sticking to a normal schedule of meals and snacks is the best course of action. Here are two ways my wife, Martha, and I helped our kids master the fine art of grazing:But the kind of carbohydrate your child eats is extremely important. Whether a carb is considered healthy or not depends on how it behaves in the bloodstream. Some are called simple carbohydrates; these are so small that they pass quickly through the intestines into the bloodstream and cause the blood sugar to rise rapidly and then plummet. It's best to limit these sugars, called sucrose (also known as table sugar) and corn syrup, as much as possible. They're the ones found in candy, frosting, cookies, soft drinks, and almost all packaged treats. And don't forget: Many ""low-fat"" packaged foods are surprisingly high in sugar, so make sure that you read the labels before stocking up on these seemingly innocent sweets.On the other end of the sugar spectrum are complex carbohydrates, or starches, which include vegetables, legumes, and whole grains. Since they're bigger than simple sugars, they take longer to digest, acting like a time-release energy capsule that steadily enters the bloodstream and maintains blood-sugar levels. Also, they don't leave the stomach as quickly, making a child feel satisfied longer and less likely to load up on unhealthy snacks.Besides complex carbohydrates, other good sugar options for kids are fructose (found in fruits) and lactose (found in dairy products), both of which enter the bloodstream more slowly than simple sugars.If you make sure that your little one gets the proper fats and the proper sugars in his diet, he'll automatically get enough protein too.What if your child absolutely refuses to eat one particular food group, such as vegetables? Here are some tricks to get him to try the unwanted fare:I've observed in my practice that kids who are fed nutritious foods from a young age tend not to overdose on junk when they get older. That's because they've become accustomed to healthy tastes, while junk foods are foreign and more likely to cause an upset stomach. Kids who were brought up on junk are more apt to binge on it because their bodies have adapted to the artificial flavors of high-fat, processed packaged foods.I tested this theory on my own kids, who were put on strictly nutritious diets for the first few years. Of course, when they got older they still wanted fast food, soda, and other sweets. But they wouldn't overindulge, as other kids did, because they'd start to have an upset stomach earlier on.Some teaching strategies that have worked for me:Parents are the nutritionists of the family, and it can seem a daunting job. But armed with the right information about wise food choices and what kids really need, you'll find it easier to make the proper decisions about what to feed your child."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Frequent Nose Bleeds,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-frequent-nose-bleeds,"A. This is particularly common during the late-fall and winter months. Central heating lowers the humidity in the room air, and this dries out the lining of the nose, leaving kids more susceptible to nosebleeds. In addition to what you're already doing, try these nose-comforting remedies:Nasal allergies are one of the most common causes of nosebleeds in children. Remove all dust-collectors and stuffed or pet animals from your child's sleeping environment. Install a HEPA air filter in your child's bedroom. Use hypoallergenic bedding and either turn off the central heating in your child's bedroom (more on this, below) or put a filter on the heating vent. Above all, don't allow smokers near your child, as smoke is a huge nasal irritant.I suggest you switch to a warm-mist vaporizer instead of a cool-mist one. The hot steam will usually provide enough heat for an average-sized child's bedroom, letting you turn off the central heating at night. The increased humidity in the bedroom air will moisten his nasal passages. Be sure to put the vaporizer out of Jacob's reach, since it can pose a burn hazard.Another remedy for nasal congestion and nosebleeds, especially during the winter months, is what I call a ""nose hose."" Spritz some saltwater nose drops or saline nasal spray into each nostril. Do this several times a day, especially before bedtime and upon awakening in the morning. If you sit him on your lap so he is upright it won't bother him as much as if you try to do this when he's lying down. Saline nasal spray is available without prescription at your pharmacy, or you can make your own saltwater nose drops with a quarter teaspoon of salt to eight ounces of water.This is another common cause of nosebleeds, especially among older children. In fact, instead of asking children if they <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-icky-habit"">pick their noses</a>, I ask them ""Which finger do you use to pick your nose?"" Children tend to pick their noses just because they itch. Hopefully some of the allergy-proofing techniques will reduce the irritants in the air and reduce nasal irritation. But if he still picks his nose, another simple trick to discourage nose picking is to keep his fingernails trimmed short.You mentioned Jacob's nutrophil (white blood cell) count was low. I recommend you cut artificially sweetened foods and beverages out of his diet. These foods can suppress the body's immune system. I also recommend adding foods with omega 3 fats to his diet. Not only will these boost your child's immune system, but they can also improve the integrity of blood vessels. The best source is coldwater fish, such as wild salmon, but you can get omega 3's from plant sources such as flax oil, as well.Usually nosebleeds in toddlers are easy to control with the above measures. But occasionally the structure of a child's nose can make him predisposed to nosebleeds. What happens is the blood vessels lining the nasal septum —the bone dividing the two nostrils—are so prominent and easily irritated that they bleed easily. When this is the case, a pediatric ENT specialist can coagulate these vessels to keep them from bleeding."
 Is Fish Okay for Babies?,http://www.parenting.com/article/should-babies-eat-fish,"The nutritional benefits of Omega 3 <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">foods</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> like salmon, tuna and other fish to infants.As a pediatrician and father of eight, I've realized how much children's health and behavior is affected, for better or worse, by what they eat. Of course, you already know how important a balanced diet full of whole grains, vegetables, fruit and lean proteins is, but when it comes to babies and toddlers, one thing I always found missing from their diet was fish. Parents didn't seem to think it was a ""baby"" food.But over the years, I'd been reading more and more about the benefits of omega-3 fatty acids, essential nutrients found in seafood. Study after study was proving their contribution to infant brain development and more. I began ""prescribing"" omega-3's to my patients in 2000 by encouraging their parents to offer them more fish. Since then, I've only grown more convinced that omega-3's are the head-to-toe nutrient because they're good for nearly every organ of a child's body, from the brain to the skin. Most parents, however, are unsure about feeding their babies fish, which is the richest source of DHA, the healthiest type of omega-3 fatty acid for infants. Here's why—and how—to ""go fish,"" for both your baby and you!What eating fish can do for you and your baby:In the '80s and early '90s, initial research suggested that infants who received DHA-enriched formula experienced improved cognitive development, leading the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, in 2001, to allow infant formula to be supplemented with the brain-building omega-3, DHA. Since then, the proof keeps piling up. A 2003 study in the journal Pediatrics found that mothers who took omega-3 supplements during pregnancy and lactation increased their children's cognitive abilities at 4 years of age. In 2005, another study revealed that schoolchildren who were given omega-3 supplements showed improved reading and spelling scores. Since a child's brain grows fastest prenatally and continues to grow rapidly in the first year of life, tripling in size by the end of the first year, this is an ideal time to get DHA into his diet.Another study found that toddlers whose mothers had higher DHA blood levels at delivery were better able to maintain focus on an object compared with tots whose mothers had lower DHA levels.DHA has been shown to help sharpen vision in infants.Research has shown that adults who consume more omega-3's have a lower rate of mood disorders and that women who eat fish high in these fatty acids during pregnancy suffer less postpartum depression. Why? Omega-3's may act in the brain to raise levels of ""happy"" hormones such as dopamine and serotonin, the neurotransmitters in the brain that are also targeted by some prescription antidepressants. I'll eat to that!These fantastic fatty acids have also been linked to improved immunity. In one study, Danish toddlers who consumed formula supplemented with fish oil had much higher levels of a protein that's key to healthy immune function than those who drank plain formula or cow's milk.Omega-3's can decrease inflammation in all parts of the body, including the skin. Serving a little salmon or chunk-light tuna to your baby before 9 months may actually help to protect him from devel­oping the allergic skin condition, according to a Swedish study.Answers to the most common questions parents ask me:Except for shellfish, you can serve your baby puréed or mashed fish as early as 6 months when he starts eating solids. Fish may seem like a ""grown-up"" food, but it is the ideal fare for infants. Read on for serving ideas.Oily fish such as chunk-light tuna, sardines, halibut and salmon are the best sources of healthy omega-3's. But sardines aren't practical for feeding to a baby, and halibut and tuna are higher in mercury. That makes salmon the best source of DHA (again, the star omega-3 fatty acid) and, in my opinion, the healthiest fish for kids and adults alike. But almost all seafood contains omega-3's, so try giving your baby a variety of low-mercury fish. Pollock is used in most commercial fish sticks and is another good choice.Some fish are high in mercury and other pollutants. Check out the ""Mercury Meter,"" a guide to mercury levels in commonly consumed fish, from the Natural Resources Defense Council. Try to stick to the fish in the ""low mercury"" category, though infants can eat up to three ounces per week of the fish listed as ""moderate mercury"" (adults can eat up to six ounces). Avoid those fish in the ""high"" category altogether. Finally, shellfish can be allergenic; your doctor may recommend holding off until age 2.Omega-3's are the standout nutrient, but fish is also a wonderful source of lean protein. It's high in vitamin D, too, an important vitamin for strong bones that many children are lacking, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics.I recommend that infants get around 300 milligrams of DHA per day, more than half of which they can get from their regular daily feedings of breast milk or formula fortified with DHA. On top of that, try to give your solids-eating tot a total of about two ounces of wild salmon per week. Once your baby is off formula and/or breast milk, try to up her amount of wild salmon to six or seven ounces per week. If you find it difficult to reach that amount, consider a supplement to make up the difference. Ask your doctor for a recommendation, or try my own DHA liquid called Go Fish (find retailers at <a class=""vglnk"" href=""http://Drsearshealthykids.com"" rel=""nofollow""><span>Drsearshealthykids</span><span>.</span><span>com</span></a>).You want to be careful that you're not consuming too much mercury but also getting a healthy amount of DHA. Stick to the recommendations already given in terms of how much fish you eat and, in addition, make sure your prenatal vitamin contains DHA (most do). Try to get at least 300 milligrams per day. For reference, the amount of DHA and other omega-3's in six ounces of wild Alaskan salmon is around 2,000 milligrams.Doubtful your baby will eat fish? Start with salmon, and try these tips:Pop open a can of boneless wild salmon, and dole out bites to your baby (no need to cook it!). Blend the salmon flakes into mac 'n' cheese or mashed potatoes. Another option: HappyBaby sells a frozen puree of wild salmon, lentils and sweet potatoes (find retailers at <a href=""http://www.happybabyfood.com/"" target=""_blank"">Happybabyfood.com</a>).Puree cooked salmon (canned or fresh) with lemon, olive oil and seasonings then spread it on bread or crackers.My daughter, Hayden, makes delicious breaded salmon strips that her son loves. Just as you would with chicken fingers, dip inch-wide strips of salmon fillet into beaten eggs and coat them with a mixture of whole-wheat flour, whole-wheat bread crumbs, parmesan cheese and a dash of salt. Then bake the strips for about eight minutes. However you prepare it, offer fish to your baby from the start, and it will be a favorite food.Learn more about <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/dha-a-smart-supplement"">DHA for kids</a>"
 You’re Expecting. Congratulations! Now What?,http://www.parenting.com/article/youre-expecting-now-what,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekHow to get your next 9 months off to the <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">best</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> start possibleWhen Rebecca Brandt's home pregnancy test came out positive, one of the first things she did was call her ob-gyn to schedule an appointment for the next day. ""I couldn't wait to confirm the results, and I already had a lot of questions about diet, exercise, and whether it would be safe to take over-the-counter medicines,"" says the Portland, Oregon, mom, whose daughter was born 15 months ago. But to Brandt's surprise, her doctor wasn't in nearly the rush that she was; she was told that he wouldn't need to see her for another two weeks, when she'd already be two months into the pregnancy. ""I asked the nurse if she at least had some guidelines to send me, but she had nothing. So I just stopped taking Advil for my occasional back pain and hoped for the best,"" says Brandt.Indeed, many doctors wait to see moms-to-be until 8 or even 12 weeks into a pregnancy. Why not sooner? Home pregnancy tests are extremely reliable; also, before two months there's no fetal heartbeat and it's too early to do an accurate pelvic exam. But that doesn't mean you shouldn't start taking steps now to make your pregnancy - and the months following it - as healthy and seamless as possible.Here's what you need to know and do as soon as you discover there's a baby on the way.If there was ever a time to eat right, it's in the first weeks of pregnancy. This is when a baby's bones, organs, and nervous system begin to form, and a well-balanced diet helps them develop properly, according to Marcos Pupkin, M.D., chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Mercy Medical Center, in Baltimore. One way you can help yourself to the right mix of nutrients: Take prenatal vitamins. Your doctor can recommend a brand to you over the phone before your exam. If morning sickness is making you feel too queasy to stomach them, try taking them at a different time of day when you're feeling better.But if you haven't taken any prenatal vitamins or paid attention to your diet until now, don't panic. ""Most babies are born healthy even when Mom hasn't been sticking to a strict regimen,"" says Andrew Rubenstein, M.D., assistant clinical professor of obstetrics, gynecology, and reproductive science at Hackensack University Medical Center, in New Jersey.Now and throughout the pregnancy, here's what to aim for in the foods you eat:<strong>Protein</strong> 60 grams per day. That's one 4-ounce serving of cooked poultry, meat, or fish (about the size of your palm), two tablespoons of peanut butter, and three 8-ounce servings of milk or yogurt.When I was pregnant, I munched on shelled sunflower seeds that I kept at my desk (one-quarter cup has eight grams of protein). Bonus: They settled my stomach.<strong>Calcium</strong> At least 1,000 milligrams per day. Three to four servings of dairy products should do it. One serving is eight ounces of milk or yogurt, one ounce of hard cheese (such as cheddar or swiss), or one cup of yogurt.<strong>Complex carbohydrates</strong> Six servings of fruits and veggies and at least six servings of breads, cereals, rice, or pasta per day. One serving of produce can be a cup of raw leafy greens, a half cup of cooked fruits or vegetables, one medium-size piece of fruit, or a half cup of juice. A slice of bread, a cup of cereal, or a half cup of cooked rice or pasta counts as one serving of grains.<strong>Folate (or folic acid)</strong> At least 400 micrograms per day. One bowl of Cheerios provides 50 percent of what you need. Other good sources of this nutrient are enriched grain products, orange juice, and spinach.<em>Click ahead for Exercise and Food Safety Tips</em>Fatigue may make you feel like sitting out the next nine months on the couch, but exercise is a great way to energize. It also controls weight gain, keeps abdominal muscles toned (important for preventing backaches as your uterus expands), and helps prevent constipation and premature delivery. You'll also be thankful for the extra strength and stamina you've gained when it's time to push the baby out.Stick with activities that are easy on the joints, such as walking, swimming, or cycling, since hormone changes make you more prone to strains and sprains. Thirty minutes of exercise three or four times a week is an ideal amount; though not if it means pushing yourself to the point of exhaustion.Those same hormones that loosen your joints can do a number on your mouth as well. A mere week or two after sperm meets egg, your gums become more sensitive to plaque. If it's not removed regularly, you may develop gum disease, which can contribute to premature labor or low birth weight, according to several recent studies.If you're not in the habit already, make sure you brush your teeth at least twice a day and after meals if possible, recommends Cindy Flanagan, a dentist in private practice in Houston. Floss daily as well, and follow that up by rinsing with an alcohol-free antiseptic mouthwash. If your gums start to become inflamed and tender, see your dentist. She may recommend more frequent professional cleaning while you're expecting.You already know to steer clear of alcohol and cigarettes, but you may not be aware of other behavior that might be risky.While most ob-gyns say it's safe to take acetaminophen and many antacids, check with your doctor before using any drug; cough syrups, sleep aids, and other over-the-counter products may contain ingredients that can harm a developing baby. If you're on a prescription medication, don't wait until your first prenatal exam to talk to your doctor. He may want you to stay on course, or he may decide to reduce your dosage or switch you to a different medicine altogether.The seemingly harmless task of changing your cat's litter box is actually potentially hazardous. Cat feces can contain the parasite that causes toxoplasmosis, an infection that creates flulike symptoms in grown-ups but potential hearing, vision, or even brain damage in unborn babies. The risk is highest if a woman gets sick during the first trimester. The parasite can also contaminate raw or underdone meat, so cook meat to at least 160 degrees before eating and always wash hands with soap and water after handling raw meat.Foods to avoid: unpasteurized milk or juice, soft cheeses (such as brie, feta, and roquefort), and bagged salads. These may contain listeria, a type of bacteria that can cause miscarriage. Deli meats may also carry listeria, so even though they're cooked, heat to steaming before you eat them.Cross raw seafood off your prenatal diet as well; it may contain the parasite that causes hepatitis A.As for those caffeine-containing espressos, cappuccinos, and sodas, moderation is key. While recent studies have found no link between caffeine and birth defects, caffeine does draw fluid and calcium from your body. ""It probably won't harm your baby,"" says Oliver Jones, M.D., an ob-gyn in private practice in Denver, ""but it can't hurt to cut it out or limit yourself to one eight-ounce caffeinated drink a day.""<em>Click ahead for more Pre-Baby To-Dos</em>Your ob-gyn may have handled your routine gynecological care for years - and perhaps even helped you through a previous pregnancy - but now's the time to decide whether she's the one you want for these nine months. Ask yourself, <em>Are we on similar wavelengths on prenatal testing, episiotomies, and epidurals? Is the office staff friendly and accessible? Does she take the time to give clear, thoughtful responses to my questions?</em>""You should never have to walk out of your doctor's office with unanswered concerns,"" says Dr. Rubenstein. ""If you're not comfortable with your doctor, now's a good time to switch. Check with friends for a recommendation, or call your local hospital and ask to speak to a nurse in the maternity ward. Labor and delivery nurses work with ob-gyns day in and day out - they know who's good.""Having a baby costs a bundle. ""The less you owe, the better,"" says Peter Finch, coauthor of <em>How to Raise Kids Without Going Broke.</em> Eliminate as much debt as possible by chipping away at loans and credit card balances or by transferring all of your balances to one low-interest-rate account, and begin paying it off.Aim to bulk up your savings as well. The earlier you start, the more money you'll have stashed away come delivery day. The easiest, and surest, way to save a lot of money when you're in a hurry: Have a set dollar amount automatically deducted from each paycheck and deposited directly into your bank account or a mutual fund.""Maternity leave may seem like a long way off when you're only a few weeks pregnant, but it's not too early to begin thinking about how much time off you'd like and can afford,"" says Carol Buckler, coauthor of <em>Everything a Working Mother Needs to Know.</em> ""There's a lot to consider.""While you probably won't want to tell your supervisor about the pregnancy until you've reached the second trimester - when the risk of miscarriage is largely behind you - you can use this time to check out your company's maternity-leave policy. Read the employee handbook, or discreetly ask colleagues with young kids. ""They should be able to explain how the employer managed their leave and give you the inside scoop on things they were able to negotiate, such as making the transition back to work on a part-time basis for a few weeks,"" says Ann Douglas, coauthor of <em>The Unofficial Guide to Having a Baby.</em> You may also discover that if you start storing up sick or vacation days now, you can use them for a longer leave later.It goes without saying that you'll get plenty of pregnancy advice both from books and from your doctor, but you should also talk to the real pros - the women who've been there. Get to know new parents in your neighborhood, hook up with moms in your exercise class, or chat online. Parents will be eager to offer tips on everything from curbing morning sickness to shopping for maternity clothes. And when the baby arrives, you'll have a built-in playgroup and maybe even a sitter or two.<em>Pamela Kramer, mother of two, lives in Colorado.</em>"
 The Top 10 Concerns of New Parents,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-top-10-concerns-of-new-parents,"Every day parents who bring their babies to our office are spilling over with questions ranging from what to do about diaper rash to how to get their baby to <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">sleep</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> through the night. Experts, not to mention family and friends, sometimes offer contradictory advice. Is it any wonder new moms and dads often feel overwhelmed? Being a new parent is far from easy, as my wife, Martha, and I, parents of eight, can attest. Fortunately, there are almost always ways you can soothe your baby's distress and ease your mind. Here are answers to some of the most common questions new parents ask their pediatricians.There is no magic way to get a baby to nod off. But even though you can't dictate when and how much your baby will sleep, you can create conditions that encourage sleep and provide cues that it's time to rest.    Babies eventually learn to soothe themselves to sleep. As your child grows, encourage him to fall asleep on his own by putting him in his crib while he's still awake and staying until he nods off. Once your baby sleeps through the night, try increasing the distance between you and his crib, or put him to sleep in his own room. Although sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) is quite rare (it occurs in fewer than 1 out of every 1,000 babies), it ranks at or near the top of every parent's list of worries. Don't let fear of SIDS interfere with your enjoyment of your baby. Most infants are healthy and stay that way. The following measures are effective at reducing SIDS risk:      It's best not to let your baby cry it out. Crying is her language  -- she does it to communicate, not manipulate. In fact, researchers have disproved the theory that holding a baby a lot or responding promptly to her cries makes her clingy and dependent. In one study of mother-infant pairs, some of the mothers responded quickly and lovingly when their babies cried. The others, fearful of spoiling, did not respond as quickly. The researchers found that the infants of the responsive mothers cried less frequently, were less clingy, and seemed more securely attached to their caregivers. The other babies cried and whined more often, were more insecure about separating from their caregivers, and were less comfortable playing on their own.But that doesn't mean that you need to respond immediately to every squeak. As your baby gets older, your response time can lengthen. When she is 6 months old, you can use reassuring body language and talk to her before scooping her up when she fusses. By delaying, you'll help her learn how to soothe herself.During the two years before their immune system fully develops, most babies get at least three respiratory illnesses and a couple of diarrhea-inducing intestinal infections. You can lessen the frequency and severity of sickness in the following ways:      With each interaction between you and your baby, you lay the foundation for discipline. It's by developing the right relationship with your child, rather than using the ""right"" techniques, that you start the process. To do this, you'll need to establish trust, and then you can provide structure and set limits. Childproof your home so that your baby has a safe place to play and learn. Then set limits by saying no to an exploring infant headed for trouble. When you childproof your home, you remove most of the ""no's,"" so that a ""yes"" environment prevails and an infrequent ""no"" really means something. Another way to limit saying no is a discipline trick, ""distract and divert."" Instead of saying no when your child is headed toward a flower vase, call out his name or the name of an object he likes, such as ""ball"" or ""cat,"" to redirect his attention. I believe that the main issue is not whether you work outside the home but the quality of attachment you maintain with your baby. It's important that you not let emotional distance develop as a result of your absence. Here are some ways to keep a close bond:    Since a tired mother is a tired wife, a mom's exhaustion should be an incentive for fathers to help in baby care. But some men don't know how and may need to be taught. Here's how to encourage your partner to do his share:    In the first few weeks, it's hard to tell if your baby is getting enough milk, so see your pediatrician often to track weight gain. After the first couple of months, you'll be a pro. While it's normal for babies to lose a little weight after birth, weight gain is generally the best indicator that your baby is eating enough. Infants who are well fed will usually put on an average of 4 to 5 ounces a week for the first few weeks, and an average of 1 to 2 pounds per month for the first six months.  Milestones aren't an indication of a baby's intelligence or a badge of good parenting. In fact, the age at which a child reaches a milestone isn't as important as his progression through developmental steps. For instance, most babies move from sitting to pulling themselves up to standing to walking, yet each may reach these milestones at a different age. As long as your infant is progressing and your doctor isn't worried, there's no reason for you to be. The key attribute of a good parent is responsiveness. If you are responsive to your baby's cues, even if you sometimes can't figure out what he wants or needs, you're a good enough parent, as long as you care and try.Perfectionistic feelings often surface in new parents. My advice is to relax and ease up on yourself. Remember, your baby doesn't compare you with other parents. To him, you are the most wonderful person in the whole world  -- and that's good enough.<em>Contributing editor William Sears, M.D., is the author of 30 books on childcare.</em>"
 Guide to ADHD,http://www.parenting.com/article/guide-to-adhd,"Everything <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">parents</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> need to know about Attention Deficit Hyperactivity DisorderADHD, or Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (formerly known as ADD) is a neurological condition that causes children to lose focus and behave in ways that, if untreated, may make it difficult for them to successfully participate in school, social and family life. Children with ADHD can be inattentive, hyperactive or impulsive, and many have a combination of these behaviors. Other learning disabilities or mental conditions can also accompany ADHD.Although it's the nation's most common childhood mental disorder—8 percent of all U.S. kids, which translates to about 5 million, have been diagnosed—ADHD can be surprisingly hard to spot because it affects individual children so differently. ADHD kids can be rowdy troublemakers who get into fights and fail at school, excessively chatty straight-A know-it-alls who constantly interrupt their teachers, or ""space cadets"" who stare out the window unaware that rest of the class has left for lunch. While all young children can be impulsive, hyperactive or inattentive at times, for children with ADHD these behaviors are so frequent and severe that they interfere with normal activities, often leaving them confused, frustrated, or angry.According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, boys are more likely to be diagnosed with ADHD than girls (9.5 percent of all boys, versus 5.9 percent of girls) but experts are unsure if that means more boys actually have the condition, or if they're just more likely to have the type of ADHD that results in disruptive behavior. Kids who act out, especially in school, are more likely to be noticed and referred for diagnosis than those who drift off into their own world.The good news is that a great deal of research has been done on ADHD (which has been a recognized mental condition since the 1960s) and there are a number of strategies, including medication, behavioral modification and school accommodations, that can help children manage their condition and lead successful, happy lives.  Most children are evaluated for ADHD shortly after they enter grade school because their inability to focus, follow directions and control behavior becomes a real barrier to success in that structured setting.ADHD has three subtypes; predominately hyperactive-impulsive, predominately inattentive, and combined hyperactive-impulsive and inattentive. That means your child may have all of the symptoms in one category, or several from each.The symptoms listed below come from the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual IV, (DSM IV) and are the criteria a doctor would use to diagnose your child. However, because living, breathing kids are more than a collection of lists in a diagnostic manual, we'll also provide some examples of how these behaviors can play out in real life.For the behaviors listed below to be truly considered signs of ADHD, they must last for six months, be more severe than in other children the same age—i.e., they're causing significant problems at school, home and/or in social settings—and some symptoms should have been present before your child turned 7.This is the child that gets labeled as lazy, spacey, ditzy or incompetent. His teacher may groan in frustration at how he daydreams and tunes out during class. She may come home with her sweater buttoned wrong, inside out or forgotten altogether. He may leave his glove at Little League—every single practice. Parents may have to deal with the terror of waiting at the bus stop for a child who doesn't show up because he got on the wrong school bus and didn't notice till it drove away. A child may lose friends because she forgets she was invited for a play date or walks right past playmates without seeing them because her mind is elsewhere.A child must have had 6 of the following 9 symptoms for more than six months to be diagnosed with ADHD/inattentive type:  Only about 5 percent of kids who have ADHD are classified as this type, which is typically diagnosed at preschool age. Most of those diagnosed will later go on to develop the inattentive or combined type.People think of hyperactive and impulsive kids as wild, obnoxious, bratty problem children or, worst of all, just plain bad. She may grab toys and refuse to share long after others have gotten the concept. A hyperactive child will keep playing tag while his classmates line up. He may frighten or intimidate other children by pushing or yelling, or he could be the loveable, but virtually untamable class clown. Hyperactive kids are often daredevils, prone to taking flying leaps off the couch. Parents of hyperactive and impulsive kids dread calls from school or a neighbor asking them to come get their misbehaving child, and they're driven to exhaustion by kids that never nap, sit still or stop talking.A child must have 6 of the following 9 symptoms for more than six months to be diagnosed with ADHD/hyperactive-impulsive type:  This is the most common type of ADHD, with symptoms of both the inattentive and hyperactive-impulsive types. Remember, not all children with ADHD display all the symptoms.Research has not determined what exactly causes ADHD, but scientists believe it could be in imbalance in neurotransmitters, the chemicals that regulate how the brain processes and regulates responses to stimuli. Also, a landmark 1996 study conducted at the National Institutes for Mental Health (NIMH) also found that two portions of the brain thought to regulate attention are smaller in children with ADHD. Since then, brain imaging technology has advanced and many other studies have shown disparities between the brains of children with and without ADHD, including one 2007 study that showed that the brains of children with ADHD mature in the same pattern as those of other children, but up to three years later. Scientists are still working to discover just what these differences mean.Why does one child's brain have trouble regulating attention and activity levels, while another's doesn't? There doesn't seem to be one overwhelming reason, but there are a number of factors that can make a child more likely to develop ADHD.Like many mental conditions, along with other traits ranging from diabetes to alcoholism to red hair, ADHD seems to run in families. However, since the disorder (called minimal brain dysfunction or hyperactivity in previous decades) may have gone undiagnosed, parents will have to look for clues on their family tree. School failures, delinquency, multiple divorces, employment problems and addictions can all be signs that family members may have had undiagnosed and untreated ADHD.Several studies link each of these damaging behaviors with children later developing ADHD. Smoking and drinking are linked to prematurity, another factor in ADHD, but researchers are discovering other links. For example, a 2009 British study found that smoking disrupted the thyroid function of both mother and fetus, which they theorized could lead to chemical imbalances in the infant brain. Smoking can also reduce oxygen flow to the embryo's brain.Infants born prematurely are more likely to develop ADHD as children. In 2006, Danish researchers found babies born between 34 and 36 weeks were 70 percent more likely to develop the condition later. The ""why"" of prematurity and ADHD is still a mystery, but theories include lack of oxygen and damage to the brain.Preschoolers exposed to high levels of lead are more likely to develop ADHD. The brain develops at a breakneck pace during a child's first three years, and lead is thought to disrupt enzymes needed to build the ""roadways"" of synapses and neurons that process information.The idea that sugar makes kids hyper is probably a myth. Medical evidence has found no strong link between sweets and ADHD. However, recent research has indicated that some other food additives, like artificial colors and preservatives, as well as pthalates (chemicals found in some plastics) may contribute to hyperactivity.You can't do much to prevent ADHD—more and more research links it to genetics. But you can minimize unnecessary risk factors.  <b>DIAGNOSIS</b>If you feel your child may have ADHD, your first call should be to your pediatrician. Some pediatricians feel comfortable diagnosing and prescribing treatment for ADHD, others may refer you to a specialist, like a developmental pediatrician who specializes in the condition, a neurologist or a psychologist.Since there is no blood or imaging test to diagnose ADHD, your pediatrician or the specialist will review your child's medical records and conduct a thorough physical examination to rule out other causes for your child's problems, like:  Your pediatrician may refer you to a specialist to diagnose and/or treat ADHD if she does not diagnose or treat ADHD (or she may refer you for diagnosis, but manage treatment once the diagnosis is made). Developmental pediatricians, psychiatrists, psychologists, neurologists, social workers and other medical professionals can, if properly licensed, diagnose ADHD. However, only medical professionals can prescribe medication.If your child has co-existing conditions, like learning disabilities or other mental disorders, that may influence the kind of professional you choose. You also may want to get a referral from your insurance company to ensure diagnosis and treatment are covered. Universities and large hospitals often have ADHD centers and can provide names of specialists. And of course word-of-mouth is always an excellent way to find help.You can also go to <a href=""http://www.chadd.org"">CHADD.org</a> (Children and Adults with ADD) and access CHADD's professional directory. CHADD doesn't endorse or recommend any professionals, but does provide a list sorted by region. Local chapters in your area may also be able to help.Once your doctor eliminates <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Child/Health/Guide-to-ADHD/6"">other explanations</a> for your child's behavior, your doctor or a specialist will evaluate your child for ADHD. Come to your appointment prepared.  At your appointment, your doctor will probably:  Your doctor may also want to gather information from teachers, childcare providers and others who have observed your child in his daily life before making a diagnosis.If your child has demonstrated a significant number of symptoms over a long period of time, and that behavior is wreaking havoc on his life in and outside the home, your doctor will most likely diagnose ADHD.There is no ""cure"" for ADHD, but your doctor will suggest a number of treatment strategies that can help control your child's symptoms and make it easier for him to lead a normal, happy, successful life. Common treatment strategies include a combination of medication, behavioral therapy, parent training and school accommodations. Although controversy has continued to shadow ADHD treatments, most research shows that a combination of medication and behavioral therapy is most effective for most children.Treatment can begin immediately, but while some children see nearly instant improvements, others must try a number of medications, dosages and therapies before getting optimum results.Seventy to 80 percent of children with ADHD respond to treatment with stimulants, so this is often the first line of defense. Doctors sometimes prescribe nonstimulants for the approximately 20 to 30 percent of children with ADHD who don't respond to stimulant treatment.There are over a dozen stimulant medications on the market, but here are the most common.  It seems strange that giving stimulants to an already hyper child could help, but researchers believe they may help adjust the levels of neurotransmitters in the brains of ADHD children. Stimulants can be prescribed in short-acting and long-acting forms, so your child may take medication as often as three times a day or perhaps only once a day. Medications come in pill, liquid, capsule and patch forms.Most children experience some side effects, the most common being insomnia, decreased appetite, or weight loss. Occasionally, kids will experience irritability or a ""rebound"" effect when the medication wears off. Very rare side effects can include facial tics, which most often disappear with a lower dose or change in medication, and a reduced growth rate. Kids should be screened for any pre-existing heart conditions before starting stimulants. There are two nonstimulants specifically for ADHD treatment in children.  Therapy can be important in treating ADHD, either alone or with medication. Many parents object to giving their children drugs before first trying other strategies. Others start with therapy and then progress to therapy plus medication, often when school becomes more complex and challenging. A good doctor will work with you to find the treatment strategy best suited for your family and your child. (<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/Child/Health/Guide-to-ADHD/18"">Get help starting your search</a>.)Individual and family sessions with a psychiatrist, psychologist or other counselor specializing in ADHD can help children and families deal with the anger and frustration it can cause and create a more positive environment for working on coping strategies.Medication can help a child focus, but behavioral techniques will give him (and you!) concrete methods to help change his behavior, often through charts that provide visual reminders and offer rewards for positive actions, like remembering books or standing quietly in line (For some sample free charts for every age group, go to the <a href=""http://latitudes.org/"">Association for Comprehensive Neurotherapy</a>). Children, parents and teachers or caregivers can learn behavioral therapy techniques from psychiatrists, psychologists, or other counselors (sometimes called coaches) who specialize in ADHD.Kids with ADHD don't always respond typically to common parenting techniques. If you ask them to set the table, and they don't do it, they may need a warning or two before you lower the boom. Parent training provides ADHD-specific strategies for discipline as well as teaching organization and problem-solving skills.Some tips on parenting children with ADHD include:Most children will learn from their mistakes, but ADHD children may not make the connection between actions and consequences the way parents expect. Most kids who, for example, swing from a second story banister and break an arm will know not to do it again. An ADHD child may come home from the ER, climb back up on the banister, cast and all, and break his other arm. ADHD children who push, shove and annoy other children can be puzzled when they don't have friends. Even if it seems obvious, parents should stress (in a positive and loving way) the cause and effect relationship between a child's behavior and results.While with non-ADHD children parents often can simply correct misbehaviors, with ADHD kids it is better to focus on teaching and reinforcing good behavior rather than waiting for mistakes. For instance, don't just give a time out for pushing on the playground, give your child praise or a sticker for playing appropriately.This is a good idea with all children, but essential for those with ADHD, who can't intuit what parents want if it isn't spelled out clearly for them. Don't say ""Play nice!"" Instead tell your child ""Do not hit or push. If you do, we'll have to leave the park."" Don't say ""Behave for Grandma"" but instead ""Only walking is allowed in Grandma's house"" or ""Last time at Grandma's you drew on the walls. She was sad and you had a timeout. Here is your paper. It is the only thing you are allowed to draw on.""Peer support can give families coping with ADHD encouragement, advice and information. Children and Adults with ADD (CHADD) lists local affiliates, many of which offer support groups, on its website, <a href=""http://www.chadd.org"">chadd.org</a>.Type ""natural cures for ADHD"" into your browser and discover just how many people are willing to take your money—and possibly harm your child!Currently, medical evidence does not support the idea of alternative therapies for ADHD, although there is some promising research into certain diets and neurofeedback, a form of biofeedback where children look at visual images of their brainwaves and learn to control them—therefore controlling the ADHD behaviors that produce them.A 2001 study on 56 boys with ADHD showed symptom improvement in the 19 boys who received Interactive Metronome Training, a computerized simulation of the simple piano metronome. This promising study launched a whole industry of metronome training, when really what is needed is more research.No legit scientific evidence backs up online favorites like megadoses of vitamins or herbal remedies for ADHD, and these supplements are so poorly regulated that you can never be sure what you are buying or giving your child.If you do wish to explore complementary therapies (those done in conjunction with, rather than as an alternative to, conventional medicine), try those that are first of all harmless, and second can benefit health in some way, even if they're not proven for ADHD. Examples include yoga or eliminating food additives in your child's diet. But always consult your doctor first.Also, remember that complementary medicine doesn't necessarily mean taking a pill or eating special foods. Activities like exercise, soothing music at meal or bedtime, and a schedule that ensures your child gets adequate sleep can all be considered ""therapy"" for ADHD.Public school districts are required by federal law to offer reasonable accommodations for kids with ADHD under section 504 of the Federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, a civil rights act. Your child's teacher can put you in touch with the appropriate special education administrators in your school district.Children may also qualify for school services under the Individuals with Disabilities Education Act. Your school district's special education team will know which law applies to your child. Children who qualify for services under IDEA (IDEA can sometimes provide more extensive accommodations than a 504 plan) will receive an Individualized Education Plan or IEP that will spell out just how the school will accommodate your child and what their goals for his education are. The plan will be reviewed and needed changes made each year. For more information, go to <a href=""http://idea.ed.gov"">http://idea.ed.gov</a>. Even preschoolers can sometimes qualify if they are identified through <a href=""http://www.missingkids.com/missingkids/servlet/PublicHomeServlet?LanguageCountry=en_US"">Child Find</a>, the government early intervention program, although ADHD is most often diagnosed in school-age children.Parents may be hesitant to have a 504 plan or IEP for their child for fear of stigmatizing them. (This is probably a leftover from the days when ""special ed"" was segregated from the rest of the school and often a dumping ground for anyone teachers couldn't deal with.) But a 504 or IEP is really just a way to make sure the school is working together as a team to help your child achieve maximum success in school. It also offers parents legal protection and remedies if the school does not make needed accommodations. Teachers and administrators are not going to share this information with students. And remember, ADHD is such a common disorder that it's likely numerous children at your child's school will have the most common accommodations, like extra time on tests.Parents who choose religious or other private schools will have to organize accommodations outside this official process (unless they are referred to private schools because the local school system cannot accommodate their child). These schools may not offer the same level of support for ADHD children. However, they may have smaller class sizes and other advantages for children with ADHD. Parents will have to evaluate the differences and the cost, and make the decision.You can also encourage your child's teacher or principal to attend a seminar or workshop on ADHD, where they can learn more about behavior modification and other strategies to help their classroom run more smoothly for all students.<b>CHILD'S POINT OF VIEW</b>Children with ADHD can be angry, frustrated and depressed, especially before they're diagnosed and treated. Think about it -- kids love to please. Imagine trying, day after day, and failing miserably, and wondering what is wrong with you and why you are different. Kids reports feelings of sadness, anger and frustration:  Because children don't know they have a medical condition, they may not share their feelings with parents until after they start treatment and realize the difference in their ability to keep up with peers and control their behavior. Once they realize they are not ""bad"" or ""stubborn"" or ""spacey,"" they can feel relief.""When I take my medication, I hear everything,"" is how her stepson describes it to stepmother Carla Nickerson. When Jacob Aylen's medication wears off, he tells his mother, ""I'm so confused, I need to take my pill so I can 'come back.'""Getting ADHD diagnosed and treated early can make a positive difference in a child's attitude and personality, says Karran Harper Royal, of New Orleans, the parent of two sons with ADHD, Khristopher, now 23, and Kendrick, 14. Kendrick was diagnosed more quickly than his brother because Harper Royal knew about ADHD the second time around. ""Kendrick did not go through years of getting kicked out of the classroom and it makes a difference in his whole disposition. He doesn't have that built-up anger and rage.""Some kids may be embarrassed about having ADHD. Parents, doctors and counselors each play an important role in making children feel confident and comfortable with the fact they have a medical condition that needs treatment, just like asthma or diabetes. For children who find reporting to the school nurse for meds embarrassing, long-acting medications that can be given at home and last the whole school day can help.Parents of ADHD kids often experience some of the same feelings as their children—frustration, anger, sorrow and a sense of failure.  Once ADHD is diagnosed and kids are started on a course of treatment, parents say things get smoother—but only with hard work. Parents have to rethink their discipline and organizational techniques, keep up with medication schedules, watch for troubling side effects, and advocate with schools so their children get accommodations and the best education possible. Many describe it as a full time job.""I had to stay involved every step of the way,"" says Harper Royal of raising two sons with ADHD. But the payoff, she says, has been huge.. ""I don't have to worry about my son going to jail or being a drug user."" (statistics say children with untreated ADHD are more likely to do drugs or get into trouble with the law.) ""He's made good choices.""There is no legitimate way to diagnose an infant with ADHD, but the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry says that all of the following can be signs of a tendency to develop ADHD later.  Of course many babies exhibit these behaviors and do not go on to develop ADHD. They're of more concern if the baby has other risk factors, such as a family history of ADHD or prenatal exposure to drugs, alcohol or cigarettes.Diagnosing toddlers with ADHD is extremely controversial since developmentally, most lack impulse control and have short attention spans. However, children that will later be diagnosed with ADHD can exhibit these traits to the point where they are actually dangerous—hitting, taking toys, even dashing into the street—on an ongoing basis. Children with ADHD may have frequent and violent temper tantrums, and be poor sleepers and picky eaters as toddlers. (But please remember, none of these signs guarantees your child will have ADHD!)Some parents do seek diagnosis and treatment for very young children with severe behavioral issues. But because the brain is still rapidly developing at this point and few psychiatric medications are approved for very young children since side effects can be severe and troubling, doctors are most likely to recommend only parental training and behavior modification.The vast majority of children are diagnosed with ADHD during the first few years of school when their inability to focus and lack of control make learning and social functioning difficult.Children with ADHD may be rude, aggressive or inattentive in class. They are likely to forget assignments and lose materials. Many will fall behind because of ADHD behaviors or learning disabilities, which are common in children with ADHD. However, ADHD children can be extremely bright and may compensate, working feverishly to get good grades. Children with ADHD may have difficulty behaving appropriately on sports teams, at parties and on family outings. ADHD behaviors can cause family stress and strain parental relationships and marriages.Once diagnosed with ADHD, children are most often treated with a combination of medication and therapy, however, some will only need one or the other. These therapies are effective in most children, but they're not magic—many ADHD children will struggle more than their peers to succeed in school and social environments.Early diagnosis and intervention is key to later success for ADHD children. Thanks to federal civil rights laws, public schools are required to provide accommodations or strategies and aids to enable children with ADHD to learn and compete with their non-ADHD classmates.Many kids who have the inattentive type may be diagnosed for the first time around this age. Whether your middle schooler's been recently diagnosed or not, an increasingly difficult curriculum and adolescent hormones can wreak havoc in the lives of ADHD kids (not to mention their parents!) Parents, teachers and doctors need to be ready to readjust treatment strategies, including changing medications and doses, and developing new methods for organizing more complex schedules.Middle schoolers should also begin to take more responsibility for their decisions and therapy. Some experts recommend that kids take a ""holiday"" from medication if they want and see how it affects their lives and their school performance. Otherwise it can become an area of conflict with parents.Behavioral therapy should also focus on strategies that kids, rather than parents, can employ to remember homework and materials. Color coded charts will give way to notebook or computer organizers.All teens are impulsive, but since ADHD kids can be even more so, the dangers that lurk for all teens—car accidents, drinking, drug abuse and irresponsible sex—are magnified for them. Experts used to think children outgrew ADHD in their teen years, but now research indicates that about 60 percent of children with ADHD will have the condition as adults, although symptoms become less severe over time. That's why it is important for children to continue treatment and for parents to continue to advocate for their education. ADHD students may qualify for accommodations like extra time on standardized tests in high school and college.Experts say teens who have learned how to schedule themselves and how to make appropriate decisions through therapy earlier in life will be less likely to struggle in school and with social relationships during the critical teen years. This will boost their self-esteem and lead to happier, healthier kids.There are many ADHD websites on the web, but surf carefully! Some are selling bogus ""miracle cures.""

 Veggie Delight,http://www.parenting.com/article/veggie-delight,
 Ask Dr. Sears: Raising a Vegetarian Child,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-raising-a-vegetarian-child,"<strong>Q. My daughter-in-law is raising my granddaughter to be a vegetarian. The baby is only 13 months old. Is that <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">healthy</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> for her at such a young age?<br><br>A. </br></br></strong>Yes, it can be  -- but only if your daughter-in-law observes certain nutritional precautions. It also depends on what you mean by vegetarian. Being a strict vegetarian (or a vegan) who avoids all foods of animal origin, including eggs, dairy products, fish, meat, and poultry, is very risky in kids because such diets can be too low in nutrients necessary for growing children. But in my opinion, a pesco-vegetarian diet that includes fish, dairy products, and eggs, yet excludes meat, can be extremely healthy for children of all ages. Here are the precautions your daughter-in-law should observe:<br><br><strong>Supplement with omega 3s.</strong> A strictly vegan diet is deficient in omega 3s, healthy fats that are important for growing bodies and growing brains. A child's first source of omega 3s is breast milk, which is rich in DHA, the prime brain-building fat. After weaning, seafood is the richest source of DHA, especially in the form of coldwater fish like wild salmon. Vegans sometimes argue that you can get DHA from plant sources, such as flax and canola oils, but this is not strictly biochemically correct. While there are omega 3 fats in plant foods, the body has to go through a lot of biochemical changes to convert plant omega 3's into brain-building DHA. If your daughter-in-law should give your granddaughter a plant-form DHA supplement, algae-source DHA is a beneficial one. <br><br><strong>Guard against vitamin deficiencies.</strong> While children can grow optimally on a diet of grains, greens, fruits, and vegetables, it's nutritionally risky. To make sure your granddaughter's diet is adequate in B-vitamins, especially B-12, have your daughter-in-law write down everything the child eats for a week and consult a professional nutritionist for what is called a nutritional analysis. This computer analysis of a weekly diet will reveal whether the child is getting adequate vitamins, minerals, fats, and proteins. In my practice, I recommend that all vegans have a periodic nutritional analysis. <br><br><strong>Mind your minerals.</strong> While kids can get enough calcium from plant foods, such as fortified orange juice, tofu, figs, whole grains, collard greens, and spinach, vegans are at risk for being deficient in two minerals: zinc (important for a high-functioning immune system) and iron (important for building healthy blood and brains). The best plant sources of iron are tofu, iron-fortified cereals, legumes, lentils, and beans, and the best vegetarian sources of zinc are tofu, artichokes, chick peas, beans, and zinc-fortified cereals. Nevertheless, it's difficult for children on a vegetarian diet to get the recommended daily 10 milligrams of zinc. <br><br>For the sake of nutritional safety, I recommend that all vegetarian children take a daily multivitamin/multimineral supplement, as well as omega 3 supplements. For more information, you may want to ask your daughter-in-law to read the chapter ""Raising a Healthy Vegetarian"" in my book <a href=""http://www.instore.com/instore/ppesearch?&amp;k=The+Family+Nutrition+Book+sears"" target=""_new"">The Family Nutrition Book</a>.<br><br>Remember, advising a daughter-in-law on the feeding of her own child is a tricky business. It's essential that you be both politically and nutritionally correct. And stay positive  -- she is, after all, instilling healthy eating habits and a love of fruits and vegetables in your grandchild.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>"

 The Importance of Folic Acid,http://www.parenting.com/article/the-importance-of-folic-acid,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekEven though every enriched grain product, from cereal to pita bread, now includes folic acid -- a crucial vitamin that prevents birth defects of the brain and spine -- a new study found that many women are still not getting enough. Why? A woman must consume adequate folate (the naturally occurring form in food) or folic acid during the first weeks of pregnancy -- before she knows she's going to have a baby.The study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, found that only 40 percent of Caucasian women get enough folic acid. The numbers are even lower -- 19 and 21 percent -- for African-Americans and Hispanics. ""Most nonpregnant women consume less than the recommended 400 micrograms a day,"" says Heather Carter Hamner, nutrition epidemiologist with the National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities. Since 49 percent of pregnancies are unplanned, doctors recommend that all women of childbearing age pop a daily multivitamin containing folic acid."

As a mom, I love shipping my kids off to class not only out of enthusiasm for them, but also because it means more time for me to work, do errands swiftly on my own and—perhaps most important—spend more solid time working out with less rushing. This is the perfect time of year for parents to not only gear up the kids for a tighter schedule, but also to home in on it ourselves. Some parents have additional little ones in the household, while some are on their own during school hours. Similarly, some parents prefer <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/gallery/at-home-workouts-women"">working out at home</a>, while others prefer the gym or the outdoors. Depending on your specific situation and preferences, there are a plethora of effective, fun and fabulous options for getting your workouts in. The importance of taking care of your health first is best likened to the emergency advice on an airplane before takeoff: Put <em>your</em> oxygen mask on before assisting small children or others. Exercise matters. It matters a lot.No matter your circumstances, inspire fitness with these three strategies:Plan your calendar around your workouts. If they're not a priority, it's exceedingly easy to skip them. Momentum is key for maintaining fitness, so recognizing the benefits and experiencing them on a regular basis is a wonderful, self-perpetuating positive feedback loop. The more you stick to your workouts, the better you feel and the more eager you will be to continue feeling that fantastic. It's a win-win cycle. Exercise is extraordinary for enhancing energy to keep up with your kids and your life; for stimulating immune function so you can stay healthy; and for stress management. Make ""exercise appointments"" at least four to six times per week, 30 to 60 minutes each, at home, at the gym or outdoors. Make your engagements specific, realistic and detailed. If you only have a few minutes here and there, try Parenting's <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/gallery/10-minute-workout-routine"">Easy 10 Minute Workouts for Busy Moms</a>.If you love dancing, dance. If you are inspired by a sport, play it. If moving metal is invigorating, hit the weights. There are myriad methods of moving your body in a productive way. The best exercises are the ones you enjoy doing and the ones you look forward to. If you prefer solo ventures, run, hike, walk, swim, bike outdoors or work out at the gym on your own. If social support motivates you, take classes, enlist a friend in your fitness ambitions, join a group or hire a trainer. Motivate yourself with new exercise equipment, clothing, a DVD, an online workout video, signing up for an event (such as a 5K, 10K, mud run or triathlon), or a fitness logging app. The process can morph and meld over time, which is part of the pleasure.Variety is the spice of progress. Incorporate cardiovascular endurance, muscular strength and endurance, flexibility, balance and coordination by testing and playing in multiple manners. Up the ante with increasing duration, intensity and frequency. There is always a way to kick it up a notch, and your body will recognize the difference. Make every move count.

 4 Food Label Claims Decoded,http://www.parenting.com/article/4-food-label-claims-decoded,"Is that soup or cereal really as healthy as it seems? Maybe not. How to read between the lines on packaging:<b>Claim: ""0 grams trans fat!""</b><br><b>The facts:</b> This doesn't mean that the fat the food does have is the healthy mono- or polyunsaturated kind. ""I've seen some that are loaded with an entire day's worth of bad saturated fat. It's misleading,"" says Michael Jacobson, Ph.D., executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a nutrition and food-safety advocacy group in Washington, DC.</br><b>Claim: ""All natural!""</b><br><b>The facts: </b>Sounds great, but look at the ingredient list. Some products with manufactured high-fructose corn syrup are still allowed to make this claim, even though it's essentially a high-calorie sweetener and preservative.</br><b>Claim: ""Supports immunity in kids!""</b><br><b>The facts: </b>This is a biggie because parents make the mental leap from ""supports immunity"" to ""prevents colds and flu."" And who wouldn't want to snap that up? ""You see this claim on cereals, juices, frozen veggies, and sugar-packed drink pouches. But there's nothing magical about that particular product versus another one. Any food with a decent amount of vitamins can say this -- despite whatever other processed garbage may be in it -- because the anti-oxidants in vitamins are, in fact, involved with immunity,"" Jacobson explains. And vitamins won't have any effect on kids' resistance to illness.</br><b>Claim: ""Made with 100 percent fruit!""</b><br><b>The facts:</b> Whatever the item, it's unlikely to be as good for your kid as an actual piece of fruit. And don't be bowled over by the ""100 percent"" part; it means very little if that ""real fruit"" comprises only 1 percent of the cereal bar. Check the ingredients. If fruit isn't one of the first few on the list, it probably has only a scant amount.</br>"
 Food Pyramid for Kids,http://www.parenting.com/article/food-pyramid-kids,"Our answer to the food-pyramid debate -- healthy eating guidelines that are easier to follow, designed for moms and their <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">families</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>You want to eat well and feed your child well, but the nutrition advice keeps changing. Every five years the federal government revises its Dietary Guidelines  -- and as of April 2005, those guidelines have been revised again. This time around, the government also changed its Food Guide Pyramid for the first time since its introduction in 1992.The old one-size-fits-all pyramid has been replaced by <a href=""http://www.mypyramid.gov/"">My Pyramid</a>  -- an online guide that allows people to choose from 12 different pyramids based on sex, age, and physical activity. Though the new guide has its advantages, critics argue that the updated design is confusing. And, in a continued compromise to the food industry, it does not specify which foods are healthiest, so figuring out what and how much to eat is both difficult and time-consuming.<br><br> But no matter. Because here at <em>Parenting</em>, we've created a practical plan for moms that incorporates the facts about healthy carbs, ""good"" fats, and the best veggies, grains, and meats. In fact, <em>Parenting</em>'s nutrition plan for moms isn't a pyramid, but a house  -- with nutritional smarts and easy-to-follow advice.<br><br><em>Robert Barnett is the health editor of</em> Parenting <em>and the author of several books about nutrition and dieting.</em></br></br></br></br>In contrast to My Pyramid, <em>Parenting</em>'s Good Food House for Moms* offers a clear and simple path to healthy eating. It:<br><br><span class=""blue10b"">* Uses realistic servings.</span> Who eats only a half cup of rice or pasta, a half cup of cooked broccoli, or two ounces of meat at a time? Here, servings are expressed in ways that make it clear how much food from each group is a good goal for the day (or week). <br><br><span class=""blue10b"">* Builds a foundation of the three healthiest food groups.</span> These are vegetables, fruits, and whole grains  -- and all should be consumed in roughly equal amounts. <br><br><span class=""blue10b"">* Makes room for healthy fats.</span> The new pyramid relegates bad fats to ""discretionary calories"" at its tip-top. But unsaturated plant or seed oils like olive and canola (as well as nut oils) are beneficial, as are some other sources of fat  -- like protein-rich nuts. <br><br><span class=""blue10b"">* Gives dried beans and peas, as well as soy foods, a place.</span> On ""My Pyramid,"" they're simply stuffed in with either meats or veggies, but they deserve a space of their own. Nearly perfect foods, they're rich in protein, fiber, iron, B vitamins, trace minerals, and slow-release carbs that keep blood sugar low but help to keep hunger in check.</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br><span class=""blue10b"">* Moves the spuds.</span> Potatoes are lumped with vegetables, but nutritionally, they're more like bread than spinach, so they're best in the grains section. (Unless, of course, they're french-fried or crisped into chips, in which case they belong in the ""eat sparingly"" group of high-fat foods  -- the ""attic"" of the house.)<span class=""blue10b"">* Puts the least healthy foods in their place.</span> These include some foods that were lumped in with healthy options (fatty cuts of meat, such as sausages and ribs, chicken fried or with the skin, full-fat ice cream, as well as added fats like butter and sugary treats like cakes and soda.<span class=""blue10b"">* Underscores the best choices.</span> ""Some foods within a category are better for you than others,"" says Marion Nestle, Ph.D., nutrition professor at New York University. For instance:<strong>Grains, etc.</strong> How to handle carbs in an anti-carb world? The answer: Emphasize the ""good"" ones, and watch portions. Whole grains reduce the risk of major chronic illnesses, while refined-flour foods are nutritional flops. No need to ban white bread, pasta, and potatoes (without the skin), but make at least half your servings from this group whole grains: whole-wheat bread, brown rice, corn tortillas, oatmeal, barley, even popcorn.<strong>Veggies.</strong> The best picks are nutrient-dense. Include a variety of dark greens like broccoli and spinach, and dark-yellow veggies like carrots and squash, at least three times a week. Eat plenty of other veggies (like tomatoes) too. The more color, the better.<strong>Fruits.</strong> Whole fruit is better than juice (kids should have no more than six ounces of 100 percent juice per day  -- fruit drinks don't count).<strong>Dairy.</strong> Skim milk or at most 1% milk is best (though kids ages 1 to 2 should stick with whole). For those who can't tolerate milk, there are good nondairy alternatives, such as rice and soy milk. Limit high-fat hard cheeses to small portions eaten occasionally, and count full-fat ice cream as an ""eat-sparingly"" treat  -- all those extra calories aren't worth the calcium.<strong>Meat, poultry, and fish.</strong> A little goes a long way: One five-ounce skinless chicken breast or lean cut of beef or pork provides enough protein for a woman for an entire day. Many types of fish and seafood contain omega-3 fatty acids that are essential during pregnancy and breastfeeding, and for the heart health of people of any age. But some are too high in mercury for pregnant women and kids. Safe choices: flounder, farmed trout, wild or canned salmon, shrimp, pollock, fish sticks (made without hydrogenated oils), and ""light"" (rather than albacore or white) tuna."

""But emerging science now tells us that limiting or avoiding fish during pregnancy and early childhood can mean missing out on important nutrients that can have a positive impact on growth and development as well as on general health.""The revised FDA guidelines encourage women to eat 8 to 12 ounces of fish each week. Children older than 6 months should also consume two to three portions relating to their age and caloric needs. For example, children ages 2 to 8 can enjoy 3 to 6 ounces per week.If you're an angler, limit yourself to 6 ounces of locally caught fish per week. Children may consume 1 to 3 ounces.

The only rule: avoid raw fish. Sushi is not on the menu.When it comes to encouraging your little one to eat fish, keep it simple. Avoid seasonings and sauces.

 3 Hidden Ingredients to Avoid,http://www.parenting.com/article/3-hidden-ingredients-to-avoid,"<b>Trans fats:</b> This is one bad fat that deserves to be on the zero-tolerance list. ""Just be careful not to get so hung up on choosing foods that are trans-fat -- free that you forget to pay attention to how much saturated fat and calories they contain,"" says Taub-Dix. Both types of fat contribute to heart disease and other health problems, and there are many foods with no trans fats that are loaded with cals.<b>High-fructose corn syrup:</b> Treat it as you would any other added sweetener. ""There's really no difference between high-fructose corn syrup and regular sugar in terms of how it can affect your child's weight and health,"" says Taub-Dix. Just do your best to keep overall intake low because kids are generally oversugared anyway.<b>Food dyes: </b>Your instincts are right on. ""A growing body of research has found an association between artificial colorings -- ones with numbers, such as Yellow 5, Red 40, Blue 1, and Green 3 -- and behavior problems like hyperactivity,"" says Michael Jacobson, Ph.D., executive director of the Center for Science in the Public Interest. The dyes, found in everything from cake mixes and yogurts to breakfast cereals, are being phased out in Europe, but consumption in the U.S. is on the upswing -- it's increased fivefold over the past 30 years. ""We don't know exactly why they have this effect, but they can have a big impact on some kids' behavior,"" adds Jacobson. ""It's smart to choose foods without them when you can."""
 Feeding a Preemie,http://www.parenting.com/article/feeding-a-preemie,"If you've given birth prematurely, your breast milk is ideal for your baby's needs; it's rich in antibodies and certain nutrients. But not all preemies can breastfeed successfully, and some need extra protein, iron, calcium, and vitamins A, D, and E to help them grow and gain weight.Most preemies need about 120 calories a day for each 1,000 grams they weigh. To get that amount, they may need human milk fortifier added to their diet or a special preterm or transitional formula, depending on their health and gestational age, says James Lemons, M.D., director of neonatology at Indiana University School of Medicine.     "

No government recall has been ordered at this time.The boy, Avery Cornett, became seriously ill with a suspected bacterial infection and died after being taken off life support on Sunday at just 10 days old, reports the <em><a href=""http://www.lebanondailyrecord.com/news/local/article_f67cb3fc-2b37-11e1-9173-0019bb30f31a.html"">Lebanon Daily Record</a></em>. After appearing lethargic and suffering from what seemed to be symptoms of a stomachache, he was taken to St. John’s Hospital-Lebanon, where preliminary tests showed that he had contracted a rare bacterium, Cronobacter sakazakii, which can come from powdered infant formula contaminated with it. He had been fed Enfamil Newborn powdered formula from a 12.5 ounce can with the lot number ZP1K7G, purchased at a Walmart in Lebanon, Missouri. Following Avery’s death, the Lebanon Walmart pulled the formula from its shelves; Walmart’s corporate offices subsequently moved to pull it from shelves nationwide while further investigation is underway. At this time, it is uncertain if formula from this particular lot number was also sold to other retailers.Mead Johnson Nutrition, the company that makes Enfamil, said that that particular batch of formula had tested negative for the bacterium before it was shipped to stores. Samples of the formula given to Avery have been sent to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Public health investigators are also examining environmental factors, including the water used to prepare the formula and anything else Avery may have ingested.Any customer who purchased the Enfamil Newborn powdered formula from Walmart may return it to the store for a full refund or exchange it for another brand. Parents with questions about the formula can also call Mead Johnson Nutrition at 800-BABY-123."

And after ten months of loathing chicken, you finally want to eat it -- but only if it's breaded and deep-fried. That said, you also wouldn't mind incinerating a few pounds of baby weight. If you've been following <em>Babytalk</em>'s plan since April, you've already been hard at work, stoking your self-image (no small feat when you haven't had a minute to shower in two days) and mastering the art of lunging while singing ""It's a Small World."" Now the next step, if you feel ready, is to learn the eating habits that will help you lose those pounds without starving. We've rounded up a ton of tips and strategies that promise to make smart eating easy -- and satisfying. You'll be looking and feeling slimmer all over almost as fast as you can ask, ""Do you deliver?""<strong>3 sneaky diet saboteurs</strong><br>Learn how to steer clear of these all-too-common habits and you'll be three steps closer to slim.</br><strong>skipping meals</strong> <br>Missing a meal is pretty easy to do, especially in the early days; getting the hang of feeding the baby is hard enough, let alone figuring out how to feed the baby and yourself at the same time. But making time to nosh regularly is crucial, particularly now when your body is deep in recovery mode. ""Restricting calories at this point is just another stressor on your body,"" says Samantha Heller, R.D., nutrition coordinator for the YMCA in Fairfield, Connecticut.</br>What's more, severely limiting your calories can actually keep the pounds on down the road. You'll be exhausted, hungry, stressed, and prone to making unwise food choices (say downing an entire pan of brownies), says Eileen Behan, author of <em>Eat Well, Lose Weight, While Breastfeeding: The Complete Nutrition Book for Nursing Mothers</em>. Plus, research suggests that you may actually slow your metabolism. Your body begins to think food is scarce and decides to slow down its consumption of stored energy -- otherwise known as old-fashioned fat.<strong>how to sidestep it</strong> <br>Stock your kitchen with good-for-you foods you like; our pantry list will help you plan. As for finding time to eat, try nibbling after the baby eats, when he's bound to be content.</br><strong>emotional eating</strong> <br>Grumpy, Dopey, and Sleepy aren't just some hardworking dwarfs; they're probably fitting descriptions for how you're feeling right about now. No wonder so many of us are looking for a hug ... in the form of a bowl of buttery pasta. And there's a very clear physiological reason for seeking comfort in food: Carbohydrates, when eaten alone, raise the level of the feel-good brain chemical serotonin. This happy neurotransmitter increases feelings of relaxation and well-being as well as regulates sleep and mood. So when you dig into that spaghetti, you're actually subconsciously self-medicating with carbs, says Elizabeth Somer, R.D., author of <em>Nutrition for a Healthy Pregnancy</em>. That's not the worst thing in the world -- unless food becomes your main way to cope.</br><strong>how to sidestep it</strong> <br>One key to stopping the emotional-eating cycle is simply to ask yourself why you're reaching for that Little Debbie right now. Are you physically hungry? Is your stomach growling? Or are you bored or upset? If it's the latter, remind yourself that food won't solve the problem, then do something else. Have a glass of ice water. Go outside. Pick up your baby -- anything that works for you. If you still really want a sugar hit, go ahead and have a bite or two. Just one ounce of carbs (alone) can trigger that mood-boosting cascade. One other way to beat mindless snacking? Limit access to your go-to foods. You're less likely to fall into a hand-to-mouth coma if you've got to pack up the kid and drive to snag some Cheetos.</br><strong>no time or energy to plan</strong> <br>Granted, you have likely never been this tired or stressed in your life, nor do you likely have any interest in channeling your inner Martha. So when you suddenly realize it's been nine hours since your last meal and you must eat now, you're going to grab the fastest, easiest, most inhalable food you can find.</br><strong>how to sidestep it</strong> <br>If you simply remember to combine high-quality carbs (read: whole grain) and a little protein, you'll be on your way to a healthier diet. Sure, an apple is easy, but so is an apple with string cheese. Or a banana and peanut butter. Or some chopped chicken with your rigatoni. ""These combinations will take the edge off your hunger and deliver a consistent supply of energy until you get to your next meal,"" Heller advises. Again, our pantry list will help you make sure your favorite combos are always on hand.</br>"

 A Weighty Issue,http://www.parenting.com/article/pregnancy-weight-and-health,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekGaining the right number of pregnancy pounds could seriously impact your - and your baby's - <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">health</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>One of the earliest tip-offs to being pregnant with each of my three children -- besides rock-solid, sore boobs that sent lightning bolts through my chest if I attempted any movement beyond a slow saunter -- was how much I began eating. Suddenly I was starting the day with bacon, eggs, and toast, followed by a mid-morning muffin. And all this before the telltale missed period.Apparently, I'm not alone: Our growing cultural tendency to eat more fast food, more junk, more empty processed calories, and just more in general -- even when it's a nutritious meal -- all while we sit in front of the TV or computer screen, means many women are either too heavy before pregnancy or gain too much during it. According to the most recent statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), almost one-fourth of women 25 to 55 years of age are overweight, and another quarter are obese, which means half of all women may be entering pregnancy with preexisting weight problems. When they do become pregnant, 38 percent of normal-weight women and 68 percent of overweight women see the scale soar higher than the recommended guidelines for gestational weight gain, according to a study by researchers at Cornell University, in Ithaca, New York, and funded by the National Institutes of Health.This trend presents a serious threat to babies. If a woman is overweight or obese during pregnancy, she's at greater risk of complications and birth defects that can compromise the health of her child. It has implications for her own health as well: In a recent Gallup survey, 78 percent of female ob-gyns cited obesity as the number one health threat to American women.Knowing you'll never again put on a bathing suit without wincing may not be enough to make you pass on the dulce de leche, and worries about your future health may seem too far off to sweat right now, but surely the motivation to have a healthy baby can propel you toward better pregnancy nutrition. Here's the latest research about the importance of a healthy pregnancy weight gain -- and advice that can help you achieve it.<em></em>Whether you are over- or underweight is determined by your body mass index, or BMI. Your health care practitioner can help you calculate your BMI, or you can do it yourself with this formula: Multiply your weight in pounds by 703, then divide that answer by your height in inches. Divide that answer again by your height in inches. That number is your BMI. (For instance, a 120-pound, five-foot four-inch woman would have a BMI of 20.6.) The CDC categorizes a BMI of 18.5 or less as underweight, 18.5 to 24.9 as healthy weight, 25 to 29.9 as overweight, and 30 or higher as obese.With half of all reproductive-age women tipping the scales above their recommended weight, it's not surprising that there's been a corresponding rise in the rates of the infant health conditions associated with heavier moms-to-be. While obese pregnant women are most likely to suffer from these complications, researchers are finding that those who are overweight are at risk as well.Several recent reports have highlighted the following increased dangers:<strong>Overweight and obese pregnant women have higher rates of preterm birth.</strong> Heavy pregnant women are more likely to suffer from gestational diabetes and preeclampsia (pregnancy-induced hypertension) -- both of which increase the odds of preterm labor. A March of Dimes report, <em>Nutrition Today Matters Tomorrow</em>, points to a direct link between the soaring rates of obesity among women of childbearing age and the increased rate of premature birth, which has risen 23 percent since the early 1980s. Prematurity puts infants at significantly increased risk of a host of lifelong health problems: developmental delays, chronic lung disease, and cerebral palsy to name a few. In fact, preterm birth is the number one cause of neonatal death in the first month of life.<strong>Infants born to heavy women are more likely to suffer from birth defects.</strong> Research from the March of Dimes found that overweight and obese women were reported to be 30 to 40 percent more likely than healthy-weight women to deliver a baby with a major birth defect, in particular a neural tube defect, which affects the brain (anencephaly) or the spine (spina bifida).Not only that, a study of 900 California women published last November in the <em>American Journal of Clinical Nutrition</em> found that obese women who ate a large amount of high-glycemic foods (such as white bread, cookies, sugary cereals, and soft drinks) around the time of conception were at greater risk of having a baby with a neural tube birth defect. ""Prior research has indicated that obese women have a twofold increased risk of these defects,"" notes Suzan Carmichael, Ph.D., an epidemiologist with the California Birth Defects Monitoring Program, which conducted the study. Their results showed that obese women who reported eating the largest amounts of high-glycemic foods during early pregnancy had four times the risk of neural tube defects.""While we don't know the exact reason, it's possible that obesity contributes to a problem with blood-sugar control,"" says Carmichael. High-glycemic foods tend to make blood sugar soar; in contrast, the unrefined carbohydrates in fiber-rich whole grains, beans, and vegetables result in a slower release of sugar into the blood and help you feel full longer. ""We don't want to be alarmist -- eating a sandwich on white bread will not hurt your baby. Still, the best route during pregnancy is to follow the recommendations of eating high-fiber, less-processed, and calcium-rich foods, as well as fruits and vegetables.""A study published in the May 2003 issue of <em>Pediatrics</em> entitled ""Maternal Influences on Child Health,"" had similar conclusions: It found a link not just between obesity and neural tube defects but also between being overweight and an increase in congenital heart problems as well as ""multiple defects"" (when a child suffers from more than one major malformation).<strong>Heavy women are more likely to have a cesarean delivery.</strong> Another study in <em>Pediatrics</em> found that women who gain excess weight during pregnancy account for a growing proportion of cesarean deliveries (which are now up to 26 percent nationwide, according to the CDC, the highest ever recorded) because excess weight is associated with overly large fetuses that can't be delivered vaginally. Gestational diabetes (more common in heavier women) can also cause the fetus to grow too large. ""Bigger babies are at higher risk of experiencing shoulder distocia during delivery -- the head may make it out, but the shoulders get stuck,"" notes Marcos Pupkin, M.D., chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Mercy Medical Center, in Baltimore. ""Then, we are forced to try to reposition the fetus, which can cause trauma to the baby. In some cases, we must do a cesarean, and there is a greater risk of infection to the mother because there are so many more layers of fat to cut through."" Even in the best circumstances, c-sections are considered major surgery and incur risks for the mother, including complications from more extensive anesthesia and the possibility of hemorrhage due to a surgical accident, not to mention a longer and more painful recovery period.<strong>Being overweight or obese compromises a woman's future health.</strong> Heavy women have a higher risk of heart disease, diabetes, certain cancers, and arthritis. Postpartum, a heavy woman is much more likely to retain the excess weight, compounding the problem with each successive pregnancy. ""Women who gain more than the recommended amount during pregnancy are more than four times as likely to be obese one year after giving birth,"" says Christine Olson, Ph.D., professor of nutritional sciences at Cornell.<strong>The best way to put on pounds</strong>The safe and smart amount of pregnancy weight gain depends on the individual mom, how much she weighed beforehand, and her dietary and lifestyle habits. A decade ago, the Institute of Medicine raised the recommended pregnancy weight gain to 25 to 35 pounds, to ensure optimum nutrition for the fetus. (Previous generations had been advised to gain less, with about 22 pounds being average in the 1960s.)That standard is intended for women entering pregnancy at a normal weight. Those who are underweight should gain 28 to 40 pounds; those who are overweight, 15 to 25 pounds; and those who are obese, 15 pounds, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). Within those 10- to 15-pound ranges, the low end is what the baby needs to thrive, and the high end is the limit at which moms need to stop gaining or risk their own future health, says Hope Ricciotti, M.D., assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard Medical School and author of <em>The Pregnancy Cookbook</em>. Your health care provider will suggest an appropriate weight gain based on your BMI and possibly factor in other issues, such as activity level. To gain the average of 28 pounds, Dr. Ricciotti recommends adding just 100 calories a day during the first trimester, followed by a careful, gradual increase to about 200 extra calories a day as you start the second trimester, and then 300 to 500 extra as you start the third. Translated into pounds, that means gaining about 3 to 6 pounds in the first trimester, and 6 to 12 pounds in both the second and third trimesters. Another way to look at it is 10 pounds in the first half (20 weeks) of pregnancy, and 18 pounds in the second half.Women who are very physically active or have tall, big-boned frames may be able to add as many as 500 additional calories and still stay within the recommended weight guidelines. On the other hand, heavier short women may be advised to stay at the lower end of the weight-gain range, says Dr. Pupkin. Young or African-American mothers-to-be may be told to gain at the higher end of the range because they have higher rates of preterm birth and low-birthweight babies.<strong>Avoiding pound pitfalls</strong>There are two critical times to focus on what you're eating during pregnancy, says Mary Jane Lewitt, a certified nurse midwife in Atlanta and a spokesperson for the American College of Nurse-Midwives. The first is early in your first trimester, when you should evaluate your eating habits with your health care practitioner and figure out what you need to work on. The second is at the halfway point to determine if you're where you should be weight-wise and to make changes if you're not. Beware of these common pitfalls along the way:<strong>Stay trim in your first trimester.</strong> As noted earlier, little weight gain is necessary early on. Stick to small increases in dietary protein at this stage -- only about 10 to 15 extra grams are required during pregnancy, for a total of about 60 grams a day. Three ounces of lean meat provides 15 to 20 grams, for instance, as does about 2 cups of milk or a cup of yogurt together with an ounce of cheese. If you balloon by 10 pounds or more before 20 weeks, it's probably not what you're eating but how much, notes Dr. Ricciotti. ""Women get a lot of distorted messages about eating for two. If you're gaining too quickly, your doctor may suggest that you reduce your portion sizes by 10 to 15 percent,"" she says. ""Focus on getting the recommended servings of fruits and veggies so you're filling up on healthy, low-calorie choices. It's not the end of the world if you gain 10 pounds in one month, but it becomes more worrisome if you do it again the next month.""<strong>Read recommendations carefully.</strong> No matter what the charts say, there's no need to force yourself to eat more than you feel comfortable with, especially when heartburn sets in. Nine servings of grains sounds like an awful lot, until you realize that a typical bowl of cereal is the equivalent of two to three servings. Don't forget that many foods can be counted as more than one food group: A chicken-and-broccoli stir-fry includes both vegetable and protein servings -- and grains, too, if you eat it with brown rice.<strong>Maintain at least a moderate level of physical activity.</strong> From M.D.'s to midwives, R.D.'s to R.N.'s, the consensus is to keep weight gain on track with regular exercise, ideally for at least a half hour three times a week. ""You can safely do prenatal yoga and light weight training, and use cardio equipment like elliptical trainers and treadmills,"" notes Dr. Ricciotti. Start slow, avoid overheating, and talk to your health care provider, especially if you haven't been exercising. For the out of shape, the best bet is to start a walking program, which is always safe during pregnancy. If you're starting out your pregnancy in good physical shape, daily vigorous exercise is fine as long as you avoid activities that can interfere with balance, cause injury to the abdomen, or have a high risk of falling. These include skiing (both water and downhill), surfing, horseback riding, cycling, diving, and snowmobiling. And there's more to pregnancy exercise than meets the scale: That added muscle tone and stamina may well help you endure the rigors of labor, too.<strong>Ditch (some of) the desserts.</strong> As with any real-world diet, thinking you're never going to be able to treat yourself is bound to backfire. ""Being pregnant may not mean having dessert at every meal, but it also doesn't mean you have to be perfect,"" notes Dr. Ricciotti. Have some cookies or ice cream in moderation two or three times a week if you're on track weight-wise. Or buy yourself a box of really good chocolates and savor one each night before bed.<strong>Take care of yourself.</strong> While plus-size women are at greater risk of pregnancy complications, being overweight isn't a reason to avoid getting pregnant. And the last thing you would ever want to do if you're gaining too quickly would be to go on a crash diet. Ideally, the health risks to a baby will be an incentive to eat healthfully and be vigilant about prenatal care. ""Start a nutritious eating and exercise plan now,"" adds Lewitt, ""so you can have the best possible outcome for your baby.""<em>Stephanie Wood, a mother of three, lives in Blauvelt, New York, and writes frequently about pregnancy and parenting.

 Up Your Child's Iron Intake,http://www.parenting.com/article/up-your-childs-iron-intake,"Kids often fall short because they don't eat enough meat and dark-green leafy vegetables  -- two big sources. And though breads, cereals, and other grains are usually fortified with iron, calcium can interfere with absorption in the body. If your child eats fortified cereal (the biggest source of iron for young kids) with milk, for instance, she won't absorb much of the iron.To boost intake, from Jodi Citrin, president of Citrition, a nutrition counseling practice in New York City:<b>Serve kid-friendly meat sources</b>, such as turkey sandwiches, burgers, beef tacos, and pasta with meatballs. (Serve red meats at most twice a week.) <b>Have your child drink non-calcium-fortified OJ</b> with an iron-packed breakfast, since vitamin C helps the body absorb iron. Or serve vitamin-C rich strawberries or oranges afterward.<b>While it's great to drink milk with meals</b>, you might aim for at least one meal that's a good source of iron (consisting of meat and/or fortified grains), and serve water or 100 percent fruit juice instead.<b>Serve snacks that are good sources</b> of iron: hummus (with pita for dipping), watermelon, raisins, and dry fortified cereal."
 Health Update: Nutrient Rich Nuts,http://www.parenting.com/article/nutrient-rich-nuts,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekFor a health boost, grab a handful of nuts. They're high in fiber, protein, and some surprising nutrients. Case in point: Just two Brazil nuts (about a quarter of an ounce) deliver as much of the cell-protecting antioxidant selenium as a supplement, according to a new study. Nuts are high in fat (though it's the healthy kind), so avoid packing on the pounds by treating them as a condiment instead of a snack. Sprinkle them on salads and cereal, or toss with steamed veggies, suggests Sarah Krieger, spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association.<strong>Check out how some other nuts stack up per one-ounce serving: 12-16 walnut halves</strong> = 200 percent of the recommended dietary allowance (RDA) of omega-3, an essential fatty acid (175 calories) <strong>20-24 whole almonds</strong> = 35 percent of the RDA of vitamin E, which counters cholesterol (163 calories) <strong>25-30 pecan halves</strong> = 10 percent of your daily fiber needs, plus a healthy dose of oleic acid, a cholesterol-fighting fat (196 calories)."
 Mealtime Makeovers,http://www.parenting.com/article/mealtime-makeovers,"A child's <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">diet</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> is a work in progress. Just when you think you've figured out what he'll eat  -- and won't  -- his preferences change all over again.So you wonder whether he's eating well enough. As a mother of three, I wonder the same thing. But as a registered dietitian, I know that even if a kid turns up his nose at vegetables, refuses to drink milk, or won't touch any meat except chicken nuggets, it rarely spells dietary doom. Chances are, your child's eating habits are healthier than you think, even if they could use some improvement.That's what three families found when they participated in our diet makeovers. We asked the parents to write down everything their kids ate for three days. Then we compared each child's average daily nutritional intake against what's recommended by age and found kid-approved ways for him or her to eat better.<em>Registered dietitian Elizabeth Ward's latest book is </em>Healthy Foods, Healthy Kids.<em> </em><em>Janet Zalewski marvels at her 2-year-old's energy level. ""I always wonder whether Sarah's eating enough,"" says the Chicago mom. Although she's encouraged by her toddler's curiosity about food  -- ""Like my husband, Mike, she'll try anything once""  -- she worries when Sarah sometimes won't eat what she's served. ""If she doesn't like what I make, should I offer other foods that I know she'll eat?"" It also bothers her that Sarah loves fatty foods, especially salami, hot dogs, and sausages. ""Since I'm always sure she'll eat them, I keep hot dogs in the house for a quick and easy meal,"" admits Zalewski. (To prevent choking in kids younger than 4, cut hot dogs and sausages into small pieces  -- and avoid hard candies like M&amp;M's.)</em><em><strong>Problems  -- and solutions.</strong> Sarah drinks milk at most meals and likes ice cream and yogurt, so she's well nourished in calcium and protein. But all those hot dogs and other processed meats give her too much heart-unhealthy saturated fat and sodium  -- without providing enough iron. Switching to leaner cuts of pork and beef will reduce the fat, boost iron, and lower her intake of potentially harmful sodium nitrite. Other good iron sources: eggs and iron-fortified ready-to-eat cereals.</em><em>Sarah could also benefit from boosting her intake of dietary fiber. For example, she could, as often as possible, switch from white to whole-wheat bread, from french fries to baked potatoes, and from juice to whole fruit.</em><em>There's no need for Sarah's mom to cater to her food preferences; she just needs to continue to offer a variety of nutrient-rich foods. Left to their own devices, 2-year-olds eat when they're hungry, consuming more during growth spurts, which occur less frequently than when they were babies. And Sarah's a remarkably consistent and interested eater for her age.</em><em><strong>One month later.</strong> Sarah's eating fewer processed meats and more tuna fish, eggs, and PB&amp;J and grilled cheese sandwiches. Zalewski switched her from white to whole-grain breads for toast and sandwiches. She's boosting Sarah's fruit (and fiber) intake with a few fruit smoothies a week. A tougher challenge: limiting juice consumption. ""We're both working on it,"" she says.</em><em> </em><em><strong>Breakfast</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em>   <em><strong>Lunch</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em>     <em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em> <em><strong>Dinner</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em>   <em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em> <em>Like his younger brother, 1-year-old Daniel, Fernando still drinks milk from a bottle, yet he's mastered drinking from a cup. ""Even though we don't think he eats a lot,"" says Ignacio, ""his doctor says he's doing fine.""</em><em><strong>Problems  -- and solutions.</strong> Fernando's not hungry because he drinks too much! He consumes 18 ounces of whole milk (often with cereal added) from the bottle every day  -- plus lots of fruit juice and soft drinks. Frequent snacking with large portions  -- a big bowlful of Goldfish (270 calories) plus a cup of Gatorade (60 calories)  -- also suppresses his mealtime appetite. Over time, this dietary pattern could contribute to a weight problem.</em><em>Fernando eats fast-food hamburgers frequently, which helps him meet his dietary needs for iron and zinc, and all that milk gives more than twice the necessary calcium. But the high-fat foods give him too much saturated fat, not to mention excess protein and calories. It's time to break the bottle habit, for developmental as well as dental reasons; later, he can switch to low-fat milk. Eating smaller, more nutritious snacks (such as whole-wheat pretzels or half a sandwich on whole wheat) would help enhance nutrition without squelching his desire for meals.</em><em><strong>One month later.</strong> Fernando's off sugary soft drinks and downs no more than about four ounces of juice (a half cup) twice a day. Instead of chips and crackers, he snacks on child-size portions of yogurt. He's also eating more whole-grain cereals. His appetite at mealtime has improved.</em><em>Breaking the bottle habit will have to wait until the Platas return from a long overseas vacation  -- Fernando's parents don't want to try such a big change until they're back home. He's also still very fond of high-fat fast-food meals.</em><em> </em><em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Breakfast</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Lunch</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Dinner</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em>The family's culinary open-mindedness has a downside: Adrian relies on an ever-changing menu. He's a fickle customer. Says Hale, ""It's tough to keep up  -- I never know what he'll reject next.""</em><em><strong>Problems  -- and solutions.</strong> Variety gives Adrian a big nutritional boost: He gets plenty of iron and zinc even though he takes in fewer calories than suggested for his age. (Because Adrian's growing properly, calories aren't an issue.)</em><em>More milk would give him more calcium and vitamin D. Since plain milk isn't his favorite, he could try low-fat chocolate milk and smoothies made from low-fat milk and fruit. Cheese and calcium-fortified orange juice are also good choices, although they lack vitamin D. Adrian could eat more fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, though he still does better than most kids.</em><em><strong>One month later.</strong> Adrian has doubled his whole-grain consumption and cut his juice intake by half. When he does drink juice, it's often orange juice with added calcium. Fortified drinkable yogurt has supplied some missing calcium and vitamin D. Adding chocolate bumped up Adrian's milk intake for a while, but then he lost interest; fruit smoothies didn't fly. Neither did gazpacho or cucumber salad. But Adrian does like sliced cucumbers and celery. He's also increasingly interested in learning about the links between eating right and feeling strong.</em><em> </em><em><strong>Breakfast</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Lunch</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Dinner</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Snack</strong></em><em> </em><em> </em><em><strong>Protein.</strong> It's a key building block of all cells, yet it doesn't take much to meet a child's needs. For example, eight ounces of milk (one cup) and one ounce of cooked meat (the size of a third of a deck of cards) supply all the protein a 3-year-old needs in a day. For a 5-year-old, just add one more ounce of meat and another cup of milk. Extra protein won't hurt a child with healthy kidneys, but it can crowd out nutrient-rich vegetables and fruit.</em><em><strong>Saturated Fat.</strong> A childhood diet high in this type of fat can raise blood-cholesterol levels and lead to heart disease in adulthood if dietary patterns don't change. Starting at age 2, children should get no more than ten percent of their calories from saturated fat, although it's okay to make the shift gradually. Trans fatty acids (from partially hydrogenated oils) have similar effects. To cut back on saturated and trans fats, choose leaner cuts of meat, switch from whole to low-fat milk and dairy products, minimize fried fast foods, and limit high-fat commercial baked goods and snacks.</em><em> </em><em>When introducing new foods:</em><em> </em>     Nobody's diet is perfect, least of all a child's. That's why a daily multivitamin/mineral supplement can make sense for many kids. Always check with your pediatrician about your child's individual needs. Best bet: a kids' chewable multi (or a liquid for ages 2 and under) that supplies no more than 100% of the Daily Value for the nutrients on the label. Children who don't eat meat or poultry may need one with iron too. "

Plus, you should be taking in more, so the calories you burn are more or less canceled out. As your baby gets older, and nursing becomes easier and less frequent, you're free to be more active and take advantage of the extra calories burned by nursing.<strong>You shouldn't exercise while breastfeeding.</strong> False.It's best to avoid strenuous workouts until breastfeeding is well established (by about 4 weeks), but after that, exercise won't hinder milk production. Just start slowly, build gradually, and slow down the pace if you feel fatigued or lose more than a pound a week."

 Ask Dr. Sears: Preschool Mood Swings,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-preschool-mood-swings,"<strong>Q. My 3 ½ year-old granddaughter has such <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">mood swings</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>, it's almost scary. One minute she's fine  -- playing and talking normally, but then for no reason, she gets angry and starts yelling and talking back. Is this an indication of serious emotional problems?<br><br>A. </br></br></strong>Your granddaughter is fortunate to have you as a caring grandmother. Most children at this age have some degree of mood swings, but rather than use the old cliché of ""she'll grow out of it"" or ""it's just a passing phase"" (which it could be), I believe this is behavior that warrants concern, and should be addressed. Here are some steps you might use to help your granddaughter mellow her moods:<strong>Identify the trigger.</strong> What sets off the mood swings? Is she tired, bored, frustrated, angry, or needing attention? Are there unsettling events in her family life (with friends or at school) that could be making her angry or unhappy? Is she a deeply sensitive child? While this is a positive quality trait, she may be bothered more by unsettling events than a child who is less sensitive. Try to identify the triggers and intervene the best you can. Ask yourself if there's some way that you can help her steady her moods.<strong>Chart the mood swings.</strong> Are they getting more frequent and/or severe? Are they interfering with her growth and development? If the answer is no, then you don't need to worry as much, but any behavior that is escalating needs to be addressed by a professional.<strong>Monitor her nutrition.</strong> If her mood swings are a reflection of an underlying biochemical imbalance, it could be caused by poor nutrition. I have termed this ""nutritional deficit disorder"" (NDD), to reflect the biochemical disturbance caused by poor nutrition. Stable moods require stable insulin levels and blood sugar  -- if her blood sugar goes up and down like a roller coaster, so will her moods. Some children are more sensitive to the effects of junk food than others. Take a trip through the kitchen and discuss eliminating troublesome foods from her diet with her parents. Foods that contain high fructose corn syrup, hydrogenated oils, and anything with a number symbol (like red #40) are a good start.<strong>?</strong> <em>Have her start the day with a brainy breakfast.</em> This sets the nutritional tone of the day. If she eats a high protein, high fiber, healthy-carb breakfast, such as a bowl of oatmeal topped with yogurt and fruit, she'll begin the day with stable blood sugar.<strong>?</strong> <em>Have her graze on good foods.</em> Going without food for more than a few hours can cause her blood sugar, and consequently her moods, to go out of whack. Offer snacks that are high in fiber, protein and healthy fats, such as peanut butter, fruit, and yogurt. Make homemade whole-grain cookies or muffins that are high in fiber. Above all, avoid sweetened and artificially-sweetened beverages and snacks. Eating frequent mini meals throughout the day also helps keep the body in biochemical balance.<strong>Discover her special something.</strong> Every child needs to excel in at least one thing. Help her find her special talents, whether it be art, sports, or music. When a child is involved in one thing that she is good at and likes, this will usually carry over into her overall satisfaction with herself, and lessen mood swings.<strong>Take inventory of her general health.</strong> Lack of sleep or exercise, as well as poor quality sleep can also be a factor. Just like vigorous exercise is good advice for adults with mood swings, it also works for children. Being active increases the level of mood-mellowing hormones.<strong>Check her happiness factor.</strong> Your granddaughter's overall level of happiness is very important. If a child is generally unhappy, then it becomes a bigger problem that needs to be addressed as soon as possible.Finally, determine if there is a family history of mood disorders, such as anxiety or depression. If this is the case, it would be wise to seek professional counseling, even at such a young age."

This year, new rules on what can be sold and advertised as snacks on school grounds went into effect July 1.The regulations center on ""competitive foods,"" which are foods sold in vending machines, a la carte school lunch lines, fundraisers and student stores. Under the USDA's new <a href=""http://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/allfoods_flyer.pdf"" target=""_blank"">""Smart Snacks in School""</a> standards, any snack sold on school grounds must meet all USDA requirements. This means snacks must:Jill Castle, a pediatric dietitian/nutritionist at <a href=""http://www.bundoo.com/"">Bundoo</a>, believes parents are tired of trying to teach their children healthy eating habits at home, only to have them disregarded at school. ""Too many nutrient-poor snacks (meaning they have too many calories and few or little nutrients) exist in schools, and these contribute to excess caloric intake and poor nutrient intake,"" Castle says.The main goal of the ""Smart Snacks in School"" nutrition standards is to give children healthier snack options and limit the junk food they are exposed to school.Castle says snacks are a vital part of a child's diet, and they keep kids' appetites in check to avoid overeating at meals.""Children require over 40 nutrients each day to sustain their growth and development. These nutrients must be obtained from a wide variety of foods,"" Castle says. ""Healthy snacks help kids get closer to their daily nutrition goals and meet these nutrient requirements, as long as snacks are planned with health in mind.""School fundraisers might also have to change. According to the new requirements, there are limits on the number of exempt fundraisers a school can hold. If the food being sold in a fundraiser meets all the regulatory standards, they can be sold on school campuses during the school day. But if a state agency doesn't establish limits, fundraisers can't take place in schools. Fundraisers can't go on during lunch time when other, healthier food options from the meal service are being served to kids. None of these standards apply, however, if the fundraiser is happening during non-school hours, weekends or off-campus events.The promotion of sugary drinks and junk foods during school hours will be phased out to ensure marketing campaigns around children match the USDA's health standards for school meals. Coca-Cola and Pepsi, for example, can no longer advertise their sugary drinks, but they can advertise their companies' healthier products. Any ads on cups, posters, menu boards or scoreboards at school games will eventually have to be taken down or changed.""This is just another step in taking responsibility for what goes on inside the school walls in terms of nutrition,"" Castle says. ""While school nutrition may not be perfect yet, the effort and intention to offer nutritious food to children is there and evolving."""
 No-Guilt Fast Food,http://www.parenting.com/article/no-guilt-fast-food,"In days B.C. (Before Child), you cooked. You prepared balanced dinners.

It's actually not complicated to figure out -- and you don't need to weigh or measure a thing, says childhood obesity expert and pediatrician Sarah Hampl, M.D. The answer is right in your child's hand: A child-size portion of meat is about what would fit in your guy's palm.For whole-grain carbs, such as brown rice or pasta, a serving is roughly the size of his fist -- a measurement that also applies to fruits, veggies, and dairy products such as yogurt. A serving of cheese is about thumb-size, and for munching on snack foods, think a handful. ""The great thing about this system is that it works no matter what your child's age -- because his hand grows as he, and his appetite, does. So you don't have to memorize portions,"" Dr. Hampl notes."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Artificial Sweeteners for Kids?,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-artificial-sweeteners-for-kids,"A. Babies are natural copycats, but no matter how much your son begs, I strongly advise against feeding him foods that contain artificial sweeteners, especially aspartame and even the specific sweetener you mentioned, Splenda (sucralose). Here's why:I have carefully researched the safety of <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/sugar-does-it-make-kids-hyper"">artificial sweeteners</a> for my upcoming book, The Healthiest Kid in the Neighborhood (September 2006). Even though the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has granted artificial sweeteners the status of ""generally regarded as safe"" (GRAS), I came across several controversial findings. In his book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/Excitotoxins-The-Taste-That-Kills/dp/0929173252""><em>Excitotoxins</em></a>, board-certified neurosurgeon Dr. Russell Blaylock reviews the studies on aspartame and concludes that it is not safe, especially for the growing brains of children. Aspartame contains four calories per teaspoon, compared to the 16 in table sugar. Is saving a mere 12 calories really worth the potential risks of feeding these chemicals to your child? In regards to Splenda, the manufacturer states that, because the body doesn't digest or metabolize Splenda, it is a ""no calorie"" sweetener. According to the research reports in the Federal Register (the official publication of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration), however, 20 to 30 percent of ingested Splenda is indeed metabolized by humans. And animal studies have resulted in wide individual variations concerning the amount of Splenda absorbed. Consider, also, that there are no studies on the long-term effects of the sweetener on humans, either adults or children. Even if most of the Splenda is not absorbed, as the manufacturer claims, it still hangs around in the gut for many hours—and I'm not convinced that this contributes to intestinal health!One of the most important nutritional goals in early infancy is to shape your child's tastes. You want your son to prefer the natural sweetness of real, wholesome foods like fruits and vegetables. In my experience, babies who are fed only such foods grow up to shun the chemical taste of artificial sweeteners. These children associate eating well with feeling good. When they taste an artificially sweetened drink, such as a diet soda, they often complain of ""yucky-tummy."" Their body tells them that the stuff is not good for them. On the other hand, if your infant is fed a steady diet of artificially sweetened foods and drinks, he will grow up thinking this is what food is supposed to taste like. As long as the safety of factory-made sweeteners remains in question, my advice to parents is to follow the safest route: When in doubt, leave it out.Cinnamon is a sweet-tasting spice that has recently been shown to have a beneficial effect on stabilizing blood insulin levels. Sprinkle cinnamon on oatmeal or in a smoothie. Try fruit toppings. Instead of sweetened yogurt (avoid any yogurts labeled ""light""—these almost always contain artificial sweeteners), try plain yogurt mixed with a tablespoon of fresh or thawed frozen blueberries.Although bypass-surgery nutrition falls beyond the scope of my expertise, I do recommend that you thoroughly research the advice you've been given to use artificial sweeteners instead of natural ones. Good science makes good sense, and this just does not make good sense to me. In the interest of your own health and that of your baby, I suggest you consult a nutritional expert who is very knowledgeable about nutrition following bypass surgery."
 Sit Down and Eat!,http://www.parenting.com/article/sit-down-and-eat,"Is it possible to get a toddler to sit still and eat? Yes -- for about ten minutes max, says Sandy Procter, a maternal and child nutrition specialist at Kansas State University in Manhattan, KS. A toddler's short attention span and love of exploration means nothing holds her focus for too long.To get her to stay in her chair and eat more than a spoonful:<span class=""blue10b"">Gauge her stamina.</span> Figure out her limit by keeping an eye on her (and a clock) over the course of a few meals. Then, use this to decide what to feed her, and how much.<span class=""blue10b"">Sit her down when dinner's really ready.</span> Don't call your little wanderer to the table until the broccoli's steamed and the milk's poured. Otherwise, you'll use up at least half of those precious six or so minutes!<span class=""blue10b"">Make mealtime fun.</span> Set her place at the table with cute dishes and utensils, such as silly straws or fun plates with dipping wells.<span class=""blue10b"">Let her go -- but not too far.</span> Set up a corner of the kitchen or dining room for quiet play: She can flip through a book or stack blocks while you finish eating. She'll get a view of how your family enjoys meals together, and you'll be able to finish in peace.<span class=""blue10b"">Make it clear when dinner is over.</span> Once your toddler leaves the table, put away her food so that she won't come back and munch. Soon she'll recognize that when she gets up, her meal is over. Worried she'll go hungry? Give her healthy snacks at regular times during the day so she gets the calories she needs."

 Protein Pointers,http://www.parenting.com/article/protein-pointers,"Many people these days are singing the praises of protein: Eat more for energy! Eat it to lose weight! But in fact, most of us already consume too much, say experts. Although we all need some protein  -- which is a building block for everything from blood cells to hair  -- the body can't store it. So any excess is converted to fat, a process that puts extra demands on the liver and kidneys. Plus, some research suggests that a protein surplus causes the body to lose <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">calcium</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>, upping the risk of osteoporosis.How much protein do you need? Most adults should get 11 grams for every 30 pounds of body weight. (A woman who weighs 150 pounds, for example, needs 55 grams of protein a day.) But pregnant women need an additional 10 grams per day, and kids between the ages of 1 and 14 should have an extra gram per 2 pounds of body weight. (A 40-pound preschooler should get approximately 35 grams a day.)Although many sources of protein pack a lot of fat (a 4-ounce hamburger has 28 grams of protein and 21 grams of fat, and 1 1/2 ounces of cheese provides 11 grams of protein and 14 grams of fat), not all do. See the list, below, for some leaner sources, all with under 5 grams of fat.8 oz. low-fat cottage cheese 28 g<br>3 oz. roasted chicken breast 26 g<br>3 oz. tuna (canned) 25 g<br>3 oz. turkey (white meat) 25 g<br>3 oz. trout 23 g<br>3 oz. shrimp 18 g<br>1 cup kidney beans 14 g<br>8 oz. yogurt 11 g<br>11/2 oz. low-fat cheese 11 g<br>1 cup low-fat milk 8 g</br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br></br>"

 Classic vs. Modern Formulas,http://www.parenting.com/article/classic-vs-modern-formulas,"A guide to baby formulaThe other day I was looking at the feeding instructions my mother was given when I was a newborn sixty-four years ago. She was advised to begin feeding me cereal at just three weeks of age. We know so much more about infant nutrition now, and we understand that an infant's gastrointestinal tract matures much slower than was once thought. My mother would not receive that same recommendation today, because we now understand that a baby's gastrointestinal tract is not mature enough to tolerate solids well until around six months.The infant formulas of today really are much better than they were in the days when they were composed of evaporated milk and syrup. Today's formulas are nutritionally superior to the homemade ones you mentioned. They contain better amounts of added iron, vitamins, minerals, and essential fats. And since the passage of the Infant Formula Act in 1985, formula safety is tightly regulated by the FDA.Your concern that parents of today change formulas a lot is a valid one. In my experience, often it's not the formula that causes baby to be upset, it's the method of feeding. Many parents give their babies too much formula in one feeding. For many babies, their intestinal enzymes are not mature enough to quickly digest a whole big bottle of formula. All that undigested formula can cause constipation, diarrhea, or abdominal pain. Before changing formulas, it's better to try decreasing the volume and increasing the frequency of the feedings. Here's Dr. Bill's rule of thumb for feeding babies with intestinal upsets: ""Feed baby half as much, twice as often.""But the best advance in infant nutrition lately is that more and more mothers are breastfeeding. In the days of evaporated milk formula, only around twenty percent of mothers breastfed their infants. Nowadays, in some areas of the country (especially the East and West coasts), a large percent of mothers leave the hospital breastfeeding their babies. Even though today's infant formulas are nutritionally superior to those of many decades ago, mother's milk will always remain the nutritional gold standard for babies.If you still suspect your baby needs a change of formula, you want to make sure your choosing the right formula for your child. A good baby formula should be:"
 Ask Dr. Sears: Curbing A Sweet Tooth,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-curbing-a-sweet-tooth,"Excessive junk sugars have the potential to harm a child in several ways. First, the rapid absorption of <i>fiber-less</i> (found in packaged foods, sweets, and candies) carbohydrates into the bloodstream triggers the insulin cycle, which cause a roller-coaster effect of high and low blood sugar swings. This in turn can affect a child's mood. Because fiber prevents carbohydrates from being released so quickly into your child's bloodstream, <b>feeding your child <i>fiber-filled</i></b> (found in vegetables, fruits, legumes, and whole grains) foods instead of junk foods can prevent mood swings, and it has the added benefit of greatly lowering the risk of developing diabetes.Second, high doses of refined sugar -- like the 10 tablespoons in a 12-ounce can of cola -- can depress immunity. Early on in my pediatric practice, I noticed a group of parents -- whom I jokingly labeled ""pure moms"" -- whose preschoolers were junk food deprived. Over the years I noticed that the <b>kids of these pure moms weren't nearly as sick as my sugar-loaded patients.</b>Your child enters the world with tastes programmed for sweetness; after all, breast milk is a very sweet food. The brain craves sugar as its prime energy source, and the taste buds on the tongue that detect sweetness are the most prominent in a developing infant. There's a physiological connection between carbohydrates (sugars and starches) and cravings; carbohydrates trigger increases in seratonin and endorphins, mood-regulated hormones. The brain acts as a ""carbo hog,"" meaning that if the body does not get enough sugar to satisfy the brain, the brain actually triggers the release of neurochemicals that make a person crave more.According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, children need at least 50 percent of their daily diet in the form of carbohydrates. As a general guide, remember a good carbohydrate is fiber-filled and a bad carbohydrate is fiber-less. Get used to reading nutrition labels. A fiber-filled carbohydrate will have whole grains listed in the ingredients and at least three grams of fiber per serving, while a packaged, fiber-less carbohydrate will usually have zero grams of fiber.In our own family, we became more experienced and knowledgeable on the importance of eliminating junk food in our children's diets with each successive child. Our last four children were so junk food deprived that we seldom let a morsel of packaged, junk carbohydrates enter their mouths. Then, when they entered the world of junk food at birthday parties and preschool, we noticed that although they would delight in a piece of birthday cake or candy, they did not overdose. And if they did overindulge on junk carbohydrates, not only did the food taste foreign to them, they felt ill afterwards and would report having a case of ""yuck tummy."" Because they had been fed nutritious food during the first three years, they made the connection between eating good and feeling good and eating bad and feeling bad. We had programmed them to crave nutritious foods and shun junk foods.The key to guiding your child's cravings in the right direction is to get an early start. Keep your New Year's resolution to feed your child a right-carbohydrate diet, and you will give him the best nutritional beginning."
 Ask Dr. Sears: Soda: Just Say No,http://www.parenting.com/article/ask-dr-sears-soda-just-say-no,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your week<br><strong>A. </strong>As a general guideline for foods and drinks during pregnancy, if it isn't good for mother, it isn't good for the baby. Most <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/article/soda-savvy"">sodas</a> have a nutritional double fault—too much sugar and too much caffeine—not to mention artificial colors and flavors. The sugar/caffeine combination sends bodies and minds on an uncomfortable, and unhealthy, biochemical roller coaster ride. Here's the scoop on soda:</br>A 12-ounce can of soda contains about ten teaspoons of sugar. When you gulp a can of soda, the sugar gets into your bloodstream too fast. This sends your blood-sugar levels really high, and triggers an insulin burst. Eventually, you crash, as you go from high to low blood sugar—a yucky feeling dubbed ""sugar blues."" Then, the low blood-sugar level causes you to crave more sugar, and it's back to the soda again.The repeated ups and downs don't just make you feel bad—it has a definite impact on your baby. A steady insulin level is important for your baby's optimal growth. When you do drink sodas, drink them with meals containing protein, fat, and fiber, which slow the absorption of the sugars into your bloodstream.Don't be misled by that common sugar substitute, high fructose corn syrup. This sweetener is just as bad for your body. In fact, recent research suggests that beverages with high fructose corn syrup are prime contributors to the epidemic of childhood and adult obesity. And don't think that you are making a smarter decision by drinking diet sodas. Artificial sweeteners have never convincingly been proven safe during pregnancy. Plus, diet sodas still contain caffeine.Like the law of gravity, chemicals that go up in the body must come down. The high you get from caffeine in soda is followed six to eight hours later by caffeine low, making you feel tired and even depressed. Caffeine also triggers hormones that release stored sugar in the liver, exaggerating the roller-coaster effect of sugars. So you get caffeine high that produces a sugar high, followed by a sugar low, then you crave more caffeine to get high again. Your body is on two biochemical roller coasters.There are other side effects of caffeine that pregnant women should watch out for. Excess caffeine during the day can interfere with the quality of your sleep—sleep that you certainly need while pregnant. And beverages with caffeine have a diuretic effect, which may contribute to dehydration, constipation, and extra trips to the bathroom during the night.Four 12-ounce cans of soda a day come to about 600 calories. That translates to a pound of extra fat gain a week, putting you at risk for a more difficult delivery and increasing the chances you might develop gestational diabetes. These are ""empty calories,"" meaning they don't provide any of the nutrition you need. And because fluids are not filling, it's easier to overdrink than to overeat. You get filled up and lose cravings for nutrition that both you and your baby need. If all this isn't bad enough, consider this: The fizzy stuff in sodas is called phosphate. When phosphate gets into your bloodstream, it goes looking for its partner, calcium. It steals calcium out of your calcium bank, your bones.I definitely recommend you wean yourself off caffeine-containing sodas while pregnant. Just don't buy them—out of sight is out of stomach. When you have to drive to get a caffeine-containing drink, you'll think twice. Try a comforting cup of warm water instead. It's calorie-free and junk-food-free. You owe it to your health—and that of your baby—to have as pure a diet as possible during your pregnancy. "
 6 Ways to Encourage Your Child to Eat Fish,http://www.parenting.com/article/6-ways-to-encourage-your-child-to-eat-fish,"Nutritionally speaking, fish is a great catch for kids: The omega 3's in fatty fishes like salmon have brain-boosting power, and some varieties are rich in vitamin D, which experts are urging everyone to get more of. Plus, the American Academy of Pediatrics says fish is fine for kids under a year old. In fact, a new study has found that babies who eat fish before 9 months have a reduced risk of developing eczema. Of course, you'll want to skip ones that are high in mercury (swordfish, shark, tilefish, king mackerel, and white albacore tuna), but barring those, the ocean is yours! How to bring out the seafood lover in your child: 1. <b>Be super-picky when it comes to bones.</b> Just one stray can be irreversibly ""ewwww""-inspiring for some kids (not to mention potentially dangerous). 2. <b>Keep it moist.</b> Poaching any type of fish, especially white-fleshed ones like flounder and sole, in a little water or broth will allow it to cook thoroughly without drying out, says Annabel Karmel, author of the book <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743289579?ie=UTF8&amp;tag=parentingcom&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=9325&amp;creativeASIN=0743289579"" target=""_new""><em>Top 100 Baby Purees</em></a><img alt="""" border=""0"" src=""/sites/parenting.com/files/imagecache/article_image_center/article_images/ir?t=parentingcom&amp;l=as2&amp;o=1&amp;a=0743289579"" style=""BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; MARGIN: 0px; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none"">.

Shop for pre-prepped fish sticks (check labels for baked ones made from whole fish fillets with no fillers), salmon burgers, or marinated fillets that you can just heat and serve. Done! 5. <b>Deem it dippable.</b> Serve up fish sticks or bite-size pieces of those store-bought salmon burgers with ketchup, tartar sauce, honey mustard, or ranch. 6. <b>Sneak it in at snack time.</b> Mix canned wild salmon with mayo or plain Greek yogurt and spread on whole-grain crackers."

But it can also be healthier foods, like strawberries dunked in warmed-up Nutella, a great fruit crisp with an oat crumble topping, or pudding made with low-fat milk,"" says Kathy McManus, R.D., director of the department of nutrition at Brigham and Women's Hospital, in Boston. Even a small dish of Lucky Charms (or another sweet cereal that you'd rather they not load up on for breakfast) can be a winner as an after-meal treat.<strong>Don't make it forbidden.</strong> Try to remember: Everything is okay in moderation, says McManus.<strong>Offer it often, but not every night.</strong> ""I think it's fine to include three times a week or so, but it should be something that is treated as fun and a little special,"" says McManus.<strong>Try explaining it to your kid</strong> this way: <em>There are healthy foods I want to make sure you get every day and others that aren't as nutritious -- even though they may taste good. So we don't have dessert every night.</em> Then just leave it at that. ""The more you explain and debate the issue, the bigger it gets built up in your child's mind,"" says Sarah Hampl, M.D., a pediatrician at Children's Mercy Hospital, in Kansas City, MO.<strong>Your child needn't clean his plate before he gets dessert.</strong> ""That encourages overeating and teaches your kid to disregard his internal hunger cues,"" says McManus. ""You can, however, make sure he tries a bite of everything first."""
 Healthy Drinks for Kids,http://www.parenting.com/article/healthy-drinks-kids,"What <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">your kids</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span> drink is as big a part of nutrition as what they eat. Here's what they should be sipping to stay healthyWhat kid wouldn’t want to try your fizzy pink soda or foamy vanilla latte? While a taste here and there isn’t a big deal, it’s best to stick with the classics when it comes to daily drinks: milk, a little juice…and lots of plain ol’ water. Babies get most of the fl uids they need during the first year from breast milk or formula. But water is best for keeping kids older than 1 hydrated and healthy, and staving off fatigue, muscle weakness and headaches. “Developing a taste for water is important because kids who consume too many sweetened beverages may come to expect that every drink should be sugary,” explains Nicolas Stettler, M.D., an associate professor of pediatrics and epidemiology at Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia and a member of the American Academy of Pediatrics Committee on Nutrition.Here, the lowdown on all things liquid, and how often your child should sip:Give whole milk to kids ages 1 to 2 (unless there’s a family history of obesity or heart disease, in which case reduced-fat milk can be considered, but talk with your pediatrician first). Fat-free milk is best after age 2; it has all the vitamin D and calcium your child needs, without the added calories.As needed, depending on activity level, climate and weight . No H2O fans in your house? Try flavoring it with crushed berries , or decorate it with funny straws or ice cubes.If you decide to offer one, choose a drink that’s sugar-free. Just know that these are simply tinted water with added vitamins (which kids usually get enough of in their regular diet).Serve only 100 percent juice, without added sugar. Kids ages 1 to 6 years can have four to six ounces a day. “Too much adds a lot of calories and not as much fi ber as a piece of fruit,” says Dr. Stettler.Soda is basically liquid candy, offering <a href=""http://www.parenting.com/blogs/show-and-tell/melanie-parentingcom/kids-should-avoid-energy-and-sports-drinks-says-aap"">nothing of nutritional value.</a> And caffeine (in coffee, tea and most energy drinks) is a stimulant —plus, it’s addictive. “For a special occasion, a bit of soda is fine, but it shouldn’t be something kids drink with any regularity,” says Dr. Stettler."
 How Many Calories Do You Consume While Eating Out?

Well, soon you'll be forced to face the truth, that maybe it is. Today the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that chain restaurants with at least 20 locations will be required to post the calories in their menu offerings.This new FDA measure seems to be prompted by the fact that on average, Americans are spending half of their food dollars eating away from their homes. And the obesity epidemic continues to, well, grow.""Americans eat and drink about one-third of their calories away from home, and people today expect clear information about the products they consume,"" FDA Commissioner Margaret A.

Even some single serve grocery store items and alcoholic beverages are included in the new ruling.Yup, no matter where you're sneaking a snack, you'll be held accountable by the FDA. But maybe that's a good thing.Margo Wootan, director of nutrition policy at the Center for Science in the Public Interest told <a href=""http://mobile.nytimes.com/2014/11/25/us/fda-to-announce-sweeping-calorie-rules-for-restaurants.html?referrer=&amp;_r=1"" target=""_blank"">The New York Times</a>: ""Right now, you are totally guessing at what you are getting. This rule will change that.""According to NPR, listing calories on foods has only been shown to be effective for some people. For some, seeing exactly what they're eating is almost like a rude awakening. But nutritional information is not a deterrent against overeating for others.Hopefully, the restaurants affected by this new ruling will also take this opportunity to review their menu offerings. If consumers stop buying the calorie-laden foods and drinks they once consumed without thinking twice, perhaps healthier options will become more popular due to natural supply and demand.""<a href=""http://www.parenting.com/news-break/woman-starts-cuddling-business-guess-how-much-sessions-cost"">Woman Starts Cuddling Business; Guess How Much Sessions Cost</a>,"" and don't forget to like us on <a href=""https://www.facebook.com/Parenting"" target=""_blank"">Facebook</a> and <a href=""https://twitter.com/parenting"" target=""_blank"">Twitter</a>!"
" Eat All Day, Lose Weight",http://www.parenting.com/article/eat-all-day-lose-weight,"<p class=""week-display-title"">find your weekThe smart way to drop pounds, especially as a stressed <span class=""vm-hook-outer vm-hook-default""><span class=""vm-hook"" style=""color: rgb(0, 153, 0); border-color: transparent transparent rgb(0, 153, 0);"">new mom</span><span class=""vm-hook-icon"" style=""display: inline-block;""></span></span>Once you have a baby, preparing a proper breakfast, lunch, or dinner (let alone sitting down to eat it) suddenly becomes a luxury you can't afford. But your new hectic lifestyle -- in which you grab food between sessions of feeding, burping, and playing with your infant -- has an unexpected benefit: It may help you drop a few of those postbaby pounds. Turns out, consuming three big meals a day isn't the healthiest eating plan, after all. ""Eating smaller meals and snacks throughout the day is optimal for keeping your metabolism working at its best and your moods up -- especially when your body is trying to regulate its hormones after pregnancy,"" says Melinda Johnson, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. Here's the smart way to do it:<strong>Control your portions</strong> Even though you'll be eating more often, that doesn't mean you can simply eat more (sigh). Think of it this way: If you cut each of your three main meals roughly in half, you get to eat six or seven smaller meals per day. You can even go for eight of these mini-meals/snacks per day, as long as you shrink them accordingly. Have trouble managing your portion sizes? Stock up on snacks that come commercially packaged in 100-calorie servings. Or try divvying everything up into single portions at the beginning of the week: Count almonds into one-ounce (22 nuts) piles and stash them in plastic bags (might this be a wonderful job for your well-meaning mother-in-law?); divide leftover turkey chili into one- or one-and-a-half-cup containers; and ask the deli guy to pack your pound of roasted turkey slices into four separate 4-ounce packages. ""Eyeballing things often doesn't work when you eat frequently,"" says Madelyn Fernstrom, Ph.D., director of the Weight Management Center at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. ""If you measure things out, it becomes much easier to say, 'I'll have just this portion' -- and you still have the satisfaction of eating to the bottom of the bag.""Ultimately, to lose weight, aim for 1,500 to 2,000 calories per day, depending on your needs. If you're breastfeeding (which expends approximately 500 calories a day) or you're training for a 10K (as if), stick to the higher end of that range. Expect to lose about a pound a week if you're also keeping moderately active.<em>Nicci Micco is a freelance health and nutrition writer in Burlington, Vermont. She is also the cofounder of <a class=""vglnk"" href=""http://WhatRealWomenEat.com"" rel=""nofollow""><span>WhatRealWomenEat</span><span>.</span><span>com</span></a>.</em>Snack on a variety of healthy foods to help stabilize your moods. Just as hunger makes you feel grumpy, not eating the right stuff can also affect your mental state. Fad diets that eliminate entire food groups can wreak havoc on your emotions and may even make a case of the baby blues feel worse, says Becky Hand, R.D., a dietitian for <a class=""vglnk"" href=""http://SparkPeople.com"" rel=""nofollow""><span>SparkPeople</span><span>.</span><span>com</span></a>, a fitness and weight-loss website. In particular, she says, ""it's crucial to stay away from very low carbohydrate diets after pregnancy because the brain needs carbohydrates to function properly."" And when you're operating on less than four hours of sleep, your brain needs all the help it can get. Just make sure you focus on healthy, fiber-rich carbohydrates: oatmeal, brown rice, popcorn, whole-wheat pasta and breads, sweet potatoes, and apples. If you're eating lots of refined starches and sweets or candies and sodas -- which are digested rapidly -- you won't feel satisfied for very long after eating (or make much headway on meeting your nutrient needs, for that matter), even though you've consumed a lot of calories. Besides, studies show that women who eat more fiber are leaner.To keep your appetite in check and your energy levels and emotions steady, try to balance most meals and snacks with a combination of healthy carbs and lean proteins (low-fat dairy, lean meats, nuts). Some foods, such as yogurt and beans, offer a built-in balance of carbs and protein. Other good combinations:<strong>Honor your hunger</strong> Space out eating for appetite control -- and maximum energy. You're so busy trying to take care of everything around you -- your fussy baby, the laundry on the floor, the pile of paperwork you really need to complete -- that you ignore the hunger signals that have been surging around inside for hours. ""New moms often don't pay enough attention to themselves,"" says Johnson. ""They plow through the chaos. It's important to check in every few hours to ask yourself if you're hungry."" (Don't eat if you're not hungry, says Johnson, but do remind yourself to chug a glass of water, especially if you're breastfeeding.) Other moms ignore their growling stomachs because they feel like they have to wait until a certain time before it's ""okay"" to eat. But paying no mind to your hunger until you're ravenous never has a happy ending. ""You get so hungry that you'll basically eat whatever's in sight -- and too much of it,"" says Ruth Frechman, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association.When you were pregnant, your diet was so healthy that you sometimes felt like a poster child for optimal eating. You noshed nutritiously because you were committed to providing the best for your growing baby. Keep up the good work: Your health depends upon it now, particularly if you're breastfeeding. Certain vitamins and minerals, including folic acid and calcium -- two nutrients that many women fall short on -- are maintained at ideal levels in your breast milk at the expense of your reserves. ""If you're not getting enough calcium through your diet, your body pulls it from your bones, putting you at risk for osteoporosis,"" says Frechman. Folic acid is important for heart health and for preventing birth defects in future pregnancies. You also need to replenish the iron stores that were depleted during your last trimester (when you were building up your baby's stores) and through blood loss during the delivery, especially if you had a cesarean section. Protein needs increase slightly, too, when you're breastfeeding. Include these ""super"" foods in your diet to cover your nutritional bases:<strong>Indulge in chocolate</strong> Or chips. Or ice cream. The point is, don't outlaw your favorite foods; factor them in. Plan a daily treat (100 to 150 calories) of whatever you crave: Hershey's kisses, an ice cream sandwich, or BBQ chips. ""It's much better to have 150 calories' worth of real cookies than to have a big serving of low-fat, artificially sweetened ones -- and still feel like you deprived yourself of what you really want,"" says Fernstrom."
 Raising a Vegetarian,http://www.parenting.com/article/raising-a-vegetarian,"<b>Calories and fat.</b> Your child needs adequate amounts of both to grow. Without energy-dense meat, she'll need to compensate. To boost intake, use energy-rich, less saturated fats such as olive and canola oil. Mix in with pasta, or have your child dip bread in oil.<b>Protein and calcium.</b> Vegans, who don't eat dairy or eggs, may not get enough. Soy products, legumes, and nuts provide protein; broccoli, tahini, fortified soy milk or OJ, and dried figs are nondairy sources of calcium. <b>B12, iron, and zinc.</b> Vitamin B12 is found only in animal products, and veggie sources of iron and zinc can be tough to come by. (For iron, they include spinach and pumpkin seeds; for zinc, sunflower seeds.) Load up on all three with fortified cereals, veggie burgers, and breads."
 Soy: Is It Unhealthy for Kids?,http://www.parenting.com/article/soy-is-it-unhealthy-for-kids,"The bottom line: Adding soy to your family's diet is a smart move. Here's how you can do it on the sly:* Mix four to six ounces of tofu into a pound of ground beef or turkey when making burgers or meat loaf.* Swap soy milk for cow's milk in a breakfast smoothie (or in a shake for dessert).* For every cup of wheat flour, replace two tablespoons with soy flour the next time you make cookies or bread. It adds protein without changing the texture or flavor.* Top a homemade pizza with half soy cheese and half mozzarella. You can even try subbing in soy pepperoni."
 Ways to Save Time and Eat Better,http://www.parenting.com/article/ways-to-save-time-and-eat-better,"<b>Stop serving only ""kid"" food.</b> ""Offer kids food you like to eat-if they're hungry, they'll try it,"" says Krieger. You'll avoid extra calories from scarfing down leftover mac and cheese and they'll learn good habits.<b>Keep your pantry and freezer stocked with healthy choices</b> like beans, tuna, and frozen peas so you can make a fast, nutritious meal without a last-minute run to the grocery store (or pizza place!).<b>Slip in fruits and veggies wherever you can.</b> A favorite breakfast of Krieger's daughter is French toast with peaches on top.
